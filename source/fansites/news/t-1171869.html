The first person to loot the boss with the quest got it.<br />
<br />
Also, don't forget that you could originally get Elementium Gem Cluster (http://www.wowdb.com/items/77952) from LFR on the Patch 4.3 PTR, which turned out to be a bug. When introducing the Raid Finder (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/200831-raid-finder-coming-in-patch-43/), Blizzard said &quot;Also, there are certain items, as well as components for legendary weapons, which will not drop in Raid Finder raids&quot;.<br />

Legendary Questline Update<br />
After meeting (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/31488) Wrathion and sharing a drink (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/31454) with him, he gives you a quest (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/31473) that requires you to collect Sigil of Power (http://www.wowdb.com/items/87208) x 10 and Sigil of Wisdom (http://www.wowdb.com/items/87209) x 10. <br />
<br />
When LFR opened for testing tonight, we found that Sigil of Power (http://www.wowdb.com/items/87208) drops from every boss 100% of the time. It appears as a quest objective in the tooltips for most bosses in Raid Finder difficulty, but drops from all of the bosses that have been killed so far. <br />
<br />
Earlier today, we saw that Sigil of Wisdom (http://www.wowdb.com/items/87209) appeared as a quest objective on Grand Empress Shek'zeer's tooltip (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/august/wisdom.jpg) in 25 Man Normal Difficulty Heart of Fear (http://www.wowdb.com/zones/6297-heart-of-fear). Unfortunately, no one was able to kill her to confirm that it actually drops. Keep in mind that this is beta and things can change in the future and may not be working as intended.<br />
<br />
Once 10 of each Sigil has been collected, Warthion sends you into the Terrace of Endless Spring (http://www.wowdb.com/zones/6067) to defeat the Sha of Fear. Before entering the Terrace of Endless Spring, you must have completed the Heart of Fear raid. Upon defeating the Sha of Fear you will loot a Chimera of Fear (http://www.wowdb.com/items/87210) from him and bring it back to Wrathion. <br />
<br />
When the items that you collected are combined, you will be able to choose from (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/31482) a Crystallized Dread (http://www.wowdb.com/items/89873), Crystallized Horror (http://www.wowdb.com/items/89882), or Crystallized Terror (http://www.wowdb.com/items/89881) gem. These gems are unique equipped, and go into a Sha-Touched socket in the weapons below. These weapons drop from bosses in Terrace of the Endless Spring and the last boss of Heart of Fear. <br />

There are also achievements that hint at the questline continuing in patches that come after 5.1.

New Character Creation Preview Gear<br />
This build finally finished adding the last of the new character creation gear used in the preview. This is not the gear that your character will get when starting the game, but the gear that is used to show you what a higher level character will look like. Keep in mind that this is beta and things can always change!<br />

Beta Class Balance Analysis<br />
Pretty much this...for some reason devs think most progression guilds are quite happy to bring an underperforming player to a progression fight (Obviously none of them are in progression oriented guilds).<br />
Actually, several designers have been farming Heroic Madness of Deathwing (some on 25, some on 10), for over 6 months. Some of them are in very performance-intensive guilds too, that definitely adjust raid comp based on individual performance above all else. In any event, you don't make a stronger case for yourself by arguing that the designers must lack your experience. And, as has been stated multiple times, this thread is for discussing numbers and mechanics, not making anecdotal accusations.<br />
<br />
The point is this: Would your raiding developers ever bring the MoP Affliction Warlock to a unnerfed Heroic Spine-like fight? Desto and Affliction locks did not have competitive burst. Demo lock was there as the buff bot and actually did pretty decent damage as long as the lifts were no often than every 2 minutes.<br />
<br />
Current Affliction damage is fairly stable until execute, with no real spikes or troughs. We still cannot bring competitive burst, unless my sims are incorrect. We will be sat for these encounters or respec, just like we were in Cata. Oh and we will be sat for AoE fights as well since things will be dead before we even get going. Spine left some pretty deep scars I must admit.<br />
Heroic Spine is an extremely skewing fight, as it forced you to value 20-second burst damage every 1:30 to 2:00 over just about everything else. It’s no surprise when that does unfortunate things to class/spec balance. We try to balance different specs to do similar sustained damage, but allow them to have different strengths and weaknesses, such as burst potential. One of the class designers (who also happens to be a raid leader in a 25-player raid progression guild) says that if there were a similar encounter in Mists of Pandaria, he would definitely ask his warlocks to switch to Destruction, given that Destruction’s potential 20-second burst is incredibly high. Warlocks would definitely not be sat in that situation.<br />
<br />
It seems that Halo and Divine Star have a DR now... is it at &quot;beyond 6&quot;, similar to Sanct/Healing Rain?<br />
Yes; we recently did a pass on making sure that new AoEs were appropriately following our standard AoE capping rules (10 targets for damage, 6 targets for heals). There were a number of Monk AoEs and a few other class level 90 talents affected, I believe.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/269-Death-Knight))<br />
In the current beta build when an unholy death knight uses blood boil (speced into Rolling Blood), blood runes don't turn into death runes (Reaping effect). Just an obvious bug which we can hopefully see fixed in a later build.<br />
Fixed for the next build.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/271-Hunter))<br />
After some discussion with a fellow hunter, I have been questioning the worth of Focus Fire. In its current state, it seems that casting Focus Fire could actually result in a net DPS loss, based on information gained using Zeherah's sim and personal observations.<br />
We did notice this and have buffed it a bit, but that change didn’t make the build you’re just now getting. I believe the amount of haste it grants your character went up to 6% and we might need to increase it further. It should be a significant DPS increase, not just break even.<br />
<br />
Hunter level 90 talents (glaive shot, etc.) appear not to be triggering Marksman mastery. Is that intended? <br />
<br />
Murder of crows benefits from BM mastery, but Dire Beast does not. What's the intent here (e.g., presumably Lynx Rush benefits from it)?<br />
The Hunter level 90 talents should trigger Wild Quiver, with the exception that Barrage has 1/6th the normal proc rate (so that it isn’t overwhelmingly dominant for Marksmanship).<br />
<br />
The next build will include a new version of Murder of Crows. It’s mostly a mechanic and visual change; the damage should remain roughly the same, including being affected by Master of Beasts. Dire Beast will also be affected by Master of Beasts in the next build (so that the entire talent row is consistently affected by it).<br />

Latest finds from doing hitting dummies for an hour.<br />
<br />
Judgment can be dodge/parried from 30 yds away<br />
Hammer of the Righteous is really bugged.<br />
Nova is doing only 1-2 damage at several AP levels<br />
It really only hits for 0 yds.<br />
These are simple bugs, and are fixed for the next build. Also, a clarification on the previous update about Judgment and its interaction with seals: Seal of Truth will affect Judgment (both damage and Censure application). The other seals will not.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/277-Warlock))<br />
Another bug which may confuse Affliction warlocks in the current beta build is Malefic Grasp’s interaction with spell haste. It is appropriately getting its period reduced by haste, but the channel bar is incorrectly still 4 seconds long. The debuff it applies is the accurate duration. It should not gain additional ticks with additional haste. The channel bar will be fixed in the next build.<br />
<br />
Sorry but I am confused. Can you please explain this a little better? Are you saying that the MG ticks benefit from haste but the extra dot damage is still every 1 second? Or are you saying something else?<br />
No, the extra DoT ticks are directly tied to the MG damage ticks. The bug is simply that the channel bar UI is not being affected by haste. The gameplay functionality is correct.<br />

World Boss Availability<br />
I understand that Mogushan Vaults is going to be out a week after the xpac drops, but what about the 2 world bosses? Will those be spawning and killable the week of the xpac?<br />
Yes, world bosses will be available on day 1. Oh, the days of trying to down Azuregos. September 25 is going to be epic!

Teleports Rewarded by Gold Medal Challenge Modes<br />
They share a cooldown with each other, but not with the hearthstone or other player spells like shaman Astral Recall or mage Teleport. Whenever you complete a challenge mode, this shared cooldown is reset.

<br />
LFR Rewards and Difficulty<br />
While LFR difficulty requires less coordination and organization than normal raids, it still generally takes more effort than completing a heroic. Therefore, shouldn't the rewards be greater? <br />
<br />
Also, I think people generally like the normal dungeon&gt;heroic&gt;LFR&gt;normal raid setup. Removing a step would give people less diversity. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/231318-lfr-is-good-but-maybe-just-needs-a-new-take/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/5058486017?page=1#9))<br />
<br />
Content Difficulty and Consumption Speed<br />
As my son (Lambey) pointed out a number of times, releasing LFR this early into a patch means content gets done on week 2 its out.<br />
personally me AND my son feel the schedule needs to be adjusted to the following:<br />
<br />
September 25: MoP launches<br />
October 2: Mogu'shan Vaults (normal) opens<br />
October 7: those who cleared normal Vaults can access heroic mode<br />
October 30: Heart of Fear and Terrace of Endless Spring (normal) open, with Terrace only accessible by clearing Heart. LFR difficulty for Mogu'shan Vaults opens.<br />
November 6: Those who cleared normal Heart can access heroic Heart, same for Terrace.<br />
November 27: Lfr for Heart Opens.<br />
December 11: Lfr for Terrace Opens.<br />
<br />
This means that even a month later, the content has NOT been burnt out by the casual gamers. it also allows raiders to feel somewhat superior as they are seeing content others arent, while also providing incentive for players to at least TRY normal mode raids!<br />
If others want to try and burn the content in two weeks through LFR. How is your gaming experience diminished by it? I can't honestly understand what's the big deal on people that isn't you doing something that you don't want to do. I mean, what could you possibly do when someone that is not you storms Mogu'shan Vaults on the LFR...<br />
<br />
it also allows raiders to feel somewhat superior as they are seeing content others arent <br />
Perhaps we should just tell the devs that we should close all raids until the Top 10 guilds clear them on heroic, so that they can feel superior to everyone else as they are seeing content that you, the raiders not-as-good-as-them aren't seeing. Does it make sense?<br />
<br />
Again you come back to a frankly stupid and absurd statement about locking content till the top 10 guilds kill it....I mean why do you have such a problem with players doing stuff that others cannot?<br />
Do you mean that the argument of locking &quot;casuals&quot; from LFR so that raiders can feel superior because they aren't doing that content is fine, but that same example applied in a higher level is wrong? Both situations are the same, just applied at a different scale.<br />
<br />
I don't have a problem with players doing stuff that others cannot, I have a problem with proclaiming that locking others so someone can feel superior is a good thing (and regardless, what I may have problems with is irrelevant to this discussion, is not me who decides what's wrong and what's not). <br />
<br />
Have you never looked at a player in full gear beyond your skill levels or content and thought wow I want to look like that someday.<br />
No, never. Back in the old days I remember looking at a T1 geared player, and my reaction was something along the lines of &quot;that armor is cool, I wonder how long it'll take me before getting to reach the place where I can get that&quot;. And the only reason that particular player caught my attention was because he was playing the same class than me.<br />
<br />
For a lot of people clearing things on a higher difficulty is not content.<br />
The developers consider the Normal-Heroic transition to be part of the raiding progression. Of course, it's your choice to decide if you want to go and deal with Heroic content or not. <br />
<br />
What most are advocating in this thread is not to remove content from casuals, it’s to ensure that their content lasts longer and that they will learn and become better from their gaming experience.<br />
I'm quite sure that the &quot;casuals&quot; can handle themselves in what they want and how they want it, and they don't need parenting from &quot;hardcore&quot; players. And what I mean is, the goal, probably, is having fun, right?<br />
<br />
If that's the goal, then it's probably best to worry about how you can have fun yourself, and point out the flaws there, point out what doesn't let you have fun, without factoring in what other players do. That's something we can send to the developers. But judging how others should have fun is certainly not going to get us anywhere.<br />
<br />
But parently by nerfing is different somehow?<br />
The debuff is a design decission made by the developers based on the data they have. In the other hand, the players that say how the game should be for others only have their opinion. And opinions are great, as long as you don't try to turn them into facts. <br />
<br />
Loads of people are trying here, including me, but somehow you seem hellbent on telling me that I play for gear, status and titles.<br />
That you're playing for gear, status and titles is not a bad thing (if that is your case), the issue comes from saying that the only way those things are worth it is preventing others from getting it. <br />
<br />
I'm not having fun by the highest tier of raiding being watered down. I'm telling you, since you are our relay to the devs and designers. Please take note of it, since your arguements are based on some kind of assumpion of pride, while it really isn't. In fact, that shows only your personal view of the matter. Take one step back and look at it more objectively.<br />
Hopefully the Cutting Edge FoS will give a reason to you and your guildmates (if they don't share that view with you) to go and tackle the content without any debuffs.<br />
<br />
We post because we care (I hope). Just look at how (relatively) civil this 200 page thread still is. People take it serious. Perhaps you should to. Think. Reread, and only then post.<br />
I take it seriously, otherwise I wouldn't be posting here anymore. Actually, from this thread we've gathered useful feedback, and questions, that were forwarded to the developers. <br />
<br />
One thing, just as an example, was that some players here pointed out they feel the Power of the Aspects kicked in too early for them. The developers are happy with the point in time at which it was introduced. The timing of each increment of the debuff is completely driven by data. When they see participation and progress declining across the board because of &quot;brick walls&quot; on some bosses, they introduce the nerf to encourage those players to come back and keep trying. And every time they've done it they've seen the participation in Dragon Soul increase exponentially in comparison to previous weeks.<br />
<br />
So, with that in mind, it might be an aswer you like or one you don't. But, it is an answer (along with others we've shared) that came due to threads like this (and, as you remarked, its mostly civil tone). (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/228883-we-consume-content-too-fast/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4879017939?page=209#4177))<br />
<br />
Tabard Reputation Rewards<br />
The point is some people like how their character looks, and gaining rep with x factions forces you to wear different tabards you might not like (if you choose to gain rep via dungeons).<br />
Just as an update, we're going to change the whole tabard system with MoP, so this shouldn't be an issue any longer.<br />
We're fixing this in Mists of Pandaria by removing the whole concept of tabards providing reputation bonuses.<br />
<br />
Of course we're still in beta and things can always change... (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/231341-transmogrify-tabards/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3961946763?page=1#9))<br />
<br />
Spells in PvE vs PvP<br />
I think some of you are making big assumptions about how the spell data work. I realize that the mechanics behind our data can quite obtuse, but you'll just have to trust me that having two sets of numbers is just more risk than one. It is a risk worth taking sometimes, but it is a risk. Set bonuses, talents, tooltips, basically everything that can modify a spell need to modify two spells instead. There are opportunities for bugs to creep in, and long term players know how many strange bugs or quirks show up in character spells already.<br />
<br />
(Armchair programmers at thIs point can argue how our data structure *should* be set up, but you'll also just have to trust me that it's probably a more complex problem than you give it credit for.)<br />
<br />
In any case, I'm also not convinced at all that even if we could easily manage two different sets of numbers that it would really solve the problem. I think sometimes in players' minds, they say &quot;Man, I just can't kill anyone in PvP. It is a truth universally acknowledged that my dude's PvP damage is too low, but Blizzard can't buff it because I do well in PvE.&quot; The shortcoming in that logic of course is that the truth is rarely universally acknowledged, and in the case of PvP there aren't even logs or target dummies to look at. In some cases your damage is just fine and it's not the game rules holding you back. In some cases you lost not because the deck was stacked against you, but because you got outplayed. <br />
<br />
I'm not saying there aren't PvP balance issues. There are and there may always be. But I also don't think players would suddenly become much more objective about their own personal skill just because we adjusted more numbers independently. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/231112-why-are-we-not-balanced-this-way/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6201231500?page=3#57))<br />

Class Changes Discussion<br />
I know it may come as a shock, but this forum is not our sole conduit though which to monitor player feedback. The twin strategies of &quot;shh, don't admit we're overpowered&quot; and &quot;shh, don't let them know we're happy&quot; are about as transparent as you would imagine. I would suggest leaving the psychological warfare at home and just be honest about how you feel (and as I said above, backing it up with evidence of some kind is vastly more helpful to us).<br />
<br />
We had just been discussing whether it would be better to warn players that some nerfs were coming and let them worry themselves to death, or to just make the changes and have players be surprised. Conveniently, this thread came along....

Pet Battle Blue Posts<br />
Weakened by Capture<br />
We have made a few adjustments to the both the weakened by capture pets and the overall XP curve. Details below!<br />
<br />
<br />
Catching any pet level 15 or under retains its current level. Catching a level 16-20 pet will lose 1 level. Catching a level 21-25 pet will lose 2 levels. We have dramatically reduced the XP required to level for pets after level 10.<br />

Healing Pets is Getting Old<br />
We have reduced the cool down to 10m in the next build. Don't forget you can get single use heals in the Sack of Pet Supplies from the Tamer dailies as an alternative to using the Stable Master or your Revive spell.

<br />
Northrend Tamer<br />
When can we expect this achievement to be fixed? as it stands right now, there are still no battle pets in Crystalsong Forest so this achievement is currently unobtainable. <br />

Microscopic crabs.<br />
Is there a specific reason as to why every wild crab that I run into is almost microscopic? I wouldn't mind capturing one, but I would at least like to see the pet that I'm using. <br />

<br />
Revive Battle Pets Exploit?<br />
This is a good thread, here are a few of our thoughts:<br />
<br />
Healing pets to full after every battle is not a change we are interested in making. We want to encourage players to not only win a battle, but to win by taking the least amount of damage or by using pet heals in a smart way. Attrition is a driving part of the gameplay and it won't be going away anytime soon. We do have tunable factors that we will continue to watch though. (Battle Recovery, Revive spell cooldown &amp; pet bandages)<br />
<br />
In regards to the Revive Pets spell, we have just reduced the cooldown to 10m for the next build. (Down from 15m) We will keep a close eye on the feedback and continue to monitor how often players are using the Stable Master to heal. The Stable Master should be a fallback, not a requirement. We know the pet bandages are a bit too sparse right now too, we are going to amp that up as well to help fill in the gaps.<br />
<br />
Finally, the cool-up's that we added to the heal spells (both the player and stable master) are to deal with exploit cases of players using multiple characters/accounts to avoid cooldowns. We used 3 minutes as a baseline since most players can fly to one in that amount of time from pretty much anywhere on a full speed mount.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the feedback, we are listening! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/231306-revive-battle-pets-exploit/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6080660118?page=3#49))<br />

I agree, I do think its pretty hilarious that if these gems were just had purple text but the same stats, most of the rage would be gone.

There are 3 more parts confirmed for later patches, so I'm guessing this gem isn't the end-all-be-all legendary. I think this is the first step in a quest line to an actual legendary. My theory (no evidence on this at all) is that ultimately those weapons will become BiS through legendary upgrades across the patches until they actually become individual legendary weapons, with all the cool procs that go along with that. Or at least I hope. Also, I agree that LFR content shouldn't be dropping parts of the legendary quest. Legendary items are supposed to represent work, dedication, a ton of luck, and skill (I'm not saying that they have lately, seeing the rogue daggers and staff on every other player in arenas), and I think AFKing out for a few minutes then getting part of a legendary is going against this philosophy. I would be fine, however, if just this part and the next part even are available to LFR and then the final one or two quests required normal/heroic, that way casuals can get their nice semi-legendaries and hardcores that want to spend hours farming for it can do that as well for a slightly better version.</div></div><hr />

Yeah we really need to know if you can either repeat the questline to get more gems, or get new ones some other way. Especially if we can use them in weapons from the next tiers. Its possible we will be upgrading the weapons with each tier which for me would not be cool since I play hunter, dont like guns, and it has mastery. Thank god for transmog.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For me, the legendary items were never about the item itself, it was about the process you went through to get it. Back in the day, Thunderfury and Sulfuras were epic themselves but their process was never epic. The Warglaives of Azzinoth was nothing but a mere drop off a boss. It was an insanely rare drop but a drop none-the-less. There was nothing truly &quot;legendary&quot; about obtaining it because if you did the raid enough times your group was bound to find one eventually.<br />
<br />
These legendaries were based off luck, not skill, and so the items themselves were more legendary than the actual process to get them.<br />
<br />
Wrath of the Lich King changed this. The legendary items were difficult and time-consuming to achieve. You would be hard-pressed to ever obtain one purely by doing pick-up groups and you had to go through some challenges before the item was given to you. There was not as much luck involved like the old ones, it was all about how much patience you had and if you could donate the time to actually obtain the item.<br />
<br />
Having a weapon is pretty awesome but legendary gems have the potential to be useful even past the tier they were obtained on. Dragonwrath was great but has been superseded by Dragon Soul weapons. This was inevitable, we knew it was going to happen. If it didn't happen in T13 it would've happened in Mists of Pandaria, just like every other legendary. But why take the time and effort to design a legendary that players will only ever use for a few months before replacing?</div></div><hr />

The gem is just the first tier of the legendary quests, and is (98% likely) unrepeatable.<br />

Not really, since you can get &quot;Sha touched&quot; weapons from LFR. Therefore, you would need the gems to go into those weapons too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, you can get the epic sha-touched weapons because otherwise LFR would be missing an entire tier of weapons.<br />
<br />
The weapons drop independently of the quest, and aren't needed to start it, or to do the first section (the part up to rewarding the gem).<br />
<br />
I.e. Lot's of people will have sha-touched weapons, including LFR geared people.<br />
Much fewer will have sha-touched weapons gemmed with crystal gems, or the legendary versions of the weapons.</div></div><hr />

I think one of the issues with this community is that people seem to have a need to feel superior. &quot;I have better gear then you and that makes me happy&quot;. Idiots.<br />

I for one would love to be able to step into LFR, to get to have fun raiding / see content and mechanics - to get some gear - do more damage. For the people who don't like it, stay away from it. Do what you enjoy and let the rest do that too. <br />

You're kinda taking it to the extreme, no one mentions locking raids out completely to the less-skilled players. I just personally don't like the idea that in a MMO people don't want to work for their reward. Instead of risk=reward, the game is turning into queue=reward, and I don't like that.

The whole premise of that forum post you're talking about is quite simply to make things too hard for 'casuals'.

Not every player has the same benefits as each other. Every player is of a different skill level and saying that keeping the raids hard will get casuals to put the time in to get better at the game is actually quite laughable. A 'casual' player is casual simply because they don't have that kind of time to put into a game. I know casual players that are still in the top guilds on my server. People have lives. Not everyone can sink 5+ hours into a game ever day. The majority of casual players will simply not raid at all if that difficulty is there. And I'm sorry but, if I was a developer and I'd put in all that content that we'll be seeing in MoP, I'd want every last person to have a solid chance of seeing what I made despite them not having loads of time to see it.<br />

Indeed, I just think it's a shame that a game is turning into less of a game and more into a queue and do nothing for a gold medal :/<br />

The fact that you can get better gear from LFR than from Dungeons, when dungeons are harder, is quite shocking.<br />

By the way, believe it or not, it doesn't take 5 hours to get to know your class :p in fact, if you ask around or look up noxxic you can learn a class in about 10 minutes depending on what class it is. But hey, my time with this game has finally come to an end, I'll be keeping an eye to see if they restore the game at all though :)</div></div><hr />

Hydraulic<br />
<br />
In this type of machine, hydraulic fluid is transmitted throughout the machine to various hydraulic motors and hydraulic cylinders and which becomes pressurised according to the resistance present. The fluid is controlled directly or automatically by control valves and distributed through hoses and tubes.<br />
<br />
So hopefully the gem can be taken out and back in using some Hydraulic power. But also for lets says blue or purple gems.</div></div><hr />

Indeed, I just think it's a shame that a game is turning into less of a game and more into a queue and do nothing for a gold medal :/<br />

As I said, it's your opinion. All opinions matter, no matter how daft they are (not saying yours is).<br />
<br />
LFR is meant to give better gear because, actually, it IS harder. People keep saying you can just AFK through the whole thing but that's just not true. If everyone sat there AFK while on Ultraxion, would the boss be killed? No, you'd wipe and have to do it properly. And to be honest, if something like that actually shocks you, life must be like the ultimate horror film for you.<br />
<br />
I never said anything about not knowing a class or needing 5 hours or more to learn it. I find it quite amusing that you point me towards a website to learn my class. Believe this or not, I actually manage to learn my class all on my own. Thinking for myself? Is that shocking too?<br />
<br />
By all means keep looking at how the game is doing. But please, don't just stick around to bad mouth the game if you no longer even play it. Millions of people still do and most have no idea this website even exists. Why? Because they manage to just play the game and have fun.<br />

I think Chaud already commented that the tooltip was wrong and that it should be a Sha-touched socket.</div></div><hr />

(or 25 etc) or is it something that will have to be allocated?<br />
<br />
As to other points I think the gem is just a stop gap, although if its not possible to remove the gem I can see it sitting in banks until the last teir, and by completing the expansion spanning chain you will get a legendary. Odd how there is a legendary shield icon and no sha touched shield. Oh and the lack of a non-agi tank friendly gem is a bit rubbish.<br />
<br />
As to devaluing heroic raiding, I personally do not think most heroic raiders will be bothered by who else has the legendary. Those that I know do it for a personal challenge or the realm/world race depending on how their guild stands. A lot of guilds on my server have now downed madness hc - and congrats to them but if you ask who are the best raiders on the server you will get the top 2-3 guilds listed (In fact probably the consistantly top guild although 2 and 3 get a lot of respect). My guild hasn't, why because as a whole we aren't bothered by heroics (and we do have a few member that used to be very competitive hc raiders) as its not why we raid. We could go back and do it know with the 30% debuff but that doesn't appeal. Our remaining plan for pre-mists is to go do Sinestra as we never saw her, not because that will make us amazing raiders (we hideously outgear it). My point is it doesn't really matter someone getting something on easy mode or when they hideous outgear it is not a challenge to the skill it takes to be in the top x, but by giving everyone that access you may just inspire people to step up and that can only mean more raiders. And rant off.<br />
<br />
As for the rep tabards, glad they are gone - completely detached mechanic I would rather return to having 1-2 dungeons to grind for relevant factional rep. There are definately advantages to having the reps and I will want them all, but I am glad the I must hammer heroics in different tabards until I am exalted with all is gone. I intend to do heroics til I have all gear and then maybe poke at challenge modes - so glad I am not looking at having to grind the same ones repeatedly for the bulk of an expansion.</div></div><hr />

I think you are taking my post as a personal attack, I was not directing you towards noxxic, please don't be dramatic. I was saying that there are so many resources that can help people become better at the game in only 10 minutes that there really isn't an excuse, and could I ask if you have actually played LFR? I say it's a shock because every time I have been in there to help someone else out I see multiple people auto attacking or simply not attacking at all. Needless to say the few people who do actually take part in the fight manage to take down the bosses, even if there is only 15 or so people attacking or healing. Don't say LFR is harder than dungeons, because that is not true at all. The most challenging part of it for players is the button boss, because buttons are hard, clearly.<br />
<br />
I am not bad mouthing the game, this just backs up the idea that you're taking this as an insult and not as criticism, the current state of the game is bad, take a look at the damn dungeon and raid forums, or even the thread the blues are talking in, so many people are against the current state of the game and are stuck in annual passes or subscriptions.<br />
<br />
Again, please don't take this as a personal insult because it's not, and I'm all for a good discussion but every discussion which is opinionated seems to turn into a personal attack.<br />
<br />
Again, to be 100%, I'm not attacking you.<br />
<br />
This post is not a personal attack on you.<br />
<br />
Edit: also i'll add that you did suggest that the game does take 5 hours to learn, if people take 10 minutes to learn their class and add a bit of difficulty to LFR like every other game, it wouldn't take 5 hours:<br />
<br />
Not everyone can sink 5+ hours into a game ever day. The majority of casual players will simply not raid at all if that difficulty is there.</div></div><hr />

First of all, no, I didn't take anything as a personal attack. I'm grown up enough to not be offended by someone on the internet.<br />
<br />
As for websites and addons, a lot of new players have no idea that those things are out there. A lot of current players don't even know about some of them. Unless a current player directs these guys to those resources, then they will only learn as well as their brains allow them.<br />
I've done LFR plenty of times and probably 9/10 times, everyone is doing as they should be. Generally because they don't want to be kicked. You can't take a few examples of your experience and assume it's the exact same experience for everyone else. In the end, your experience with the game will likely differ greatly from my own meaning that we have (obviously) different opinions of things. I won't deny that pushing a button seems hard for some people though. A druid in my raid group always fails to press it when he needs to, no matter how many times we tell him :P<br />
<br />
Again, I'm not insulted so easily :) The current state of the game is not good or bad. It is subjective. Please don't tell me to read the forums. They are pretty much only used by people who have nothing better to do than complain. I've been raiding for a looong time and I would much rather have things the way we do now than what we used to have. Everything is opinion though and with so many players, there are bound to be so many different ones.</div></div><hr />

Greater reward for doing something that takes more effort? what an interesting concept. Oddly this the very thing they argue against when defending nerfs (or at least that blue clown does). Shows that their arguement is flawed.</div></div><hr />

30%+ of the games subscriptions gone since Wrath (not including those who have left and been replaced by new subscribers or RAF/SoR) says the game is in a decline :p It will be interesting though to see the numbers in Q42012/Q12013, when the &quot;new expansion&quot; view has disappeared, and the 1.1million annual pass holders who want to break away have unsubscribed.<br />
<br />
Really, I hope Blizzard takes the loss in subscriptions as a wake up call to produce better content than the 4.1 Zul dungeons (Replacing a new raid with a couple of rehashed dungeons, yay?) and the 7-boss Firelands raid, and the 8-boss DS raid which had unusual difficulty curves all over the place, but we'll find out when 5.1 hits PTR.

I don't think 30% is exactly correct. That would mean each 30% = 3 million people. Considering we had 12 million to start with, that would mean 120% + :confused:<br />

I do agree that I'd rather not have a repeat of 4.1, though I enjoyed the dungeons. What I have seen of the beta and played on the beta, MoP looks like a solid expansion so far. But yes, 5.1 will likely be what to look out for. Honestly, I think the the lack of things in Cata is a result of them wanting to make MoP all it can be at launch.</div></div><hr />

Secondly is my questions, Is the gem going to get removable along with possible future enchants to reuse on new/better weapons as the expac continues or are players expected to save everything untill they get end game BiS? and is there only going to be one player in the raid at a time going to be able to collect the items? if i so i think this may cause alot of aggro for some players.<br />

Maybe we won't get enough sigils before heroic is actually released, considering the gating on the raids and if sigil's of wisdom only drops from Heart of Fear and Terrace of Endless Springs... Then it could take a while before anyone has enough to even get the gem.<br />

Plate tanks have a higher strentgh to parry conversion ratio than they did in cata and parry gained from strength is not subject to DR if I remember correctly. The gem's are not quite as bad as they would be on live. Still not great but hardly worthless.</div></div><hr />

That is a stupid statement. If you're a raider that seeks progression, you HAVE to do LFR and try get the tier out of it. That's what my guild a couple of months of DS and it was horrible, we got as many guildies as possible to gear to push heroic modes faster. <br />

I am not bad mouthing the game, this just backs up the idea that you're taking this as an insult and not as criticism, the current state of the game is bad, take a look at the damn dungeon and raid forums, or even the thread the blues are talking in, so many people are against the current state of the game and are stuck in annual passes or subscriptions.<br />
<br />
Again, please don't take this as a personal insult because it's not, and I'm all for a good discussion but every discussion which is opinionated seems to turn into a personal attack.<br />
<br />
Again, to be 100%, I'm not attacking you.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This post is not a personal attack on you.<br />
<br />
Edit: also i'll add that you did suggest that the game does take 5 hours to learn, if people take 10 minutes to learn their class and add a bit of difficulty to LFR like every other game, it wouldn't take 5 hours:<br />
<br />
<br />
LFR is harder than earning 2200 in 3s or RBGs?<br />
<br />
Ok.<br />
<br />
By the way the LFR version of the 2h axe has 250 more str than the TIER TWO 2h Malevolent axe.</div></div><hr />

Guess what.<br />
<br />
LFR is optional - don't like it, don't do it.<br />
<br />
Guess what.<br />
<br />
Gemming and enchanting is optional - want harder content, don't do it.<br />
<br />
Oh wait! If you want to be competitive you have to gem, enchant and do LFR for every possible chance at upgrades to be the best you possibly can for your raiding guild! Ooooooh!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrile</div><div class="date">2012-08-04, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;While LFR difficulty requires less coordination and organization than normal raids, it still generally takes more effort than completing a heroic. Therefore, shouldn't the rewards be greater?&quot;<br />
<br />
Greater reward for doing something that takes more effort? what an interesting concept. Oddly this the very thing they argue against when defending nerfs (or at least that blue clown does). Shows that their arguement is flawed.<br />
<br />
And you need to think a few minutes. it is about timing. On Dec 18 (or any other day), LFR is more difficult than a heroic dungeon on the same day. thus you get better rewards. On Dec 18, YOU are being rewarded with higher iLevel gear for completing the heroic raid than someone who on that same day cant´complete that content. You are receiving a greater reward than someone for doing the harder content. That is a good system.<br />
<br />
It is fairly obvious that the people like yourself arguing against him cannot think past your snowflake syndrome. His comments were very easily understood and made sense, but as usual, people either can´t understand, or intentionally try to twist them. From most of the posts, my guess is you just don´t understand.</div></div><hr />

If you're a raider that seeks progression, you HAVE to do LFR and try get the tier out of it. That's what my guild a couple of months of DS and it was horrible, we got as many guildies as possible to gear to push heroic modes faster. <br />
<br />
The loot system maybe changing, but it will still be advantageous to bring as many guildies as possible to up the chances of someone in the guild getting loot over a pug.<br />
<br />
Nobody is &quot;forcing&quot; you to do anything.<br />
<br />
You choose to run LFR but, if you don't, big deal - it takes you a little longer to get to the end. <br />
<br />
Basically you're complaining about being &quot;forced&quot; to run LFR and then you complain about not having anything to do when you rush through content. /boggle</div></div><hr />

Aesthetics plays a HUGE role in any MMO. I've been playing for god knows how long, and I've seen people leave in Vanilla because they were tired of resembling a sickly looking rainbow. <br />

My point with the post is that Blizzard is clearly performing the ole' &quot;Bait and Switch&quot; where they show you some sweet-ass looking gear on the character creation, then when you login you're actually wearing some lame-ass gear. Thereby forcing you into wanting to level, so you can look just like you did on the character creation screen.</div></div><hr />

Alternatively it's so that raiders don't burn out as fast on LFR content for gear (Yes, 1 entire week of not being burnt out). Delaying LFR for 1 week hardly fixes any problem on either side, in fact it only creates the problem of the casual players not seeing content as fast.

<br />
30% of the 12 million circa the beginning of Cata is approx 3.6 million meaning we are not at the 30% reduction yet, that will be at 8.4 million-ish, but the exact percentage is irrelevant - the causes are more relevant, from those I have spoken too that was the lack of content through out cata, anecdotal admitted but far more common that any other reason I have heard. Am I suprised that the number dropped 1.1 million last quarter, not at all given looking at the 2 servers I play regularly the number of guilds progressing is massively lower than the number that were progressing 2 months prior to cata release. Blizzard really needed to hit the may-july window with Mists, they didn't this a consequence. Plus its an old game, if star wars can survive on 500k then WOW is doing fine on 9.1M.<br />
<br />
Which is why blizzard seem to be doing the right thing and ensuring everyone has a lot of content they can access, if that leads to a few losses due to &quot;I am no longer a special flower&quot; they can probably eat that over a massive drop due to lack of content. Ultimately they are never going to please all subscribers, let alone vocal forum posters and if someone at blizzard gets it wrong then they are probably going to suffer the consequences to their career.<br />
<br />
Some annual pass holders will unsub, but if they are no longer bother about wow and don't play or are willing to buy D3 there is nothing stopping them from doing it now. I am an annual pass holder, I have remained subbed largely to keep in contact with guild etc, will I be cancelling - no as mists will be out before my annual pass runs out and from the beta is likely to hold my attention. I imagine that is the same for a lot of players.<br />

As it seems, those gems are Unique-Equipped, so it would make the other weapon less effective. And so, when we actually get the legendary WEAPON, will it work on both or would we have to farm another one it the original gem is consumed upon the process.</div></div><hr />

Hydraulic<br />
<br />
In this type of machine, hydraulic fluid is transmitted throughout the machine to various hydraulic motors and hydraulic cylinders and which becomes pressurised according to the resistance present. The fluid is controlled directly or automatically by control valves and distributed through hoses and tubes.<br />
<br />
So hopefully the gem can be taken out and back in using some Hydraulic power. But also for lets says blue or purple gems.<br />
<br />
It is a Sha-Touched socket, our tooltips are wrong. They will be correct sometime next week. <br />
<br />
<br />
So then how is it decided who get's the legendary?<br />
Or at least starts this gem quest?<br />
Can anyone just pick up the quest and be able to loot the sigils from the bosses? Or what if multiple people have the quest? Does only one get the sigil?<br />
Oh the questions left unanswered!<br />
<br />
Anyone can start the quest.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok quick question, as I have not seen this confirmed, if all 10 of your raid group are on the quest do all 10 get to loot the quest items? (or 25 etc) or is it something that will have to be allocated?<br />
<br />
<br />
Everyone gets it in LFR.<br />

Cheers Chaud, I guess it would be the same with normals/heroic or that would be very odd. Personal legendary chains I think will work out better for the community as a whole, saves potential guild issues, although I do hope they don't become seen as mandatory given the rep grind aspect that seems to be involved as that would upset some.</div></div><hr />

The thing is - the game was originally built on the idea of what people call &quot;Special flower/snowflake&quot; or whatever, this is a freakin mmo, you're supposed to work your way up in the game, not just get handed everything as soon as you hit level 90. But y'kno what? That's fine. If Blizzard wants to make all content open and killable within the first week, that's cool. But they MUST release more content to keep up with the large amount of people who finish content that fast. They can't just make a smaller amount of content (12 bosses down to 7 bosses) and keep the amount of development time to the standard 5-10 months.<br />
<br />
Blizzard wants to make the game easy for everyone? Fine. Release more content at a faster pace to keep up with the players who see it as a [now] boring grind.<br />
Blizzard wants to make the game harder? Content will last a lot longer and they can keep the long development times.<br />
Blizzard wants to make the game easier, but keep the 5-10 month development times? You're putting a knife to your own games neck, Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

What balance? Let the Raiders have their Normal Raid and let the Casuals have their LFR at the same time. I don't see what the big issue is with releasing them at the same time.

It partly is a problem, if you want to be the best possible raider for your guild you'd take every possibly opportunity to get the best gear, enchants, rotation and gems you possibly can. If LFR was linked to the 10+25 Normal and Heroic lockout, things would be fine, because the casual players would be fine doing LFR, and the normal raiders wont be able to do LFR.</div></div><hr />

I loved EARLY Wrath Raiding, due to the fact that I could Raid both 10 and 25 Man content. Every Tuesday, my guild and I would clear 25Man Naxxramas/3D Obsidium Sanctum and Eye of Eternity. Then every Thursday and Friday, we'd split up into 3 groups of 10 (filling in the raid slots with friend-status guildies) and do the same thing with 10mans. Mondays we'd have our &quot;Alt Naxxramas run&quot; where we'd logon our Alts and clear 25Man Naxxramas again. We all did this clear until ICC, then we focused on Meta Achieves for Uld/Icc for Drakes. We loved every minute of it.<br />
<br />
Side note: I'm not intending on sounding argumentative at all. If it seems I am, my bad bro.<br />
<br />
Side note 2: I have no other side note.<br />
--Edit: I actually do. When Blizzard created the shared lockout system, it literally broke up tons of alt runs that we did in 10Man ICC. On Tuesdays and Wednesdays we'd have ICC25 cleared and on Fridays/Saturdays I would run 10man with Friends or alts. When they made the shared lockout system, all that went to shit.</div></div><hr />

I agree. I have always thought that LFR was toxic, but I have friends that can only really do that because they don't pay too much mind to squeezing out potential out of their characters and stuff. However, I do remember the same friends in Wrath and they made due by raiding in like minded guilds and such.<br />

Mondays we'd have our &quot;Alt Naxxramas run&quot; where we'd logon our Alts and clear 25Man Naxxramas again. We all did this clear until ICC, then we focused on Meta Achieves for Uld/Icc for Drakes. We loved every minute of it.<br />
<br />
Side note: I'm not intending on sounding argumentative at all. If it seems I am, my bad bro.<br />
<br />
Side note 2: I have no other side note.<br />
--Edit: I actually do. When Blizzard created the shared lockout system, it literally broke up tons of alt runs that we did in 10Man ICC. On Tuesdays and Wednesdays we'd have ICC25 cleared and on Fridays/Saturdays I would run 10man with Friends or alts. When they made the shared lockout system, all that went to shit.<br />
<br />
I think that might be more because the fights honestly felt like boss fights, naxxramas was a huge place with different interesting sections and bosses. When you play through Dragon soul or firelands it feels like you're on a single storyline, which you are.<br />
<br />
Personally, I wish they made raids as big as naxxramas, buff the difficulty in it and create a gated version of LFR in which you, for example, unlock a boss or two each week. (There is no wiping on LFR, assuming this continues you might aswell emulate the feeling of progressing through the raid each week to bash out a new bad guy rather than unlock it all in 2 weeks which just ends up removing any satisfaction of defeating a boss)<br />
<br />
If they did the above and continued to spend 5-6 months on content, I would be okay with that! As long as the content lasts in all difficulties<br />
<br />
There are so many things to talk about which I feel blizzard have done completely wrong which is why my ideas may seem uneasy to follow, i apologise, one day i'll combine everything into a post explaining my feelings im sure! My one on the official forums was deleted and I was banned for using the term &quot;bugger&quot;<br />

That said, it is really heartening to see that people are speaking out against LFR after seeing it in Cata.<br />

<br />
So you're going to play the game to stay the same level otherwise? I don't get what your beef with this is. You say that aesthetics are important but are complaining about the ability to see what your future toon will look like in higher level gear. If you really are that focused on aesthetics then you think this is something that you would want to know.</div></div><hr />

If others want to try and burn the content in two weeks through LFR. How is your gaming experience diminished by it? I can't honestly understand what's the big deal on people that isn't you doing something that you don't want to do. I mean, what could you possibly do when someone that is not you storms Mogu'shan Vaults on the LFR...<br />
<br />
it also allows raiders to feel somewhat superior as they are seeing content others arent<br />
Perhaps we should just tell the devs that we should close all raids until the Top 10 guilds clear them on heroic, so that they can feel superior to everyone else as they are seeing content that you, the raiders not-as-good-as-them aren't seeing. Does it make sense?&quot;<br />

Alternatively they know posting on the forums gets them no-where, just like what happened when previous &quot;Hardcore&quot; raiders and gladiators have posted about what they dislike about the game. The posts usually get a load of likes but they're completely ignored by the blues. In this case the blues are actually responding in ways which don't quite make sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
SAME! I hate this- I hate how they want us to use this system that they've worked so hard on- yet they restrict us (as in this example- where they tell us one thing, and then update it and change their minds). Why not allow us to do the quests in LFR but perhaps require more gems, like 20 or 30 compared to the original 10.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Volcker</div><div class="date">2012-08-05, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Given that they introduced a 25-point achievement for completing Part I of the quest, my initial thinking was that they would make it so that the quest is able to be completed by a large percentage of the population (whether through letting the items drop in LFR, and/or by making the items drop for everyone in normal/heroic). If the drops are restricted to normal AND only one Sigil of Wisdom drops per week, only a very few people are going to get the achievement (not to mention being able to continue the quests for the three remaining 25-point achievements).<br />
<br />
I have no problem with making legendaries restrictive, but if that's the case, I think the achievement should be changed to a feat of strength as with all of the other achievements involving legendaries.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lynix</div><div class="date">2012-08-05, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For a lot of people clearing things on a higher difficulty is not content.<br />
The developers consider the Normal-Heroic transition to be part of the raiding progression. Of course, it's your choice to decide if you want to go and deal with Heroic content or not. <br />
<br />
And it's why I'm not playing and many others are quitting. There are serious problems when a company can't see their own flaws. I'm not phased by difficulty levels in dungeons but I think they are missing the point. Raid difficulty should be a choice on a guilds part rather then a path of progression. All difficulties should the same gear but the dungeon should be harder. Each difficulty should award different amounts of currency per kill. All 3 difficulties should take the same gear to beat, but higher difficulty should require more skill and awareness.<br />
<br />
A good example of how progress would work this way below. 1 being easy 100 being hard.<br />
<br />
LFR patch teir 1 raid - difficulty 15/100 - currency per boss kill: 5 <br />
Normal patch 1 teir 1 raid - Difficulty 55/100 - Currency per boss kill: 15 <br />
Heroic patch 1 teir 1 raid - Difficulty 70-80/100 - Currency per boss kill: 25 &lt;--- This difficulty never gets nerfed, It should be for hardcore players and nerfs should only occur on broken mechanics<br />
<br />
LFR patch 1 teir 2 raid - difficulty 25-30/100 - currency per boss kill: 10<br />
Normal patch 1 teir 2 raid - Difficulty 60-70/100 - Currency per boss kill: 25<br />
Heroic patch 1 teir 2 raid - Difficulty 90 - 100/100 - Currency per boss kill: 40<br />
<br />
LFR patch 1 teir 3 raid - difficulty 35/100 - currency per boss kill: 10<br />
Normal patch 1 teir 3 raid - Difficulty 70-80/100 - Currency per boss kill: 30<br />
Heroic patch 1 teir 3 raid - Difficulty 100-130/100 - Currency per boss kill: 50 &lt;-- over 100 = extreme bosses that you should wipe on for literally weeks maybe months<br />
<br />
in this setup hardcore raiders can get the challenge they want because blizzard is counting on people to use heroic difficulty for progression. <br />
<br />
NOTE THAT IN THIS SETUP YOU WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO ENTER A HEROIC RAID WITH ANY LFR OR NORMAL GEAR ON. the idea is to make heroics, heroic and as such you will need to progress properly through them. This means that useless players wont be able to kill the content on heroic, just because they are geared from normal.<br />
<br />
EVERYONE WINS! hardcores are happy they can brag, they are still rewarded for greater effort and casuals can still feel like they are progressing through the story.</div></div><hr />

They will, blizzard will keep making everything ingame accessible to everyone. Why take away something that the majority of raiders do now which is LFR.<br />
<br />
It's great that we don't need to be in a raiding guild anymore to get what raiders get and see all the content, makes for a much better game and hopefully one day raiding guilds will be a thing of the past and the game with just a lfr mode.</div></div><hr />
