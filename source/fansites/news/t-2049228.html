Invasion Armor - Warforged Hotfix<br />
The item level 700 armor rewarded from the Legion invasions was hotfixed to have a chance to be Warforged. If you are looking for another reason to do invasions, keep in mind that XP gains were recently buffed (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/764457048931053569). <br />

Legion - Pre-Expansion Event Changes<br />
The Legion's invasions will intensify this week and part of the pre-expansion quest line will unlock! <br />

<br />
Shadow Dance and the Stealth Bar<br />
We’ve been reading all of the feedback throughout beta regarding Shadow Dance and the desire to have it use the “Stealth action bar.” To get right to the point, after an upcoming hotfix, Subtlety Rogues will find that Shadow Dance swaps their main action bar to the alternate bar that is used while in Stealth.<br />
<br />
For a bit of context on the late change to our thinking on this: we rarely allow automatic functionality (such as action bar swaps, or macros) to choose between core damage abilities on the player’s behalf. We believe it’s important that the player has to make those choices themselves. The Rogue Stealth bar has always been a minor exception to this, but for many years, the Stealth bar was only active for the single ability you used to open a combat, and was not seen again for the duration of combat (other than with Vanish). The ability to bind your openers to the same buttons as your rotational abilities was a convenience that didn’t affect your use of abilities in combat.<br />
<br />
However, the new Shadow Dance (and to a lesser extent Subterfuge), has resulted in some Rogues regularly using openers during combat, as elements of their rotation. In this case, the Stealth bar changes from a minor convenience that lets you place once-per-combat buttons on more convenient keybinds, to actually making regular, mid-combat decisions for you.<br />
<br />
That said, after following the ongoing discussions and carefully considering your feedback, we understand the desire for consistency with other abilities that allow Stealth-only actions. Given the gray area that Shadow Dance is in, and the widespread feedback that using the Stealth bar would be more consistent and intuitive, we’ve decided to go ahead and allow Shadow Dance to once again swap your main action bar. This hotfix is scheduled to live with weekly restarts in each region.<br />
<br />
A few details for players who use macros to further manage their buttons:<br />
<br />
Shadow Dance will be treated similarly to Subterfuge for the purposes of macro conditionals. It will not activate [stealth], but it will activate [stance:2]. If you want to make a macro that mimics the behavior of the main bar (i.e. swapping when you have any of Stealth, Vanish, Subterfuge, or Shadow Dance), you can use the macro conditional .<br />

High King Title<br />
Just for some lore notes on the title itself...<br />
<br />
The title &quot;High King&quot; is more akin to the title &quot;Supreme Commander&quot; that was held by Anduin Lothar, being the commander of the Grand Alliance's armed forces. It doesn't serve to denote &quot;rule&quot;, &quot;legal authority&quot;, or any kind of faction-wide political control over the civilians of the races that make up the Alliance itself (outside of the case where Varian was the High King of the Alliance, and the King of Stormwind, making him the leader of the humans of Stormwind, obviously).<br />
<br />
We've discussed this a lot in the past, but the title and position of &quot;High King&quot; fits thematically with the Alliance - being an alliance formed originally around allegiances to human kingdoms.<br />
<br />
Much like the Warchief of the Horde serving a military role, the High King acts to try to coordinate the forces that he is given leave to command (races of the Alliance can refuse to commit forces to the High King). This does not necessarily mean that the entire group agrees with the High King at all times, but they do recognize and understand the need for organized military intervention.<br />
<br />
You may suggest that the humans should not have the title of High King, but as said above, there is a historical anchor within the Human Kingdoms for commanding the militaries of the Alliance, and they do believe they are better served by these Kingdoms than they would be by a Republic or Democracy.<br />
<br />
A note on the name back to you. You guys decided to call it the &quot;High King,&quot; in an Alliance of races where only two of the seven factions have a monarchy, while completely disregarding the much more descriptive and accurate term &quot;Supreme Commander.&quot; And then you had the Human King get the title. The message is pretty clear.<br />
I don't personally think there is anything stopping the Alliance from choosing a member of another race as their commander, but it seems to me that, thematically, High King has been fitting of the title for some time. As said, the Alliance was founded as a collection of Human Kingdom, and there is historical weight there for the title of &quot;King&quot;. Nothing stops titles from being changed, though.<br />
<br />
It is also important to note that the human's relative military strength compared to other members of the Alliance is much larger - especially that of Stormwind - which does give them some precedence in being appointed leader of the larger Alliance military.<br />
<br />
Let me see if I can get some answers on the &quot;Why Anduin?&quot; question. (Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20748655328?page=3#52))<br />

[b]Pre-Expansion Events<br />
XP from invasions increased dramatically, should now be a good way to level alts? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/764457048931053569))<br />
But now I'm getting a heap of XP for completing it. <br />
Correct, the XP bump was on stage completion, not dudes you kill (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/764462844431572994))<br />
<br />
.Will the Charred Locket item still be both BoE and able to be returned to its owner after 8/30?<br />
yes (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/764291690484015104))<br />
<br />
Are the Karazhan quests limited time pre-launch exclusives, or are they here to stay in Legion?<br />
you can do them at any time after 8/30 by visiting Archivist Elysiana in Dalaran (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/764291829504147456))<br />

PvP<br />
The relic effects don't work but their Item Level Does aka some people 850 wep others 750 big difference.<br />
not really that big of a difference. Average item level all that matters. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/764315485395574786))<br />
true but their average ilvl goes up quite a bit and ends up being pretty significant<br />
will dbl check but if only difference is 850 wpn, avg ilvl will go up 3 points so 0.3% stats. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/764343748734038016))<br />

Everyone has opinions, and it is good that they differ. <br />
<br />
To me this is the best launch/pre-expansion event to have ever been put in WoW. <br />
The amount of details and passion they have put into what is merely the introduction of the next expansion is very cool.<br />
Plenty of stuff to do too: scenario on the Broken Shore (different twist depending on your faction), the activity in the world with the constant Legion Invasions, the stunning cinematics, the quests and events that are still to come in the next weeks as we build up to the actual launch, ...<br />
<br />
The rewards from these events feel rewarding and fitting to get everyone ready for what's to come next. Same thing with the Experience rewards, people can catch-up if they decide they want to switch mains.<br />
A true call to arms, which has gotten me and many of my friends and guildies excited for what is going to come next: preparing for an all out war against the Legion on the Broken Shore.<br />
<br />
Why do you feel this event is boring? Which previous pre-launch event did you like better?</div></div><hr />

Can confirm that the loot is generated when opening these crates, not when you receive them.</div></div><hr />

The TBC one was a combination of cool and lame. There was a quest at the Dark Portal to kill 6 Felguards and a world boss that spawned with his minions which was pretty much a smaller version of this. The patch events for AQ and Naxx was far more impressive but I actually enjoyed standing in front of the portal to defend Azeroth. I'd have to agree with you that this likely is the best event, maybe losing out to the madness that was WotLK.</div></div><hr />

Let's not forget that these events didn't have all their features from the start, they were done progressively. People who complain at this events were either not here during WoD and MoP event or are just not very bright. Probably the latter.</div></div><hr />

You had the mini Naxxes spawning all over EPL and swarms of undead coming out of it and could get amazing gear that increased damage vs undead. In addition there was the ability to become undead and infect others.<br />
<br />
This event feels similar, but is gated behind long wait time periods and is over very fast - sitting around waiting kills it. TBC felt more like stopping an invasion through the portal to me, where this seems more like a poorly done copy of Rifts. Still beats Cata, MoP and WoD.</div></div><hr />

The complaints about WotLK and Cata were they couldn't do their non-invasion stuff.<br />
I know someone who flipped their shit because they couldn't access the AH at the time. He was ANGRY.<br />
He can't handle anything interrupting his routines or he goes batshit nuts.<br />
He thinks he's over his anger issues -- he is not. Far from it.</div></div><hr />

To be fair, the Demon Invasion stuff is making some other activities tougher, though they're less of a thing than WotLK and Cata. My wife plays Alliance and she's working on grinding up Alliance reps for the sake of getting the basic mounts for other races and the Demon Invasions in Westfall made grinding Stormwind a bigger pain than it needed to be.</div></div><hr />

If she just stand there in westfall until the event is over, she'll be able to play again normally, will get the box rewards and won't be bothered by it again for quite some time. The events are phased.</div></div><hr />

Only half of it and they said the half that remained would remain. You cannot get Iron Starlette anymore, but they left the mobs to allow the whelp to be found.<br />

Yep now its giving the same as a single quest, just not worth leveling any alts with invasions at this point, you can already see the number of people doing them declining considerable, no wonder if there is zero incentive now.<br />

Tbh its just more in the way of normal zone leveling/questing because of the phasing.</div></div><hr />

Neltharion is also confused by this tweet. He even tries to say in a later tweet that while xp from one invasion is nerfed, if you do all 3 (now that there's an additional invasion) you'll still end up with a better xp/hr. How can this be true when just yesterday from one invasion I saw a puny Gnome get more exp in one invasion than he did doing all three today?<br />
<br />
Not to mention I'm not giving free rides to these invasions. Lower level players may only be able to make it to one or two invasions tops. Because they can't fly like me.<br />

<br />
Oh dont give me that. You know full well that this is an event designed to cover multiple weeks with different things.<br />
First we get the Broken Shore, which in terms of scenarios is head and shoulders above in quality, pacing and story than Theramore. <br />
We also get the invasions, which are better in design than the TBC demon stuff and the elemental invasions. <br />
Then theres the Dark Whisper stuff in SW and Org.<br />
<br />
Starting this week we get the next phase which has quest lines that further set up the story for Legion and take us to various places in the world. <br />
And Demon hunters to top it off for pre-orders.<br />
<br />
There is no doubt that this is the most extensive, multifaceted, story progressive pre launch event we have had yet. You may have fond memories of the plague event, or standing in font of the portal killing demons for a tabard, but dont act like this event doesnt give players a good reason to be happy with it.</div></div><hr />

no class/spec shall be made playable when macros become a must. macros are there to help you, not a requirement<br />
<br />
much like spell reflect. swapping from 2h to 1h+shield back and forth cannot be done without macros. and it took them all these time to change it.<br />
<br />
dont understand why people are so happy with this &quot;fix&quot;? its just what it was. requires me to make a macro for every single one of my spells on the stealth bar. <br />
cheapshot/ambush, ambush/evis<br />
<br />
but what if i want to use cheap shot during shadowdance? huh, it gets more complicated if you need all the tools<br />
maybe i just havent found the best maros? which in the first place i shouldnt need to learn to code in order to play my class/spec</div></div><hr />
