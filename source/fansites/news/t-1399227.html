Patch 5.4.2 - Karazhan Cleanup<br />
You might have noticed the addition of a new phase, &quot;Karazhan Restoration&quot; in the latest PTR build (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3559-Patch-5-4-2-PTR-Build-17585). It is unclear what that phase will be used for, but the regular version of Karazhan has seen some cleanup in 5.4.2. Most of the spiderwebs, skeletons, and overturned chairs have been removed. All other signs of abandonment and age remain untouched.<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Warlords of Draenor Beta<br />
Yes, No or IDK interview question time! Will we see WoD Beta before the end of February?<br />
IDK (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400804590674657280))<br />
<br />
Warlords' preview looked great but pretty raw compared to how polished everything was for the Pandaria announcement.<br />
That's odd. Feels like we are farther along for WoD than we were for MoP. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400803652366893056))<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
Will tank dps be looked at for WoD, It's just not right that they are top on so many encounters. They should NEVER be<br />
We are planning on changing Vengeance to only affect defenses and just making tank abilities hit harder. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/401044593958854656))<br />
That should let tank DPS be relevant, without it being absurd. They may still win meters on big AE fights. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/401044728927354882))<br />
<br />
DoT snapshotting existed before MoP and it's a skill differentiator. The balance issue is Pandemic.<br />
The real issue is temp stat boosts. We just can't do them in class CDs, trinkets etc. when snapshotting is so prominent (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/401036505897914368))<br />
<br />
Spirit won't matter as long as you have varied regen mechanics, mindbender vs innervate? rofl. 600kmana/9min vs 180k/9min...<br />
You can't compare spells in a vacuum. Who runs out of mana first, the Holy priest or Resto druid? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400805202107699200))<br />

Hey.. speaking of the new character models.. will druid forms get some love aswell?<br />
I doubt it. They were redone fairly recently in the grand scheme of things. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400807820733321217))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/271-Hunter) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/hunter) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#M))<br />
You say you want hunters to fill the role of mobile ranged, then give us Snipe. I don't get it. (1of2)<br />
The intent is someone who is willing to deal with the challenge of non 100% movement can perhaps benefit from DPS. It's optional. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400806955393884160))<br />
<br />

Will fire mages get a revamp in 6.0? You remarked before they need work but was not essential in 5.4.<br />
in what way do you think that combustion is hard to understand?<br />
It's not hard to understand per se it's the insane decision tree that Combustion + Alter Time creates &amp; the penalty for failing (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400812351617638400))<br />
<br />

Is slice and dice deleted for Warlords of draenor (for sub and combat)?<br />
Not at the moment. We just want to distinguish rotations a bit more by not having all rogues have to manage it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/401043581600677888))<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor Flying<br />
I was wondering if Blizzard was planning to cut flying altogether from WoD? The forums can be a scary place sometimes. :|<br />
No. We like no flying when content is relevant. In 6.1 the Draenor zones won't be current, but there will be a new no-fly zone. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400811014708408321))<br />
<br />
No Flying till 6.1 = Awesome. Will we have FelReaver-esque SAVAGE things to look out for and remember for years to come?<br />
Yes. It is a world of giants. There are gronn and even larger things stomping about. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/401041402043170816))<br />
<br />
We have to quest to fly in 6.1? Why is Blizzard so in love with grinds? I just want to pvp.<br />
The soul of the game is progression. You overcome challenges to earn things. Rewards for free don't feel like rewards. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/401037108996866048))<br />
<br />
Put a compelling, interesting, or fun activity in that encourages people not to fly. Don’t force it<br />
Is there anything fun or compelling about raid trash? Repair costs? Earning lesser charms? Yet those still have value... (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400811733515653120))<br />
<br />
Name one thing that barring flight gives you that you couldn't do with a little bit of ingenuity without barring flight.<br />
Swoop down, kill quest target, fly away without fighting anything else. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400065798229594112))<br />
It seems a lot of the dislike for flying is from pvp? Would I be correct in that assumption?<br />
A small part of it, but we also hate the way folks quest with flying mounts. Swoop down, unlock prison cage, swoop away. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400364941405728768))<br />
Questing is boring and tedious as hell at this point. I'd rather just be done with it ASAP.<br />
We don't want it to be an endless slog, but we do view questing as a core component of the experience. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400804467236302848))<br />
<br />
Can’t wait to see the end of WoD when “No flying” is written off as a mistake after all your defending. Same as dailies were<br />
It's always possible, but we were happy with no flying until 90 and no flying on Timeless Isle or Isle of Thunder. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400804130421104640))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
Quick question: what's your favourite class/spec &amp; raid boss? I know you work in a lot of those, but pick one of each <br />
It wouldn't be prudent to answer the first. For the second, tie between new Ragnaros and Lei Shen. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400807585147658240))<br />
Lich King was amazing (fav by miles), rag was sick too though. Lei Shen has been one of the best balanced bosses tho<br />
I liked LK a lot, but if I'm being honest, too much of the fight was burning adds or Defile lightning reflexes. Still great. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/401045019005431808))<br />
<br />
can we please have CD reset on ICD effects on boss pull?<br />
We are going to work very hard to make lining up everything on the pull less of a thing. It causes bad gameplay overall. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/401042945798717440))<br />
<br />
Are we supposed to clear Normal *and* Heroic before getting to Mythic?<br />
Just heroic. If you are a mythic prone guild (mythic curious?) then normal is probably too easy and unrewarding for you. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400811259227959296))<br />
<br />
Delay the start of raiding in WoD for 1 ~ 2 weeks please! Nice to be able to level without having to rush.<br />
We think that worked out well for MoP. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/401041481277771776))<br />
<br />
Plus, the word Mythic sounds pretty awesome, in my opinion. That matters to people, right?<br />
But everyone at Blizzcon called it MYSTIC. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400373036508925952))<br />
Avoid the Mythic/Mystic confusion. Use a word you already use. Legendary Raid!<br />
When we debated that, the fear was the immediate assumption that it dropped all orange loot. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400810703671402497))<br />
<br />
While there are more 10h than 25h raiders, both groups are still very small. We support heroic raiding, but let's keep the in perspective. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400285801142964224))<br />
This is going to be like 5.0 dailies. Wrong solution to the right problem. The ICC system is preferable to a single size.<br />
The problem with ICC is the 10-player raiders felt like second class citizens since the ilevels were lower. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400370489115160576))<br />
So how does returning ten mans to second class status make sense now? That is where they are going back to.<br />
Ten player raiding is extremely popular and we are going to continue to support it. Ten player heroic raiding is much less popular. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400809474455130112))<br />
<br />
For the much larger population of 10n players, flex in 6.0 will only help them. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400286091405570048))<br />
The problem with flex is, people stop at 13-14 players because mechanics switch to 25m mode. People dont want to fill up.<br />
There are some break points today, but we've fixed most of those for 6.0. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400416876309647360))<br />
<br />
Will Mythic mode have to be unlocked by completing Heroic mode? Much like going from Normal mode &gt; Heroic mode is now.<br />
Not sure yet, but it will definitely unlock a week later like it does today. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400365947539570688))<br />
but we can start in heroic mode right?Two clears before we can &quot;start&quot; would kinda kill the excitement IMO<br />
Current plan (could change) is N and H on week two, Mythic on week three (if you've beaten H) and LFR after that. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400809187627638784))<br />
<br />
It looks like it's an RL option, like today it's just another option on the list.<br />
Correct. In LFR it's always personal. Else, raid leader can choose. You can argue he or she should go personal in a pug. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400421070324248576))<br />
Can you tell if the groups made from the new Browsing Raid will be able to change Loot Specialization middle raid?<br />
Sure. We'll likely still have bonus rolls, and those are always personal even if your loot system is not. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400425732792262656))<br />
Would you consider keeping all mount/pet drops as personal even if loot system is not?<br />
I'd worry that some groups like to decide who gets the mount. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400801858941247488))<br />

Computers - Setup of the Month (by chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud))<br />
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud) will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
New GPUs from AMD are on the way, so if you are only upgrading your GPU it might be worth it to wait a month or two.<br />
<br />
The current SSD prices (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/november/ssdgraph.gif) are stable, with most SSDs under $1 per gigabyte when on sale. RAM prices are remaining high. <br />
<br />
The Haswell CPUs (http://www.anandtech.com/show/7003/the-haswell-review-intel-core-i74770k-i54560k-tested/1) run a little bit on the warmer side. Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VKVZ1A?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002VKVZ1A) or H90 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B4OCWDE?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00B4OCWDE). <br />
<br />
Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 4770K and should spend that money elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date.<br />

No. We like no flying when content is relevant. In 6.1 the Draenor zones won't be current, but there will be a new no-fly zone. <br />
<br />
<br />
That makes no sense.<br />
6.1 does not make the zones irrelevant. Only for people who are past them, if the zones are designed not to be flown over, then they should not be flown over.<br />
Either cut flying or dont, stop bloody dithering and pissing everyone off.</div></div><hr />

Guess you weren't around for the start of Pandaria then...because it was exactly the same thing.<br />
<br />
Also yes as a lfr only player you are a second class citizen when it comes to them catering to raid content for you. They want people to look at higher difficulties before they look at lfr, unlocking lfr off the bat only promotes the notion that lfr is required to do anything else. You get your easy mode difficulty be happy that you have atleast something, they could have scrapped the idea entirely at the end of Cata and told casual raiders to screw off or be in a raiding guild.</div></div><hr />

As for Karazhan, they might do something like they did in the pre-WotLK release, with a sort of &quot;phased&quot; quest inside of it. I assume afterwards it'd pretty much just return to normal.<br />
<br />
I mean so far all they've done is clear out the spiderwebs... doesn't look like they're doing anything too drastic. I would like to know if that extends for the whole tower, though, or just the ballroom and dining room, as shown in the pictures.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Perhaps the reverse Karazhan we've heard so much about is actually located in this alternate Draenor. Perhaps that's where Kairozdormu found out about it, maybe he heard about this reverse Karazhan, went and explored, and found that the path between Karazhan and reverse Karazhan was actually a portal, leading to Draenor in another timeline. It could have been an experiment by Medivh. That would explain how Gorehowl ended up there.</div></div><hr />

No. We like no flying when content is relevant. In 6.1 the Draenor zones won't be current, but there will be a new no-fly zone. <br />
<br />
<br />
That makes no sense.<br />
6.1 does not make the zones irrelevant. Only for people who are past them, if the zones are designed not to be flown over, then they should not be flown over.<br />
Either cut flying or dont, stop bloody dithering and pissing everyone off.<br />
<br />
But it does make sense. And the zones ARE designed to be flown over. Blizzard isn't against flying, .. they're just against flying when it gives you a clear shortcut path right away when an expansion hits. Content will be &quot;relevant&quot; when 6.1 hits, to an extent, if 5.1 is any other indicator. And not just to &quot;people who are past them&quot;, .. as my guess is you'll still have to be level 100 to get flying, once 6.1 hits, if Pandaria is any indicator. <br />
<br />
When 5.1 came out, most players who kept up to date with the game were max level and had at least traveled into all the new areas (although not necessarily done all the quests). In this sense, .. yeah, a lot of the content was irrelevant. Questing in Jade Forest was irrelevant to me at level 90, just as the beginner area of Draenor will be irrelevant to me at 100. If you're level 95 when patch 6.1 hits? You'll probably have to wait until you're 100 .. and by that point a lot of the content you can now fly around in will be irrelevant, too.</div></div><hr />

Karazhan is a place of great magical power and knowledge, so anyone based there might be able to get advanced warning if something funky starts happening with the timeways. Since the tower is associated with the Kirin Tor, then Khadgar's presence there would be fairly logical.<br />
<br />
Also, as far as I know there is no direct evidence to suggest Khadgar was part of the suicide mission to close the Dark Portal. Maybe in the pre-event Khadgar manages to tap into magic Kairoz uses to transport Garrosh into the past and ends up on past alternate Draenor before they build their Dark Portal. Once he realizes Garrosh is now guiding the Horde, he tells the Draenei. The Draenei, this time knowing exactly what's going down, militarize much earlier then they did in the original timeline and are able to hold off the Iron Horde much more effectively for much longer.<br />
<br />
So by the time Alliance players track him down, he's already been on Draenor for a year or two and knows the lay of the land.</div></div><hr />

Karazhan and the timeless isle are possibly the only places in Azeroth where time altering effects exist in a way that is completely separate from the bronze dragonflight.

<br />
Top of tower while in the raid is different than tower top outside of it. Possibly part of another dimension? As you climb the tower, things get stranger and stranger.<br />
<br />
Prince Malch had a strange loot table. A blood elven bow (possibly something from Kael'thas during his pact with Kil'Jaedin?) and he had Gorhowl, the axe both Grom and Garrosh use(d). He also had quotes such as &quot;All realities, all dimensions are open to me!&quot; reffering to the possibility of Karazhan having time travel/dimension hopping abilities.<br />
<br />
I think Medivh is definitely the one who alters the Dark Portal and potentially the last boss of WoD. They said the ending of WoD will tie into the next expansion. Medivh would definitely be able to lead into the Burning Legion expack that's almost certain to follow WOD. And I hope they scenario a version of Kara for a pre-WOD event, possibly with a Khadgar vs Medivh moment! :P</div></div><hr />

The soul of the game is progression. You overcome challenges to earn things. Rewards for free don't feel like rewards&quot;<br />
<br />
Hey you know what else doesn't feel like rewards? EARNING THE SAME SHIT EACH GOD DAMNED EXPANSION.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
But it does make sense. And the zones ARE designed to be flown over. Blizzard isn't against flying, .. they're just against flying when it gives you a clear shortcut path right away when an expansion hits. Content will be &quot;relevant&quot; when 6.1 hits, to an extent, if 5.1 is any other indicator. And not just to &quot;people who are past them&quot;, .. as my guess is you'll still have to be level 100 to get flying, once 6.1 hits, if Pandaria is any indicator. <br />
<br />
When 5.1 came out, most players who kept up to date with the game were max level and had at least traveled into all the new areas (although not necessarily done all the quests). In this sense, .. yeah, a lot of the content was irrelevant. Questing in Jade Forest was irrelevant to me at level 90, just as the beginner area of Draenor will be irrelevant to me at 100. If you're level 95 when patch 6.1 hits? You'll probably have to wait until you're 100 .. and by that point a lot of the content you can now fly around in will be irrelevant, too.<br />
<br />
So they unlock flying once we no longer need to visit a zone, but only if we do some kind of patch-spanning chain even on our dedicated healer alts, eh? That sounds like a lot of fun. See if you can guess whether I'm being sarcastic or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This expansions end boss: Sargeras-possessed Medivh. He obtains information from us (or future NPCs that come with us into the portal) enabling him to avoid mistakes made in the past and he is able to avoid death at the hands of his apprentice and Lothar. Thus death by large groups of heroes is necessary.<br />
<br />
Next expansion after WoD: Sargeras-Medivh was somehow able to communicate via the new Dark Portal with our timelines Sargeras, he now knows some kind of something that gives him a way to get at us. Srs business legion invasion of Azeroth. In an epic pre expansion patch event the likes of which have been missing since the pre WotLK zombie apocalypse; the world burns. All hope is lost. Who will save us? -=Bolvar and his scourge=- /heavy metal guitar solo.<br />
<br />
Then again I may be totally messed up on the timeline and inside the portal Medivh is already dead or not even close to dead yet.<br />
<br />
Also that cosplay... at first I'm impressed. But something about having a whole facebook page dedicated to you doing cosplay makes it seem significantly less impressive to me.</div></div><hr />

No, I think that part of a quest chain is going to lead us into Kara to retrieve something or try to stop garrosh from getting something to use on the dark portal. Since its labeled as a phase I dont think it will be a new dungeon/raid.</div></div><hr />

If they have something to show, let them, as long as they are not forced doing it, I'm perfectly fine with it even if they show up naked. Considering 60% of iconic figures in Warcraft are depicted half-naked in the game and artwork they fit in perfectly.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think the vast majority of the playerbase that doesn't do LFR often considers LFR people to be second class sub players, if not third. That place is horrendous.<br />
<br />
And rightfully so, considering almost everyone running LFR two days after reset can't even press two buttons when they glow up to get over acceptable damage done or healing done, they shouldn't even get there, in fact there should be a damage done/healing done treshold, if you're below that - no loot.</div></div><hr />

Actually yes, most of the nerfs, including the creation of Flex dificulty, came from trying to make LFR players go try something harder.<br />

Its nothing like this. Yes this is prob how the community see it, but not how Blizzard does. There are 2 main reasons. Why should someone like me who works 12hr shifts and cannot really focus on end game raiding, get to kill the last boss in the raid, on a faceroll difficulty before people like Method and Paragon? We get buffs to kill the boss everytime we wipe...they get repair bills. The other reason its not getting released on par with normal is the fact of DS LFR. People abused that and got tier bonuses in LFR to breeze through normal content. This is prob the main reason why Blizzard wont release it on par.</div></div><hr />

Yes unfortunately, because Blizz did what they did with DS LFR in Cata and so now we have what we have today because people abused the system which was Blizzards fault because they should have seen that folks would do this to get ahead by fair means or foul and in this case it was somewhat fair not really in the spirit of things but fair none the less because Blizz stuffed up the initial release of LFR..<br />

I think we'll all have a good laugh when we look back at this thread one quarter after WoD is released after a nice dip in subs they will backtrack this whole &quot;not let people fly&quot; thing.

There is no 'backtrack' unless they backtrack before they implement it. They're holding it back for one patch. If one patch is too much for people to wait, then that's their problem; I'd prefer the game lose those subs and get better than continue to cater to the whiny bastards who can't stand to actually play the game, and would rather rush to the end so they can complain about nothing to do in the end.</div></div><hr />

No matter what you think, end game in WoW is about all that matters. People are still gonna rush regardless of flying or not, and the only thing restricting flight does is limit the amount of people solo leveling through the world to 100, instead forcing groups to grind certain mobs for max XP, or causing that sweet &quot;AFK in SW and dungeon queue spam&quot; we're all such fans of. It isn't going to bring back WPVP or entice people to &quot;slooooow down&quot; and enjoy the zones, just like Pandaria didn't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't care for PvP, world or not. And it is more than enough reason for me to slow down and enjoy myself because there isn't a nagging feeling in the back of my head telling me I'm going slower than I could be, simply because I'm not riding a flying mount that skips over the twists and turns in the road. People seem to ignore that flying trivializes the world so much that there might as well not be a world to explore. People would still go out into the old world when there wasn't flying, people will still go out into the new world when there isn't flying.<br />
<br />
And, just like LFR's ques, it will keep people seeing the world the Devs work hard to create for us for just a bit longer. Until they're sick of it, specifically. And regardless of flying or not, people will get sick of the new world just like all the others, and the world will return to que's from (insert new major city here) while riding (insert favorite mount here).</div></div><hr />

Blizzard isn't &quot;taking away&quot; anyone's flying in Draenor because you can't fly there yet. You could say that if they were, say, removing flying in Northrend.<br />
<br />
This really isn't a big deal. I'm pretty sure while I was watching the live stream or subsequent interviews that it was said that they were at least thinking about removing the gold sink for it and just making it a quest chain. I'd rather spend a couple days doing non-repetitive quests with some lore attached to them than spending weeks saving up gold (per alt) to purchase it.<br />
<br />
However, even if I'm wrong on that (admittedly rather vague) memory, I'd still rather have content to drive game mechanics than just mechanics (gold and a level cap) to drive mechanics.<br />
<br />
Also, they've done account-bound quest chains before. Most recently, the pet quest chains are all account-bound. It's not like it's impossible.</div></div><hr />

We can't play all day so thus not see all content, EXCEPT if the content is not as much as &quot;the usual&quot; so they can actually fill expansions with less content, but release it faster and make it LOOK like they do more.<br />
An example; you don't get flying in WoD, so you run to your places slower, so it takes more time to get somewhere, to complete an objective, thus either; not complete all objectives since it takes more time, or you do complete it but at a slower phase = shows it's less content since you can complete it in the same amount of time as before...</div></div><hr />

It requires dizzying heights of narcissism to call someone who disagrees with you &quot;illogical.&quot;<br />
<br />
It is not a matter of &quot;logic&quot; whether you think that &quot;reward&quot; is an apporpriate way to describe something that you give something, take away, and then return at a later date once they've &quot;earned it.&quot;<br />
<br />
If the &quot;soul of the game,&quot; as the say, is progression then one would expect to progress, not to regress. Progression means advancing. Going from flying to not-flying and then back to flying again is NOT &quot;progression.&quot; It is going in circles.<br />
<br />
To be clear, I'm fully in support of no-fly zones. I think it's a good way to design content. I just think it's silly to try and pretend it's about making players feel &quot;rewarded.&quot; It is a design choice, period. That's it. It's easier and faster to design good content if players can't fly. So Blizzard should just say that and drop this bullshit about rewards and &quot;earning&quot; the right to fly and shit. It just sounds stupid and insulting.</div></div><hr />

You understand that I was responding to someone who made a ridiculous claim and pointing out how ridiculous it was by extending their logic, right? It was an analogy, and it holds perfectly true if you read the post I was quoting.<br />

If you try to claim that Blizzard is &quot;not taking anything away&quot; because we don't currently have the ability to fly in Draenor then the same silly logic could be used to support removal of ground mounts or shields.</div></div><hr />

Which they could certainly do, and since everyone is on the same playing field it would be perfectly fair/reasonable. In some ways, I wish Blizzard would come out and say &quot;You're right, having an epic quest to regain flying in WoD is silly. Thus, flying is out of WoD permanently&quot;. They are designing WoD around not having flying there. It isn't like they are making Area 52 with areas that require a flying mount and then laughing at us. Or at least so far as we know...</div></div><hr />

Still, besides not having flying because of the lack of content (which is likely to be the reason, since flying speeds up &quot;content&quot; consumption - which is why you cant fly during levelling in current content) there is no one who loses when they just let you fly at level 100 again, especially not on PVE servers where the amount of kiddie gankers is minimal.<br />
<br />
Its not even the fact that flying is postponed to patch 6.1 that bothers me, its the fact that blizzard is now catering to the anti-social whiners who feel that their game enjoyment is inversely proportional to others having fun, just because that group is vocal doesnt mean blizzard should listen to them, its the same people that cry their little eyes out when someone else has an purple item and their e-peen isnt stroked enough when standing in &lt;insert major faction city&gt;.<br />
<br />
Its all about removing choice this expansion, after several expansions where they actually added new stuff and more choices, now they are restricting your mount choices without a proper reason and they will be removing reforging (which is even worse considering blizzards poor trackrecord in using the itembudgets), they won't win people back with these kinds of changes.</div></div><hr />

Thats me out. Fed up with Bliz treating LFR people as second class sub payers.<br />
<br />
That's because simply put, LFR is a second class player-pool. <br />
<br />
WoW was designed around it's endgame, Or it has evolved into that kinda outlook. The fact casuals get LFR is there answer to the &quot;second class player-pool&quot;<br />
<br />
There trying to keep content relevant for longer periods of time. So they have to scale back the places we can get acceptable loot. IE - Holding off on free loot for a little longer than normal. <br />
<br />
There not trying to be mean or overlook any one group of players. It's just certain aspects of the game take priority over others. Don't be so butt-hurt about it, Embrace it and become a normal raider, Or maybe take leveling a bit more on the lax side and get to it when you want. <br />
<br />
Ragequitting about 1 change is just childish, and not helpful to your problem or point.</div></div><hr />
