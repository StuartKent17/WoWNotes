After taxes (which are included), yes, is pretty much does. The UK conversion for pets however throws on an extra £1+; it really should be £8 if the UK wasn't being screwed.</div></div><hr />

Maybe you should read some international news... They are making it illegal to feed the homeless in a lot of american cities. Yet our president continues to hand illegal immigrants money hand over fist. Honestly most American's are worried about a few hundred people in africa more than the thousands of people in America who will freeze or starve to death this winter.<br />

Firstly not all Africans are black. <br />
<br />
Just like not all americans are any one color. Lots of light brown, and white ins africa too. I don't care the color of the skin. I just care about the people in my community, then my county, then my state, then my country, then the rest of the world. If everyone in america had more than they needed I would send my charitable donations overseas.</div></div><hr />

I hope you have been personally generous to the point of suffering before you make such an ugly statement.<br />
I could just as well say &quot;screw donating to vets, there are more deserving children who need our help.&quot;<br />

Are you serious? Taking it WAY too far. You don't care about your area that you live and work in before you care about the rest of the world? I highly doubt that.<br />
<br />
<br />
I thought I was the only one noticing a racist try to pretend they aren't racist.<br />

So, not only should they not reproduce but they also are a racist when they even blatantly say they don't care about the person's race?<br />

I really wish I could see a world where SJW's didn't exist or died out but unfortunately their obnoxious voices (and tapping of keys) is getting louder.<br />

He's saying to donate to people in your community before donating to people you don't know and can't progress your own well being as well as theirs. Ebola isn't some huge epidemic that's destroying communities and cities, it's a virus that due to some people not being clean and/or vaccinated usually kills them.</div></div><hr />

Ignorance begets ignorance, and this is a prime example.<br />
<br />
Ebola has nothing to do with hygiene and there IS NO VACCINATION.<br />
<br />
You and the guy making comments against donations to &quot;africans&quot; seem to be cut from the same cloth, and it looks ugly to me.<br />
<br />
Yes, it's essential to consider those who are needy and right in front of us, but we also can't pretend that events on the other side of the world have no meaning. Ugh. What hateful thinking you're demonstrating.<br />

How about Americans remember that the world is full of human beings and donate to whichever cause is important to them? Simply because they life in one part of the world or another shouldn't prevent them from receiving aid and support during a crisis.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agree. However, the point of attempting to donate to homeless, starving veterans who helped maintain the position of fruitfulness you now have will always weigh more than a random person somewhere else who is equally in dire straits. To reiterate, no one is saying you shouldn't attempt to help everyone, but one is obviously slightly more deserving of your donations in any logical discussion. To say otherwise is quite myopic.</div></div><hr />

You can still fly everywhere, except Draenor. Flying has not been &quot;removed from the game&quot;, though it's hard to tell sometimes with all the QQ about it.<br />

I'm queued for this pet as well and have been for about 2 hours. My boyfriend got his instantly and bought his about 5 minutes before I bought mine. /shrug<br />

Hmm.. 30$ on a couple of items within a game consisting of hundreds of said items, or $30 on a new game entirely.. Tough choice.<br />

Don't know why you're even complaining about gathering. Because of no flying it keeps prices up in gathering materials and in turn creating items.<br />
<br />
More time = higher cost. You have less people willing to gather on the ground = additional rise in cost.<br />
<br />
More money in your pocket from those too lazy. <br />
<br />
Not even going to go into how much more enjoyable it is to run into players again out in the world. Helping each other with rares, quests and so forth.</div></div><hr />

Finally, someone who gets it. Blizzard is riding a wave of media buzz in order to make a profit off something that should be free.<br />
<br />
What annoys me is that Blizzard fanatics have the audacity to attack people who are against these sales by saying they don't support the cause. Those people are not buying these mounts/pets out of the goodness of their hearts - the charity aspect of it draws in more consumers because they now have an excuse to open their wallets with less buyer's remorse, which greatly works in Blizzard's favor.<br />
<br />
I've been donating to the Red Cross since 2011 without the incentive for &quot;rewards&quot;. I guarantee that the vast majority of people buying these mounts would never donate without an incentive to gain something in return. I'm not claiming that they are an evil corporation, and yes some of the money goes to charity, but this entire thing is about making money and charging absurd amounts for digital items made from existing skeletons.</div></div><hr />

I never said flying was new content. I was responding to the comment about flying still being available pre-draenor (i.e in old-content) as if that somehow matters to players who are trying to play new content. <br />
My point was that if Blizzard didn't bother adding raids in WoD you wouldn't see people saying &quot;They didn't remove raiding, there's still plenty of raids in Pandaria or Outland.&quot; That would be stupid because raiding is a key feature we expect to come with a new expansion, just like flying. <br />
<br />
Just because it isn't important to you, doesn't mean it isn't important to others and having Blizzard sell a new flying mount while still not making any comment about the issue, just makes it worse.<br />
<br />

Regardless of opinion on the actual issue, this is simply wrong. 100% of the cost is going to the Red Cross, so Blizzard is not only not proffiting but they are losing money due to the time/resources spent making the pet while they earn nothing from it.<br />
<br />
If you don't agree with the cause/charity that's fine don't donate, but don't try to accuse Blizz of making a quick buck here. Things like the mounts, yeah that's shitty, they should be free in-game. The yearly(ish) charity pets are one of the good things they do though.</div></div><hr />

To be fair, they did clarify it was Ebola in Africa... in places in West Africa it is not a cause celeb, it is a serious problem and donations to that are not wasted. These are places with one doctor for 10,000 people and facilities that are not up to the needs of a serious disease. The good news is those are both problems that money can actually help fix. <br />
<br />
If they said it was just &quot;ebola relief&quot; I might be a bit more cynical. But in this case it seems on the up-and-up. The Red Cross is fine by me.</div></div><hr />

So what exactly is your problem? Of course they are going to try and make money with these items. They are, like you said, a corporation. Welcome to the real world. And when some of the money goes to charity then all I can say is good on them! Even if people buy the stuff for other reasons than to donate... everybody wins here so why the hell would people criticise this? No one is forcing you to buy these items. You just sound like someone who want's attention. Well done for donating to the Red Cross but that does not entitle you to judge others on what they spend their money on.</div></div><hr />

Nah, flying isn't going to come back. They've found the easiest way to allow them to slow down open world game play. Remove flying and park everyone in the WoW version of a Facebook click game (Garrisons). <br />

It's looking like blizzard is doing that now too, how long before they release an expansion for 60$, then release zones from that expansion cut away from the expansion as DLC for $10+ more each.</div></div><hr />

However, the point of attempting to donate to homeless, starving veterans who helped maintain the position of fruitfulness you now have will always weigh more than a random person somewhere else who is equally in dire straits. To reiterate, no one is saying you shouldn't attempt to help everyone, but one is obviously slightly more deserving of your donations in any logical discussion. To say otherwise is quite myopic.<br />
<br />
I am supporting war veterans all over the world, but not because you think you have some imaginary fruitfulness from them, when they fight on the opposite side of the planet, in a country where electricity is a luxury, but because they get wounded, crippled and it wasn't their choice to go there in the first place. They deserve better when they get home, this is why I support them, but please, noone in the US is living better because of the Afghan war or the Iraqi invasion - clearly politicians, corporations and lobbyists are filling their pockets with wars, but not you average person, you are still in the same rut so to speak.</div></div><hr />

This is to entice more people to queue as tanks, which in turn makes the queues shorter for us poor DPS. I think its a fantastic thing! If you don't like it, roll a tank and make yourself and all of the rest of us DPS happier :)</div></div><hr />

And a flying mount, no less, that most people will never actually see in flight because nowhere worth going has flight?<br />
<br />
Morhaime must have a truly evil laugh by this point ;)<br />
<br />
&quot;Nowhere worth going&quot; isn't true. You act like zones such as goldshire or capital cities back on Azeroth are not populated at all. Second of all, considering the fact all flying mounts work as ground mounts (yes, even the unconventional ones such as drakes or serpents) in Draenor regardless, I don't think this is a big deal anyways. Especially for a mount that looks more like a ground mount to begin with.</div></div><hr />

Okay, I'll stop tanking randoms. Enjoy your longer queues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Imagine a car dealer who sold you a car but neglected to mention tires weren't included. It technically still works, it's just not as fast, right? Maybe grinding metal on pavement is engaging gameplay?<br />
<br />
I just don't get the devs/players who think that grinding through nuisance mobs or having to go 40x out of your way to find a ramp to get a piece of timber is somehow fun. Give me the tools, I'll tell you what I think is fun.</div></div><hr />
