Siiz (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/senjin/Siiz/advanced) from Premonition (http://premoguild.com/forums/portal.php) recently acquired Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71086/dragonwrath-tarecgosas-rest/) and answered some more questions (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2973251647) about it on the Official forums. The short version version being that the proc acts just like you are casting a copy of the spell again. You can see a quick World of Logs test here (http://www.worldoflogs.com/reports/96oh0uib5qg7n4x1/). <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
When a direct damage spell causes a proc, the same spell is cast again instantly with no travel time.<br />
The direct damage proc can crit, hit, or miss, just like casting a normal spell.<br />
When a DoT spell causes a proc, the Wrath of Tarecgosa (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/101085/wrath-of-tarecgosa/) spell is cast instantly, matching the DoT spell's damage.<br />
The proc consumes buffs like Fingers of Frost (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/83074/fingers-of-frost/), just like manually casting the same spell again would.<br />
The proc also causes buffs, such as when a proc occurs from Arcane Blast (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/30451/arcane-blast/).<br />
Spells that are not direct damage or DoT will not cause a proc. (e.g. Frostfire Orb (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/92283/frostfire-orb/))<br />
A proc from a proc hasn't occurred yet.<br />

Siiz explained how he got the staff so quickly on his guild's forum.<br />
<br />
From the Premonition Forums (http://www.premoguild.com/forums/showpost.php?p=39289&amp;postcount=3):<br />
To anyone who said I exploited, I didn't and never would. Let me explain how it went down.<br />
<br />
I finished my eternal embers part the week we got 6/7 HM (the reset of July 5th) so I started my branch quest the next week (the week of July 12). People didn't realize you could get the portal quest items from normal mode and not have to kill the bosses so in the end we got all the quest items from normal mode bosses and killed the legendary boss. After we killed the legendary boss we cleared 6/7 hardmodes on the week of July 12th (the same reset we did portal quest). Each 25M heroic boss drops 50?-64? cinders with normal rag at the time dropping~55ish?<br />
<br />
I collected all my cinders and got the runestaff about halfway through the raid week of the 26th, leaving about 2-3? bosses up that week for me to collect souls from. Heroic 25M bosses give 17-19 souls per boss. So even if I got the worst luck in the world at 17 a boss I still would have made it in 2 1/2 weeks. <br />
<br />
I collected souls from those 2-3 bosses + the next two full weeks to get it.<br />

T11 JP shoulders and helm - some clarity<br />
We've offered players who don't raid a reasonable way to gear up, and achieve high levels of power. The JP/VP system makes a lot of sense to us, and gives everyone a pretty good personal progression track in addition to loot drops, and we feel pretty good about the system as it stands. That doesn't necessarily mean that we think that full sets are a necessary part of that picture, though.<br />
<br />
We still want to preserve some of the most prestigious PvE loot for players who face down raid content (even if it's a tier behind), and we feel that completing a tier set means that a raid needs to fit in there somewhere. That design makes sense to us, and we want to preserve some of the reward for facing down those bad guys. We re-adjusted those instances specifically to encourage players to go experience them, and we want to leave some incentives in there for players who check those raids out.<br />
<br />
[...] We want rewards to retain at least some meaning, because when they don't, all the aspects of play start to blend together. Greater challenges should offer greater rewards, but how do you accomplish that if you also allow lesser challenges to provide all the same rewards, across the board? That's been a long-standing challenge, I think, and the JP/VP system is the compromise answer to it. Please recall that at one time if you wanted purps then you went into a raid, period. We've come a long, long way since then. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/190388/t11-jp-shoulders-and-helm-some-clarity) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2973251287?page=12#226))<br />

15 Man Raids!<br />
I'd actually agree that 15 players make for a pretty optimal number of raiders, in terms of the logistics of forming a raid and class representation. The task of tuning raids for three separate sizes is one you probably won't see on our radar any time soon though. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/190281/15-man-raids) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2973250971?page=1#6))<br />

45 Minute Dungeon Queue Times (MMO-Champion Note: Hinting to Scenarios? (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2366-Scenario-Alcaz-Island-Firelands-Dailies-Progression-Raidcomp-Firelands-Raid-Solo))<br />
We'd like to keep the traditional setting of 5-player dungeons as 1 tank, 1 healer, and 3 DPS. The idea of just adding in NPCs to fill lacking roles is truly not a simple one, nor a route we'd want to take. Not only would this take a lot of design time for a less-than-desirable fix, it'd stand at odds with our philosophy on dungeons for small groups. <br />
<br />
That said, you do raise some good points about offering challenging, rewarding content to players which doesn't rely solely on players waiting for a specific class role which is in high demand across the boards. In our minds, there's potentially something missing between daily quests and dungeons, from a content/progression perspective. To that end, we're exploring some options for the future.

Limited Number of Characters<br />
It has always been a matter of efficiency in data service. Much like the fabrication of a commercial airplane, the design of the server side of a service like World of Warcraft affects what can be provided to the players for as long as that service is being used.<br />
<br />
With an airplane, you can conceivably add more seats inside. You can squeeze more people in there, to a point. But you can't (easily) expand the hull to make room for more seats. Over the long run, if the airline wants to accommodate more people, they add more planes to the route, or replace an existing plane with a larger plane that has room for more seats.<br />
<br />
This request - which is heard loud and clear, by the way - is like asking the airline to simultaneously increase the number of passengers that can be carried on every plane in their fleet. Can it be done? Absolutely. It may be something that we are able to do, and soon. It may not be, because providing reliable data service is extremely important to us.

Lower level PvP Concerns<br />
We are not deaf to the concerns raised about low-level PvP. We feel it needs some attention too. We don't necessarily feel that it's all just &quot;a heirloom issue,&quot; but more to do with time investments reaping rewards that give too great an advantage. While we do agree that low-level PvP isn't in an ideal state and has needed further consideration, our focus has remained where the players are: max-level PvP. <br />
<br />
We don't intend to throw oil on the flame by such a comment and this doesn't mean we're completely ignorant of niche playstyles, just that we focus our efforts on where it'll have the greatest effect. What's the answer? We do hear the feedback. When we have looked at the issue, it has simply just seemed too difficult – too tricky – to resolve in a way that we're happy with. <br />
<br />
We currently believe resolving it will require much time and effort. But we acknowledge things aren't as great for low-level PvP as they could be and we do have a desire to pay attention to it.

I would rather have balance issues which are potentially going to be resolved in the future instead of way overgeared players who are there to gank and win through superior gear and brute force rather than being there to just play.<br />

I guess it just ends up with luck on the Seething Cinders part. If he only had 1 boss left in the raid week of the 26th, after Cinders, he'd end up with 247 essences (when obtaining 19 essences every time, off all 6 bosses) during this raid week.<br />

As for the pvp issue, players are asking Blizz to balance it... what, by putting heirloom players in their own bracket? Increasing queue times? Leaving heirloom players with seemingly never-ending queue times? Instead of whining about it, you could be farming your own heirlooms, and twinking out your own characters.<br />
<br />
Kinda not happy with the raid tier issue, but... I can try and work with it. If I can find a PUG...<br />
<br />
15-man sounds interesting... so does adding more character slots. Do want!</div></div><hr />

Why bother putting any effort into raiding if you can just kill the first few bosses to get all your teir? I would have nothing to look forward to if you could just gear up with VPs.

Wouldn't it be better to have the item scale with current gear? (Who wouldn't want to carry around thunderfury today?) It would retain the items value but only stay ahead of the gear in the initial months of having it.<br />
<br />
Install a system where the item would only scale within a certain time period of achieving it (so people couldn't go back and get them). By winter the only reason i'll have the staff is for the pride and the mount.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naturae</div><div class="date">2011-08-13, 04:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You guys are all talking about the issue coming from HEIRLOOM gear. If you believe that's the only issue low-level pvp has then you're completely mistaken.Main issues range from:1) Heirloom gear giving benefits as well as stunting growth in stats2) Every 10 levels, starting at the upper 50's there's a huge FLAW. A player at level 57 fighting against a player level 58 should not be that predictable of a match...however, if the play at level 58 has even a FEW pieces of level 58 questing gear then the player at level 57 stands absolutely no chance, almost completely regardless of skill. This again happens at 67-68. And then, the worst jump and most skewed bracket, the ones with 77-78. Heirloom gear during these brackets actually stunts your ability to kill people as just regular greens have higher stats than your heirlooms.3) Since this expac started, they &quot;balanced&quot; out all classes in a way that made them all scale roughly the same way. Because of this theory they had, they completely broke everything having to do with low-level dps and healing abilities. Aimed Shot, Ambush, Starfire, and Penance are alll great examples of this &quot;flaw.&quot;So, a good portion of these balance issues do extend from heirloom gear and could be fixed with heirloom gear scaling on, not only a per-level basis, but also a per-expansion gear-reachable basis as well. However, fixing heirloom gear isn't going to solve even 50% of the major concerns with low-level pvp. Blizzard ignoring the issue isn't much help either.</div></div><hr />

Go ahead I was just copying what Siiz posted in his official forums thread.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scratches</div><div class="date">2011-08-13, 06:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow. So, essentially, what he's saying about low-level pvp is that it's too hard for them to balance properly &lt;insert picture of whining developer&gt;, and because of that everyone just has to make do with utterly embarrassing shite until they deem the job easy enough (which will most likely be 'wipe the slate clean and start over again', again) for them to apply more than just lip service to.<br />
<br />
Not that I really care about low level pvp any more though, as I've essentially given up on it - and, to an extent, Blizzard itself - and this 'response' on the issue is vindication enough...<br />
<br />
Additionally, player level concentration (derp, of course the population is going to pool at the top (leveling is like travelling down a river, and the level cap is a dam... do I really need to explain this? lol)) shouldn't matter though, as a player is a player is a player -- they're all equally important to the health of the game, no matter what level their character is. <br />
If a player is unhappy with the state of the early game, how certain are they that said player will &quot;stick it out&quot; just because other people tell them it gets better at max level? Have they really gotten to the point where they're absolutely fine with or even don't care about taking that gamble? And lastly, isn't alienating a demographic (that has semi-previously existed in-game) the complete antithesis to how they try to market the game? <br />
<br />
...or was that the proposed subtitle for Cataclysm (&quot;Putting the War Back in Warcraft: Now With More Demos! &lt;picture of many Demolisher catapults&gt; Demolishing Demonic Demographics and Democracies!&quot;)? No? :confused: lol<br />
<br />
(Anyone else notice that there's also &quot;raft&quot; in the title? People say there should be more war because &quot;war&quot; is in the title... well, there should be more rafts too then, damnit! :rolleyes:)<br />
<br />
* * *<br />
<br />
Anyway... If I were a major investor or stakeholder, I would be livid about this, lol. This kind of a response just reeks of either ineptitude, laziness, or complacency on a massive scale, and additionally, it also sounds like someone's trying to make excuses to justify said traits; none of which paint a very nice image of Blizzard's ethics. And such ethics in turn affect their income and my currently mythical return on investment, as their decision, as it stands right now, has the very obvious possibility of turning away new players who enjoy pvp and are looking for a good/fun experience... <br />
(being &quot;good&quot; at the end does not justify absolute crap before that point (aka, &quot;the ends don't justify the means&quot;).)<br />
But I'm not an investor nor a stakeholder, so I just shrug, laugh, and continue waiting for The Old Republic and Guild Wars 2 instead. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
It did more then that. 1.5% is the amount that he was testing the dot portion of the proc. The proc itself has about a 10% chance to proc whatever is going on. Whether it's Arcane Blast, each tick of Arcane Missiles (channeled casts such as Arcane Missiles, Blizzard, Drain Life, and Mind Flay are able to proc per tick so a 5 tick Arcane Missile could become a 6-7 tick Arcane Missile), Living Bomb tick, Ignite (the last two are what you are seeing the staff buff from), or Arcane Explosion.</div></div><hr />

nope, that spell in the logs is only for duplicating the dot ticks, the direct damage spells that were cast by procs cast the same spell again instantly, so its going to be a bit harder to find that data in the log<br />

I'm sure he only posted lucky proc streaks from combat log but what they tell is that the staff has no ICD. So RNG kings get to arena and pick up your free glad or R1 even.

I don't play my druid as boomkin but from what I know of the spec, it would be 1 x &quot;Insect Swarm&quot; and each tick would proc the exact same damage as Wrath of Tarecgosa. Again I'm not too keen on how a boomkin is played but the way it is currently being treated is if Moonfire procs, it would cast a second Moonfire and any extra damage associated with the proc (think ignite from a crit Fireball) will be treated as a proc from the staff. Also if Moonfire is needed to get into Solar Eclipse (again I don't play boomkin so I don't know this), if a Moonfire triggers Solar, but at the same time procs, the proc will take whatever buff if cast while in Solar Eclypse.</div></div><hr />

The staff doesn't have an internal cooldown and can procc from all dot ticks and direct spells. Means that it's basically just a flat bonus the scales perfectly well for anybody... except for pet users -.-</div></div><hr />

<br />
At this point we just don't know how well it scales with warlocks. The ONLY thing we have going for is that Frost Mage Water Elementals are unable to proc anything from the staff. THAT IS IT!!! They have said that the proc rate would be adjusted for &quot;pet classes.&quot; Since Water elementals only provide 8-10% of a mage's total dps that hardly compares to the 35% that they give for warlocks. So if anything it could be closer to 15-20% proc rate for warlocks when compared to 10% for mages.</div></div><hr />

The direct damage proc can crit, hit, or miss, just like casting a normal spell.<br />
When a DoT spell causes a proc, the Wrath of Tarecgosa (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/101085/wrath-of-tarecgosa/) spell is cast instantly, matching the DoT spell's damage.<br />
The proc consumes buffs like Fingers of Frost (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/83074/fingers-of-frost/), just like manually casting the same spell again would.<br />
The proc also causes buffs, such as when a proc occurs from Arcane Blast (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/30451/arcane-blast/).<br />
Spells that are not direct damage or DoT will not cause a proc. (e.g. Frostfire Orb (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/92283/frostfire-orb/))<br />
A proc from a proc hasn't occurred yet.<br />
<br />
It cant proc from dot dmg, but can proc on dot cast, meaning a &quot;Moonfire&quot; tick cant proc, but when I cast &quot;Moonfire&quot; it can proc = 2 dots, atleast what I understand it as<br />

As I said before I don't play boomkin so I wasn't as privy to that info (I just knew that Moonfire had a dot mechanic attached to it as well). Didn't realize that it didn't put the debuff when in Solar eclipse. I was basing most of my info from this line that Siiz mentioned:<br />
<br />
<br />
If your &quot;copied&quot; fireball crits it will trigger ignite, and ignite also benefits from the staff proc.<br />
<br />
What he is referring to is if a Fire mage casts a critical strike Fireball, the Fireball will take a portion of that damage done and convert it into a DoT called Ignite that persists on the target for a few seconds. What he is basically saying is that if the Proc Fireball crits and causes Ignite then the Ignite will damage would be treated as a proc from the staff. (The only proc from proc that is currently the case). I haven't checked if this would cause ignite munching of any sort yet.</div></div><hr />

Thing is.. if you raid heroic modes.. and have raided any melee or even fire mage or something towards it, you wouldn't make comments like that, or then you aren't playing good^^ while arcane is starting to become easyer and easyer with gear.. its still prolly one of the hardest specs to minmax to its full potential..</div></div><hr />

I agree for class balance 15 man is optimal, but then I'd only want to see 15 man as the only raid size, not 10/15/25. And blizz being too lazy to make 3 sizes of raid is a bill bullshit, blizz spends about 5% of its mmorpg revenue on the game, which i believe includes everything from servers to staff, and they made 395 million dollars in Q2 2011, profiting billions since release. I dont think its physically impossible for them to assign another team to balance 15 man content alongside 10/25, especially seeing as other mmorpg games featuring raids (e.g. lotr) have multiple raid sizes.<br />
__<br />
low level pvp-wise, the whole thing is senseless. there are huge gear and level differences amongst many things (e.g. lvl 20 can play against a lvl 29 in a bg). fact of the matter is, you get free heirlooms (once you have full pvp/pve gear you convert JP to honor to prevent reaching 4k cap and buy heirlooms) from your main, give them to a twink and bash low level n00bs all day for lols. Even if the game took away your gear at the start of a pvp game and replaced it with default pvp gear that is the same ilvl for everyone it would not solve the level issue and class balance at lower levels (some classes learn a particular spell/ability at a certain level that puts them at an advantage over lower level players of the same class, or of the same level but of a different class). There is a place for pvp while levelling, but i see it no more than some fun when you are bored of questing and no more</div></div><hr />

It copies the tick itself, not the entire spell.<br />

He actually says that a proc will match the dot ticks just that the spell is a different name. Got to say its weird that a guild would pass to a lock first based solely on the fact they have dots :/ it's clearly going to be beneficial to to whoever gets their hands on it. In my guild we have our order of Mage, Warlock (myself), Shaman - the toons chosen not because of class but by our dedication to the guild. Oh and interesting point! I think you're right Adilina in that it probably procs from a tick and only finishes the time left. Obviously only guessing but it just seems like how it should work since it is copying dot tick for tick once it procs.</div></div><hr />

PVP SPECS UH DUH. =/ seriously if they would just do this it would save them so much time in the long run.<br />
<br />
You mean like Rift with the PvP souls? Uh, no, that wouldn't work because some people like to play a certain way with their class, and making a defined &quot;You have to spec this to pvp efficiently&quot; would eliminate a lot of choice. People like choice and making a PvP tree would be detrimental to that ability to choose, as of now some classes have 2 viable specs and some have all 3 that are viable choices.<br />
<br />
I believe a better solution would be to add alternate effects to spells when used against players, that way pvp and pve can be balanced separately without eliminating choice from the game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrile</div><div class="date">2011-08-13, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don´t understand why a game with a small dev team like DDO can craft short, fun dungeons with puzzles and traps that scale from 1 player up to 6 players. If you have never given DDO a try, it is worth it to play for a few hours just to see how they do their dungeons. Basically every dungeon has 5 difficulty levels. 1 is casual and is like story-mode for solo characters. 2 is normal and can be accomplished by a solo player 3 is hard mode, and is a challange for a solo player, or fairly easy for a few players. 4 is elite and is nearly impossible for a solo player, but is appropriate for a group. 5 is epic and is like doing a heroic dungeon in wow. The devs do a nice job of giving alternative routes within each dungeon, so players that can´t disable traps can avoid them, but maybe have to fight a few extra monsters etc. There are also a ton of rare bosses in almost every dungeon, which if they appear, can make certain areas a little extra difficult... so you can´t just face-roll through trash mobs because there might be a boss mob mixed in their. I think Blizzard realized that casual players needed progression... but their solution was to make raids so easy and accessible and then expect everyone to do them. I hope the hint from the blue is that they are going to try more DDO type dungeons.. where they scale from being soloable and provide real drops. You can get a lot of challenge in wow by trying to solo old dungeons, but mostly it is just a mental challenge, and there is no gear involved. But it feels a lot like doing a DDO dungeon... except in DDO you are doing level-appropraiate stuff and getting gear.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard made Zandalari in a way that DPS role is important, and require knowledge and skill to play, but players still thing that Damage role is fight each other at recount, and turn the tank and healer lives a hell. So as long as the majority of player still sustain the culture that DPS is easycake, they will both avoid those roles, and scare the people who want to fill those roles. If at least people LEARNED the DPS role, the tanks would be more prone to play. And even if Blizzard created Tank NPCs, those bad players would NEVER play with them, because there is no way a NPC would avoid wipes as a human player tank do.</div></div><hr />

I didn't even realise people were QQing about THIS. Seems pretty obvious to me - if you raid well you get gear rewards, just in the same way that if you pvp well you get gear rewards. Why bother putting any effort into raiding if you can just kill the first few bosses to get all your teir? I would have nothing to look forward to if you could just gear up with VPs. Casuals are already being catered for by even allowing points to buy as much teir as it does atm!<br />
You will be surprised about what ppl QQ about. But yea I read a thread last week about someone who wanted the helm and shoulders via points. Because he didn't want to lead a raid and next to that; he wasn't doing that much in the game. <br />
<br />

That said, you do raise some good points about offering challenging, rewarding content to players which doesn't rely solely on players waiting for a specific class role which is in high demand across the boards.

It's called stat scaling. Use it. If you join a bg and you're lower level at least scale the stats up as if you were &quot;highest&quot; level for that bg. Add a few more fluff to it by &quot;bumping&quot; your stats up if your gear sucks. All they need is a baseline to work around. Look at bg 10-14 or whatever level range it is, if you join that bg as a scrub you're at around 200-300hp at most. Other people will be close to 1k or even over it. That is a HUGE problem caused by... GEAR. Just scale the stats of lower level/poorly geared players to a baseline. Then again... they won't fool anyone. The PvP is just as shitty at highest level.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sturzengel</div><div class="date">2011-08-13, 10:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's cute how everyone thinks the problem with low-level pvp is gear-related. If gear was the only problem, there wouldn't really be a problem. It'd be &quot;shut up and learn how to gear yourself, it's not hard, even for newbies.&quot;But it's not about gear, it's about ability scaling. Specifically, some numbers are too high. For example, ambush by a sub rogue. Avenger's shield (since it also silences and dazes with glyph!), aim shot, ice shield. These are the main culprits, there are a couple of others. The thing that bothers me the most is that they completely redesigned class mechanics so they could avoid this problem and fix it easily if need be. Everything plugs into a formula of scaling now, it would take roughly 2 days of fixing at the most to get Ambush where it should be (completely untouched at lvl 85). This is quite discouraging, because while I understand that low-level matters are secondary, the fact that such an easy fix is too much work for these people makes me think that their priorities are in the wrong place, and who knows what will suffer as a result down the road!</div></div><hr />

Increasing queue times? Leaving heirloom players with seemingly never-ending queue times? Instead of whining about it, you could be farming your own heirlooms, and twinking out your own characters.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I laugh when people say something like this. Did you know you basically need a level 85 character on that server in order to acquire heirlooms? What if you're new to the game or want to reroll from scratch on another server?<br />
<br />
I did this once. I queued up as a level 14 hunter with no heirloom gear and our team got absolutely facerolled by a group of 3 heirloomed hunters and 1 heirloomed disc priest. This wasn't being &quot;outclassed&quot; or &quot;outplayed&quot;. It was an absolute massacre at the GY of WSG. As soon as someone spawned they were dead. No chance and no way out. I can assure you that if I were a new player and experienced that I would never, EVER want to Pvp again.<br />
<br />
I don't mind people having an advantage with better gear but there is a difference between an advantage and completely overwhelming and dominating your opponent. And these advantages are given to them just because they have a level 85 character (or had an 80 in the past) and acquired some gear by grinding BG's or heroics? <br />
<br />
And even if you do have two teams of fully heirloom geared players it's basically the first one to hit the opponent wins. Well, that is if you're a hunter, rogue, feral druid, warrior, enhance shaman, or paladin. Casters may as well just stand at the graveyard when they get one shot by any rogue who happens to be camping out the middle of the BG. <br />
<br />
So anyways, try it out for yourself. Go make yourself a warlock or mage on a new server, level it all the way to 19, acquire what gear you can through questing and dungeons and let me know how you do against a fully heirloom geared hunter or rogue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dungeon and Chain quests can put blues in every slot that are just about as good as heirlooms, not at lvl 19 necessarily, but no one's looking for balance that low (let rogue and hunter noobs have their fun imo). Also, at level 60 and above heirlooms become less and less important with pvp gear and better itemized drops/rewards. Hell, by lvl 70 if you're wearing more than one heirloom it means you're not even trying to gear, and will probably be stomped in a bg.<br />
<br />
The issue is ability scaling, something Bliz just refuses to admit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
untill now I've just been a &quot;bystander&quot; on these forums, but since I thought a bit about these new patch notes,<br />
I would like to share my opinion with all of you on this,<br />
in my first ever MMO-Champ post!<br />
(wiii go me lol :) )<br />
<br />
Feel free to give me any constructive (!) criticism about anything (typo, thought, bad layout because this still is my first post, etc, English isn't my first language).<br />
<br />
Let it be open for debate ! (Aka, let the games begin!)<br />
<br />
NO FLAMING / TROLLING please, if you could watch this thread a bit more closely Mod's i would really, really appreciate it, since i'm kinda putting alot of effort into it :).<br />
<br />
It's really &quot;frightening&quot; lately tbh, yes, i do use ranseur, and yes, i socket pure resi, and yes, theres a 80% chance that i'm going for the polearm, instead of the axe (but the axe looks so cool imo lol), since Ranseur alone gives 3.26 crit, polearm will give 3.50%+ then i presume? + it looks cool aswell (T2, hope i'll get there, wish me luck yet again ! lol),<br />
and not every other warrior runs around with it :).<br />
The frightening part, however, is the brutality people have these days.<br />
You have normal brutality : &quot;hah you socket fer tank you noob&quot;, &quot;hah, you use hunter weap, you a huntard?&quot; etc<br />
You have way bigger brutality (1 guy, yeah, you, you're damn lucky i don't report you to Blizz, because if i played it &quot;nasty&quot;, i could probably get you a ban with the things you said and circumstances). This was basically a 2k+ player i think, saying, i should not waste my time and other people's times with making any guide if I even can't break 1550 in 3s and 5s, that i'm a scrub and i need to L2P.<br />
Did i ever say i was &quot;the baws&quot;? No, i'm not, imo Tankz is (yes, i used to watch your stream sometimes in Wotlk, loved your choppin' moves hehe)<br />
I do know &quot;some&quot; other good warriors (did watch videos and stuff) but the only one i can think of / remember is Hoodrch atm, and Xannadu (friend of mine from Auch).<br />
There's alot more, those are just the ones with highest ratings that i &quot;know&quot; :).<br />
I did learn alot from you guys (girls? Tankzy? :p) as junior rawrior, and i hope you might find something usefull back in this guide.<br />
If not, i hope you can add anything usefull (you get credit for it offcourse) and help us (and me) improve :).<br />
I'm not asking you gladiators to stream e very match you do, to give us every keybinding that you use (i won't do that myself either, <br />
i am however willing to post a pic of my UI, give you all my macros (66 lol) and send you the powerauras thingies / moveanything thingies.<br />
<br />
But that will probably be in guide nr 2, Pvp and You : The Way of the Rawrior, depending on how usefull people find this one.<br />
<br />
And yeah, I admit, my gear looks funky at first, but if you don't know warriors and don't know how they work, keep your &quot;noobish&quot; comments to yourself please,<br />
i would like to play the way I like to play, and not how you think i should :). This setup works for me (since i need prot gear too, using same gear eh).<br />
And with buying Ranseur i save 3400 points for now, opening a window of ruth thrown / shield first :).<br />
A lil &quot;story&quot; about me :<br />
<br />
- I'm an old Vanilla player, but i have been coming and going to wow (mostly in the summer, cause sun &gt; wow, or when &quot;real life&quot; was too busy).<br />
<br />
- Due to personal reasons, i have alot of free time on my hands atm, and i'm spending it on WoW (also due to those personal reasons.)<br />
<br />
- I've allways been more of a dragonslayer and a bg-hero kinda guy in the past, never really liked arena all that much,<br />
because (in my opinion ==&gt; CLARIFICATION on this: My Opinion is my opinion, as every human being has a right to have their own opinion,<br />
as long as you say it in a nice and polite manner, and that you're open for constructive criticism and discussion, YOU have it TOO :) );<br />
*because* imo (there it is again lol) arena is just more comp based and zerg based (train the clothie till it dies as melee anyone? works on lower ratings).<br />
<br />
- I did raid alot in Vanilla (as a Resto Drood untill Instructor Razuvious in Naxx40 (that's the first boss in there, wasn't that hard imo)<br />
TBC =&gt; untill Illidan, &amp; in WotLK i helped (or tried to lol) lead a guild as an officer ( =&gt; Ambiguity, which disbanded now I think 'cause of slack meh) <br />
doing both 10 and 25's in ICC (normals and trying to get enough people for HM's, did get 10/12 HC in 10 man, did some bosses i think without full 30% buff)<br />
(didn't play during Ulduar / beginning of TotC, because Naxx really was way too easy + boring afther a while,<br />
and having to have to run it alot (!) of times for Journey's End (went Feral on my Druid in early TBC / late Vanilla),<br />
then having a Hunter getting it because &quot;it's a major upgrade man&quot; is just lol ... <br />
What do you think it is for me? a stick to scratch my back with when i'm teh fluffy form? lol<br />
<br />
It is actually an upgrade for you, mr Hunter, I know that, but if i follow your logic, next time I'm in a raid with you on my Warrior,<br />
I can roll on your agi bows / guns / crossbows amirite? (Don't get me started on your precious agi rings / necks etc with no crap haste on it like the str ones, <br />
I myself use Matoclaw's Band (365) and the 378 ring from VP points, just cause that 378 ring gives mastery and crit, the reforge possibilities on that are just insane.)<br />
My point for this being, where has the &quot;courtesy&quot; gone in WoW? <br />
For example, in Vanilla Wow, there was a &quot;drood&quot; code (crazy alamo started it i think lol, his addon still makes me giggle), where druids from the same server,<br />
alli or horde, just wouldn't kill each other, we liked /purring more!<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and I do use Ranseur aswell (normal offc, since i don't have any reliable pve pug / steady group (on X day) (yet i hope :p),<br />
just because of the stupid amount of reforge possibilities again (minus 100 haste to 100 hit =&gt; yes, you do lose resi there, and str, which is valuable AP <br />
(and parry for teh tankz amongst us), which is generally like a bad idea! , but i gladly suffer a 400 str loss if i gain stats like that<br />
(i know haste isn't exactly a good stats for arms wars, but the leftover haste on ranseur / pants makes my 3.6 weap go to a 3.52 weap,<br />
which ain't bad, considering you get it for free (it's just there :p).<br />
And that 400 str loss gets covered by apparatus (if you can afford it that is offcourse).<br />
I just tried a different reforging / gearing / gemming / maybe talents &amp; glyphs then most warriors, and i must say i find it most enjoyable.<br />
I make sure i get the hit cap and the &quot;exp cap&quot; (5% dodge, and i'm alli, so i don't have to worry about them nightelves :p),<br />
and the agi weap then gives me the precious agility i lack in my gearsetup (since i can use this gear setup for both fc'ing and arms in pvp,<br />
with just shielding up and changing 1 trinket (i have loads of trinkets for that one slot, was a human before, but nightelf &gt; human by far imo :).<br />
I preffer utility over the 1 more pve trinket possibility, but with my gear setup, i'm using apparatus, just like you (if you have it lol).<br />
Your resi? probably a little bit lower then mine (if i don't use apparatus, and go with the on use str trink) <br />
=&gt; vicious now, might upgrade that one first to ruthless, or the battlemaster one, still doubting, 20k hp increase (more with last stand if you pop it together,<br />
but you allready have a 30 % increase on a 3 min cd, which lasts 20 sec) vs more &quot;burst&quot; (prot burst lolol, even though i'm purely specced for survival / annoyance)<br />
but it also gives probly like 3 - 4% parry, so i'll have to &quot;brainstorm&quot; about that decision lol, help me out !<br />
I also have the mastery / on use 406 resistance trink from TB (359 one, 125 marks), but at the moment, it doesn't seem to do anything in pvp whatsoever.<br />
My point being, is agi the best stat for a warrior (to like gem fully for it etc) ==&gt; not at all.<br />
Some slots are just handy to get that crit from (imo), I myself am getting the 359 crossbow now (over the str 359 thrown),<br />
because A) you can enchant it with the 800 ranged ap thing (lol),<br />
B) the first shot does more damage, C) it will (hopefully) give me enough crit to go from 9.70% with only Battle Shout, to 10% + :),<br />
while still maintaining alot of resi / hit / exp / mastery and a real cool meta gem (best one for warriors imo, since we suck vs those 2 :p).<br />
And D) the crossbow just looks real cool lol, didn't check out the ruthless one yet, but the 359 one looks real cool.<br />
<br />
(I did finally get Journey's End in the end (see what i did there, lol) though, only for Ulduar to release soon afther and making it obsolete again :&gt;).<br />
<br />
- I did do PvP during all 3 expansions, on 3 different chars:<br />
<br />
=&gt; &quot;Alt&quot; 72 Lock with Knight-Lieutenant (Vanilla players will remember how overpowered Lock's were back then lol, no matter your gear).<br />
=&gt; 80 Druid with 15.5k / 21k in WsG for Justicar, Master Sergeant and some arena achi's i think (nothing high).<br />
=&gt; My current main, Nicolasrage, a Rawrior ( On Auchindoun EU Alliance), who I rerolled to in early WotLk<br />
(around Jan - Feb 2010 I think, should check my achi's).<br />
I have been PvP'ing &quot;on her&quot; since lvl 10, and loved it from the start (i'm 1 achi away from Battlemaster on my Warrior (Stormpike Perfection), and 1750 achi in 2s).<br />
Since I love BG'ing with her, I did join a pvp guild on Auchindoun (You are a Joke) like 1 month ago-ish (when i restarted wow, and &quot;officially&quot; started cata).<br />
I would like to try and complete as many PvP achievements in the game, as i never really achi-hunted before, just doing some of the fun ones on the way :).<br />
And thats what this game is all about imo, having fun while you're doing whatever stuff you do in wow :)<br />
And in my opinion, since this season (and since something happened (i won't elaborate on this, since people will automatically, without actually willing to do it, have pitty with you, and i allready get that enough from some factors in my &quot;real life&quot;, and i'm just sick of it, trying to stay positive is way harder like that;<br />
so i would like if you just didn't ask anything about it, if it's the same for you :) thanks in advance for this).<br />
So, since this season, i have this sudden urge, to stop pvping for just fun with friends (like, making sure that mage kills himself on your spellreflect,<br />
draw games out 50% longer till he dies on the reflect no matter what, things like that lol), and to start pvping with the goal of getting as far as I can get, but while still having fun (meeting 3 counters in a row in arena, and raging, just because X class does Y and you go *poof* dead, just isn't fun anymore).<br />
I've been messing around for 3 whole days (with little to no sleep, yawn) with my ui / macros / specs / gems / reforging / and now i think i finally found what i need :).<br />
<br />
You probably ask yourself now, why does this dude talk so much, i don't need to know all this stuff, get to the good part !<br />
<br />
Well, i just wanted to &quot;quickly&quot; (hum) introduce myself and give you a little background about me, because i would like to be taken seriously<br />
(no reactions like &quot;lololol you don't even have 1550 in 3s scrub, gtfo&quot; or whatever, please).<br />
I by no means am claiming to be &quot;super 1337&quot;, i'm just really getting into pvp this Expansion (it needs some tweeking, more on that to come !).<br />
I think balance, however, is real nice atm (except some, again, patience young padawanapprentice! lol).<br />
And i just wanted to let you guys know that you can copy a gladiators spec, but that you don't have to, and when you mess around with it as much as i did, you might find something you really, really like :).<br />
Just trying to give my 2 cents to &quot;the community&quot;, maybe even real high ranked players might find something usefull about it, or enlighten me on stuff i forgot / don't know yet.<br />
<br />
=&gt; Like for instance, i didn't know what a Dk's Dark Simulaecrum (or however its written :p) existed, till my gladiatorlosa suddenly said it, looked it up on wowhead, <br />
and, i was like astonished ...<br />
Why do you nerf our spellreflect by 15 sec (10 sec with glyph) to a total of 25 / 20 sec if i may ask, it's really just improved SR with a longer CD. <br />
Don't get me wrong, i don't want to have DS, but i would like a 20 sec baseline spellreflect, and 15 sec with glyph, not overpowered at all if you ask me.<br />
(And still a nerf, since it was 10 sec in WotLK, and 10 sec is too short of a cd for a spell that powerfull.)<br />
And what happens if a mage (with legendary staff) sheeps you, and you reflect the first, what happens to that &quot;duplicate&quot; spell? you eat it, or it gets reflected too, or?<br />
<br />
=&gt; With this gear setup, i do find my damage lacking somewhat when i have 0 stacks of slaughter, or when CS is on cd against plate targets, you don't get a proc and<br />
your mortal strikes get parried / dodged / blocked / missed, so you don't have 3 stacks of Slaughter again (since you don't get a stack then).<br />
Solution? imo, either up CS from 50% armor reduct to 70% armor reduct (maybe only for mail / plate targets, if that is possible? leave it on 50% for cloth / leather),<br />
or up our damage without slaughter ( 0 stacks) , make the slaughter buff apply anyway, even when it gets parried or whatever, but make us have 2 stacks max, not 3.<br />
(Does sound like a nice change here, we win some we lose some, and clothies win some too (our dmg should drop on them, seriously,<br />
priest and drood healers rly die quite fast if you time everything right and use your cd's properly, because hello thar 3 stacks slaughter + reck / Deadly Calm + Sweeping Strikes,<br />
and i'm not even mentioning trinket use here.<br />
<br />
=&gt; Is there something wrong with Pummel, or is it just me playing wireless + not having a top notch computer, but if i don't pummel (same with spell reflect) on 3/4th off the cast,<br />
the cast still goes off, only for my target to get the debuff while i am sitting in that sheep (has some very clunky situational uses though, like doing it on purpose on a mage<br />
when he sheeps, so he eats a 3 sec silence, you eat a 3 sec poly (more hp nomnom), your trinket is ready / dispelling healer, but it doesn't allways work due to clunkyness lol. <br />
Then, when I'm reflecting, for instance, a cyclone,<br />
only to eat it for 6 seconds, while i see my SR going 5-4-3-2-1-poof.<br />
It mostly bugs on only cyclone lately tbh (can't remember the last time it bugged on anything else, i could of missed it though, anyone?),<br />
since that cast is 0.5 sec faster due to the PVP gloves for moonkins, pummel doesn't know what to do with it, he's still learning, like we all are!<br />
It probably is my latency + fact i play wireless + no top notch comp that give me this, which is rather annoying lol.<br />
You learn to adapt and live with it i presume (if that would be the case that it is all caused purely due to my comp setup and wireless<br />
(i do have a Quadcore, but one of the first and quite sucky ones, my motherboard sawks (it sometimes bugs giving strange noices and total freezes with grey ish lil cubes &gt;_&gt;<br />
It kinda sucked hard one night, i wanted to raize my cap a bit (i was 35 short for weap this week, since i started a month ago, i am (soon was i hope) behind lol.<br />
Didn't have 1500 + RBG yet (i do have 1511 atm, but that still doesn't raize anything i think :p), so i asked a good friend (ret pala) to join me on my adventures in 2s.<br />
We did 31-14, but out of those 45 games, we had like 10 games where either of us would dc (its luckily better now, using less addons because i have to, and lowered<br />
the spelleffects to low / lowest :&gt;).<br />
<br />
Warriors allways, and will allways struggle with being kited like hell, and with my spec (no piercing howl), if your hamstring gets dodged or so,<br />
its not really fun (good thing its on a very easy button and i can spam it real fast + that i have improved hamstring (1/2 tho, no points left for 2/2)).<br />
Thats why i would suggest for this, make piercing howl baseline (and remove talent point? / replace it with what?),<br />
and do something with the hamstring talent perhaps, so we can't root no more? (5 sec root followed by 5 sec stun, 2 silences, a shadowmeld (nelf &lt;3) if its vs a caster (or stealthers lol, you vanish (with a &quot;pro&quot; Heroic leap be4 the shadowmeld can be done too, use meld the sec you land, and its like a ranged vanish :&gt;,<br />
it's real nice to use in any pvp situation), so i vanish too lol, but you have rend on yourself, and my charge is ready, and vs a caster (as i was saying) its a tad overpowered too, if you use meld for fears / hexes / clones / sheeps and so on.<br />
its like just a bit too much, and its the 5 sec root imo<br />
make it so the talent stays, and it reduces gcd still with 0.25 / 0.50, but no more root (maybe add in something funny, or put -2.5 / 5 sec cd reduct on reflect there?)<br />
you lose the root, but you gain piercing howl (just remove this talentpoint completely, and maybe make it into a 1 pointer: Reduces the Cooldown on your Heroic Leap by 10 sec, and your Charge / intercept by 1 sec ? just a thought, but a little faster leapin' wouldn't be op (1 min vs 50 sec), and how often don't you find yourself with 1-2 sec cd on charge, not being able to interrupt that spell? (i don't have room for the 1 sec charge glyph, but you could maybe make it reduce the cd on charge by 1.5 instead of 1, <br />
then i would use that glyph i think :p and if you do nr 2, the 1 pointer talent from piercing howl (which is now gone) will be<br />
Removes the Cd on your Heroic Leap by X sec (i propose 10 to 15 max).<br />
the Fury talent that reduces the cd on heroic leap should need to be changed accordingly tho, its just, fury has 2 intercepts (longer cd tho then Charge) and a 40 sec leap (i think?),<br />
and for arms its a Charge on a relatively short CD yeah (13 sec with talents that everybody takes anyway), i would love for that one to be either 12 (change glyph of charge into:<br />
you can now no longer jump my charges like a baws! (just a joke tbh, but it could work lol, since that bug could use fixing, but i find it challenging to time my charges so they land on the ground when i reach them, so they can't jump me as good anymore as like for instance 6 months ago :). Like this you have the option to either :<br />
A) glyph for the charge (if you have wireless / crappy laptop / crappy pc) with high latency<br />
B) don't glyph for charge, live with the fact that good players will baws you from time to time, you can't root them anymore, but atleast you have piercing howl now, 10 yards range tho, glyph gets removed! (15 yards aoe slow baseline is just ... you know)<br />
<br />
Sorry that i'm back in your face so fast and hurtin' you, the way of the rawrior is the way of the rawrior! <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
These are 5 &quot;changes&quot; that came to mind for warriors for me, feel free to add any good ones, for ANY CLASS !<br />
(if they really are not good (overpowered / we are still Wow Chars, not supermen - or women / whatever) just please delete them instantly, so it doesn't become a trollfest. <br />
<br />
<br />
About the 10 - 15 - 25 man raiding : <br />
I really think this is a great idea, put alot of thought into it, and i hope you guys like it:<br />
<br />
You now have 10 and 25 man normal modes<br />
You now have 25 man hardmodes<br />
you now have 12.(5) man hardmodes !!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Meaning, you get your &quot;regular) 10 man normal setup, you get (MANDATORY) an extra tank in, and an extra healer in (will this fix LFD a bit? i think so)<br />
And now you are probably thinking, do we bring a 13th, that just gives the mobs a knucklesandwich or 3 (can't equip a weap)?<br />
That would be fun, i admit, but no lol.<br />
<br />
In some of the HM encounters, you have the option to either:<br />
A) get a tank, that has 175k hp, has tanking abilities that he automatically uses, is not buffable, and causes 50% threat of a normal tank's threat (in the gear lvl appropriate for that raid). All chars have an additional 2 options : like for tanking its either 1) Aoe taunt every 15-20 sec? (these are just suggestions, you can make encounters where like<br />
for example little adds keep spawning every x sec, he aoe taunts, gets all the mobs on him, the 3 tanks have to taunt it back within 2-3 sec, or the lil one probly won't make it :P)<br />
or 2) an Interrupt<br />
B) a healer, 150k hp, same as above (heals automatically, etc, but only for 50% of the healing), has the option to either be 1) a more HoT based healer<br />
or 2) be a more casting - healer based friend!<br />
C) a melee dps, 150k hp, 50% dmg, 1) an interrupt or 2) 5% crit / haste buff (depending on which is missing)<br />
and D) a caster, 150k hp, 50% dmg, 1) good aoe damage (still 50%) or 2) Heroism<br />
<br />
I really like this idea tbh, it needs tweeking offcourse, but it's a start i think, since people do keep saying 10 HM is easy compared to 25 HM<br />
(i have no clue, i just heard this, please correct me if i'm wrong).<br />
<br />
And then the final proposal (for now, more to come) is for<br />
<br />
BH :<br />
<br />
We all know the trade spams : /2 X has ninjaed X, Y is a ninja guild, etc etc<br />
It's a known fact, i don't mind picking up the pve gear at all, but if there is for instance another warr in the 25 man group, i will ask him if he is here mainly for pve / pvp.<br />
If he says pve, its &quot;profit&quot; for both, because if pvp warrior gear drops, it'll probs go to me (unless there is yet another war in the group or so, or its not tier gear), and if the pve items drop, he will get what he came for mainly :).<br />
<br />
So why not implement some sort of system, that lets 12/13 pve people (ilvl 353+?) and 12/13 pvp people (min full 365?) group up, and go do BH? He is so easy it's laughable, and i mean (i haven't tested it yet), i think, if i use my 353+ pve gear, or my pvp gear with some reforges to get 8% hit and 26 expertise (imagine a warrior in full t2 with t2 weap joining in on a bh run, wars gem for expertise in their pve gear anyway (some use the tier 378 pants with expertise even so), that i would probably outdamage my pve gear, which isn't bad at all (3 pieces 359, valor offset pieces etc, 2 353, ...).<br />
The Stat difference is just so huge, the str gain alone would probably net the upper hand.<br />
<br />
And you could allways &quot;tune&quot; Bh, so that it needs 5% hit, and 20 expertise as a melee to be able to enter as pvp gear (in pve you have 8 &amp; 26 so)<br />
<br />
You can still join BH normal, like it is now, if you just spam trade and make the group yourself.<br />
<br />
There is, however, a new tool, *BH-Tool*. You can only open it when your faction has BH (this tool is server-based aswell offcourse).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PVP PVE<br />
SPEC 1 MS SPEC 1 MS<br />
SPEC 2 OS SPEC 2 OS<br />
<br />
3rd option is whatever you would like, if no one else wants it (doesn't really need to be there, but a feral druid (pvp ms, pve kitty, can put resto as 3 then or so?)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now quickly, some more thoughts on the patch notes, and then its enough for one day, a man has to play some bgs too ya know :).<br />
<br />
on the Helm / Shoulders matter:<br />
<br />
Yes, its annoying you can't have 4 set 359 (which is outdated anyway), bcause the set bonusses have allways been real nice :) (3% more ap for wars for example)<br />
Why not (going on a limb here) make it so that:<br />
<br />
A) you can buy helm and shoulders for 800 VP each (doing 6 hcs ish, and nearly a weekly cap on the vp points, since some pve people &quot;complain&quot; that pvp people or people with less time can gear up as fast as them (which isn't true, we don't do Firelands (as much), we only get the VP points Gear, you get Firelands gear too,<br />
but like this it will take non-&quot;hardcore&quot; pve'ers / pvpers a little longer to fully gear up, since we don't get as much Firelands gear as you + that, i think it should suffice.<br />
Don't forget the fact you can just do (probably cool) bosses in Firelands, while I (for instance) am forced to do 6 ZA / ZG and BH for the same amount of vp points). <br />
And, when you reach 4 set, you cannot buy the 5th for JP or VP anymore (will give an error: allready 4 pieces tier X equipped).<br />
You have to go get it in the respective dungeon / raid (only that final piece).<br />
People who are happy with 4 359 (and 2 set bonuses wii) and some 353 piece from ZA/ ZG, go ahead, be happy !<br />
Those who want to &quot;push&quot; their stats, and get 5/5 (it might be better or not, depending on the stats, got no clue whatsoever here)<br />
can still do it, those who rather just gear up &quot;fully&quot; and go do firelands, can do so aswell.<br />
<br />
B) Just make it like before, where there were 2) 3) and 5) sets<br />
You can still not buy helm / shoulders from anything (not even VP here, or? since you have 4 set then yeah, but 4 doesn't give a bonus anymore, so hmm).<br />
But you will get 3 pieces of 359 from JP, and those 3 pieces will grant not 1, but 2 setbonuses. If you have all 5, you &quot;unlock&quot; the major one, which is now number 4<br />
You can add anything on places 2 or 3, i would put it on 2), and make it a utility-kinda-something.<br />
Example: you could make it so that the 2) &quot;prepares&quot; people for Tier378, like for instance, i think Warrior Tier378 gives + % dmg if you use Battle shout for X sec.<br />
You could make the 2) set : Increases the rage generated by your battle / commanding shout by 10.<br />
And make the current 2 set the 3) set, and the current 4) set the 5)set - bonus.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The matter of Character slots / only 2 specs / Lower lvl PvP<br />
<br />
<br />
In my Opinion, i would like to see these 2 first things changed, but hear me out first.<br />
We have 2 specs, which is allready imba, but if you're a hybrid (and poor droods) it kinda is annoying.<br />
I have the chance that i now have 2 specs taht both work in pvp and in pve, with using nearly the same glyphs.<br />
But not every other class / spec has that.<br />
+ I don't have room for any fury pve or pvp spec (i would like to try fury pvp, and fury pve &gt; arms dps wize so).<br />
Why not make it 3?<br />
but MAX 3<br />
not 4 in 2 years<br />
3 forever and ever and ever + 1 ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Char slots the same, they are 10 now, make them 12 imo, but, it ain't NEVER gonna be 13, so don't bother asking, 12 forever :).<br />
(and then maybe put a limit on acc chars instead of realm chars?)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I would like to clarify something, i am going somewhere with all of this you know, it all has a purpose :p.<br />
<br />
I think(and alot of vanilla players will probably aggree with me) that the current server population is beyond .... (insert whatever word you want here, some spring to mind).<br />
<br />
Do I, as a 24 year old, mind that there are A*** spam jokes 24/7 in Trade (you know which ones)? Euhm offcourse i do, trade is for trading, if you want to spam your ****,<br />
why are you doing it on wow? Real life says hi, Real **** there, omg, nowai?<br />
Yes wai =&gt; My proposal<br />
<br />
I don't want to be surrounded by any 12-17 year olds anymore then they want to be surrounded by me.<br />
They love to laugh at each other, looking at each other's behind n stuff, i'll never get it, maybe it's been too long for me.<br />
<br />
==&gt; Make 18+ / 20+ servers and normal servers, not real hard to link your age to your acc when logging in (i think? i'm not a programmer).<br />
The normal servers, just call them troll servers, they'll love it ! lol<br />
There are adult restriction on cd's from bloody every rap band to just give one example.<br />
So why is it, that there is no real feel of vanilla left anymore.<br />
I just feel i'm surrounded by kids, who call me a scrub and just don't stop with trying to be a smartypants (but in a really rude way).<br />
Is it me, or do parents cba to teach their kids moral values, kindness and politeness?<br />
<br />
I really like whats going on in Cata, things are really looking nicely imo, balancing has never been better imo (offcourse, its far from done, but is it ever done?)<br />
<br />
IF X class doesn't counter Y class just a little bit, then whats the fun in even dueling, and trying to find ways to stay on your target, or avoid incoming damage<br />
while you wait to be face to face with your opponent again. ( I would love to trade in some of my dmg (like in my suggestion) for a little more utility ).<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents for now, sleepy<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
ROOM FOR EDITING, and yes, Wall of Text will probably crit you for 20k+, no matter your resi ! lol<br />
There's still loads to come, but need a lil break atm, my eyes ...<br />
<br />
Didn't do full layout yet, too lazy, and have to read if i didn't forget anything, but theres alot to read, please read it, tell me what you find good and bad about it, etc, thanks :).<br />
<br />
Update nr 1: i didn't add in the Warrior Pvp Guide yet that i wold like to make (pure pvp guide), since it can be easily made on AJ (ArenaJunkies), if every 2.4k + warrior does 1 thing (X does 5 macros, Y does 5, Z explains addons, W teaches the ways of &quot;bawsing&quot;, etc, lol, you get the picture.<br />
I would like to help there, but A) i can't post there (yet again, hope remains), since you need X rating (2.2 ./ 2.4 ?), and theres alot of warriors out there who have been around for 6+ years, my nelfy is only 1 and a half years old so, they can probably / likely make it better then me.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, was thinking about doing that, but since most of my post is about the patch notes anyway, and its still under construction, i'm not really sure where to put it.<br />

Mod's, feel free to put it wherever you want, just as long as i can find it again lol, its more or less done, not much time this week to sit behind a pc anyway, layout will have to do unless someone wants to mess with it lol<br />
<br />
And why hasn't anybody replied here yet, i thought MMO-Champ got atleast some visitors (that would see this and would want to reply),<br />
or just anything constructive, so i know i didn't make all of this just cause it might look pretty on paper if i make a nice layout?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cows For Life</div><div class="date">2011-08-15, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dungeon and Chain quests can put blues in every slot that are just about as good as heirlooms, not at lvl 19 necessarily, but no one's looking for balance that low (let rogue and hunter noobs have their fun imo). Also, at level 60 and above heirlooms become less and less important with pvp gear and better itemized drops/rewards. Hell, by lvl 70 if you're wearing more than one heirloom it means you're not even trying to gear, and will probably be stomped in a bg.<br />
<br />
The issue is ability scaling, something Bliz just refuses to admit.<br />
<br />
Are there still people that think heirlooms are the main problem with low level PVP? (and by low I mean below 60)<br />
<br />
I'd probably place it at #5. Although admittedly, it is pretty sick to see a player in a mix of quest and dungeon gear at 400 HP while someone with heirlooms and enchants has 1200.<br />
<br />
#1 Would be damage and healing from abilities is very out of whack between classes and on top of that virtually no one has any defensive abilities, spells, or cooldowns available.<br />
<br />
Hunters and rogues have very high DPS and they can front load a ton of it with instant cast abilities = tons of front loaded damage. (Remember MM hunters with 100% ArP at the end of WotLK or ret paladins at the start?) Good luck trying to counter or stop instant attacks with your LOS in WSG or AB hah! Hunters also have the biggest range of anyone...<br />
<br />
Discipline priests have powerful instant dots that do lots of damage and very high healing throughput which the other healers can only dream of. They're also one of the few classes that can survive a hunter siege but that's only because their dots, bubbles, and heals are even more overpowered at low levels.<br />
<br />
#2 Level 60 enchants.<br />
<br />
Having DPS and stamina enchants meant for level 60 endgame is pretty game-breaking at low levels. Heirlooms just exacerbate this problem since the great expense only needs to be done once. No new player can compete with this yet they're thrown into the same system. The system could be finer grained here, eg limiting 225-299 enchants to level 40 and up, 300 to level 50 and up etc.<br />
<br />
#3 abilities.<br />
<br />
Looking at the list of abilities on WowHead, it seems that Blizzard has done a poor job here even though they re-did the whole thing. One of the big grievances I have read about is that below level 25, a hunter could kite someone just by holding the S key and using CS on cooldown. That's just wrong.<br />
<br />
#4 players exploiting the queue system<br />
<br />
I used to see this a lot and I'm aware that the problem might even be worse now. Players that go into BG's solely to stomp on people that have no chance to fight back. You see this in people who have full heirlooms and full level 60 enchants going into a BG and wiping out all of the 500 hp players at level 14 or 19 then dropping out of the BG before it ends to avoid the bulk of XP gain. They do this to maximize the amount of time they get to stomp undergeared players and saddest part is they delete their characters once they level to start a new hunter or rogue.</div></div><hr />
