Addon - Flash Taskbar<br />
Flash Taskbar (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/flash-taskbar) is a simple addon that uses the FlashClientIcon() feature added in Patch 6.2 to flash the client in your taskbar for ready checks, queues, and other important events. This makes it easier to tab out of the game without missing your queue!<br />
<br />

ArenaNet recently announced (http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/23/guild-wars-2-hits-7-million-players-as-expansion-launches) that Guild Wars 2 has reached a total of 7 million accounts globally. <br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Is there such thing as overwhelming content opposed to lots of choices? Is it design flaw for dailies to turn in to chores?<br />
So many developers turn to replaying a thing to get more life out of it. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/655404965997842432))<br />
So i have been just wondering why game houses are so slow to expand and increase output and what could be done to increase it<br />
Hiring is very slow, especially if you care about your studio's culture. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/655408824044556289))<br />
For example there is a global shortage of effects artists right now. We just can't hire as many as we need. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/655409119831068672))<br />
I'll throw out this Q to everyone: What games have you played for a long time that didn't recycle or reuse levels, dungeons, etc.? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/655409470718107648))<br />
In other words, is it even possible for a studio to produce content faster than players can consume it? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/655409604193488896))<br />
Procedural content (say Age of Empires random maps or Diablo random dungeons) may be one approach. Are there others? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/655409772695416832))<br />

Computers - Setup of the Month<br />
Each month or so we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
The current SSD prices (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/october/ssdgraph.gif?v2) are fairly flat right now, with most SSDs under $0.50 per gigabyte when on sale. <br />
<br />
New CPUs from Intel and GPUs from AMD are here, but they aren't huge improvements over the previous generation. <br />
<br />
Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VKVZ1A?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002VKVZ1A). <br />
<br />
Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or streaming, you do not need the 6700K and should spend that money elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date.<br />
<br />

I guess technically because GW2 is B2P, all accounts are active in the sense that they're activated. Not so much active in the sense that they're...active.</div></div><hr />

it used to be B2p. now you can get the base game for free - with some restrictions, but they are relatively minor all things concidered</div></div><hr />

Much more than 100,000 - every single zone is pretty much perma full during prime time on GW2.</div></div><hr />

Yes well maybe if you at least knew something about GW2 you'd realize it's running on megaservers.<br />

If that's true so what? Game would probably feel populated and be fine with 10k active.<br />

With every expansion, you buy the main game as well. Thus you get a second account. It's on the &quot;How to make your game appear more popular than it is&quot; rulebook too.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Guess&quot; being the most accurate word here. You really would have no idea, especially since they instance their areas once they fill up.<br />

I do know something about Guild Wars 2, I play it daily. And the mega server is split into different zone instances, there are multiple instances of every single zone in Guild Wars 2, one zone fills up and they simply create a new instance and start funneling people there instead.<br />

We call these blizzfanboys who think they know what they are talking about. You don't even understand how the megaservers actually works.... Always looking for a way to attack other games with no knowledge. GW2 before they made the core free stated they had over 4.1 million ACTIVE players that had logged on within the month they raised the statistics. Now that the core is free and the expansion is out it doesn't surprise me that they hit 7 million I mean obviously it will likely die down. But their are more active players in GW2 than WoW. Not don't get me wrong I like WoW i started playing in patch 1.3 with the release of WSG. But the game has been steadily dying since Cata and are down to 5 million players. I have no doubt that when next expansion goes live they will shoot back up several million like they always do. That's the way it works in every game.</div></div><hr />

Holy shit. Dungeon Dan is now partially REAL. Not only that, but he has alt tab function! Even if you could run WoW in windowed mode already, so you could hear the sounds from the game... That's just pathetic. And I bet they changed code to allow for this on purpose.<br />
<br />
Edit: pathetic, in the funny sense, and also as in showing the state of the game. The mindset created by designer's decisions, and the community. People talking about being relieved to get stuff rather than happy - something I can recall feeling in MOP before quitting. And apparently now, not enough content to keep people from alt tabbing a ton.<br />
<br />
Every day, more things that say, &quot;Yup, not coming back.&quot;</div></div><hr />

GW2 was never advertised as a WoW killer, you can blame it's over hyped (former) player base for that. If you want to bash and denounce a game as a WoW Killer, RIFT is that way &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />

I think fundamentally the real (and largely unsolvable) problem is that online games have to keep you on the hook. I mean I am all for getting your money's worth out of a game and I frequently blast Blizz for not delivering enough things to keep me logging in everyday.. But the chief design of basically every online game is 'keep them playing (and ideally paying) forever.' It's an unrealistic goal, the human condition is what it is. You could have a game with unlimited content and be completely free and still people would inevitably get bored and leave.</div></div><hr />

You don't even understand how the megaservers actually works.... Always looking for a way to attack other games with no knowledge. GW2 before they made the core free stated they had over 4.1 million ACTIVE players that had logged on within the month they raised the statistics. <br />
<br />
Now that the core is free and the expansion is out it doesn't surprise me that they hit 7 million I mean obviously it will likely die down. But their are more active players in GW2 than WoW. Not don't get me wrong I like WoW i started playing in patch 1.3 with the release of WSG. But the game has been steadily dying since Cata and are down to 5 million players. I have no doubt that when next expansion goes live they will shoot back up several million like they always do. That's the way it works in every game.<br />
<br />
*incorrectly calls someone a fanboy and that they don't know what they are talking about; argues boxes sold are the same as active players*<br />
<br />
YOU call those people blizzfanboys because you have no real argument. Normal people call them...someone with a different perspective or opinion. He wasn't &quot;attacking&quot; the game, he was pointing out that Megaservers do in fact make the game world feel more populous, because that is part of their purpose in existing. <br />
<br />
You got a source on either of those things? Like....at all? You pinky promise you didn't make them up? Because googling it just linked me back to your post. The closest thing I could find was that 4.6M copies of GW2 were sold since it came out in 2012.<br />
<br />
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/2z31oh/guild_wars_2_has_sold_46_million_copies_since_its/<br />
<br />
This in no way indicates how many active accounts they have.<br />
<br />
If the company that made the game says 7 million accounts have been /created/, it's flat out not the case that every one of those are active. No ifs or buts. It means nothing, only active. If we want to play the &quot;accounts created&quot; game, WoW has 100m created accounts, but it means nothing because WoW currently has only 6m-ish active(someone may need to correct me on that, I got a feeling it may be 5M).<br />
<br />
But no, every fucking time a company posts &quot;X number of accounts CREATED&quot;, a massive amount of people crawl out of the woodwork and fall for it meaning active accounts.</div></div><hr />

If you enjoy the game, have fun, but trying to quantify their success seems pointless when pretty much every other wow-killer out there has done at least as good if not better than gw2.<br />
<br />
See this is why it's embarrassing to see such respond from a fellow WoW player's to another game's success. It was never a WoW-killer, the game itself never outright challenge the &quot;King of the Hill&quot; it knows that it isn't gonna topple the crown, it's just contend to have its spot on the hill.

Nonsense, it just means they aren't paying enough. Raise the salaries and there is suddenly no shortage of any job. If the salaries aren't commensurate to the work being asked of, then people will gravitate towards jobs that pay well for less effort.

100m wow accounts created. Nice try though.<br />
<br />
I'm curious -- of those WoW accounts. How many of those can currently play without paying the monthly fee... err I mean subscription?<br />
<br />
GW2, in my opinion, did a considerable amount of things *better* than WoW. While GW2 is more like a MMO-Diablo feel, here is what I think it destroys WoW in:<br />
<br />
<br />
Auction House (Selling and buying)<br />
Leveling<br />
Dynamic Events where things actually happen instead of a &quot;daily event&quot;.<br />
Transportations -- and they didn't even use flying, they found another way WoW dev's didn't think of!<br />
PvP -- Don't even get me started. If WoW did what GW2 it'd be FAR better than it is now.<br />
Shared banks across toons!<br />
<br />
<br />
That's just a quick list off the top of my head.<br />
<br />
So the fact that GW2 has 7 million *playable accounts* is kind of a huge deal and goes to speak about how WoW isn't doing so great. FF is also picking up LOTS of people as well.<br />
<br />
WoW may not be in its death throes but it's certainly not in a healthy state to puff up its chest.<br />
<br />
I bought it a while back and can still play it. Guess what you can't do without a WoW subscription? Play current content.</div></div><hr />

LOL I guess you dont know what you're talking about. The 5.6 m accounts are in fact the active accounts in Wow. This is the important number to track for a mmo! If you really want to compare with the same numbers: GW2 have 7 m created accounts and Wow have over 100 m created accounts.<br />
<br />
But grats to GW2 for reaching that number!</div></div><hr />

No, it's not that easy. SoO speaks to that. SoO lasted several months too long. If that do that again in WoD then it's going to be a very painful recovery.<br />
<br />
As for the planned obsolescence I think the problem is you have too many raiders who put their ego in their game. I'd rather *tiny* iLvL bumps. Meaning someone who did Mythic HM can walk into Mythic HFC. Sure it'd be a little more difficult on them than the others but they at least can hold their own weight.<br />
<br />
Alas, in this last tier expansion, you aren't likely to get a newbie to get their ring within any *near* future and getting someone from LFR-gear -&gt; Normal isn't something &quot;group finder&quot; usually takes... so you're left to being carried by someone due to this massive iLvl gap that's been created.</div></div><hr />

That's exactly the problem. Gear catch-up does not hurt raiding. Massive inflation of item level does. You just cannot jump from one difficulty to another that easily. I would also prefer small item level increases, because that's where skill shines. Also, balancing smaller power increases is much easier.</div></div><hr />

You must have been on a VERY low pop server (which isn't likely considering you are connected to at least one high pop server via connected realms NOT CRZ, those are two different things)or you're blatantly lying (i'm going to go with this one). Tanaan was OVER populated and the bugs revealed in the first week proved that (regarding rare announces) ... For the first month, it was quite irritating someone saying a rare was up and when I got there, it wasn't up because they were in a different instance of that zone. Whenever there is a set amount of people in the same zone (around 200) another &quot;copy&quot; of the zone is made and you are phased into that one. This was consistent for at least four weeks and finally got better. Tanaan is much less populated now, obviously, but saying it was dead on day one was a lie unless you joined a brand new server with no one on it.</div></div><hr />

This isn't the first time demands for a particular specialty exceeded the number of qualified candidates.

Tanaan certainly felt empty to me, even when it was new (my mains are on Medivh-US). Every time I grouped up and changed realms there were noticeable differences in population. I almost never had problems fighting for mobs or finishing the monotonous, monotonous quests, even on Day 1. I feel like I hardly ever even saw anybody (whoa there's someone else in this cave!)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh yeah, that 100m accounts. BTW do you realize that number includes trial accounts?<br />
<br />
As for me I had 3 paid accounts and over dozen trial accounts all of which I eventually abandoned.<br />
<br />
So what does that 100m really say?</div></div><hr />

100m says about 14.3 times more than 7m does. That's what.</div></div><hr />

That still means nothing. You have a 10+ year old gave vs a 3 year old game. The latter which has only introduced a free version in the last 2 months and almost never had trials before that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think fundamentally the real (and largely unsolvable) problem is that online games have to keep you on the hook. I mean I am all for getting your money's worth out of a game and I frequently blast Blizz for not delivering enough things to keep me logging in everyday.. But the chief design of basically every online game is 'keep them playing (and ideally paying) forever.' It's an unrealistic goal, the human condition is what it is. You could have a game with unlimited content and be completely free and still people would inevitably get bored and leave.<br />
<br />
I think it's a really good question - but I don't understand the disconnect with what they did in the past - which worked fairly well - and now, where they seem to have thrown it all out the window. It feels at times they have an unspoken or only-posted-inside-Blizzard rule that each expansion has to be different in all ways from the past, so they can't use the same techniques and structure that led them to success previously. The game should reflect the lessons learned in TBC, Wrath, Cata, Mop, and have structured goals that take a certain amount of time, still entertain, and not bunch everything up in the first 6 months of the game. <br />
<br />
I know he's talking theoretically, but if applied to Blizzard, it says to me they're incapable of learning either by rule or general consensus among the devs - &quot;We can't make unending content, so why bother at all?&quot; (Or worse, &quot;We know better than those who designed before us&quot;)<br />
<br />
They got ten years, and millions of players to pay, in record breaking numbers - and they can't figure out why? I think that's why WoD is such a disconnect - it doesn't feel like it was designed by devs who have 10 years of collective knowledge in entertaining people under their belts. In other industries, a decade is twice as long as most careers for bands, actors, and writers. What will it take for Blizzard to study what they've done, and bring back the parts that work? Or are they even allowed to. At best, WoD is a reboot of the game in a flawed vision that disregards the past, for an uncertain and unfocused (and unfun) future, topped with a little &quot;doing the best we can with a limited budget and limited time frame&quot; chasing the idiotic &quot;One expansion a year&quot; goal.<br />
<br />
This is why when they talk development, it's frustration for me - it doesn't add up. He says it's an &quot;unsolvable&quot; issue - but they did a pretty damned good job of it in TBC, Wrath, Cata, and MoP. Why doesn't the game reflect that? Why is a game they seemingly made effortlessly and with great joy, now nothing but compromises, dilution, failed expectations and goals (I'm looking at you, Holinka - yes, we know you read here), and a disjointed vision and philosophy from the designers? I doubt that it's this &quot;unsolvable riddle&quot; of endless content. I feel when GC is talking about things like this, he's holding back a MOUNTAIN of things to say about the company he left. <br />
<br />
Just my opinion. And, it's why his comments can be interesting - the more he says, the less sense the current devs make.</div></div><hr />

Facebook browser games have more playable accounts than GW2 and I don't know one person who plays it.<br />

Funny.. that's exactly what people do in WoW while waiting for a queue to pop. So much so we need an addon to let us know something is ready.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fishoa</div><div class="date">2015-10-27, 04:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm curious -- of those WoW accounts. How many of those can currently play without paying the monthly fee... err I mean subscription?<br />
<br />
GW2, in my opinion, did a considerable amount of things *better* than WoW. While GW2 is more like a MMO-Diablo feel, here is what I think it destroys WoW in:<br />
<br />
<br />
Auction House (Selling and buying)<br />
Leveling<br />
Dynamic Events where things actually happen instead of a &quot;daily event&quot;.<br />
Transportations -- and they didn't even use flying, they found another way WoW dev's didn't think of!<br />
PvP -- Don't even get me started. If WoW did what GW2 it'd be FAR better than it is now.<br />
Shared banks across toons!<br />
<br />
<br />
That's just a quick list off the top of my head.<br />
<br />
So the fact that GW2 has 7 million *playable accounts* is kind of a huge deal and goes to speak about how WoW isn't doing so great. FF is also picking up LOTS of people as well.<br />
<br />
WoW may not be in its death throes but it's certainly not in a healthy state to puff up its chest.<br />
<br />
I bought it a while back and can still play it. Guess what you can't do without a WoW subscription? Play current content.<br />
<br />
You should stop drinking the kool-aid a bit. I'll give you that the Auction House in GW2 is a lot better than WoW's (which is archaic and needs the use of an addon for most things) and that the shared banks across toons is pretty neat (however, sharing the same limited space is not). <br />
<br />
But saying leveling in GW2 is better is so much bullshit. It's super grindy. Sure you don't pick up quests anymore, you just do hearts, which is exactly the same: kill bears, pick up stuff on the floor, etc. Leveling an alt in GW2 is even worse. Because you usually did the other low level areas to get an xp boost, you were super burnt out during a second run through. Class Quests (or Personal Story Quests) are so far away one from another that when you got to the other quests you barely remembered the story.<br />
<br />
Also, LOL at the PvP. Sure you don't mean the sPvP, that is completely dead since 3 months after release. Did you mean WvW, which is basically the same since that Karma Train mode everybody goes to level? A mode that is abandoned and devs made no major announcements to fix all the chronic problems? WvW is DEAD outside top tier servers and that it will never change because Anet refuses to merge servers.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying WoW is perfect, but WoD got leveling right. PvP is a wreck train on both games.</div></div><hr />

GW2 have this good aspect: the out in the world experience, but it's instanced gameplay is bad...

Not that it is, but close enough for that to be an issue.<br />
<br />
¹: I was wrong, like Eiserne Drossel said, all characters PvP as equals... From the wiki &quot;All players are scaled to level 80 and have a separate set of traits, items, and skills. All skills and traits that scale to level will scale to level 80. As a result, a level 1 player will be on the same playing field as a level 80 character.&quot;<br />

Please stop spreading so much bullshit.<br />
<br />
PvP don't upscale anyone to any level, you are ALL on the same level with the same tools. Everyone can configure what builds they want to use and they all fight against each other in the most fair sense there is. PvE levels don't matter when you enter the PvP area.<br />
<br />
Exotics are not even close to rare items in World of Warcraft. If anything, ascended quality is item level 500 and exotic quality is item level 495. The stat difference is minor, and ascended quality is for people who just crave that gear grind with not much difference at all.<br />
<br />
The economy is just as it should be, and it's very player driven. Easy obtainable items are cheap, and harder obtainable items are slightly more expensive. Gaining gold is not even hard, it just requires you to DO things. Instead of having gold sellers invading the game, ArenaNet decided to sell their own gems if people want, or you can just convert the gold you have in to gems if you want anything from the store.<br />
<br />
The game is not even close to be P2W. Even World of Warcraft would be considered closer to P2W then in your standards.<br />
<br />
The holy trinity with dungeons are indeed a mess in my opinion, and I agree on that. ArenaNet have talked about changing that with the newly launched 10 raids, that you will need melee DPS, debuff DPS, support and control, and it's true what they have shown so far.</div></div><hr />

I've played both and this comment offends me. GW2 gameplay with its VERY LIMITED abilities, and grand PVP battles is the reason I stopped playing. It's nothing but a train of 30 people running in a circle capping things. You can't go off on your own because if you get caught in the train you lose. I dare you to play GW2 as much as you've played WoW and see how much you like it.<br />
<br />
Like anything, WoW is just an old game. Old but still great at what it does. You play something long enough, you get tired of it. But the ability that WoW has to bring back people at each expansion is what remains remarkable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are right... I was under the impression that the scaling was not perfect because me and a guildie were demolishing some guys, and it was my 3rd PvP match ever, and he said &quot;we were the only 80s&quot;... I misinterpreted him thinking that he meant that we were stronger, when he probably meant we were more experienced (as players, not characters)... I edited the comment to show tha the information I posted was wrong, in case someone reads my comment and skips yours for some weird reason :P<br />
<br />
--- Edit: ok, edited the rest of my comment (this one, the previous one is still complete, only with the correction you made) because even though I do believe GW2 have lots of problems, it is still a great game, and maybe the way I critized it make it sound worst than it actually is... It would be fair to say that anyone who buys GW2 will get his/hers money worth... It's a good game, even with all problems some people (like me) think it have...</div></div><hr />

Like any other games. Meanwhile, even if I takes some breaks, I'm still coming back to Wow even after 10 years. Even if the game is not as good as before, there's a little something that I never find in any onther games that makes me play and come back every time... since 10 years now!</div></div><hr />
