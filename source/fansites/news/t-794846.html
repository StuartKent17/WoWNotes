What's in Patch 4.0.3a<br />
Sammew posted an interesting list of the features you should and should not expect in Patch 4.0.3a on the official forums (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/134406/403a-what-is-in-it-what-is-not). Zarhym also jumped in, and announced a 20% reduction to the XP required to gain levels from 71 to 80. <br />

<br />
Beta Build 13066 - Portals removed from Shattrath and Dalaran<br />
Blizzard doesn't want you to use Shattrath and Dalaran as portal hubs anymore, the latest beta update removed all the portal to the cities and replaced them with class trainers. <br />

<br />
Cataclysm / Patch 4.0.3a - The Shattering<br />
I went through all the old zones pages and updated all of them with screenshots from the latest build of the beta (if you're wondering, that's a little more than 1400 screenshots). All these zones will be changed when Patch 4.0.3a is deployed on live servers this week. I also included links to Wowpedia (http://www.wowpedia.org/) for people who are looking for a few extra lore informations, etc ...<br />
<br />
With the expansion getting closer, expect a lot of similar updates to Cataclysm articles in the next few days. <br />

Mounts and Items Removed in 4.0.3<br />
As stated in the Under Dev page (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/), patch 4.0.3 brings about The Shattering, a cataclysmic event that will forever change the face of Azeroth. As we prepare to raise the level cap and introduce two new races with the Cataclysm expansion, it's important to keep in mind that the game world is going through tremendous changes that will affect the availability of certain rare mounts and items.<br />
<br />
Swift Zulian Tiger<br />
Zul'Gurub is changing from a raid to a leveling zone in 4.0.3, and this mount will no longer be obtainable.<br />
<br />
Swift Razzashi Raptor<br />
This mount will also no longer be obtainable after the change to Zul'Gurub.<br />
<br />
Razzashi Hatchling<br />
With the change to Zul'Gurub this non-combat pet will no longer be obtainable. (Update - The Razzashi Hatchling is [b]still obtainable in Patch 4.0.3a (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/129029/is-the-razzashi-hatchling-item-to-be-removed))<br />
<br />
Tome of Polymorph: Turtle http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage<br />
This tome will continue to be available through other means.<br />
<br />
Crusader's White/Black Warhorse and Swift Alliance Steed/Swift Horde Wolf<br />
As the attempt-based tribute system is being removed from Heroic Trial of the Crusader, the Argent Crusade Tribute Chest will no longer spawn, and these mounts will no longer be obtainable<br />
<br />
Reins of the Blue Drake<br />
This mount will once again be available from defeating 10-player Malygos without needing to use the Dungeon Finder. The Reins of the Azure Drake will only be available on 25-player Malygos.<br />
<br />
Mimiron's Head<br />
This mount will change to be a very low drop chance when defeating 25-player Yogg'Saron with no Keepers assisting you<br />
<br />
Invincible<br />
This mount will change to be a very low drop chance when defeating Heroic 25-player Lich King<br />
<br />
Although we have no current plans to introduce new ways to obtain the Zul'Gurub mounts, pets, and the tribute mounts, they may return should we find a place where they fit in the future. <br />

The Shattering of Azeroth<br />
In the frigid wastes of Northrend, the final battle against the merciless Lich King ended in victory for Azeroth's defenders. Upon returning home, veterans of the unforgiving conflict against the Scourge were showered with praise for their valiant sacrifices, while the honorable dead were mourned. Yet as hope flared anew in the wake of the Lich King's fall, Azeroth's native elemental spirits grew confused and erratic, setting off a series of deadly natural disasters. Horde and Alliance leaders scrambled for clues about the troubling state of the world, but nothing could have prepared them for what was to come.<br />
<br />
Without warning, the corrupted Dragon Aspect, Deathwing, erupted from the stone heart of Deepholm, the domain of earth within the Elemental Plane. Jagged fissures were torn across the earth, and monstrous waves pummeled coastal regions. From Thousand Needles to the Blasted Lands, the surface of Azeroth was reforged through violent upheavals. Now, the Horde and the Alliance must defend their homes against Deathwing and his minions, burdened by the unsettling fact that the world as they know it has changed... forever.<br />
<br />
Azeroth Shattered<br />
<br />
Deathwing's return has had an immeasurable impact throughout the Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor. Players will notice drastically altered terrain, thousands of new quests from levels 1-55, and updated level ranges for some zones to improve the questing flow.<br />
<br />
<br />
New Race/Class Combinations<br />
<br />
In the wake of a world on the brink of destruction, members of the Horde and Alliance have taken to new cultures and studies, mastering crafts previously foreign to them. Many existing playable races now have new class combinations. Check the official World of Warcraft: Cataclysm website for a breakdown of the new combinations.<br />
<br />
<br />
General<br />
<br />
The World of Warcraft: Cataclysm cinematic trailer and login screen have been added to the game.<br />
Experience required to gain levels 71 through 80 has been reduced by 20%, which increases leveling rate by 25%.<br />
<br />
<br />
Classes: General<br />
<br />
Due to several talent revisions for select classes, druids, paladins, priests, and shaman have had their talent trees reset.<br />
The damage and healing done by players from levels 1-79 has been retuned, with the base points of almost all spells and abilities reduced. This was done to bring combat times at low levels to a more reasonable length. For most abilities that deal weapon damage, the weapon damage percent now rises per level until level 80, and starts at a lower percent.<br />
Healing Rain, Efflorescence, Holy Radiance, Holy Word: Sanctuary now have a diminished effect when healing more than 6 players at once.<br />
Mortal Strike, Furious Attacks, Wound Poison, Widow Venom, Permafrost, Improved Mind Blast, Monstrous Bite, and Legion Strike now reduce healing by 10%, down from 25%.<br />
Effects which are broken from taking too much damage (Fear, Frost Nova, Entangling Roots, etc.) now break automatically from about half as much damage taken as before.<br />

Symbiosis: heal-over-time spells (Rejuvenation, Regrowth, Lifebloom) can no longer benefit from this Mastery merely by refreshing themselves. A different heal-over-time spell must be present.<br />
<br />
<br />
Glyphs<br />
<br />
Glyph of Healing Touch now reduces the cooldown on Nature's Swiftness by 10 seconds after using Healing Touch, up from 5 seconds.<br />

<br />
Agreed. You perhaps don't realise just how much until you play the new areas and then it hits you that for the past 6 years you've been looking at the same stuff in some areas and it's never changed. The changes they've made brings the original game right up to date and there are so many awesome changes. I can't wait to get into some serious alt action and re-live the 1-60 journey again through different quests and zones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People planning to re-roll new class/race combos + the level 80 players who want to do all the new quests/low level achievements get to basically do them 2 weeks before cata launches. Then the new re-rollers to worgen/goblins get to start, so less burden on the mid-level zones due to the new race/class combos getting the 2 week head start. And with different paths for lvl 80-85 progression, that also spreads out the playerbase again. All that taken into account + the technical issues of the actual shattering being implemented 2 weeks earlier, giving blizzard time to fix any major bugs that might come with it before the actual launch of cata, should mean this will be one smooth launch. At least I hope so!</div></div><hr />

&quot;What's in Patch 4.0.3a<br />
<br />
[..]<br />
What is in:<br />
<br />
* Portals in Dalaran/Shattrath Removed<br />
* Class trainers in Dalaran where portals once were<br />
* New race-class combinations (excluding worgen/goblin)<br />
[...]&quot;<br />
<br />
Any comments on Mage's Fire Specialization?<br />

new race class is available for 4.0.3a but if u wanna do Paid Race Change, u'll have to wait for cata.</div></div><hr />

That was for Goblin and Worgen.<br />
<br />
The new combination Race Change hasnt been confirmed, but i would assume they will allow it for 4.0.3a as they are allowing Worgen and Goblins to Race Change on day 1 of Cataclysm.<br />

<br />
Blizz patch notes are notoriously, consistently incomplete, and generally only include the changes the devs appear to believe are &quot;major&quot; enough to mention. But HotT is being changed to a FoS (&quot;Defeat Algalon the Observer in 10-player mode at level 80 without anyone in the raid wearing any equipment with an item level higher than is available in 10-player Ulduar.&quot;, emphasis is mine to highlight the change) so it should still be obtainable provided that everyone in the raid meets the requirements</div></div><hr />

Changing to the new race/class combos will also be available once Cataclysm is released on December 7th. There will be a period of time between the Shattering and the launch of Cataclysm where the new combos can be created but not changed into. As with everything, this could change.<br />

Really? I mean, really? Seriously, you and the Warlock guy, if a class is out of balanced it needs to be buffed/nerfed. It's what they do. It's been years, literally years, since an entire class has been significantly out of balance for any length of time (individual specs occasionally, but not entire classes). In the unlikely event that these change weren't needed to fix an existing imbalance and if they actually did take the class out of balance, they'll be fixed. Really. It's not the end of the world. Blizzard does not hate your class. Just give it a bit for people to actually play the game on live, at max level, if it's a problem it'll be fixed.</div></div><hr />

No.. the new zones are there, but you just can't enter them, or at least on the ptr when I tried to enter MH via Winterspring I got teleported back to Winterspring as soon as I got inside MH zone.</div></div><hr />

Game-wise, they don't want you to be hearthed in old content. They want you to be in your faction capitol cities.<br />
<br />
Lore-wise, they are saying that the Horde and Alliance hate each other again and the feel-good buddy-cop collaborations of Outlands and Northrend is no more. We can't hang out together.</div></div><hr />

I am an arcane mage and I agree that for the amount of buttons I press (one most of the time) I do a stupid amount of damage.

I like both classes but honestly I guess it doesn't affect me as much as it would those who play warlocks as their main. <br />
<br />
As for he shattering itself happening tomorrow, I can see it happening. Though the one thing I'm wondering at the moment is if we will still be able to get the rifts Feat of Strength after the shattering or if that will be gone when the lands change. If they will be gone, I will need to get that done on my last 3 toons. <br />

I mean wtf? Lock rotations are currently twice as complex as the faceroll mages ones and we get nerfed? F serious?<br />
<br />
Yeah I know what you mean. Lock rotations include somewhere around 8 or so spells (i.e., curse of elements, corruption, bane of doom, soulfire, etc.etc.). When I play my mage, I can use just arcane blast after cd's popped and crit upward of 75k-80k per hit (in icc on lk phase 1). Though of course using arcane missiles whenever they proc will benefit you dps as a mage because using it will give you like 5 seconds or so of a nice haste boost (I forget what it is, but maybe around 8%?). Anyway, I guess this patch is what will be there for when everyone installs cat and begins playing the expansion.<br />
<br />
Also a note: I remember being in a raid the other day as my lock and there was 4 other geared locks in the raid. On the dps meters, 4 of the locks were in the top 5 for dps ( and I mean doing 12k-15k single target; each lock varied in spec). I'm not sure but this may be why Blizz did this nerf. But, yea I do still do insane amounts of burst damage on my mage so idk why they buffed mages when they are already strong in damage, etc.</div></div><hr />

Been farming ZG solo since i was in all Kara epics; saw the raptor twice and no tiger, sadly. The tiger was the mount I've really wanted this whole time.:-(<br />
<br />
Are people really complaining about Warlock dps nerfs? Our warlocks were doing 19-20k on almost every fight in heroic ICC25 and well ahead of everybody. Our warriors were next behind them on the charts and probably needed a nerf, but not as large as what was received (except AoE: they were doing 22-25k thanks to the spammable nature of Cleave). <br />
<br />
It sucks to be nerfed (my feral's health was just cut down a sizable amount, too), but be honest: feral health, lock dps, and warrior dps were too high and needed to come down.</div></div><hr />

Are people really complaining about Warlock dps nerfs? Our warlocks were doing 19-20k on almost every fight in heroic ICC25 and well ahead of everybody. Our warriors were next behind them on the charts and probably needed a nerf, but not as large as what was received (except AoE: they were doing 22-25k thanks to the spammable nature of Cleave). <br />
<br />
It sucks to be nerfed (my feral's health was just cut down a sizable amount, too), but be honest: feral health, lock dps, and warrior dps were too high and needed to come down.<br />
<br />
Warlocks are pure dps...dont forget that. cannot do anything else.<br />
Plus they have complex rotations &amp; they scale too bad with gear...(probably the worst class)<br />
But what really pisses me off is the kind of nerf they did..... instead of adjusting some skills they just reduced all by 12%?? <br />
that is so lame and so lazy!!<br />
i cannot believe they are actually bringing that into live servers ¬¬<br />
<br />
Im trully not excited at all with this new expansion... so many things im not liking....</div></div><hr />

<br />
No I don't rage over every little thing actually and I'm sure that things get to you once in awhile too.<br />
<br />
There was no real rational behind removing these things. There were plenty of other areas they could've put a leveling area without removing ZG. SV is HUGE. Why screw over those who haven't had the luck of others and have been farming this for over a year even? Absolutely pointless.<br />
<br />
For a similar reason, some of us are still farming the white polar bear and the green proto-drake mounts. I've actually moved my mage to a separate account so she can port my main (a priest) to Dalaran. It's only a matter of time before Blizz realizes their mistake and at LEAST puts a port to Dalaran or somewhere in Northrend.</div></div><hr />

Like the Kirin Tor Ring? Or the Argent Tournament Tabard? I even hear there is an item that works the same but for Outland, too! Although if needing to take a few minutes to hop on a boat or a zeppelin from a city you were probably already in anyway is too much of an inconvenience for you, then you are probably too lazy to get those items too.</div></div><hr />

These wouldn't be very valid for newer players who didn't spend months in Northrend so like I said, you will see a port when they realize their mistake. They already added one to Blasted Lands for Outland content.</div></div><hr />

time for another MMo ¬¬<br />
<br />
This numbers for Warrior and lock are for lowlvl skills and he missed other classes nerfs like rogue. lvl 80+ skills have their own numbers.<br />
They said in a blue this change is to keep 1-80 pvp and pve fights more fun and prevent two shots(ambush oneshot) on player/mobs. <br />
For example:<br />
<br />
Backstab is also 200% at level 80. If you are on beta, you may have a tooltip that says 150%, but it is lying to you. If you are on live, it has always been 200% and will stay that way for Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Below level 80, Backstab (and other attacks) will do less weapon damage, which is really all this change was trying to accomplish.<br />
<br />
This will apply to many classes.<br />
So Lock dps don't change on lvl80+ and will be the same in end content of cataclym that you have on beta. And yes, they are they're the casters with best numbers in general.<br />
<br />
Edit: This changes are the same we have on beta and you don't see locks crying there about dps. Go and see the QQ guys are PVE Mages xD</div></div><hr />

They already added one to Blasted Lands for Outland content.<br />
Well there isn't really a &quot;fast&quot; way to get to the Blasted Lands for the Horde from a capital city if you don't have a mage. So it made sense to add that portal. There really isn't much of a reason to add something to Northrend when the boats and zeppelins travel to the start areas already and are outside/inside major starting zones.<br />
<br />
As someone who leveled a character from 1-85 on the beta recently I only saw one problem with the portal removal. And that was when I completed Outland, as a Horde character I had to go through the Dark Portal and fly all the way to Undercity to get to Northrend. For the Alliance it isn't a huge deal with SW so close. But then again, we are talking about a 1 time annoyance per characters. I think if I level another character in that level range again I'll likely just keep my Hearthstone set to a major city and not bother with setting it anywhere in Outland.<br />
<br />
It will be a little awkward these next two weeks with people that are still raiding. But once the expansion comes out, SW/Org will be just like Dalaran/Shattrath were in that they are your launch point to the new zones which in turn means you have decent launch points to most places on the continents already.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My gf who loves WoW and has played a lock since vanilla has been flat out refusing to switch over to the The Old Republic when it launches. So this morning she's reading mmo-champion and says to me something like &quot;so I will give The Old Republic a try&quot;. I'm like great, I can't wait. Now I know why lol. I tried telling her they were changing things up a bunch. <br />
<br />
Now that bioware has confirmed it will be out in the next few months I'm happy as hell. Though I wish I hadn't wasted my money preordering her cataclysm now. It's cool, she's really into it, and we can play while we wait. Small amount of money to pay to get her to switch to something more fun. Kind of sad I spend more time on the forums by far than I do in the game. <br />
<br />
On a note to the patch, why nerf engineering so bad? I mean come on, the announcement that it wouldn't even be usable in rated bgs, we can't use it in arenas, the removal of any bonus stats. That means what for the class? <br />
<br />
I can make a head attachment that gives me a slight chance to mc something, with the downside that if it misfires I'm in trouble. A slowfall cloak enchant, slight bonus to armor on gloves, and a speed increase on boots.<br />
<br />
Compared to 40 stat to strength or stam for my paladin? Compared to a haste increase, intellect increase for my mage? How is that even a choice.</div></div><hr />

You are absolutely right, fortunately for me after introducing my friends to The Old Republic they decided to convert. The best thing that wow has going for it is that sense of community. The only reason I stayed around for cata was the gf. Now that blizz convinced her to give it a shot. <br />
<br />
This brings up an interesting question for those that are going to switch. If you do intend to stay in touch, how? For me I'm keeping the same vent for ToR that we have for wow. There will just be a different wow room for them to use. They are welcome to come into the main room and talk though. So anyone else?</div></div><hr />

OMG THE SKY IS FALLING IM GETTING NERFED QQ<br />

<br />
I look forward to enjoy my world of warcraft without you! glhf dont let the door hit you on the way out.<br />
<br />
Been playing WoW for over 4 years and i dont consider myself a bad player.<br />
You seem a lot more of a bad player than i do just by your insulting words ¬¬ u just look like a fanboy.<br />
No the sky is not falling ´cause of a Nerf...true...but i only play Warlock...and let me tell you,we are the most nerfed class by far...always....<br />
At the moment classes seem so unbalanced to me,some classes can do all (tank,heal &amp; dps) so pure classes should have a obvious plus in their only specialty.<br />
<br />
Plus nerfing a class by reducing all skills dmg by 12% seems to be a very easy way to nerf...lazy as hell.<br />
Learn to accept peoples thoughts without insulting..... i look forward to enjoy my game without ppl like you too...so both happy ;)</div></div><hr />

It says that Orcs can be priests.<br />

Actually, it doesn't. The image is grayed out, just not toned down to almost black like the rest of the unavailable combos. There is a pretty major error in it though. It shows Trolls as getting locks, and I'm fairly certain they aren't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just spring 2011 so far, which puts it between 2 to 4 months away. There was an accidental release date published that was removed quickly showing march 2011. Now how &quot;accidental&quot; that was is unknown. It might have been just a slip up of &quot;oh #$% I know you didn't just&quot; or the kind of slip that's for the fans that read the forums every day. Who knows which one. If that is accurate though it will put the game out in around 4 months. <br />
<br />
Personally based on the dev logs I don't see that happening. The game has been playable for over a year now, with closed beta going on since July, and playable versions in several shows. I would see it being in feb sometime. But that's just my opinion, and the only official thing so far is a spring '11 release, with the unconfirmed march release. The good thing though about it is that they didn't have to set a release date. They were given a green light, and several hundred million dollars to make the game. So if they say &quot;hey it will be out in spring '11&quot; I believe them. More importantly I believe that it won't release with nearly the amount of bugs that other games have. The balance is also an issue, because like WoW pvp was an after thought, where they are going into it balancing for pvp from the start too. <br />
<br />
I actually don't mind waiting, it seems like new things are getting revealed still. <br />
<br />
http://www.swtor.com/info/systems/crew-skills<br />
<br />
That's a cool way of dealing with crafting, and gathering. Letting your crew do it for you while you are out with your friends. Seems pretty damn sweet. <br />
<br />
Oh and to that guy that said The Old Republic was just like kotr, awesome I didn't see you in the beta. What's your name? OH, you mean you were going into a fanboy rage and just guessing it will be like that. Well you know what? I love knights of the old republic. I thought KotR was just an amazing game. So let's see, KotR that I can play with my friends. Yes, I will take that any day of the week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There was no real rational behind removing these things. There were plenty of other areas they could've put a leveling area without removing ZG. SV is HUGE. Why screw over those who haven't had the luck of others and have been farming this for over a year even? Absolutely pointless.<br />
<br />
For a similar reason, some of us are still farming the white polar bear and the green proto-drake mounts. I've actually moved my mage to a separate account so she can port my main (a priest) to Dalaran. It's only a matter of time before Blizz realizes their mistake and at LEAST puts a port to Dalaran or somewhere in Northrend.<br />
I bet if you had the mount you'd be perfectly indifferent about changing it to a leveling zone.</div></div><hr />

Class trainers and an AH WILL be put up in Dalaran, since the portals was mainly there cos the lack of those. I for one am truelly happy to get out of Lagaran. Always hated this place incl. Shat.</div></div><hr />

No, we have some cloak, glove and belt &quot;enchants&quot; exclusive to engineers, such as parachute cloaks, rocket boots, and mind control caps. Most of them used to have stats with them, but the stats are disappearing with this patch. Now we'll be able to enchant them and still put our awesome abilities to them.</div></div><hr />

Oh sweet! Thanks for the clarification... though that kinda means we have to spend a bit more for enchanting stuff. :/<br />
Still unsure of the Warrior changes though, I'm pretty sure HS, Cleave and Execute were supposed to be BUFFED, and MS, BT and RB are NERFED.<br />
I'm sure the Fury nerfs are justified though @ 85, as Deep Wounds will be reachable soon(tm), and RB will start hitting like a truck with the Unshackle Fury buff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well considering that's almost a year of beta, and it was playable for a year before that for their first closed beta. I would think most of the bugs are gone already. They put up some great videos showing the play. I think the hardest part for them so far was the inclusion of the physix. Which is fine, I'm cool with them spending the extra time for that. It's worth it, and it looks damn nice. Then there is the voice over work. They have 12 full time writers that have been working on it for at least a year and a half. All of that has to be voiced over before release. So yeah, I can deal with the wait. It looks like to me that the leaked march release will be it. So second half of march puts it at roughly 4 months from release.</div></div><hr />

No they aren't coming back and they don't need to. You're looking at Cata through Vanilla, BC and LK eyes. First off - quests aren't going to take you all over the world anymore. The zones are completely re-done and are very, very linear. Secondly - you should never be that far from any major city to which you can train - Org for example has a class trainer for every class except DKs. And last but not least - when you hit Outland and Northrend you will have NO need of the portals as there will be an auction house AND class trainers in both Shatt and Dal.<br />
<br />
Pre-Cata=bouncing from EK to Kalimdor over and over. 4.0.3a and beyond removes that annoying feature of WoW.</div></div><hr />

As of the current build on the PTR 4.0.3a you can be a troll Warlock. Of all the icons to make the grayscale but not faded mistake the priest is the worst, with so little color on it to begin with.

Yes Unholy is more polished, but I quite like how 2h Frost plays right now. And it is in no way near as unpolished and tattered as Blood...<br />
<br />
Blood is quite literally, no pun intended, an abomination. Stuck in limbo between DPSing with Heart Strike, and mitigating with Death Strike. Valuable FU runes get converted into invaluable B runes, which is a design flaw that should be changed. Yes changing Blood Rites to work like Blood of the North would make it homogenized, but it is a million times better than the current state of things.<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler has said that they are probably going to get rid of Pestilence for Blood DKs, and just focus on Blood Boil as their &quot;AOE&quot; (Frost uses Howling Blast, Unholy uses Pestilence.) Which I think is a step in the right direction. I just hope they can fix Blood DKs in time for raiding, even Heroics in Cataclysm. Because in their current state, Blood tanking is all over the place.</div></div><hr />

Don't get me wrong, I heal in 90% of the bg's but still, it's too fucking easy and what made it slightly hard was having a debuff that gimped my healing now it's just too easy, healing tons and never dying yea, gonna be fun healing cata now.</div></div><hr />
