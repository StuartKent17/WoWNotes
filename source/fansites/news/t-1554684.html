<br />
Warlords of Draenor Beta Patch Notes - July 17 Update<br />
Racial Traits<br />
<br />
Human<br />
<br />
The Human Spirit has been redesigned. It now increases Versatility (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/114013), scaling with character level. no longer increases Spirit by 3%, and instead now increases 2 secondary stats by an amount scaling with character level. You can choose which 2 secondary stats it increases. This has not yet been implemented.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Self-Sustainability<br />
<br />
Hunter<br />
<br />
Survivalist is a new passive ability learned by Survival Hunters at level 10.<br />
<br />
Survivalist increases the Hunter's chance to Multistrike by 10%. Additionally, the Hunter gains 15% health over 10 seconds after killing a target.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Class Changes<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight<br />
<br />
Blood Changes<br />
Active Mitigation was a very successful design that was inspired by Death Knights' tanking style. However, it went beyond that, and Death Knights themselves were somewhat left behind in that regard. We made several changes to bring up the interactivity of Blood combat. This includes making Death Strike (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/49998) cause healing based on attack power, but be affected by the new Resolve passive (see Tank Vengeance (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/84839) and Resolve above), which gives it the traditional increase from recent damage. Plus, Rune Tap (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/48982) is being significantly improved, to become a strong Active Mitigation button. To tie those together, Blood's Mastery is being changed to affect both the size of the Blood Shield absorb, and the new Rune Shield absorb.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rune Tap (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/48982) has been redesigned. It now reduces all damage taken by 50% for 3 seconds. now grants an absorption shield equal to 30% of your missing health. It also now has 2 charges, with a 40-second recharge time.<br />
<br />
Will of the Necropolis (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/81164) has been redesigned. It now automatically triggers an immediate, free Rune Tap (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/48982) when you take damage that reduces you below 30% health. This effect cannot occur more often than once every 45 seconds. now grants an immediate charge, and makes your next Rune Tap (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/48982) free. However, its damage reduction buff now only lasts 4 seconds (down from 8 seconds).<br />
<br />
<br />
Miscellaneous<br />
Conversion (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/119975) was changed to cost different amounts by specialization, instead of reducing Runic Power generation differently by specialization. This way, Runic Power beyond what you spend on Conversion (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/119975) is not penalized.<br />
<br />
Conversion (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/119975) no longer has an initial tick, and now costs 15 Runic Power/second for Blood, 20 Runic Power/sec for Frost, and 10 Runic Power/second for Unholy.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter<br />
<br />
Ability Consolidation and Refinement<br />
<br />
Chimera Shot (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/53209) no longer heals the Hunter.<br />
<br />
<br />
Marksmanship Changes<br />
One of our new secondary stats Multistrike, is strikingly similar to the Wild Quiver Mastery for Marksmanship Hunters. To address this similarity, we replaced Wild Quiver with a new Mastery: Sniper Training. Marksmanship Hunters that favored Mastery before will want to favor Multistrike for a similar feel. For their new Mastery, we wanted to add some depth to their moment-to-moment gameplay, and compliment Critical Strike. In order to do that, we brought back the concept of Sniper Training.<br />
<br />
We also changed the design of Chimera Shot (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/53209) (and fixed its name), in order to better capture the intended flavor. Finally, we added an interaction between Careful Aim (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/34483) and Rapid Fire (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/3045) (and indirectly Aimed Shot (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/19434) through a Draenor Perk), so as to add a bit more depth to their gameplay.<br />
<br />
Chimera Shot (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/53209) has been renamed Chimaera Shot. It is now a two-headed shot that hits two targets, and deals Frost or Nature damage. It no longer heals the Hunter.<br />
<br />
<br />
Survival Changes<br />
Apart from rotational changes through Ability Pruning, changes for Survival Hunters mostly center on Lock and Load (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/56343). We changed how Lock and Load (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/56343) is triggered to increase the value of Multistrike, provide gameplay depth and the ability to pool damage more. Also note the new passive ability, Survivalist, which increases multistrike chance by 10%, in order to give Survival Hunters some baseline Multistrike chance.<br />
<br />
Survivalist is a new passive ability learned by Survival Hunters at level 10.<br />
<br />
Survivalist increases the chance to Multistrike by 10% and the Hunter gains 15% health over 10 seconds after killing a target.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage<br />
<br />
Ability Consolidation and Refinement<br />
<br />
Ignite now deals the same total damage with a 1 second period (down from 2 seconds). Base duration changed to 5 seconds so that duration when refreshed remains 6 seconds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A lot of classes got sustainability things like that; for BM and survival, they get 15% instantly when they kill a target with Kill Shot, IIRC. For survival, it's after just killing the target, since we don't have Kill Shot in WoD</div></div><hr />

It has been in there since like the first build of WoD alpha. The only change to that this patch is that they are adding multistrike to survivalist since SV is shit without MS.</div></div><hr />

Hunter is looking pretty grim from all these changes, it just doesnt look like it will be able to do enough burst damage when everyone is moving around so much... so right now when I pop all my cooldowns and burst someone, they need to stun me to mitigate my damage, but this change to MM hunter makes them the ones being kited instead of being the Kiter.<br />
<br />
Two things wrong with the changes.<br />
<br />
1. Heal from chim gone, this is pretty big ratio that we needed for our self heals. I am already using the glyph for extra healing, and they are making it so its now mandatory glyph.... ? I would have been happier if they just put the 2% baseline and remove the stupid glyph.<br />
<br />
2. Hunter being a more stationary class seems like a fun idea in design, but when you apply it to the settings of a raid or PVE now you just have another class that gets a dps hit for having to move a lot. This same thing applies for PVP, being crippled by movement is no fun, especially when you have monks flying all over the place kiting for days.</div></div><hr />

Having to use AOE in a single target rotation also feels really broken. If a group of adds are CC and you run in, your only moves will be DS / DC as you cant Pest because the AOE will bust the CC.. <br />
<br />
You really do want to fall asleep playing this spec. Not only the slowness but i still think we will be least desired for progression tanking compared to the pala/warrior tanks we suck. I think there is such thing as to much active mitigation. I guess this is why the spec is so slow to play (they cant all that downtime to allow you to manage mitigation) but for me that does not seam so fun. Faster gameplay managing DS/Shield was ok but chucking runetap into it along with the slow combat wont be good for me anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Simple answer is yes, they do. What you explain as a problem routinely overlooked until later patches is probably either untuned yet like so many other beta features or an intentionally chosen upgrade path for Blood--stack haste to get a more seamless rotation... If desired. Some players may just not care about as much as you do.<br />

Doesnt mean much. The first couple xpac levels are intentionally easy and players usually outgear the xpac freens by a lot. If it feels the same at L98, then there is a problem</div></div><hr />
