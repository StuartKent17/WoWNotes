If you don't follow the news every day, it can be hard to find content after it falls off of the first page. A site specific search (https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ammo-champion.com%2Fcontent%2F mage tier 17) can help, but we are also adding a menu to the front page with links to all of the bigger recaps we do. This should make it easier to find content later on. <br />

Warlords of Draenor - Guild Leveling Removed<br />
What you're seeing in the current build is a change that's mid-implementation. Since the introduction of the guild system in Cataclysm, the nature of guild leveling and guild perks has shifted from being a reward for dedication and collective effort, to effectively being a penalty and barrier to entry for new guilds. We've made it easier to level guilds over the years, allowing low-level quests to count fully towards guild experience, and removing weekly caps on progress. That helps ease the barriers, but it's more of a band-aid than a true solution to the underlying problem.<br />
<br />
Our current plan for Warlords is to effectively remove guild leveling (you could also think of it as &quot;all guilds are automatically level 25&quot;). We originally came up with two dozen perks in order to offer something at every guild level, but without the continued need for that granularity, we can streamline the system a bit. Many perks can just be rolled into default behaviors, since a majority of players already had them and the world was designed and tuned around their existence: Flight path taxis can just inherently move 25% faster instead of requiring &quot;Ride Like the Wind&quot;; Honor rewards and item costs can be balanced as if you had &quot;Honorable Mention&quot;; and so forth. For most players, who are in max-level guilds, nothing should perceptibly change. <br />
<br />
We still want to incentivize guild membership, aside from the social benefits, so we're keeping conveniences like faster mount speed, instant guild mail, Mass Resurrection, etc., as exclusive benefits to all guilded players. The guild achievement system, and unlocked items and other benefits through completion of guild achievements, will remain as-is. We'd like to emphasize that system a bit more as a yardstick for collective accomplishment, rather than guild level which primarily just reflects individual effort.<br />
<br />
The Cash Flow perk is obviously popular, though in most guilds it actually contributes less gold to the guild bank than something like Guild Challenges, since it only applies to looted coins. However, it also fuels some degenerate player behavior: if you've made an alt lately, you've probably noticed that you can't go more than a minute or two without receiving a guild invite - typically from &quot;leaders&quot; who are looking to recruit armies of often-unwitting players to both level guilds for later sale, and to increase the amount of Cash Flow gold that is siphoned into coffers to which only they have access. It can be a meaningful amount of gold for one player's pockets, but for something like a raiding guild, Cash Flow gold barely makes a dent in something like total repair costs. We're removing the Cash Flow perk in Warlords. <br />
<br />
We do recognize that it's essential for guilds to have ways of financing their costs, and we will offer alternative, and more lucrative, options for doing so in Warlords (for example, bringing back some Bind on Equip epic drops in raids).<br />
<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor - Death Knight Tier 17 Armor Set<br />
Today we are taking a look at the Death Knight Tier 17 set, added in the latest alpha build.<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor changes things up slightly by using one set of art for Raid Finder, one set of art for Normal and Heroic, and one set of art for Mythic difficulty. You can find the Raid Finder armor sets in our Raid Finder armor sets preview (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3940-Warlords-of-Draenor-Raid-Finder-Armor-Sets-Draenei-Guard-Armor-Set-Blue-Tweets-Art). <br />

Warlords of Draenor - Horde Garrison Preview<br />
The latest alpha build updated the Horde Garrison to show the lower level garrison that everyone starts with, which does not initially include an Orgrimmar portal, mine, fishing area, or other areas from our earlier preview.<br />

Warlords of Draenor - Faction Hubs<br />
Lore let us know (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/483149672832573440) that the cities in Frostfire Ridge and Shadowmoon Valley haven't had any work done to make them into faction hubs.<br />

Warlords of Draenor Theorycraft Discussion<br />
Working on the dummies not showing up on some/all servers. Will try to catch up on this thread again soon; sorry for the slowness. Just swamped this week.<br />
<br />
Last time I tested them, those dummies were acting like normal mobs instead traditional dummies; they kept me in combat even after a minute without perform any attacks, instead of allowing me to leave combat 1 or 2 seconds after no combat action done.<br />
Yes, this is intended. You should still be able to run ~50yd away to drop combat.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Reason being that there are some occasional wonkinesses related to combat and dummies, and we wanted to avoid all of that for your theorycrafting purposes. They're normal mobs that can't die (well, a couple can), and are permanently stunned.<br />
<br />
Specials that are avoided don't give Vengeance/Resolve. It's mostly for a technical reason; auto attacks are much more standardized and so we can just check what the average auto attack would do and based it off of that. Specials can do all kinds of things, so are much harder to reliably handle, and are rare enough that we can handle balancing around them not granting Resolve.<br />
<br />
Has weapon normalization changed? How is the damage stat on the character panel caculated? On live it displays the min/max damage of your current weapon after normalization.<br />
Character sheet has not, and still doesn't, include normalization. Character sheet damage should be simply weapon damage + weapon damage from AP.<br />
<br />
With the auto applied serpent sting for survival hunters does the first tick go off instantly on each application to make up for imp serpent sting being removed?<br />
Currently, yes, though that's effectively an extra SS tick on every Arcane Shot which is kind of hidden. May simplify it out; the Arcane/Multi itself provides instant damage, so we could tune around that.<br />
<br />
The new stat attunements read &quot;You gain 5% more of the X stat from all sources.&quot; However, according to the character sheet, this only amplifies ratings. For example, on a Destruction warlock (who is crit attuned), gaining the 5% crit buff increases your crit by 5%, not 5.25%, and using Dark Soul: Instability grants 30% crit, not 31.5%. Is this intended?<br />
Yes. Subtle distinction between the &quot;Critical Strike&quot; stat, and &quot;X% increased critical strike chance&quot;. All of the attunements are multipliers on your ratings. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/318876-warlords-of-draenor-theorycraft-discussion/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13087818929?page=9#164))<br />

<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
PvE<br />
So 25man raids award relatively more loot than 10man raids. Is this another way to encourage 25manning?<br />
It's a recognition of the logistical challenge of running a larger group. In Warlords the ratio will be constant for all sizes. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/480252913999446016))<br />
<br />
Will 20 Mythic bosses drop 4 items or 5?<br />
Most likely 5. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/480417669041381376))<br />
<br />
Is there max level normal dungeon in Warlords? Currently there aren't any announced for it.<br />
There are 4: Shadowmoon Burial Grounds, Grimrail Depot, UBRS, and &quot;Overgrown Outpost&quot; (name not final). (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/480614395190714368))<br />
<br />
Would like to know this as well. Will N/H flex up to 30?<br />
30 is still the goal for the top-end, pending server performance analysis during beta. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/480837378639003648))<br />
Same for Raid Finder? 2 tanks / 8 heals / 20 DPS?<br />
No, Raid Finder will still matchmake for 25, but can scale down as needed if people drop. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/480881285636685824))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Are you guys even balancing BG teams? Facing off against a team of 6 healers with none in your team sucks.<br />
We are but there might be times when we have to ignore that restriction to get a match going. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/480061438640132096))<br />
<br />
any chance the bg part of the legendary will be removed soon? It's not fun for pve'rs or pvp'ers.<br />
No plans to change the existing Wrathion legendary questline. Definitely lessons learned for the future, though. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/480092959644200960))<br />
<br />
are u going to balance silvershard mines anytime soon? very horde biased.<br />
how is it horde biased? Alliance can get lava first but never tend to go for it in random for some reason. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/480757740881465345))<br />
rated win rates on the map are 50/50. Random tends towards horde even though map is fairly balanced now. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/480759690867912704))<br />
<br />
conquest gear BoE account Wide?<br />
no chance (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/481205546087772160))<br />
I think BoA Conq gear isn't a good fix, but I feel zero compromise isn't an option unless you want alts to die.<br />
Tanking MMR will die. I'm not concerned Alts will die. Because I have alts, and I don't tank MMR. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/481206366770450433))<br />
The majority of people are not comfortable spending 20 minute dampening games to cap an alt with a 20k cap mid season.<br />
Less than 0.5% of games are 20 minutes long. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/481206826931716097))<br />
<br />
For myself I can say that I'll never gear up another character that way and cap 25k points with 180 per win. Thats complete madness<br />
I don't tank MMR when I gear up my alts and I've done this on numerous characters. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/481206068148592644))<br />
I'm helping friends cap at low mmrs on my mage. We need 4-5 hours to cap around 20k points<br />
I'm sorry, but that does not sound like an outrageous amount of time. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/481207021669056514))<br />
How that's not an outrageous amount of time? considering you have NO GEAR and that makes it not fun at all.<br />
4-5 hours to have your character almost fully geared? That's not even a full week of raiding for most people. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/481207772222992387))<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
Can you make all professions give equal benefits including gathering ones, it is annoying to give up a gathering prof for stats.<br />
That's precisely why we're removing the passive stat perks from professions - pick the prof you want, not the optimal one. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/481198936850300929))<br />

Some players negatively view Thrall as Green Jesus or Superman (his real name Go'el doesn't help as it sounds like Kal'el which is Superman's Krytonian name). So I guess they are poking fun at those players with that I am guessing.</div></div><hr />

They didn't remove guild perks. They removed &quot;Guild Levels&quot; The perks will stay but guild levels ultimately served no purpose any more. I think its a good change. all guilds now get the perks he listed in the blue post if you ACTUALLY read it.<br />
<br />
And for the love of god the faction cities thing is not a catastrophe, completely over-blown by the community for no reason. You still get your portals and banks and auctions houses, what's the big deal?</div></div><hr />

If you have even 3 people in your guild, there is no way you aren´t lvl 25 unless you never play those characters.. in which case you are not a guild. I think leveling 3 characters from 85-90 will get an entire guild to 25 as long as you don´t do it by herbing or pet battles.</div></div><hr />

Leveling a guild REWARDS dedication to your game.

Cash flow removed?<br />
<br />

Not sure what you are saying. Repair costs have become fairly trivial over the past few expansions and those who receive the most repair costs are those who receive lots of deaths through PVE. Outside of selling BoEs and raid only craftables for those who can capitalize on the market there is little gold to be gained from raiding and raiding is mostly a consumer of resources that require the support of non-raiding activities. PVP is the only other activity which requires players to support themselves in another activity, but only suffers normal wear and tear durability costs.</div></div><hr />

It had gotten to the point where you were better off finding and joining a big level 25 guild rather than making one for yourself and your friends to play around with, which resulted in each server having just a few big leveling guilds and a few progression guilds.</div></div><hr />

It puts too much emphasis on being in a guild for the perks instead of being in one because you actually enjoy the people in it. It also plays a part in which players are much more reluctant to leave a guild that they're not satisfied with (speaking from personal experience).<br />
<br />
I also agree with the removal of the Cash Flow guild perk. While there's no way the change will completely do away with those extremely irritating mass-spam guild invites, it will at least give less incentive for some to take advantage of others.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has also stressed, countless times, that everything is up in the air and can change at any time while they're developing. Unless you're completely new to how Blizzard does things, making changes like this is par for the course during expansion development, as has been for years. There's a difference between &quot;So Bladespire will basically be your capital city.

<br />
I'm sure it's disappointing to not have Karabor and Bladespire be the faction capitals, but a lot of the the butthurt reactions (not necessarily yours, don't take this personally) are really overblown. I've seriously lost count of the times—going all the way back to Vanilla beta—when Blizzard made some change, and board posters solemnly proclaimed that this would doom WoW and everyone would quit and go play [Everquest II/Rifts/SW:TOR/Wildstar] instead.

From what I can gather, part of the issue here is that there's a considerable discrepancy in time between their decision to make the bases off of Ashran the capitals and the revelation of such data to the public. Lore's comment that little to no work was actually put into Karabor and Bladespire Fortress to make them capitals eludes to them having changed their minds rather early, quite possibly even before pre-orders went up. If that is the case, then it would mean Blizzard was selling a product on false pretenses. Of course this still relies on enough speculation that I wouldn't hold it to absolute truth, it's just what I've been able to gather from reading over the last day or so.</div></div><hr />

It's plausible, but unlikely at best. Placing vendors and such (the things that make an area a city) is almost certainly something they do near the end of development. They have to build the mesh geometry of the whole place first; placing vendors and such would by necessity have to happen later. Furthermore, the final decision to make this change may not have happened until recently, if it was under discussion for a while.<br />
<br />
February: &quot;Let's not start putting NPCs in there yet... we're talking about moving the faction capital somewhere else.&quot;<br />
Feb-May: *internal conversations about where the capitals should be*<br />
May: &quot;Okay, we're going to move the faction capitals to bases outside Ashran. Let's work out how we're going to release this info in a way designed to minimize people going batshit.&quot;<br />
June: *info release happens, everyone flips out*<br />
<br />
Blizzard has given plenty of warning that anything can change during development. If someone wanted to buy a copy as soon as possible, knowing full well that things might change, that's really not Blizzard's problem. (And let's face it; anyone who bought the pre-sale copy a couple of months ago is not likely someone who's going to change their mind about buying WoD. If they were on the fence, why did they buy a copy so early? It's the hardcore fans who buy early. Blizzard would have gotten those sales either way.)<br />
<br />
The idea that they nefariously planned to bait-and-switch is, frankly, laughable. For one thing, the location of the faction capitals in an expansion is not, itself, a particularly strong driver for purchases. (There's not a lot of people who would say, &quot;Eh, I'm not going to buy this expansion... wait, the Alliance capital is Karabor? Sold!&quot;) This isn't to say that it wouldn't be a factor among other things (enough cool points might be enough to sway someone who was on the fence), but Blizzard is not historically in the habit of trying to trick people into buying their games. (Why would they need to be?) The worst plausible scenario is that they were too optimistic about what they planned to do, and didn't couch it in enough &quot;but this might change&quot; warnings. And frankly, anyone who would actually care that Karabor is no longer the Alliance city should know full well that Blizzard might change things.<br />
<br />
Franky, I'm surprised that Blizzard releases as much info as they do during development.

It puts too much emphasis on being in a guild for the perks instead of being in one because you actually enjoy the people in it. It also plays a part in which players are much more reluctant to leave a guild that they're not satisfied with (speaking from personal experience).<br />
<br />
I also agree with the removal of the Cash Flow guild perk. While there's no way the change will completely do away with those extremely irritating mass-spam guild invites, it will at least give less incentive for some to take advantage of others.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you check &quot;Block Guild Invites&quot; you don't get them. I think its a crappy idea to get rid of the perks after guilds spend so much time grinding to get them. They already removed the &quot;Guild Summon&quot; And &quot;Chug-a-lug&quot;<br />
And being in a guild to enjoy the people in it has nothing to do with the other (emphasis on guild perks) that is why there are so many guilds to choose from pick the guild that suits you.</div></div><hr />

I think leveling 3 characters from 85-90 will get an entire guild to 25 as long as you don´t do it by herbing or pet battles.It takes considerably more than that. I have a level 25 alt guild and it took me multiple alt levelings. I really didn't get it all the way to level 25 until my realm was connected to another realm and I got an extra 11 toons I could roll and add to the guild.</div></div><hr />

1.) I know about the block ginvite checkbox, still doesn't change what I stated.<br />
<br />
2.) Blizzard is only getting rid of Cash Flow, not all perks. (I still miss &quot;Have Group, Will Summon&quot; though.)<br />
<br />
3.) Guild levels do have an effect on player behavior. I have seen it myself, I have heard stories from others in cross-realms, I have read about it on websites other than MMO-C. Perhaps your experience has been otherwise, but you're kidding yourself if you think that guild levels didn't factor at all into choices made by players.</div></div><hr />

Oh also imo, instead of throwing out cash flow, why not swap it for something like... repairs cost X% less?</div></div><hr />

Guild leveling was fun when it was new, but later you'd just feel gimped not joining a 25. At the very least I found sub-25 guilds (usually small) to be way more friendly as they wanted to encourage people to stay, knowing perks was such a big deal. That could be positive at least.<br />
<br />
However, this shouldn't really be the time to talk about even more stuff being removed. Guild levels aren't abilities. We can get some fun addition in place of guild levels, can't we?<br />
You'd want to encourage guild loyalty without making it a forced chore.<br />
<br />
Edit: oh and the tier sets... don't worry, no matter what, there will always be people who likes them even if you don't. Do I think the DK set is outstanding? No, but as a &quot;t1&quot; it still has a higher level of detail and work than t1, t4, t7.</div></div><hr />

Placing vendors and such (the things that make an area a city) is almost certainly something they do near the end of development. They have to build the mesh geometry of the whole place first; placing vendors and such would by necessity have to happen later. Furthermore, the final decision to make this change may not have happened until recently, if it was under discussion for a while.<br />
<br />
February: &quot;Let's not start putting NPCs in there yet... we're talking about moving the faction capital somewhere else.&quot;<br />
Feb-May: *internal conversations about where the capitals should be*<br />
May: &quot;Okay, we're going to move the faction capitals to bases outside Ashran. Let's work out how we're going to release this info in a way designed to minimize people going batshit.&quot;<br />
June: *info release happens, everyone flips out*<br />
<br />
Blizzard has given plenty of warning that anything can change during development. If someone wanted to buy a copy as soon as possible, knowing full well that things might change, that's really not Blizzard's problem. (And let's face it; anyone who bought the pre-sale copy a couple of months ago is not likely someone who's going to change their mind about buying WoD. If they were on the fence, why did they buy a copy so early? It's the hardcore fans who buy early. Blizzard would have gotten those sales either way.)<br />
<br />
The idea that they nefariously planned to bait-and-switch is, frankly, laughable. For one thing, the location of the faction capitals in an expansion is not, itself, a particularly strong driver for purchases. (There's not a lot of people who would say, &quot;Eh, I'm not going to buy this expansion... wait, the Alliance capital is Karabor? Sold!&quot;) This isn't to say that it wouldn't be a factor among other things (enough cool points might be enough to sway someone who was on the fence), but Blizzard is not historically in the habit of trying to trick people into buying their games. (Why would they need to be?) The worst plausible scenario is that they were too optimistic about what they planned to do, and didn't couch it in enough &quot;but this might change&quot; warnings. And frankly, anyone who would actually care that Karabor is no longer the Alliance city should know full well that Blizzard might change things.<br />
<br />
Franky, I'm surprised that Blizzard releases as much info as they do during development. They know full well (from years of experience) that whiners on the Internet will complain about changes, pretty much no matter what happens. And if they don't announce anything, then people whine nonstop that they're not releasing any &quot;real&quot; info. They can't win either way.

I think this is spot on. Would it have been cool having the capital cities in karabor/bladespire, most definitively! But I really don't see why the location of where the capitals are determines whether or not someone buys the game.</div></div><hr />

It was fairly obvious to anyone with an iota of common sense that the system would become a &quot;barrier&quot; to new guilds and that the system would create as nearly as many issues as it has solved. The Garrison Grind with its integral ties to WoD content plus its very own version of Guild Perks (per character now instead of per guild) will become a &quot;barrier&quot; to new players in subsequent expansions as well and will require nerfing and/or removal (that's right, you heard it here 1st).<br />
<br />
I admittedly don't have a solution to this issue but there has to be a better way to introduce and keep new features relevant than the same rinse and repeat cycle that sees poorly thought out features introduced that inevitably create new issues and &quot;barriers&quot;.</div></div><hr />

What else are we getting with WoD? Because it seems like it's more removals than additions for an expac.<br />
<br />
If you paid attention and actually did some basic research you could answer the question yourself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cash Flow worked wonders for guild repairs in small/medium-sized guilds. It's a nice way to generate income for your guild and everybody contributed to it.<br />
<br />
This is why we can't have nice things.</div></div><hr />

It destroyed smaller family guilds, which were replaced by massive guilds that had no sense of community.<br />
<br />
I'm glad to see it removed, but the damage has already been done.</div></div><hr />

They're so bland, boring, no color contrast, and not impressive to look at. Thanks for forcing us to build this shit in one zone, and not letting us choose, Blizzard. Assholes.</div></div><hr />
