The Onyxia Loot Table has been updated once again with a few more items, a few of them should be fixed in the next PTR build (Frostforged helms class restriction, Quel'serrar, etc ...) and hopefully more 25-items will be discovered in the future.

Also, I finally took the time to update the loot tables on the Trial of the Crusader boss pages, they should be almost complete now. You can still find a compilation of all the items found in the instance in the Trial of the Crusader Loot List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=870). <br />

Reminder, if you want to use the MMO-Champion tooltips on your site add this anywhere on your site (preferably in the &lt;head&gt;):<br />
<br />
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;http://db.mmo-champion.com/static/js/tooltip_external.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br />
<br />
And ... congratulations, you're done! This files pulls all of the necessary CSS and Javascript file for your tooltips to work out of the box. You can now enjoy linking anywhere on your site, this is the exact same code used on the MMO-Champion front page and it should work relatively well.<br />

Blizzcon Contests Confirmation Emails<br />
We're sending confirmation e-mails right now, as some have noticed. They may continue into tomorrow morning depending on how much coffee we can get our hands on.<br />
<br />
We'll also be sending e-mails to those who didn't get in before the cut off (each contest has a limit for number of entrants) with information about potential on-site sign ups.<br />
<br />
Once we've sent all e-mails we'll let you know. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/25/19110064806-contest-confirmation-emails.html))<br />

Blizzcon 2009 Stream $40 Fee<br />
You're thinking of the WWI (Worldwide Invitational) that was in Paris last year. We've never had streaming coverage of BlizzCon (aside from tournaments). The coverage at WWI was only of the main stage and tournament stage.<br />
<br />
Same as past BlizzCons we're continuing to offer free streaming tournament coverage: http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=18983419351&amp;sid=1 (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=18983419351&amp;sid=1)<br />
<br />
This year we're able to provide the DirecTV coverage streaming that includes things like roving reporters, exclusive interviews, coverage of tournaments and both panel stages, all the events and activities on the show floor, etc. Plus you get a Grunty.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to sell it but I think it's worth explaining they aren't really the same thing. I think it's pretty awesome it's even available this year, personally. I'm glad someone somewhere pushed for it, otherwise yeah... shaky-cam YouTube footage ftw? Notrly.<br />
<br />
I would totally pay $40 to sit home and watch it too, if it meant I could just sit home and watch it. ;) <br />

Gleaming Quel'Serrar class restriction to be changed (Gleaming Quel'Serrar (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49303/gleaming-quelserrar/))<br />
If we created a weapon like this, it would be usable by DKs, if not all sword-users. <br />
<br />
[...] I can't comment on items that have only been described through data-mining, but if we were to drop a one-handed tanking sword in future content, we would let all three sword-using tanks use it.

Blessing of Sanctuary<br />
We do want Sanctuary to be the tanking blessing, and we might end up adding Strength to it to make it play better with the Touched by the Light change. <br />
<br />
[...] We don't want to make it literally an improved Kings. We don't like talents in general that just buff buffs and want to eventually prune them. We want the Prot tree to introduce a new blessing, one that is centered around tanking. If we just changed the talent to a passive buff to Kings, it will be that much harder to go back and change to a new ability.<br />
<br />
The problem with buffing Sanctuary now is that paladin tanks are good (or overpowered, if you trust this forum) so we don't want to just buff BoSanc in order to make it good. Neither do we want to nerf paladins just so BoSanc can buff them back to their current status quo. That feels pretty lame mid-expansion, but is much easier to do later when it just feels like numbers being adjusted as you move forward rather than actually seeing your numbers decrease.<br />
<br />
The Seal slip of mine above is actually funny because the two systems have had similar problems -- either they are niche, in which case the decision on which to use is made at the time of picking your talent spec, or they are situational, in which case nearly one always trumps the others. We hope Seals will be in a better place with the Command change. BoSanc might still needs some work, but we thought looking at paladin cooldowns was a lot more critical for 3.2.

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest<br />
Shadowpriest DPS Range<br />
That’s like saying bosses have armor, so classes that do a lot of magical damage are inherently overpowered. Your weakness in one area (in this case range) is supposed to be made up for by strengths in other areas (say dots ticking while you move). If Shadow priests were at a horrible disadvantage because of their short range, then we’d likely make adjustments. But Shadow does totally reasonable dps on most fights and really high dps on a few. Most raids are thrilled to have Shadow priests. While there are things we can improve with the spec (like we can with every spec), we don't think the range is a huge liability (and you do even have a solution if you can't stand it). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19377968411-glyph-of-mind-flay-fix-question.html))<br />
<br />
Glyph of Mind Flay used to fix a &quot;bad spell&quot;<br />
I see this kind of response a lot, but don’t quite get it. Let’s consider for a moment a glyph that improves your damage. Your class is balanced around the use of that glyph. Why? Because the alternative is you are balanced without that glyph, and then when you take the glyph you do more damage than everyone else. What fun! Yet if glyphs didn't improve damage (or healing or whatever) then they would feel merely cosmetic, like shirts or companion pets. With Mind Flay, you are arguing as if the glyph brings it from a negative number back up to baseline. But that doesn’t really make sense. It is making your spell better – it is a buff.<br />
<br />
Now, where I think there are some valid complaints are on the topic of glyph choice. For DPS specs, someone is going to prove (or strongly suggest) which glyphs provide the most DPS, and raid-focused players are going to tend to take those. It would be nice if you truly had the freedom to pick whatever glyph you wanted. But it would be nice if you truly had the freedom to pick whatever talent specs you wanted too. We'll try to improve both over time, but I don't really get the &quot;I shouldn't have to take that glyph&quot; arguments.

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue<br />
Fan of Knives nerf and Yogg+0<br />
I was saying that I predict we'll nerf Yogg 0 to account for the FoK change. However, even if you never had a rogue doing interrupts, that fight is likely to get easier for everyone as you procure more Coliseum gear.<br />
<br />
Yogg 0 is possible today, but very challenging. Is it possible without FoK interrupts? I honestly don't know. My guess is probably, but even more challenging. Some of that challenge will be offset with new gear.<br />
<br />
I can't imagine there are too many guilds out there who want to try and complete Yogg 0 by only using Ulduar gear who have not already done so. We still try and make achievements that are viable currently -- we would not make an achievement to solo Yogg at this point in time for example.

&gt;_&gt; See, we could see the cheap copy paste art if it wasn't covered by reams of text and the explaining of its own punchline that was two panels ago, which actually led to the creation of a site for people to photoshop in order to fix it, which generally consisted of cutting out a panel and then getting rid about 10 sentences.<br />
<br />
Don't get me started on the miscarriage debacle. <br />

Dinosaur Comics, on the other hand, is very much intentionally copy paste, to the point of being self-aware of it, and at least has intelligent writing full of metafictional devices that most people don't get.<br />

I don't think you'll see many disagree that CAD is using copy pastes a lot, but there are hundreds of comics that use similar techniques to cut down on work time. He's not doing to bad considering his fanbase.<br />

Google Buckley and Something Awful. They have threads and threads discussing quite exactly what the problem with him is and documentation of all the retarded stuff he does and says. Oh, and miscarriage edits. Nobody cares that he copy and pastes art - it's that he does it so artlessly.<br />

To be fair, he's correct in that she didn't drop T1. Tiers in those days referred solely to the sets, as the raid loot level was staggered quite evenly across all the bosses in a 'progression' - Ragnaros drops Tier 2 set pieces as well as higher ilvl items than Ony and several Blackwing Lair bosses , defying your categorization of &quot;Molten core = Tier 1 items&quot; as well as proving that the raid loot ilvl system did not exist in tiers then as it does now. <br />

They have threads and threads discussing quite exactly what the problem with him is and documentation of all the retarded stuff he does and says. Oh, and miscarriage edits. Nobody cares that he copy and pastes art - it's that he does it so artlessly.<br />
<br />
<br />
In his own way he's a genius. Intentional or unintentional.<br />
Sure, half the internet hates him, but he's put into principle one of the biggest points in advertising.<br />
&quot;Even negative advertising, is still advertising&quot; - And he's getting good money off that fact.<br />
<br />
If all his &quot;haters&quot; would simply have left the site to die and ignored him, the site would have been gone off the internet years ago. In effect, all the hate is what's actually keeping the site alive, rather than the opposite. It's kind of funny, and I can respect that whole &quot;Screw what others think, and keep doing stuff your own way&quot; mentality.<br />
<br />
Bigger than cheeses (http://www.biggercheese.com/index.php?comic=813) did some good fun edits bytheway.<br />
Heck, most of the internet did some freaky edits of his comic pages. <br />
He's a figure or the internet, for good or worse, the resulting drama is worth some laughs if anything. <br />
<br />
Stop and think for a moment though. <br />
Do you genuinely hate him, or are you just following another &quot;let's all hate Tim&quot; - internet meme ?<br />
For most people, I suspect it's the latter.<br />
I'm not saying he's the most awesome amazing person on the internet, by all means I suspect he's genuinely a dick. But, people should make their own opinion, rather than have others create that opinion for them. Everyone hates Tim, because most others do as well. Like sheep.<br />

I can only speak for myself, but I don't even think about him, as a person, enough to hate him. I'm in the camp which has progressed past &quot;wow he is a detestable person&quot; to &quot;fetch me popcorn, the train is still burning and it warms my soul&quot;. I would not change B^U for the world, for he has - honestly - brought me some of the deepest laughs I have ever had, as well as provided hours of entertainment. Not through his art alone, or intentionally, as he would like to, but it still ultimately came from him.<br />
<br />
The comic Boub posted is probably a good barometer for what level you appreciate B^U at. If you went &quot;NO BUCKLEY&quot; then you're an idiot who judges art by the artist and are probably of the most shallow understanding of why he has his reputation. If you had a nice chuckle or even a smirk, Buckley would probably like you to visit his forums until he inevitably bans you for a mild disagreement. If, like me, you rent your chest while bellowing to the skies WORDS WORDS WORDS then you're actually enjoying the ineptitude with which he wields his artform, not disliking him or his art.<br />

Tim Buckley does not know how to take criticism<br />
He does not know how to tell a joke<br />
He does not know how to create a convincing plot arc<br />
He does not know how to *move* said plot arc at a pace faster than tectonic plate shifting<br />
He does not know how to write a convincing conversation between two human beings<br />
He does not know how to draw a facial expression besides B^U<br />
He does not know how to actually show any of the events in the plot, you always hear about whatever it is that happened after the fact<br />
He does not know how a normal relationship works, (Ethan v. Lilah, Ethan v. Lucas, Ethan v. anyone else)<br />
He does not know how to QA work that's supposed to be in his own name (CAD animated series)<br />
He does not know how to relate to his fans<br />
He does not know how to manage a WoW guild<br />
He does not know how to write a gaming webcomic beyond namedropping random releases at random points in conversations<br />
Speaking of conversations, he does not know how to write without taking up half the comic in gigantic, over-explanatory speech bubbles with 300 more words than are necessary<br />
He does not know how to be original<br />
He does not know how to manage a WoW guild<br />
<br />
And, lastly ...<br />
<br />
He does not know how to keep it in his pants (The Jackie Incident)<br />

Grow up a lil bit before trying one huge frontal attack, those need to be pretty well crafted for its author not to look bad.<br />

<br />
No, it's not a copy-paste of every romance in every media, because his portrayal of Lilah is completely out of character. It's completely unfathomable why the woman would stay with such an immature, unambitious, unsympathetic and selfish human being. Somehow everything ends up being Lilah's fault.<br />
<br />
And this sheer lack of believable characterization extends to practically everyone else. Why is Christian considered the &quot;bad guy&quot; for someone who donates an entire hospital wing? That's not asshattery, that's philanthropy. What did Tob ever do to earn Ethan's derision besides playing Counterstrike a lot? How the hell is that different from the large amounts of WoW?<br />
<br />
Even if we divorce ourselves from the actual plot, the plot itself is moving at a snail's pace. Ethan's brother Rory* is coming to the wedding. The new robot** is plotting to kill the humans. Their &quot;fake&quot; wedding is coming up. Ethan is trying to manage his gaming store by himself. None of these plots are being resolved. In over 3 months of comics, the story has barely moved a week.<br />
<br />
Stepping away from the plot some more, how about the art? If Tim isn't using a background lifted from Google Image Search plus a gaussian blur, he's drawing couches three times too big, windows with both blinds AND curtains and shadows with no explainable light source, and all of them lacking the basic concept of perspectives and vanishing points, giving the impression that the comic is taking place is some MC Escher-esque house.<br />
<br />
The drawings of the characters themselves? The mouths aren't centered (and never change), their head size changes randomly from panel to panel, their eyebrows have been glued to their foreheads and somehow the women have bigger crotch-bulges than the men.<br />
<br />
* It is never explained why he is angry at Rory<br />
<br />
** It is never explained why this new robot Embla, or even Zeke, actually hates humans, except the fact that they're rip-offs of both HK-47 and Futurama's Bender.</div></div><hr />

Oh, and just to try and rebunk some of this... err... discussion, Buckley knows how to draw. He has talent. But the problem is... he is way too fucking lazy to utilize his abilities.

Maybe my sense of humor is twisted or whatnot, but I did not find the comic even remotely funny. Please Boub, don't post this crap on your frontpage anymore, it isn't worthy of this website, or in fact, any website.</div></div><hr />

I guess my point was just to flame Teh Gladiators. I think it tries way too hard, and I don't find it entertaining by any means. But yes, it does have great art. And don't get me wrong, I'm not claiming CAD is good :P It's been terrible for years. I figured it displayed my disgust for Teh Gladiators by claiming it was better :D<br />
<br />
But judging by your posts, I hope you dislike Dark Legacy then. If anything, DL is the epitome of lazy work. But the content is great. It's amazing what terrible line art, with some very impressive and funny facial expressions can do for a comic. Some of the DL comics are incredibly lame.. but I still go back every week for a new one.<br />
<br />
It's funny really, this &quot;hatred&quot; for CAD seems very similar to the hatred towards Richard Knack(sp?). It just seems like perpetuated hatred based on some failures/feelings from the past. I make this assertion by the fact that people are referring to the author of the comic, not necessarily the comic itself. <br />

<br />
Teh Gladiators and Dark Legacy are sort of like polar opposites. TG gets the art quite well, but could use a better writer.<br />
<br />
DL on the other hand can tell a joke well, but the art is very &quot;stylized&quot;, to put it delicately.<br />
<br />
Going back to CAD, it's both. Tim Buckley needs to hire himself an editor to trim his overly words and hire an artist to improve on his terribly stale art. (Then he needs to let other people continue CAD altogether ...)</div></div><hr />

This right here is the main problem, imo.<br />
<br />
Not that I think you're right, but the fact that people who don't like Tim or CAD just can't leave them alone.<br />
<br />
Tim made the comic. For bad or for worse, it's his comic... his decision where to take the plot, his decision on how long it will take, his decision on character development (if any).<br />
<br />
He presents a product, you either like it or don't. If you don't, just don't go there anymore.<br />
<br />
This constant flaming and bashing of Tim and CAD is indeed unbelievable, because it defies a very simple principle of logic: &quot;if you don't like it, stay the fuck away from it&quot;.<br />
<br />
Easy and saves everyone else a lot of headaches.<br />
<br />
Personally, I like CAD for some of the punchlines. It's not a great comic, but it's enjoyable to some degree. And that's it. I go there on a daily basis while it still entertains me in the slightest. The day it ceases to do that for me, easy... I will just stop going there.</div></div><hr />

I don't hate DLC at all. The art is the last thing I could ever object there. Why? Because the guy seems to be pushing his limits, if you look at his sequential progression, and heck, it is his own style, he has centered to it over the long time he's been doing it, and the writing totally makes up for any artistic flaws. Same goes for Gladiators - if the writing is weak, it is totally backed up by the art style.<br />
<br />

I didn't get neither this, nor the previous comic posted about the same issue. One thing I noticed, though, was the extreme cheapness of art. You see, comics are a visual medium. If your comic is just some blurbs or stickfigures in the same static pose for three panels with one minor difference between them, just write a fucking blog. That is not a comic. That's just, fuck I don't know, a bad pun dressed up as a comic. And again, Buckley is capable of far better work. But he doesn't see you worthy of it, so have this, smile, praise him and ask for more. Enjoy.</div></div><hr />

How would you feel if Joe McRandom wrote &quot;I don't think the SA rumors about Cataclysm are true&quot; on his blog and somehow that one quote made it onto MMO-Champion?<br />
<br />
Because that's what this &quot;comic&quot; is, a blog post. It's not Ethan doing something goofy, or Ethan in a humorous situation*, it's just Tim Buckley speaking directly to his audience on how he feels about the Cataclysm, as channeled through a character that's Tim Buckey's Mary-Sue self-insert anyway.<br />
<br />
Even if we set aside everything else about CAD and viewed this one, 3-frame comic strip in a vacuum, it would still be terrible, because it's not a comic strip. It's a blog post.<br />

I love the daily sillies that he has. They are 3 panels long and usually seem to show what Tim's thinkin about. If that's a blog to you then I'd like more people to blog like that. It's funny.<br />

<br />
Let's sort some things out before, shall we?<br />
<br />
There's the webcomic... and then there are the sillies.<br />
<br />
The webcomic is for his storyline, with the random &quot;OOC&quot; component.<br />
<br />
The sillies have long since declared themselves as more than &quot;blog posts&quot; or &quot;vents&quot; for what Tim is thinking on day-to-day basis. Besides the usual characters, himself and Pierre have made appearances in the sillies. They're just that... silly.<br />
<br />
Now Tim thought up of something. Right or wrong, he decided to use his webpage to do so. It's his right.<br />
<br />
Boubouille saw it and decided to post it on his webpage. It's his right.<br />
<br />
It's not you or anyone else that gets to decide what Tim or Boubouille decide to post. You may not like it and it's your own right to let the authors know... but please, a debate on a public forum over how that ONE strip is &quot;unworthy&quot; of being on MMO's frontpage, because you personally don't like it or the author... now that's ridiculous.<br />
<br />

I can imagine your face turning blue with anger and hatred the first time you watched Warner Bros cartoons; &quot;WHAT THE FUCK WHO CREATED THIS SHIT THAT BUNNY SHOULDA DIE LONG AGO&quot;. :D<br />
<br />
<br />
And this sheer lack of believable characterization extends to practically everyone else. Why is Christian considered the &quot;bad guy&quot; for someone who donates an entire hospital wing? That's not asshattery, that's philanthropy. What did Tob ever do to earn Ethan's derision besides playing Counterstrike a lot? How the hell is that different from the large amounts of WoW?<br />
<br />
No one but Ethan (for jealousy) and you (for retardness) said Christian was the bad guy. The story's more subtil than that. And for Tob, few lines in the comic support your idea that Ethan's hate for him is a bit strong. Tho, I you were a bit more gifted in the brain area, you would understand people just hate listening to Tob not because he likes X, but because he likes it too much that he's not able to bring it every two words in a conversation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Even if we divorce ourselves from the actual plot, the plot itself is moving at a snail's pace. Ethan's brother Rory* is coming to the wedding. The new robot** is plotting to kill the humans. Their &quot;fake&quot; wedding is coming up. Ethan is trying to manage his gaming store by himself. None of these plots are being resolved. In over 3 months of comics, the story has barely moved a week.<br />
<br />
Where is the line in your imaginary Comic Rules Guide claiming a comic should be:<br />
<br />
- evolving at real life speed<br />
- fast paced ?<br />
<br />
I also wonder if in that Guide, that specific rule applies to FREE comics.<br />
<br />
<br />
Stepping away from the plot some more, how about the art? If Tim isn't using a background lifted from Google Image Search plus a gaussian blur, he's drawing couches three times too big, windows with both blinds AND curtains and shadows with no explainable light source, and all of them lacking the basic concept of perspectives and vanishing points, giving the impression that the comic is taking place is some MC Escher-esque house.<br />
<br />
The drawings of the characters themselves? The mouths aren't centered (and never change), their head size changes randomly from panel to panel, their eyebrows have been glued to their foreheads and somehow the women have bigger crotch-bulges than the men.<br />
<br />
I can give you that. Actually, I'm not sure I agree, because I simply don't care about the art. It's shitty, yes. So I guess that when you went to Paris to see the Joconde, you claimed out loud &quot;WOW THAT IS SUCH A LOOSY STORY GAIS&quot; ? Oh, right. You didn't. Because art is about art, and comics are about telling a story/jokes. Not about having nice drawings.<br />
<br />
The way I can so easily destroy every point you came with leads me to think you have something against the author that you won't express. Maybe he ninja'd you, left you IG, disapointed you for something else. And you're probably right to have feeling toward that. But this is hypocrite to project that on his work. Grow up and you'll realise someone can be a total douche and still do a decent/good job, even making you laugh.</div></div><hr />

Most people don't dislike him because of some silly 4chan thing noone cares about but because the way he handles any critasism, which is normaly somthing like &quot;Do you know who I AM!!1&quot;. Also still that Odd question hanging over him. Lets call it the MJ debate.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Brevity is the soul of wit&quot; - Shakespeare.<br />
<br />
What you quoted there is one of many flaws that CAD has. Overexplaining the joke and why it is funny is not good writing. It is just making a mess with a pen and treating your audience as a bunch of retards that can't even understand jokes, so you have to explain them step by step why it is funny. A dictionary has loads of text in it too, but somehow it is not seen as a comedy book.</div></div><hr />

Dark legacy i think is hilarious the writer really has a good sense of how to tell a joke<br />
ive never seen this CAD before the 3 panel strip posted here and TBH its a great little sum up of the current climate on wow forums and sums up the mood of the time period whilst being funny and to go into a huge long wall of text explanation on why teh writer of it sucks is just a bit pointless lets stick to discussing the 1 comic we have here and not go into the back story on who wrote it and what else he has written<br />
also tim buckley you say? as in the musician from the 60's who died and had a son called jeff buckley who also became a musician and died or is this guy just happen to have same name?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, CAD is authored by Tim Buckley the 60s musician who is dead.</div></div><hr />

It's not like you got proof... Just more hearsay.<br />
<br />
/sheep<br />
<br />
<br />
The proof is available on the web. I'd post the picture but I have a feeling thats bad. You can find it with some simple googling.<br />
<br />
So yeah, he's a creepy Pedo.</div></div><hr />

Will I explain to you that there are different kind of criticism ? You seem to be willing to appear clever, quoting and all. Aren't you able by yourself to understand that you can't really criticise for being too slow something you don't pay ?<br />
<br />
Are you that kind of people that will ask your neighbour to help you doing some task and then shouting at them how slow they are ? It seems you are, if you really think you can blame a comic that is free from any form of payment of even inscription, for being slow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
None of the new Blacksmithing or Leatherworking patterns are on the current loot list. One dropped last night and thought it might be helpful to the moderators if they were looking to update their loot list. Think a little bit.</div></div><hr />
