The site's name isn't &quot;MMORPG champion,&quot; now is it?<br />
<br />
The MMO affix only implies that its content is massively multiplayer and online. And all three afformentioned titles count.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course, that's all mindless pedantism anyway. This is a forum dedicated to world of warcraft that features news from other blizzard properties as well. That should be pretty clear by now.</div></div><hr />

Since when? In D3 only 4 ppl can be in the same world in any given time..hardly massive...HS? Even less ppl....HotS? 8 or 10 ppl? OVerwatch? Not even close......Or you imply any co-op game is mmo as well? Hint: &quot;A massively multiplayer online game (MMOG or MMO) is an online game which is capable of supporting large numbers of players, typically from hundreds to thousands, simultaneously in the same instance (or world)&quot;<br />
But anyway..plenty of other and significant mmo exist, but just how many times can you see any information about them? The site is more like Blizz-champion instead of MMO....Nothing wrong with it, but hands down, it`s misleading or to put it simple, even the name of the site is a fat lie....</div></div><hr />

Who the fuk cares how the site is named? In my country theres site called PCLab, gues what? They do not test and post only about PC computers but also about consoles, tablets, smartphones. Should we also call them liars because tablets, smartphones and other devices are not listed in the adress and site name? Its just hilarious. There always were news from other games like SWTOR, GW2, Wildstar and every other Blizzard game. They can post whatever they like and I think most users prefer some news there and there form other titles than no news at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would guess After Effects or something like that - there's no actual animation in them, and a lot of the special effects I've seen with plug ins. I'd guess they start with the drawn art and import it into AF, add the soundtrack, and start moving the pieces around.<br />

I have a bad news for you..smartphones and tablets considered as pc per definition:&quot;A smartphone is a mobile personal computer with an advanced mobile operating system with features useful for mobile or handheld use&quot; and &quot;A tablet is a type of portable PC that de-emphasizes the use of traditional input devices (such as a mouse or keyboard) by using a touchscreen display, which can be controlled using either a stylus pen or finger.&quot; therefore tablets as well...In fact consoles, as they built from common computerparts (cpu, gfx card, mobo, etc) considered as pc. &quot;A video game console is an electronic, digital or computer device that outputs a video signal or visual image to display a video game that one or more people can play.&quot;<br />
FYI pc means personal computer and probably you are too young to know, but even the old ZX81 or C64 was a pc too...<br />
<br />
Free education, just for now :P</div></div><hr />

With your logic every mentioned game here is RPG so whats the problem?<br />
<br />
BTW PCLab also post news about games, sites and technologies, those are also PC now?</div></div><hr />
