With a hotfix a few minutes ago, we’ve made it so that Fighting on Two Fronts no longer requires looting the Mechagon Fight Club chest.<br />
The difficulty of this step as a requirement for upgrading Ripple in Space was out of line compared to other parts of the achievement.<br />
We’ll note this in our next hotfixes update.<br />

Those 8 listed are the Drill rares. Relevant to the fact that Drill construction was available at the time.</div></div><hr />

Ugh that's really annoying then. All my other mounts are working just fine but he's flying slow as fuck.<br />

<br />
Caustic Mechaslime (6), Gorged Gear-Cruncher (15), The Kleptoboss (33) share spawn in the same tunneling-network that has three different entrances. Drill rig daily needs to be up to see any of them. Blizz-RNG may make some rarer than others so happy hunting realm-jumping! So far on EU-Khadgar I've only come across mechaslime these past two weeks.</div></div><hr />

Why is the map irrelevant to people outside NA?<br />

I don't understand this map.<br />

Why are there numbers? I know they mark where the rares are, but why numbers?<br />
Why are the numbers in such a weird order?</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. And when Alliance players complained they were told to fuck off, it wasn't that big a deal, he can't even fly after all.<br />
<br />
Lol.<br />
<br />
But hey all you have to do is pay for a boost, level them up, grind for a rare drop, do the questline, and then you too can have it. But fear not, the bee mount will PROBABLY be faction semi-exclusive too and they won't just make it a drop because the Horde player base is what keeps the lights on in Irving California.</div></div><hr />
