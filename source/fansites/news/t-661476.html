General Vezax Encounter Changes<br />
We wanted to make players aware of several changes made to the General Vezax encounter upon the release of patch 3.2, which weren't noted in the official patch notes.<br />
<br />
These changes affect both 10-player and 25-player modes. First off, when considering the hardmode of the encounter, the mechanics were overly favoring groups that made heavy use of Restoration druids (Omen of Clarity procs) and “Enhancement” shamans using healing gear (Shamanistic Rage and Improved Stormstrike) to circumvent the mana restrictions. Omen of Clarity will no longer proc for Restoration druids, and Enhancement shamans receive a healing debuff similar to the ones Retribution paladins have had since the encounter’s initial implementation.<br />
<br />
Recognizing that this would make the encounter far more difficult for raid groups that have come to rely on those mechanics, we also made changes to ease the overall mana burden when attempting the hardmode. The health of General Vezax and the Saronite Animus was reduced by roughly 25%, and the Animus will now spawn after six Vapors, down from eight, assuming none have been killed.<br />
<br />
In addition, prior to 3.2, General Vezax could be very erratic in the use of some of his abilities, leading to long gaps between Shadow Crashes in particular. His behavior in this regard is now more consistent. As a side-effect of this change, in 25-player mode in particular, he will also cast Searing Flames slightly more often – whenever his Fire school isn’t locked out by player interrupts, essentially. Finally, because the “more consistent” Crash use ended up being a bit on the frequent side, a minor hotfix recently increased the period between Crash casts.</div></div><hr />

Well done for self-owning yourself as a clueless moron. Try to actually understand a statement from Blizzard before you suggest that nerfs have happened. You might want to, for example, examine how Omen of Clarity and Lifebloom work together for a Resto Druid in relation to the Vezax encounter...<br />

Dumb enough to need multiple posts on a topic that was an obviously exaggerated number. I guess unless he started counting fights like Iron Council 3 bosses and Illidari Council 4 bosses, etc, throw a couple HKM fights and there you go, 25+ &quot;bosses&quot; in a single instance.</div></div><hr />

At the end of his orginal post he wrote (Yes it will be that big). That´s not sarcasm.<br />
<br />
And after all I believed him that we will see 31 or more bosses because IC will be the last xp for a long time. My understanding of IC is:<br />
<br />
1. 6 Modes (5, 5 heroic, 10, 10 heroic, 25, 25 heroic)<br />
2. 6 Tier sets (all look the same with differnet stats)<br />
3. differnt wings like naxx<br />
4. It will not be possible to clear IC within one night. Normal guils must expand the ID<br />
5. We will see a lot of new things within raids....whatever that means</div></div><hr />

We did it last night and we could make it with 2 groups as he casts it exactly every 10 seconds I think. So my cd was just rdy and i pressed it. I had to hold back on my damage so I always had rage to interrupt though.</div></div><hr />

I recall a while back when GC was addressing Shaman community concerns that Chain Heal wasn't as useful as a spell anymore. GC made a post something like &quot;a quick look at the numbers of a few very skilled world top end resto shaman shows CH is a very used spell&quot; and the entire frakking community exploded into &quot;Who is this man!?&quot; &quot;I demand a goddamned ARMORY!&quot; and &quot;GIVE US A NAME RAAAAUUGGHHH!&quot; SO badly, that the entire purpose of his comment was lost.</div></div><hr />

Read the way he phrased it, almost as an aside to his main point about tanking niches. If he was trying to be funny or dry, he completely missed the mark and its no wonder people started to get excited.<br />

<br />
<br />
Why no shamans - we usually have two rogue+shaman teams interupting the cast. Shamans interupt cooldown ist 6 secs and they have a bigger range - rogues have to be in melee range - sometimes when general moves really fast so that a melee range interrupter can't reach him on time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh...people still kite Vezax?<br />
<br />
The point people are making is you don't need 3 interrupters. Just use a couple Rogues/Fury Warriors. I go DPS on that fight as our DK tanks him and just interrupt with one of our Rogues. It's a little faster, but nothing too major post-3.2. The fight is extremely easy now with the health nerf and more frequent shadow crashes.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keoren</div><div class="date">2009-08-12, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well look at it this way, he got buffed for more searing flames, got buffed so druids and shammys arent as great at the fight anymore... and NERFED with a 25% reduction to both his hp and his adds hp and the add spawns faster now... meaning less time to wait, therefore.... mana can be thrown around a bit more freely.<br />
<br />
<br />
Unless people get hit by crashes or are slow at marks, mana shouldn't be a problem for the healers anyways so the &quot;buffs&quot; to the boss are nearly meaningless, unless you absolutely based your tactic on them. You can use the 7th and the 8th vapors anyways now, which you couldn't before.<br />
<br />
You can consider this as a straight health and rng nerf. They are not just compensation for the other changes.</div></div><hr />

I realize that he is supposed to heal a lot if players don't move away in the right direction quickly, but it still seems a bit over the top and you can't completely avoid the draining. An example of a change would be the life-leech 3-5 seconds after being applied. This would mean that players with fast reactions would be able to avoid any life-draining at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Me too, considering it should last 8-10 months.<br />
<br />
But ppl would whine then when you cannot clear them in 1 week (and they will hate the extended raid lockout)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Vezax is buffed since last week... we got surprised first when crashes and marks spawned 3 times faster than usual... but we just smacked him after that...<br />
honestly, it's easier this way.<br />
lower hp on both mobs, animus spawning faster, better crashes = faster fight / low mana usage. :P</div></div><hr />

And yes Det...people are going to QQ about not being able to finish the raid in a week. Of course people QQ about everything so that is to be expected.</div></div><hr />

FOR BADDIES WHO CANT/DONT WANT TO CLEAR THE WHOLE PLACE EACH WEEK AND WANT TO SIT ON ONE BOSS FOR PROGRESSION, NOT BECAUES THE ENORMITY OF THE INSTANCE REQUIRES THAT ONE WEEK IS SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH TIME TO GET TO ARTHAS.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dreary</div><div class="date">2009-08-12, 07:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believed GC. 31 bosses makes sense when you think about how little work has been put into the past few patches, most of the additions were removing in-game features (cooking spices anyone?) rather than actually adding anything new. Naxx was recycled, two of the raids have only 1 boss for !@#$'s sake, the coliseum is a joke, etc.<br />
<br />
31 bosses made sense since it would have meant they were working on ICC this whole time and that's why the previous patches were so lackluster. After hearing 31 bosses I could actually log into the game again without getting bored. To now hear GC was lying is simply reinforcing the fact that I will not be renewing my subscription and will even more vehemently tell my friends to stay away from this childish rip-off game (as if anyone with half a brain needs any convincing these days).</div></div><hr />

Gullible people believed it. If you happen to know anyone in RL that believed it, the next time you see them tell them the word gullible is written on their ceiling, I bet they will look up to check.<br />
<br />
Those of us that are capable of thinking for ourselves saw it for the sarcasm it was.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now its probably gonna be 3 vehicle fights and 2 other unnamed remodeld skin bosses before Arthas, with a variation of 10 diffrent difficulties from retard to paid gamer 1 boss every month.<br />
<br />
Also bonus boss will include Ozzy Osbourne who you only can reach with a WoW TCG code since we all know blizz leech for money from the e-peen seekers aint enough.</div></div><hr />

@changes: 25% Less health to both vezax and the saronite dingleberry? nice, maybe our guild will do him hardmode soon =D</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The change to Searing Flames was interesting. We usually go with a 2 team interupt rotation with 2 people in each team but after 3.2 he was casting Searing Flames consistently before the interrupts had come off CD's. Had to use 3 interrupting teams to ensure success.<br />
<br />
<br />
We are interrupting him with 2 players (Rogues) and it is very easy, pushes the DPS down ... but you dont have to communicate with 6 people</div></div><hr />

took like 3 hours, but I bet you spend that 4 hours and 5 days a week trolling trade and being terrible. Is running around in dalaran while people raid for 4 hours a day better?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where were your comments about how easy his &quot;sarcasm&quot; was to recognize in the MMO post that announced it in the first place!? Clearly something was muddled in the meaning or Boubou wouldn't have put it up there in the first place.<br />
<br />
Sure some of you guys were skeptical, but none of you guys that I saw, were confident enough in your convictions to actually post it in the face of how things were, that is: Ghostcrawler confirming that &quot;Yes, there will be that many bosses.&quot;<br />
<br />
What on earth is misleading about that?<br />
<br />
Now that I've said my mean words, we're 1:1. Let's keep em to ourselves till we have the backbone to stand up against what is the widely accepted opinion. Toodles.</div></div><hr />
