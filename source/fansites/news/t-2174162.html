This. It feels really frustrating specially as pure DPS class that might, or might not, get major buffs or nerfs. Like currently im 44 / 34 / 20 traits on weapons.<br />
I'd rather focus getting that 44 up and up. But what if 7.2. will nerf it to levels of &quot;unplayble for months&quot; and the 20 trait one gets major buffs? Yeah gl switching to it specially after those extra AP talents.<br />
<br />
I wouldnt even mind bit longer grind IF it would go to all 3 weapons. Seeing as NH is already &quot;balanced for 35 traits&quot; (or more if mythic)</div></div><hr />

Considering if you build your weapon a certain way (that is, you forego ALL of the utility talents) you cap out your weapon's nominal base power at around Lv.25 or 26. If you think, other than the flat damage boost, that your weapon is that much weaker it may as well be trash it is BECAUSE you picked up all the utility talents.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right, but where does that leave players like myself who actually enjoy m+?<br />
At the moment is a damn struggle to get people to go to them, and with the &quot;planned&quot; hit to AP coming, it'll be basically impossible.<br />
It'll just shift from &quot;hey, good affixes this week, let's grind some AP&quot; to &quot;I ran my +__ this week already&quot;.<br />
Gutting content because people complain about &quot;being forced to do it&quot; is just going to make those same people complain that &quot;there's nothing to do outside of raids&quot;.<br />
A good portion of my gametime right now is spent in M+.<br />
I might be the minority here, but if this change goes live my playtime will drop drastically as a result, and I know, &quot;if you enjoy mythic plus so much, why would you run them less just because you get less rewards?&quot;, well it's the same reason I don't power through D3 story mode on t13, can I do it? -- sure, is it a good time value investment? -- hell no.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The way I understood it but I certainly could be wrong is that there will be one very high AP reward that week and then they'll continue to reward AP just not anywhere near the initial reward. Or maybe like One high AP reward per lvl +2, 3, 4 etc. That way people aren't just running 6-9 all day. Higher rewards means going farther.<br />
<br />
Edit: nope nevermind listening to it again it does sound like just one big reward from weekly chest. But you can still make AP gains just not as much as before.</div></div><hr />

The system looks at how many legendary items you have that would drop for your spec, so if you switch specs the system will know how many legendary items that work for that spec. If you don't have any for that spec, you will have a higher chance to get one.<br />
<br />
What about Priaz &amp; Sephuz? If my warrior prot got both of them, when patch 7.2 will hit, will they be considered &quot;all specs got 2 legendaries each&quot;, &quot;no spec got a legendary&quot;, or &quot;tank spec got 2 legendaries&quot;? And what about cross spec legendaries, like the Execute ring (For both Arms and Fury, but not for Prot as prot doesn't have execute)?</div></div><hr />

I kind of read that too at first, but got a bit put off by the 2 million for 20 number.<br />
I mean, honestly, I'll just have to wait until the numbers are finalized, otherwise I'll just wing up working myself into a tizzy over nothing.<br />

<br />
Heaven forbid they make something not a bloody grindfest in the clusterfuck of an expansion. I never cared for the mythic+ system but apparently I now have to do a mythic 15 on 12 different characters if I want to get the skins... Imo they just need to tie that tiers of skins to account wide achievements i.e &quot;Random achievement name - complete the following in this tier. Rewards - Account wide skins for this tier&quot; They can even just leave the &quot;balance of bullshit&quot; quest as a pre-req to unlock it on alts if they are that hard up to make them do something. <br />
<br />
<br />
Artifact appearances are just a cosmetic unlock, so being as alt friendly isn't as important as things that make it harder to play the current content.<br />
<br />
Yeah, let's make the content &quot;harder&quot; when its already a drag to play. <br />
<br />
I digress, I'll wait to see the changes but if they don't change their minds on at least the skins, I'll probably take my leave from WoW.</div></div><hr />

See that's the thing. Until Blizzard goes indepth into the behind the scenes of the specifics involving legendaries, I don't see very much improvement on the opinion side of the community. Frankly doing anything short of remastering the whole system is a waste of time for the majority of people I talk to about these things.<br />
<br />
And yeah, their idea behind making the AP grind exponential, then have the balls to say &quot;If you don't want the extra stats you could always use GOOOLLLLDDDDD&quot;.<br />
<br />
Yeah, that's what I want to spend my time doing, choosing between +2str+2stam or 25 gold. Vaniller is so gud guys amirite?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I always liked playing alts. playing alts was always fun, because i was able to help friends with different alts such as a tank or a healer.<br />
with legion i started again as enhancement shaman, i felt pretty good. rotation was good and smooth. it was just a bit awkward to see people dealing 5k more dps than i did with 10 less ilvl or more even.<br />
now... we have dps rng on top of its peak. an enhancement shaman from another guide, same gear as i have, pulled 200k dps more than i did on trillax. he had over a 30 sec less fight time 28 additional proccs compared to me... i had 26... and that is just a joke tbh!<br />
<br />
the ap grind stops me from playing an alt, rerolling to another dps character.<br />
in my opinion i am atm not sure if im either playing a gambling game or a mmorpg.<br />
<br />
i didnt mention the legendarys... but that is obvious.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not just blizzard but everyone because the player base is just impossible to understand what the fuck it wants.<br />
<br />
It has around say 4-5 million players each seemingly wanting 20 million different designs that are simply put fucking incompatible with each other and the so called happy medium will just piss off everyone.<br />
<br />
If someone made a thread asking to make the perfect wow it would end up being like.<br />
<br />
A game you can log into and raid but at the same time have means to get mythic level gear super duper easy outside of raids.<br />
A place where you can stop grinding at max level but at the same time have means to always becoming better than before by just playing.<br />
A place where there is just one difficulty of super hard raid. But in reality has about 20 difficulties between LFR and Mythic triple plus<br />
Dungeons which last all expansion while at the same time offer nothing to anyone who has been in raids.<br />
A place where you can get everything done on reset day, but also offering new increases in power so that those who can't log on on reset day don't get fucked over.</div></div><hr />

That's what I've been saying about raiding for years now.<br />
Everything else in this game has been turned into a funnel designed to shunt players towards raiding, out of a desperate desire to try and keep the new blood flowing in to prop the entire system up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raone</div><div class="date">2017-02-23, 09:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm confused as to why they're deincentivising mythic+.<br />
They want to make the game less grindy, so they're making everything time-gated grindy instead?<br />
No longer can you spend the weekend hammering out mythic + with friends to get ap, now you're better off running one high m+ and then what, logging out until raid?<br />
<br />
They aren't though? They are de-ncentivising spamming easy low level mythic+'s (like only running Maw/Dark Heart) and giving longer mythics+ more ap and harder mythics+ even more ap. They've done this TBC (nerfing heroic mech while buffing the other heroics). Longer Mythic will give more AP, and the harder Mythic+ you do the more AP you will get. It will still be FAR more lucrative to spam Mythic+s over raiding for AP, just it won't be as rewarding to do the easy/fast/short ones anymore, and far more rewarding to do harder/longer ones.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dvaldin</div><div class="date">2017-02-23, 09:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, according to the data, &quot;For the vast majority of players, the current system is working okay, they just take the Artifact Power as it comes.&quot;<br />
<br />
If it's working okay for most players, changing it has a chance to piss the &quot;vast majority of players&quot; off. Maybe it won't, but I think if it's working pretty much as intended, it's not going to go over well.<br />
<br />
But, you know, it took a freaking decade to learn regular content updates was a better strategy to keep players engaged than attempting to put out expansions faster. Whatever, Bliz. I don't understand the logic a lot of the time.</div></div><hr />

There's a lot of realism sacrificed for the sake of gameplay. That stance they took comes off weird when considering many other things in WoW. I believe they just wanted it to take more time, and couldn't just say so for some reason.<br />
<br />
That explanation really bugs me. It would be universally appreciated so they can't argue that &quot;it feels weird&quot;. Just say that you still believe in another time sink to justify that power.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This on top of the just idiotic AP changes are making 7.2 one of the first patches I'm more disappointed in than excited for.<br />
<br />
yea...it seems like they're spewing the same idiotic crap they did last time this was brought up and pretty much every time it's brought up. <br />

&quot;The legendary items that are most problematic are the ones that feel like they are universally the best.&quot; <br />

^ Is probably the dumbest shit I've heard since wotlk when they said they didn't expect player power to get so high by the end....you create this shit...and supposedly have a better simming software than SimC....and you didn't figure this out?<br />
<br />
This on top of their smug responses to AP, makes it seem like they have literally no idea what their player base wants...And yes...it's their game they can do what they want....however it's not smart business when you're literally pissing everyone off from the top to bottom of your game with idiotic ideas/systems put in place. Take out the legendary system and AP system and this is an amazing expansion...put them in, and it's a very mediocre expansion(this is my personal opinion).</div></div><hr />

Well the original goal behind M+ was to be an ALTERNATIVE way to get gear for people who can't commit to raiding....the problem is it was a system that was poorly introduced.

Hey look, I'm gonna do the long and horrible chain quests twelve times ! -_-<br />

I haven't seen a single artifact skin that's worth that grind anyway, not even once. Not even if it was doable in LFR. In most cases I prefer the master skin that you get through the class quests.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RuneDK</div><div class="date">2017-02-23, 10:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is just my opinion, i repeat! MY OPINION.<br />
<br />
I always liked playing alts. playing alts was always fun, because i was able to help friends with different alts such as a tank or a healer.<br />
with legion i started again as enhancement shaman, i felt pretty good. rotation was good and smooth. it was just a bit awkward to see people dealing 5k more dps than i did with 10 less ilvl or more even.<br />
now... we have dps rng on top of its peak. an enhancement shaman from another guide, same gear as i have, pulled 200k dps more than i did on trillax. he had over a 30 sec less fight time 28 additional proccs compared to me... i had 26... and that is just a joke tbh!<br />
<br />
the ap grind stops me from playing an alt, rerolling to another dps character.<br />
in my opinion i am atm not sure if im either playing a gambling game or a mmorpg.<br />
<br />
i didnt mention the legendarys... but that is obvious.<br />
<br />
Enhancement is unfortunately a very RNG dependent spec that wont change without core things in the class changing. I think we(im enhance too) have the highest dps range on simcraft of all specs. I sim over 600k, with a range over 150k....so I could play perfectly and do crap dps....</div></div><hr />

They said they would be reducing how much AP you get from end-of-run chests, so yes, you'll get a varying amount of AP based on the dungeon you completed, with longer ones giving more, but overall the gain per dungeon is being reduced, and a chunk of AP is being shifted to the weekly box, which will be based on the highest level completed.<br />

Yes, they do admit it, but only after the expansion is done. Ion will admit they had problems wit legendaries and they didnt quite work out - after Legion is done. <br />

100% agree. I am switching between Holy and Ret for my guild's progression runs, and I'm basically forced to throw all of my AP into the Ret tree to stay competitive. If I ever have to substitute-heal, I'm about 5-10% weaker than the other healers, even though our item levels are similar. This is pointless, all to avoid an &quot;odd feeling&quot; of having your offspec artifact fully powered? Cmon Blizz, this is the WORST part of the AP grind.

You dont understand.

I was helping out the good spirits in Azsuna and was about to inspect my reward from their quartermaster then out of nothing i found this ring inside! It was strange and never explained how it got inside that box, but what a cool story and fantasy of getting one of the most powerful items in the World of Warcraft. I would really feel bad after knowing the origin of this item that it still can enhance death knights specialized in frost as well.

If there is a limit it will be reached by the vast majority a day or two after reset tops.

Or maybe like One high AP reward per lvl +2, 3, 4 etc. That way people aren't just running 6-9 all day. Higher rewards means going farther.<br />
<br />
Edit: nope nevermind listening to it again it does sound like just one big reward from weekly chest. But you can still make AP gains just not as much as before.<br />
<br />
Just as long as they make sure that the best way to progress your weapon is by doing boring, piss easy world quests. Why should challenging dungeons offer more reward than tagging 6 harpies and watching other people kill them?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I disagree with that statement. What feels odd is investing a ton of AP into an artifact then having the rug pulled out from under you when the rotation is redesigned several months after release to something you don't like (e.g. Marksman changes). Then starting completely over after switching to a new spec and feeling weak in comparison.</div></div><hr />

I also think they're going about &quot;improving&quot; the legendary system in the completely wrong way. First off, balance the legendaries you have out now instead of continuing to add new ones. The term &quot;middle of the road&quot; legendary is so backwards. It's legendary, it's supposed to be the best. How are you going to say there's a problem with there being bad legendaries and then go and say you're making new legendaries that won't be the best. Where's the logic in that?</div></div><hr />

If you think, other than the flat damage boost, that your weapon is that much weaker it may as well be trash it is BECAUSE you picked up all the utility talents.<br />
<br />
Not everyone can go thro &quot;dps talents&quot;. Not everyone can put time for all 3 weapons (specially when I personally want to focus on Affli rather than Demo for example).<br />
Plus if you are mythic raider, good luck trying to justify going to weapon with no 10% dmg boost for example.<br />
<br />
It just removes the flexibility. The gear already has possibility for it with STR/Intel/Agi stats all in one item. In theory you could be druid with just one set (ok ok sub-optimal stats but still) but your weapon would suck on all other specs than the one you focused on.</div></div><hr />

First they talk about how majority of players don't do that, don't do this (artifact power etc), then after, they hide behind the tiniest minority, of why the legendary name and lore prevents them from making it work across specs.

Its not just players.<br />
<br />
Its guilds as well. Im at 50 odd and every week its a &quot;Hey everyone get your 54 traits&quot;. Its become an arbitrary goal and Blizzard continues to implement these goals without realised that players will burn themselves out on them.<br />
<br />
People can blame the playerbase all they like, but end of the day, Blizzard's aim is to retain players by having a long lasting game. In the 12 years of WoW, have players EVER paced this sort of thing and said &quot;Oh you know, its not important, ill get it sooner or later&quot;.<br />
<br />
No. Never. Never will.<br />
<br />
Its a very poor design choice, we voiced our concerns in beta - along with other concerns of the system (see classes like Death Knights and how theyre specs have just done a 180).<br />

This way there would be no need to pursuit AP but feel like &quot;more AP? meh, why not..&quot;.<br />
<br />
About guilds spending so much time playing - it's their own life, they can decide what to do with their free time, but I think there should be some limit. It would be interesting to gate the raids not with attempts, but with time spent there. What would happen if Blizzard said &quot;you have (let's say) 12 hours (per difficulty?) per weekly raid lock, divide them as you wish&quot;? Now that would be an interesting race. And we all would have some time to do some other things (both in-game and IRL). But Mythic+ dungeons would need some restriction too to prevent pushing them for better gear to have greater chance to kill bosses during the limited time in raids.</div></div><hr />

No longer can you spend the weekend hammering out mythic + with friends to get ap, now you're better off running one high m+ and then what, logging out until raid?<br />
<br />
from the beginning the point of M+ was &quot;let's give players something they can do as much as they want (kinda) with varying difficulty so they can shoot for the best they can do and try to improve each week!&quot; <br />
The community found the repeatability of M+ to be the path of less resistance to high AP. <br />
Now the devs want you to shoot for the completion of a difficult dungeon, not to grind for high amounts of AP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
What about Priaz &amp; Sephuz? If my warrior prot got both of them, when patch 7.2 will hit, will they be considered &quot;all specs got 2 legendaries each&quot;, &quot;no spec got a legendary&quot;, or &quot;tank spec got 2 legendaries&quot;? And what about cross spec legendaries, like the Execute ring (For both Arms and Fury, but not for Prot as prot doesn't have execute)?<br />
<br />
You're basically super-fucked if Prydaz and Sephuz are your first two legendaries.<br />
<br />
<br />
And seriously: Fuck them for thinking that an endless grind is what the AP system needed. AP being locked to each spec, and each character, is precisely why it should have an end-point. Those of us who play at least two specs are already getting screwed, anyone who plays multiple characters is getting screwed over even harder. <br />
<br />
Making the end-goal completely impossible is just going to make people give up. It is better to have an end-point, than setting the goal to be so impossible that all your effort feels completely worthless.<br />
<br />
I think they need to hire a behavioral expert to help them design their reward structures. This is the second expansion in a row where they understand that there is a problem, then proceed to exacerbate the problem instead of actually fixing it.</div></div><hr />

lmao dude your example is the extreme fringe case. lore is cool and all but I don't PLAY something to learn about it. books, etc are a much better medium, they don't impede on the actual functionality of the game and fucking ruin it like legendaries do. I could care less about some dumb ring with some random person's name I've never heard of on it, and the vast majority of players aren't knowing to know or care about whoever the hell that is. none of them have a questline, and instead of random boars, it's random chests. most people don't give a fuck how they function based on spec lore-wise, would rather have an enjoyable experience rather than be like &quot;oh that's cool, now I have to suffer with this shit functionality after that small tidbit of mildly-interesting info&quot;. but you're probably a troll because none of that makes sense, and so much of it is just blatantly wrong</div></div><hr />

Never blame RNG on people. Never.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
Guess Blizzard will never get the fact that even WoW being a MMO, and inherently MMOs being endless, even MMOs must have some end points.<br />
<br />
When they keep adding stuff to things that should be over by now (like reps), it really feels bad as you start to see that you'll never finish something in the game even months/years later.<br />
<br />
The same goes for their AP problem (and all the grind in Legion), they don't get it that if there is nothing like a weekly cap for AP, things like that will happen and will burn out the players. Like someone said once, since they keep balancing raids bosses with the extra dmg from 35+ Artifact Traits, BiS Legendaries, Titanforged, etc... in mind, more and more people will feel like going for it. As long as there are tight dps checks that calls for the maximum power you can possible get on a character, this will happen.<br />
<br />
And this happening, things goes bad for everything else in the game since people will start focusing on what gives them the most for less time and stop doing other things in the game (that they would be doing to have fun) like joining queues for pvp, events or whatever.<br />
<br />
If the AP farm had a weekly cap that you could reasonable reach, things would be way lighter now (and Blizzard would be well aware where the world is in their artifact level and work their encounter balance better). And then if you feel like that you want to farm more, switch specs and start getting it on another artifact. Even people playing on alts wouldn't feel bad that all that AP should be going for their main character/artifact instead.</div></div><hr />

In the 12 years of WoW, have players EVER paced this sort of thing and said &quot;Oh you know, its not important, ill get it sooner or later&quot;.<br />
<br />
No. Never. Never will.<br />
<br />
Yes. Yes they have. Blizzard has the actual data to back up their statements. They can see everything the players are doing and look at trends and where players are putting the most time and effort. It's also just common sense. The majority of players are not endlessly grinding for 54. I certainly am not. But I'm also not a Mythic raider. I'm not even a Heroic raider at the moment. Even if I was if my guild demanded me to run 50 M+ every week I'd refuse and find someone else to play with.<br />
<br />
That isn't to say the AP system isn't a flawed one because it very much is but players should hold themselves accountable for their actions and raiding &quot;standards&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The winging and moaning about grind in this thread is unbelievable. I'd say about 80% of you don't even know what proper grind is. Try grinding AAXP in Everquest, or farming Hecks in Elysium in pre AI Anarchy online, or even the legendary quest chain in LOTRO. Only when you try these will you be happy with your themepark WoW :)</div></div><hr />

If what he says about AP working for the &quot;vast majority of players&quot; is correct, changing it after six months of having it the way it is has a pretty freaking big chance of backfiring. I like the way AP works now. I don't really feel the need to grind it like others so, but sometimes I might for a little bit. It seems like some of 7.2's changes are for the 0.5 percent playerbase and to push people into raiding more. Can't really judge until it arrives.<br />

c'mon, this is not hard to work around this<br />
Just change its name and whole tooltip/stats in the same time. Legendaries are locking us into specs</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Diggsworth</div><div class="date">2017-02-24, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">from the beginning the point of M+ was &quot;let's give players something they can do as much as they want (kinda) with varying difficulty so they can shoot for the best they can do and try to improve each week!&quot; <br />
The community found the repeatability of M+ to be the path of less resistance to high AP. <br />
Now the devs want you to shoot for the completion of a difficult dungeon, not to grind for high amounts of AP.<br />
<br />
Which is what you do now, only after completing your +15/+17, instead of doing more, and getting rewards you're faced with two choices:<br />
1) Grind up a low level keystone and receive very little as a reward until you get to another high level stone<br />
2) Stop<br />
And then this doesn't even consider people who aren't able to get their own groups due to whatever.<br />
The subset of of players who currently complete m+ by having people carry them through their stone are going to be now put in a position where the groups who would normally carry them are unwilling to.<br />
Hell, once my groups completed our 15+ for the week, we usually carry players through stones, and it isn't even a waste of time since we still receive a chunk of AP, but after the changes, why bother?<br />
What's the point of grouping to level a +1-8 stone if you can't even be assured that you'll be in a good group to do the stone when it gets to a highe rlevel?<br />
Who's to say that you don't form the group, get through to +whatever, and then realize the stoneholder is a hyper carry?<br />
What does this new system mean for new players? Alts?<br />
Again, we can't know for usre until final adjustments are made, but currently the future doesn't look so hot.<br />
I'm willing to hope it gets better though/</div></div><hr />

It was only a fucking problem for those guilds whos leaders actually required their members to farm like that. THROW THEM UNDER THE BUS and do so without hesitation. Please tell me why i as a responsible grown ass adult can make the responsible grown ass choice to not play the game or aspects of the game i dont like. Hey ion hazzikostas i dont like mythic raiding i dont whine about how forced i am because it awards the best gear. Maybe i should or is that equally as unrealistic.<br />
<br />
Stop designing around the unhealthy and unrealistic expectations of a handful of try hards. THROW THEM UNDER THE BUS. Did you learn nothing from wod? Who are you designing this game for?<br />
<br />
for no lifers, unemployed ....mostly<br />
there is no way u can maintain a job or have a social life with teh amount of farming Legion brought upon players, one of teh reasons i quit was because i couldnt play other games for 2-3 days , thinking &quot;geez, i lost a lot of ap this weekend playing Planetside 2....&quot;<br />
So, i quit playing wow, third week now<br />
And it does kinda feel good, i play other games, have more time for other stuff also</div></div><hr />

Yep. To be clear you dont need 54 out of 54. This requirement is largely self imposed by guilds on the bleeding edge. My guild starts mythics this week ive got 40 points. Notnworried a single bit. It will come in time.</div></div><hr />

You are absolutly rght.<br />
I play this game since day 1 but it never felt so unbalanced ever before.<br />
Not only that char balance is an utter joke, no that ap grind makes it nearly impossible to play more then one alt.<br />
Who cares if we have a paragon system for the weapons and all have the same level when switching that would be one way regardless of if it felt &quot;right&quot;.<br />
And then the f...ing legendary system i am one that got f... by the system only having utility leg. Say bb dps as a fire mage that is completly broken in single target anyway.<br />
Its sad i love this game but i guess it would be the best to quit at this point cause its out of control with all the rng grind and imbalance there is.</div></div><hr />

This game is about gear in PVE. But people can not set their goal: &quot;I will have the best gear on the realm!&quot; because it is almost impossible. War/Titan crap ruins the game at the top.
