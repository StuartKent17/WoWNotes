Yes, yes it is.. only due to it being 925 version, it's bis... else it's WORTHLESS! /sarcasm off<br />

Wtf does an ilev have to do with ANYTHING regarding CoF? It's not the ilev that makes CoF BIS, it's the equip effect... Stating the ilev like that just makes you look completely clueless with zero idea why the trinket is good in the first place!</div></div><hr />

That's actually not true.<br />

At a certain point, class/spec depending, other trinkets can become better.<br />

Even if you don't equip CoF for the ilvl or the primary stat in the first place,it'll make ilvl matter even more on CoF as the main stat received a significant boost</div></div><hr />

Irony.<br />
<br />
You are trying to sound smart - but end up looking the opposite. The iLvL is indeed important re/ CoF since other trinkets can still be better depending what iLvL your CoF is, and depending what other trinket you are comparing it to. There is this wonderful thing called Simcraft that may help you to understand the interplay between various trinkets and gear. Check it out.</div></div><hr />

Dood I will still be using my 875 convergence on my fury warrior.... I dont know why warriors seem to have problems with all these OP trinkets from Nighthold. Its almost like the class/spec doesnt give a shit about strength, just crap tons of secondary stats and cheesy trinkets.</div></div><hr />

You are not so clever so I'll explain... the whole point of my reply was to show that WHO THE FUCK CARES about ilev.. yeeeeeeeeeea at some point u will pass the % to do more dps with something else than CoF but the WHOLE issue with CoF is the equip effect and that's what all fuzz is about... apparently you missed it so grats on your newfound knowledge!</div></div><hr />

Lol, you trying to retcon your own quoted text? <br />
<br />
You trashed the poster for including their iLvL, which is totally relevant to the question they asked. Now you are pretending that your very obviously worded post meant something different? Best to just back away from this conversation now. Anyone wanting to can just scroll up and see exactly what you said. So even if you 'meant' it to come across differently, it didn't. and you were dripping salt all over that other poster just to be a dick. So don't get all pissy now when I call you out on it.</div></div><hr />

It does. The 905 I had ended up being surpassed by other trinkets at higher item level due to the stat loss. You seriously think an 865 CoF is as good as a 955 one? You think they're even close? Cuz they are definitely not.</div></div><hr />

Did I compare to a 865? ....No... a HC CoF is for free now so let's just assume that's the shittiest ppl will use... no need to pull a completely retarded low ilev out of your ass!<br />
<br />
Also YOU might have it like that.. I can assure you that nothing from ToS in beating a 905 CoF for me!<br />
<br />
Also the reason for my reply is that the OP is just &quot;omg look at my ilev&quot;-posting, which I hate more than the forum warriors...</div></div><hr />

First off, WoD doesn’t feature the 77 day rule so any mention of it is just wrong. Also it doesn’t have to be 7.3.5; the raid patch could very well be 7.3.2, it’s just a number.</div></div><hr />

Because they said there will be one multiple times, and that 7.3.2 is just an extra, non-content patch preparing some background things. 7.3.5 will be the raid release, or sometime thereabouts, 100%.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There won't be a 7.3.5 patch for Antorus due to blizzcon, 7.3.2 is also said to not be a 7.3.5 patch and will not stick to the regular schedule, and them posting the patch notes yesterday and hitting RC a few days before, hints that this patch is landing next reset, and they'll probably confirm it on Monday.<br />
<br />
As for ToS, it's nearing it's 5 month duration (June 20th/21st -&gt; November 20th/21st) which is Blizzard's preferred length of a singular instance tier, however since that date is right before thanksgiving, it probably means they'll skip that reset and launch on the 28th/29th of November instead.<br />
<br />
7.3.5 or whatever it is, will come after Antorus launch, and depending on how long the tier will last, it could be another ToV story wrap up related to the progression of the titan story after Sargeras got jailed, or maybe even a lead in for the next expansion where we for example we prevent the resurrection of C'thun.</div></div><hr />

Patch on September? Nice time travel there.<br />
<br />
Also why jump from the week after Blizzcon to 28-29?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The exact verbiage is &quot;this raid won’t be available with the release of patch 7.3.2, and will open at a later date.&quot; Emphasis on 'date' not 'patch'. Maybe you are right and it will open with a later patch, but the flip side is maybe you're wrong and it's exactly as they said, just a later date and not on patch day. It's not like it would be the first time they released a patch and a raid didn't unlock till later without the need of an additional patch.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doffen</div><div class="date">2017-10-24, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah the raid is &quot;ready&quot;, patched and all with 7.3, they dont need to add another patch. They simply just have to open it through a server restart. If even that.<br />
<br />
If any 7.3.5 it will be about the aftermath of Antorus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seems you do not have much experience with CoF usage. <br />
A difference of 1 sec on cd reduction can mean you having to wait 10-15 secs more on a cd to come back up and if your boss encounter timings are out of sync, then even longer. This nerf essentially makes it much less desirable for most classes that use it. I know ill swap it out on my UH dk. But then again Spectre of Betrayal is meh so I guess ill be rooting for the CoEN on use haste trinket even more now. Using 940 chrono + 895 CoF because they sim highest for me just sucks.</div></div><hr />

As many have already said, NO, next week is Blizzcon (3 and 4 November) they won't bother with a patch next week, most of the Blizzard staff will be preparing for Blizzcon all next week, and they want all the player's eyes on Blizzcon, not on a new raid, they could do it the week after but...it's pretty short after Blizzcon I'd sooner expect like November 14th or 21st</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">precious</div><div class="date">2017-10-24, 07:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They said clearly new raid will come when max ak will be available, so ppl can catch up any newly toons or alts.

<br />
Also there is no way in hell open new raid with 300 kills in tomb so far. They want way more so they will give more time, or nerf even further.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, they said that Antorus will come out when enough people have completed Mythic ToS (Similar to how ToS was, with Nighthold). <br />
<br />
Antorus will come out either next Week (Though, highly unlikely), or on November 14th (AKA, 77 days. Which is most likely to occur).<br />
<br />
So, i'd say it comes out at AROUND AK 51.</div></div><hr />

When did they say this? I agree with you it will probably be nov 14th, aka 77 days, but I have never seen a blue post saying anything about the release date being relative to how many people have completed ToS. Source please?</div></div><hr />

With 300 guilds with kills, 550 on trying to kill and 1200 guilds on avatar and close to start on kj aka close to 1800 guilds on track in the next 3-4 weeks, no not even close enough guilds cleared tomb. At this point i dont even think november will happen.</div></div><hr />

There are no Blueposts, but there are millions of Q@A's discussing it.<br />
<br />
Look them up. They're saying that they want a good enough time span between Raids, so that people could complete current content in a matter of time. :)</div></div><hr />

If you don't think Antorus is going to happen in the next 2-3 weeks, then you don't know how Blizzard is doing Legion, my friend.</div></div><hr />

They want ppl to buzz with the new exp info. Not dealing with new raids and world first races.<br />
<br />
And if antorus comes out in 2-3 weeks then what? Is it the last raid of the exp right? So we gonna have 13-15 months raid since they said clearly that legion gonna last more than wod?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I doubt they will delay the raid's release for the sake of those guilds who will still be progressing on Avatar/KJ in a few weeks, if Antorus is indeed scheduled for release in November already.</div></div><hr />

Yes, that's exactly what they're going to do. Antorus will release in November, and that'll be the only thing to raid for the next 12 months</div></div><hr />

Intelligence doesn't make being an asshole acceptable. You haven't shared any significant information or insight that warrants your toxicity. Simulations and valuing trinkets isn't rocket science. Those who can't be bothered to do it themselves, or who don't have the time, are not idiots for asking those who do take the time to sim, to perhaps share their knowledge so that they can learn whats better too, and have improved results in game as well. <br />
<br />
Since when is someone actively asking questions in order to improve their game viewed as anything but a good thing? I think anyone asking questions, even stupid ones, are both a great sign of someone who desires to be better. The way you are carrying on in this thread is infantile, and as such you are not by any means making anyone feel inferior to you. You can suggest that you are immune to criticism, and that you don't care what anyone else thinks, but your continued actions say something entirely different.<br />
<br />
If anyone ever feels discouraged from asking questions because of these kinds of douche bags, just try and remember that they aren't fooling anyone with the diarrhea that comes out of their mouths. You should never feel too old, too much, or not enough of anything to stop learning. Any efforts of improvement are worthy endeavors!</div></div><hr />
