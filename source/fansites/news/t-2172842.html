Weekly Bonus Event - Arena Skirmishes<br />
Sharpen your swords and reinforce your boards, because you’re called to the PvP Arena for the hectic mayhem of Skirmishes.<br />
<br />
This Week: Arena Skirmishes<br />
All week, from anywhere in Azeroth, open the Group Finder (default hotkey: i), select the Player vs. Player tab on the bottom of the window, and then under Arena Battles, choose either 2v2 or 3v3 and JOIN BATTLE. You’ll be matched up with teammates and provided with opponents to kill in the Arena.<br />
<br />
Look for the following all week long:<br />
<br />
<br />
Archmage Timear (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/111246-archmage-timear) near Violet Hold in Dalaran has a quest (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/44172-the-arena-calls) for you.<br />
<br />
Quest requirement: Win 10 Arena PvP Skirmishes<br />
Reward: A PvP loot box<br />
<br />
Passive buff: +50% honor gains from Skirmishes<br />
<br />
<br />
If you’ve been looking to make some Honor gains, this is the week to do it!<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 7.2 - Shake Up the Battlegrounds with PvP Brawls<br />
With the release of patch 7.2: The Tomb of Sargeras, you can experience some of your favorite player-vs-player Battlegrounds with a little extra twist.<br />
<br />
Every other week a new PvP Brawl will be available to players looking for something just a little different. Each Brawl will offer a variety of modes, rules, and scenic changes to the usual Battleground gameplay, and you’ll find them in the Group Finder tool (hotkey “I”) in the Player vs. Player tab. Just like Random Battlegrounds, you’ll receive a reward for achieving victory. Here are just a few of the Brawls you can look forward to:<br />
<br />
Gravity Lapse – Resource Race<br />
Gravity getting you down? Step into the Eye of the Storm and be prepared for a whole new en-lighten-ing experience. Every minute, players on the battlefield will find themselves launched into the air, only to gently fall toward the ground once more in a perpetual aerial ballet as they try to accrue enough resources to take the win home for their team.<br />
<br />

<br />
Tarren Mill vs. Southshore – Warfare<br />
Originally introduced as a part of the World of Warcraft 10-Year Anniversary event, this Brawl harkens to the early days of WoW PvP with an epic battle between the two towns of Tarren Mill and Southshore. In this game of war, you’ll need to work as a team to deplete your foes’ resources to claim victory.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Warsong Scramble – Capture the Flag<br />
Do you have a flag? Warsong Gulch has always been the scene of an epic Capture the Flag battle, but what happens when you can capture your enemy’s flag without your own at base? Find out when you step into this PvP Brawl! We’ve also added a few more power-ups to the field of battle to stir things up a bit. To win, your team will need to be the first to capture 5 flags.<br />
<br />

<br />
As with Micro-Holidays, these PvP Brawls are just the beginning. We look forward to seeing which ones become your favorites!<br />

Patch 7.2 Healer PvP Changes<br />

FEEDBACK: Transmog Sets<br />
Further misbehavior in this thread will not result in action against anybody's account, it will simply result in me not posting on the forums. While I would like to have as open of a discussion about things as possible with the community and keep you in the loop where applicable when we fix bugs that might not make the patch notes, it is hard for me to take that idea seriously when any specific topic that I try to discuss is constantly derailed. There are many things to talk about in the game at any given time. This is a thread for transmog sets. <br />
<br />
If you guys genuinely want communication with developers, spamming up a completely unrelated thread with your personal crusade issue is the wrong way to go about it. (Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20753117992?page=4#64))<br />

Mask of Artful Dodging<br />
Mask of Artful Dodging (http://www.wowdb.com/items/130322-mask-of-artful-dodging)<br />
We reviewed the intended drop locations of these items and they were not working as intended. They have been relocated and should be available in the current PTR build. (Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20753167747?page=1#2))<br />

So much for improving dev/player communications...<br />
<br />

Wrong. There was a bunch of Rogue players spamming the Transmog feedback thread about the stupid hood transmog; nearly every reply in the thread was about said transmog. <br />
<br />
What was worse is they kept doing it even after he asked them to knock it off the first time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
all 3 are recipes for disasters, Krosus = bye bye melee, Tich = disease spread alert and idiot tank check, Elisande = 1 shot orbs, but by all means, Elisande should be a cake walk in LFR.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And the direct result of said antics, is the blue post directly below the one chiding us for wanting an answer, revealing that said mask was not working as intended, and subsequently fixed.<br />
<br />
It's a shame players have to resort to such tactics to have a back and forth with blizzard, but you can't deny it's justification, or its effectiveness in getting the issue fixed.</div></div><hr />

I'd much rather they communicate with people who will actually discuss things instead of acting like children. Why waste time talking to people who clearly just want to win a shouting match?</div></div><hr />

The Warsong Scramble seems pretty stupid, though. Games will be decided around who has a DH or Monk flag carrier, and will be over in mere minutes.</div></div><hr />
