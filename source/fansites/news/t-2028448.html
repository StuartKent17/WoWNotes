<br />
The skies over Azeroth are growing darker. . . .<br />
<br />
The Legion pre-expansion patch is arriving July 19, and we wanted to give you a heads up about what to expect—and when you can expect it.<br />
<br />
This update will include a wide variety of features and content that set the stage for the expansion, including system changes, quality-of-life improvements, and major in-game events. Some of these features will be available immediately, while other content will be unlocked in the weeks leading up to the expansion’s launch. Read on for more details.<br />
<br />
The Opening Salvo<br />
<br />
When the pre-expansion patch initially goes live, players will be able to immediately access many of its key system-related features. Some of these major updates include:<br />
<br />
Transmogrification Updates<br />
The new Transmogrification Collections system will make it easier than ever to collect, store, and sort through the gear you want to use for transmogging—without taking up storage space in your inventory, bank, or Void Storage. As you collect items that can be used with the system, you can browse through them—as well as sort by class or slot—in the Appearances tab in your Collections interface.<br />
<br />
Class Updates<br />
We’re making some significant changes to classes and their specs for Legion to further strengthen their identities. The core changes to spells, talents, and more are going into effect as soon as the pre-expansion patch goes live. For more information on what’s new for each class and spec, read our earlier class preview blogs.<br />
<br />
We’re also making it easier to switch between specializations for different content. Players will be able to queue up for dungeons, raids, Battlegrounds, or Arenas as any role that is available to their class, while continuing to play as another role while they’re waiting. When they enter the content they’ve queued for, they will automatically switch to the suitable role upon entering (at no cost) and then switch back automatically when they leave the instance.<br />
<br />
The March Toward Legion<br />
<br />
In the weeks following the pre-expansion patch, we’ll be unlocking even more content that leads into the August 30 launch of Legion. We’re still determining the exact timing of these events, but players who pre-purchase Legion can expect to be playing a Demon Hunter around the second or third week of August (no later than August 17 globally). We’ll share more details in the weeks ahead, but here’s a look at what’s in store:<br />
<br />
Burning Legion Invasions<br />
Before all hellfire breaks loose upon the Broken Shore, the Burning Legion will begin its assault upon Azeroth, turning some familiar stomping grounds into demon-infested battlefields—and it will be up to the heroes of the Alliance and the Horde to face the onslaught.<br />
<br />
Demon Hunter Early Access<br />
In the weeks before launch, those who have pre-purchased Legion will get early access to the new Demon Hunter class. Players will begin at level 98 and will find themselves on the fel-shattered expanse of Mardum, where they’ll play the Demon Hunter starting experience before joining their allies in the fight against the Legion.<br />
<br />
The Battle on the Broken Shore Begins<br />
As the situation grows more dire, Azeroth’s heroes will begin their first foray onto the Broken Shore—the epicenter of the demonic invasion.<br />
<br />
All of the features and content listed above (save for Demon Hunter early access) will be available to all World of Warcraft players, regardless of whether they’ve pre-purchased Legion.</div></div><hr />

Word to the wise, make ABSOLUTELY SURE that an item's appearance has indeed been added to your wardrobe before selling/deleting it. This goes for anyone, since we don't know what issues may arise and I've seen cases on Beta where items were not added despite meeting requirements.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the PTR, all garrison and shipyard missions that were still running when I copied a character over were marked for failure, even the ones with 100% success rate. That's not such a big deal for the garrison missions but, for the shipyard missions, it exposes the ships to a second round of RNG where they can be destroyed. Personally, I'm not planning on starting any new missions on Monday just in case they do the same thing when the patch goes live.<br />
<br />
Also, from experience on the PTR, almost all of the gold missions are gone and the salvage yard changes are in effect. The contents of existing crates shouldn't be affected; however, the gold value of the gear and weapon upgrades from the crates are much lower.</div></div><hr />

Transmog is &quot;primary armour type only&quot;, so cloth items won't be moggable onto a Demon Hunter because DH primary armour type is leather, not cloth.</div></div><hr />

This is incorrect. They've repeatedly said crates are unchanged but missions will start dropping new crates<br />

Will HC Archimonde mount stay obtainable after pre-patch?<br />
<br />
According to their blog post, yes. It's removed when they turn on the expansion<br />

I've been playing on the PTR which essentially has the pre-patch content. The Cata raid gold nerfs are in place on there. On top of the Garrison gold missions being removed.</div></div><hr />

That's not such a big deal for the garrison missions but, for the shipyard missions, it exposes the ships to a second round of RNG where they can be destroyed. Personally, I'm not planning on starting any new missions on Monday just in case they do the same thing when the patch goes live.<br />
<br />
Also, from experience on the PTR, almost all of the gold missions are gone and the salvage yard changes are in effect. The contents of existing crates shouldn't be affected; however, the gold value of the gear and weapon upgrades from the crates are much lower.<br />
Ships do not get destroyed(atleast all my ones survuve)</div></div><hr />

It's available during the Demon Invasions only to Demon Hunters, but unless you pre-order, you cannot play a Demon Hunter during the invasions.

<br />
Why would it be close? We'll be looking at a 6 week pre-patch till Legion launch. That's a perfect time frame for them.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tumaras</div><div class="date">2016-07-16, 03:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizz has stated a few times that the patch is coming on the 19th (which is earlier than most pre-patches) to allow folks time to get used to the gui changes, class changes etc., and that the demon invasions, Broken Shore, etc. will start a bit later closer to Legion release (probably in 2-3 weeks). They could always do it sooner, but at least that's what they've said was the plan.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wingram</div><div class="date">2016-07-16, 03:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ships do not get destroyed(atleast all my ones survuve)<br />
I had two ships destroyed on a naval mission which originally had an 80% success rate. My point was, under normal circumstances, the mission would have had an 80% chance to succeed and only a 20% chance to subject the ships to the RNG that could destroy them. But, by marking the mission as failed, it went right to the RNG which happened to destroy them.<br />
<br />
For the mathematically inclined, let's say there's a 10% chance that one or more ships will be destroyed if the mission fails. Normally, when you start a mission with an 80% chance of success, the probability of losing a ship would be (1-.8) x .10 or 2%. But, by marking all of the missions as failures the probability of losing a ship is 10% or 5 times greater.<br />
<br />
So, not every ship will be destroyed, it's just more likely than it was for the missions you completed prior to the patch. It just seems safer to me to not start any missions on Monday. After that, it should be fine.<br />
<br />
Again, this is supposing that what they have been doing on the PTR will carry over to the patch when it goes live on Tuesday.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't mean like that...I mean...well this has been the slowest expansion that needs a lot of work...took forever to move out of Alpha. Maybe they were worried about the condition it would be in and weren't prepared till the last moment?<br />

<br />
The invasion event which includes the transmog gear for characters will be available for demon hunters to participate in. Not only is the event going to be happening later during the pre-patch time frame, but there are also demon hunter only weapons (warglaives) only obtainable through the invasion event.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's listed in Wowhead as being the only Warglaive that uses that model. It might not be that flashy, but it accounts for like one of the couple dozen appearance options for Warglaives, counting every Artifact variation, so I feel it's notable in that regard.</div></div><hr />

2 or 3 weeks for Blizzard to get EVERYTHING stable for actually Demon Invasions. Like the guy said on the Q&amp;A, they want to make sure everything is running smooth before starting the event.<br />

You may want to open those crates this weekend if you want to save some gold.<br />
<br />
While the saved crates will still have the same contents in after pre patch, after pre patch all the follower upgrades and class tmog sets that drop from them sell to vendors for coppers isntead of gold, might be worth opening them and mass mailing the boes to an alt to sit in mail storage till after patch</div></div><hr />

Everything should be stable at the launch of a patch, if it's not stable, why launch it? There's little excuse to wait three weeks to release content and their excuse is equally stupid, it won't take three weeks for people to get used to heavily pruned classes, most people will hate the changes as well without realising the artefact ties in heavily to the classes, the classes are little more than previews at this point whilst you wait for the real deal which will come august 30th.<br />
<br />
Transmogrifying isn't content, nor is staring at the salvage yard while you open thousands of crates, Blizzard have been releasing all this crap over hyping the patch people are going to be very disappointed come launch day when it turns out they can't read and they're left wondering why they have little to nothing for three weeks.<br />
<br />
You shouldn't have to wait three weeks after a patch to get content when the game hasn't had any new content in over a year, people want content, gating it all is the wrong approach, at the very least invasions should be available the following week after the patch with demon hunters and the broken shore coming later.</div></div><hr />

It says on the post &quot;We’re still determining the exact timing of these events, but players who pre-purchase Legion can expect to be playing a Demon Hunter around the second or third week of August (no later than August 17 globally).&quot;</div></div><hr />

I.e<br />
6.2.4 = 10G<br />
7.0.1 = 2G<br />

??<br />
<br />
More like<br />
<br />
6.2.4 = 10g<br />
7.0.1 = 10c<br />
<br />
<br />
This is incorrect. They've repeatedly said crates are unchanged but missions will start dropping new crates<br />
<br />
Content wise no, the crates haven't changed, but in sell value they have. The follower items will be worth significantly less as have been shown on the PTR.<br />
<br />
<br />
This was my misunderstanding then. I thought crates were being turned to trash and that new crates were coming from missions.<br />
<br />
No they will stay, but the sell value of the follower items will be reduced by a big chunk, see my above quote.</div></div><hr />

No, you do the artifact quest lines AFTER Broken Shore, but there will be a time gap after BS for us o &quot;lick our wounds&quot;. When legion launches I think the quest to summon you to Dal will appear, that kicks off legion.</div></div><hr />

My point was, under normal circumstances, the mission would have had an 80% chance to succeed and only a 20% chance to subject the ships to the RNG that could destroy them. But, by marking the mission as failed, it went right to the RNG which happened to destroy them.<br />
<br />
For the mathematically inclined, let's say there's a 10% chance that one or more ships will be destroyed if the mission fails. Normally, when you start a mission with an 80% chance of success, the probability of losing a ship would be (1-.8) x .10 or 2%. But, by marking all of the missions as failures the probability of losing a ship is 10% or 5 times greater.<br />
<br />
So, not every ship will be destroyed, it's just more likely than it was for the missions you completed prior to the patch. It just seems safer to me to not start any missions on Monday. After that, it should be fine.<br />
<br />
Again, this is supposing that what they have been doing on the PTR will carry over to the patch when it goes live on Tuesday.<br />
Well you made a mistake to send not protected ships on 80% missions.Over 90% missions ships cannot be destroyed.My ones was 90+ and all ships stay alive even that mission failed and some of them just got that protected message and do not sink</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hard enough to not make it worth it when the overwhelming # of customers will not purchase that edition, let alone from amazon. I have every CE. It is a trade off that i knowingly and willingly make in order to get the extra items that are in it like the behind the scenes dvd and art book and such. Spend the 2 weeks that you won't be playing the DH looking through your past CE' art books. There's some great work in there.</div></div><hr />

Stupid by Blizzard. Not all of us have completed Mythic yet.<br />
<br />
...do you honestly expect them to wait to release Legion until everyone's finished Mythic HFC?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well there are a lot of players who did not milk their garrisons that left WoD and their best time to make their gold from the tokens is the first 2-3 weeks of this patch, so I am predicting the 26th is when you will see the huge drop in token value until it bottoms out and people wait for it to rise again before buying gold.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The question is though, were they? Since all the stuff lots of people hated in wod is coming to legion as well. Lookie here:<br />
<br />
1. Mandatory facebook gaming garrison table - check<br />
2. Ability pruning - check<br />
3. Forced no flying until god knows when - check<br />
4. Overabundance of RNG in gearing - check<br />
5. Too much difficulties for the sake of having difficulties - check<br />
6. 20-man mythic is still a thing - check<br />
7. Don't even get me started on pvp...<br />
<br />
So I won't be so quick to say that Blizz learned.</div></div><hr />

Not a stupid question, the Blue Post is deliberately ambiguous. Nonetheless the post alludes to the Demon Hunter early access starting &quot;In the weeks before launch&quot; -launch being 30th August... so who knows, hopefully we'll have early access by early August!</div></div><hr />

1. its less then in wod and some people actually like it. so its fine<br />
2. useless abilitys gone - thats a good thing.<br />
3. once you get the whistle you wont even miss flying its great.<br />
4. its easier to get higher item lvl - thats good. i dont see the problem with it?<br />
5. you arent forced to do them all, people arent equally skilled at this game so it helps that more people can do the content<br />
6. 20 man mythic was the best thing of wod, so its good that it stays.</div></div><hr />

Nah I just like calling out people that can't be bothered to read the OP before posting. The OP was pretty clear, maybe your reading comprehension was lacking? Nowhere did I get the impression that DH launced with the patch.</div></div><hr />

yes sir, i have to agree to some points. but not all and not full to everyone. my breakdown would be:<br />
<br />
1) i have no problem with, since its really a small side part and dont feel like garry. not great, not bad. its ok.<br />
2) the pruning is not that hard this time. a lot of talents are active. i tested all classes. everyone had a full bar.<br />
3) thats right. but half the people love it, other half hate it. not an easy point to agree/disagree.<br />
4) totally agree.<br />
5) cant decide if i hate or like. it has upsides and downsides. difficult to just agree to me, but its a valid point.<br />
6) dont understand here. but i like 20m myth (and no 10s). so i think i disagree here.<br />
7) i fear you are right there. but to me, after 10 years of waiting, talent split is a HUGE step in the right direction.</div></div><hr />

Right, because WOTLK launch was so smooth I had to open 2 tickets just during the first evening of playing. -_-<br />

They have 1.5 months to fix that, though.</div></div><hr />

Do you have a point, or just a false equivalence?<br />
<br />
Considering that artifacts are pretty much THE major feature of Legion, &quot;oh they'll fix it in the last month before launch&quot; is beyond ridiculous. I miss the old Blizzard style of &quot;It's released when it's ready.&quot; No they weren't perfect before, but after the corporate shift mid-Wrath, they stopped even pretending to care and started a long string of poorly timed patch and expansion releases. Or did you miss how ICC, DS, SoO, and HFC all went on for a year? Did you miss raids being rendered irrelevant before even the World 200s finished them (hello Highmaul, they even admitted they screwed this one)?<br />
<br />
I'd rather them get it right for once, because overall Legion looks good and deserves better than being half-baked.</div></div><hr />

You should take a look at other MMOs then. The number of bugs is generally much higher and that's in live releases. The bugs in beta can definitely be ironed out in a month and a half. It's not like they forgot to model several artefacts, it's just some quests that are not working.<br />

I agree about Highmaul (who doesn't?). As for 1 year content drought, I think they stem precisely from Blizzard's perfectionism and (after GC's leave) by the desire to overhaul everything every expansion.<br />
