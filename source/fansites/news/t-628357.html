News have been slow lately, Blizzard posters are taking a break for the end of the year and I don't have much to write about. Hopefully there are still a bunch of interesting things to post and Tier 8 sets and Ulduar gear were at the top of my list. <br />
<br />
Please note that these models aren't really new, most of them have been sitting here since the beta of Wrath of the Lich King. I just didn't have the time to news them before (because it actually takes some work to get everything nice and organized), that's pretty much the same with Ulduar weapons, I probably already posted some of them in the past actually but this time you've got the extra-nice high resolution screenshots. <br />
<br />
These items will be released with Patch 3.1, it means that everything below is still in beta phase and could be changed (Reminder: This is not the next patch, the next one is 3.0.8 and will most likely be deployed on live servers in the first weeks of January). Don't jump to conclusions because something doesn't look as nice as you wanted it to be, it could even be an error from my side in some case. (Wrong glows on armors or weapons, I don't think it really happened here but you can never be sure) <br />
<br />
Druids / Paladins / Shamans / Warrior sets are not in the game files for the moment, it also seems that there isn't any texture for the male version of the rogue set. Just wait a few more weeks and we'll probably see everything on 3.1 PTRs. <br />
<br />
Thanks to Zorkk for the help on coding a few things. See you all in 2009!<br />

Ulduar Weapons<br />
Again, these files have been here for some time and we will most likely see more models added to the game with the release of the Ulduar raid dungeon. <br />
<br />
Note: The model of the 2-Hand mace is actually named &quot;Aspects&quot; instead of Ulduar, but one of the skin used on this mace is properly named &quot;Ulduar&quot; and we will most likely see this mace for the first time in 3.1.<br />

Rogues are stuck with fists + daggers currently.<br />
<br />
The rogue set on a troll is probably going to look retarded beyond measure... Good thing we can hide helmets indeed.<br />
<br />
<br />
The colors are for 10/25 man, and probably 2-3 sets for the different PvP tiers as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
- 10/25 Man versions<br />
- Recolors for non-set items<br />
- Recolors for items included much later in game<br />
- Recolors for gear used on NPCs/Monsters (the Mage Tier 8 is used on Rhonin / Aethas Sunreaver / etc ... Warlock one on Grand Apothecary Putress)<br />
- Recolors just in case they need them. ^^</div></div><hr />

<br />
My opinion on the sets:<br />
<br />
DK: mix of starter set and t5 warr helmet, blue one looks nice!<br />
hunter: always get nice sets, like the t0-alike things on the bottom of the shoulders<br />
mage: ugly, robot alike<br />
priest: LOVE IT, really awesome looking, really like the gold and blue ones!<br />
rogue: strange, doesnt really fit, i think the headpiece isnt roguelike, although the rest of the suit is stealthy, hope they have a button to turn of the shoulder-lights when they stealth:)<br />
lock: love the looks, dont like the colours!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomestomper</div><div class="date">2008-12-31, 10:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Doubt it will be used for Arena set, most likely 10/25man + offset drops in Ulduar. Extra color might be for Bosses / NPC's inside the instance aswell.<br />
<br />
They said something about the PvP gear to look like it's more made by your faction or something like that, making it different from the PvE sets. Hopefully they will go through with that!</div></div><hr />

Yeah, it's pants, not a robe. And it's a pretty refreshing set, I'm a little jealous (being a priest). I know there'll be outcries about how casters should wear robes and that mages look dumb in a chestplate and helm setup, but damn, it's a battle mage.<br />

As a shaman i cant wait to se the new armor for them. Think they did a good job on the T7...atleast the 25-set...didnt like the blue colors.<br />

T1 we had boobs on our shoulders, wheee<br />
T2 bloodfang, looked good. at least, the &quot;revised&quot; bloodfang did<br />
T3 is the T7 we have today, it was pretty ok, though too gray.<br />
T4 pink purple and black. the colors could have been redone, but it wasn't too bad overall<br />
T5 was a laugh certainly. pink eyed skeletor.. it was rather nasty.<br />
T6 wasn't too bad.<br />
T7 same as T3 but different colors, not too impressed by it<br />
T8 the shoulders are awesome (special effect), the helmet is dreadfully disgusting though</div></div><hr />

Sad that there is no trace of paladin set yet. I am dying to see it, since it is t8. The even tier number sets for paladins are always looking great, while odd sets look like crap.

Mages look stupid (maybe not so much if you turn off the helm).<br />

<br />
<br />
Didn't see that post, it's that easy. I'd also like to point out that we're not on Blizzard's &quot;good side&quot;, MMO-Champion never joined the official fansite program (pretty sure we're the only big fansite out there not in their program) but we never had any problem with them either, the few mail contacts I had with them were really nice.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The mage set seems wrong, it should be pants judging from the mages in the Violet Citadel. ???<br />
<br />
<br />
I might news the &quot;pants&quot; version a bit later, the reason I used a robe is because that's what the game use for the only version of Mage T8 coded in game that might be potentially dedicated to players. (= With an inventory icon) I won't go into the technical details because nobody care about it but it seemed to be the best choice. <br />
<br />
The name on the texture clearly indicates that they're pants, not a robe, but it's used as a robe in the version mentioned earlier ... I'd rather be conservative on this one instead of throwing a new design of armor and make 4000 mages whine to end up with a robe in 3.1 :p<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
wtf is this ? they will put 3.1 on PTR ?<br />
what freakin' PVE competition does Blizzard want if people can do Ulduar on PTR ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Testing Patch 3.1 on PTRs doesn't necessarily means testing Ulduar but I wouldn't be surprised if they did some testing, not testing raid instances usually ends up with terrible things like BWL. (They're getting experienced at designing raid content though, they didn't even have to test Kil'jaeden on PTRs and it worked pretty well ^^)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's the Gift of the Naaru and is entirely unrelated to shaman other than the fact that draenei can be one. Here's a picture of a pally sporting the same light show (http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/wowwiki/images/0/0b/BlessingoftheNaaru.jpg).<br />
<br />
The symbol in the picture also differs from the Gift - the dot is placed more centrally within the hook and the upper line is on the opposite side. It could be artistic inconsistency, but it could also be a related but entirely different 'gift' - perhaps one from a power opposed to the light, say an old god that everybody knows is hanging around somewhere in Storm Peaks.<br />
<br />
I've not seen this picture before, so I've no idea about the presentation context, but it strikes me as a mob design. I mean, where's your head supposed to be?</div></div><hr />

The hunter, priest and lock are excactly the same as in the art book included with the WOTLK collector's edition. So it only figured that this is a t8 set too. (no, there weren't any other classes in the book)<br />
<br />
<br />
Look closely. It's sheets and chunks of pure metal. No mesh, no chains, no nothing. It's a plate set. <br />
What plate wielders use robes ? What colour did the Knights of the Silver Hand had on the cloth of their armour ? (Hint: http://www.wowwiki.com/Image:Epicpaladin.jpg)<br />
<br />
Exactly.<br />
<br />
The disc's on the shoulders and the floating glyph's ? Honestly, haven't you payed any attention while running Halls of Stone and Halls of Lightning ? <br />
Where should the head be ? Well darnit, perhaps on the open cavety at the top of the chest ?<br />
<br />
Look at the artwork in this way: it's a set of armour on a stand, not being worn yet.<br />
<br />
Congratulations Paladins, if that artwork is really from a tier set to be in the game you will have a better looking armour set then T2, and here's the hoping the Druid set will have the same creative mind behind our tier set.</div></div><hr />

Then what are the parts around the base of the arms (above the hands), the belt and upper legs that look like a dragon/fish/reptile's hide ?<br />
<br />
Oh, yeah.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, yeah.<br />
<br />
<br />
You are arguing that just because a set of gear looks like plate; therefore it has to be plate. This is not true and I can use examples to prove my case. Please identify any parts of the hunter t4 that resembles mesh, mail, or &quot;dragon/fish/reptile's hide&quot; in the below picture.<br />
<br />
http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/wowwiki/images/0/0f/MalenightelffullT4.jpg<br />

I can use your same argument and argue that the above picture is plate. But I don't, because I actually play this game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty sure the sign is a Draenei thing, not a shaman symbol. Doubt you'll find any Horde shamans wearing a symbol like that.<br />
<br />
Everything Blizzard makes looks like plate at first glance. I think the strongest argument for the the shaman thing is the fact that it's a skirt--something paladins haven't worn since Judgement and seem unlikely to do so again. Too many ret paladins complaining that they keep getting caught on the hems of their skirts.</div></div><hr />

All the sets are amazingly well done and should be appreciated in such times of poor itemization by Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Can't wait to see the rest. :D<br />
<br />
Personally, if I can suggest something I'd like to see, priest wise. I enjoy the priest sets, they managed to do a good job for the most part, but there's only a certain look to them as far as colors. I don't know about you, but seeing a shadow priest running around with an aura of light beaming off his stuff most certainly does not set the tone. My suggestion, if you will, would be set the priest healing set as the first shown (armor with the yellow coloring) and give the dps the fourth shown (armor with the purple coloring).</div></div><hr />

The pants like on Aethas Sunreaver and Rhonin are amazing looking. Very much a 'Dalaran goes to war' kind of set. The helmet is faceless and impassive. Unmerciful. Very bad ass.<br />
<br />
On a more editorial note... I wish they would stop making dress/skirt things look like a sack. Where's the slit up the leg? How about a slit in front? How about a knee skirt? How about some variety?<br />
<br />
Anyway, they all look pretty cool (although the rogue and hunter sets don't really impress me). Can't wait until the paladin set is released.</div></div><hr />

Some kinda half nood ritualist in feathers blood and some relics.<br />
The keyword is feathers on shoulders its totaly warhammer and that helmet is ok :P Even though there were talkings about that warhammer stole Zealots model from WoW undead model :P I actually dont think so but it looks like it ))) So its <br />
1 : 1. But did so good on all other models and slacked on warlocks :P <br />
<br />
and about whos set is there, if i saw right picture i dont think its paladin cause shamans wear kilts and pala nah</div></div><hr />

Why is everyone so obsessed with bloodfang? I actually wore that set back in the day, it wasn't great in game especially on an undead male. Really, think about it, the helm was really generic, the only redeeming quality was the shoulders. I suppose no one wants a helm that actually stands out and isn't mistaken for a quest item later in the game.<br />
<br />
And no one should be complaining about the lock set, you get to be Putress, the biggest bad-ass ever.</div></div><hr />

The rogue's eyes are actually where the &quot;mouth&quot; are and not where the eyes on the mask are. I think most people don't see that.</div></div><hr />

It has the effect, similar to Gift of the Naaru on three places. Now, shamanism is not something Naaru are about. Draenei shamans became such when descending to Broken, and when they were not able to hear the voice of the Light anymore. Therefore... it may still be paladin, rather than shaman, set.<br />
<br />
Hell, I just want to look like a friggin spacemarine wearing that set and using one of those twohand swords - chainsword lookalikes!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Terses</div><div class="date">2009-01-01, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">that concept, its in the book that came with the CE of WotLK 8ish pages from the end. the picture taken of the page here makes the cloth look kind of blueish, which might be part of the paladin argument, but in the peice it self, it is purple. and very elemental, the metal parts look more bronze'ish than gold, and under the flash, is the part of the belt that hangs down, has fire'ish looking runes.<br />
<br />
it really doesn't strike me as very paladin'ish once you see the whole picture in proper light.<br />
<br />
Though, given the quality of these sets, i am hopeful paladins will get something that is equally as amazing.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seismic</div><div class="date">2009-01-01, 06:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Umm it's pretty obvious that the giant artwork is a Shaman set by the look of the kilt, and the FIRE effects.<br />
Nothing about that set says Paladins.<br />
<br />
And to be honest it probably isn't even a Tier 8 set for anyone, judging by the look of the released t8 from the other classes, it's not dark/goth enough, unless the helm fire effects affects the eyes of the character, even so doesn't really match the look of the other sets, maybe some minor resemblance to the mage one but that's about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
WAR didn't invent that look, it comes from Plague Doctors in the Middle Ages during the time of the Black Plague.<br />
<br />
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Doktorschnabel_430px.jpg<br />
<br />
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequences_of_the_Black_Death&quot;][/url]<br />
Considered an early form of hazmat suit, a plague doctor's clothing consisted of:<br />
<br />
A wide-brimmed black hat worn close to the head. At the time, a wide-brimmed black hat would have been identified a person as a doctor, much the same as how nowadays a hat may identify chefs, soldiers, and workers. The wide-brimmed hat may have also been used as partial shielding from infection.<br />
A primitive gas mask in the shape of a bird's beak. A common belief at the time was that the plague was spread by birds. There may have been a belief that by dressing in a bird-like mask, the wearer could draw the plague away from the patient and onto the garment the plague doctor wore. The mask also included red glass eyepieces, which were thought to make the wearer impervious to evil. The beak of the mask was often filled with strongly aromatic herbs and spices to overpower the miasmas or &quot;bad air&quot; which was also thought to carry the plague. At the very least, it may have served a dual purpose of dulling the smell of unburied corpses, sputum, and ruptured bouboules in plague victims.<br />
A long, black overcoat. The overcoat worn by the plague doctor was tucked in behind the beak mask at the neckline to minimize skin exposure. It extended to the feet, and was often coated head to toe in suet or wax. A coating of suet may have been used with the thought that the plague could be drawn away from the flesh of the infected victim and either trapped by the suet, or repelled by the wax. The coating of wax likely served as protection against respiratory droplet contamination, but it was not known at the time if coughing carried the plague. It was likely that the overcoat was waxed to simply prevent sputum or other bodily fluids from clinging to it.<br />
<br />
A wooden cane. The cane was used to both direct family members to move the patient, other individuals nearby, and possibly to examine the patient with directly.<br />
Leather breeches. Similar to waders worn by fishermen, leather breeches were worn beneath the cloak to protect the legs and groin from infection. Since the plague often tended to manifest itself first in the lymph nodes, particular attention was paid to protecting the armpits, neck, and groin. It is not known how often or widespread plague doctors were, or how effective they were in treatment of the disease. It's likely that while offering some protection to the wearer, they may have actually contributed more to the spreading of the disease than its treatment, in that the plague doctor unknowingly served as a vector for infected fleas to move from host to host.<br />

Although, the back (the one you see almost all the time) is really uncomfortable. It's like creating a mini-fridge on your back...hopefully it will look better with undead.

<br />
But how is this going to translate at all to the druid tier gear, seriousley i dont see how they could translate it over. T3 was the most radical tier set for druids but it still fit into the tree hugger hippy vibe with the green dragonflight motif. But nothing in the titan art style relates to what weve seen on a druid, if blizz just do another leather set like meh tier 5 and fantastic T6 (never deleting that stuff from my bank \o/) then i will be slightly dissapointed.</div></div><hr />

More specifically, it is located in the Phat Lewtz section (Yes, it's actually labeled that), which lends credence to the fact that it's not a mob, but armor. I personally think it is the Paladin T8, and that little piece of armor that should be where the helmet is will be placed on the top of the paladin's head.<br />
<br />
Also in that section is the Priest T8 which is exactly as shown, except it also has a cowl included, which might have been accidentally excluded in the screenshot. It might have changed since then of course, but that's what is shown in the book. i wish I could upload a screenshot of it, but I have no scanner =(</div></div><hr />

I'd enjoy a throw back to the old days of 8-piece sets with 3-4 set bonuses. Even after they upgraded the T6 to 8 pieces, they didn't add in any extra set bonuses, which I thought was disappointing. It'd be nice to see them put in a little extra effort with T8, and give us more than just a 5-piece set, and some nicer bonuses.<br />

ROTFL XD<br />
<br />
Ok, now let's go to the comments<br />
<br />
DK/Hunter set: they look, to me, in some strange way very similar (at first view I said that the hunter set is the Warrior set). I'm not a fun of Horn&amp;Co (but hey, I like nipples XD), so I think I will not show the helm on my DK.<br />
<br />
Mage: 4 points here<br />
1) It is really supposed to be cloth that tier? It's more like plate to me... and the story &quot;We are battlemage yadayada...&quot; well, fail. A Mage wear cloth, a Warrior wear plate. Simple and clear.<br />
2) At the first general view, the tier remind me a burqa :asd:<br />
3) The helm is very ugly<br />
4) Except for the helm, the other Eyes on the tier remind me more a Millennium item from Yu-Gi-Oh than the Eye of Kirin Tor (I'm wait to meet a Priest who said to me &quot;It's time to duel!&quot; XD )<br />
<br />
Priest: 2 points here<br />
1) It is cloth?<br />
2) It remind me a Defias possesse by a Goa'uld (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa'uld)<br />
<br />
Rogue: very sad eyes. I can understand why XD.<br />
Bloodfang (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/1p9/images/general/ss15.jpg?rhtml=y) FTW<br />
<br />
Lock: nice tier.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aveena</div><div class="date">2009-01-02, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Imo with how quick, if you sit back and think about it, blizz has been throwing out patches and expansions for WoW the fact that they are not going absolutely crazy with the gear is completely exceptional, The gear is looking great, I love how their starting to put much more Animation and lighting effects into the gear (T8 Priest shoulders for ex.) Everyone has different tastes and there is not a &quot;Perfect&quot; style, some people are going to like the sets and some people are not, its the way it goes.. I think them moving into a mix of Si-fi looks is awesome. There is two choices wait longer for new content to come out and get stuck with T7 for longer and get amazing looking gear.. Or you get new content much faster with them just editing older graphics, such as blinkstrike. I love this game, but with my guild now clearing nearly all 25 man content in a 8-10 hour raiding period its becoming old. <br />
<br />
Reuse graphics, add ambiance effects and animation, make em look as new as you can and as badass as you can and get the damn patch out already! new content FTW!</div></div><hr />

Very true, Shammys have got some really nice looking sets recently, T6, Sunwell, and the Goldish Bronze 25man T7 have all been Smexy, I really hope our T8 doesn't look dumb</div></div><hr />

T4 was also good, kind of a perfect starting tier, you looked like a knight but nothing too extravagant.<br />

The warlock tiers are my favourite btw.</div></div><hr />

T1 - bananadin, looks like crap<br />
T2 - Judgement, pure awesome<br />
T3 - gundam set, sucks<br />
T4 - draenei paladin set, pretty cool<br />
T5 - crystal power ranger, horrendous<br />
T6 - awesome<br />
T7 - reused gundam set<br />
<br />
See any pattern here? I do, following it t8 must look awesome.</div></div><hr />

WHY DO THEY ALWAYS HAVE TO MAKE ROGUE SETS SO UGLY?!<br />
I mean, not only it's ugly because of the head, it's also not special WITHOUT the head, so you need to choose between looking unique and SO damn ugly or just looking like you're wearing any other set.<br />
<br />
Other than that the hunters look cool with their gasmask.<br />
Mages look pretty damn ugly too.<br />

<br />
I am a ret paladin and that's true for the moment i DO more damage than rogues in a raid BUT in &quot;overall damages&quot;!<br />
<br />
on several bosses we do approximatively the same DPS and we're going to naxxramas where there are lots of undead so i have more efficient spells like &quot;exorcism&quot;<br />
<br />
I will repeat myself 'cause i did say the same thing on several forums/posts<br />
<br />
ret paladins aren't cheated!! they only were balanced to be on the same step of equality with others DPS classes<br />
<br />
we've always been joked at before WOTLK and we always had to do &quot;more&quot; than other classes to have a DPS weaker than the others...<br />
<br />
we had to &quot;work&quot; harder just to make close to the other's DPS and the fact is that for the ret pally's, who kept their class even if we were laughed at , they DID learn to play the spec!<br />
<br />
and that's all what makes the difference with others : knowing how to play, with decents stats we can rule the DPS meter...<br />
<br />
but not because we're cheated only because we know how to DPS with what we'got =)<br />
<br />
I do think that rogues can even do better than pally's 'cause even in heroik i saw such a difference between some rogue's dps! 0o<br />
<br />
finally i only want to add something:<br />
plz stop to say &quot;pallys are cheated&quot; just because YOU think you've been weakened...<br />
we ALREADY have been weaken after posts like yours and many times without any prooves only saying &quot;that's not fair&quot;<br />
<br />
FOR ONCE(and i insist on it) ret pallys are VIABLE so let us play in peace and stop annoying us with your &quot;ouin-ouin&quot;<br />
<br />
thanks a lot.<br />

The rogue set on a troll is probably going to look retarded beyond measure... Good thing we can hide helmets indeed.<br />

So I'm assuming they couldn't see the set bonuses/etc to identify the sets, or to share with us.<br />
<br />
Are we sure these are the tier sets? Going through the Naxx gear, you have a colored set for cloth dps, cloth healing, and so on. Could these just be those colored sets, not the tier gear? Use AtlasLoot and put on all the mana per five cloth from Naxx 10..if you put a picture of that set (green), the dps set (blue), and the naxx 25 set (silverish) together up here you might tempted to think it was like mage T7.<br />
<br />
If you ignore the Wrathgate video, and the fact that this specifically gives class names to each look, you start to wonder. Put the warlock set on a tauren druid and I bet it looks a little more logical. When they get this info do they get something that says it's cloth? What info do they have, just the graphical data?<br />
<br />
I'm not saying this is definitely just the random drops...I'm just not sure what information the original finders had that said: Yes, this is definitely DK tier gear, yes, this is definitely priest tier gear, etc..</div></div><hr />

I totally dig the priest-ninja thing, rockin.<br />
<br />
...but the rest of it? Man, I swear the last really interesting tier gear was T3. After that Blizzard just started taking cues from Japanese animation: spikes everywhere, boring repeating patterns abound. Not even cool spikes, like T1 warrior shoulders...all stylized spikiness. Bleh. <br />
<br />
It's boring, I want wings on my priest. Big fluffy white feathery wings man. <br />
<br />
The little baby light wings on 7/7.5 just aren't enough. And clearly the crown thing was hip that they had to use it on multiple tier sets now. More of that too. <br />
<br />
Ever notice how whomever does the warlock art really hooks it up? T1- Horns. Fricking horns. They even got some full-blown wings eventually. What's up with the lock-love?<br />
<br />
meanwhile mages: lawl, always getting the shaft. <br />

It's not like they couldn't afford to do several models. Like with wotlk leveling 70-80 all the gear uses same models and colors, even the first non-set epics, that's just plain boring.. Every character in the class looks exactly the same, no variation, all that changes is the stats.<br />
New tier 8 DK and priest look nice (class stylish), but the rest omg.<br />
Playing a rogue myself and only decent looking (rogue stylish) gear on them so far has been tier 2 and cadaverous garb set propably with some lvl 70 helmet like cowl of defiance from kara.<br />
And some say why care how you look if the stats are alright, well i prefer looking like a rogue before acting like one. Put the same stats in them, but make them look something else than spacejumpsuits. I mean otherwise the game design has been pretty nice.. enviroments by the locations and character models all look great, lorewise or not, but the gear is just getting uglier by every expansion pack and patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i read a blue post explaining why they made all the models 70-80 look the same. several people complained about the mix-matched lookin gear they picked up along the way in TBC lvls 60-70. they did it so no matter what it would (somewhat) appear that you are wearing and actual set rather than having rainbow looking shoulders and goofy looking wolf face for a helm complete with a hooker outfit.<br />
<br />
it is kind of boring, but i understand WHY they did it that way. hell, it's 10 levels. although, it is insane to see every plate wearers (and there are a lot now-a-days) appearing to wear the EXACT SAME SHOULDERS.<br />

dungeon design was horrible in Classic WoW. they were too long and too easy to get lost in for the average player. too little people got to take part in the end game content due to the incredibly ridiculous amount of people it took to do the raids.

WoTLK is not an improvement. When my ten year old sister can play a class optimally at 80 after I take five minutes to explain it... <br />

does that include playing 5-mans? heroics? raids? soloing is completely easy. nothing wrong with that, imo. it also depends what class/spec you taught your 10 year old sister to play &quot;optimally.&quot; if it's a hunter, hell... stand back here and auto-shot. press a button here and there. sure that's fairly easy. or a mage... stand back here and spam fireball or ice bolt.<br />
<br />
c'mon. not giving specifics really is short changing anyone you're trying to insult. it can only encourage me to believe that you're a simpleton and your 10 year old sister has a higher mental capacity.<br />
<br />
if it were as simple as you suggest, these forums wouldn't exsist.</div></div><hr />

I had her play my mage for a handful of Naxx bosses while I put together a desk, including Patchwerk, Grob, and Noth, though I had to take over for DDR on Heigan. The only issue she had was keeping up LB consistently, but she did well enough anyway to come in forth for over-all and died only once to a dispell-happy paladin.<br />
<br />
Also, while the mage rotation isn't amazingly complex, unless you play affliction warlock, you have nothing to say about difficulty when it comes to class mechanics.<br />
<br />
Anyway, while definitely not as extreme, WoW is heading the same direction as the RTS series Empire Earth has ultimately befallen. I can almost guarantee you if things do not change, the next expansion will not break WoTLK's record sales, and finally bear truth to the game's evident demise, and Blizzard knows it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaynarchy</div><div class="date">2009-01-24, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i play a prot pally and i can definitely promise that button rotation is extremely important and a bit more complex to play than a DPS class. though it's not as difficult as it was in TBC. but it IS fun to do. and not every prot pally makes a good tank. it does have a lot to do with skill and co-ordination. tanking 5-mans is easy. tanking heroics is easy not not incredibly easy. tanking raids is a lil different. some bosses have to be kited. some you have to time the enrage timer to know when to pop trinkets/shields/racials, etc. so the raid won't wipe. the hardest roles to play, imo, is tank and heals. <br />
<br />
some tanks are decent... but the ones with actual skill and know the true mechanics of how it works is what makes it worth-while... and probably boring for DPSers such as yourself where you get to stand back and spam the same spell over and over again.<br />
<br />
what i am getting at is it's just pure fun. from a tanking stand point, WotLK is incredibly fun.<br />
<br />
i just hope the tier 8 set doesn't look like crap for pallies. bottomline.</div></div><hr />

No Plate No Paladin :P ;D, you see the light around the first picture, that's definitely the &quot;Angel&quot; Sign for a Priest, so now they don't have to die to see an angel ;D<br />

Shaman looks pretty awesome ;D</div></div><hr />

you don't know anything about original african inhabitants, their warriors used to where this big wood &quot;plates&quot; on their heads.<br />
<br />
So this would be the warrior Tier8.5 from the Gundrak Raiding Zone ;D</div></div><hr />

The paladin one better look great and if it doesn't I might cry because we have had too much of this crappy looking stuff when we are supposed to be holy and powerful not robots! (tier 7 and tier 3... eww...)<br />
<br />
I do have a feeling though that the original concept art for the Crystalforge armor will end up becoming tier 8 and my reasoning is that it looks like concept art that belongs in the WoTLK Collector's guide and as well It seems to fit very tightly with the concept of Ulduar. And if it is this then praise Blizzard and I forgive you. I believe this was discussed earlier in the thread as well I though I would present my own opinion and here is an image:<br />

It looks awful and lacks a lot of definition, and the angle is messed up, but you get the idea. <br />
<br />
I considered the inquisition while I was drawing this, the shawls and monk-like robes, the iron maiden torture device, the cossack and long capes, and whatnot. I dunno, just a thought I had about how Paladins can look more menacing, and medieval, while keeping it high fantasy :p<br />
<br />
I drew some other stuff too, but I only cleaned up this one so far. I guess you can call it the Inquisition Set, or crap, or cool lol<br />

I mean when I think of an assassin/rogue I think of stealthy dagger wielding person. I think you have rogue confused with a ninja. I really like all of these set actually. So is there going to be any dagger drops from ulduars? <br />
P.S. Ill hit 80 eventually</div></div><hr />
