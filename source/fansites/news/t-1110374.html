Blood Legion and Intent Complete All Guild Achievements<br />
Blood Legion (http://bloodlegion.com/) of US-Illidan earned every guild achievement early this morning before maintenance and Intent (http://www.intent-kt.com/) of US-Kel'thuzad did it as soon as possible afterwards. The final achievement necessary was Raid Challenges (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/5783). Congratulations to both guilds!<br />

Scholomance Preview<br />
While we are waiting for the new level 90 Heroic version of Scholomance, we went back and took a look at the revamped lower level version. There are small new mechanics, changes, and new art that make the dungeon a much nicer experience than before, so watch the video for the full experience.<br />
<br />
<br />
The entire dungeon has new art, increased texture resolutions, and the new lighting system, making for a very nice environment. <br />
Janice Barov makes many copies of herself now, requiring you to find the correct one and kill it before she will reappear.<br />
After killing Professor Slate, you can drink a potion that will give you increased damage and his model. The potion works as a shapeshift and currently persists outside of the instance. You cannot mount with it however. <br />

2012 World of Warcraft Arena Pass Coming Soon<br />
We’re pleased to announce that the 2012 World of Warcraft Arena Pass is nearly here. Starting April 10, players will be able to sign up to compete against like-minded individuals in a dedicated Arena sandbox. The Arena Pass service will feature access to the special tournament realms with level-85 character templates and epic gear from Cataclysm. <br />
<br />
As an added bonus, we have included an exclusive reward that players can earn by purchasing their Arena Pass and participating in the competition -- an Armored Murloc in-game pet. Top players will also contend for a chance to achieve the “Vanquisher” title for their live characters. Players that choose to take part in the 2012 Arena Pass will also receive access to a special level-90 realm with upgraded epic gear after they’ve upgraded their accounts with the upcoming Mists of Pandaria expansion.<br />
<br />
If you would like to demonstrate your Arena prowess, are eager for a chance to earn the exclusive loot, or just want to reserve a spot in the level-90 Mists of Pandaria Arena Pass realm, please check back next week for more details and be sure to register!<br />
<br />

Glyphs: What's with the change? Why?<br />
As with talents, we want glyphs to be a choice. Stepping back a moment, we do think there is room in the game for very easy decision -- the kind that don't stress you out for fear of making the wrong one. We don't think glyphs need to be in that category though. We want you to think about them a little bit and not just look up the accepted glyphs for your character.<br />
<br />
The old prime glyphs were not choices for anyone who cared much about their performance. We designed them to be no-nonsense throughput increasers, because we feared players would find the glyph system confusing if say a Ret paladin couldn't find a glyph that unequivocally increased DPS. But we didn't like how the glyphs actually felt. They were just a hoop to jump through -- something you might choose once for your character and never interact with again. We shoot for simple to learn and complex to master, and prime glyphs were the poster child for simple to learn, simple to master. The current glyph of Templar's Verdict increases damage by 15%. What Retribution paladin wouldn't want that glyph? (The answer is almost none of them.) <br />
<br />
Now that primes are gone, we want all of the majors to be a choice. Some of these are decisions because they have a bonus and a penalty. In these cases, we thought that the glyph without a penalty would be a no-brainer. The glyph of Riptide removes the cooldown of Riptide, but also removes the initial heal. If it just removed the cooldown of Riptide, then every decent Resto shaman would want the glyph. Without the upfront heal though you have to treat Riptide more like Renew -- trading its initial heal for more healing over time. Some shaman will want that and some won't. Some may want it for some situations only. It is, in game designer parlance, an interesting decision.<br />
<br />
Another category of major glyphs don't need this downside, because the glyph itself taking one of your precious three slots is sufficient downside. Consider the glyph of Spellsteal, which heals you when you Spellsteal. If you succeed in Spellsteal a lot, then it's a good glyph. But is it better than the glyph of Frost Nova (which lowers its cooldown)? Neither glyph may be exciting to a raiding mage, but both may feel pretty attractive to someone focused on PvP.<br />
<br />
Minor glyphs have almost no affect on performance. They are there for convenience or increasingly just fun. They should help customize your character with almost no downside (except that again you can only have 3).<br />
<br />
If we are successful with the glyph revamp, you'll see players with lots of different glyphs out there. Some players will love a certain glyph, while others won't care for it. If you still enjoy playing your character but feel you are stuck in a rut, you can try swapping out a glyph for a little variety in how you play. You won't see someone create a forum thread asking &quot;What glyphs should I use for a Fire mage?&quot; or at least if someone does create that thread, the response will be &quot;Try them out and pick the ones you like.&quot;<br />
<br />
As we continue with beta, letting us know of specific glyphs that you feel are mandatory for a particular type of player would be very useful feedback (not all in this thread, of course).

The warlock's glyph that splits the shadowbolt in 3 also causes trinkets to proc 3 times as much. Barring mechanics like Riplimp where you need a single high hit that glyph will be mandatory for locks.<br />
<br />
The concept of the majors is interesting, though currently on beta there is still a lack of glyphs. I hope to see a load of new ones to really make a choice.<br />
I also fear it will result in people having to carry stacks of dusts along on raids because different fights might require different glyphs. This is already the case for some classes and some fights, but if all the major glyphs become options you'll be reglyphing several time per raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The style is anime, obviously, but I'm seeing a Moonkin, a cheetah, a bear, a treant, and a cat form, along with a night elf and a t-rex. Why the hell the t-rex is there, I dunno, but it's a very anime-style night elf druid. ETA: Ah, I see it now. It's a night elf hunter with King Krush, Loque'nahak, and Aotona, and presumably her gaggle of &quot;tamed&quot; druid &quot;pets&quot;.<br />

who is the extremely busty chic on the picture on the wall, some of your lore hounds know?<br />
<br />
Gonna assume she's one of the Barovs, or very likely just a newer version of the random artwork doodads ... not unlike the random harem chick that shows up now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the revamp was absolutely necessary. Many of us have trouble with dungeons that aren't linear! And as an extra bonus, it gives our great god Blizzard a most excellent reason to eliminate a bunch of old pointless quests and further bury that stupid lore stuff! Ras Frostwhisper, who the heck was he? Spectral Essence? Having to actually summon bosses? Bah! Dumb old complicated crapola! I just want to walk right into a dungeon and fight a cool frost dude with cool-looking effects and that's what I'm getting! Whooo-hooo! (And as an extra-special bonus, it looks like the fight will pretend to actually be hard! I really love that!)</div></div><hr />

Not only do I prefer the old scholo to the &quot;revamped&quot; version (read made generic and linar), the choice to which one I can run has been taken away from me. I still run Old scholo now and then to farm for shards / cloth or just for nostaliga, not going to be possible in MoP. <br />

Shocking... some ppl don't like pvp to the point of not caring about... the same way some don't care about pve other than leveling to cap...<br />
<br />
My guild on a pve server doesn't give a flying #$%¨ about pvp, NOBODY does anything other than a few random bgs... one or two do some arenas, but with their own partners from out of the guild... good luck trying to get a guild pvp achievement with outside players... lol<br />
<br />
We would love if some ppl could come and do the pvp achievements for us so we could get that close to finish it too. LOL<br />

Having the &quot;guild&quot; gold to spend on acquiring a &quot;guild&quot; achievement sure sounds like it was performed by the &quot;guild&quot; to me. <br />

It's not perfectly clear, but I'd put my money on it being a picture of Lady Illucia Barov.<br />
<br />
It could be Jandice Barov (her sister?). However, given Lord/Lady and there are two pictures on the wall (one male, one female), I am guessing that is husband (Lord Alexei) and wife (Lady Illucia).<br />

Because this game has had SO many difficult, nail-biting decisions that had to be made during your character customization right? Cookie cutters have existed since early Vanilla.

I don't remember blood legion saying that. I think when they gave their &quot;official guild statement&quot; upon going 8/8h they said they were gonna prepare for MOP. I know for the horde quit wow for swtor (but maybe they came back who knows)<br />

<br />
About cookie cutters... Well let's think about it... there will always be cookie cutters if they give us options (talents and glyphs). No matter what. There will always be a &quot;better than&quot; (talent or glyph) besides cosmetic optional minor glyphs.<br />
Each XPac they're cutting off some of our choices, making chars more &quot;equal&quot; tank/damage/heal/choice wise, saying some people could be missing important talents and glyphs. What's the point on trying to avoid cookie cutters then? Now they're the ones &quot;cookie cutting&quot; our chars role, habilities, spell wise. I really don't see a point here.<br />
<br />
PS: If people don't know how to chose talents and glyphs for their different classes and roles, they shouldn't be playing at all (or they really deserve a poor performance).</div></div><hr />

its already being reduced to you are a DPS Tank or healer, you have no more choice in specs.

<br />
This change was promised to us during Wrath when they asked what other Heroic instances we wanted to see and the majority said SM and Scholo. Others wanted Strat. So not really recycled, it is revamped to be different but familiar. Yeah we all know this. Recycled is using the same assets, slapping a new level on them, and renaming them and calling them different.<br />
<br />
But I do agree, they are removing choices. Gaming has gone mainstream and they specialize in selling subs. The majority has again spoken - we like things easier (quality of life, don't want to L2P, less time in the game, blah blah). Kinda sucks because a class should be a mystery and you should be able to tell who did their homework and who is simply phoning it in. We all need to understand that the gaming atmosphere we used to know (as hardcores) is pretty well gone. I was in a guild this expansion where a guy's mother was healing us - and she was pretty awful at it but it was because there were too many buttons and choices. 6 years ago she would have been in 40s taking a back 15 slot, but in today's game she was in a 10 wiping us. Everyone has to evolve with this game or simply hang it up and find something else. Many of us from yesteryear are doing the latter, I always liked that raiding required a person to dedicate themselves to being on top of wtf to do.</div></div><hr />
