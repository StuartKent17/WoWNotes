<br />
Recent Action Against Real-Money Raid Clears<br />
We’ve recently taken action against a number of accounts that were actively participating in and/or advertising the sale of in-game raid or dungeon clears in exchange for real-world currency. Such behavior is a clear violation of the World of Warcraft Terms of Use.<br />
<br />
Of the players affected, many were members of top raiding guilds. We want to be clear that everyone we’ve taken action against had illustrated full knowledge and intent to violate the Terms of Use. Going forward, in order to ensure fair play and competitive integrity, we’ll be monitoring these activities much more closely in order to make sure that the rules are being followed. This includes selling services for real money, account-sharing, and other violations.<br />
<br />
Note that while selling assistance with obtaining items, achievements, PvP rating, or other in-game benefits for real-world currency is against the Terms of Use, selling those things in exchange for in-game gold is perfectly legitimate. Players should not feel as though participating in a “gold run” is going to result in negative action taken against their account.<br />
<br />
If you see people advertising these services, please help us keep the game clean by reporting them. If you’re unsure, here are some common warning signs:<br />
<br />
<br />
A “broker” is offering to match buyers with service-providers. Commonly, a broker will collect real-world currency from a buyer while offering gold to a guild or group that will actually provide the service. Someone offering a service is unwilling to discuss terms of payment via in-game tells, and insists on using a non-Blizzard application to communicate.<br />
<br />
Also note that Patch 7.2 includes some improvements to our reporting features to add clearer categories for reporting listings in the Premade Group Finder. We’re disappointed to see members of the raiding community participating in behaviors that clearly violate the Terms of Use, and want to be clear that such activities will not be tolerated.</div></div><hr />

Most of those horribads just bought Curve for gold, its the full ML runs that they sell for $$$<br />
<br />
And good, maybe less &quot;wts&quot; spam in the groupfinder, 30groups, turns on addon to filter out sellers, 3groups remaining.</div></div><hr />

Thinking back about it I do recall posts last expansion complaining about streamers offering to sell runs for donations. Not surprised how brazen some got given the lack of action from Blizzard.<br />

<br />
Not really, I was in a guild that used to do this back in Vanilla selling ZG MC BWL runs, the difference now is that Blizzard can make real money out of it, so they need to remove people getting paid under the table. <br />
<br />
It's just funny how they try to play it off as &quot;keeping the integrity of the game&quot; by boosting players paying other players with real money. But, they can still pay with in game gold.. oh but wait, can't you BUY in game gold now? Oh, but you are buying it all from Blizzard, so that's ok. LOL. Game integrity.. yep</div></div><hr />

The difference is that blizzard makes some money that way. <br />

It's about time Blizzard did something about this. I hope they really crack down on people selling runs for cash.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard gets the $$$ from WoW token, boosters get only gold. Blizz didn't get anything from these real money runs. That's the difference.</div></div><hr />

In one scenario, Blizzard doesn't get paid because Player A pays Player B directly. What Blizzard wants, is for Player A to pay Blizzard</div></div><hr />

<br />
Many PvP guilds would see their credibility shattered if their officer core couldn't buy ratings or achievements, and many top players are not going to offer the service for a mere fictional sum of pixels. Think about this one long and hard, Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Its their game, their rules and their profits that are being taken when someone buys a carry for real money. So yes theres a difference where and how you buy that carry, they are right to take actions on that matter just like any other company would take action when being ripped off by someone.</div></div><hr />

I agree. Historically though Blizzard has had a history of not following the evidence trail past in game communication and logs aside from Overwatch. There has been a number of cases over the years of admittance of harassment and griefing on streams with no action from Blizzard. Admittedly there is more direct financial motivation for Blizzard in this case.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, it's likely that if people had just kept that offline like they did for the better part of a decade, I don't think it would have been a problem, and we never would have seen anything like this (Especially because it would be very difficult to prove that something against the TOS was happening if all the transaction stuff took place offline). But with it all in game now... I'm glad Blizzard has taken action like this. I have no problem with someone buying a raid clear, tbh. Just keep that crap from mucking up communications and group finding in game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The WoW token you buy doesn't magically come from an AI. It is bought by a players for $20 ($5 for the permission to trade gold; $15 for the game time). The person buying the Token isn't getting free Blizzard money, it comes from another player's pocket.<br />
<br />
In other words, money is still being put into the Blizzard store. It's not a bank or the auction house from Diablo 3. If it were, they'd have legal issues (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spotnick</div><div class="date">2017-03-08, 06:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, you can buy gold with real money.. so it's just cutting the middle man isn't it? Wait, that middle man can be Blizzard now, that's why.<br />
<br />
Anyways not like it's really a good source of income when you split it by 20-25 people.. 5 man carries (challenge modes) were where the profit was.. I don't know if Mythic+ are as profitable as the MOP CM were.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The other difference is it lets Blizzard keep a closer eye on potential scammers. People sell a run for gold, the buyer pays up and then the sellers take the gold and run? Blizzard can step in and take action. People sell a run for real money and the same thing happens? Suddenly it's a much, much messier situation.</div></div><hr />

You can't withdraw money from your Blizzard store wallet which means that, once the money is in there, it will benefit Blizzard no matter what. Real cash exchanges made through services such as Paypal, on the other hand, don't benefit Blizzard in any way, shape or form.<br />

Newsflash:<br />
<br />
Blizzard is a BUSINESS. They're passionate about their chosen field, but they are still a company that is designed to earn income like every single other company in the history of fucking forever. They're not a non-profit charity. They need to protect their business model.</div></div><hr />

They broke the TOS and they are already making a living from their actual job. <br />

Well see it from blizzards point of view. If you buy their tokens for gold you pay blizzard real money, but if you buy a boost from someone else that money is lost. So buying boost directly from other players is an income loss for Blizzard, which is exactly the opposite any company want.</div></div><hr />

It's Blizzards game, that's what matters at the end of the day. People play their game, so of course they want to make money from those people. <br />
<br />
Their rules man, they can be as &quot;hypocritical&quot; as they want, it is THEIR game, it's like saying &quot;Blizz doesn't allow me to fly hack in game, why can they fly&quot; .. because it's their game.</div></div><hr />

But that money is not even going back into World of Warcraft, for the most part. It's going into Overwatch, Hearthstone and probably a new yacht or two.<br />

All those $$$ sellers are doing is monetizing their love for the game. A love which, at this point, may be just as strong or even stronger than Blizzard's.</div></div><hr />

Many carry groups only sell for cash so, once those services can no longer be sold for real money, there should be a lot less of them to go around as they scurry back to other games where they won't be punished. Spamming as well as scamming should grind to a halt. <br />

Garbage posts like this are little more than a weak attempt at trying to excuse what really is a despicable practice by the cheating scum whose deliberate actions are wrecking the game experience for honest players.<br />
<br />
It's like defending any common criminal on the basis that they are losing their job because of law enforcement. And please don't pretend that these assholes are doing is &quot;harmless&quot;. It's not, and this should be obvious to anyone with any critical thinking capacity who is prepared to look at the full picture.<br />
<br />
The harm is done because when real money becomes involved this creates an incentive for unscrupulous scum to exploit the game in any manner possible to make more money for themselves, with zero concern for the impact on the game. Among the problems caused:<br />
<br />
1) Bots abusing the group finder tool to realm hop in order to farm herbs. This makes the GF tool useless to players wanting to use it for its intended purpose. <br />
2) Bots flooding the market with &quot;cheap&quot; materials. While some morons think this is good for the economy, it is actually catastrophic. Because while you might think you are benefitting from an abundant supply of cheap materials, your ability to make gold is undercut by the same cheaters. Left totally unchecked the result of such activity would be world in which all goods are supplied by goldsellers, and the only way for anyone to get gold to buy it from goldsellers.<br />
<br />
So please, do us all a favour and bugger off with your silly notion about this all being a scheme by Blizzard to milk us for more cash at the expense of honest, hardworking people. Yes, Blizzard are in the business of making a profit off us, but their business model is to do so by providing an awesome gaming experience.</div></div><hr />

Well, technically you can still legally buy a run for real money - legally. It is just now less efficient to do so.<br />
<br />
What the problem is - scammers, the current systems in play for $/gold exchange are safe - paying someone $100 for a run and them not delivering - that's unprotected and causes issues.</div></div><hr />

And what is interesting, is when you look at the matching team's ratings, there are 7-8 guys with 2.4-2.5 and the rest are 0-1.5. Yes, it sounds like 'cool story', but it is true!

they're always gonna find a way to try to sell stuff anyway.<br />
Plus, the free account don't help, lvl 1 allowed to spam on the commerce channel, or /y in the capitals don't help either. you want to piss them off, free accounts should not be allowed to write on the /1, /2, /y. same thing for lvl 1-10 on paying account. make some sort of timer, like you're not allowed to /1 or /2 for about 10min following the connection on the server. making their bots impossible to connect, spam 10times and disconnect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, &quot;buying gold&quot; by using the token system is a way to do so without fucking up the game in the game in the process. The problem with goldselling has nothing to do with the exchange of gold between players. It has everything to do with how goldsellers ruin the game in their pursuit of getting real money out of the system. The thing that makes tokens benign to the game is the fact that no one gets money out of them. It's a way for people to spend money to get gold, but without the ability to get money out of selling gold.<br />
<br />
<br />
What the problem is - scammers, the current systems in play for $/gold exchange are safe - paying someone $100 for a run and them not delivering - that's unprotected and causes issues.<br />
<br />
Well yes, that is certainly one problem with these transactions. But like I was saying, even if you assume that the transaction itself still happens, you still have the other problem of the impact that the people who sell these services are having on the game. And what I am talking about here is the cheating, game ruining stuff they do to get hold of gold in order to pay other players to perform the boost.<br />
<br />
Obviously there are many cases of benign real money transactions that happen and don't wreck the game. The problem is that because it is a way for people to get money out of the game, the entire thing is infested with unscrupulous scumbags doing lots of shit that messes up the game for everyone else.</div></div><hr />

Third party agreements. Ive had my experience as a lowly &quot;casual&quot; in some guilds that did such along with acquaintances that raided in the kind of guilds that could run split loot farming. Some of the guilds also ran bots for mats and gold. Low level was game time codes which Blizzard eliminated with tokens. The ones that would dabble in cash still did such. In general those involved was smart and kept third party as Blizzard would not recognize such interactions.<br />
<br />
I do agree with others that streamers are one of the popularity sources for the popularity of advertisement of such runs. Blizzard took too long to take action that players thought it was acceptable. Hopefully Blizzard hits the streamers on top of the in game advertisers as this has been going on for years without action. If only in-game advertisers get hit then I still hold a negative view on Blizzards care on the situation.</div></div><hr />

Like this will pretty much kill the World First scene just because the GM's / Officers of those guilds COULD live off playing WoW thus could put the insane hours in to compete...<br />
<br />
There will be always be world 1st. I don't care if it is sponsored guild or not.<br />
Nighthold has shown us that hardcore players retire due burnout and endless grind. Most of them do not care about selling stuff for real money.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, the spin on this is... horrifying &quot;something that was ok for the last decade is no longer ok because .... reasons.<br />
<br />
It was never ok. For some unknown reason Blizzard decided to do something with it now.<br />
<br />
<br />
By the by it's still toooootaly ok guys if you pay us instead.&quot; Somewhere in the design document of Legion , written in golden letters with the popes piss is &quot;just do the oposite of everything players were used to since vanila&quot;. I've seen blizzard do some questionable shit in the past but this .... ow this is in a whole new level... fuckin speechles.<br />
<br />
How does this relate to vanilla?</div></div><hr />

Blizzard took too long to take action that players thought it was acceptable. Hopefully Blizzard hits the streamers on top of the in game advertisers as this has been going on for years without action. If only in-game advertisers get hit then I still hold a negative view on Blizzards care on the situation.<br />

That's true. I think that is because vast majority of immature players (no matter their real age) want to have steady income while playing games. It's not productive nor creative.</div></div><hr />

Personally I do not pay attention to the steams and I would of missed such if it was not for catching the discussions complaining of such. Overall as expected the fans of such streams do not make negative word of such. It takes either the ones who feel like they are being exploited or anti-fans to spread word. Another poster mentioned the stream subscriber only run gray area which is generally innocent in a exclusive patron perk kind of way to play with a celebrity while the likes of donations and subscription can be leveraged in a way to promote paid runs. For streamers this has been in my view a far longer thing happening with PVP for rank carries. So far it looks like Blizzard has only targeting PVE. If that is the case then Blizzard is probably only targeting those who advertised in game. <br />
<br />
I do hope Blizzard is also targeting streamers. Time will tell shortly if any announce being banned.</div></div><hr />

------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
I am pretty sure that maybe only a few streamers or sponsored pvp players can make enough cash to live from WoW.<br />
If someone wants to 'not starve' only from boosting other ppl... that person probably has got a huge problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Is punishing someone for acting against law (against ToS in that case) 'suffering' for that person?... For me is just another pointless 1st world problem.<br />

&quot;The sad thing is - PvE top scene is slowly dying. Remember the times when getting into top 10 of the world was something you dreamed of as a hardcore guild? Now it's more of a question if you have 20 people to stay online for 14+ hours for 1 week.<br />
Split raids are killing top guilds too. Progressing in Mythic difficulty is fun, but leveling 6 characters, farming legendaries, AP, gear on them to make 6 splitraids on heroic week is not. The reason such things still exists is understandable - heroic week is a &quot;1 more PTR test week&quot; for developers, where they can fix bugs, tune classes and so on, however from top guild perspective it's just terrible.<br />
Recruiting becomes almost impossible - it's hard to explain to any skilled player, why would he waste his time on this, when the only good outcome he gets is some cheering on twitter and some good emotions after the kill. The only thing that still attracts people to such guilds is &quot;boosting&quot; (and it's gonna be the last paragraph), because selling M+ and raid runs for a real life money helps every top guild to at least get some cash for what they do.&quot;<br />

Have you ever thought,just thought,by removing them and severely punish any kind of these actions,will actually increase the numbers of active subs?<br />
Instead of focusing on PvE/PvP Aspects of the game, players are pretty much forced into buying these kind of services. Bring back the Guild System that was in Pandaria, that worked great,kept guilds together and active. Now everyone has a 5man or 10man guild mostly for boosting and selling crap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A statement from Exorsus does not reflect the experience of all raiders. Nor does it defend breaking ToS rules. <br />
<br />
Also, boost selling does not keep the hardcore PvE scene alive. What incentive does it give to the boosted players? Why sell boosts when they can simply subtract players from their pool of 20 to keep the &quot;hardcore&quot; vibe? <br />
<br />
It's not the hardcore scene that comes off as inactive. It's the replay value.<br />
<br />
Edit: Exorsus post refers to guild recruitment and Mythic raid requirements. It doesn't give actual insight as to why they exploit the product other than &quot;we sell service for cash&quot;. It's one thing to sell runs for gold, but that's not the case.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly this..... The people who got banned here were the ones who were full blatant spamming trade talking about skype in game ect.....<br />
<br />
There are guild right now that have been selling $$$ carries for 5+years without ever having 1 player banned.... These guilds/players will continue to sell because they are smart. to be honest I doubt Blizzard will ever care enough to go after these operations because it would take some work outside of game and blizzard doesn't do that (Just loot at how long projectcarry got away selling CM's even having his toon named ProjectCarry) and he was banned once in 2 full expansions making close to 6 figures a year from what ive heard.....<br />
<br />
But regardless blizzard isn't gonna ban an exorsus or method or Blood Legion (was huge into sales when around) Regardless of how well known it is they take cash for raid.... These ban waves are to clear up trade chat of people spamming without care...</div></div><hr />

a job is a &quot;paid position of regular employment&quot;. wow is a game - just because you funnel 40 hours a week does not equate it to a job, its a hobby at best. you can make money by playing it, by streaming it or by making shitty youtube videos, but the purpose remains ENTERTAINMENT, not generating cash flow for u. no game developer gets up in the morning thinking &quot;i wonder how can i enable my players to make money out of my game&quot;, except for diablos real money auction house developers.<br />

You should probably always check what kind of guild those people are in. If they call it &quot;mythic raiding guild&quot; and are 3/10m that means nothing at all. Those bosses past the 20-man requirement are easier then Heroic Guldan. There is almost no risk if you buy from more higher profile guilds. We would for example never fuck over our reputation for a mere 600k gold</div></div><hr />

False. Blizzard taking a long time might have encouraged the offenders to become brazen in the belief that they would get away with it. Trying to argue that their inaction was a sign of tacit approval is just disingenuous. These assholes knew exactly what they were doing, they knew it was wrong, but they thought the risk was low enough to take a chance.</div></div><hr />

Firstly, what happened to you was unfortunate and it sucks that you experienced it. But at least be assured that the offending player was punished and he won't try that trick again. He may have only received a 1 day suspension, but coupled with that would have been a stern warning that a repeat offence would result in a significantly bigger punishment.<br />
<br />
In an ideal world, I agree, you should have gotten your gold back. In the real world though Blizzard have learned that to do so would open the door to all manner of abuse for which they simply don't have the manpower to address.<br />
<br />
Their approach to scams is simple: People need to be careful with how they choose to engage in any transaction/agreement with other players. At the same time, if someone tries to scam someone, they will be punished. <br />
<br />
If Blizzard always ensured that the scam victims were refunded, then people would be careless and simply rely on Blizzard to insure their risk. The result would be Blizzard having to deal with a deluge of requests that could have easily been avoided by people not being idiots.<br />
<br />
But that doesn't mean Blizzard are complacent. By punishing scammers, Blizzard makes it risky for people to try to scam others, thus helping to actively discourage the problem.<br />

There is a difference between saying something is &quot;Perfectly Legitimate&quot; and something is &quot;Supported&quot;.

There is an important distinction: can you make a living selling things in WoW? If you follow the rules, the answer is no. And that's how they want it, making sure that everyone playing is actually playing, without gold farmers screwing up the economy.</div></div><hr />

I have my doubts. Notice the real money exchange. It has nothing to do with gold exchange. But don't forget that gold can be earned around 100k at a time for 20 bucks now by legit means via Blizzard store. I am going to go out on the limb here and say a majority of the buy and sell runs are for in game currency. Then of those that are exchanged for real world currency are advertised and nagotiated outside of game on websites / skype / discords which is beyond Blizzards control or knowledge. Then you also just have blind carries for friends / family / lucky tag alongs and other things like that. Finally sure, you got some people that are just stupid and post across the game and got burned.<br />
<br />
Point is a vast majority of the people earning this achieve by not &quot;earning it&quot; and using it as a tool to get into pugs / prestiege (if it is?) / point farm / or whatever will still be getting it done.</div></div><hr />

We’ve recently taken action against a number of accounts that were actively participating in and/or advertising the sale of in-game raid or dungeon clears in exchange for real-world currency. Such behavior is a clear violation of the World of Warcraft Terms of Use</div></div><hr />

1. There will be gold sellers regardless of whether Blizzard sells it or not. There was before, and still is.<br />
<br />
2. Blizzard is the only safe gold seller. As a a guy who has bought gold 3 times in the past, 2 of those times I was scammed &quot;we mailed it to you already, didn't you check?&quot; and it took days of badgering them to even get them to block me. - no refund (this was 2 different gold sellers.

Sure , they can still do something perfectly within their rights and people can still find it moraly appalling.... At least with Legion i think they've finaly made it clear they want to get rid of the &quot;old guard&quot; completly and just turn the game into mindless consumer CoDcraft. Blizzard _RARELY_ has taken trully direct hard line interventions, usualy taking a hands off 'The comunity' will sort it aproach.<br />
<br />
In Legion alone they've broken several addons , directly, like MaxCam, EnemyGrid, 3dPosition tracking API and the ability to alter the shape of friendly nameplates (the last and only time i remember this happening was with AVR in Wrath). They've made the whole infinite treadmill bullshit with titanforging, legendaries and AP causing aaaaalot of burnout among people who actualy care about improving their character and also alot of youtubers who have to in order to keep making content, then there's the whole &quot;rich get richer&quot; legendary spec based BLP coming with 7.2, you know the one that says &quot;hey if you have a norgannon's and a prydaz you don't need anymore legendaries, but billy might just get his 6 BiS legendaries in the meantime&quot; and now THIS, wich again, say what you want this has be happening AT LEAST for the past 3 years, being able to convert gold to battlenet balance is a thing for what...a month or two...? yeeeeah all hail our gloriously atroustic saviours from delivering us from our own stupidity (as in if you're scammed for this stuff, do your damn research, don't buy shit form johny &lt;NoGuild&gt;)<br />
<br />
PS: Hell i'd rather they'd have just fucking cracked down on actual gold transactions instead of IRL money ones. Bots and gold farmers CAN throw the economy for a loop but i guarandamntee you none of the top mythic guilds were using the money to buy fucking in game gold....</div></div><hr />

<br />
The real problem I saw with this whole system was that after 3 weeks of a raid dungeon released you were unable to join a heroic raid group without &quot;curve&quot;, cause if you did not have it until then you could have bought it. The possibility that you as a random player read all the guides and are willing to put in the effort and carry your own weight is basically not even considered anymore. Just buy a run, get the curve so you can post the achievement and then you can actually play with people.</div></div><hr />

They had no stakes in it untill they added tokens and they figured out how much more money they could make if they banned these players and get everyone to sell runs for ingame gold instead. A little bit of enforcing to make some money. They don't care about the players experience or anything of the sort.

Won't change the fact that your friend will still not find any group to carry him the Nightbane mount because let's be honest, if you don't have the mount at this point you deserve to pay for it. Tell him to wait until 7.2 or 7.3 when he can duo it.</div></div><hr />

In the same statement blizzard confirms boosting for gold is ok so these guilds will probably have to sell the gold for real money after, gold will be worth even less on the black market. <br />

Another thing i don't understand is why don't they make those &quot;exclusive&quot; mythic only mounts BoE. What is the difference between paying a guild to get carried on a boss kill and buying the mount directly from AH? Again, pointless middle man, might aswell make achievements or titles auctionable too.</div></div><hr />

Yes there is the general integrity aspect, and weeding out sellers from LFG, and chat spam. However its a bit more than that:<br />
1) This helps limit potential RL scams, and money laundering schemes.<br />
<br />
2) If Blizzard was perceived to be allowing this behavior than raid runs could be considered an asset for tax purposes. Its the same reason that Blizzard cannot let you exchange your Blizzard balance back for cash, otherwise WoW gold could be assessed as a fungible asset and Blizzard would have to start complying with all sorts of financial regulation and extra tax reporting. And since Blizzard can control the rate of inflation (through gold generation) you may have US regulators dictating the total amount of gold that Blizzard is allowed to produce. This is a headache that Blizzard clearly wants to avoid, and its why they need to crackdown on any Gold &gt; $ schemes and keep any real money transactions one-way.</div></div><hr />

What epics are you buying with real money, or are you saying buying in-game currency and then using that to purchase epics is the same as buying a raid run?

<br />
I am curious why this is considered hypocrisy. Blizzard is a company, supposed to deliver something from which they make money. Nothing wrong there. However, allowing others to make money over this game ... and seemingly allowing those third parties! ... makes Blizzard open to trouble from official tax services, and that would not be good. In addition I doubt the game gets more fun when we get swamped by goldmakers.<br />
<br />
The reason this message exists at all is that the game is so succesfull that people put so much time and effort in it that boosting services are of interest. A less popular game would not have these issues as massively. It is understandable that people who put a lot of time in this game try to doubledip (having gaming fun and making money from it), well, that is now barred more clearly. So be it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mooninja</div><div class="date">2017-03-08, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They had no stakes in it untill they added tokens and they figured out how much more money they could make if they banned these players and get everyone to sell runs for ingame gold instead. A little bit of enforcing to make some money. They don't care about the players experience or anything of the sort. These bans aren't even going to be really effective either, it's just to scare off a few without much effort.<br />
<br />
First of all, they have had a stake in this since the beginning, scamming has been a part of the game since the it went live. When a paying party is the victim of a scam, they are less likely to continue with the service through which they were scammed. Your comment is pure hyperbole, and rhetoric. Plenty of players have noticed an up-tic in this activity, and in no small part due to the usefullness of the group finder. Also, to address the stake, again, the token has been in the game since pretty early in WoD, if this was due to their &quot;stake&quot;, why would they only address it now? They've had the same stake from the moment the token went live, they receive the same amount of money from each token sale as they did then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gold sellers flooded the market with items, farmed good locations to death and imbalanced the economy but they were also motivated to push into game breaking activity for quick profits to get gold to sell. They also scammed, cheated, stole and hacked peoples game accounts and bank accounts.<br />
<br />
The game time tokens (which are being applied to more services) provided a legitimate and safe alternative that could be regulated and controlled according to natural market forces while bleeding gold sellers dry. Plus it being tied to game time and other services helps mitigate the effects of gold buying and provided people with gold a means to buy game time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
because they need nolifers to grind 24/7.<br />
and they need casuals to pay for tokens<br />
<br />
then they give the nolifers a reason to carry the casuals.<br />
<br />
that way they earn as much money if not even more money as if they had the highest subcount back in the day.<br />
<br />
<br />
why they dont show sub numbers? because they are nowhere as impressive as they were in the past.. and they just dont need them anymore to show how healthy the game is.<br />
<br />
ofc. blizzard now wants to stop the realmoney runs and advertise the gold runs because everything is in blizzards hand. who knows if anybody really got banned? the real warning sign is this blue post wich will be shown on every fanpage and even gamingrelated pages around the world.</div></div><hr />

This isn't the right way to go. Instead of selling the runs for USD they'll just sell the gold now. Everybody does that in the hardcore community. It's not abuse, it's something you earn the right to do whilst supporting a 13-year-old game which you've committed tens of thousands of hours for. It doesn't harm anyone, just removes one of the two steps of possibly being scammed (first buying gold, then buying boost). To be honest I never heard of anyone getting scammed, guilds care of their reputation.<br />
<br />
On the other hand there are clearly Blizzard-affiliated gold vendors. Having reported the same person for four months in a row advertising gold services gets neither of you anywhere (except banned on the official forums for publishing his name).</div></div><hr />

I agree. Historically though Blizzard has had a history of not following the evidence trail past in game communication and logs aside from Overwatch. There has been a number of cases over the years of admittance of harassment and griefing on streams with no action from Blizzard. Admittedly there is more direct financial motivation for Blizzard in this case.<br />
<br />
What financial motivation? Blizzard gets paid for all the subs involved, whether they do the paid runs, or not. Blizzard does not offer dungeon/raid clears as a paid service, so what income are they protecting?</div></div><hr />

TO BAD! LET THEM STARVE!&quot; - The WoW comunity O_o. You're endorsing the suffering of another human being you sick FUCKS!. Like this will pretty much kill the World First scene just because the GM's / Officers of those guilds COULD live off playing WoW thus could put the insane hours in to compete...<br />
<br />
Also, the spin on this is... horrifying &quot;something that was ok for the last decade is no longer ok because .... reasons. By the by it's still toooootaly ok guys if you pay us instead.&quot; Somewhere in the design document of Legion , written in golden letters with the popes piss is &quot;just do the oposite of everything players were used to since vanila&quot;. I've seen blizzard do some questionable shit in the past but this .... ow this is in a whole new level... fuckin speechles.<br />
<br />
Using real money to purchase anything has never been &quot;ok&quot; or &quot;acceptable&quot;. They ban(and/or remove bought gold from) players who buy gold from 3rd party sites, have ever since Vanilla. They're just taking it the next step further and banning people who think they're entitled to something extra just because they devote more time into the game. This is a video game, this isn't a job, this isn't a career. If they want to eat, if they want to have a roof, let them get a real job just like anyone else.<br />
<br />
This isn't &quot;questionable shit&quot;, this is them finally taking steps to knock the top guilds off their high horse, especially after Exorsus made that statement on how they feel Blizzard should pay top guilds to play their raid content. So sorry that I'm not sorry that Blizzard is finally doing what's right for the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Boosters (hardcore players)? nope, casuals? nope<br />
For what player is this good? it will only result in less players between raid because why rerun stuff when you may not boost ppl for a little profit.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zoldor</div><div class="date">2017-03-08, 07:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They banned dummy account mostly I'm sure, maybe a few idiots with their real accounts, this isn't going to do much overall. Maybe it will lessen the overt advertising that has been going on big time in the past 2 expansions, like gold selling was in Vanilla/TBC, before blizz really started cracking down and went after glider legally. Basically people will have to stop over advertising or figure out a clever way to convert gold to money...like I don't know selling game tokens or buying stuff for people at a lower trade level, or changing gold to cash in some fashion. It isn't going to kill shit.<br />
<br />
Kill the world first raid scene because they can't sell boosts for RL cash, doubtful. Maybe blizz knows they can do this, cause the world first scene doesn't really do much for Blizzard anyways, no one plays because of the world first scene besides those guys and if the only incentive is to make money, there are better ways to do it than world first raid scene. Other games, other job courses etc. World first raiding isn't going to be the thing that brings in the big stacks of gaming cash unless they all finally agree to just stream it, as that is going to be the only way to make proper money in the world first scene without waiting for someone to pay real life cash for you to run them through something.<br />
<br />
They are trying to scratch out a living in a pretty narrow market that has very few possibilities for revenue streams. Blizz cracked down to get paid and because people got to bold. It was over looked before because it wasn't nearly as insane as going into the group finder, an in game blizzard tool, and seeing an entire list of people breaking the ToS. Gotta be a little more clever, and how many of those are really world first people and not just decent players who can make a carry group for a 15, Nightbane, drag you through Mythic EN/ToV, cause lets face it a Mythic NH isn't for sale that often at this point.</div></div><hr />

LOL<br />
<br />
Sorry no.<br />
<br />
Clearly you can't analogy.<br />
<br />
Here's another one for you since you're taking a semantic tidbit from mine to try to shoot down my argument:<br />
<br />
&quot;Considering how much money I spend on medicine every month, I've earned the right by now to resell my extra meds for some cash on the side.&quot;<br />
<br />
Or how about a revised version of my original analogy:<br />
<br />
&quot;After buying groceries from this store all these years and supporting their business, I've earned the right to stand in front of their store and re-sell my groceries to people.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
BUT more importantly, whether you process my analogies or not, the ToS is still the ToS and exchanging game services for real money is still breaking the rules.<br />
<br />
Your welcome to not like that the ToS prohibits this, but then your choice is to not sign (and therefore not play), or sign and accept the consequences if you break the ToS.</div></div><hr />

Sigh... the big difference is that you can put money in, not take money out. E.g. Your guild offers 100K gold to run toons though a raid. You do a lot of these so you buy 10 WoW tokens, which you use to add $150 to your Blizzard balance... then what? You buy a ton of hearthstone cards??</div></div><hr />

A lot of items as part of a multipack even say &quot;not for individual resale&quot; on them. Some product manufacturers even go out of their way to not put individual UPCs or nutritional values on the items.<br />
You won't go to jail if caught, but can be cut off by your supplier, or even a retail store you're buying from.<br />
Which is pretty much the same thing WoW is doing.<br />

Like it or not, WoW is a commercial product, and the owning company has every right to profit off of it, even through shop sales, and the customers do not.<br />
That's business, and it doesn't matter if someone agrees or not.<br />

Some cannot work even part time due to gaming and guild needs. Many of these poor bloaks have an existence completely subsidized by gold selling and raid selling efforts. <br />
<br />
If you eliminate the means of income then these people may not be able to pay their rents, phone bills, and internet bills. Do you want a world (of Warcraft) where only the top guilds in the world consist of people who have full time jobs? We'd lose most of the trade chat personalities on most servers. The real heroes of the game would be shuffled off to myth and legend status, never to be seen again.<br />
<br />
We went through this back in the GM/HW grind where people had to unfortunately leave careers due to the requirements of the game, it wasn't pretty. These guilds will have stunted progress, and it may require them to even not be able to log in for raid night due to internet service being cut. Oh sure, they could try to raid on phone tethered internet, but have you ever seen this? Have you? The progression race would come to a near halt. We would start to see weeks required to down entire mythic raids instead of mere days. They would have to settle for the guys who put in 40 hour weeks and may be late to raid due to requirements at the office. Someone could get called in to work at their pizza delivery job not being able to make raid that night without risk of getting fired. You'd have to bring Larry, who is a nice enough guy, but let's be honest the guy is a total carry who still stands in fires but he got his spot because he's the husband of your healing officer. Worse, if you were completely made up of students who don't have to work, maybe this will interfere with their grades, and the future cure for cancer may not happen because Warcraft got in the way.<br />
<br />
There's a lot of hate here for top guilds and players, but let's be realistic, we get to see the kill cinematics as soon as they are released, clean kill videos with dubstep music turned up to 11, go to Blizzcon in search of these heroes and their autographs, and join in on the revelry on Twitch with them. If they can't pay their bills, we all lose. Bad call Blizz. Just sayin'.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not bollocks ... what do you expect, this game should be free, Blizzard should be a charity? You'd like Blizz to freely and willingly set up a complicated infrastructure supported by their army of employees to make it possible for YOU, a schlub, to turn the game into your OWN digital marketplace, which YOU profit from? No rules, do what you want, sell ERP on the corner of Goldshire for all they care?<br />
<br />
In what whacky world does this make sense? Blizzard isn't eBay. They're not there to provide you a mercantile platform which you can use and profit from.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard didn't want people to buy gold because it could ruin the &quot;game economy&quot; - Yes, I'm laughing. It's their game, so they get to decide. Then, they decided they could be the one's selling gold and it was okay. Honestly, they just wanted to be the only one's profiting off their game. <br />
<br />
The Gold Seller's evolved to start selling runs through raids, selling BoE items, power leveling chars, reps, etc. Again, Blizzard is pissed that they found yet another way to profit off their game. I am not waiting for the Blizzard Store to sell reputation. <br />
<br />
At the end of the day it's their game. They got the money for the game + expansions, the subs, now the gold selling, mount selling, etc. Why do they care if people are paying to have their characters geared? One reason; SHOW ME THE MONEY!</div></div><hr />

I would argue that Blizzard isnt selling gold, just allowing players to trade gold/money within the game, they can also make sure this happens safely, blizz cant do that with 3rd partysites etc. Overall its a good thing, maybe less spam in the groupfinder or general chat now, for a couple of weeks.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard is absolutely, 100% selling gold for money. You go to the store, you spend money to get a token, which turns into gold.<br />
<br />
That's why this whole thing is hypocritical. If you buy your gold from Blizz and use it to buy a boost, that's ok in their book. But if you buy your boost directly it's horrendous!<br />

Tbf, real money transactions for in-game services was against the TOS long before the wow token was introduced. It's been going on all these years all the same though, seeing as how Blizzard could never PROVE that someone has spent cash for a service.<br />
<br />
What they can crack down on, is the people blatantly putting their faces on real money boost services (Sco for example) and account sharing. I'm sure the boosters have some way to circumvent the account-sharing issue as well though...</div></div><hr />

It's been going on all these years all the same though, seeing as how Blizzard could never PROVE that someone has spent cash for a service.<br />

But for most of those years Blizz wasn't selling gold for money themselves. Since they started doing it the whole thing has gotten pretty hypocritical.</div></div><hr />

The same scams exist. Double standard. Blizz is ok with the scams, as long as they are getting a cut.<br />

A) Nobody said Blizzard don't take action against gold scamers, that was not being discused here. They usually do if you have screens of a negotiation and then they don't give you what was acorded.<br />
<br />
B) Obviously thet care for they money. As everybody does. If that surprises you, you can return to whatever comunist contry spawned you.</div></div><hr />
