Dev Interviews - Legion PvP<br />
Holinka talked about Legion and Warlords PvP on the arena steam this weekend. You can watch the interview here (http://www.twitch.tv/wow/v/11093762?t=122m30s).<br />
<br />
Legion PvP<br />
<br />
There won't be gear with Resilience, PvP Power, dual item levels, or gear specifically made for PvP. <br />
The team doesn't want people to feel that they must have PvP gear to participate in PvP.<br />
When you enter a battleground or arena, the game will set your stats from your spec, not your gear. This means all of your stats will come from a template specific to your spec. If one spec isn't doing well in PvP, their spec's template can be tuned individually.<br />
PvP talents plus the spec stat templates will allow the team to tune balance in arenas and battlegrounds much better than they ever have been able to do before.<br />
PvP right now uses gear as a progression system. Once players get their full set of gear, many of them are done. <br />
PvP Talents try to take the place of the progression that came from gear.<br />
Trinkets, set bonuses, and enchants will not be active in PvP. <br />
Right now players stack enchants, set bonuses, and trinkets, lining them all up at once to do a lot of damage. Outside of when all of those are up, players don't feel like they are doing much damage. This should help to make sustained damage a bigger part of PvP.<br />
Once players reach the max PvP level, they can reset it to gain a Prestige level. This gives access to different cosmetic rewards. <br />
When a player reaches PvP level 10 (roughly 20% of the way there), they will have unlocked an option in every row. <br />
The CC break trinket has become very important in PvP, so adding it as a PvP talent will offset the loss of active trinkets. There will be some other options in that row that might be useful, such as reducing CC times by 20%.<br />
The team hasn't decided exactly what they are going to do with the Human racial. They could leave it alone and offer a different talent in that row to Humans. The racial plus the new options could be too good.<br />
As you get better gear, your stats are increased a smaller amount. For example, every 5 item levels may give you a 1% stat increase. This way gear still will increase your power, but it won't give you a huge advantage. <br />
There are plans for players to be able to get great gear from PvP, but it may not be as easy as it is today. It may be easier for high rated players to get better gear than more casual players.<br />
You won't have to raid to get the best gear for PvP.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warlords PvP<br />
<br />
Spectator mode and the new player run tournaments have been exciting.<br />
The team was happy with how skirmishes worked out. It gave players who didn't have their arena partners online the opportunity to play some arenas, as well as other players that wanted a break from leveling or gearing up.<br />
Battleground strongboxes worked out well. Players were able to get different gear in a more unpredictable way.<br />
The Group Finder was a great addition. It allowed people to find others to play with.<br />
Ashran fell short of where the team and players would have liked to see it go. During the ramp up to Warlords, there were a lot of people excited about a new world PvP zone that had a large area and epic battles. <br />
The team didn't execute on that idea. They have tried to make changes based on player behavior and feedback, making mistakes along the way. They have done things like putting exclusive rewards in Ashran to make them feel special, which resulted in lots of negative feedback.<br />
The current state of Ashran can be fun for people that are interested in that type of experience. The people who don't want to do Ashran don't have to. <br />
They have learned a lot from the experience about rewards and driving players to fight each other. Hopefully next time the team tries something like Ashran they can execute better.<br />
The dual item level system worked, but it was ugly. Players had two item levels on their gear, with their item level increasing suddenly in combat, which means they couldn't see their states. PvE gear also hit the invisible item level ceiling. Players who didn't PvP full time still felt compelled to go and get PvP gear so that they could do PvP. It was a cool system, but it fell short in a lot of ways.<br />
MLG and ESL have shown interest in WoW. <br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
The Shaman one should be more than a &quot;cave&quot; overlooking the Maelstrom, more like a small city built into/out of the cliff.<br />
Calling it a &quot;cave&quot; was perhaps an underwhelming description. Definitely more custom/open than what comes to mind hearing that. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/630561878687617024))<br />
<br />
Character / Items<br />
Artifact's stats will still improve as you defeat BOSSES, Relics: completing major quest lines, DUNGEONS, &amp; RAIDS...<br />
The more difficult the content you do, the higher your weapon's DPS will be. That's been true since 2004, no? (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/630609754210103296))<br />
<br />
UI / Addons<br />
as someone who still uses the default UI, is there any chance that you guys might finally revamp it completely?<br />
I use the default UI! What do you want improved? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/630639878171049984))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
We're really excited about #Legion, and can't wait to share more info with you, but this account will stay focused on #Warlords for now. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/630882479209975808))<br />
Once the expansion is further along in development, we'll begin discussing expansion-related topics here. Stay tuned! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/630882531785609216))<br />

Computers - Setup of the Month<br />
Each month or so we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
The current SSD prices (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/august/ssdgraph.gif) are fairly flat right now, with most SSDs under $0.50 per gigabyte when on sale. <br />
<br />
New CPUs from Intel and GPUs from AMD are here, but they aren't huge improvements over the previous generation. <br />
<br />
Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VKVZ1A?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002VKVZ1A). <br />
<br />
Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or streaming, you do not need the 6700K and should spend that money elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date.<br />

The problem with that is the idea some class halls won't be in world. They'll be right under dalaran (rogue) while someone elses will be out in BFE. This can feel a bit unfair if you're the rogue that only has to walk down a flight of stairs to visit his while the paladin might have to go way out to eastern plaguelands. There are other ways to get out into the world. This is not one of the ways I want to see blizzard force it. If class halls are anything we should expect to visit on a daily basis, and login once a day for, then I want it to be something that's reachable from town.<br />
<br />
They just need to make sure EVERYTHING ELSE is in world like gathering, content, etc.</div></div><hr />

Yeah let's wait and see what they've come up with, then sit around in 6 months and say 'told you it was a stupid idea!' and listen to Blizz saying 'hmm.. yeah we learnt lessons from that, blah blah blah...'<br />
<br />
Or we could, you know, provide our feedback while things still have a chance (however slight) of being changed...<br />
To put it another, more extreme way, if Blizzard said they were planning to remove all forms of combat, exploration and questing in the next expansion (it's just going to be GarrisonCraft 24/7), would you really just say &quot;let's just sit around and see how that turns out before worrying about it&quot; or would you tell them straight up that it's a stupid idea?<br />
<br />
<br />
I do hope Blizzard don't cave in to the masses and have portals zip us in and out of class orders.<br />
So some classes have to fly-um.. walk across the world whenever they need to go to their hall while others just pop under/next to the capital?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I could be completely wrong, but the way I interpenetrated the class halls is a place you have to visit in order to progress a quest story-line, not a daily visit as they didn't want to create another hub like Garrisons where people camp out and instead push us all back into Dalaran.<br />
<br />

<br />
I think I'm biased as I just miss the glory days, when we used to ride out on our 60% speed mounts to the gates of Org to catch a zeppelin to Stranglethorne and then pony up and ride off to the instances/raids/PvP bashing...and yet the best thing of all is, none complained about how long it took...it was just accepted as the normal. Ganking outside of Azjol-Nerub before a 5 man heroic...killing in the gates of Scholomance<br />
<br />
Give people portals, hearthing, flying, instant movement, LFG finder and we'll all use the easy way...but if they never introduced them...I wonder if we ever would have complained - I love LFD and flying, but I do think it has caused most of the grief that plagues the game today. I for one wouldn't mind trekking out to EPL Light's Hope once a week for a quest....might even gank a player or two in EPL/WPL whilst there</div></div><hr />

Noob =/= player without gear.<br />
Noob = player, who don´t know the game and don´t know how to play class.<br />
<br />
If someone don´t have so much time to spend in a game, it´s not a noob player. Now we will see who is a real noob, when gear will not matter anymore. It won´t be about playing the game 10 hours a day to be the best, but about real skill of the player.</div></div><hr />

Ayup, if the bolded part isn't irony I don't know what is.<br />

<br />
Daww, kiddie want a cookie? This is what they've done since literally the inception of the game. Vanilla was largely based on the MMOs that came before it. It's what they've always done, and it's always been combined with ideas of their own, sometimes working for them and sometimes working against them.</div></div><hr />

What because they are going back to something of how it was in Vanilla and that you can no longer roflstomp others??<br />

<br />
Maybe it might make those type of players to actually learn how to play their class rather than rely on the crutch that is gear.. Heaven forbid that PVPer's actually use skill to play the game..<br />

Yeah the best days of PVP were in vanilla when you could show up to a BG in any gear and have a blast.. PVP started going south when Blizzard added in PVP specific gear..</div></div><hr />

Except this was definitely not a thing in Vanilla? You needed gear, whether it was from PvP or from raiding - poor gear meant poor performance. &quot;Showing up in a BG in any gear&quot; is much more true in WoD than it's ever been.</div></div><hr />

It was more rock-paper-scissors with classes back then. For instance, a warrior decked in blue 5-man gear could easily shit on a Rogue that was wearing full tier2.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I am glad that they are FINALLY fixing pvp for real. This actually makes me want to come back.</div></div><hr />

Haven't you followed the posts? They've stated as early as when they announced it - There will be PvP means of getting gear.<br />

It was raid or die back then if you expected to win in PvP. Major mistake to go back to that again since there are a lot of people who don't care about raiding but want to progress in PvP instead. WoW will lose several million more subs if they go down that route again.<br />
<br />
We can only imagine the outcry if PvE people were forced to PvP to be good in PvE.</div></div><hr />

Or remember how you could raid in your PvP gear? Friend of mine once mentioned killing the 3rd boss in BWL from 20% with a warrior tank using his grand marshal gear and 2 hander cause the other tanks had died, and totally GG'd the kill.</div></div><hr />

I'm going to side with what Ghostcrawler once said: I'd love to hear that! It'd be a great change! (when discussion making things &quot;too hard&quot; in Cata)<br />
<br />
So yeah, I'd LOVE to see more PvE'ers &quot;forced&quot; to do PvP if they want &quot;the best&quot; -- but hey, you don't *need* the best, right? You just WANT it so it's not big deal. I'd love to hear the PvE'ers QQ for a single patch. -- like how much they cried when they had to do BG's for the MoP legendary. It was hilarious.</div></div><hr />

There was no major difference between PvP gear and PvE gear other than a little more stam on PvP gear. PvP gear was also infinitely harder to get with the old ladder system than PvE gear was.</div></div><hr />

Mist of Pandaria legendary cloak. Need I say more? We were forced into completing 2 of the new BG's they introduced. It took me over 20 temple of Kotmogu games to win a single one. Silvershard Mines wasn't so bad.<br />
<br />
Besides, what PvE content are PvP'ers FORCED into doing? Absolutely nothing, not since Vanilla have I seen players pushed into doing PvE in order to benefit their PvP game. Mist of Pandaria World PVP maybe, but that's not where the main core of the PvP community lies, the main core is BG's and Arenas, and in Legion it might be the only time since Vanilla that a PvE geared player might just -maybe- be competitive with a PvP player.</div></div><hr />

That's why it's a bad idea to force people to do what they don't want to in WoW. Keep PvE and PvP separated, with different gear and differant routes.<br />
Trying to force a gamestyle on players wil just see them unsub.<br />
<br />
I don't get players who think their way of playing WoW is the right one and all others are wrong. The game is big enough for two routes, PvE and PvP.<br />
<br />
Myself I hate PvE and if it's raid or die again then I'm out.</div></div><hr />

Oh right I see you're one of those that hasn't paid attention to the multiple places that it has been stated by Blizzard developers that you do not have to raid in order to have the best gear to do PvP, and you do not have to raid to even have gear for PvP at all.</div></div><hr />

I see so many fresh 100s that just run around and after 3 min they just stop trying anything because they are just constantly getting destroyed so there is no point in them even playing. They run in hit one skill get stunned and they are dead before the stun even runs out dead in seconds.

Why a 1080p monitor in the high end setup? I'd check out upgrading to 1440p or even a budget 4k from like monoprice.<br />

Cost. Once you go up to 1440p you need a better GPU, spend more on the monitor, and have to upgrade your GPU more frequently to play at high settings. We are getting closer to 1440p making sense at the high end, but not quite there yet.</div></div><hr />

PvP should have never been about gear - only skill. There's no fun in owning someone with less gear than me, and vice versa, there's no fun in being owned with someone who has more gear than I do.<br />
<br />
PvP is about skill, not gear, and should have been that way from the very beginning. I'm glad they're finally implementing this change. I hope it's not too little too late.</div></div><hr />

Ganking outside of Azjol-Nerub before a 5 man heroic...killing in the gates of Scholomance<br />
<br />
Give people portals, hearthing, flying, instant movement, LFG finder and we'll all use the easy way...but if they never introduced them...I wonder if we ever would have complained - I love LFD and flying, but I do think it has caused most of the grief that plagues the game today. I for one wouldn't mind trekking out to EPL Light's Hope once a week for a quest....might even gank a player or two in EPL/WPL whilst there <br />

Don't post their name please, there's enough of them running around, you don't want new ones. <br />

And, they're not going anywhere. That bot software isn't about gear, it's abusing the system to play flawlessly, and players will still lose to them with instant silences/kicks/etc, and it's about auto-grinding honor, which they'll still be able to do in the new system.<br />

A spriest for example, values stats differently based on their level 100 tier talent. Mastery is worth a lot less for auscpious spirits builds. How will their system compensate for this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard are finally getting serious about PvP (after 10 years mind you) and normalizing stats in Arenas/BGs to make things fair. You'll be able to wear whatever you want since it will be 99% cosmetic in PvP, having high-end raid gear will only make a few % difference at most.<br />
<br />
What really annoys me is really the fact that this should've been implemented YEARS ago back in BC/WotLk when arena took off. Blizzard somehow convinced themselves it was possible to balance 10+ classes in both PvE and PvP at the same time using the same sets of abilities. They dicked-around with that concept for so many years, players faced so much frustration, the solution was so simple...and NOW they do it? In the 6th fucking expansion??</div></div><hr />

Interestingly enough, 1440p though for WoW runs fine on a 970, and I imagine with the setup you have you'd see solid framerates. I used to run a 2500k processor and a card less than the 970 and get respectable framerates @ 1440.<br />
