What's Changing (and Not!) in Season 2<br />
Hi all,<br />
<br />
We have a series of blogs accompanying the release of the upcoming Battle of Dazar’alor raid, the new Mythic Keystone season, and the new PvP season, offering deep dives into each of those features. But in the meantime, the community clearly has a ton of questions (and some confusion) about exactly what is and isn’t changing. Should you be spending or saving your bonus rolls? What should you expect from the weekly Mythic Keystone cache next week? What’s up with the Azerite vendor?<br />
<br />
For those of you who played Legion, the process will largely be familiar, though in Battle for Azeroth we’re trying to align the opening of a new raid tier with the start of new PvP and Mythic+ seasons, to avoid some of the awkward item-level leapfrogging that we saw during Legion (e.g. the Mythic Keystone cap repeatedly going up to 15 and then back down to 10). Here’s a succinct summary of what is and isn’t changing next week, when Battle of Dazar’alor opens on Normal and Heroic difficulties, and PvP and M+ Season 2 begin:<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
<br />
The maximum possible item level will go up by 30, from 395 to 425.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warfronts<br />
<br />
Arathi/Stromgarde rewards will remain as they were previously.<br />
Darkshore rewards will go up by 15 item levels, so that the outdoor world boss and the once-per-cycle quest both award item-level 400 gear.<br />
The power of all enemies in the Darkshore Warfront will also go up by roughly 15%, and the item level required to queue for Darkshore will go up from 320 to 335.<br />
Special note: The two Darkshore changes will only take effect after the current Warfront cycle has ended. So if Alliance is attacking Darkshore in a given region when Season 2 begins, and has 3 days left in that attack cycle, that Darkshore will still give Season 1 rewards.<br />
<br />
This is being done to avoid any unfairness to people who had already completed the Warfront or done the world boss just prior to the season rollover.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Kul Tiras and Zandalar World Content<br />
<br />
Emissary weapon and armor rewards will scale up to 385 (based on a player’s own item level), up from 370.<br />
The loot from Kul Tiras and Zandalar world bosses will remain item level 355, on par with Normal Uldir.<br />
The rewards for in-progress emissary quests may reroll or update when Season 2 begins, though the quests themselves won’t reset or change.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons<br />
<br />
The item level of rewards from max-level Normal, Heroic, and Mythic dungeons will go up by 30. Baseline rewards will be 340 from Normal, 355 from Heroic, and 370 from non-Keystone Mythic.<br />
Difficulty of Heroic and Mythic dungeons will also go up by roughly 30%; Normal dungeons are unchanged.<br />
Mythic Keystones will go down by an additional 3 levels when the season transition occurs, to account for this difficulty increase. So if you do an 11 this coming week, instead of getting a Level 10 keystone when Season 2 starts, expect a 7.<br />
Mythic+ rewards will also go up by 30 item levels; however, during the first week of Season 2, rewards from end-of-run chests will be capped at Mythic 6 quality (item level 385), and the chest you open next week will contain Season 1 rewards if you do a Mythic+ run this week. (So, for example, if you do a Mythic 10 during the final week of Season 1, you’ll get a Season 1 item level 385 piece and 60 Residuum from your first Season 2 chest.)<br />
The weekly cache that becomes available in the second week of the season will not be affected by this cap, so if a player does a Mythic 10 dungeon during the first week, they will get a Mythic 10 reward (item level 410+) from their cache the following week.<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
<br />
Season 2 rewards from rated PvP sources are 30 item levels higher than they were in Season 1, including Conquest rewards and the weekly chest.<br />
End-of-match rewards will be capped at 385 during the first week of the season, to maintain parity with other endgame systems until Mythic Battle of Dazar’alor becomes available.<br />
<br />
<br />
Azerite Armor<br />
<br />
All epic Azerite armor of item level 370 or higher, obtained from Battle of Dazar’alor, world quest emissaries, Season 2 dungeons, or Season 2 PvP, will have a fifth outer ring with additional spec-specific traits.<br />
<br />
This outer ring only requires a Heart level of 15 to access.<br />
<br />
Titan Residuum is not reset or capped between seasons.<br />
The Residuum vendor will offer item level 385, 400, and 415 pieces for sale in Season 2.<br />
<br />
A random item-level 385 token costs 165 (as it does today)<br />
A random 400 costs 675<br />
A random 415 costs 1725<br />
A specific item-level 415 armor piece costs 7150<br />
<br />
Just as Residuum costs roughly triple with each 15-ilvl tier, so will rewards:<br />
<br />
Disenchanting an item level 400 Azerite piece yields 115 Residuum<br />
Disenchanting an item level 415 Azerite piece yields 365 Residuum<br />
A weekly cache for a Mythic 4 in Season 2 awards roughly the same 60 Residuum that a Mythic 10 did in Season 1; a Mythic 10 in Season 2 will award ~625 Residuum<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Miscellaneous<br />
<br />
Seals of Wartorn Fate are not being reset, and the same currency will work for Battle of Dazar’alor and Season 2 bonus rolls; the cap on how many can be held at once remains at 5.<br />
<br />
<br />
If anything remains unclear or seems to be missing from the above, please let us know and we’ll try to clarify as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
Zandalari &amp; Kul Tiran Allied Race Testing<br />
We’ve seen some confusion about the unlock requirements for Zandalari and Kul Tirans, and how that relates to testing them on the PTR. We’d like to clarify where things stand currently, and what our plans are once they’re officially released.<br />
<br />
The basic requirements to unlock Zandalari and Kul Tiran are as follows:<br />
<br />
<br />
Exalted with that race’s faction<br />
Completed the content achievement for that race (“Zandalar Forever!” or “A Nation United,” respectively)<br />
Completed the Tides of Vengeance War Campaign achievement<br />
<br />
<br />
On the PTR, we’ve enabled the last part of the War Campaign earely, so that the Allied Race unlock quests can be started. As long as you satisfy the other requirements, and are at 3/4 of the requirements for the Tides of Vengeance War Campaign achievement, you’ll be able to speak to Nathanos on the Banshee’s Wail or Halford Wyrmbane on the Wind’s Redemption to get started unlocking Allied Races on the PTR.</div></div><hr />

Yeah nothing wrong with that kind of curve or anything. :rolleyes:<br />

I mean it dropping 355 gear is fine in Darkshore. But you shouldn't get a fucking Heroic Dazar'alor piece from something that's easier than LFR or even a Heroic Dungeon.</div></div><hr />

I mean... Those two races aren't even coming for a another 2 to 3 months.... so.... yea, they'll require you to play both factions to get both, it's not really that hard. If you don't have the faction exalted already, you've got plenty of time.</div></div><hr />

I let my sub run out two days ago because I wanted to level an alt but don't want to waste my time while I wait for the race/class combination to be unlocked. It's a really shitty MAU strategy</div></div><hr />

How is it any different from similar rewards from previous expansions. Timewalking Dungeon quest giving a Raid piece of gear. Basic Mythic Quests giving Raid piece.<br />
<br />
Stop caring so much about other people getting 1 piece of gear a week.<br />

Also, coming from someone whose done both:<br />
<br />
The Horde achievement is as follows:<br />
1) Complete all three Horde Zones<br />
1.5) I don't event think you need to be 120, I remember doing this on my DK at 119<br />
2) 30 minutes of going around Zuldazar<br />
3) CONGRATS YOU'RE DONE!<br />
<br />
The Alliance achievement is as follows:<br />
1) Complete all three Alliance zones<br />
1.5) Get 120<br />
2) Quests. Lots of them.<br />
3) Tol Dagor Dungeon run<br />
4) Quests. More of them.<br />
5) Shrine of the Storm dungeon run. I might add throughout these dungeon runs its &quot;collect X, Kill the Last Boss&quot;<br />
6) MORE Quests.<br />
7) Waycrest Manor Dungeon Run. By this point I was about to quit when I did this shit.<br />
8) HEY GUESS WHAT! MORE QUESTS! Jaina's 'Redemption', etc.<br />
9) And now for something completely different... MYTHIC Siege of Boralus. Unless they added Heroic SoB, I don't know. Can't remember.<br />
10) And now you're done. Congratulations on probably the longest achievement chain in BfA. I mean shit not even the Prepared for War achievements were this drawn out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They added heroic SoB and Kings rest in 8.1, and also removed the previous requirements to &quot;unlock&quot; them. <br />
<br />
And I kinda agree, the horde side should've had a series of quests where you do 3 dungeons (mainly Atal'Dazar, Temple of Seth and Underrot) as part of the chain to do the final scenario. Motherlode isn't part of the main horde story arc and is more of a side quest. Unlike Tol Dagor which is relevent to the alliance, as you deal with Ashvane forces. What I found weird when doing the alliance chain is that you raid the uninstanced version of freehold instead of doing the actual dungeon (which would make more sense). You could avoid doing freehold until after you done that chain and everyone is like &quot;You killed Sweete, lets still his chest&quot; even though your character has never killed the guy.</div></div><hr />

On one hand, yeah, it's really nice way to make sure dungeons and world quests don't become useless once you've already geared up! On the other hand, such 'catch up mechanics' will make the current raid (and War Front) pointless and skippable entirely by everyone.<br />
<br />
While I do prefer a system of Dungeons &gt; Raid 1 &gt; Raid 2 &gt; etc (Or simply the M+ difficulty increase)... with the way the game is now I suppose the reward boost is welcome! \o/</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyone who is under the illusion that it's nothing but a business strategy to draw out the longevity of the xpac is delusional. This would be akin to Blizzard making us go through 6 months and 1.5 patch updates to access Blood Elves and Draenei or Goblins and Worgens</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is being done to avoid any unfairness to people who had already completed the Warfront or done the world boss just prior to the season rollover. According to approximate calculations, the Darkshore will go into scenario phase for Alliance 1-2 days before season rollover. Stay classy Blizzard, you gave free hc Uldir item to Horde week 1 of Uldir, but Alliance can't have free 400 item this time, let's wait the whooole cycle to switch around until the item is no longer relevant at all.</div></div><hr />

And I kinda agree, the horde side should've had a series of quests where you do 3 dungeons (mainly Atal'Dazar, Temple of Seth and Underrot) as part of the chain to do the final scenario. Motherlode isn't part of the main horde story arc and is more of a side quest. Unlike Tol Dagor which is relevent to the alliance, as you deal with Ashvane forces. What I found weird when doing the alliance chain is that you raid the uninstanced version of freehold instead of doing the actual dungeon (which would make more sense). You could avoid doing freehold until after you done that chain and everyone is like &quot;You killed Sweete, lets still his chest&quot; even though your character has never killed the guy.<br />

They want heroic raiders to do it every cycle too. Honestly, It should scale with your item level. Everything should to a point. <br />
<br />
World quests should be capped at 360 and you should get a piece 10 item levels above yours. So a world quester would cap at 370 or 375 piece. Having Lfr gear from doing world quests should be enough. I want to do actual end game stuff, but theres no point when I can get higher in the world. <br />
<br />
I'm at 375 item level and ive never stepped foot in a normal raid or mythic+ dungeon. Thats insane. <br />
<br />
<br />
I propose we get rid of titanforging. Warforging stays but caps at 10. Valor comes back and is 500 to upgrade +5 item levels. If a piece warforges +10 you cant use valor on it. <br />
<br />
Normal dungeon 310<br />
Heroic dungeon 325<br />
lfr 340<br />
world quest cap 340<br />
Mythic dungeon 340<br />
Emmisary cap based on item level up to 370. With no titanforging the best possible non warforged peice for a world quester will be 350. They cant get higher unless they step into more difficult content.<br />

Well, Zandalari's unlock require :<br />
Be Exalted<br />
Zandalar Foreva<br />
<br />
Which are both available since the second week of the expac, so no, it doesn't make any sense to keep them locked until 8.1.5 or 8.2 or whatever. Zandalari and Kul'Tirans are technically allied races of Horde/Alliance since the two main Finales, which already occurred for everyone 3+ months ago.

Mythic+10 non warforge 380<br />
Mythic raid 385<br />
<br />
The average world quester will be 340-345. Perfect to start raiding. Plenty of character progression still. Honestly id be fine with titanforging staying as long as its only in raids and maybe Mythic+ caches. <br />
<br />
There should also be an incentive to step into normal+ raiding imo. Something like 500 valor, 2500 AP, and 2000gold weekly to kill a late boss in the current raid. Nerf it for future tiers but keep the weekly.<br />
<br />
So When BDA releases in a week the weekly quest for Uldir would only reward 150 valor, 500 ap and 500g. Still fairly lucrative if you can clear it pretty fast. 1000Valor cap a week. <br />
<br />
Heroic dungeon completion 50 valor. World quests give 5 valor. Mythic dungeon gives 100 valor. Each current tier raid boss gives 25 valor. Oldier tier bosses give 10. Emmisary completion gives 50.<br />

Horde: the time it takes to go from 110-120. Stick to the main quests for each zone and you'll get it before 120<br />
<br />
Alliance: 110-120 + some time at 120 to do the quests, dungeon, quests, dungeon, quests, dungeon, quests, dungeon.<br />

The wording and meaning of this statement really shows that modern wow isn't about gear progression through tiers(or seasons), it's about a bracket all players work on within certain periods of an expansion.

this is actually quite simple - just like WQ cache rewards being class not spec specific <br />
<br />
its done to slow people down and make sure they stay subbed for longer. <br />
<br />
notice how they also didnt change world boss rewards besides darkshore boss - making all initial WB not worth to do . also to slow people down<br />
<br />
i personaly dont mind - give me time to level up alts instead run all of them through arathi wF - this alone will be worth like 1 new alt per cycle with how many alts i have :)</div></div><hr />

Yeah nothing wrong with that kind of curve or anything. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
I mean it dropping 355 gear is fine in Darkshore. But you shouldn't get a fucking Heroic Dazar'alor piece from something that's easier than LFR or even a Heroic Dungeon.<br />
<br />
Let's be real, for the time you can try for a second 400ilvl piece (the second time the warfront is up) you will already be mid way HC if you are in a casual guild like me and the probability of that giving you a piece you don't have of HC would be pretty low and that's what happened with uldir, at least in my guild, for the time it could give you a third piece, you should be already full geared of hc or almost. The only way this would be bad it's if it gave mythic ilvl gear.<br />
<br />
I see this with good eyes, because i'm someone who has alters and my guild, being casual and all needs the help. So we all have alters for times whe need another class, for example : I was Paladin healer but we were 15 people and had other 3 healers, I liked fury warrior so I leveled it up, used the warfronts, they rushed me the easy bosses of uldir in HC giving me whatever dropped from other plate users and I had an acceptable warrior who could rush orbs and did not have to wait until we found one, or 2 weeks until I was equipped and we could get that cutting edge.<br />
<br />
In my case at least, I'm glad every 2 weeks or so I can get an HC piece that could or could not be of use because I have alters and don't have the time to prepare them all. I have a life but I don't want to throw it because of a game.</div></div><hr />

On one hand, yeah, it's really nice way to make sure dungeons and world quests don't become useless once you've already geared up! On the other hand, such 'catch up mechanics' will make the current raid (and War Front) pointless and skippable entirely by everyone.<br />

While I do prefer a system of Dungeons &gt; Raid 1 &gt; Raid 2 &gt; etc (Or simply the M+ difficulty increase)... with the way the game is now I suppose the reward boost is welcome! \o/<br />

2) Quests. Lots of them.<br />
3) Tol Dagor Dungeon run<br />
4) Quests. More of them.<br />
5) Shrine of the Storm dungeon run. I might add throughout these dungeon runs its &quot;collect X, Kill the Last Boss&quot;<br />
6) MORE Quests.<br />
7) Waycrest Manor Dungeon Run. By this point I was about to quit when I did this shit.<br />

9) And now for something completely different... MYTHIC Siege of Boralus. Unless they added Heroic SoB, I don't know. Can't remember.<br />

I agree, try to think that those 11 weeks will be to fill the BIS that scaped your luck, or I hope it works like that.<br />

What blizzard should do with azerite, is that the ones who come from M+ gives an amazing trait only for M+ and the same with raiding and PVP. It's only 3 pieces so a PVP player could still raid or do M+ but they would not be as good as someone who has spent time and effort doing it, same for the other 2.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MasterHamster</div><div class="date">2019-01-15, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Difficulty of &quot;base&quot; content shouldn't have to increase between &quot;seasons&quot;... though of course I would welcome Heroic dungeons and other non-raid content not being laughably easy the moment you hit 120 in 8.0. I'd argue that a 30% overall increase is what the dungeons should've been in 8.0 from the go. Then again, rewards also change, even further screwing up the reward curve. <br />
Scaling content is fine, and this is clearly at least partially tied to how quickly the game throws free gear at you, but come on. The difficulty curve outside of raids is nonexistent. <br />
<br />
I mean, will we see dungeons become even more difficult in the third season of BFA? As in, it's being scaled afterwards to &quot;keep up&quot; with players, being a bandaid fix trying to cut back just how brainless easy things become so quickly.<br />
<br />
The whole issue is that there is no natural curve outside of progression raiding, the fix shouldn't be to increase base difficulty in waves through.<br />
<br />
Heroic dungeons shouldn't just be somewhat decently balanced for 2 days before it becomes a faceroll AoE-fest, we players get showered in gear too quickly, there's zero sense of going into gear appropriate content, having it feel challenging, and as you slowly acquire gear it gets easier and easier, which is satisfying. Instead pretty much everything outside of progression raiding feels like you've won the moment you managed to get a tank and healer in the group.<br />
<br />
Hopefully these kind of &quot;rolling&quot; itemlevel and difficulty level changes are nothing but a necessary evil, and Blizzard has realized at last what happens when all sort of basic challenge is removed from non-raid content, and in the next expansion they don't have to do things like &quot;making heroic/mythic dungeons 30% more dangerous&quot; just because players are outgearing EVERYTHING in 24h played.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorca</div><div class="date">2019-01-15, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, it is said that you need those three achievements for unlocking the Zandalari... and we can already have two of them (I myself got two of them). Regarding to the Tides of vengeance, that achievement has 4 parts, and I already got three, being the one I don't have done the chain of quest that can be made in the PTR and which happen BEFORE the new raid. This makes me wonder: if we finish that quest, will we be able to unlock the Zandalari without making the raid (so no need to wait until the last wing of the LFR is open)?</div></div><hr />

What's with this making heroic/mythic dungeons 30% more difficult? Since when have they ever done that in an expansion that they didn't add new, harder dungeons (e.g. ZG/ZA, Hour of Twilight heroics). I don't get the point of that at all. I'm finding it harder and harder to care about this game with all these nonsensical decisions the team keeps making. Nothing is making me excited to do anything at all.<br />
<br />
To keep them &quot;relevant&quot; at least at the beginning of the patch, you will gear up and you won't do them again (they did it in legion 2 btw). if they increase the ilvl they give but they don't increase how &quot;hard&quot; it is it wouldn't make sense, that's why they don't make normal &quot;harder&quot; so you could gear up with normal and then take on HC and mythic 0 (talking about dungeons here ofc). I think it's reasonable and I actually like it.</div></div><hr />

I let my sub run out two days ago because I wanted to level an alt but don't want to waste my time while I wait for the race/class combination to be unlocked. It's a really shitty MAU strategy<br />

Yeah nothing wrong with that kind of curve or anything. :rolleyes:<br />

I mean it dropping 355 gear is fine in Darkshore. But you shouldn't get a fucking Heroic Dazar'alor piece from something that's easier than LFR or even a Heroic Dungeon.<br />
<br />
In 8.1.5, Azerite armor will become the primary source of strength to players. Not item level anymore. We will have 2 Azerite traits per armor, people who raid/mythic+ the most will certainly have better traits and will deal significantly more damage.</div></div><hr />

Before the expansion came out they said that they wouldn't be on 8.0, so the people you are talking about should have unsubbed until they heard of a hard date, saying they won't come out with 8.0 is not beating around the bush.</div></div><hr />

Misleading actually, is putting zandalari as they did when they announced the expansion and not saying anything, now that is misleading.<br />
They said months before the expansion (I think it was months before, but I'm sure at least a month) that the zandalari would not come out in 8.0.<br />
<br />
They did mislead us when they announced the expansion (they neither confirmed they would be at the start of it when they announced the expansion tho...), but then corrected it, with enough time for people to buy the expansion if they wanted.<br />
<br />
If you want to throw shit, do it with something like, azerite armor or islands expeditions, you are just venting your anger in something they did not do bad or good.</div></div><hr />

They are a seasoned company that have made games for years, they are well aware of their timelines and when content needs to be released. They need to be truthful so that player expectations can be gauged and it would reduce headache in the long run. We live in a social media world now and they need to adapt to that or don't talk to us at all, they cannot have it both ways and cherry pick info to feed to us or backlash will continue.</div></div><hr />

But neither of those reasons applies to something like emissaries or Assaults, where you don’t see what the reward will be until the end. And as you say, it can be frustrating if it’s for a spec you have no intention of playing, or it can simply feel like a bug. So we’re changing it. is actually reassuring to the fact that they are listening, maybe not to everything, but they are - especially that last few words.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After we gained their trust? Mate we ran around and collected 1000's of x and killed 1000's of y, watched them unleash a C'thraxxi only to go in to a giant laboratory and kill a synthetic old god. How much more trust do they need?<br />
<br />
Completing Zandalar Forever should be all that is required to unlock them. Uncovering all the shit going on in Zandalar, uniting the Loa to push back the Blood Trolls, then going in to an Old God facility and defeating G'huun. <br />
<br />
You could make a case for being unlocked after G'huun in defeated and Princess Wakanda makes her speech to 5 trolls in front of the pyramid, but to drag it out till after a second raid is a bit of a joke</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marrilaife</div><div class="date">2019-01-16, 02:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">370 is the equivalent of heroic mode raiding. So why is the ilvl cap for world quest emissary only being increased to 385 aka normal mode raiding? Tbh, I'm actually positively surprised by this. <br />
<br />
I was pretty much dreading the idea people will gear up to heroic raid level through grinding emissaries / invasions. Kills any incentive to raid heroic. And majority of playerbase doesn't raid mythic. I'm glad they toned down on this shower of free epics. If people wanna get 400 ilvl, they should do m+10, raid heroic, or do whatever is the rated pvp equivalent of pve progression. If it was up to me, I wouldn't give heroic quality gear from afk-warfront and loot pinata world bosses either, ever. <br />
<br />
I'm surprised, because there were earlier screenshots from ptr provided on wowhead of random 400 azerite caches from invasions. So they did in the end change it. <br />
<br />
But while there are few things to be annoyed at (for example that warfront will award 400 item at all and the first one will go to Horde again... sigh; or that the cost of specific azerite isn't just 3x random but more like 4,5x random), the scaling down of free gear means alts and new players can still &quot;catch up&quot; to the point they can enter the newest raid on normal or heroic, but it won't replace running raids or mid-level keystones as a primary source of end game gear.</div></div><hr />

Questing to reach max level, quest a bit more and then world quests topped with some more world quests to get emissaries and waiting on the rep to slowly build. <br />

Sounds exactly like what I was doing on Horde side. I'd rather grind rep by killing mobs, at least then I could manage the time table myself.<br />

I agree with you actually, but blizzard has never been perfect and will never be. The fact that people don't remember that blizzard from day one has released patches and not shared every change and think it's something that it's happening only now speaks for itself. Same people (I don't know if you) that are talking about the raid coming 1 month later forget that ICC from the best expansion evah was timegated.<br />

hmmm no, mobs gain is lower than yours, I think it was something on the lines like &quot;you are 30% better, mobs has 15% more health&quot; (But I don't know) meaning that you will notice this 30 ilvl bump when you do world quests for example, you will kill things faster, just not 1 shot them 6 months into the expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Amount of pieces you’d have to scrap for that:<br />
<br />
385: 205 pieces of Azerite gear<br />
400: 63 pieces of Azerite gear<br />
415: 20 pieces of Azerite gear<br />
<br />
Considering gear sources, I'd say the weekly m+ chest will be your biggest source of income by far (625 for a 10 key).<br />
Napkin math tells me that it'll take around 20-30 weeks to get enough for the 3 specific pieces you're after, call me a cynic but that sounds awfully close to the next raid tier.</div></div><hr />
