Legion - Pre-Expansion Quests<br />
Now that everyone has had a chance to read the comic, we are taking a look at some more of the pre-expansion quests. The new crystal model for Magni Bronzebeard (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/april/MagniBronzebeard_CrystaL.jpg) is used here, along with a visit to Ulduar and Karazhan. <br />

Unholy Death Knight -- Legion Beta Feedback<br />
Amidst various Unholy tuning ongoing in the upcoming build, the damage of Festering Wound is increased substantially, as is the damage of the Army of the Dead and Apocalypse ghouls (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/411795-unholy-death-knight-legion-beta-feedback/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743575959?page=12#238))<br />
<br />
Frost Death Knight -- Legion Beta Feedback<br />
Hey all. We've seen the discussion about bugs with Frost DK damage (most notably Rime proc chance), and so I wanted to stop by and let you know that we are aware and fixing several bugs with Frost DK damage over the next build or two.<br />
<br />
Rime had 3 chances to proc per Obliterate, several new abilities only used your base 5% crit chance, and the Ambidexterity artifact trait was affecting MH damage, among a few other minor bugfixes. Sindragosa's Fury is also getting a tiny buff. These fixes will obviously affect throughput, and we'll be adjusting tuning with them in mind. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/411738-frost-death-knight-legion-beta-feedback/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743646087?page=20#393))<br />

I really hate momentum (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/206476-momentum), can't you just remove it? feels clunky and not fun<br />
If we removed everything that someone didn't like, there'd be no game. We can make competitive alternatives instead. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/746161026119442432))<br />

I've become very attached to the old pet model, and whilst I like the new one, it's not my old pal. The pic is Live vs PTR.<br />
Good news! All of the old models will be available on various rare spawns in the world, you will be able to re-create Sooty. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/743882926975115264))<br />
<br />
Mounts<br />
Legion brings so many great mount models, but many aren't available to players. Please don't forget them!<br />
Trying to add more different mount styles instead of making all of the colors available to keep them feeling more special/unique (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/746397572843995138))<br />
Much feedback in Warlords that too many recolors were used, agreedo (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/746397870765400068))<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
are you working on archaeology on beta #legion? If so, is it intended to get suramar dig sites prior to hitting 110?<br />
I am not, but my sources tell me that it is intended, and intended to be difficult if you head there while levelling (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/744932940308692992))<br />
<br />
I didnt attempt the dig sites in Suramar, they just changed on their own. That supposed to happen? Daily rotation?<br />
Yep! Like world quests, they rotate. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/745287743626838016))<br />
<br />
Camera<br />
Understand your view on the camera, but can CVar still be available to adding? DynamicCam has made levelling in beta so great!<br />
Will look into that; the intent was to cap the value, not eliminate interaction with it. Agree that DynamicCam is a cool addon. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/746821934646595584))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
does the Mad Merchant spawn in random places? Want to buy it on beta to see it in game to see if I want to buy it when live<br />
One spot, but shows up rarely (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/746403115369365504))<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
.D'ya think the WoW's success ultimately hurt the genre? Can't blame y'all for dominating but I wonder where we would be now?<br />
It probably made it harder for other games to innovate because their publishers might be leery of making something too different. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/743931249278889984))<br />
But smart people ultimately realize that games are never dethroned by exact clones. MMOs should be innovating more IMO. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/743931494960234496))<br />

<br />
Yep, I keep wondering if they can't just use something like void storage for it, now that pets don't really have unique traits within the same tamed pet npc. I mean, stable essentially is similiar in the interface layoutwise, but I don't know if they can use something that is as resourcefriendly as it. As I understand it, it was why the stable was so tricky in the past - a database hog.</div></div><hr />

Nope, didnt get anything.<br />
Created a new lvl100 Toon on the PTR, and logged into Stormwind. Got no Khadgar, or no quest indicating otherwise.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Queen of Hamsters</div><div class="date">2016-07-04, 10:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">...The negative feedback concerning mounts wasn't &quot;there are too many cool mounts available through recolors&quot;... The problem people had with how mounts were handled in WoD, was that the COOL ones that made sense as in-game rewards were put up onto the store whilst in-game factions and mobs just had elekks, riverbeasts, boars, talbuks and &quot;wolves&quot; (worgs technically, given how they run)... in some cases it didn't even make sense, such as laughing skull offering a shitty wolf recolor instead of at least an equivalent to the Alliance mount (armored elekk)...they didn't even have the motivation to turn the Iron Horde wolf into a player mount. <br />
<br />
I'm sure people would have been fine with recolors if those recolors had been Rylaks, Reavers, fairie dragons, runesabers... Why they didn't make the Mystic Runesaber a reward from the &quot;Legendary&quot; questline when they knew how people felt about the expac is proof just how out of touch they've become. Not until it was time for the Moose did they reconsider.<br />
<br />
Now they'll make a 180, true to Blizzard form, and make too few mounts I'm willing to bet.</div></div><hr />

go to Dalaran, Violet citadel, ground floor, speak to the archivist, she'll allow you to do the quest.<br />

Oh, I don't know about the pre-patch content. It works fine on beta though.<br />
I -think- this quest will be available on the pre-patch since they start right after you do the broken shore hing (which is supposed to come with 7.0?) but may not be available on the regular prt.</div></div><hr />

Don't blame people for whining about something that was (is) a legitimate problem at the time. No one had any issue with re-colours being offered anyway, re-colours have been offered since vanilla. The problem was a lack of variety, only recolours were offered. Now Blizz are listening in their usual 'half-listening' way and doing the opposite extreme, don't blame the playerbase for that, blame Blizz for ignoring the core issue (again).</div></div><hr />

I blame players for the way they whine. &quot;Oh look another recolor&quot; is the extent of most of the comments. VERY few people bothered to elaborate beyond that. Reality is that WoD had about the same amount of models of every other expac. Pigs, Elephants, Rhinos, Hippos, &amp; wolves just wasn't a variety that many found enjoyment in. But, most of the complaints didn't saying anything other than &quot;Oh look another recolor&quot;, so technically Blizz is just following what the majority complained about.</div></div><hr />
