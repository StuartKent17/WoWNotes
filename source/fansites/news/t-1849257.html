Also, I find it funny that I heard and saw more of Lore when he worked for free on TankSpot in his spare time than when he's getting paid 6 figures at Blizzard to literally just post on forums and interact with the community.

No, it had potential for a great story, but you idiots fucked it up by rushing through it in the end game. Nerzul in shadowmoon was great.... we killed him in an instances. Kargath look fierce in Spires, he became a 1st boss Epic welfare boss. We didn't even fight Grom. the only thing good is the raids, but story telling was crap. They should change it to &quot;&quot;Warlords of Draenor had a good hype story,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Legion could launch before or after the Warcraft movie and the expansion release date isn't tied to it.&quot;<br />

So what your telling us is &quot;Faster expansion, less patches, and the same 1 year of final raid tier&quot;?</div></div><hr />

I can't honestly see them releasing this after the movie, I don't think they want another SoO situation. I mean if they do or not it will hurt them more than anything, i don't care how much i love this game im not staying subbed for another year of the same content :(....my guess though for release is gonna be end winter/beginning spring. so like april sometime is my guess..with people getting test invite after blizzcon...just my speculation :D probably completely wrong, but its a fair timeline that i think would make sense more than waiting for the movie</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;I love&quot; how people have no memory of Blizzard's 100% track record every time they have mentioned a time table about an expansion's release.<br />
<br />
It is ALWAYS later than sooner. We have never once been surprised once by an early expansion launch- ever.<br />
<br />
It is better that it is more polished and ready, so I can wait.<br />
<br />
But they are right. They need to shut up with their year in/year out hyping of time tables and content before they have any freaking idea of what they are talking about.<br />
<br />
Why on earth do you feel the need to tell us it is not tied to the movie? People know this.<br />
<br />
People are rightfully frustrated that it looks like this last tier of the Steam Early Access Expansion will be ONE YEAR LONG... again. In spite of the library of quotes and walls of blue texts from the past few years that state otherwise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
^ All this means is that they are not willing to share anything with us as of yet.<br />
<br />
Blizzard learned a very big lesson with WoD and one i bet they are not willing to repeat. Beta will happen before Blizzcon, this I'm pretty sure on. If Beta was going to be after Blizzcon you would think that Legion would of been announced at Blizzcon instead of before hand. <br />
<br />
Looking like a Late Aug / Sep for beta imo, since Internal Alpha is in progress. <br />
&quot;Internal Alpha&quot; could also mean that F&amp;F Alpha is all ready running and that beta is just around the corner, which was hinted from someone at Blizzard on Twitter last week.( The twitter post hinted that beta will start &quot;very soon&quot; The thing is that we don't know if it's the Blizzards &quot;Soon&quot; or just a normal very soon and actually meaning in the next month or so )</div></div><hr />

This just in, wow team has added 1000 more people;) You know, faster one year expansions. Well it is not actually one year expansion. More like 18-19 months. Well content is not exactly 50% of 2 year expansion. More like 25%. But read the good news about adding more staff and moose mount in store. <br />
<br />
Can't wait for sub numbers before Legion launches, if anyone is still playing by then!<br />

TLDR: We never actually planned to have flight in this expansion, thought it would be easy to impliment, and then crapped ourselves when we discovered we painted ourselves into a corner.<br />

Except for things to do in MoP. There is literally nothing to do in WoD once raiding is done. I can see disastrous sub numbers for next 3 quarters.</div></div><hr />

what drama ? anyone who is even a bit sane is prepared that this tier wil last for 12-14 months with maybe longer 7.0 pre launch event to cover for fact that there is no content whatsoever to do<br />

what the hell are you talking about? There are numerous means of traveling in the &quot;Z&quot; direction in warlords. Feather, gliders, etc. Obviously the only thing we can learn from this is that there are ZERO players who understand how flying works in world of warcraft and all estimates (easy, hard, them, ours) were incorrect.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Because we knew it wouldn't, and it hasn't. None of the other content in 6.2.1/6.2.2 has delayed flying in any way.&quot; So that means they knew that they will not give our free-flying back. So they lied into our face again and again...</div></div><hr />

If they do that, assuming they actually design the world with flight in mind and it works at that time, they won't be able to mess it all up with all the patches and hotfixes later and then have to do a lot of rework. Since we know they will have flying at some point in Legion it would be more efficient and economical to just have it available in 7.0.</div></div><hr />

I seriously don't understand how they expect millions of people to carry on paying subs for content that has no end in sight and no idea of when the next expansion is due. And the content that they have provided in 6.2 is old already and a lot of people have already completed it. This is not good value for money. In my guild alone most people only log in for raids. There are going to be a lot of angry people out there. <br />
<br />
And those that are saying it won't be after the movie, surly Blizzard would know that and say it would be before the movie. Its 10 months away how can they not know how long they have for development?????<br />

You cannot reason with people who &quot;just know better&quot;, no arguments will change their minds as they are set on that Blizz is bad and that it only destroys fans favourite game. I try hard to think of any other game that lived 10 years with millions of fans who were playing it on daily (or monthly) basis, that had so many expansions and yet works quite well, and I cannot think of any. I don't mind that people became critic, that it is not any more just about the hype as even I noticed that every expansion is pretty much &quot;copy and paste&quot; of old ideas just with another theme and easier mobs. Yet it is hard to call for freshness and originality when game is that old and contains so much content already. I don't like when people just argue and attack Blizzard like some emotional babies that simply can't take argument and will keep pointing with finger and try shout you to death no matter what you say. <br />
<br />
It is just a game and in any other game people accept that game developers do things as they please, change game in mid of what they are advertising, that they don't follow fan wishes even though sometimes they may be nice to fans. In Wow fans become quasi developers over years and demand that their ideas are applied no matter if they are reasonable or not. Just so you know, you pay for every single game you play and paying monthly fee does entitle you to play, not to actively decide future of the game. It is just stupid when people complain because developers said something and didn't do it later. I mean they don't swear oath to you, they usually speak of more or less certain things, those aren't craved in stone. Somehow in real life you understand when people promise or just say and then can't deliver or change mind but when it comes to Wow then you will take every word they say as if it were in court. <br />
<br />
I have been playing Wow so long and before people commented on new things speaking of what they expect, asking devs for more information, speculating. Now people just whine on every word and treat everything that devs say like a big lie, like if something must be fishy. Before fans were encouraging, devoted, cheering and now they became nagging like old ladies. It is just sad.</div></div><hr />

If they do that, assuming they actually design the world with flight in mind and it works at that time, they won't be able to mess it all up with all the patches and hotfixes later and then have to do a lot of rework. Since we know they will have flying at some point in Legion it would be more efficient and economical to just have it available in 7.0.<br />
<br />
That's exactly what I was thinking last night. If delaying or implementing no flight leads to them breaking aspects of the game to keep it in check then surely wouldn't it be more sensible to just have the implementation there and ready to be earned and unlocked at level cap at launch? I mean even No Flight Players must realise if they don't have to mess about with undoing and fixing the damage done by temporary bandage fixes to delay flight then they can spend that additional time on working on more content and balancing which is their other biggest complaints?</div></div><hr />

5 million players, at 15euros per month, 75Million euro revenue per month. Surely you can afford some good devs at that price ? <br />

Oh yeah, &quot;you can only recruit devs that adhere to the right frame of thinking and fit with the organisation&quot;. That's a handy pushback to justify why you only have 10-20 devs for a 5M player game.</div></div><hr />

Dear lord I fear that they actually believe themselves. WoD's story was complete shit, I could say it had potential yet no story other than building up Gul'dan was any good. A lot of scrapped pieces like Doomhammer and Kargath, and having a zone like Gorgrond having no real story at all because the botani weren't even supposed to be there.

Hardly a conspiracy theory, this is just poor business planning, one would have thought Blizzard would have learned from MoP.

As a software developer/project manager I can only agree to this. I've already realised though that trying to explain on the internet doesn't work.<br />
People don't understand software development and everything that goes along with it. <br />
Even if a bug fix takes 1 line of code an is done in 10 minutes of programming, that is nowhere near the time you need to invest to get it live (reviews, tests, go/no-go's, patch structure, actual rolling out, ...) which is what most people tend to oversee.<br />

So, now we know why they told the investors to expect cyclical subs - the players have *no other choice*. Once you finish HFC, you're done - you have nothing ti do until June, 2016. <br />
<br />
What brainiac in Irvine looked at the patch release schedule, saw that it was all front loaded into the first 1/3 of the lifespan of the expansion, and okayed it? Is this a serious, intentional thing? Where's the content, devs? You took more time developing this than any expansion, you made SoO an unmitigated disaster being there for 14 months, and you turn around and do this? And you're blaming the sub drop on &quot;cyclical&quot; subs? I'm vindicated for walking away from your train wreck of a game every time you open your mouths! <br />
<br />
And, the story in WOD was a disgrace, that you should be ashamed of. But, it vindicates yet another aspect of the game some of us have been criticizing since it came out - we're not just crying for the sake of crying, White Knights - your M'Lady devs even admit it was flawed. <br />
<br />
I'm betting Lore is gone by the time Legion ships, if he has a scrap of conscience left under that poodle perm. But seriously, dude - you took *2 hours* to write that? And your boss is okay with that? It accomplished nothing. And now you're on the pity pot crying about mean posters? Grow a fucking pair, dude! Put on the big boy pants - you knew what the job involved when you took it. <br />
<br />
I think I see a new wrinkle in what's rotten in Irvine. If a lower level CM can blow two hours of a working day on a meaningless wall of text like that, they need to supervise their workers a little closer, and give them guidance on how to prioritize tasks. 2 hours, for that. That's unacceptable. Is that how things work down there? Is that why things take Blizzard FOREVER to get done? Because people are just wandering around doing whatever the hell they want, blowing half an afternoon on meaningless twaddle? <br />
<br />
Seriously, I should try to get a job there - you can't get fired, and you can spend a full quarter of the working day writing up a long, anguished &quot;programming is HARD&quot; post. Sounds like easy money to me.<br />

Oh, wait, I have a conscience and a work ethic. <br />

<br />
This basically means, that they don't confirm anything. Stop making conspiracy theories.<br />
<br />
Why did they even brought up this? Before their answer was a sure thing they have to release before the movie (if they didn't lie again about the fast releases).<br />
This is how they soften up you... it is Pure PR crap. I will buy a WoD part 2 copy for all of you if they release it before the movie. Cut out this sentence, save it, pin it! I would like to see your burning faces when you will see this comment again after the movie.<br />

You might be more correct than incorrect in some of your factual assertions and certainly no one can tell you if you should feel good about no longer being subscribed or not but you could be less of an asshole about it.

They aren't personally trying to screw you over so the hostility and fake incredulity is really unnecessary, especially if you've already unsubscribed (and yet, come here to write 1000 word essays about the game). <br />

You are 100% incorrect about the time spent writing that post being wasted or a sign of him goofing off though. They have to try and address people's (bullshit) concerns about the flying taking 10 weeks instead of 8 or less and people are in desperate need of a reality check. Anyone who's ever written an email designed to go out to the whole company, or to the press, or to players knows that it can take a long time to get the wording right, especially if the topic is controversial. <br />

You couldn't be more tiresome if you tried. I've written pages and pages of critical commentary and unfulfilled feature requests over the decade that I've been playing World of Warcraft and unsubscribed twice because the game wasn't working for me at the time. I've never felt the need to be as big of a chore about it as you though. <br />
<br />
Focus on the things they could be doing better and less on the personal attacks on the developers and maybe try working on some basic empathy skills.<br />

I understand where they are coming from. I know some of you don't care either way, but I care. I will continue to be a subscriber. I play casually enough that I have plenty of things to do on my characters until Legion. PLUS, don't forget, they said that there would be pre-expansion events. There is that to look forward as well!<br />
<br />
I personally don't care about being able to fly. I'm really indifferent about it. I don't really have a reason to fly in Draenor yet anyway. <br />
<br />
It's interesting though, that people who are unsubscribed come back to complain...yet people like myself are in the game having a fun time. I don't normally post a lot anymore...but I felt like I needed to chime and let someone out there know that not everyone is pissed off.<br />
<br />
I really respect Blizzard, and their employees. Developers work hard. Programming is challenging and ANYTHING can go wrong. ANYTHING. I actually specialize in &quot;production support&quot;...it's stressful when things go wrong...and they will go wrong. The more we degrade developers, the worst they will code. I know that's how it works for me. <br />
<br />
Anyway, they will continue to receive my support. GO GO BLIZZARD GO!<br />

You can't make a baby faster by getting 9 women pregnant and you can't make a game twice as fast by doubling the amount of staff. You just cant. Remember how hard it was to coordinate a 40 man raid vs 25? It's just like that. You need more supervisors, more guidance, more checks and QA to make sure that everyone is on the same page, more meetings to schedule more projects, more desks, workstations, servers, bathrooms, parking (never understimate the cluster#$(@ that is having less parking than needed). God help you if you have to move or acquire a second building. Now you are relocating an entire company and infrastructure. <br />
<br />
Simply hiring more people is the worst thing you can do and we've already seen the issues caused by that when they doubled up on the staff before WOD.</div></div><hr />

There's more to this game than just achievements. And where did I say I had nothing to do? I just think the game is not fun at the moment. I don't raid and that's my choice because I don't want to invest that time. I made that comment because we all know Blizzard has said they don't want that long of a patch cycle before an expansion release, yet that is exactly what we'll have again.

haha how else can I show them I dont like the product they make? Sure, my money alone dont mean jackshit if only I unsubbed, but OH theres many more doing so. Instead of writing 1 million words here or on any other wow site most people unsub and thats the strongest way to say you dislike the content in wow.<br />
<br />
If raiding in wow suddenly sucked for you, you would probably unsub and many others would to.<br />
<br />
If you dislike lets say FIFA 15, would you go out and buy the product and keep spending money on it from the shop they got? Nah, you would not. And if millions of people playing FIFA did that, EAsports would react to that.<br />
<br />
Kind of like voting. Yeah, you are only 1 vote, but every vote counts.<br />

This pretty much sums it up. People need to stop living in the past, we all grew up, and we cant sink endless hours into WoW like we used to and I have plenty to do when I do play even if it mostly is raiding. I play WoW for the social aspect and the friends I have met over the years made every hour wasted worth it. My current roommate I met on WoW in 2006. We all play for our own reasons andthe sooner you realize the game will never be like it used to be the better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's impossible to state. What it means for sure is that warlords wasn't built with flying enabled. They certainly are not writing the system from scratch or anything and probably not having to spend a ton of time fixing map/texture issues since the flight points and/or feather allow players to see a very large portion of the map. <br />
<br />
The reality is we have no idea whatsoever what goes into actually enabling *flight* on the maps. From what they are saying with dismounts and such it sounds like there is some kind of flag on the terrain that has to be enabled and given how the maps are designed, the terrain could be in a thousand pieces for each zone and require someone to go in one piece at a time to turn on. That also might be completely incorrect in practice but it sounds like an apt analogy. <br />
<br />
I would have thought that given how the glider and the feather work that doing flight that it was an easy process but clearly there is more to the system of flying than simply changing the z-coordinates of your character.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, you are correct on that. We aint young anymore and cant sink endless hours into the game anymore. BUT, I have always liked the solo part in wow. Doing stuff on my own etc, while having some friends to play with. I dont raid that much anymore. TBH, LFR is just to bad to even bother. Either I raid with a team/guild or I dont.</div></div><hr />

True that. But why do they always make us have content drought between last content patch and new xpac? It has happend xpac after xpac, its nothing new. Not for them, not for us. In MoP that had good amount of content before SoO released, they screwed that up. Instead of streching the Krasarang daily storyline(quests)/pvp &amp; thunder isle a bit, they instead had those patches last a few months and have us wait 12+ months from SoO launch to WoD.</div></div><hr />

didn't they release a statement on that saying they pushed out the pandaria content too fast? yes you could literaly make a statement about anything, but with wod there was no content to begin with, so you end with a content drought of nothing more than non-content so saying that they pushed out this xpac too fast is an overstatement, i honestly believe that wod was just filler to make the story of legion flow better, this means the 14 month drought of mop to wod was bassicly them developing wod on the fly. all the others are just because they want to release a good product and not an half-arsed xpac like wod, that's why development on legion was already in progress at the end of mop.</div></div><hr />

Dont get me wrong, I rather wait long and get a great product than something thats rushed and halfway done. Probably why I have stayed sub in previous xpacs but not now.

they have said for how long they want to have yearly expacs? don't worry, there will always be a content drought, may it be a short one may it be a long one, this one is likely going to take almost a year aswell so i'm not so positive that we will get yearly expansions anytime soon.</div></div><hr />

I mean I do for things like McDonald's. But you can throw money at dev and see the problems away. You just can. All the processes you descsribed and am familiar with can reduce 5 folds if you double the worker base. Easily done with 75million revenue per month. <br />
<br />
If Activision or blizzard wants wow to work, they just have to release the content (much) faster. Which is easily done by adding resources.<br />
<br />
Anyone who honestly believes this needs to use some common sense or take a basic economics class. Money does not equate to problems solved. There's so much wrong with this illogical stance that I don't even know where to begin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tom Chilton: We don’t know. They’ve changed the date of the movie a couple of times on us. Assuming that it is when they currently have it planned, it could be anywhere in that neighborhood, it could be before or after.<br />
<br />
Ion Hazzikostas: Ultimately we’re excited about the movie ourselves. We’re fans when it comes to that and Universal are going to an awesome job with it but the release date of our game is when the time is right.<br />
<br />
This is what we are looking at. MMO Champ gave us the short version, but they really are no planning to release it until around June it seems. Tom clearly stated that he doesn't know if the two will be related.</div></div><hr />

There are some guilds called Fire Holinka, so I don't know if that had anything to do with that.<br />
<br />
Reserved names are checked at character creation, and as far as I know that's the only time it is used. Blizzard's naming policy (http://us.battle.net/support/en/article/naming-policy) covers everything after the fact. So, it is possible to create a character that works around the reserved restriction, but you'll get nailed for violating that policy if someone else reports the name. Guild names are not checked but can also be reported for any violation (obscenity/lewdness and harassment, primarily).</div></div><hr />

What it means for sure is that warlords wasn't built with flying enabled. They certainly are not writing the system from scratch or anything and probably not having to spend a ton of time fixing map/texture issues since the flight points and/or feather allow players to see a very large portion of the map. <br />
<br />
The reality is we have no idea whatsoever what goes into actually enabling *flight* on the maps. From what they are saying with dismounts and such it sounds like there is some kind of flag on the terrain that has to be enabled and given how the maps are designed, the terrain could be in a thousand pieces for each zone and require someone to go in one piece at a time to turn on. That also might be completely incorrect in practice but it sounds like an apt analogy. <br />
<br />
I would have thought that given how the glider and the feather work that doing flight that it was an easy process but clearly there is more to the system of flying than simply changing the z-coordinates of your character.<br />
<br />
now you are contradiction yourself - IF they were thinking about having flying implemented and being turned on few months after release they would have it figured out BEFORE WoD release - what they are proving now they never intended to in wod just didnt expect such a blow back and they panicked - thats why we have to wait almost 3 months after 6.2 landed.<br />
<br />

<br />
People get so angry! What happened to just playing the game and having fun?<br />
<br />
<br />
what happened ? WoD happened and suddenly 5 mln people decided during 6 months that game is simply not fun anymore due to blizzard choices.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hunters' pet names can also be &quot;reserved&quot;. I can't remember what it was now, but I once got a &quot;that name is reserved&quot; message when I tried to name a pet years ago. It wasn't offensive in any way but it was a real name of some kind. And hunter pet names are not like character names as far as having to be unique.</div></div><hr />

And where did I say I had nothing to do? I just think the game is not fun at the moment. I don't raid and that's my choice because I don't want to invest that time. I made that comment because we all know Blizzard has said they don't want that long of a patch cycle before an expansion release, yet that is exactly what we'll have again. I love World of Warcraft and I'm usually not the one to whine about the game, I hardly ever do.<br />
<br />
Look i make games for a living as well and i don't get where players get this notion that we can fart out a new game or patch in what ever time you see fit,shit takes time and hard work and needs testing and finalizing and all sorts, yet the player base thinks we press a magic button and a patch comes out....</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know it takes time and all of that. The thing is Blizzard themselves have stated they wanted to bring down the patch cycle. If they don't want people complaining about this they shouldn't have said anything to begin with if they can't do it. They could just easily come out and say &quot;look we thought we could manage it but we can't, it's just too much, we gotta focus on the development of the next expansion&quot;, instead they keep mentioning every year that they will shorten the patch cycles.</div></div><hr />

Its called marketing. Who would you rather hire between two guys, the miserable depressed looking one who says &quot;Look i can probs do this job for you but i highly doubt it,i will probably kill myself during the process&quot; Or a nice smiley guy who says &quot;Sure i can do all those things you want i will have it done as soon as possible,while im here would you like a coffee :D:D:D:D&quot; so basically they are covering their own backs and giving you something to believe in.</div></div><hr />

On the front page no less? I mean it makes no effort to suggest that it is possible to meet other players in the World of Warcraft without negative aspects and rather just stands to make fun of the whole player base. Terrible video.</div></div><hr />
