Resilience Changes in 3.2<br />
Just to clarify, the change to resilience affects ALL player damage. This includes both normal hits and crits. We wanted to keep the proportion of damage coming from hits and crits the same and just reduce damage across the board. Crit damage is lowered twice, but will still contribute the same proportion of damage as it does today.<br />
<br />
Dots do receive a slight relative buff since they are no longer taxed more than other forms of damage. <br />
<br />
[i]In all seriousness though, I'm curious about the reasoning behind this change. You've mentioned before that you'd like to slow fights down, where players go from 1-2 global cooldowns to 3-4. Is this change an attempt to achieve that goal? <br />
That is the intent. We want to lower damage so that players don't die quite so quickly and have a chance to do something to respond. This should help lower the &quot;burst damage&quot; problem, along with some changes to specific classes. It does nothing for, or perhaps exacerbates, the &quot;burst healing&quot; problem. To attempt to counter this, we lowered the healing done by Penance and Lifebloom and hit some of the mana sustainability of Holy paladins (through Illumination) and druids (through Innervate and Improved Barkskin). Shamans were not heavily respresented in Arenas so we didn't think their healing output needed to be nerfed. It's possible healing may still be too good and that is something we'll need to keep a close eye on.<br />
<br />
We changed the way dots were affected by resilience (or to be more specific, we started treating all player damage the same way) because Shadow priests and warlocks were also not performing at the level we wanted them to see them, and obviously they do a lot of damage through dots. Dots were not lowered the way other forms of damage were lowered, so dot classes by comparison will do more damage in PvP than other forms of damage than they do today.<br />
<br />
Changing resilience to affect player damage is an attempt to make it unattractive to tanks and make it less useful for PvE in general. Note also that resilience becoming a more important stat in PvP means that damage (and to a lesser extent healing) will also likely go down, since wearing PvE gear in PvP will be even riskier.<br />
<br />
We understand this change can affect rage generation. We have found however that rage is a notoriously difficult number to predict based on math and simulations alone (that's kind of an understatement given the history of the mechanic) so we need to see some more PvP tests to know what the actual effects will be and what changes are needed.<br />
<br />
I should add that this is a pretty major change for PvP and will no doubt require additional iteration going forward. It is also not a panacea that obviates the need for additional PvP balance changes as needed. We ask that you be patient and try and direct your feedback towards constructive comments that will help improve the game. We think we can get PvP, and Arenas specifically, into a place that is more fun for everyone. <br />

Blue posts<br />
It's time for a huge wave of 3.2 related blue posts, and it's probably not the last one!<br />
Retaliation Battlegroup stability issues<br />
It appears our Database Administrator was able to find a solution to the stability issue. These realms should now be much more stable and playable. Please, continue to post any outage or disconnect, if one should occur. Thank you for your patience, while we worked to resolve this situation.

<br />
Patch 3.2 PTR Notes<br />
Well bear in mind the patch notes we've posted reflect what has been added to our internal patch 3.2 builds thus far. Some of the death knight notes have even changed since we posted them. The patch notes are far from all-inclusive at this point, and even the notes that do exist are subject to revision. <br />
<br />
We'll try to update them as often as possible to keep players informed about the latest changes. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/17900032287-ptr-320-more-dk-nerfing.html))<br />
<br />
[...] We've stated many times that compared to the prior content patch, this one would not have nearly as many class changes. More importantly, the notes we have released were done so that everyone could start taking a look at what we have planned currently, but it does not encompass the full extent of changes. So, at this point, you could either see more get added for your class, or not. But that possibility is still there and I'd hate for people to get fastened into the mindset that this is &quot;it&quot; for all of the notes. We have tried to make them as complete as possible up to this point but we have yet to go into the PTR and start looking at the actual testing and no one should expect this to be a simple one week of testing and then live.<br />
<br />
Make no mistakes, this patch has a lot of content in it, whether it's content you want or like is debatable, but it's nothing to sneeze at. We're going to be keeping a close eye on a variety of things and we will be continuing to look for constructive feedback as we always do.<br />
<br />
Not everyone is going to have the same amount of changes and not everyone should expect that. I know you want to see more, and that's fine, but these sorts of posts don't add to the discussion very well. I don't see warriors as &quot;fail&quot; nor do many others. If there is something you think can be improved upon though, talk about it, include details and let other players help you hash out whether you're on the right trail or if you've gone off it. It gives us a better understanding of the overall feedback being provided. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/17900031764-32-means-nothing-for-warriors-again.html))<br />
<br />
Flying in Azeroth<br />
Flying in Azeroth would be pretty awesome. There are almost limitless amounts of features we'd like to add to the game, and flying in the old world is certainly one of them. It all comes down to prioritizing as best as possible to keep the game appealing to as broad a population as possible. We try to keep all sub-communities and play styles in mind whenever working on content, and we're always looking at the big picture. Features being added in the next patch are features that were planned and in production months ago, just as features coming further down the road are in development right now. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/17899682265-why-wont-blizzard-finish-azeroth.html))<br />
<br />
[...] The old world was not designed to support flying (this is a technical issue currently, not an unwillingness to allow this on our part) and by having the level requirement for flying, it allows us to set a pace at which we feel content should be accessed. As you can see by the recent mount changes, this could be readdressed at a future point in time. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/17899691604-flying-mounts-in-old-azeroth.html))<br />
<br />
[color=#90FF53]Player vs. Player<br />
XP rewards in Battlegrounds<br />
We do want players to focus on the objectives of each individual Battleground. By offering experience for completing the objectives necessary to win a game, we effectively incentivize the need for a team to focus on strategy. If experience was based on honorable kills alone, corpse camping out in the world would only become a bigger issue, and players in Battlegrounds would be encouraged to farm kills and drag out matches as long as possible, whereas we've made adjustments to several Battlegrounds to shorten the length of each match. <br />
<br />
[...] The theory really isn't different from obtaining honor in Battlegrounds. Farming kills is ultimately not as efficient as winning a match as quickly as possible and re-queuing. Perhaps there will be Battlegrounds in the future where the objective focus is more based on slaying your opponents, and that alone; but the Battlegrounds we currently have available involve strategies where you kill who you need to in order to capture a flag or hold a capture point. Awarding experience for each kill will take away from the focus of the match.<br />
<br />
With all of this being said, please keep in mind the system is very new and hasn't been tried out by the community yet. All of the details of the PvP experience system are subject to revision once we see it in motion. Our current feeling though is that awarding experience just for farming kills in Battlegrounds detracts from the objectives of each Battleground, or the need to actually win.

Raids &amp; Dungeons<br />
4 Different Lockouts in Crusader's Coliseum<br />
Firstly, the Crusaders' Coliseum is quite a bit different from Ulduar. Beyond that though, we want raiders to have more options for approaching content. Sometimes it can be a bit daunting to decide as a group, &quot;do we want to try these hard modes and risk a long night of little progress, or just push through on normal mode?&quot; Whatever choice you make pretty much decides your progression for the week.<br />
<br />
Now, you can take a night and go through 10 or 25-player versions of the Crusaders' Coliseum without worrying about having to decide whether or not to attempt the hard mode on a particular boss. Instead a separate 10 or 25-player raid can be scheduled where the sole focus can be on Heroic mode.<br />
<br />
Before the raid even begins you can choose your difficulty, and choosing one difficulty won't mean you're shut out from attempting the alternative difficulty that same week, just as 10 and 25-player modes have been on separate lock-outs in Naxxramas and Ulduar. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/17900052145-the-point-of-4-lockouts.html))<br />
<br />
Additional instances cannot be launched!<br />
We do have plans to address this, but it requires hardware infrastructure maintenance and reorganization which can take some time to prepare and implement for all realms and battlegroups. We are working to address the situation as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
On a side note, your concern is perfectly legitimate. There was no need to bring up forum moderation regarding another player's account, as that is a violation of the Code of Conduct. Raising a concern on the forums requires only that one comes here and discusses it in a civil fashion, not spam us out of frustration, then send in one's friend to repost on one's behalf in only a slightly more reasonable fashion.

1H Weapons drops in raids<br />
We have trouble dropping one-handed weapons in raids because there is so little overlap among the classes. Shamans can't use swords. Rogues can't (currently) use axes. DKs can't use fists. That means just about everyone gets maces.<br />
<br />
We took an informal vote and everyone here thought shamans with swords went against a lot of the traditions of the class in the lore, and DKs with fists was kind of weird too. Rogues seemed like the class that would pretty much pick up any weapon in a fight -- they use a broken bottle in at least one notorious case.

Frost Dual-Wield in 3.2<br />
We're already trying to have Blood, Frost and Unholy tanks and Blood, Frost and Unholy PvP builds. Also having Blood, Frost and Unholy dual-wield builds just creates an impossible matrix. You have to support Blood 2H PvP, and Unholy DW tanking, and Frost 2H PvE. It just gets crazy.<br />
<br />
Frost might still do okay with 2H. We didn't specifically nerf their 2H abilities. We just gave them a talent to make DW more viable. I don't honestly know how 2H Frost dps stacks up in 3.2 at the moment. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/17899681368-why-are-you-forcing-frost-to-dual-wield.html))<br />

Moonkins in 3.2<br />
I wanted to correct a few misperceptions.<br />
<br />
Owlkin Frenzy is caused by all types of damage, not just physical. We were considering making that change a few patches ago (3.1?) but ended up not doing it.<br />
<br />
The resilience change does nothing to the relative damage caused by crits and non-crits. If you are a crit-dependent class, this change does absolutely nothing different for you. If 40% of your damage came from crits before, 40% of your damage will still come from crits. The only way I can imagine it having an effect is promoting more players to wear resilience which makes you less likely to crit. However the same phenomenon will also cause you to live longer.<br />
<br />
The spell miss chance was very RNG, which was frustrating for both the druid and casters attempting to get binary spells off. Changing it to spell damage will also include melee attacks from DKs and paladins that struck for Holy and Shadow damage, for which the Moonkin's prodigious armor did nothing.<br />
<br />
We realize the Lifebloom nerf does hit Balance druids too, but unlike critical damage above the resilience change does affect the relative power of healing -- it buffed it. Consider that it is harder to cause damage to someone in PvP now but no harder to heal it. As such, the LB nerf will either not be felt at all or will be a slight buff relative to the amount of damage you take. At full resilience, you are going to take ~12% less damage in PvP. That's a lot. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17899770675-new-moonkin-thread-original-post.html))<br />

Mage Q&amp;A Feedback<br />
We knew that some players would approach the Q&amp;As as a list of buffs for their class, and thus be disappointed. But that was never the intent, and we already have channels to do that. The Q&amp;As were to address the kinds of questions we get all the time, such as &quot;What do you guys see as the role of the mage class?&quot; You can find a question like that about every day. I used to answer them, but then someone would ask it again the next week without looking to even see if there had been a previous answer. As such, the Q&amp;As were designed to be more philosophical and long-term. We knew many of them wouldn't be up until after the patch notes for instance.<br />
<br />
Given the huge numbers of questions that were asked, we knew it would be impossible to pick the set that would please everyone so we did the best we could. Just because the question wasn't of interest to you doesn't mean it wasn't of interest to someone or they wouldn't have asked it. But we would like to keep the series going long-term, so there is a chance that a question that didn't come up this time can come up again.<br />
<br />
I'll just touch on two common themes:<br />
<br />
We think mage PvE damage is fine. If you are routinely getting trounced by bad players in your raid, you might consider trying to figure out how some mages are getting really good numbers.<br />
<br />
Some players have apparently misinterpreted my comments about mana. I was trying to say that the goal is that dps casters generally should not run out of mana, provided they aren't in over their heads and make reasonable use of their tools. We don't think those tools were adequate. However, we also didn't want to turn Evocate into Innervate, as is commonly asked. Instead, we went with the Ignite change (though I suspect the number will end up being something closer to 2% instead of 1% when all is said and done). We just thought it was a more interesting mechanic and felt mage-like. Since Arcane mages don't use Ignite, we dropped the Arcane Blast cost. Frost has some PvE damage problems, but Frostbolt is already a really efficient spell -- that isn't their big issue. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17900021352-the-mage-qa-responses.html))<br />
<br />
Developers Q&amp;A (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17899801584-the-real-top-mage-questions.html))<br />
Mages in general are not pleased with the seeming lack of control on their damage output. This is most noticeable in the case of fire mages. A complete dependence on RNG-based procs combined with a lack of worthwhile cooldowns leads to a &quot;spray-and-pray&quot; approach to casting. When can mages expect more control on their output? <br />
I think this phenomenon is overstated. The reason I say that is I know of mages who consistently outperform other mages with very similar gear (even within the same raid, when presumably buffs and leadership are constant). You could argue that the random numbers just always line up for them every time, but I don’t find that argument compelling. <br />
<br />
The patch notes you have released show a combination of factors that will reduce mana availability to mages. This tells us that you feel that mages currently raiding Ulduar have a surplus of mana. Is this the case? If not, are we going to see more steps taken before 3.2 releases to provide additional mana resources?<br />
I worded that answer poorly. The point I was trying to make is that our design is on challenging encounters the risk for healers running OOM should be much worse than casters running OOM. We want mages to use gems and Evocate, but if they do so reasonably well, then they should be fine on mana until the fights go for more than say 10 minutes. However, we don’t think the mage mana regen mechanics were cutting it, which is why we implemented the new mana return on Ignite. I think the patch notes said the return was 1%, but 2% might be more appropriate. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17899801584-the-real-top-mage-questions.html))<br />
<br />
Mages feel that Mana Gems and Healthstones should not share a cooldown as we are the only class in the game currently forced to choose on this matter (and with the apparent intent of our mana regen mechanics, it is not a choice at all.) When can we expect these to be unlinked?<br />
We will try to get them unlinked. I can’t recall if this was done for reasons of balance or kit, but it seems unnecessary. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17899801584-the-real-top-mage-questions.html))<br />
<br />
Mage AoE is limited by the ground-area focus and significant mana cost associated with their AoE Spells. Other classes have more flexible AoE with significantly better at-will resource regeneration (i.e. Life Tap, AotV). This causes mages to be excluded from planning for AoE phases when possible and causes the need to drink constantly on trash packs. The feeling amongst some mages is that our AoE spells should be reasonably costed but with damage balanced to the point that with few targets (say, less than 3) they are impractical due to low damage, but scale better with more targets. This would be as opposed to making them overly costly mana-wise which makes them all but unusable now. Is this something that we could reasonably see happen? <br />
I really don’t see situations where mages are not taken seriously as AE classes. Yes, some classes have higher burst AE on some trash packs. Mages still do great with Blizzard, and with the Ignite change we might even see a return of Flamestrike on some pulls. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17899801584-the-real-top-mage-questions.html))<br />
<br />
You suggest that Spell Steal could be improved with a glyph. Many mages feel that we have too many mandatory major glyphs at this point and too few useful minor glyphs. Is there any chance in this expansion of us seeing the Spell Steal as a minor glyph, or other minor glyphs in general that could provide some enhancement to the class? <br />
I was throwing that out there as a possible experiment. We intended Spell Steal to be a way to get a useful buff from an enemy. In practice it has become more of a generic dispel. Changing that could be both a buff or a nerf to mages depending on the situation. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17899801584-the-real-top-mage-questions.html))<br />
<br />
Q7: Torment the Weak is considered so mandatory by both Frost and Fire players that virtually every serious raiding mage in those specs has 18 points in Arcane despite having to waste points in the lower tiers for talents that have absolutely no benefit (not bad talents, just not relevant in any way to Frost or Fire). Additionally, on fights where we are forced to target non-snared mobs (think Kologarns arms), mages dps suffers heavily. The last time we saw a talent this mandatory was with Evocation. If mage dps is so dependant upon this talent, shouldn't we be expecting for it to be removed entirely, mage baseline dps improved, and the lower tiers of arcane spruced up with some more inviting talents?<br />
It’s hard to persuade us that mandatory talents are a bad thing. The alternative is that talent specs aren’t compelling because you could throw darts at your trees and have a viable spec. Furthermore, once you chill out a mandatory talent, then the next most powerful one is considered mandatory. I can’t think of a single talent tree for any class without a mandatory talent. It only becomes a problem when the character is severely restricted in being able to get fun utility talents because so many talents are tied up in the mandatory ones. But even in this situation I doubt mages are alone. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17899801584-the-real-top-mage-questions.html))<br />
<br />
Q8: You have told us that &quot;Arcane is a little bloated.&quot; But unlike with Shaman, you've provided little explanation as to what you would like to see happen with this tree to correct some of the bloat. Can you give us examples of some of the changes we could expect to see? <br />
I am reluctant to do this because then if the changes did not materialize in the next patch, Arcane mages might be upset. In the Q&amp;A I believe I mentioned Prot warrior and Ret paladin of models of how we would like to see all of the talent trees – very thin with an almost inability to spend all of your points in one tree. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17899801584-the-real-top-mage-questions.html))<br />
<br />
You seem to insinuate that Mirror Image actually reduces threat when all current data shows it as nothing more than a fade. If Mirror Image actually reduced threat generated while active, it would be a vast improvement. Can we ever expect to see this functionality? Can we ever expect it to come back off the GCD? <br />
Mirror Image divides your threat among the images. I thought this was well known unless I am misunderstanding the question. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17899801584-the-real-top-mage-questions.html))<br />
<br />
If you are going to continue to have longer fights, why do mana gems have charges? Really. <br />
You are supposed to have to manage your mana. You are not supposed to routinely run out. As an example of this if you are in a very short fight (like a hard mod with a fast burn) you should pull out all the stops. If you know the fight is going to go long, you should pace yourself. I would consider a mage who always did the same things in every given fight to not know their class mechanics as well as they could. Realistically, we have very few ten minute fights, and most are far shorter. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17899801584-the-real-top-mage-questions.html))<br />
<br />
Playing with Fire has always been a neat flavorful talent. But with the sorts of AoE damage flying around nowadays, it is starting to feel like too much of a liability. Why are mages unique in having a talent that actively hurts you?<br />
Kit. Homogenization is something we struggle with a lot. We don’t like it when two classes have very similar talents, though this is understandably one of the first things players suggest when they find a talent wanting. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17899801584-the-real-top-mage-questions.html))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (3.1 Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=610) / 3.1 Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?paladin))<br />
Holy changes<br />
None of the changes you mention were because of PvP balance.<br />
<br />
Many Holy paladins (on these boards even) said they were weary of only using HL spam on the tank and were willing to trade their virtually unlimited mana for the ability to contribute to raid healing in other ways. As I tried to explain in the article we posted earlier, the SS change encourages more FoL use. The Beacon change encourages you to heal targets other than the tank, while still contributing to tank healing. The Beacon change (through the HL glyph) and the SS change give paladins a little more versatility in raid healing and healing on the run. The Beacon change with a nerf to mana regen would have made paladins the strongest healer in the game by almost any estimation. We figured the regen nerf was tolerable since it never even comes into play on many fights, and you still have Divine Plea.<br />
<br />
We think healer homogenization is a very dangerous risk. We're not going to give every healer an AE heal or a hot or a shield just so they all have the same tools. We already have 5 viable healing specs for PvE, and many raids were inviting all 5. That's better than we've ever done in the history of WoW. That's not to say there weren't some problems though, which this patch hopes to address. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/17899801470-sick-of-being-designed-around-gimmicks.html))<br />
<br />
Out of curiousity, is the new FoL/SS HoT replacing the current +crit to FoL granted by SS? Or is it in addition? And does the size of the hot increase on crits? Or is it based on the non-crit spell size?<br />
The crit is on the Sacred Shield tooltip and the hot is on FoL itself, so they should both work. I didn't actually try it just now, but based on the way the spells appear to work if you crit, you crit, and the hot would be larger.<br />
<br />
Flash of Light now says &quot;Heals a friendly target for X. If the target has the Sacred Shield effect, they heal an additional 100% over 12 sec.&quot; (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/17899801470-sick-of-being-designed-around-gimmicks.html))<br />
<br />
Healing Cycle<br />
When you are deciding between high throughput or high efficiency you have a choice and the better paladins can make better choices on when to use either one. When you have one spell that is the only choice no matter what the circumstances, well that is no choice at all. We think this is a major problem with the Holy paladin spec. Many players complained about that. We’re not asking you to all agree on every change before we make them, but you also have to understand that this was something several players were asking for. We discussed our options and came up with a solution that we think makes the healing style more dynamic and interesting without fundamentally changing it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/17899801470-sick-of-being-designed-around-gimmicks.html))<br />
<br />
Holy mana regeneration<br />
What Odes said. We allowed Holy paladin regen to be very high for a long time because we thought there was an okay trade-off for being so limited in scope. We expanded the scope now. Paladins will be able to contribute a lot more (almost double in ideal cases) to non-tank healing. I understand some of you are saying you did run OOM. It’s hard for us to balance around the experience of every single player. In the end we have to try and follow trends and what we are seeing in the data. Paladin mana pools were large, which exacerbated percent mana restores, and Illumination allowed HL to never be a choice and by contrast every other heal to feel paltry by decision. If down-ranking existed in the game right now, you would never need to do it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/17899801470-sick-of-being-designed-around-gimmicks.html))<br />
<br />
/cast Exorcism /stopcasting macro<br />
<br />
The intent is that macro will not work in 3.2 (for Ret paladins or Enhancement shamans). The intent is that you have to push the button at the right time, not just have the game push the button for you all the time.<br />
<br />
Stopcasting a spell in this manner should reset your swing timer (at least for those two classes). We're not 100% sure at this time how the fix will work, but that's the intent or we would not have made this change.

Penance cooldown increased in 3.2<br />
When we looked at how much damage Disc was preventing with absorbs, it could equal the amount of healing done. That's a big number (though your mileage may vary).<br />
<br />
Furthermore, some Disc priests were pretty much down to just casting PoM, PWS and Penance. Increasing the cooldown is much less of a nerf that decreasing the amount healed because you still have that time in which to use another spell, such as a Renew or Flash Heal. It's a fun spell and we don't think this change will make it any less attractive for PvP or PvE. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/17900021503-gc-we-beg-you-nerf-penance-glyph-not-spell.html))<br />
<br />
Penance Glyph<br />
Yeah I agree with Odes in this case. Many, if not most, Disc priests had the glyph already. While it would be swell in an ideal sense if every spec had 6 or more legitimately equal options for glyphs, we realize that within the confines of raid progression it's likely that some are going to win out. Many websites declare the best major glyphs for any given spec. I can't imagine you consider your talent options to be extremely flexible, yet that doesn't seem to have garnered this much attention.<br />
<br />
We'll try over time to add some more choices through major glyphs, but really it's hard to imagine all of this consternation is because &quot;We now have less glyph flexibility!&quot;<br />
<br />
But I do want to understand if for some reason the 2 sec holds special significance. I understand if it only leaves you room to cast a Flash Heal, but really adding another spell to your rotation isn't the worst thing in the world.

Warlocks in Arenas<br />
We think warlock representation is too low in Arenas. One solution to that is to nerf classes that counter them, which we have done.<br />
<br />
We gave pets resilience and spell pen, which is a pretty significant change that affects one of the lock's biggest weaknesses. The Fel Dom change will help here too.<br />
<br />
The resilience change is also a small relative buff to warlock damage. Your damage won't change all that much in PvP, while other classes will go down. Furthermore, as the average length of matches increases, classes with lots of sustainability can benefit, and locks don't typically have mana problems.<br />
<br />
Player have a tendency to weigh class changes based on the number of bullets after their class name. Glass half-empty types see long lists of nerfs. But the quantity of the changes is usually unimportant. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17900081520-so-your-happy-with-warlocks-then-.html))</div></div><hr />

I still don't get why they need buff, they can make loads crits from 7-14k even in short time while keeping some feared. If not to much are on high brankets it is because they play to less...there are other classes that need more attention to get boosted up in brankets. Pointing to shadow priest and elementel shaman(maybe enhance, not sure), they can't be found anywhere in high branks...<br />
<br />
How is it that if a class that is not in top brankets for 1 season out of 6 they need a boost to make it back in again. Please consider watching more classes that need it more. At this point i am receiving a message it is a MUST that they stand at the top.</div></div><hr />

There's a big difference between being stuck to the ground, 100% no less, and being able to fly over obstacles and mountains easily with 280%... <br />
<br />
I'd like to be self reliant - and having a couple of people having low level resources on farming (Because they sell better in AH than high level resources, like Iron and Mithril) I wouldn't look forward to if I were to level an alt, and find resources pretty darn hard to find thus being forced to buy off the AH for numerous gold - let alone the fact it wouldn't be fair on new comers as they'd lack that money.</div></div><hr />

[...] The old world was not designed to support flying (this is a technical issue currently, not an unwillingness to allow this on our part) and by having the level requirement for flying, it allows us to set a pace at which we feel content should be accessed. As you can see by the recent mount changes, this could be readdressed at a future point in time. (Source)<br />

Yeah those battles where great. It went on on my realm for about a year before it really died. Indeed EPL and Silithus are jokes no one ever did them.

They think mages are taken seriously in terms of aoe damage? They think we do 'great' with blizzard? No.<br />

I lost what little faith I had left in blizzard's class balancing team, especially when taking into account the proposed prot pally and tank DK changes. They cannot do things sensibly, it's always a huge knee-jerk reaction change in one direction, be it buff or nerf. And that's not even taking into account the blindness of the class designers to the most blatantly obvious flaws in some classes, such as mage aoe, heavily fire spec oriented ulduar gear, relying on a debuff applied by tanks for 12 fucking % extra damage, the list goes on.

The reason so many priest's used Penance rather then other spells is because there was no reason not too. It healed for a ton wasn't stoppable outside of stuns. Yes, maybe you did have trouble against rogues. What about every other bloody class. I play a ret pally. I can could not kill a disc priest unless they played stupid or me and my resto druid partner just out lived his mana over the course of 5mins. In the end, the only reason we won was because druid's mana bar's last longer then a priest and thats only if the priest doesn't play well.<br />

<br />
Destro recieved a nerf. 2 shotting people? Well no, if you got a good combo off you could burn someone down very quickly but that required the lock to be totally free open casting and not really being touched. Dispell immolate and they can't do that crazy burst. Get a melee or two on em and they're dead in a few globals too. <br />
<br />
Their pet provided soul link but it could be killed in the blink of an eye and killed again after they blew their 15 minute cooldown to resummon it so it was like soul link wasn't even there. So why not give them the ability to accually keep the talent? The pet is not unkillable, it just takes a little more to kill it. After killing 2s and having warlock representation so low in 3s, this change was inevitable 'cmon.<br />

But I guess that, or something similar is a pipe dream, as they'd have to balance twice, and obviously that isn't viable for them, or they'd introduce this change already. Regarding, World PvP (for that whats left of it), PvE balance is more then fine in my book.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Additional instances cannot be launched!<br />
We do have plans to address this, but it requires hardware infrastructure maintenance and reorganization which can take some time to prepare and implement for all realms and battlegroups. We are working to address the situation as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
On a side note, your concern is perfectly legitimate. There was no need to bring up forum moderation regarding another player's account, as that is a violation of the Code of Conduct. Raising a concern on the forums requires only that one comes here and discusses it in a civil fashion, not spam us out of frustration, then send in one's friend to repost on one's behalf in only a slightly more reasonable fashion&quot;<br />
<br />
No, it is a not a hardware problem. The problem started when they lowered the number of instances allowed. I never ever had lag in an instance. Stop ruining the instances because of people with shitty computers. If this was a minor problem I wouldn't care, however this problem is huge. Yesterday I sat there for 1 hour and 45 min trying to get in repeatedly. I went out for a few hours with a friend, came back and same issue. Went out again to a BBQ and came back late and wanted to try again, same issue. This is an entire day of not being able to use the instances. On any level this is inexcusable, especially when the problem was SELF INDUCED by lowering the number of instances involved. Worst part is this happens during non peek hours. Just put it back to the way it was and all is well, stop touching things that don't need fixing.<br />
<br />
There have two blue posts now that stress how paladins need a choice to spam other than holy light. WHo the hell used holy light?! Seriously?! WHat data do they get that from? I don't know a single paladin, and I asked most of the raid guilds on my server incluiding mine and my own personal experience, who touch holy light. They tell me and I confirm that you might use it once or twice per boss fight. Blizz is totally out of touch. Spamming holy light means instant OOM. Just boggles my mind that they are that out of touch with reality. Spamm flash and holy shock and your g2g. But hey if they are buffing flash due to this falsely percieved problem that is fine with me because thats all that is used anyway except in rare occasions.</div></div><hr />

Well don't all of the high-end raiders all have T8 anyway and already look alike? And wont they when they get T9? I hardly see this as an argument and if I recall its only 2 pieces of T8 available for badges. To my knowledge the fear of homogenization was more between the class mechanics than the items. Okay this badge change is wierd and I don't quite agree with it either but your argument just doesn't seem logical to me.</div></div><hr />

Yes it is a hardware problem. Our whole raid lags almost every night and wenesday is just not playable if you do not clean the first 4 boss before everyone starts raiding. Shitty computers don't have anything to do with lag, your internet connection might if you have a 56k... <br />

<br />
You can get any answer you want if you ask the right people. I'm sure if you looked long and hard enough you could find a Paladin that uses Holy Shock to the exclusion of every other healing spell they have. <br />
<br />
Holy Light easily accounts for 70%+ of my and my raid's other Holy paladin's healing. His % is actually even greater than mine, but with his ~30k raid buffed mana pool, you can afford to do that kind of thing. If you're using FoL on fights like XT hardmode, General, Hodir Hard mode (where you would only have about 3 healers total where the MT is ENTIRELY your responsibility) then you should re-evaluate your playstyle. I could, if I wanted, use FoL a majority of the time. The DK tank would be out-healing me at that point, but I could do it. <br />
<br />
The changes coming to Holy Paladins are needed, and I'M a Holy Paladin. I welcome the Beacon change actually. The ability of it to stack as well as count for overheals means that all I really need to do is keep my eye on my Beacon timer (which I already do) and make sure it stays up and just heal the raid. With the Illumination and Divine Intillect nerfs I may have to watch my mana a little more carefully, but I doubt it will have a major adverse effect on me. We'll have to see though.</div></div><hr />

We took an informal vote and everyone here thought shamans with swords went against a lot of the traditions of the class in the lore, and DKs with fists was kind of weird too. Rogues seemed like the class that would pretty much pick up any weapon in a fight -- they use a broken bottle in at least one notorious case.

Frost might still do okay with 2H. We didn't specifically nerf their 2H abilities. We just gave them a talent to make DW more viable.

don't tell me frost dps might be okay ? u really don't know ur own game ? like u don't want to say u just lower the dps for the weakest spec u just nerf frost strike damage and now it can be dodge/block/parry and it was like 40% of my dps :s<br />

Why is it retarded? The object of WoW is to see and play end game content, not to have some super cool gear. Its only retarded when people feel the need to stand around and show off their gear all day rather than playing and enjoying the game.<br />
<br />
Getting everyone up to tier gear will make it easier for 10, 25 man and pvp raids to happen. It still takes a hell of a lot of heroics to farm gear if its anything like TBC was and if for anything it shows the people working for the gear at least have worked for it.<br />

The changes to illumination is a nerf, absolutely, but there are very blatant buffs included as well. Boohoohoo I can't heal entire fights and still end up with 75% mana. You are clearly a better representative of 100% of the paladin population. ZOMG BEACON NOW HEALS WITH OVERHEALING!!! TOTALLY NERFED!!! FoL on an SS'd target now gets a HoT!!!

The buffs are not earth shattering, but nor are the nerfs. Get off your high horse. Killing the game indeed.</div></div><hr />

Literally within a month or 3 of 3.2 release, EVERY SINGLE 80 will be in t8. There will literally be NO VARIATION of item selection between players of maximum level, because once you hit that sweet spot lv80, you'll just farm heroics all day. Can you imagine walking around Dalaran, EVERY SINGLE PERSON is wearing the same gear? thats just retarded/ridiculous. This change would also make every loot pre-ulduar obsolete, all that matters would be badge-whoring and ulduar + colliseum (which only the guilds that continue to care about progression would participate in, there is no doubt manyy will fall to players who quit raiding due to the badge bonanza).<br />
<br />
<br />
I kinda agree with this to some extent but then again ive seen people no longer doing heroics or any of that sort simply cause theirs no point in doing that anymore.<br />
and it has also brought a big decline in people playing the game in certain times and making others quit game cause theirs no point in playing if theirs no one to play with anymore.<br />
<br />
but now blizzard needs to adjust the difficulty lvl of this heroics or people are gonna be zerging em.</div></div><hr />

You know why? Because I thought them to be fun.<br />
<br />
Now to come to the arguments everyone is bringing up, just calculate how many hours you'd have to spend in heroics for one piece of t8. Then think how much gear you could earn in raids in the same period of time.<br />
Add to that the fact a lot of slots aren't filled by emblem gear and you still have a very large edge wearing your bis raiding gear.<br />
<br />
I completely don't understand the point of &quot;but I won't know whether people are skilled or not&quot;, do you know that now? I often saw rogues in t7.5 (when that was the highest tier) that still couldn't do more than 800 dps Gear proves nothing, check for achievements or just play with people you know.</div></div><hr />

But, it would be quite different than what im used to and to be honest, if i could fly in Azeroth, Northrend, and Outland, i would never use my ground mount again if some other changes to the mount system weren't made. Even if Epic Mounts will be level 40 and flying mounts are 70, on my 80's i'd never hop on my ground mount ever again. Other than that, changes are welcome!! 3.2 will be amazing and Midsummer is rockin!</div></div><hr />

Boohoohoo I can't heal entire fights and still end up with 75% mana. You are clearly a better representative of 100% of the paladin population. ZOMG BEACON NOW HEALS WITH OVERHEALING!!! TOTALLY NERFED!!! FoL on an SS'd target now gets a HoT!!! NERFED TO THE GROUND!!!<br />

By &quot;Killing the game&quot; I mean, of course, not this particular change to paladin, but all set of changes we are watching across last set of pathes and hotfixes.* Changes are made premature.* Changes are &quot;hacks&quot; in game mechanic rather then fix. Changes increase disbalance more and more. There seem to be no long term plan (they start to call something &quot;problem&quot; the day after they call it &quot;solution&quot;). Just few examples - 2x2 arena bracket killing now following BG killing early in WOTLK. Paladin overbuff followed by half a year of nerfs.* The way they are trying to fix lag in Wintergrasp. Warriors fury tree and continuous changes to titan greep. This list is very long.* But the tendency is clear - this team is overconfident and overarrogant - they act first and think second (if at all), they don't listen when people make them advices *before* they change but react when majority QQ after the change.* All in all the way they drive the game is killing it. <br />
<br />
As about paladins nerf/buff - if they give holy an ability to create colored clouds when they /fart that would be kinda buff as well - nobody else can create colored clouds when /fart. However it doesn't help much with the holy paladins (yet) main job - to heal MT and help with raid healing when possible.* What the (experienced) paladins around here are saying is that they can find a target which would be healed without over healing in raid, thus BoL buff doesn't help them. And that person, who will have, SS is the MT and while MT is hit for 20-30k he/she needs damn Holy Light, not 4k (or even 10k)* healing over 12sec. So, for the paladin who already know his job and can use BoL appropriately the buff part is about as usable as colored clouds from /fart. And the nerf is significant.* So, the sum is pure and simple nerf.</div></div><hr />

One solution to that is to nerf classes that counter them, which we have done.Right, they nerfed feral druids. But wait ferals have low representation in arena as well and don't have insane synergy like warlock/rogue teams. While rogues will continue to own every warlock and were not nerfed at all. So where is the sense?</div></div><hr />

If Blizzard allows flying in Azeroth, players can just fly strait over and into some of the factions' home cities. Such as, Orgrimar and Stormwind. On the other hand, flying can be very useful for the higher level players that like to do the Pre-Burning Crusade raids for achievements or special mounts.</div></div><hr />
