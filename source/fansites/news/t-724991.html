Increase damage done? Typo or something? Makes more sense if it was healing done.<br />

For PvPness? O.o<br />
<br />
The fact that it reduces movement speed again bothers me, especially with the increased movement speed bonuses everyone else is getting, which leads me to believe a lot of movement-based mechanics will appear.<br />
<br />
Unless they want healers dpsing in raids (which with their mana useage plans doesn't make sense), I'd say it's either a typo or a pvp talent.</div></div><hr />

Your most likely going to want talents like Imp Tranquility (at least for 3s/5s) because of the new 50% dmg reduction. GotEM is also good with the instant heal... and maybe haste? It's in the blue post but not in either of the talent calculators. Should take it to the Druid forums tho, and don't forget that the resto tree is only 90% done (on it's 1st Pass)</div></div><hr />

<br />
By &quot;significant number of dps talents&quot; you mean the ONE filler point that isn't spent on utility/mana cost reduction/healing improvement? You can get all the most important PvE-resto talents at level 79 even: http://cata.wowhead.com/talent#0VGcokZZf0ftfkfxRAcoVo<br />
<br />
The 6 remaining points (at 85) you can spend on whatever you like. Also bear in mind that these talents are not yet final.<br />
<br />
I am super excited about the changes to resto. It will be an amazing ride.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hate what they are doing with restro. Hate it. I'm totally not convinced that it will be good for PvP. The ranged silence is easily avoided and so has very limited utility. I do not like the idea of restro in PvP being a mix of offense and defense. It's ok with cyclone and so on but Spellsurge as PvP?? Hell no!! We are healers after all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Remember that in Cataclysm, Demoralizing Roar and its equivalents will reduce damage taken (by 10%, I think?) rather than reducing enemy attack power. With this in mind, I think Feral Aggression will be taken by all tanks. How many points they put in it is another matter.<br />
<br />
However, as damage reduction is always popular with tanks, I'd even go so far to say that I'd take the three points left, and the two from Brutal Impact, and put all five in Feral Agression. It's too bad the talent is still saying something about attack power reduction. They must not have caught that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This would mean it wouldnt interfer with cp generation for pve rotation, also it wont hinder pressure in arenas as u could pretty much SR after u open making it a worth while opener as well as a good finisher when combined with FB on a near death opponent after using the new Improved Feral Charge<br />

<br />
* Tree of life as a temporary healing boost on a 5min cd seems kind of annoying. Presumably it would have to be off the gcd (like lock's Metamorphosis is, isn't it?), so I guess I could macro it into a couple of different heals and not bother trying to time it. Blizz is doing this because we never get to see our armor, right? Hmm.<br />
<br />
* By lvl 79 I have all the talents I want for PvE. The remaining 6 points can get me to 2/3 Dreamstate or max out Imp Barkskin and Tranquil Spirit. Happy days.<br />
<br />
* I hate being a raid-healing rejuve bot. Blizz seems to be trying to make my direct heals more attractive, but I'm not seeing us getting back tank healing duties (I may have underestimated the changes, however). What about some talents to allow us to specialise in one role or other, so we don't all have the same spec and the same jack-of-all-trades healing abilities?<br />
<br />
* No Living Spirit, I see. Will this become the unique bonus for the tree tree? [Edit: no, our mastery is &quot;deep healing&quot;, apparently. So, no bonus Spirit?]<br />
<br />
* PvP looks like it might be fun, as heals OR boomie...</div></div><hr />

not sure you need celestial focus outside of pvp..... <br />
<br />
bramble is another one of those pvp talents, thorn damage dont really make a difference in the long run....<br />
<br />
same with wrath of cenarius, the new change to it only increase moonfire damage, and very few times you are spamming moonfire on the boss<br />
<br />
and 90% of the time, your moonfire's damage barely make a difference (a glyphed IS actually beat this in damage)<br />
<br />
Nature's Majesty is a plus in crit chances in all your bread and butter spell, which is wrath, starsurge, starfire, and starfall<br />
<br />
Omen of Clarity procs more often than most believe, the 15% felt more like 20% considering how fast you can cast with 800-1000 haste.<br />
<br />
Lunar Justice is a leveling talent, it's not a pve or pvp talent.....<br />
<br />
Gale Wind is one of those debatable for me, it's good for aoe-ing trash, not so great on bosses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have the answer to your question right there in your own QQ:<br />
<br />
ToL gets it's restriction on DPS'ing lifted and will even get a buff to wrath (along with wtfpwn healing) while in that form. To offset this and to prevent ToL from being completely OP for PvP they offset it with reinstaing the movement reduction.<br />
<br />
A lot of QQ here along the lines of &quot;Nice that we get some awesome buffs but WHY ALSO SOME NERFS omg QQ&quot;.<br />
<br />
Guys try to understand this:<br />
<br />
The game has to remain reasonably balanced. IF YOU GET BUFFS YOU ALSO HAVE TO GET NERFS.<br />
<br />
Personally I like the way they are making ToL into a CD with some nice effects. Resto druids need more CDs in PvE, as Priest and Pala have had tons. If you put ToL on a cooldown it must obviously be buffed while up. If it is buffed while it is up, PvP balance (sensitive for anything that spells &quot;burst&quot;) demands that it is offset somehow in a way that mainly effects PvP (hence the movement reduction). Live with it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thomaster</div><div class="date">2010-06-11, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The best resto build I came up with so far is this: http://www.wowtal.com/#k=QsP2gEqcbyo5.9dw.druid<br />
The points in perseverance are just fillers. I dislike the idea of having to go into balance further just for dreamstate. Also, a cooldown on ToL is fine. The thing I have against it, is that it is 5 minutes. That means you only get to use it once per bossfight. I'd rather see it brought back to 3 minutes (2 minutes with talents) so you can use it, with a WotLK example, every time Festergut casts purgent blight. Also, what's the point in Fury of Stormrage? I alsmost HAVE to get it to get to 51 points, but it's not such a usefull talent for pve. You have to take quite a lot of pvp talents to fill the resto tree in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fair enough, you dont need to spend them there to get 51 points, what I meant was that after I've put points in every good talent in the tree, I have a few leftovers. The general idea behind cataclysm talents is that you have some extra points which you can put in less-than-mandatory talents. The thing is that after you've taken about everything good for a pve resto druid you have 7-8 points left which you can only spend in pvp/balance stuff. That's what I find to be a bit annoying.</div></div><hr />

========================================================================================== ==================<br />
<br />
MY comment, I love being in tree form. The only reason i have a druid is to heal, and i think its sweet to be in Tree Form.<br />
Personally, i will most likely re-roll a different class now. The whole reason there doing it is to nurff the Resto Druids for a currently OP class. Taking away something that make the class unique and more like the other class's takes away the fun of them.<br />
<br />
The whole &quot;Giving up healing to do damage works okay. Giving up everything to heal is lame.&quot; is a JOKE.<br />
<br />
If that were the case no one would want HEAL as a Druid. Even so, would it just not make sense to give Resto Druids a attack that they could use in Tree of Life Form. Cause casting Wraith &quot;Balance attack&quot; will not be fun!<br />
You cannot heal in bear, moonkin, or cat. You can not melee with the right spells in Bear, or moonkin. You cannot taunt or use any tanking abilities in cat or moonkin. And you cannot cats spells in cat or bear.<br />
<br />
Saying giving up dpsing for healing is lame. You don’t have to stay in tree in pvp. Buff druid spells and nurf tree armor if your worried about that. If your worried about being out of Tree in raids to dps you have a problem.<br />
<br />
In my opinion DON'T take away the from, Nerf it/Change it, DON'T turn it into a Useless Cooldown <br />
How do you Nerf a class without making them overly angry? You say “we want to help you, make the game more fun, though with that your heals may take a bit of a hit”.<br />
<br />
aka, when i heal, i'm not looking at my bars for when i can hit my trinkets or cooldowns. I'm looking at the raid for who needs a heal. If i need to look at my bars people die! more or less a passive ability is greater then a press me.<br />
<br />
When you roll a druid, you roll it knowing you will be in a Shifted form. That is the lore of a druid. That’s what we are supposed to do. You don't roll a druid thinking, I’m going to stay in human form.<br />
<br />
As for the &quot;Resto Druids didn't originally have Tree of Life Form, So whatever was appealing about Druids back when Tree of Life didn't exist&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt; well Sorry I didn't play wow Back then, and if i did, well i guess THEY wouldnt have been Appealing to me!<br />
<br />
USELESS: having no beneficial use or incapable of functioning usefully<br />
JOKE: a ludicrous or grotesque act done for fun and amusement<br />

I can see why some people like telling us to stop whining about the new ToL. YES we do get a &quot;increased healing done by 15%&quot;. The thing is just: Didn't we already have that buff in the form of the talent &quot;Gift of nature&quot; (which increased healing by 10%) which is now removed, together with the old Improved ToL? (not to forget that the old ToL talent reduced mana costs of all HoTs by 20%..)<br />
<br />
And what's up with all the &quot;increased DPS&quot; in the resto spec?? I'm a tree because I like HEALING. If I wanted to cast Wrath, I would go balance. You dont see the holy palas and the other healers going &quot;Omg, i was 15th on the DPS-meter!&quot; because that's not our job! <br />
<br />
Another thing: Apparently our HoTs will benefit by crit and haste in cata... Sooo I guess that's why our Gift of the Earthmother AND Nature's Bounty is nerfed? Why, thx alot!<br />
<br />
Last thing: Why have nobody mentioned that Wild Growth now have a 10 sec CD instead of 6?? I swear I died a little inside when I saw that... <br />
<br />
I'm definitely going to miss raiding, now when shamans seem to be taking the druid-spot... And I'm personally going to miss being a tree!!</div></div><hr />

Even in PVP gear, it added up to over 100 spellpower towards the higher end.<br />
<br />
Not to mention im most mad that Eclipse even exists in cata; essentially as does now. Eclipse is boring and a terrible talent. It alone accounts for 15% of our dps (when it works and RNG are merciful). To see that as our mastery and so many talents focused around that is depressing..<br />
<br />
