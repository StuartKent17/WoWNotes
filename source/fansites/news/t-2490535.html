Kotaku Article - Blizzard Cancels StarCraft First-Person Shooter to Focus on Diablo and Overwatch<br />
According to a new article on Kotaku (https://kotaku.com/sources-blizzard-cancels-starcraft-first-person-shoote-1835285125), rumor has it Blizzard canceled a StarCraft first-person shooter that has been in development for the past two years. Click the banner below to read the full article and Blizzard's response to it.<br />

<br />
<br />
The cancellation was made in order to focus on Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2.<br />
The canceled project was code-named Ares.<br />
It was described as being similar to the Battlefield franchise, but in the StarCraft Universe.<br />
According to sources, it was a massive shock that Blizzard canceled it as it was &quot;looking quite good.&quot;<br />
Nobody has been laid off as a result of the cancellation, but moved to the upcoming Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2.<br />
Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2 are expected to be announced at Blizzcon in the fall.<br />
Overwatch 2 is rumored to have a large PvE element, and has been compared to Left 4 Dead.<br />
Ares started as an experiment to do something with StarCraft on the Overwatch engine.<br />
Blizzard has wanted to move as many games as possible to the same technology as the Overwatch engine to be more efficient.<br />
Dustin Browder, who led Heroes of the Storm and StarCraft II, was supposed to be the director of the project.</div></div><hr />

you must have missed the memo, destiny was never activision's to begin with, and they have dissolved their partnership with bungie which is why in the expansion coming in september the game will be moving off the bnet launcher to steam.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Overwatch 2 instead of a Starcraft shooter we've been waiting for since we saw Ghost. Also seems like another huge misstep by Blizz. Not knowing their audience.. Sure OW has it's fans but Starcraft has a lot of lore behind it, is established franchise that is over 20 years old and had fans spawning generations vs a game that has been falling like a rock and OWL seems to be heading for an iceberg Titanic style.<br />
<br />
Then again, I might be a bit overly critical about OW, but outside of the Cinematics looking cool. I'm just not invested in the story, because you have to go beyond the gameplay to get even a glimpse of what has happened to the world and what is currently happening.</div></div><hr />

<br />
HoTS is a a fully released game with multiple development cycles in its history and future. How is that a &quot;cancelled&quot; game? Cancelled means it was never released... You could maybe say &quot;abandoned&quot; since they took focus off of it but even that is a stretch, since there is still active development on it.</div></div><hr />

I'm guessing its a story mode/singleplayer expansion and not a fully new game. Although i'm not sure that warrants a huuuge amount of resources to it, like its being described here.<br />

<br />
Yep. Along with Diablo Blizzard just seem keen on beating the shit out of their original franchises until they are nothing more than a pile of mush.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steelcryo</div><div class="date">2019-06-06, 11:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I expect Overwatch 2 is just an unnamed expansion. I'd be surprised if they released a whole new game that erased everyones progress and collections so soon after releasing the game. In game dev + online gaming 3 years is pretty short for a game like Overwatch. Especially when you add in the money people may have spent on loot boxes which creates additional attachment to the game making people less likely to give it up in favour of a new one.<br />
<br />
One thing a lot of people have been asking for though, especially since the release of the first PvE event, is more permanent PvE content. So an expansion based around PvE the size of a standalone game would make sense, especially as they want to bring back more attention to Overwatch to boost their E-sport scene. So not only would it sell well to those who want PvE content, it'd boost the E-sport scenes interest and it would also give them a playground to release new modes and hero abilities that would be completely unbalanced in PvP content, which again would increase interest in the game. <br />
<br />
I might be wrong and they may have reasons that they need a new game. Personally I don't mind which it is. I've not really spent enough on the game to make me upset if I lost what I had gained plus I've got over 250 free lootboxes unopened at the moment just from playing and earning them through xp/arcade over the last year or so. So yeah, not really too attached or bothered about collections. They're nice but if a new game was fun and an improvement on the current game, I'd happily move over to it.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the Starcraft cancellation, I do find that a shame. I love the Starcraft games and the universe they created and an FPS inside that universe with some of the units and characters from the other games would have been awesome. Hopefully D4 learnt its lessons from D3 and makes up for the cancelled project be being awesome.</div></div><hr />

Honestly I think it isn't a full on new games but a substantial enough PVE mode to make the game go from patch 1.x.x to 2.0. Assuming this is true.</div></div><hr />

Titan. The MMO Blizzard was working on with Overwatch as it's minigame. They are basically just going ahead with that MMO but on a smaller scale i guess....I think it was Titan.</div></div><hr />

That is the part I do not understand either. People are going to be massively pissed if they get a similar game where they shall start from scratch. Overwatch ain't old enough for that. If they are smart then OW2 will just add parts to Overwatch1. Basicly rebuilding Titan as more and more modules get added.</div></div><hr />

Yep. They don't want to fix the game. They just want money! Reselling the same game. 100% I bet my whole house on that there will be heroes in OW2 from OW... So there is no reseon to put out a new OW...<br />

<br />
People like artists don't need much proficiency with the style of gameplay to crank out material. Heck even most programmers probably don't care as long as they have experience with the engine. It's pretty much only gameplay design and strategic positions that are affected by something like that.</div></div><hr />

Diablo isn’t a lost franchise by any means. It just has a lot of really ticked off fans that were patiently waiting for a big announcement only to hear “Don’t you have phones?!” Diablo 4 is very much wanted. <br />

Depending on how the PvE element of Overwatch 2 will turn out, I might actually be interested. Diablo 4 would also be on my list. Now I just wonder if Blizzard isn't big enough yet to be able to develop a third game at the same time, especially if this game is already 2 years in the making (even though we don't know how far along).<br />
Blizzard has a bad history of cancelling games. This is also a way to burn though money. Were they thinking that finishing these games (by putting more money into them) and selling them would end in a bigger loss than scrapping them? The like to bring up that the game (like Starcraft Ghost) wasn't up to their quality standards but this is a &quot;meh&quot; excuse because we couldn't see for ourselves.</div></div><hr />

Absolutely 0 faith that this was not intended as a MTX-riddled BR cash grab. But actually shocked that they wouldn't want to go through with such a game. I suppose that means craploads of single DLC MTX characters, acts and story chapters for D4 and OW2.</div></div><hr />

I wonder if OW 2 will be an expansion, I don't think people'll be happy with losing cosmetics otherwise, or if it'll just be a PvE only game or w/e. Kinda like how HS and WoW are both warcraft but obviously different genres, we'll see, I guess.<br />

They chose the safest financial bet. Even though D4 will suck ass compared to Poe. I'm 120% sure the design will be 99% same shit as D3.<br />
As much as D3 sucks they still have a loyal base and they know D4 would still sell well initially. <br />
Overwatch 2, again the same thing . Easiest way to farm the still loyal base along with the guaranteed overall sales from all the people that tried the first Overwatch.<br />
<br />
Expect the same garbage lazy casual design as in everything blizzard did last years. <br />
Activision is fisting them really hard.</div></div><hr />

Something that always come to me are... Why not focus on all of the Games they allready have... and expand on those ideas/Univers, they have Starcraft, warcraft, Diablo and Overwatch<br />
<br />
There are so many good ideas an projects they can expand with those core ideas... so why not move forward with an Starcraft FPS... I can just immagin to be a Ground trooper marin.... while a HUGE ZERG SWARM ATTACKS.... the sound and the ground shacking.... the feeeling and the Terror it would be to play something like that would be kinda amazing.<br />
<br />
They have their reasons... just kinda sad to see they Missuse such Potential.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't get this either.<br />
<br />
Either the game looks the same so they transfer the skins to Overwatch 2 and add PVE, basically an expansion rather than a new game or<br />
they have to remake all skins on the new engine to be able to transfer progress and I highly doubt this is the case.</div></div><hr />

<br />
D3 is currently one of their best games imo, but lets not forget the complete disaster that was its launch; a steaming pile of unpolished, unfinished and greedy garbage that was given away for free to save the sinking ship that was Cataclysm. They fixed it with RoS, but they also sold that fix as an expansion and the ship had sailed at that point. The game never got a fair shot. <br />
<br />
I wonder whether they will again try to experiment greedily. I'm sure they won't make the same mistake with a RMAH, but they might still push the envelope with a cash shop. I assume PoE will inspire them to do so. But then they also have to make up for the Diablo mobile fiasco, so I'm not sure how far they are willing to push things. I really think that if they fuck D4 up it will be a big blow to Blizzard as a brand. Promises and guarantees of quality and fun games will die on the spot. <br />

Other, far more competitive games then OW (like cs:go) support 21:9. They can ban it from competitions if they really want to, but at the end of the day 144hz+ monitors are FAR more of an advantage in OW then 21:9 so their stance is very hypocritical.</div></div><hr />

In the article on Kotaku, they say that Blizzard said:<br />
<br />
<br />
We don’t generally comment on unannounced projects but we will say the following:<br />
<br />
We always have people working on different ideas behind the scenes – including on multiple projects right now – but the reason we tend not to discuss them publicly is because anything can happen over the course of development. As has been the case at Blizzard numerous times in the past, there is always the possibility that we’ll make the decision to not move forward on a given project. Announcing something before we feel it’s ready stands the risk of creating a lot of frustration and disappointment, both for our players and us, not to mention distraction and added pressure for our development teams.<br />
<br />
We pour our hearts and souls into this work, and as players ourselves, we know how exciting it can be to see and know with certainty that a new project is coming. Knowing that changes or disappointments can happen doesn’t make it any less painful when we have to shelve a project or when an announcement doesn’t go as planned. We always make decisions about these things, regardless of the ultimate outcome or how things might be interpreted, based on our values, what we believe makes sense for Blizzard, and what we hope our players will enjoy the most. The work that goes into these projects – whether they ship or not – is extraordinarily valuable. It often leads to great things and helps foster a culture of experimentation here.<br />
<br />
With all that said, we’re very much looking forward to revealing other things we’re working on when the time is right.</div></div><hr />

It is all because of magic and art mistakes. Look how red the fire is and then look at the yellow stones. I wouldn't blame art direction but spell effects which are very messy, especially when there are multiple players.<br />

That has colors, yes. No one in their right mind would look at it and say &quot;Wow! That's ÜBER COLORFUL!&quot; though. Something doesn't have to be monochrome to not be colorful. Diablo 3 has had a lot of problems throughout its lifetime, but being too bright/cheery was never one of them. It's still a very visually grim &amp; gritty game, just like its predecessors.</div></div><hr />

C&amp;C Renegade was a lot of fun and we all know C&amp;C wasn't an FPS. Halo has an RTS in the series, but I haven't played it. I don't know anyone who only plays RTS exclusively, there just aren't enough being made these days.<br />

The starcraft universe used to be pretty decent until 2 rolled along, but maybe an FPS could have gotten it right. Now we'll never know.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard in no way gave a response that confirmed or denied the existence of a Starcraft FPS, but was left ambiguous to the point of not even really being a response. Put simply, the response stated they do not talk about what they are working on but they always have new things they do work on. Sure, there might be a FPS Starcraft game they were working on, but there also could be a new MMO, a new turn based or action RPG featuring Anduin, Velen, Thrall, and Jaina where they travel around battling a new threat thru time and space. They could be working on a new sports game similar to the old Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater games from the PS1 days.<br />
Kotaku even went further to state that they had information that D4 and OW2 would be the big announcements this year, but then covered their asses by stating that “this could change.”<br />
Just my personal opinion, but while I feel OW2 could be an upcoming release that given Blizzard’s handling of their IPs it would actually be an xpac or addon DLC for a more single player FPS. OW isn’t a game like SC or WC that has definitive end points at certain points in the games cycle. It is an evolving multiplayer game that continues to have new additions in terms of maps and heroes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh ya. This BlizzCon needs to be big so if these leaks are to be trusted, it will be pretty big. Diablo 4, Overwatch 2, I'm hyped.</div></div><hr />

Even more upseting is the fact they are canceling it to focus on a diablo IV (diablo III shouldnt even exist, major let down, let alone a fourth one) and a sequel to overwatch.</div></div><hr />
