Mimiron Hard Mode Nerfed<br />
In the past hours a lot of people have reported major changes to the hard mode version of Mimiron (See this post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=67728.0)). So far it looks like the changes are:<br />

The damage of Plasma Blast (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/64529/plasma-blast) has been reduced. <br />

So crap like this just make it all seem worthless, makes me think we should just stop playing and wait for it all to be nerfed to the ground sine any effort we put in will be asinine because it will just be nerfed once we're near killing it.<br />

In the past hours a lot of people have reported major changes to the hard mode version of Mimiron (See this post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=67728.0)). So far it looks like the changes are:<br />
<br />
Emergency Mode (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/65101/emergency-mode/) has been reduced to 25%. <br />
The damage of Plasma Blast (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/64529/plasma-blast) has been reduced. <br />
The damage of Heat Wave (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/64533/heat-wave/) has been reduced.<br />
Emergency Bots in Phase 3 no longer have a silence aura. <br />

Blizzard has their idea that some percentage (5-10%) of the raider base should be able to see/kill Algalon. If that isn't happening they will nerf the hardmode content until it is achieved.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's one major difference between the emblem system being re-vamped and this nerf- the emblem thing is happening next patch. The reason I'm QQing so much is because there's essentially NO difference between the guilds that have spent hours and hours and hours to kill the pre-nerfed Mimiron (like my own guild) and the guilds who will be able kill him in probably less than half the time.There's no title, there's no mount, there's no real recognition besides the date on the achievement. I'm never the type to make posts about how I disagree with Blizzard's logic, but SO much time was invested in this encounter pre-nerf and now it seems like all that effort has gone by the wayside. =(<br />
<br />
EDIT:: I'm not saying guilds that killed Mimiron before this nerf should get a mount or a title, but I do believe a nerf this significant should've been saved for the ABSOLUTE end of this patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not so sure if that applies since the guy is talking about a hotfix to a current encounter when you're talking about what would amount to old-world raid content after a new expansion....<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
This depends. The post didn't mention rapid burst or his other attacks that are used in various phases, so I assume the note about plasma blast and heat wave mean that those abilities have had their damage reduced along with the Emergency Mode reduction.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm liking the Mail Heirloom chest. When you put that on maybe we can climb the buildings too? Swing across some trees to lessen travel time. Blizzard has done it again for Wrath. Making me dissappointed in gear look. I miss the Vanilla and TBC days when gear had uniqueness... gah.. I'm gonna go QQ in a corner now..<br />

I'm still leveling and have barely even touched the Northrend endgame content and I'm blown away at how easy this stuff is. And as soon as something's hard... they make it easy. Give the hardcore raiders what they want...and let us casuals do some of the easier stuff. There is SO much to do, that if we miss 1 or 2 epic dungeons we aren't going to cry.<br />
<br />
If everyone can do it, it doesn't make it nearly as cool. I personally enjoyed the fact that sunwell in it's prime was a real gem of difficulty.<br />

<br />
Sorry, but your point is completely moot. We're not talking about raid changes between expansions, we're talking about a HUGE change within a single patch. Did the 70s clearing MC do so for the loot, or for the achievements? Were they racing against other guilds to see who could complete it first by putting in the most effort like the guilds in patch 3.1 are doing in Ulduar right now? Nope. =) GTFO</div></div><hr />

<br />
Regarding the hard mode nerfs...<br />
<br />
My guild has yet to attempt Mimiron hard mode, but I know he is very difficult. Being an ex-hardcore raider I can understand the frustration of wanting to keep a certain level of difficulty in this game for players. Regardless, Blizzard wants to make sure a certain percentage of their player base has access to the content. Even if players feel hard modes should be left alone and only for the upper tier guilds.<br />
<br />

While the blue devil is still slacking and my character copy hasn't been completed just yet, therefore all those titanium ores still rottens in my bank.. Was wondering if there is any information yet about prospecting, such as what is the average epic gem rate when prospecting titanium? Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That might be so, but Blizzard has flip-flopped again and Heroic raids (10-man and 25-man) are now going to be the hard raids.<br />
<br />
As for badges, we don't all get what we want out of those damn raids. You people complaining about people getting &quot;ez epics&quot; must have real awesome luck and get every damned item you want from a boss, yet those of us with bad luck keep getting shafted every freaken week when the boss doesn't drop that one piece of gear we want. Badges let us pick the gear we want that won't drop, and for ****'s sake, there better be weapons on the next badge vendor because I'm sick and tired of the bosses never dropping the weapon I need for an upgrade.<br />
<br />
So you see that? I raid, yet because of the random number generator, the gear I want DOESN'T DROP. Badges are good, and you can keep crying all you want, but in reality you're nothing but spoiled brats that get everything they need.</div></div><hr />

This is like.. video game socialism to the highest level. Hardmode Mimiron was one of the most challenging fights in the game, if not THE most challenging fight.. hard modes are NOT for casual players, so why are they being nerfed like they are? The casual players can do the normal modes, see the encounters and get loot, while the more dedicated players can do the harder content and get rewarded as such. WHY the nerfs? Seriously?<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, people around here know that I am usually advocating most changes to make the game accessible to a broad player base, but I agree here. Hardmodes should be hardmodes. They are tough and should be tough and for all I care can be the equivalent to pre-nerf M'uru or Twins. If only 1% of all players ever see Algalon..so be it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
~35 guilds killed Mimi hard prior to this nerf, in 8 weeks. The top guild on my server raids 6 days a week and is ranked ~400 in the world on wowprogress.com. Also, a lot of great guilds didn't achieve it prior to the nerf. This fix has brought it in line with the rest of the hard modes - feats that the majority of hardcore raiders can feasibly achieve. These changes have nothing to do with casuals. Maybe they allow a few more bad hardcore guilds to get the drakes, but 500+ guilds got the Black Drakes, I don't see why the Ulduar drakes should be limited to &lt;50 guilds.</div></div><hr />

Mimiron was NOT fine, it stuck out like a sore thumb compared to every other hardmode in the instance, and was in dire need of a nerf. And this is coming from someone who has killed it.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I mean seriously, has a single person moaning about this re-tuning even killed Mimiron hard, or ever tried pressing that red button on 25 man. I'm sure there are a few masochists out there who enjoyed banging their heads against bosses the level of pre-nerf M'uru, but I'm sure there are other games you can play that will give you a similar level of satisfaction, such as the exciting game of &quot;hammering nails into your testicles&quot;</div></div><hr />

We walked in last night and got to P4 first attempt. TBQH we got the head and feet down to ~5% and middle to 20% when he enraged, with no deaths. First fucking attempt.<br />

Fucked up a few times after that, but he died on the 4th or maybe 5th attempt. Should be a 1 shot from now on, I expect.<br />

It's more in line with every other Hardmode (easy as hell on 10m) now, which is good. Algalon and Yogg+0 should be the hardest fights, not some random keeper.<br />

Flask of the North is not meant to better than other flasks in terms of stats/performance. <br />
<br />
The alchemy perk is Mixology. In situations where you use your best flask, your perk is considered balanced compared to the other professions. In all other situations, your perk is missing while other professions' perks are still active. That is the problem FotN is meant to solve (by being a permanent item).<br />
<br />
That said, I agree that Alchemists need something more. Not in the permanent +stat department, but our Potion utility (alchy stone buff, BOP health/mana pots) has never recovered from the one-pot-per-combat change. Since BOP gear is no longer intended to be comparable to the current tier of raiding, they should consider making the 40% benefit for health/mana pots a passive benefit.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard changes too much and too fast.

<br />
You missed the part where it is affected by mixology and wasn't meant to replace the other flasks, it was just meant to provide for the extra ilvl of stats the other professions get all of the time. <br />
<br />
It's a great addition for the profession. <br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
<br />
That's what it is for! While the rest of your raid has opted to pass on Flasks, if you as an alchemist do, you are nerfed by the amount of stats their professions grant all of the time. It isn't meant to replace the regular flasks. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The one change they should implement is allowing the sending of Heirloom Items to any character, regardless of faction. <br />
<br />
<br />
Agreed. Actually I feel like they should do a couple things. <br />
1. Take into account that most of these items cannot be enchanted properly. They should remove enchantment from them altogether and adjust stats accordingly. <br />
2. Give you the ability to buy them and move them around your account free will, not just across one faction on one server.<br />
<br />
<br />
Aside from all of that, the badge system needs to be revamped to cover the harder slots to achieve. I don't care about tier gear or a new belt or bracers. We need the jewelry covered as well as weapons and trinkets, the slots that are the hardest to upgrade because so few are available already and they cross classes in utility. When a mail piece of spellcaster gear drops, it goes to me because I am our only shammy. Then when the mace I need drops, I have to fight with the Priests, Druids and Paladins because the stats on it look like upgrades for all of those classes.</div></div><hr />

Like people who got Hand of A'dal title on level 80 or even on level 70 after the 30% hp nerf (and skip all bosses to vashj and kael).<br />
<br />
<br />
The Hand of A'dal questline no longer gave the title after 3.0 hit, meaning the 30% hp nerf did not allow any more people to obtain the title. Same thing that happened to Amani War Bears, and all the Proto drakes thus far, so getting the title at level 80 is impossible.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways, it's safe to say, pretty much all the guilds who have killed bosses like Mimiron on hard mode are world class guilds. They already got their fame/status from killing it before anyone else. The real point of them nerfing the hard modes is as Blizzard has stated, &quot;for more people to see the content&quot;, which I don't think is a bad thing.<br />
<br />
Sure it means more casual guilds might be walking around with hard mode gear, but with 3.2 just around the corner, that is irrelevant. The fact that Blizzard has been first releasing the bosses at a high difficulty level and letting the top-tier guilds compete for world firsts, then slowly nerfing them as more guilds kill them is a good idea. It basically lets the hardcore players race to the glory, and after that, the more casual players also get to attempt to experience the same content. If you had killed it pre-nerf, you could boast about having done so, and people will still recognize you for your ability. When the casual guilds do end up killing the nerfed hard modes, these top end guilds will already be attempting the newest hard modes and getting even better gear.</div></div><hr />

Oh really, then why did most of my guild get it after the 30% hp nerf hit? Riddle me that.</div></div><hr />

because if they held on to the quest and turned it in, even after the patch, they could still get the title</div></div><hr />

Aye indeed, thus the 30% hp nerf did indeed allow people to gain the hand of adal title. ;)</div></div><hr />
