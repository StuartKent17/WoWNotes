Stable Size Increased<br />
Patch 5.3 adds another 30 stable slots for hunter pets, giving you room to collect all the dinosaurs (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/316700676874964992). <br />

Patch 5.3 PvP Changes<br />
One minor concern would be World PvP. If the item level of PvP gear is only 496, PvE gear might be very dominant here. To be fair with you though, I'm not that bothered with World PvP in the first place, so don't mind this at all. We are well aware that this is a concern that has arisen from players regarding the recently announced changes. While we understand that this is an unfortunate sacrifice for the overall betterment of PvP, we feel that this change will improve the state of both competitive and entry level PvP. This means that more players will be able to enter into PvP and as such increase to competition and the attractiveness of this fun and exciting area of the game.<br />
<br />
This doesn't mean that world PvP and duels will be ignored. We definitely understand that players are wanting more huge, epic and glorious PvP such as those that come from world PvP, we just don't feel that it's the right place with the faction imbalance that is present in such battles. We are also looking into trying to find some solutions that will help with PvE gear in duels as we have seen this is a concern as well.<br />
<br />
Let me elaborate: A tank has no use at all what so ever of PvP power, nada zip null. So he gets his shiny PvE gear with superduper tank stats on it, an insane amount of sockets. He then sockets and enchants all out resilience on everything becoming virtually immune to melee damage (hi dodge, parry and block!) and still extremely viable against casters.<br />
<br />
Basically no high rated RBG team will take a PvP geared tank, because they will benefit so much more from PvE geared tanks with the appropriate gems and enchants. <br />
That is something that we are also aware of, we don't want fully PvE geared tanks being the best choice for flag carriers either. Solutions to this are already being looked into.<br />
<br />
) Balance classes (huge issue) <br />
This is something we are constantly working to address, don't think that because we're making these changes that class balance has taken a backseat. <br />
<br />
2) Delete the 70 zillion CC possibilities on all characters <br />
We know that the current number of CC present in the game right now is a concern of players. Weâ€™re looking at ways to help with the number of CC in PvP combat right now, but it would be a large type of gameplay overhaul and can be risky to implement in the middle of an expansion cycle if the change is too drastic. <br />
<br />
3) Fix the amount of &quot;I can global you on 1 macro&quot; playstyle <br />
We are monitoring damage constantly and when we see a need to, we make tweaks and adjustments as they are needed. You can see this from the fact that several of these bursting macros are not as effective as they were previously.<br />
<br />
Since this has been designated the &quot;single feedback thread&quot; by Nakatoir, I'll post my input regarding tanks here, rather than finding a more specific thread or making my own. <br />
Not really the designated topic to discuss everything related to the patch 5.3 changes, but this particular thread is discussing the changes coming to PvP gear and it is always best to keep discussions about the same topic in one thread. That is why the other thread was locked and redirected here, because both threads were about the same thing <br />
<br />
I know GC hates the word &quot;scaling&quot;, but I'm afraid now its extremely relevant. HOW will the 65% damage reduction change in future patches? 65% would've been ridiculous in 5.0. Now its fine. Next patch, its too little. What to think of this? <br />
Who says that this number cannot be tweaked depending on the patch and the numbers being seen? This change gives us another knob that we can turn in order to balance out damage, just like Battle Fatigue does for healing.<br />
<br />
I thought it was obvious that what I meant was single feedback thread regarding the PvP gear changes. In the case of my post specifically regarding tanks, something that hadn't really been a focus so far in this particular thread and might have seen a bit out of context. <br />
Not at all, it is related to the topic and I addressed a similar comment in my last post. We want to make sure that PvE geared tanks are not the best option for flag carriers and are looking into ways to make sure that they will use PvP gear as their best in slot choices.<br />
<br />
I also would like to say how important world PvP is for many people, the sole reason I do arena, RBG's and get PvP gear is to be competitive in world PvP and be able to fight back in the world while doing dailies etc. <br />
<br />
Now the PvP'rs who focus soley or mostly on PvP are actually going to be worse off when fighting other players in the world. While players who do not PvP at all and only raid are going to have an advantage. It's not fun when the PvP gear you've worked so hard to get is only useful when you zone in to an arena or a battleground. And is otherwise useless. <br />
We completely agree. We don't want people who have worked so hard to get their PvP gear to be left out in the cold for world PvP either, but we feel that the overall benefits that this will provide are greater than the issues it creates for World PvP.<br />
<br />
While we do want World PvP to be an enjoyable experience for everyone, we are primarily concerned with instanced PvP. The reason for this is because world PvP generally comes down to ganking and the number of players on either side. This is not to say that we don't want World PvP and massive, out of control battles to flourish though, we are just not sure that something that suffers from major drawbacks such as faction imbalance is an optimal location for this.<br />
<br />
I do not understand why you have to remove the ilvl 512 from elite gear if it scales down anyways. If we keep the ilvl 512 we will have more of a fighting chance in world PVP whilst keeping the balance in Battlegrounds and Arenas <br />
Because then the conversion across to Season 14 would have been even worse than the transition from S12 to S13. We are aware that the armor not being an upgrade any more is not something many players are happy with, but it is becoming a prestige upgrade with 5.3 again where it will require a certain rating to obtain.<br />
<br />
1. what about pve set bonuses? how will you balance them? <br />
Which set bonuses are you most concerned about? We do not want the set bonuses to trump the other big benefits that are given by PvP gear, so tell us which ones you are most worried about, and why.<br />
<br />
3. what about legendary items? sha sockets and so on, are you sure it will be balanced enough? <br />
I assume you mean the thunderforged items, they all get lowered down to Ilvl 496 as well. The Sha sockets shouldn't be able to trump the value of PvP power, however we will keep an eye on this and make changes if we feel they are needed.

<br />
Patch 5.3 PvP Changes<br />
mm any idea about tank gears? i mean dodge,parry etc from pve gears? <br />
We don't want to see flag carriers running around in full PvE gear either and this is something that we are looking into sorting out. When we have more information on this, we'll let you know.<br />
<br />
Oh and healers dont need pvp power, they might go fully pve then. <br />
That is wrong actually, our intention is for PvP power to be much more useful in PvP than PvE gear.<br />
<br />
Understand that we don't want PvE gear to be the best in PvP either and are these changes should ensure that this remains so. The feedback that everyone is providing regarding these changes to gear is great and it's offering us a lot of useful information. Please continue providing all of this great feedback and positive discussion, but do so in a single thread.(Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/257670-53-gear-is-now-pointless-to-get/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7101010225?page=3#54))<br />

Reputation / Questing<br />
Players interacted with Shado Pan &amp; AC long before meeting the GL. It was a poor choice for a gate.<br />
Perhaps but GL was right there in the vale and had more quests. Not sure we'd make the same choices if we had a do-over. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/304352419020693505))<br />
<br />
gotta admit I've yet to get the enchant recipes bc I just can't stomach doing GL on yet another toon to revered.<br />
Much faster with Commendations and in 5.2 you can slowly progress via dungeons and scenarios. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/306784140701868033))<br />
<br />
Yeah, because that would imply people grouping up and being social and we sure in the hell can't have that!<br />
The Jade Forest raid wouldn't be social. It would be an obligation we'd all feel like we had to do to splash experience. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/306777685550587904))<br />
<br />
in fairness, and your(justified) dismissal of claims of a majority aside, the mop leveling experience has gotten mixed reviews<br />
That is the case for most things we do. We like the MoP leveling experience, though there are always way to improve. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/314830688249577472))<br />
<br />
my problem with dailies and rep is not the quests or the rep, it is the VP required to make purchases, double gate<br />
We double gate stuff all the time. It's a pretty time honored RPG convention. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/314775986552066049))<br />
<br />
Any plans to allow players to complete dailies and other quests while in a raid group? Current design is annoying.<br />
We would like too, yes. We just don't want to splash credit to the whole raid. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/314437038625669120))<br />

Well, shamans were in a very bad spot tbh. <br />
Resto druids are fine, but in truth we lack good burst healing and there's a lot of burst healing phases going on in this tier.</div></div><hr />

The point is that, currently, Holy Priest can slightly outheal a resto shammy on a stacked and stand-still phases, while still doing twice the healing on spread out ones.

Awhile ago, there was this snotty Â´world-firstÂ´ 25 man guild. For fear of being beaten by a 10m guild, they bashed 10M raiding as non-important to world first progression. Only 25M should count, they shouted. They ridiculed the accomplishments of all the 10M raiders.<br />
<br />
Do you have any clue what guild that was?<br />
<br />
The second Â´ironyÂ´ is that they then used the 25M raids to funnel gear to their 10M team. So that really begs the question.... if you have 25 people willing to raid to get you to Â´world firstÂ´... then why are you doing 10M? Yeah, we get it, it is more difficult to progress with 25Ms because you need more dedicated people.. But that is why 25M has always been the one everyone watched. Even their own comments while they were 25M against 10Ms indicated this. They HAVE 25 people raiding.. they CHOOSE to progress 10M because it is easier for them.<br />
<br />
I have no horses in the race, it is a meaningless thing to me... but their own words against 10M raiding while they were 25M, along with their current ability to field 25 players (to funnel gear for 10M progression).. certainly is a bit hypocritical.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Could you please point out how Paragon ever ridiculed 10 man accomplishments? A few statements were made regarding certain encounters but I don't remember anyone making that kind of general statement, not to mention the fact that Blizzard has actually improved the balance between different sizes since then.<br />
<br />
I would also like to point out that we really don't have 25 players available at the moment. We didn't use 25 man raids to funnel gear during this tier, we did it at the beginning of the previous one. I hope you also understand the difference between having 25 people ready to clear normal raids a few times (once a week, 4 times in total during the whole progress) and actually having 30 people (minimum) roster available to raid progress hours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, that's still as bad as comparing 400m and 100m sprints.<br />
<br />
The &quot;correct&quot;* analogy would be having two groups of people running a XXX meter sprint, first group has the 8 runners that the track was made for (although the boss areas usually tend to be designed around the bigger group), and the second group has 20 runners (2.5x8=20 [2.5x10=25]). Both groups run the same distance, but it's a hell of a lot more crowded in the second group, making it harder for some people along the way. But that's still irrelevant, as the best of the best will still run the same times on both groups, no matter the size. (i.e Usain Bolt would still run the 400m sprint as fast no matter if he's in the first or second group, because he's still a better runner than the rest)<br />
<br />
*There's really no CORRECT analogy, but only analogies that come close.</div></div><hr />

Back then Paragon was the best no doubt, but then they lost their roster and/or momentum, just like many guilds have before Paragon. It's hard to stay on top, and they found a way to prolong it by migrating to a smaller pond. Just because they cant compete for the most prestigious goals anymore, doesnt diminish their past accomplishments.</div></div><hr />

But, if my raidgroup is any indication (I'm a shaman), shamans are already quite powerful. Both as resto and elemental. The only person I felt did alot better was an enhancement shaman.<br />

But yeah, just one group..</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alayea</div><div class="date">2013-03-28, 02:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To be honest, resto druids could use some buffs more than resto shamans...<br />
Resto druids are pretty good in 10-man raiding from what I've seen from my own raid group and online research. 25s are a different ballpark, I'll agree. However, resto shamans did need a buff - just not sold on what the hotfix gave us.<br />
<br />
Take a look at this WoW Insider article (http://wow.joystiq.com/2013/03/26/resto-druids-vs-the-world-2-war-harder/). I'm curious to know what you think of it. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What is the point of buffing shaman grouped healing? They're already strong at that - what they don't have is a decent toolset for healing spread targets.<br />
They did buff Earthliving, which is a good step in my opinion. Chain Heal? I use that sparingly since the Tidal Waves effect isn't really enough incentive - see Riptide glyph - nor does a slow cast for a spell that depends on players being grouped up long enough to benefit from it (though 20% stronger may encourage more use of it). Healing Rain? Don't see how it helps any, considering that it was strong enough as it is.<br />
<br />
However, the problem I perceive is that this raiding tier heavily emphasizes lots of movement - which is long the bane of any resto shaman. To be certain, we've got Spiritwalker's Grace (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/79206-spiritwalkers-grace) to help in that department but it is a 2min CD and has rarely been considered more than just a band-aid.<br />
<br />
It's also possible, as suggested in the linked article from earlier, that our mastery is getting undercut by other healers' &quot;smart heal&quot; and sniped healing. Mastery: Deep Healing (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/77226-mastery-deep-healing) depends a lot on players being towards the low end of health - the greatest example of its usefulness was BWD's Chimaeron fight. So... <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Nice job and all, but WOW that is a horrendous screenshot.<br />
Rather poor job of trying to conceal one's tactics, to boot.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone knows if shaman buff is live in europe?<br />
The &quot;tweet&quot; was put out yesterday, so if the shaman buff hasn't gone live in the EU yet it definitely will have by tomorrow.<br />
