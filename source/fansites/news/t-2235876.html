<br />
<br />
Brawl - Packed House<br />
The Packed House brawl is now available!<br />
Up to 30 players clash in this packed Arena match<br />
<br />
<br />
Crafted Item Scaling<br />
Crafted items seem to be scaling to 900 ilvl instead of 885 like the patch notes say - intended?<br />
Correct. We'll have a complete hotfixes update later today with new hotfixes such as this one.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gul'dan Health Adjustment<br />
Any word on when we are going to know what the Guldan changes are? Would love to know before raid tonight.<br />
These hotfixes are not live yet, but they're mainly a small decrease to Gul'dan's health to offset changes to some items and set bonuses.<br />
<br />
<br />
Legion PvP Season 4 Begins!<br />
Legion PvP season 4 is here, and the Arenas and Battlegrounds await the clash and clamor of weaponry and magic once more.<br />
<br />
Season 3 Rewards Reminder<br />
If you participated in Season 3, please keep the following in mind to ensure you receive the rewards that you’re due:<br />
<br />
<br />
Refrain from transferring your character(s) to another realm or faction until after Legion Season 3 rewards have been distributed.<br />
Legion Season 3 titles and mounts will be awarded approximately two weeks after the season ends.<br />
<br />
<br />
Faction-Based Rewards<br />
Don’t forget—end-of-season rewards are based on your faction. If you transfer your character to the other faction, you must have 50 wins after your transfer to receive the reward. Please note that you must have 150 wins for Gladiator and Cruel Gladiator.<br />
<br />
The Arenas and Battlegrounds await!<br />
<br />
<br />
Artifact Power Reward Changes<br />
The official notes were updated with some additional artifact power changes.<br />
<br />
Legion Raid bosses now have a new Artifact Power item that drops 100% of the time, once per week, on all difficulties except Raid Finder. Bosses in the newest Raid drop more Artifact Power than older Raids.<br />
On Raid Finder difficulty, bosses no longer drop Artifact Power items. Artifact Power is now rewarded once per week at the completion of each Raid Finder wing.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Order Hall Mission Bonus Reputation Rewards<br />
Scuuuu on Reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/6h17e0/reputation_order_hall_missions_now_give_a_1500/) noticed that missions now reward Greater tokens, such as Greater Tribute of the Broken Isles (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/150924-greater-tribute-of-the-broken-isles), that award 1500 reputation.<br />
<br />

With the change to AP research speeds it won't matter at all. If people can hit AP 40 in a couple days, not being able to farm LFR like that to max AP is probably needed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
These changes are a direct result of the druid nerfs, removing mark of ursol. Since most guilds are rocking a druid soaking strategy they want you to be able to clear it the last week before tomb without having to change your entire strategy.</div></div><hr />

You must be new around here, they always nerf content after a while - either through gear upgrades or adjusting health pools. No one should be surprised about this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What about the above needs to be tested?<br />
If 4 hours really take 4 hours?<br />
If the older bosses nobody does on PTR drop AP items?<br />
If items that are crafted really are ilvl900?<br />
<br />
Sometimes testing doesn't make sense; especially when you can be sure the sample won't be big enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Why do they manage to make these statement so ambiguous every time...<br />
<br />
Does that now mean that every boss drops 100% a token in each difficulty or just once independent of difficulty. And if just once independent, are they the same amount? E.g., does Nythendra drop 900 base AP in Normal OR Hero OR Mythic? or still 500 base in normal 700 base in hero and 900 base in mythic?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cholerabob</div><div class="date">2017-06-14, 02:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On Raid Finder difficulty, bosses no longer drop Artifact Power items.

<br />
SO no more AP in LFR=no reasons to run LFR... Always out to screw people over Blizz, great job. <br />
<br />
Be sure to kill Ana-Mouz in Suramar for chance at item level 860 items and a Fel Relic.<br />
<br />
Oh and of course we will ALL rush out to get that shitty 860 gear when you can get 880 from shards...</div></div><hr />
