I agree. I dont need (or want) my guild chat and my add-on management in the same app. It feels like they only added the add-on management to the chat app to drive people to use that instead of discord.</div></div><hr />

This is exactly why you have this ad-as-content. It isn't free to run MMOC.<br />

<br />
Fix overlay please and make easy join link for members that are actualy typable and its perfect and maybe I buy new curse premium membership again.<br />
<br />
And I realy do not see reason to be negative over this app, no reason to be.<br />
<br />
also mumbeling about mmo-champion is part of curse.<br />
<br />
And Premium is not even needed, you can download up to 20 addons simotanious, no adds in app it self.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately it doesn't seem like we'll get any choice in the matter soon as everyone will be eventually forcefully upgraded. Here's some take away's of my time with it.<br />
<br />
* Another program trying to do what I already have other programs to do that are dedicated to that specific function.<br />
* Missing the Play button to launch your game. Why?<br />
* Took me probably 15 minutes after initial launch to go through all of the option to disable things I didn't want.<br />
* Not all options are clearly labeled to designate what they do. There are some helpful hints in places but those are vague as well sometimes.<br />
* Did not detect my PTR install during setup. <br />
* You cannot launch the app directly to the addon screen. You have to click the small WoW icon on the left-hand side taskbar. Why isn't this an option?<br />
* Longer app launch screen with animated intro. Why?<br />
<br />
Needless to say I was happy to switch back to v5 of the client and will continue to enjoy it until they rip it from me permanently. I'm not against app development progress when it makes sense. But when my app management program starts to behave like antivirus programs have over the years and get bigger and more bloated I have to look to another product or find another method. Unfortunately that other method would mean manual app downloads and version checking on my own. Sigh...</div></div><hr />

Does all addon functionality go away after the 23rd? Or just the &quot;Update All&quot; feature?<br />

Is there anything else that easily handles addons for free?</div></div><hr />

Actually you can launch it to the addons screen, though that is rather hit or miss after an update.<br />
It is a replacement for the previous curse client, which will in time be phased out.<br />
So if you used the previous client, then that isn't additional but intended in time to be a replacement.<br />
For me the splash screen duration isn't too different from the previous list of steps, though arguably if it is just for animation purposes an option to skip it would be nice.<br />
I agree that it doesn't do everything right, but then no program by a 3rd party will tend to.<br />
<br />
Curse make money off those extra services, so it makes sense to have them up front and center in the client if people do use them.<br />
Those that don't want an individual client, those that do may well benefit from them together.<br />
You can't please everyone.</div></div><hr />

Yep, that's because this and razer comms and some other turds are pathetic imitations of discord, which was first and brought good free voice comms to the masses.<br />

People will REALLY update their own add-ons? Or use Minion (especially when Wow interface doesn't have all add-ons up to date)?<br />
<br />
I don't get what all the fuss is about.<br />
<br />
If you've been around long enough, you'd realize that the curse client wasn't the first client to update addons, it just did it better. If they force this bloated steaming pile of shit on people, then yes, people will go back to updating their own addons until something else comes along. And yes, something else will come along and replace curse.</div></div><hr />

I have used Curse for years and would hate to have to stop. I just don't need all the extra bloat every time I want to simply update my addons.</div></div><hr />

This will open your settings. Now in the left pane select 'Addons'. Now in the top of the right pane select 'General'. Go to the option 'Show my addons at launch' and click the check box to toggle it to green.<br />
<br />
Now when you start the new Curse client it will open straight to your add-ons. You can hit update and then close the application.<br />
<br />
This should make it so the additional features do not inconvenience anyone who is only interested in managing their addons.</div></div><hr />

All I need is add-on management. I don't raid, I don't have a guild, I'm not a social media maven, who would I even make calls with... and I did leave several feedback notes after trying the new Curse application (may the word &quot;app&quot; die an ignominious death from the English language), so I do know something of what I am talking about. And, I view it only as fair warning to others: because of the addition of several features, the application used nearly half a gigabyte of memory. I have plenty of RAM, but that's not the point.<br />
<br />
(And just to soothe some feathers out there, it's not Curse-specific. I hate the Battle.net application, too, for many of the same kind of reasons, even though I understand the technical and business reasons for Blizzard using it.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The writing an update manager isn't hard, as you know it's been done several times before, the problem is the cost of bandwidth for millions of users, take DBM for example:<br />
<br />
3.8 MB download<br />
3.8 MILLION downloads per MONTH<br />
that's 15200 GB or 15.2 TERABYTE per MONTH just for DBM, not including all the other addons they host as well.<br />
<br />
People whinge, bitch, moan and complain but I don't see many people willing to pickup the slack for the cost of hosting all that bandwidth, and it certainly doesn't grow on trees, maybe Blizzard should? I mean it's their game...</div></div><hr />

I guess it's a bit bloated if you don't want to take advantage of the other features but at the same time those features work great if you want to utilize them.</div></div><hr />

So I find it cool they make new tool I could use. Fine and all. But as all I need is addon management, I would like to keep my v5, thank you very much. I can imagine someone might like the Curse app but please for heaven sake don't force me hand, orc. I'm fine if v5 will have new design as long as it will work as standalone app. It's good to have an option, but really, not everyone wants to have all-in-one solutions.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard should take this in their own hands, which would also allow them to just prune addons that will cause non-stop errors directly from the list of addons that can be activated. Then again, this is another thing for their off-game team which (as far as HotS interviews at gamescom went) are completely overloaded on their todo list.</div></div><hr />

Many people are complaining because they're phasing out a working piece of software and replacing it with a slow, bloated piece of meh...<br />
If they weren't cutting support the old client everybody would be happy.<br />
<br />
It's annoying but not really a big enough deal to shout this loudly about imo.<br />

The ad's just the icing on the cake - at least I'm not too fussed about the ad itself, but it does push a few buttons.</div></div><hr />

As for the app, works great for me, updates everything fine as per the old app. I won't use any of the other shit since it's not much relevance to me.<br />
<br />
Addon updates are spot on though. Not sure where people are making such a huge deal out of it. Ohh wait, yes I do, typical drama queen bullshit from MMOC forum monkeys.<br />
<br />
Does all addon functionality go away after the 23rd? Or just the &quot;Update All&quot; feature? <br />
<br />
Is there anything else that easily handles addons for free?</div></div><hr />
