HearthPwn - Hearthstone Database, Tools, and News<br />
As we get closer to the Hearthstone Beta and news happen more frequently, now is a good time to announce HearthPwn (http://www.hearthpwn.com/), our sister site for Hearthstone news! You will find much more frequent Hearthstone news updates there, along with the cards database (http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards), deck builder (http://www.hearthpwn.com/deckbuilder), and decks database (http://www.hearthpwn.com/decks). <br />
<br />
You can participate in the discussion on the HearthPwn Forums (http://www.hearthpwn.com/forums) or on our Hearthstone forum (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/344-Hearthstone-Heroes-of-Warcraft-Online-Cardgame)!<br />

<br />
Card Database<br />
Take a look at all of the previously unseen cards in the Card Database (http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards)!<br />
<br />
<br />
Every Card - Every Hearthstone card found in the game as of the current build is listed, except for the placeholder cards that we have hidden and two that will be revealed by Blizzard next week. <br />
Many Views - There are three different ways to browse cards:<br />
<br />
Visual (http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards) - View both the picture and all the card information in text form. Gives all the information you could need about the card (including if it can be gold).<br />
Images (http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards?display=3) - View every card in picture form (Great for looking at all the art)<br />
Listing (http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards?display=1) - Simply lists the name, and basic stats. Great for quick browsing.<br />
<br />
Filters - We have a filter for every class, type, and attribute there is. We also list the set names and more that you will only find on HearthPwn.<br />
Artist Names - The database also has the name of the artist for each and every card.<br />
Card Flavor Text - Many cards (http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/303-alexstrasza) have flavor text, such as &quot;Alexstrasza was enslaved by the orc Nekros Skullcrusher just before the Second War. When she was freed, she swallowed him whole. Yum!&quot;<br />
See Decks That Include Your Favorite Cards - Every card page has both a graph showing how many decks hold that card, along with links to every deck that has that card in it. Find a new fun card, and instantly find decks based off it!<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Deck Builder<br />
Build your deck (http://www.hearthpwn.com/deckbuilder) using the current cards available in Hearthstone!<br />
<br />
<br />
Every Card - Hearthpwn's deck builder (http://www.hearthpwn.com/deckbuilder) is the only deck builder around with EVERY card that Hearthstone has! <br />
Save, Share, and Vote - Once you have finished your deck, you can save it with a name and description. Players can now browse over decks on our deck database (http://www.hearthpwn.com/decks), vote on them, and even copy the deck over and work on their own version.<br />
Easy to Share on Forums - HearthPwn makes it easy for you to share your deck on the HearthPwn forums (http://www.hearthpwn.com/forums). Simply copy the Deck BBcode and your deck will automatically be outputted for easy viewing.<br />
More to Come - Keep in mind this is only the first version. There are many tweaks and additions in the works, such as sharing your decks on Facebook, info graphs, and more! <br />

<br />
<br />
Foil / Gold Card List<br />
Some cards will have a chance to have a gold border that improves the visual, but doesn't make the card more powerful. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MrExcelion</div><div class="date">2013-05-24, 03:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A website for this should be especially helpful, though it might just work better in wiki form if there's not enough news. I think there's already a couple of wikis out there though, would imagine Curse owns one of them. Hearthpwn is kind of an appropriate name considering it's mostly a &quot;PVP&quot; game. I was a hardcore Yu-Gi-Oh! player back in the day and I think I might have used the word pwned more than a handful of times during matches.<br />
<br />
The logo does need a rework. Saw hearthporn at first too.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">The Ogdru Jahad</div><div class="date">2013-05-24, 03:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the W in pwn looks like a combination of the drunk octopus hook + disney font, together they create Hearthporn. Honestly, change the name, terrible logo too.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmocad89a0a4d0</div><div class="date">2013-05-24, 03:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So having all that info in a place will be helpful to people, so that's a positive aspect. The name of the site and logo... oh well... you still have time to sort that out, I guess.<br />
The game itself seems way too linear and simple... seems that skill will have a very low % of importance and it will be more about what deck you have plus being lucky on drawing the right cards. So I guess it will be more appealing to people that never played tcg's before since the rules are very straight forward. I think the Forge may be a bit more interesting because there you have the decision factor that is what normally made drafts and sealed deck events so popular in other tcg's. I will still try it and help on beta if I get in just to have a breath of fresh air from other games.<br />
For someone that spoke before about MGT/YU-GI-OH combo with other games, the only card game I see being similar and having the same degree of difficulty with hard rules like in MGT will probably be Hex... so for people that like harder stuff you can keep an eye in that game, I think beta may come in the end of this year.</div></div><hr />

Also All the data you got must be from data mining the alpha client if so there may also be a NDA out and if you didn't get a OK from blizzard they will shut it down.<br />
<br />
Really should check and see if there is a NDA out as most Alpha builds and Close Beta's have one.</div></div><hr />

Well, I was going to post a rough sketch example that I did to show you what I mean, but I haven't posted enough times.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lanerios</div><div class="date">2013-05-24, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The name is just laughable really.. <br />
<br />
pwn? Do you cater to 12 year olds now?<br />
and the porn resemblance etc I won't go there, been said enough times.<br />
<br />
And to state the obvious, if it will become such a piece of junk as that wowhead wannabe site that curse has now, it will not be used very long</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have a dedicated sub section.<br />
<br />
SWTOR stuff was not allowed to be on homepage, Diablo neither.<br />
And both of those are actually MMOs. <br />
<br />
Hearthshit is not an mmo. <br />
Keep it off the front page please. We know you get some money from blizz for doing it, but, like build another site called Cards-champion dot com or something</div></div><hr />

<br />
Diablo is not a MMO, and it was featured on the front page more than once, a lot more than Hearthstone.<br />
<br />
And you just wrote an entire comment to complain about how we could create a dedicated hearthstone website instead of posting stuff on MMO-Champion, then you posted that comment in the news where I announce the dedicated Hearthstone website we're releasing to stop having to post stuff on MMO-Champion.</div></div><hr />
