<br />
Hey again—Chris Robinson here with a new Artcraft, and today we’re showing off the female and male Troll models. We’re wrapping up work on both of their models, and we thought it’d be cool for you to see them side-by-side. Showing both genders together gives you a more cohesive visual story and a more complete picture of the Trolls’ character, who they are, and where they come from.<br />
<br />
One of the unique challenges for the Troll models were their tusks. In the character customization options, you have the ability to select from a number of tusk “styles.” While other race models (like the Tauren) have similar customization options, the additional modeling, texturing, and animation articulation of the Troll face—and mouth especially—made this a distinctive challenge. We actually had to model the Troll with a flat lower lip; then, for each facial customization option, we went in and posed their lips to naturally wrap around each tusk option.<br />
<br />
We hope you enjoyed this quick look at the male and female Trolls, and we’ll see you in the next Artcraft!</div></div><hr />

The male's chest don't look like they have anywhere near the same quality of shading or muscle definition or texture that has been on the others. The face looks far more developed and certain parts of it look a lot smoother, but it definitely looks like a work in progress.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know I'm coming off as very intolerant, but what a waste of time. They might as well have left the old model, frankly there's hardly any real improvement. Yeah, it looks smoother. Hurray.<br />
<br />
Edit: And I'll invite you all to admire the update Male Troll's blocky calves. Pathetic. the 2004 calves actually look better, and this is no exaggeration.<br />
<br />
There's definitely something wrong with the body. I'm not buying this. While the hands look good, the feet are a joke as well. The underwear looks super low res. This looks miles away from the level of polish we got with Tauren or Dwarf. Imo something's off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's called being a cynic and they have magic pills for that. But seriously, different modelers may work on different parts. It makes sense that different parts may be at different degrees of completion even if its the same artist. It is a work in progress after all, so you sound silly in saying its looks incomplete, lol.</div></div><hr />

If you compare the hair texture of the male dwarfs with the hair texture of the trolls you can see the difference. especially the braided hair and the bands holding them. <br />

And... the Skin textures seems very low quality compare to the other models that have already been updated.</div></div><hr />

They said their intention was to update the player character models and maintain the look and feel of them while increasing the quality and that's exactly what they did. Those of you who expected them to look like the ToT Zandalari trolls obviously had no idea what their goals were with this update. They didn't set out to radically change the models like they would have had to do so to make them look like the Zandalari trolls. They did what they said they were going to do which was take the current models, up their detail/polygon count, and fully animate the faces. <br />
<br />
Personally I think they look amazing.</div></div><hr />

Before I scroll to the next page I just wanted to take a moment to agree with you. I'm not sure if my comment went through originally but I don't even know if this is an actual model so much as just a photoshopped picture of the original or something. It looks halfway finished to me compared to Vol'jin or any of the other new models. The chest doesn't have a whole lot of shading or texture or muscle definition or anything, and the coloration just looks kind of washed out. It's like they just threw this together in 5 minutes with a 3 paragraph blue post because they knew they mentioned they were going to make a troll artcraft and figured they better get something out.<br />
<br />
I'm expecting it to be a work in progress. But you can definitely tell certain models have had a lot more care put into them. This model as well as the Draenei, or at least Draenei male, both look like they were just kind of thrown together last minute to me. The female model looks fine though. Aside from the warts but I imagine that's an option and not mandatory.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I think the same, honestly the first four models they presented looked so amazing, and so much of an upgrade compared to the ones that came after that, but a lot the other ones looked a bit underwhelming.</div></div><hr />

All the faces I've seen have been laughably similar to me. You can see minor details here and there but it's still the same face and structure.

I agree, this looks like a rush job. Blood Elf players, be THANKFUL that your models won't be released until after WoD goes live.<br />

Vol'jin looks amazing, was hoping for female trolls to look more like Mar'li's model from ToT but I guess that's not what's happening here...lol. Oh well, lots of pretty races to choose from. <br />

Don't think the trolls look bad per se, but could have been better imo. <br />

Even after they addressed it, the differences are minor. You have to really look closely to see the differences and often it's just a slightly opened mouth and more wrinkles. I think it's the best they can do with these faces and I honestly didn't expect more. I doubt the Troll females will now have pretty face option that does the original one justice but we'll see soon enough. That might also have been the reason why all the faces in the artcraft were ugly ones.</div></div><hr />

It is a work in progress after all, so you sound silly in saying its looks incomplete, lol.<br />
<br />
<br />
What really sounds silly is all the people on these forums constantly telling other people they sound silly. Are we in kindergarten?<br />
<br />
I don't know why that annoys me so much. ANYway.<br />
<br />
Hypothetical situation. Blizzard unveils a partially done model but there are a certain percentage of players who don't like certain aspects of it? Another percentage that gets heard more loudly is praising every aspect of it whether it is finished or not. They decide their work is done and leave the model the way it is considering it a victory. <br />
<br />
Expressing a negative opinion about something and critiquing something, despite what you may think, does not mean that I'm hunting these developers down with hatemail and telling them they should quit life.<br />

<br />
Ears on the males look rather lacking and flat, tusk texture looks a bit plain.<br />
<br />
The lack of hint of any form of fur(Which Jungle Trolls have, however short), I can sort of understand, but they just look very shiny skinned.</div></div><hr />

Horde<br />
&quot;Pretty face&quot;<br />
Troll<br />
Does not compute...<br />
<br />
I thought the Horde always rallied behind being the &quot;monster&quot; race of badasses, not being pretty. Except the blood elves, but, y'know...blood elves.<br />
<br />
Well they gave troll females one &quot;pretty&quot; face option back then, because they wanted them to look more brutish and ugly but also knew that people generally would tend more towards the prettier ones, especially females. Similarly orc females have one face I find rather pretty, while the rest looks terrible and dwarf females also.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But female troll looks awesome! I can't wait to see their animations. :)<br />
<br />
I think it's the coloration! Or the lack of shading. If you look at Vol'jin his textures just look far more crisp and there is more contrast in the coloring, especially the warpaint on his face.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping they're still working on it, but it kind of just looks like a solid color with better bone structure and no real life to it. It doesn't really seem like skin, at least not to the same quality as some of the other races.</div></div><hr />

A complete revamp in the direction of voljin would have been much better, this is just... I don't know what I'm looking at abasketballplayeraleinwithhappyfaceanddeformedtusks, I'm guessing the tabard still leans to the left side like it currently does live too.<br />
<br />
Edit: I can't imagine anyone not liking the voljin modle or you know, something like the one in w3 ? This just seems rushed which sucks because i doubt they're reupdating any character models anytime soon, cuz you know... We'll lose about 10 playable races 4 expansions and about 15 tiers worth of raiding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In all honestly, I'm liking them more and more the longer I look at them. The male troll stands better and their expressions are looking good, all while keeping almost exactly to the old model. And the female troll just looks dead on to me. Admittedly, some of the textures could have been done a little better.</div></div><hr />

I wanted to be excited but, compared to the other models, it just doesn't look as done? It seems a bit rushed. The face looks much better sure, but the body is just, eh... <br />
<br />
I didn't expect them to be brolic and beefy like Vol'jin, but I mean at least be similar and shading and texture. It just doesn't look smooth. So disappointed =[. Compared to the other finely tuned models such as the taurens, humans and dwarves, it's just so blah.<br />
<br />
I personally feel this the worst model that has been updated. It sucks too because out of all the models, this is one of the races that desperately needed an update, second to female taurens.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, i saw it too. H... how? Why? What were they thinking? What purpose does it serve?<br />
<br />
Trolls are a semi-arboreal race, known in the lore for their ability to climb almost anything. They can climb cliff faces without rope, at speeds much faster than Orcs with ropes. They have been noted to be able to skitter across cavern walls like spiders when they were so inclined. They travel through trees in near silence.<br />
<br />
I would say they have that back toe because it helps them grip surfaces with their feet, and climb better.</div></div><hr />

Stop looking at that because A.) every race still has some kind of semi-jagged part and B.) it's not bad and you're only seeing it from one front angle in that picture. They can't make everything perfectly round, most games can't. Too many polys.</div></div><hr />

If you expect something they never talked about, then you'll be disappointed.<br />
The new models were supposed to be an updated version of the old ones, meaning that they are the same, but HD... So no posture change, no drastic appearance change. I mean, playing the beta, and after the live game, I sometimes have trouble to distinguish which is the live and which is the beta, the races are in every way similar to the old ones, but better looking, that's all, and that's what they intended.<br />
<br />
So stop expecting something that isn't supposed to happen, if you don't want to be disappointed.</div></div><hr />

You and the person you quoted severely misunderstand the point some posters are making here. It's not all about the warts and stuff, I personally don't mind them, Trolls are traditionally savage and wild, living in very primitive environments. The issue I feel is how little work looks to have been done compared to the other races. The face looks great, they did a great job on the tusks and mouth. However the rest of the body, at least for the male Trolls, looks bland. It's just there, it doesn't look as smooth as the other races or even Vol'jin himself.<br />
<br />
<br />
The fact that they're still a work in progress should speak volumes here. Other than that, I can'd imagine how they could have done them any differently without making them a completely different troll race...<br />
<br />
Jesus... you keep making the same dumb point about how it's not about making a new race. After reading the entire thread, NO ONE has said otherwise. Everyone is aware of the philosophy Blizzard chose which was to spruce up the old and keeping their identity. All you need to do is look at Vol'jin's model, it is refined, textured nicely and keeps the savage look of the Trolls. Compare the old Human Male Model to the new, they are worlds apart while keeping the feel of humans. Work in progress or not, the models that have been released look so clean and new, very updated and fresh. When you look at the Troll, it's nice sure, but it doesn't seem as polished. It's updates look bland compared to the other races. It's just not all there. It just doesn't look like male trolls had as much work done.<br />
<br />
Aside from all that, the female Troll looks vastly different and it's a great chance. I don't mind the warts and such, it fits a race that is more primitive than the orcs or tauren.</div></div><hr />

These are the best remakes yet, next to the Orcs.<br />
<br />
I know right? It's as if the characters, especially female ones, can only be ugly and fierce if they are ugly and fierce in the same way as those Avatar creatures...they look different, but in essence they have perfekt skin, hair and pretty faces. Trolls are savage, not into high fashion and make-up.</div></div><hr />

Warts are a weird cosmetic choice for the women. This isn't just an HD effect really, this is trying to add something that didn't originally exist. Also, they look WAY meaner.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's because none of the previous reveals had any facial posturing beyond dead and soulless. That's obviously already been done here, and was necessary to get the tusks and lips to work properly, anyway.<br />
<br />
I think this Artcraft has shown off the best 1:1 remodel thus far, not that 1:1 was necessarily a good idea for other races, but it is pretty stunning looking at the face comparisons. The only nitpick I have is that jungle trolls are supposed to have a fine layer of fur and Blizz seems to have forgotten this. Whether the fine fur is supposed to be akin to body hair, peach fuzz or felt-like or whatever hasn't even been said, but it's always been absent.</div></div><hr />

The new models were supposed to be an updated version of the old ones, meaning that they are the same, but HD... So no posture change, no drastic appearance change.

Apart from that, the new models look exactly as I had hoped. Yes, I'm HAPPY with them and not worried. I know that it's a bit of a taboo here to be positive, but I am. You people can complain and dread until the cows come home for all I care, really.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has some trouble with design of female characters in general. Maybe its time to hire more women into the staff?<br />

Why the hell should they prettify females of races that aren't MEANT to be mainstream pretty to humans? You have pretty races to choose from. To me she looks absolutely stunning and captures the spirit of the trolls perfectly.</div></div><hr />

I know a lot of people like &quot;that one troll face&quot; that looks pretty, and I hope it still floats their boat after update, but it seems so character-less, as most of the old faces do. Now female trolls have personality and it looks really good to me.</div></div><hr />

As for female..they're PHENOMENAL!! The eyes are re-done perfectly, the booty looks like a real woman's bottom, and their face seems to have a wide-ranging emotional scale. Not overly fond of the facial warts - hopefully that is an option a la Undead facial features.</div></div><hr />

I don't recall hearing anything about ALL troll's being a bit furry, only some of them. Even then it was a fine layer of &quot;fur&quot; and honestly if you want something with fur on it perhaps you should be playing one of the furry races? Not to sound like an ass here, but the Draenei got their fur removed too so if one is going to get a revise over a minor unimportant detail that is going to be covered by armor then both need it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's a difference between crouching and being hunchback. And if this were done for that reason, then why do the females have such great posture? The night elves are pretty stealthy as well. Troll hunchbacks look more lazy and laid back than stealthy. Personally I prefer them upright for their default posture because for that few seconds when they do stand up straight, they look more intimidating than an orc.</div></div><hr />

On topic: These new models are fairly underwhelming. The poly count on the male body looks low compared to the other races; his legs are especially blocky. The male troll's textures are also severely lacking in fidelity; the veins on the arms of the original model are actually less blurred than on the new model. The female model isn't too bad but her face is far too goblin-like when she snarls or looks angry. As for the warts, they seem like a cheap attempt to add detail to the textures instead of going the more work-intensive route of layering pores, dirt, etc. They detract from the look of the models IMO, particularly because they weren't there in the originals.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really wish we'd be able to pick a sub-race already. Zandalari trolls look so much better.<br />
<br />
At the old res, warts wouldn't have looked right. New res allows the small bumps in the skin. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure what the wart-haters are getting worked up about though... these moles are subtle skin tones, small, and likely to be about 90% covered by armor. Its not like they are big red festering pimples or cysts (which would easily be more troll-like in most fantasy lore). Lighten up folks--you rolled trolls, not elves.</div></div><hr />

Weak. So, so god damn weak. They update Vol'jin, and give us this? Jesus Christ. Look at Vol'jin. Then look at this. Is it too much to ask for a playable toon to look as good as an NPC?<br />
<br />
I know I'm coming off as very intolerant, but what a waste of time. They might as well have left the old model, frankly there's hardly any real improvement. Yeah, it looks smoother. Hurray.<br />
<br />
Edit: And I'll invite you all to admire the update Male Troll's blocky calves. Pathetic. the 2004 calves actually look better, and this is no exaggeration.<br />
<br />
There's definitely something wrong with the body. I'm not buying this. While the hands look good, the feet are a joke as well. The underwear looks super low res. This looks miles away from the level of polish we got with Tauren or Dwarf. Imo something's off.<br />
agree, voljin looks 1 million times better.</div></div><hr />

Won't happen unless they introduce new trolls, since people will be butthurt if they change their toons too much. Not all trolls are the same either, these are jungle trolls ;P wtb Ice trolls and Zadalari trolls.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It means for the first time, Blizzard did EXACTLY what they said, the trolls are completely like your current model, but updated.<br />
<br />
But then again, I feel a bit disappointed because I was looking for the wow factor since I play one... now I wonder if they will finally have boots.</div></div><hr />

That's the whole point. They don't want to change too much, so as not to alienate people who are attached to the way their character looks.<br />
<br />
Plus it's a lot more than &quot;more polygons&quot;. There's all that extra animation, too.</div></div><hr />

yep but still its super disappointing as i was expecting something more, actual improvements, like orcs / undead<br />
<br />
stuffs that have changed over the last decade were way beyond just polygons / HD skins, theres so much they can revisit</div></div><hr />

<br />
The gnome male faces look just as different as the originals. 0<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
All the faces I've seen have been laughably similar to me. You can see minor details here and there but it's still the same face and structure. At least of the few I've seen on here I had to look REALLLLYYY closely to spot the difference. Perhaps the angle too of the screenshots too. Idk.<br />
<br />
You must be looking at the old ones. Some of the new faces actually alter bone structure and the default resting position. If you turn a model side ways and clink through the faces you can see the nose and cheekbones/mouth changing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
except, as usual, its a completely new model, new textures and new skeleton. Built to resemble our existing characters because NO ONE wants their characters turned into something completely different. Your &quot;noticing a trend of just throwing more polygons onto the old model&quot; is bulshit. because its not the old model, its not the old skeleton and there has been NO trend. Except for the sentence you just made up to fill in empty space.<br />
<br />
The trolls are the most successful model in accomplishing this. I can't wait to see them animated and moving.<br />
<br />
not to mention the troll faces, thanks to all those bones, are much more dynamic and expressive, as are their movements and actions. which we will get to see in all their glory in the video update.</div></div><hr />

That face on the full length picture of the male is the one I use and the new one does look quite a bit different. I think it's the smaller iris/pupils... he looks meaner now.

youre using the &quot;pretty&quot; face anyway so why does it matter?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly, I'm using the pretty face because I don't like the 'ugly face', all Trolls are 'ugly' some just don't really look it because of shitty 2002 graphics. The core concept for Trolls is 'Ugly' so even the less 'ugly' models will still be 'ugly' due to new graphics. It's the whole reason I can't really be mad, I got away with like 6 or 7 years of 'pretty' Troll.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Make the calves a touch larger and the ankles slightly wider and you won't have to change the feet much then, will actually look like proper troll legs<br />

Hair also looks rubbish and sticky taped on. Shame could have been amazing, dissapointed</div></div><hr />
