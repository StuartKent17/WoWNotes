BlizzCon 2015 Online Merchandise Sale Begins<br />
The BlizzCon® 2015 online merchandise sale has begun! Beginning today, October 16 through November 8, BlizzCon attendees and Virtual Ticket holders have access to a treasure trove of BlizzCon-premiere loot through the Blizzard Gear Store (http://gear.blizzard.com/). The virtual aisles are loaded with new items debuting at the show, along with some BlizzCon classics—visit the BlizzCon section of the Gear Store to check out what our master crafters have worked up.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/FZ4wnmNpZpk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
To access the BlizzCon sale, simply head to the Blizzard Gear Store (gear.blizzard.com (http://gear.blizzard.com/)), and log in using the Battle.net account you used to purchase your Virtual Ticket. Each of this year’s BlizzCon-premiere products will be marked with a BlizzCon logo.<br />
<br />
If you’re attending BlizzCon in person, use the account on which you redeemed the BlizzCon Digital Bonuses code sent to you via email earlier this year. If a friend bought your ticket for you, ask them for your code—remember, it also grants you a Virtual Ticket and this year’s in-game goodies (http://us.battle.net/blizzcon/en/blog/19888091/blizzcon-2015-in-game-goodies-round-up-9-21-2015)—and head to www.battle.net/code (http://www.battle.net/code) to redeem it.<br />

<br />
Supplies are limited, so if you spot anything you like, make sure to order early. All orders will be shipped upon receipt—so the sooner you order, the faster you’ll get your BlizzCon swag. Keep in mind that orders are shipped from the United States, so international shipping rates may apply. We’ll also be adding new items once BlizzCon gets underway on November 6, so be sure to check back in then.<br />
<br />
Happy hunting!<br />

Blue Posts<br />
The Infinite Timereaver from Timewalking.<br />
Isn't all the loot in TW dungeons personal anyway? So I guess that the mount will be the same.<br />
This is correct. The Infinite Timereaver will be awarded via Personal Loot. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/390414-the-infinite-timereaver-from-timewalking/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16203140637?page=1#10))<br />
<br />
GMs Appearing in Game<br />
This is a request we see crop-up from time to time. While I do appreciate that it sounds cool for a Game Master (GM) to appear in a capital city and spawn something, this would also be a very disruptive event that could ruin the gameplay experience for others. It would also somehwat break the immersion of the game if Hydross, for example, suddenly appeared in Stormwind. There is also only a finite amount of times such an event can be done before it starts being perceived as an annoyance, or loses its significance.<br />
<br />
This is why such events are normally used to celebrate the end of Beta and the shut-down of the Beta servers; a fun once-off event that doesn't affect the live Realms in any form, but signifies the destruction of the Beta world and makes for some cool videos and screenshots. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/390330-gm-in-sw-org-fun/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16203580609?page=1#8))<br />

So what software do you guys use for animation?<br />
maya for animation (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/651608813137604609))<br />
<br />
Having more LAN events outside of Blizzcon, is that something you guys have been thinking about for wow esports?<br />
We're primarily focused on Blizzcon and the Road to Blizzcon. If a major event wanted to add WoW to their schedule, we'd love it. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/651791753679273985))<br />
<br />
When you can't fail, everything matters less. Some reflections (https://pretensionsofwisdom.wordpress.com/2015/09/29/designing-failure-the-value-of-failing/) on the value of death penalties in games. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/652166006895284225))<br />
. its why not alot of people play hardcore or do wow iron man<br />
Yeah, those are definitely some of the trade-offs. A more engaged audience perhaps, but typically a smaller one. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/652177537775202304))<br />
I'm planning on making a couple more posts on the subject that tap into the areas between the 2 extremes. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/652177895167688704))<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Majority rule isn't always great for design either. Cell phone customers always just ask for more battery life not features.<br />
Still not a good idea to tell customers &quot;The battery life is fine. Here's a bunch of features you didn't ask for.&quot;<br />
I'm hardly a cellphone historian but I don't remember users asking for a camera, map and music on their phones. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/651602712904118272))<br />

Michele Morrow (@michelemorrow (http://www.twitter.com/michelemorrow))<br />
<br />
Actress, undead hunter, and voice of Alleria Windrunner (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Lo1AgtZ-A) Michele Morrow returns to co-anchor the show from the DIRECTV desk this year, where she’ll be conducting interviews and providing commentary in between the panels and other activities on the main stage both days of the show. Michele hosted Heroes of the Dorm, which aired on ESPN2, and made her BlizzCon debut in 2014—we’re thrilled to have her back!<br />

Alex Albrecht (@alexalbrecht (http://www.twitter.com/alexalbrecht))<br />
<br />
Joining Michele this year at the DIRECTV desk is Alex Albrecht, host of popular geek-culture TV shows like G4’s The Screen Savers, creator of the World of Warcraft podcast and website Project Lore, and 50% of the Half Hour Happy Hour podcast. In between BlizzCon co-anchoring gigs, look for him hanging out in the Nexus.<br />

Wil Wheaton (@wilw (http://www.twitter.com/wilw))<br />
<br />
In case you missed the announcement earlier: Wil Wheaton will be hosting this year’s BlizzCon costume and talent contests on Friday night! Wil is the author of books like Just a Geek, the creator of the popular board-gaming show TableTop, a prolific podcaster, and much more. He also blogs a bunch at www.wilwheaton.net (http://www.wilwheaton.net/)—check out his recent entry (http://wilwheaton.net/2015/10/stay-awhile-and-listen/) on gearing up for BlizzCon.<br />
<br />
The action begins November 6 and 7, and you can pick up a Virtual Ticket (https://us.battle.net/shop/en/product/blizzcon-virtual-ticket) now to be a part of it. We’ll also have plenty of eSports action throughout the show, and we’ve got some awesome hosts and casters lined up for this year’s tournaments—stay tuned for more details. We hope you can join us! <br />

Crithto Joins GUNNAR<br />
Crithto left Blizzard (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5183-Crithto-Leaves-Blizzard-Apexis-Crystal-Bonus-Event-Tweets-Con-Before-The-Storm) last week and we know where he ended up now!

<br />
Sort of like.. Instant travel? Or did you mean like the lfg tool? No? Perhaps you meant like Instancing. If none of the above I can only assume you meant the game being designed to play in 3rd person.<br />
<br />
A gm appearing? Absolutely trivial compared to any and all of the above. Wow has 0 immersion and is one of the biggest reasons it doesn't register as being an mmorpg on my radar. Mmomoba perhaps.</div></div><hr />

That is like saying, &quot;Well if you don't agree with X then you also do not agree with Y and the rest o Z.&quot; It is disingenuous at best, downright disgusting at worst. People don't like him because he says some stupid things about gamers as a whole, yet he still interjects into gaming culture where ever he can. This is the same person who praised his producer then literally 3 days later threw his producer under the bus.<br />

Wil is just an all around bad person and I would rather someone else be the talent host. With all of this said, as long as he does not interject any of his politics into his session, and as long as he does not attempt to shame people based on his politics, and as long as he does not release a, &quot;MISOGYNIST IS SUCH A PROBLEM AT BLIZZCON&quot; article after blizzcon, then it's okay i guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am rather nervous he will be seen in ALL of the online shows now. I can not stand this human and ...frankly if I had warning that the live stream would be pretty much run by this guy, I would ask for my money back.<br />
<br />
I have hope though....not sure why.<br />

That is like saying, &quot;Well if you don't agree with X then you also do not agree with Y and the rest o Z.&quot; It is disingenuous at best, downright disgusting at worst. People don't like him because he says some stupid things about gamers as a whole, yet he still interjects into gaming culture where ever he can. This is the same person who praised his producer then literally 3 days later threw his producer under the bus.<br />

Nah, I really just do not like him as a person, being unfortunate enough to move in enough circles where I end up hearing his &quot;thoughts and ideas&quot; just doesn't help at all.<br />
The whole idea put out that if I don't like WW then I don't like ...whoever is , grade school logic at it's finest. Blizzard doesn't put out it's political,social agendas on twitter (I do not follow individuals...)so i would not know if Mike is a crusading SJW douche canoe or not.<br />
<br />
Even if he was, I still like the game, WW has nothing to do with producing the game...<br />

That's your opinion of him and you are entitled to it i guess but it doesn't make it correct and after Mike's speech last year, the general issues with &quot;gamergate&quot; politics in general, and the fact that Blizzard hired him, i think their position on Will and his politics are pretty clear which means their politics are pretty clear. People don't have to agree with that but if they don't, there's no reason to endlessly snark on it it at this point. You should also consider whether you really, really, want to be against the side that wants inclusion and equality in gaming.<br />

Mike gave a pretty big speech about it last year at blizzcon actually. It was news and he spoke out pretty directly against online harrassment, exclusion, and bullying.</div></div><hr />

While I do appreciate that it sounds cool for a Game Master (GM) to appear in a capital city and spawn something, this would also be a very disruptive event that could ruin the gameplay experience for others.&quot;<br />
<br />
Why does our society always cater to the &quot;others&quot; now? Oh we can't do that, it might offend those who get offended, or disrupt those who hate being disrupted. This is why this game sucks now, they catered to the cry babies and look where it got them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What would be the point of knowingly disrupting the entertainment of paying customers and fellow players? You can look at many of the wow events to see that while they are memorable, not everyone remembers them for the same reasons. I was literally just listening to 5 people in my raid talking about how the Wrath zombie event was so disruptive that they couldn't even do their raids at the end because people kept bringing in zombie infections. They were still unhappy about it 8 years later.<br />
<br />
Yes, maybe its a little silly to still feel so strongly about it after all this time but they do so that's why Blizzard isn't running around spawning Kel'Thuzad in Ironforge or something.</div></div><hr />

All true, but you have to consider the type of people that are drawn to this website. For example, the #gamergate thread has been reopened multiple times even after long periods of inactivity and inappropriate comments which would cause any other thread to be permanently closed. It is still used regularly to attack female game developers, often about their physical appearance and sexual activity.<br />
<br />
Again, these are the type of people who have been drawn to this website, so of course you're going to hear a lot of whining and crying here when Blizzard brings in someone like Wil Wheaton for Blizzcon. I have a feeling the actual crowd attending will be more supportive and inclusive in general.</div></div><hr />

<br />
as someone that sits at a PC for 12 hr shifts for work, they work wonders.... I ordered a pair as a deal of the day, and never looked back, got a second pair for at home use. I don't use them as much at home but i'm not reading as much text at home either vs work. I can vouch for them making a difference though. (also if you don't need a prescription the cost is reasonable)<br />
<br />
That said it is a odd move, musta been a big pay increase or something behind the scenes.</div></div><hr />

This is a request we see crop-up from time to time. While I do appreciate that it sounds cool for a Game Master (GM) to appear in a capital city and spawn something, this would also be a very disruptive event that could ruin the gameplay experience for others. It would also somehwat break the immersion of the game if Hydross, for example, suddenly appeared in Stormwind. There is also only a finite amount of times such an event can be done before it starts being perceived as an annoyance, or loses its significance.<br />
<br />
This is why such events are normally used to celebrate the end of Beta and the shut-down of the Beta servers; a fun once-off event that doesn't affect the live Realms in any form, but signifies the destruction of the Beta world and makes for some cool videos and screenshots. (Blue Tracker / Official Forums)<br />
<br />
This is so sad, that either <br />
<br />
A) blizzard is clueless, anyone I talk to have either experienced it, or heard of it and its all positive, not just spawning something in the city but in random places (theres a cracking ICC 10 video where a gm appears) they could do loads of fun stuff, <br />
B) The player base have become boring little shits if they don't enjoy something like that, I mean look c'mon how many people waste time in cities it'd be something different</div></div><hr />

The majority of people is neutral in the GG issue or has not even heard of it. The majority will be supportive, not because they have an opionion, but precisely because they have none. That is a not even an argument. <br />
<br />
Funny how you bring up the GG thread and the misbehaviour of individuals in that thread, whose allegiances or motives are most often anyones guess. Surely their behaviour is an issue, but here is the kicker: No one who shitposted there is invited to host a contest show at blizzcon, riding the waves of their controversy. But when it comes to Wheatons actual, verifiable statements and actions you deny, deflect and misdirect.</div></div><hr />

I would suspect a large majority of the attendees have no clue what gamergate is beyond a vague reference or two - and more importantly, don't care. Gamergate is not mainstream, it's a toxic subset of gaming most people are ignorant of.</div></div><hr />
