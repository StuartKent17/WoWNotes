Patch 8.1.5 PTR - Island Expedition BoA Gear Tokens<br />
The Seafarer's Dubloon vendors (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/8099-Seafarer-s-Doubloon-Vendors-Diablo-3-BlizzCon-Reward-MDI-All-Stars-at-BlizzCon?page=) now sell several bind on account gear tokens for 20 x Seafarer's Dubloons (https://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1710-seafarers-dubloon) each. These can be used or mailed to alts that are Level 111+. <br />
<br />
These work much like the gear tokens from Tanaan Jungle and Argus, providing a piece of gear appropriate for the level of the character that utilizes it. The item level starts at 214 for level 111's and increases up to 282 for a level 120. The tokens can proc higher item levels, much like previous iterations.<br />

It's like not like they can completely scrap IE's mid expac sadly. T.T<br />
SO we are stuck with IE's until the end of this expac. I don't mind them honestly, they are great for lvlin new Bfa toons.</div></div><hr />

Broken Shore and Tanaan came in the x.2 patches. Argus came in the x.3 patch. <br />
<br />
It's only 8.1.5, with Nazjatar coming in 8.2. A zone similar to the size of Argus, by the way. <br />
<br />
Quit grasping at straws and complaining at the wrong shit. You look ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

I was thinking the same thing. 282 ilvl gear? That's barely higher than the gear that you finish questing in...Its got to be a typo, maybe 382 ilvl? But then you're barely below normal raid ilvl so I really don't know...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Never. The patch tomorrow is going to be such a shit show of a disappointment that Activision will burn down the Blizzard servers. With their cash cow slain they will allow themselves to be bought out by EA. The executives will be given generous severance packages while all non executive employees will be executed in the streets. Their organs harvested and transplanted into the elites of EA, to ensure their continued survival as they seek to become the only game publisher in the world. LONG LIVE EA AND MOBILE GAMING! MICRO TRANSACTIONS TODAY! MICRO TRANSACTIONS FOREVER!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Piesor</div><div class="date">2019-03-05, 07:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So..... there already exist lvl120 heirlooms at this point. And now they add basically green questing gear for 20 dubloons each? Who can benefit from this? I am quite confident that a mainchar that holds hundreds of dubloons may also afford heirlooms.This is totally retarded ....<br />
<br />
Imo a solution could be to make those items work as catchup gear. It would would be great if a char leveled through IE could afford a set of this gear when reaching lvl120. They could make it ilvl340 so you may continue to gear up towards the current content through WQs, Heroics, Mythics .....</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mootlix</div><div class="date">2019-03-05, 07:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What is the point of those BoA's. At 111 the crafted greens have a higher ilvl(225 and 233 for blues), and at 120 you can make crafted 340's? And normals give 340 loot.<br />
And comparing them to argus/tanaan? Those items where a catch up for alts/people who where behind in gear and where for max level anyway. <br />
Who is going to waste dubloons on these when the grind to the albatross is so long and there is plenty of other stuff to blow them on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) they are relatively expensive<br />
<br />
2) they are relatively weak<br />
<br />
3) most importantly, they are apparently just quest reward stuff, not even models that come from the islands, so it's not even a way to target Island drops like I initially thought.<br />
<br />
So, no need to buy them for me. Heirlooms will be fine.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Puri</div><div class="date">2019-03-05, 09:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's way too expensive. On average you get 4 dubloons per expedition (with &quot;class hall&quot; trait to gain more). That means you have to do ~5 expeditions for a single item, not even talking about how people who are just getting their weekly done still need quite an amount to get the cosmetical items.</div></div><hr />

and i dont care much about gear while leveling, since itll be replaced fast when dinging 120.<br />
only people who i can imagine this gear could be of any use, is 111 twinks fishing for high ilvl procs, but thats a really niche part of the playerbase.<br />
and 20 tokens for one piece? thatll take like 10 islands to get, without the mission table upgrades. itll take like 1 hour to get 1 282, sounds good makes sense HAHAHA! even if it was 350+, it would still be a waste of time.<br />

<br />
We are not even half way through the expansion yet and you speak like this is the final patch of the expansion. Hell, what kind of argument are you trying to make here comparing Island Expedition content from a minor X.5 patch to new zones added in Major Content Patches???<br />
<br />
Broken Shore[7.2] would be the equivalent, patch cycle wise, to Nazjatar and Mechagon[8.2] Which are already looking to be far more content than the Broken Shore from what we know about it.<br />
<br />
Argus[7.3] and Tanaan[6.2], both the final &quot;content&quot; patches of the respective expansions, would be the equivalent of whatever we get for patch 8.3 which we have literally no idea what it will be.<br />
<br />
You argument/outrage is literally as flawed as it could possibly be as you are comparing content introduced at the start of the expansion that is being touched upon and expanded to new locations added via major content patches. I can't even grasp what point you are trying to make here. There are actual legitimate issues with BFA and yet you need to go out of your way to turn this into some sort of bizarre outrage?</div></div><hr />

If you've power leveld a low gear alt in IE's and dungeons, you'll be sat around 250 ilvl anyways come 120. Personally, I had quest gear and 5 TW 365 pieces people had traded me during leveling, mine came out at 286 IIRC as I hit 120.</div></div><hr />

Don't you get like ilvl 280-290 from quests at 119...? WQ start at 285 at 120 iirc as well.<br />

Yeah, and Timewalk vendor gear is super cheap -- 350s for a small number of badges. 365+ dropping in the dungeons themselves.<br />
<br />
I believe the Timewalks I did at 119 even had higher ilvl gear than 282.<br />

282 would have been alright for the very start of the xpac, but not now. Timewalking got upgraded, but these island figures are way behind the times.</div></div><hr />

This is for people that level by doing island expeditions. You will have a ton of dubloons by the time you hit max level.<br />
If you level by doing regular quests you will get better gear from those quests.<br />

No, you're the dumb one. If you don't like IE you don't do them and instead level by doing regular quests, which will give you better gear than those tokens give. Really don't understand what you're complaining about. You're probably just dumb.<br />

This is for people that level through IE so they fall far behind on gear. If you do quests you get the gear that way. It's not meant to give you the best gear and it's not meant to give better or equal gear to quests because they don't want IE to be the default way to level.<br />

Then they would have to increase the ilvl of the zone quests aswell. IE farming from level 110-120 should not be the better way to level than doing quests in a MMO.</div></div><hr />

lol even if you spam IE from 110-120 (eww? And who even does that anyway?) you can still go INSTANTLY do any available world quests and get better gear than that dubloom crap. Or you can go out and kill literally any rare mob in a warfront area. Or you can do dungeons. Or buy 310 gear for 150g. There are almost half a dozen outlets for gear available to fresh 120's that are so much better than whatever this dubloom gear is supposed to be. Maybe you should try understanding the system before you start calling other people dumb. <br />
<br />
I don't even get how you can enjoy IE enough to sit there and be triggered by negative feedback about it</div></div><hr />

There are almost half a dozen outlets for gear available to fresh 120's that are so much better than whatever this dubloom gear is supposed to be. Maybe you should try understanding the system before you start calling other people dumb. <br />
<br />
I don't even get how you can enjoy IE enough to sit there and be triggered by negative feedback about it<br />
Yeah, but the gear isn't intended to be for fresh 120s. It's meant to be for people who want to level entirely through islands and not be immediately pummeled into the dirt because they're a level 119 character wearing level 109 questing gear. That's why it scales to the player's level.<br />
<br />
With that said, it's still a horrible solution. If the prices are final you'd be lucky to get more than a couple pieces of gear from 110-120 if you leveled entirely through islands. That's not going to stop you from being pummeled into a fine mist. Not to mention you'd have to spread those pieces out through 10 levels, since the gear itself doesn't scale.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fair enough point, but even then all of my suggestions yield better gear and are still much easier to acquire. Buying 5-6 310 (or 340!) pieces of gear for less than 1k will always by far be the easiest method. This new gear is not needed nor wanted. Especially considering your last point about needing luck to get more than a couple of pieces by the time you finish leveling. <br />
<br />
This whole idea is kind of facepalm to me. How did this idea make it past its initial meeting that the dev that thought it up shared it? Do they not play their own game to understand the plethora of other (better) options already available in game? Should have just made them straight up heirlooms or struck the idea entirely imho.</div></div><hr />

If you've power leveld a low gear alt in IE's and dungeons, you'll be sat around 250 ilvl anyways come 120. Personally, I had quest gear and 5 TW 365 pieces people had traded me during leveling, mine came out at 286 IIRC as I hit 120.<br />

World quest rewards start at 315 and you can craft really cheap 340 gear.

I'm going to challenge that statement with my own experience of leveling alts most of which via island expeditions and below are the number of coins they each have by the time they hit 120. The 300+ one is my main. 20 is a safe number your average character can get if the coins drop for you often enough. <br />

<br />
No it's not, it's scaling gear from 111. On a freshly dinged 110 that will be a welcome addition to begin with. Secondarily you and what you do doesn't account for the general wow population. Those items will benefit some people and won't benefit others. <br />
<br />
Like you said you went to 335 quickly, so it doesn't matter if those items are 282 or 310 they'd be completely useless to you. Unless you think of course they should scale right up to the 350 range. At which point we're done with this nonsense. <br />
<br />
It's a minor QoL change they've added and it will benefit people. Especially new players or new alts.</div></div><hr />

So..... there already exist lvl120 heirlooms at this point. And now they add basically green questing gear for 20 dubloons each? Who can benefit from this? I am quite confident that a mainchar that holds hundreds of dubloons may also afford heirlooms.This is totally retarded ....<br />
<br />
Imo a solution could be to make those items work as catchup gear. It would would be great if a char leveled through IE could afford a set of this gear when reaching lvl120. They could make it ilvl340 so you may continue to gear up towards the current content through WQs, Heroics, Mythics .....<br />
<br />
these are 120 heirlooms<br />
and these fit slots that the heirlooms dont. <br />
also lots of people level from islands, and while leveling you get lots of dubloons, but no gear, making you pretty weak as you level, so pair these with heirlooms and well, leveling becomes just that much better!<br />
<br />
also yes a person doing isdlands while leveling can afford a full set of this gear... islands give like 4-6 each run so....<br />

<br />
gear world quests are <br />
1. not common<br />
2. you cannot select specific slots<br />
<br />
just like with vendors of all kind, people seem to forget just how powerful it is to be able to select ANY SLOT and gear it.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, and Timewalk vendor gear is super cheap -- 350s for a small number of badges. 365+ dropping in the dungeons themselves.<br />
<br />
I believe the Timewalks I did at 119 even had higher ilvl gear than 282.<br />
<br />
282 would have been alright for the very start of the xpac, but not now. Timewalking got upgraded, but these island figures are way behind the times.<br />
<br />
timewalking vendors are both limited time, and limited slots.</div></div><hr />

Obivously I think that, that comparison is directly in the article. Argus had unsullied tokens as catchup which were 880, and relinquished at 910 (which you had similiar to those now to buy with limited currency) - compared to the itemlevel of ToS (lfr: 885) and later argus (lfr: 925).<br />
<br />
And I think you misunderstand what scaling means here. They are not heirlooms that automatically adjust to your level. You use them once, and then they stay that level. So when you used such an item at 111, it means you get one single 214 item for 20 dubloons.</div></div><hr />

But you're just being pedantic, obviously questing doesn't require a role but clearly I'm not talking about that. And you might of been fine with it, but most people weren't. Hence they were scrapped, just like islands will be next expansion.</div></div><hr />

And that's the issue. For that case they are way too expensive OR too low. Just by leveling with IEs you will get around ~30-40 dubloons until you ding 120. Then spending that on items that are worse than items you could get by questing, significantly lower than items you get from world quests, not even talking about sinister crafted gear.</div></div><hr />

If you've power leveld a low gear alt in IE's and dungeons, you'll be sat around 250 ilvl anyways come 120. Personally, I had quest gear and 5 TW 365 pieces people had traded me during leveling, mine came out at 286 IIRC as I hit 120.<br />
<br />
You can craft 340 gear. Normal dungeons drop 340, Heroics drop 355. World quest rewards quickly scale up to the 340~ range not long after you start improving your item level. TW (when available) drops 355 as well if I'm not mistaken, and you can buy some vendor pieces that are also close to that item level for about 25 badges each. Arathi and Darkshore rares drop 340. Completing a Warfront drops 340 or 355, depending on which Warfront you're doing.<br />
<br />
282 isn't worth anything at this point in the game. It wasn't worth anything at the start of the expansion either, since Normals dropped 310 at level 120. If reports are accurate, they don't even have any unique models or anything else that would be an incentive to spend Doubloons on them.<br />
<br />
Until stated otherwise, I'm going to assume 282 is a placeholder number or something like that, because it makes no sense at all to have anything below 320 right now. And even 320 is a low number, which I'm only using because of where the gear comes from.</div></div><hr />

The only advantage it confers is that you get to choose the slot to &quot;upgrade&quot; but you can also do that if you have a reasonable amount of gold and access to the auction house. It also fails to provide the one item type that this might be semi-useful for in leveling (weapons, off-hands, and shields). <br />
<br />
This could be made sort of okay if it covered weapons/off-hands, as leveled alts will be coming out of Legion with artifact weapons that take up both slots automatically. It is difficult to replace the artifact quickly if the quest you complete gives a 1h and you have no off-hand, shield, second 1h, or whatever for the off slot. These could be improved to a purely leveling (and actually useful) item if they let you choose a way to fill in that blank slot and actually use upgrades you get while questing.<br />
<br />
I assume there could be some transmog potential (maybe they pull from the pool of models used on existing IE mog?) but if they are intended to just be extra rolls at IE mog then just market them as that rather than BoA items for alts.</div></div><hr />

This actually sounds pretty fair, I missed this post before. You don't upgrade your gear at all when doing Expeditions, so maybe this gear is intended to plug the holes in gearing left over by not getting any quest rewards.

The price is too high for 1 piece of mediocre gear. Especially given the difficulty of getting dubloons. Once items were added for purchase with dubloons the droprate was nerfed a lot. Before the items were added I was getting dubloons about half the time, afterwards I was getting them about 10% of the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly.<br />
Heirlooms only fill so many slots, these fill the rest, and while leveling in islands you get NO GEAR so you start to become weaker and weaker, this fills that gap.<br />
<br />
this is not meant for people who reach 120 to get a head start.<br />
<br />
also 20 is pretty cheap for a SPECIFIC slot.<br />
<br />
i can get 4-20 per run on my max level toon, and 4-6 on my leveling chars<br />
<br />
imagine if every 5 dungeons instead of getting 1 piece per dungeon, you got 1 piece from 5 but it was a SPECIFIC SLOT of your choice.</div></div><hr />

I think I was at just below 290 when I hit 120 on my rogue last week - and the game did already offer some 315+ WQs. And while I cannot enter the warzone battle in Darkshore or Arathi with this, I still can do the world boss the week after for a chance a some very high il gear. Not that I try to do that religiously...but if I see a convenient quest that asks to kill one dude and get a 50% upgrade, I do it.<br />

That's barely higher than the gear that you finish questing in...Its got to be a typo, maybe 382 ilvl? But then you're barely below normal raid ilvl so I really don't know...<br />
<br />
It’s 282 ilvl gear for alts at level 111+. That’s not a bad increase to speed things up. The way I read it, this is also only for IEs and won’t affect open world, right?</div></div><hr />

....... Did you not read the full sentence or something? <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The item level starts at 214 for level 111's and increases up to 282 for a level 120.<br />
<br />
They start at 214 which is fking trash. With heirloom upgrades coming with 8.1.5, These are a complete waste of dubloons no matter how you look at it.</div></div><hr />

These tokens are for people that level through islands. End of story. It's better than doing same zone n-th time and you can grab some achiev and stuff to collect. But unlike questing you got no new gear, so there was problem after few levels, unless you mail some BoE from different char.<br />
<br />
It's literally nothing like Timeless Isle, Tanaan or Argus tokens, which were intented to catch up for new raid as new max level.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
July 2 match better as Azshara raid launch. 8.2 is probably end of May/early June.</div></div><hr />

Pretty much. Although it's cute Blizzard think they will affect the expac launch of an actual good game that their own players are flocking to. :)</div></div><hr />

I'd rather shoot myself than level through islands. That's 100 times more boring than questing through zones. But yeah more power to those people who want to do that.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eduwneso</div><div class="date">2019-03-06, 08:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I was 289 ilvl on my Alliance Alt when I dinged 120. The ilvl of the gear seems rather pointless, at least make it 320 or something imho.<br />
<br />
I think this change is more for players who only level with islands, so they have some gear as they spam those IE. They are making it so it's a alternative with gearing from questing or dungeons. Yeah they could give more Ilvl al 120 tho but it's legit leveling up, and if you have the heirlooms then it's not that expensive since it's less slots you need to cover I have not seen what slots it sells tho.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Explicit Teemo Nudes</div><div class="date">2019-03-06, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol even if you spam IE from 110-120 (eww? And who even does that anyway?) you can still go INSTANTLY do any available world quests and get better gear than that dubloom crap. Or you can go out and kill literally any rare mob in a warfront area. Or you can do dungeons. Or buy 310 gear for 150g. There are almost half a dozen outlets for gear available to fresh 120's that are so much better than whatever this dubloom gear is supposed to be. Maybe you should try understanding the system before you start calling other people dumb. <br />
<br />
I don't even get how you can enjoy IE enough to sit there and be triggered by negative feedback about it<br />
<br />
Nah, you're dumb and you don't understand the system and who it is made for.<br />
I do 5 IE per week on my main, if even that, and that's it. I don't like IEs.<br />
<br />
A lot of people despite leveling by doing quests, so they find any other way they can to level. IEs, get boosted, pet battles, etc. They don't want to do quests or world quests even if it's easily available and more efficient(and you can't do BfA world quests until you're max level, but you can use these tokens below level 120). Besides, you will be very, very weak if you do max level BfA content in Legion gear - or lower, if it's a character that you didn't do Legion content with.<br />
There are also mount farmers that will kill two birds with one stone by leveling their alts through IE in hopes of getting the mounts.<br />
<br />
I don't even get how you can not enjoy or give a damn about IE but still get triggered because they reward gear you don't find good enough.<br />
<br />

I'm going to challenge that statement with my own experience of leveling alts most of which via island expeditions and below are the number of coins they each have by the time they hit 120. The 300+ one is my main. 20 is a safe number your average character can get if the coins drop for you often enough. <br />
<br />

<br />
Start looting dubloons from the ground.<br />
<br />
And this gear is BoA, so it is still for people leveling alts through IEs even if they don't end up with 300 coins.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, but the gear isn't intended to be for fresh 120s. It's meant to be for people who want to level entirely through islands and not be immediately pummeled into the dirt because they're a level 119 character wearing level 109 questing gear. That's why it scales to the player's level.<br />
<br />
With that said, it's still a horrible solution. If the prices are final you'd be lucky to get more than a couple pieces of gear from 110-120 if you leveled entirely through islands. That's not going to stop you from being pummeled into a fine mist. Not to mention you'd have to spread those pieces out through 10 levels, since the gear itself doesn't scale.<br />
<br />
You can send the gear from your max level characters.<br />

I'm dumb yet you are the one admittedly spamming content you yourself don't like lol. Okay.<br />
<br />
And again, everything you just said can be tossed aside by the fact that you can BUY 310 or 340 gear for less than 1k gold lol. This addition is worthless and was implemented for an activity that it of itself is also worthless. And calling somebody else triggered while also using personal attacks and name calling is a bit hypocritical no? :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

You did, yeah. I just did the same to try to show you how your &quot;points&quot; are stupid. But stupid people like you won't get it even if you explain it for them.<br />
<br />
I'm not spamming anything. I like collecting stuff, so I'm doing the minimum to get as much rewards for as little effort as possible while still having a chance to get that collector stuff I can't get in any other way.<br />
<br />
Then everything is worthless since you can BUY 310 or 340 gear for less than 1k gold lol. Let's delete the whole game because you can BUY 310 or 340 gear for less than 1k gold lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My counter point then would be &quot;Why are the gear tokens BoA then instead of BoP?&quot; If they are for toons that level only through Islands then why would said toons need to be mailing the gear to alts?</div></div><hr />
