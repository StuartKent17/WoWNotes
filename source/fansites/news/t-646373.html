We're currently in the process of making further difficulty adjustments via hotfix to the following encounters:<br />
<br />
Ignis the Furnace Master<br />
Razorscale<br />
XT-002 Deconstructor<br />
The Assembly of Iron<br />
Kologarn<br />
Auriaya<br />
<br />
The difficulty of these encounters is being lowered in multiple ways. Some of the adjustments are live already, others will be live soon. Note that some of the spell tooltips for the encounter will not reflect the hotfixes being deployed until the next patch. As the hotfixes are deployed, the Service Status board will be updated. You can check the current hotfix thread here:<br />
http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=16474158165&amp;sid=1 (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/23/16474158165-recent-ingame-fixes--41609.html#rp_8)<br />
<br />
Further adjustments are highly likely to some of the other encounters in Ulduar, but these were the highest priority encounters for us. We want to allow additional players to experience more of the cool Ulduar content. <br />

Classes<br />
Two-Hand Tanking Weapons<br />
There are some high stamina, 2-handed maces in the game currently. However, 2 handed weapons are not in the immediate future going to be given tanking statistics. This is simply because both of the classes who can use these items to tank have been, more or less, designed around the premise that they would not need the additional itemization in those slots to make them effective. We also don't want to create an entirely new branch of items that will also clog up loot tables for a fraction of the population, especially when it's been handled in other more unique ways.

Ulduar<br />
Yogg-Saron Clouds bug<br />
We're looking into this, and can verify that you can rarely trigger the spawning of a Guardian of Yogg-Saron without being &quot;in&quot; the cloud. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/12/16473614432-problem-with-the-clouds-from-the-yogg-fight.html))<br />
<br />
Player versus Player<br />
Arena Balance<br />
1) Players tend to over-emphasize whatever makes the strongest case for themselves. We do have Arena teams beyond 2s and 2s are probably always going to be the trickiest to balance.<br />
2) Even if we do nothing, comps tend to change over time. Players develop counter strategies and new fotms roll around. That isn't an excuse to do nothing, but it is worth keeping in mind.<br />
3) We let DK and pally stay dominant too long last season. Rogue - priest looks like it is heading the same way. We don't think it's good for the pvp game for such comps to be so dominant.<br />
4) We are happy with both classes in PvE. Any changes would just be for PvP reasons. Glyphs are a good place to look.<br />
5) I would like to personally request that you chill any &quot;QQ got us nerfed&quot; rhetoric. We'd much rather focus on the classes in question and not our decision making process. <br />
<br />
Strands of the Ancients coin toss<br />
The plan is to implement the virtual coin toss at the beginning of the match randomizing which faction starts on defense in an upcoming patch. This was originally slated for 3.1 but had to be pushed back. Other temporary fixes for the issue would take just as long to implement, if not result in the same issues caused by randomizing offense/defense that came about in Beta. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/16474164939-if-you-cant-fix-strand-of-the-ancients.html))<br />
<br />
Upcoming Patch (see the announcement (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/16474164793-upcoming-changes-and-additions.html))<br />
Equipement Manager and new Argent Tournament mounts<br />
These improvements had been in the works already. We have a hierarchy of things that must make a patch and things that we can add in later. We often utilize the smaller patches (when we can) to implement things that either needed further testing or needed additional time. Large patches often have many interconnected items sewn within the technology and the way we want things to work that make some aspects absolutely necessary to implementing the patch as a whole. Smaller patches can and do happen as we need them to in order to better support the larger patches either by implementing a starting framework, implementing bug fixes, or adding new elements that can stand on their own.<br />
<br />
We definitely have a schedule (internal) that we are working from and are doing what we can to keep on that schedule as much as possible. Things like this,often have less impact on the release of large content patches. <br />
<br />
Argent Tournament Mounts clarifications<br />
The current mounts in the game are being updated to the new look. If you already purchased a mount from the Argent Tournament vendor by the time this minor patch goes live, your mount will be updated with the new look automatically. The cost for the updated mounts (new look) will be 100 Champion's Seals. <br />
<br />
[...] Just to clarify on this point, the new ways of obtaining Champion's Seals will not be added until the next major content patch (not the minor content patch referenced in the original post of this thread).

phew. <br />

It does kinda suck. I mean as far as casuals go i think most of us would be happy with naxx for a long time and eventually dipping into Ulduar. Although i think their new philosophy is normal modes everyone, hard modes hardcores.</div></div><hr />

its not 100% certain that every fight on the list will be made easier its possible some aspects of the fights will be made harder if blizz thinks it has to be. so please save your judgement till after the changes happen then if they are all made 100% easiser then you can complain.</div></div><hr />

I would say theyve made the first 5-6 bosses to casual (but still harder than naxx) and then given these casual players 5-6 bosses they have to really work hard at.<br />

I don't understand why people are crying about this, go do Ulduar 25 in hard mode and you'll be far out gearing the casual you hate so much. This is nothing like Naxx.<br />
I don't even know why Blizz bother telling us this stuff, because of the nerd rage it causes. No one in the world has even cleared the final boss of Naxx, so until you go do that, pipe down.</div></div><hr />

I'd have to disagree with the statement that the 10man Naxx geared individuals can not down 10Uld. Take a look at my Paly. While I do have a few 25man items I'm primarily in 10man or the non BiS 25man items. My guild is probably as casual as you can get. We have no raid times assigned and occasionally run a midnight raid. Last week alone we wiped a few times learning the fights but with it being our first time in were able to clear all the way to Hodir in 2 days. No its not a fast run, yes we wiped alot, but bascially our Dps was on point, our healers had a clue, and both tanks knew how to taunt.<br />
<br />
Out of all the NERFS I can somewhat agree with is the Ignis debuff. As it was to get the 20 needed it took almost as long as the cooldown to summon another one. So if you missed even one debuff you were not trying to taunt the new guy, and drag the first one into the water. I don't think needing less buffs was the answer maybe 2 more seconds on the cooldown to call, but it is the only nerf I can say was ok.<br />
<br />
But overall this was uncalled for. On top of that has anyone noticed the nerfs to Naxx. If somebody is having trouble in Uld they could just go farm that a little more if they need i213 gear lol.</div></div><hr />

Hmm I'm in a 10 man guild and we have down'd 6 bosses (we only raid 5 hours a week), and it's taken an hour - 90 mins of wiping on most bosses (not including first). The problem is not the difficulty but the RNG involved in alot of the bosses. There's just too much luck (which isnt based on skill) involved in some of the fights, so I think that's why Blizz is making some of them more forgiving.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dumbhammer</div><div class="date">2009-04-29, 03:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">its not nerd rage or nothing like that.<br />
<br />
I think its ok for ppl to see more content, but dont tell me that with naxx10man gear u cant clear ulduar10 because you can.<br />
<br />
but nerfing it the first day, then the next week, then the 2nd week, come on... i dont give a fuck if they nerf kologarn or those sh1ts anyway, but freya thorim and hodir are a joke, mimiron need a lil coordination, so what they will kill everything but 4 bosses? and then they will start to complain again because they will say that mimiron its like m'uru prenerf and pam mimiron nerfed.<br />
<br />
and ye, general vezax is a joke, one of the easiest bosses there.<br />
<br />
So only C'thun version2 left and algalon <br />
<br />
<br />
and if they have 10man naxx gear, they should do naxx25 and then ulduar10/25<br />
<br />
dont worry in a month people will be able to clear ulduar in greens.<br />
<br />
and the biggest problem of this is that in 6-7 month they will open other raid with a decent difficult lvl, good guilds will have hard mode items, noobs will have ilvl226 items, so the encounter will be a chanllenge for the decent guilds, but because of the gear the encounter will be even harder for the noobs with free epixs and w/o brains.<br />
<br />
<br />
But you have to realise that the new welfare epics is 10 man easy mode loot. It's a fact of life in WoW 3.0, like BG gear was in WoW 2.0. Blizz will always throw the casuals something. The problem with Naxx/OS/VOA and to some extent EOE, was that there was no step up, ie. PUGers had the same gear as the hardcore players. Atleast for more hardcore players Ulduar has a challenge that can get them better loot than the casuals. It's there for you. <br />
<br />
Which is not to say I like hard modes, personally I find it boring doing the same boss with another dragon on him. I don't really care if the loot is better, because killing a dragon with 1add or 3adds...it's still the same damn fight. Do I really want to do the same fight I've been doing the last 3 months already? So I'm not a fan of hard modes because theyre unoriginal, however at least they are there for players such as you</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is true to some extent. People who come from EQ days or Vanilla WoW, some of them are very bitter at the changes, but they need to get used to the fact that WoW is ever changing and Blizz can do what they like. The main problem is they don't want to move on to a more challenging game because they like to a) play with their current WoW friends, b) like the WoW universe than some random MMO c) have high expectations of an MMO, and frankly most other MMO's lack the Blizz &quot;polish&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Do you seriously think most 10 man guilds had the ability or did EOE / OS drakes?? You really have a high expectation of people. Why does this bother you? If Ulduar is so easy, go do hardmodes.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. People need to stop getting outraged for no reason. I swear half the &quot;hardcore&quot; players (no armory to prove it) in the wow community need any reason to bitch about something.</div></div><hr />

Its difficult shit even with the changes to the first few bosses. Even if you get passed them you have to down hodir and yogg and algalon. 10 man KT went down on the Skywall server mere days after the patch went live. The fact that he went down while everyone was essentially in northrend blues and shitty epics from heroic 5 man dungeons left something to be said about the difficulty of Naxx. Now 8 days after 3.1 comes out, not one guild on the server has even touched yogg saron or algalon. Everyone is in shiny purple tier 7.5 gear with their hulking KT weapons, and they still can't get it down. Its damn hard people. Even with the changes ill be impressed if any guild downs algalon in the next 2 weeks.</div></div><hr />

Hey, &quot;hardcores&quot;, wipe off your tears and do it on the hard mode. Weren't they implemented just for you? Easy mode is for casuals, don't whine that you breeze trough casual content. Did you, by occasion, missed the buffs to the hard modes Ulduar received? Yep, I bet you did. Nobody ever sees the buffs on encounters, because you can't whine about it. Instead, let's whine about nerfs, any nerfs. Yeah!</div></div><hr />

on skywall server there has not been a yogg kill. and im pretty positive no one on any realm has downed algalon as of yet. im just comparing ulduar completion to naxx completion. by the end of the first week after 3.0, kt was puggable. that definately isn't going to happen with ulduar.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baron01</div><div class="date">2009-04-29, 05:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im visiting official forums pretty regularly to check on news and stuff. I have to say there is minimum amount of complaints about overtuning/high difficulty of Ulduar. In fact, those threads are non-existing if you try to compare it to previous major patches/expansions.<br />
What you can notice is that when such posts appears, it is quickly swamped by self-proclaimed hardcore raiders and masters of all in wow. The amount of whines and flames that ensues in such thread is absolutely horrible.<br />
Ironicaly, most of the PVE related whines are of those who claim everything is easy. Wave after wave raises as Blizzard continues to tune encounters in Ulduar. There does not have to be reason, it is enough to see word &quot;reduced&quot; in Blizzard's comment.<br />
These balancing and tunning attempts are not requested or cried for by the public. It is Blizzard's decision to make the content available to large population of people. They have said it before and I applaud them for sticking to it.<br />
<br />
Most importantly, seeing the amount of posts with &quot;zomg-everybody-will-be-running-in-T8-or-better&quot; mindset makes me very sad. Why are so many people interested in what others are wearing. The gear should help you to overcome future encounters. It should not be used to measure your greatness or ego.<br />
<br />
Also on the topic of Ulduar 10 doable in Naxx 10 gear. Probably possible for DPS and healers to some extent with the recent changes to Ulduar bosses, however, Naxx 10 gear--or 10-man gear in general bar few exceptions--is not enough for tanks to be geared for the task. Naxx10 protection itemization is horific, some of the drops are barely upgrades to HC blues and purples. Absolute cherry on top of it is T7 where 2/5 of the set are just horific, 1/5 is sidegrade, and the rest is ok-ish.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ignis (only the stacks change), Mimiron ones and General Vezax trash mobs are more or less logical. I would love a non-respawning trashs on General tought, they cut badly our raiding session (3 hours with a 2 hour respawn and we need 30 min or so to clear them without stupid wipes).<br />
<br />
Mimiron can take some little nerf too if they wanna 10-man guilds to down him regularly. And General Vezax IMHO needs to return more mana on 10-man on the saronite clouds, as we don't have that many spare heals and is harder to do the rotations.<br />
<br />
And I agree with the above poster about tanks on 10 man. Our Warrior has BiS 10-man plus some 25-man items, and w/o ALL the stamina buffs (in 10 man is not that easy) including flask and food he gets killed on 2.2 seconds on General Vezax (two auto-attacks). And in that fight everybody suggests avoidance gear.<br />
<br />
Is great that 10-man are tuned in PTR by BiS 25-man guilds. Way to go.</div></div><hr />

We had them, they were called Heigan and Thaddius. Go do them again, and watch the crappy players die. They'll blame it on lag or make up a BS excuse, but the truth will always be that they died because they were horrible players. Sadly, we have no skill checks anymore.<br />

Nah, those changes are what Blizzard called tuning. Like Razorscale pre-pre-pre-pre(?) nerf when you had to do her with the achievment, else she'd enrage and they changed it so casuals could have a shot at it as well.<br />

Survivalbility still isn't there and you should know it. The first changes you were to make seemed good but then you changed your mind. Did you think shadow priests would be overpowered? We are better in battlegrounds but since you don't reward battlegrounds and people need to run arena the changes were quite pointless, don't you think?<br />
<br />
There you go, you got me to go disc for arena. It's doing well and disc can tank the burst (which is still there, haven't you noticed?) decently and you can enjoy life as priest on arena. However, we do have some mana problems and have you really thought about how the pve nerfs will affect disc pvp? Or do you actually think we are OP pvp because you're actually are considering nerfing us even more there?<br />
<br />
What's your problem with priests really? Is it too bad to let the priests shine at least a little? <br />
<br />
You said you waited to long to fix dks and pallys and why did you do that? What did you actually think would happen? That their burst would fly away and not come back by itself? Why did you wait too long?</div></div><hr />

I can understand them though, Ulduar is suppose to be extremely hard and take a while to manage. <br />

Hard Modes UNDOABLE? How come there are lots of guild who already did them? Who already tried Algalon? Who already did almost every hard mode in Ulduar?<br />
<br />
Those guilds have the same items available to them as you do. Only those guilds got skill and dedication. You probably don't.<br />
<br />
<br />
Word!<br />
The good guilds should be the first ones to make it and they are doing well, if other can't perform they need practice and should go and get it. Nerfing Ulduar is not the way to fix it, we have naxx people can run in order to gear up and get skills. <br />
<br />
I would rather see a nerf to the new VoA-boss, but that's just me... I'm not a raider and if I were to be I would go naxx to get practice and gear... I wan't Ulduar to be hard and a challange that need time, effort, practice, communication, gear and skill.</div></div><hr />

Since the high end guilds clear it without any problems, why is it so bad to get a *slight* nerf? Cuz yes, its a slight nerf. The high end guilds will clear Ulduar if Blizz keeps the bosses the way they are, and a nerf gives guilds that arent in the top 10 also a decent chance to see the loot from bosses deeper in.<br />
<br />
I've seen people without a lvl 70+ char QQ about Ulduar on forums, and i bet there are loads on these forums aswell.<br />
<br />
And hardcore guilds run 25mans, not 10mans<br />
I raid Ulduar10 and i havent had much chance to go deep inside it because we spamwipe on lots of bosses, and a nerf gives us a bit chance to go deeper.<br />

<br />
I comment changes this way (from 10 man raider PoV) :<br />
<br />
Emalon was retard check if ppl can run away and change target they dps. First we killed him with 9 ppl in raid on second pull. Gj with nerfing, I can now pug 25 man version with all my alts<br />
<br />
Ignis was very hard before any nerfs (1st week) This week it was so easy, that next reset we were decided to do achivements and take only 2 healers.. gg nerfing it even more.<br />
<br />
Mimiron bots - ok, dmg they did was spiky, now it will be more suistained.<br />
<br />
Deconstructor was easy once ppl realized what to do. Now it will be piss easy.<br />
<br />
Trash before general - it was though and I welcome this change.<br />
<br />
Kologarn needed ppl to watch things around so it was toned down even it wasn't necessary.<br />
<br />
Assembly of Iron had a lot of incoming dmg which needed serious HPS - that's why it was toned down probably to bring it on par with encounters in same area.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think most of those changes were needed. Bad players shouldn't kill bosses to be able to experience content. Bad players should learn to play better to be able to kill bosses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I find very disturbing is this!<br />
<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
Two-Hand Tanking Weapons<br />
There are some high stamina, 2-handed maces in the game currently. However, 2 handed weapons are not in the immediate future going to be given tanking statistics. This is simply because both of the classes who can use these items to tank have been, more or less, designed around the premise that they would not need the additional itemization in those slots to make them effective. We also don't want to create an entirely new branch of items that will also clog up loot tables for a fraction of the population, especially when it's been handled in other more unique ways. (Source) <br />
<br />
Blizz is actively denying that 2h wapons don't have tanking statistic, while there are some very specific feral tank weapons with armor on it?<br />
<br />
How can Blizzard be so stubborn an arrogant? They refuse to make 2H tanking weapons, while one spec of one class is actually forced to take very specific tanking weapon tailored only for that built. <br />
<br />
If Blizzard do not want these things to exist, then ok. <br />
<br />
Remove (and replace) all armor attribute from weapons and give back tank druids at least some scaling with armor on jewelry slots. AT least one talent should affect all armor, regardless if it is tied to iLevel or armor as a stat.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isah</div><div class="date">2009-04-29, 08:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Step back from the game, look at it as a business. They want to offer something for everyone for Ulduar because it keeps the money rolling in. <br />
<br />
So hard modes are being buffed and some normal modes are being made easier. It's still an enjoyable challenge which will take a guild raiding 2 nights a week a month or two to get through....and then there are hard modes.<br />
<br />
Also they probably did the analysis on numbers entering Ulduar and how far they had gotten. Once a certain threshold had been reached things could be made easier for the rest of their customers.<br />
<br />
This is a business decision. They need to cater for all their player base. Personally I can't see a pug UD 25 ever. UD10 maybe and only with people overgeared for it.<br />
<br />
TBH you lot are behaving like selfish cnuts. The content belongs to Blizz and if they want more of the player base to see it, good for them. They've reserved hardmodes especially for anal retentives like you. Blizz are providing a challenging game for everyone. Algalon is still not dead yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
WoW was the most populated back in vanilla? ummm, sorry but thats straight out wrong. WoW now has 11+ MILLION players, much more than vanilla wow had...hmm blizzard must be doing something right because people keep flocking to their game.</div></div><hr />

All the hardcores on these boards a month ago were saying &quot;we want encounters that are tuned like M'uru was, that was the perfect encounter&quot;, now you're all on here saying &quot;waaaaaah, don't nerf the normal modes, the Hard modes are too difficult for us, we want a medium difficulty mode&quot;. Ensidia have said they don't consider anything Hard Mode in Ulduar to be as difficult as M'uru (with the possible exception of Mimiron and Yogg). Could it be that all these whining Hardcores actually never saw M'uru pre-nerf? That you were all crying out for something and now that you've got your Hardcore option you realise you aren't actually that hardcore after all?<br />
<br />
Blizzard has given everyone an option. Tackle an Ulduar tuned for casuals, for people who raid twice a week for 3 hours a time, or tackle an Ulduar tuned for hardcores- something you can wipe to your little heart's content on and get the whole &quot;3 weeks of wipes and then getting the boss down&quot; sensation you've been crying out for. Do people really have the nerve to now turn round and say that's not what they wanted?<br />
<br />
Blizzard will NEVER, EVER please you people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I find very disturbing is this!<br />
<br />
Blizz is actively denying that 2h wapons don't have tanking statistic, while there are some very specific feral tank weapons with armor on it?<br />
<br />
How can Blizzard be so stubborn an arrogant? They refuse to make 2H tanking weapons, while one spec of one class is actually forced to take very specific tanking weapon tailored only for that built. <br />
<br />
If Blizzard do not want these things to exist, then ok. <br />
<br />
Remove (and replace) all armor attribute from weapons and give back tank druids at least some scaling with armor on jewelry slots. AT least one talent should affect all armor, regardless if it is tied to iLevel or armor as a stat.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think its right that 2handers doesn't have tanking stats. Imagine - you can have shiny 2h with dps stats and have your other gear balanced about it or blizzard will *nerf* tanking gear to have it balanced about you wearing 2h tanking stat weapon. I definitly think its much better as it is now.</div></div><hr />

But seriously I don't see the problem, if you want a challenge then go do the hard-mode.<br />
Blizzard specifically made the hard-modes for people who loves give everything they can and more.<br />
<br />

If you find the game boring and don't give you what you want, then it's time to ask yourself;<br />

<br />
As I see it there's 3 kind of people that plays THE WOW.<br />
<br />
1st is the so called Retards that doesn't get the game as well as you should and even go as far as calling them casual (which I'm against, since I know casuals that actually are good raiders). These people want to explore the the content and get tons of gear and wants to be the best with minimal efforts. Without realizing that just not gonna happen, no matter how many nerfs Blizz. might imply to the future patches, realize it, it's just not gonna HAPPEN! <br />
<br />
2nd are those Normals who like to play the games at night, or when they wake up, right before work or school. They have an easy life, and an easy game. They want hardcore content, but Blizz knows that they will also whine about hardcore content, as they are never gonna see the end of it. So yeah, Blizz nerfed it here and there, to even give these guys get a glimpse of this Ulduar... You want a &quot;normal&quot; raiding difficulty that lies above the level of the &quot;retards&quot;, and then Blizz gives you the chance of actually get the same feeling as those hardcore guilds - And you still complain? These People complain whether it's too easy, or too hard... So you gotta get it normal, and if you get through ulduar at moderate speed, isn't that normal?<br />
<br />
So in the end, these people end up being either retards, or the &quot;hardcores&quot;...<br />
<br />
3rd are the legendary Hardcore players (rawr!)... They are our idols (if you can call them that...?). They clear the game within a few days to 1 week(yes I'm aware of Alganon or how his name is spelled, but taken apart from that..), and then they are just farming it as well for the Hardmodes. These players are striving to be the best, in the eternal competition that's a part of WoW. You guys call them no-lifers... I don't get that, I'm sure these guys get laid (in some way... they must!), they make money on gaming? That kind of makes them playing WoW into a proffesion, as in, they are pro at what they are doing. They are going to GET the Hardmodes, soo.. Keep trying!<br />
<br />
So yeah, if they say Hardmodes are too overtuned for even them, there might be a point in what they are saying. But perhaps, it just takes time to get the fights 110% correct as well as a perfect execution. Months of farming, and then to finally get it down.... Tell me if I'm wrong, but isn't that what all want as a hard encounter? The so called Mu'ru encounter. And don't come saying you dont like farming for weeks or months and then still like Vanilla WoW... Because even I didn't play Vanilla WoW, I'm pretty sure you needed to farm resistance gear, and all kinds of other needed items, to be able to progress? - And yes, even still then, people progressed in greens back then. <br />
<br />
Sooo.... We've come to an end. People will always complain when something doesn't please them selves. I see Ulduar as a fair piece of content, nothing too hard now, and still be a challenge, which is what I want, so am not gonna complain. I like it as it now, and I'm not gonna deny, that I think some changes are unnessesary. But meh, I still enjoy the game :)<br />
<br />
Well, yeh go ahead, call me a retard, my guild a club of shitheadnoobfaggotswithlameskills-retards... But I don't care, because I know I'm right in what I'm saying, and I don't see a reason to get upset over this, it's a game, Blizz makes millions, since you're still paying to play the game. And I see that Blizz are doing as a first priority to earn some money, so they can make cooler games (yay). And then next to try to please their customers, and be honest, would you be able to please every single 11mill. player???</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iguana</div><div class="date">2009-04-29, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why are so many replies about me me me me me.<br />
<br />
I dont get the rage!? NOONE knows what the actual numbers are - only Blizzard. People seem think their own experiences are the whole truth.<br />
<br />
Blizzard wants 10 man normal mode to be widely played - they have stated that. They want Ulduar10 to be a viable progression from Naxx10. <br />
<br />
At the moment Ulduar10 is certainly too hard for ilevel 200 players. People (that are being honest and not epeening due to internet anonymity) saying Ulduar is easy isnt clearing it in Naxx10 gear.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has the numbers - if too few are playing Ulduar - they will nerf it. If Ulduar is only accessible to players that have farmed Naxx25, they will nerf it. That is what is happening.<br />
<br />
And if hardmode is too hard - they will probably nerf it later. But nerfing easy mode brings more gear into players hands for trying the hard modes.<br />
<br />
You have to be really blind, if you think Blizzard will allow Ulduar normal mode only to be clearable by 10% of the playerbase. <br />
<br />
And if you are the poor player that thinks normal is to easy and hard is too hard - we'll sucks to be you, but you are obviously not a part of the majority of players that Blizzard wants to adress atm.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gondolfin</div><div class="date">2009-04-29, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All we needed for Ulduar was bug fixes, not nerfs. Bosses were hard yes, but not impossible. So you had to work for a whole night on one boss? Big deal, that's the point. If Blizzard's release of content is consistent then it will be another 4-6 months before we see Icecrown. Ulduar has to keep us going for that length of time and it looked like it could. My guild is casual and I expected a full clear in about 2 months, which would have been fine by me. My server is usually one of the slowest to make progress in the EU and already we are expecting the first 25 man Yogg kill this week. After just 3 resets! 7 guilds on the Alliance side alone have cleared up to the General.<br />
<br />
It's fine to let people experience content but you risk ruining the raiding element of the game if just anybody can do it. Certain elements of the game are supposed to be exclusive. High end PVP is beyond me, I really suck at it. But I don't expect PVP to be made so easy that I can be good at it. Similarly, I have neither the time nor patience to farm hundreds of achievements. I don't expect these to be made any more accessible. Raiding is what I love about the game and Tier 7 almost killed it for me and many others. I remember tentatively stepping into OS with my guild, all of us in level 70 epics and a few level 80 blues and we saying &quot;guys, let's just take a look, get a feel for the fight and we'll come back in a few weeks to down it when we have better gear&quot;. We one-shot it.<br />
<br />
Then we come to Ulduar, and we have the Leviathan which is free loot, but fine. Then we find Razor and Ignis, bosses that didn't just fall over and empty their pockets of epics. <br />
<br />
The game is meant to involve skill and co-ordination. That is the fun. Earning the loot. The sad thing is, Blizz had it. They had it right and they screwed it. Buying the game does not entitle people to see all the content. Getting reasonable good at the game does. If you must make all content puggable and faceroll easy then do it just prior to the next expansion as was the case in TBC, not 2 fucking weeks after you release the content. Have some faith in your player base. They'll get it eventually.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1 more try for u idiot:<br />
<br />
easy mode ulduar -&gt; naxx was harder<br />
hard mode ulduar -&gt; only 1-3 guilds can dream of downing them<br />
<br />
so what are the rest of the ppl supposed to do the next 4 months?<br />
<br />
U sir are an idiot :)<br />
<br />
(and im talking about 25 man ONLY, 10 man is the biggest joke on earth. First week we accidently activated xt's hardmode and thorims hardmode...)<br />
<br />
<br />
Ulduar isnt tuned for full BiS gear, hard modes arent tuned for full BiS gear, 10 man isnt tuned for 25man (BiS) gear. <br />
<br />
I'll explain what that means now:<br />
_Ulduar normal modes is (too) easy for the BiS crowd, such as urself.<br />
_Hard mode is to hard as you lack Ulduar gear (yes, you'll need to do some farming of ez-mode Ulduar but NOT for 4 months, 1 month tops imo)<br />
_And just stay out of 10mans, it's about time Blizz puts them on the same lockout. Why on earth someone that goes in 10man with a full 25man geared group thinks he can have a clear view on 10man difficulty is beyond me, but hey Flameboy here doesnt even seem to understand that you'll be able to do hard modes with some better gear and that it doesnt take 4 months to get that gear, so ye... <br />
<br />
I'm tired of reading posts from people that are so used to whine about everything that they can't think straight anymore. Lean back and think about it, everything will come to you.<br />
<br />
And on-topic: To soon imo to start swinging the nerfbat around but ah well, I'm in it for the hard modes. So easier regular mode bosses means even faster gearing to start the hard modes I guess.</div></div><hr />

But , ofcourse , for morons like you that were one of those guilds that skipped Magtheridon , Kaelthalas , Vashj and got to Black temple only to whine RoS or Bloodboil are too hard , it's hard to comprehend that there is a difference between the actual difficulty of a encounter and the Hard Mode achievments.<br />
Most Hard modes achievments give abolutelly NOTHING new to the encounter , they just bring stronger dps test /more dps taken by raid etc.<br />
Also I very much doubt you even got close to Muru or that you ever cleared a challenging boss in your life , so please move along , Patch 3.0 at the end of TBC was for bads like you to tackle content yet you still managed to wipe on some encounters.Whatever , there's no point talking with people like you , your the type of people that will ruin the game just because your IQ is under the sea level and you just can't get the ideea of reading and understanding of a boss fight.<br />
Send my regards to your retarded friends , the game will soon be formed only from the likes like you.scum.<br />
Got it now or do I need to draw it for you?<br />
<br />
<br />
God, I think my sides have just split from laughing so hard. There's a delicious irony in people who have no understanding of syntax and grammar, and lack even the comparatively straightforward ability to either a) spell or b) use a spell checker, tossing around the 'you haz lowz IQ' jibe. You really proved your superiority there, Einstein, your mother must be so proud... And for the record, I await the day, oh happy day, when the game is 'formed only from the likes of me'- the fewer pseudo-elitist tossers like you (who claim to want hard content but then bitch because it's TOO hard) around the better as far as I'm concerned. If you're unhappy about the difficulty of Ulduar (both Normal and Hard Mode it would appear), here's a few suggestions:<br />
<br />
1) Do the early bosses Hard Mode, since these are the ones that have been nerfed- then you have no right to get your panties in a bunch about the nerfs.<br />
2) Use the gear you get from the early Hard Modes to get the latter bosses on Farm.<br />
3) Use the gear you get from the bosses on Farm to start attempting latter Hard Modes.<br />
4) Get down the latter Hard Modes and tackle Algalon.<br />
5) Whine and cry about how difficult it is and preferably quite the game in frustration.<br />
<br />
That will provide you a challenge, while gearing you up sufficiently to tackle the later Hard Modes. Everyone's a winner and you have enough content to challenge you for months to come. Too complicated a suggestion? Do I have to draw that for you?</div></div><hr />

I'm so sick to read comments like this...<br />
I'm a 10man-Raider by choice ! Because I prefer raiding with 10 people I actually like ! Because I do have a job, a wife in short a real life (you know - that thing that might hit you very hard if something outside that lcd-frame ever catches your attention).<br />
So my equip is Nax10.<br />
<br />
I'm sick of Nax25 people, telling me that Nax10 is oh so easy. The only things that's easier for 10-man raids are organizational. In a Naxx10 everyone is needed. The usual 4-5 man down in the first minutes of a Nax25 random raid won't get you a whipe... 2 man down in a Nax10 raid will get you a hard time... Or let it be 3-4 lame damage dealer, or 2-3 bad healers - no Problem in Nax25... Again a big problem in Nax10 if one of your two healers is a bad player...<br />
And I know what I'm talking about because I feeled forced to attend to Nax25 random to upgrade my gear...<br />
<br />
I'm not talking about ulduar beeing to hard or nax not beeing too easy. But I'm just plain sick of people in 25 heroic gear telling me that I need to learn to play if I got difficulties in my normal 10 man gear.<br />
And I'm sick of hardcore players that don't go hardmodes - you get better gear there so go get it and leave everyone else alone.<br />
<br />
Casual doesn't mean I need to learn to play. It just means I do have a real life. I do have only 2 evenings a week with 3 hours for raiding. I don't want gifts - but I do want to be able to see all of ulduar within the next 2-3 month ! Stop mixing up casuals with people who dont know how to play !</div></div><hr />

I believe that in this case, the poster was talking about ulduar 25. why would you assume he meant 10 man? The nerf seem to apply equally across the board.<br />
<br />
Here is my point of view:<br />
<br />
At this rate, Ulduar will be split into two extremes. The facerolling normal mode, and the too hard to don for most guilds hard mode. From what i have heard, muru took 4 days for the top guild to down after the gate had been opened. well, it's week 2, and the hard modes are still up, meaning that only the very best of the best will be able to down them for weeks or months to come, and i believe some are also mathamatically impossible, according to theorycrafting.<br />
<br />
So, with the facerolling people sated, and the very top guilds battling over hard modes and algalon, where does that leave the good casuals and semi hardcores, which i believe make up a majority of the playerbase?<br />
<br />
Ulduar was fine as it was. The initial nerfs were ok, but this seems excessive, to be frank.</div></div><hr />

Don't know about Ulduar25... But going Ulduar10 with Nax10 gear is not that easy that the nerf will ruin the experience. And still: Too easy - go hardmode.<br />
I only quotet that post but adressed all of the &quot;if ulduar10 is to hard stop whining - get nax25 gear first&quot; ...<br />

<br />
<br />
You are missing the point here, mate.<br />
<br />
There are already 2h tanking weapons in game, BUT the are designed for one sub-spec of one class, feral tank.<br />
<br />
All these weapons have<br />
<br />
Armor,<br />
Agility<br />
Stamina<br />
etc.<br />
<br />
By this Blizzard statement, it's just show, how clueless they are. They give feral tanks special weapons, then they even proclaim, they don't want to such thing to exist.<br />
<br />
If they really want to homogenize all tanks then good, get rid of armor of 2h weapons and give back feral tanks armor scaling with AT LEAST 1 TALENT even on jewelry slots. Thick Hide is very good candidate.</div></div><hr />

Mimiron changes are welcome tho, less spiky is good, even if it causes em to hit faster.<br />
They should just brick in Ignis his part of the instance and be done with it, the fight must have been the fight that has changed the most on live severs in history by now.<br />
Kologarn was fine as he was, no changes needed what so ever.<br />
Assembly changes are kinda weird, seems they want to make its hardmode to be easier so more people get acces to the questline for the keepers or something?<br />

<br />
The first round was ok: after 3hours wiping on Razorscale (10man) we welcomed the nerf to the fireball damage which our healers had a lot of trouble healing up. After the nerf we downed him in the second try. XT was way too easy. We got him in our first try ever with only a few of us having read the guides. Ignis is just fine, we got him after 5-6 tries. So was Flame Leviathan ( 3rd try pre nerf ).<br />

Ulduar 10 is too easy for full 25 man geared characters, thus making the nerfs seem unwarranted and inciting mega rage at Blizz catering to the casualols. I hear people with guns have a distinct advantage in knife fights also.<br />

Keep in mind that uld-10 isn't aimed at high end 25 man characters, but at 10 man guilds who can't do 25 man instances.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Constructive</div><div class="date">2009-04-29, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This week our community's 25 man raid got stumped at Kologarn, while our 10 man force took Freyja down. We're a raiding community of the casual kind: meaning that we raid three nights, many members can only attend one night and we have everything between really fast learners with top rigs and perfect UIs to a lot slower people with pretty bad computers. Our members are between 18 and 40 years old. I love them all and we are set to take this together, but we are never going to put progress before everything else. All in all I've always considered us a pretty typical mix for the average wow raiding guild or community.<br />
<br />
So we defeat five encounters in 25 man, and eight in 10 man in the second week of raiding. That is not hard. After all, the raid zone is supposed to last for a while. Sure, we spent an entire night wiping on Kologarn, but to me that seems more than fair. We are not good enough to breeze through it. Back in BT, we spent 2 or even 3 weeks on Reliquary of souls.<br />
<br />
So from my casual perspective I don't think there is a call to make these encounters any easier. The enjoyment lies in the challenge after all.</div></div><hr />

WoW now has 11+ MILLION players, much more than vanilla wow had...hmm blizzard must be doing something right because people keep flocking to their game.<br />
<br />
<br />
You're mixing up accounts with online players.<br />
<br />
We all noticed how the servers got a little bit empty after 2 or 3 months with wotlk, we do have a ton of good players and a good chunk of them got bored after getting 80 with 3-5 days and clearing naxx/eoe/sarth. Some tried playing with alts, but the truth is that ppl left and came back only when near 3.1 launch (to get ready for the new changes and raid, farming mats, etc.).<br />
<br />
That didn't happen in vanilla WoW, why? Because you would have a lot more work and stuff to do before calling it done and stop playing waiting for a new content patch. That happened too (on a lesser scale, true) in TBC, because of the atunments or the raid dificult itself (remember when not everyone could clear kara/grull/mag in like 3h? and even without good gear?!).<br />
<br />
So, yes, servers were more populated in vanilla wow for longer time than now.<br />
<br />
And remember, if you bought a new account for, let's say, get that zevhra mount, your new account just got into &quot;11 million and growing players&quot;. You're now two active players for Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Well yeah, but Ulduar is &quot;way overtuned&quot; compared to Naxx. Emalon drops T8 loot, he shouldn't be a pushover. This is stuff you only get from killing the later bosses in Ulduar so to get them from a 20 minute encounter that you can pug might even be pretty galling to some raiders. <br />
<br />
And I suppose Emalon is hard-ish, but he can still be pugged. I did last week and one-shot it. With DBM auto-marking the overcharged add it was a piece of cake. The difference between Archavon and Emalon is simply that on Archavon 2 people had to know the fight (MT and OT) and on Emalon everyone has to know the fight. Other than having DPS that kow how to switch targets, the requirements are not prohibitive (2k DPS to nuke down the overcharged add I believe, a modest target for even a newly dinged level 80 char).<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe we should be able to faceroll our way to the some of the best loot in the game but it always seemed to me that reward should equal effort.</div></div><hr />

The MT eventually just quits the groups and I end up having to switch specs from arms to prot and I tank KT and the 2 adds because, once again, this stupid freaking paladin can't figure out that standing in glowy red circles is bad.<br />
<br />
So long story short, these are the types of drooling retards that Blizzard is propping up and encouraging by their baby-steps &quot;everybody gets to see content&quot; design mentality. It's bad enough that 5 mans aren't teaching people how to play their class because of how easy they are (which is their whole damn purpose), but now raiding has largely been that way as well up to this point in WotLK.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, no more.<br />
<br />
<br />
Everyone was able to see content, you couldn't wipe through it like you could naxx, but the encounters being nerfed now weren't hard. They were about for lack of a better word &quot;not standing in fire&quot;.<br />
<br />
I don't approve of the nerfs any more. There's easy and there's easy.<br />
<br />
We're getting to mimiron without too much hassle, taking on average ~5 wipes to learn and subsequently down a boss.This counts as &quot;not hard&quot;. Entire nights wiping to learn something is &quot;hard&quot;.<br />
<br />
No more nerfs. People who couldn't do thaddius don't need to see Ulduar, they need somone to hold their keys above them and jingle them, or any other shiny object.</div></div><hr />

But what people aren't debating is whether the nerfs are warranted or not.<br />
<br />
I mean come on 3 weeks after release, is that enough information to come to the discision that the encounters are too difficult? Also a big difference between Uldaur and Naxx is that when Naxx was first released strats for every boss were readily available there was no mystery no work to figgure out what to do. Even before WotLK there were many people who got into lvl 70 40 man raids and &quot;practiced&quot; in lvl 60 Naxx. So who is really supprised that average progression in Uldar is slower? <br />
<br />
Also the time period hasn't been long enough to prove that the &quot;blocks&quot; people are stuck on are true blocks. How many weeks of dying to an encounter does it take before you decide it's insurmountable without nerfs? Definitely more than 1. If people are stuck on encounters they should do one of two things.<br />
<br />
1) Research: fine tune the strat find what is killing you and attempt to address it either through raid composition change (duel spec allows you to change healer / dps / tanks without actually having to kick anyone out of the raid), raid positioning (just try tanking him somewhere else or positioning key healers / OTs at different locations), and if all else fails use tools like WWS and recount to figure out who is holding you back (yes dying from stupid shit is holding your raid back) and on learning attempts dont bring them. <br />
<br />
Let me clarrify JUST CAUSE YOUR FRIENDS WITH PEOPLE DOSN&quot;T MEAN YOU CAN BE BAD AND EXPECT THEM TO CARRY YOU IN NEW CONTENT. In every casual guild I see failing it's normally attributed to a select few people who are holding people back. It may seem heartless but if your comp can't perform well enough to allow you to run out of void zones or flame patches that's your fault. The game isn't graphically challenging and even with a &quot;decent&quot; internet connection is quite dooable, upgrade your comp get a better connection because the game shouldn't suffer because your too cheap.<br />
<br />
2) Preparation: people forget that hard content is hard because its designed around ideal raiders. In 10 man Ulduar it's designed around a raid sporting BiS Nax 10 with almost full raid buffs and for 25 man Ulduar it's set up assuming everyone has 212 or better ilvl gear. If you don't have full BiS gear the encounter is going to be more difficult than intended. Solution to this problem? Go back to Naxx. There is nothing wrong with dedicating one raid night to clearing Naxx obviously you still need stuff from there and its only going to make Ulduar fights easier. Also if your raid isn't using full consumables (feasts and flasks) then you need to.<br />
<br />
My guild is working on Thorim / Mimmron right not and we just started mandatory flask requirements, don't want to spend the 19g on a flask we can field someone who will.<br />
<br />
I just want to see one person come up and say &quot;My guild isn't full of knuckle draggers playing on 10 year old comps, we have tried all the things you suggested and we are still stuck on one of the bosses that are being nerfed. Justifiable nerfs are justifiable!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I would suggest that, as players in 25 man Naxx gear, it's not surprising that you're progressing well in 10 mans- you massively outgear the instance. That is, unfortunately, the consequence of Blizzard setting up parallel progression paths. Someone earlier suggested making 10 and 25 man share a raid lockout- that seems sensible to me if you want to prevent complaints about 10 man being too easy. Either that or some sort of scaling 10 man instance that ramps up boss damage relatively to cumulative iLevels in the raid. Nobody seems to understand that outgearing an instance will necessarily make it easier. Try it with a raid in all iLevel 200 gear, you'll soon find it more challenging. Even having all raid members in only 3 Naxx 25 items basically puts you at an equivalent level of a 10 man guild that has been raiding Ulduar for a month...<br />
<br />
As far as 25 mans are concerned, there's a difficult line to be trod by Blizzard. They want dedicated raiders to proceed to Hard Modes- that much is clear- and they want those Hard modes to be HARD. They want less dedicated raiders (say those who only raid twice a week) to be able to kill Yogg. That means content has to be hard enough to keep the less dedicated busy for a few months getting to Yogg, but also easy enough so that they don't give up, and so that they can clear the instance in 6-10 hours. The encounters also need to be easy enough for the dedicated raiders to be able to gear up relatively quickly so that they can try Hard Modes, and learn the fights in Normal Mode in the process- I assume they don't want the 'hardcore' raider to be wasting too much of their time in Normal mode- they are, after all, not who 'Normal Mode' is designed for. <br />
<br />
Its a difficult balance to strike. I'm not suggesting they've got it 100% right, but to completely ignore or fail to grasp what Blizzard are trying to do and just outright damn them for caving into casuals like most posters seem to be doing is disingenuous. They have a strategy, their analysis of encounters has suggested to them that reality is deviating from their strategy. They've realigned the instance to allow them to meet that strategy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Lol, true. That's the real point... too soon... why not going with the &quot;old&quot; model from last days of TBC? New raid tier, the previous one get some nerfs (like the atunment removal, boss requirements to reach it, dmg, etc.)?<br />
<br />
It's only what? 2 weeks?<br />
<br />
In the end, what is really sad is Emalon nerf. Archavon was stupid in a way that it didn't need to be since he would drop really good stuff for just a ridiculous work. Not the boss itself, the raid as a whole. Just get in and hit the big pinata, a very short raid instance and the only drop with comparable &quot;easy to get&quot; were the gloves, altough Sartharion raid is a bit more &quot;balanced&quot; with his loot table.<br />
<br />
Emalon was a really nice adition, a much better balanced fight for the drops he has on his loot table and finally some degree of &quot;proggress&quot; on VoA with the gear/retard check on Emalon. Didn't need nerfs, if you couldn't kill him, you should be trying something else 1st and then go to T8 the same way you shouldn't be trying Ulduar if you just hit 80 in your &quot;green/questblue glory&quot;.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iguana</div><div class="date">2009-04-29, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why do people insist on calling Ulduar10 too easy - when they are doing the instance in Naxx25 gear!?<br />
<br />
Blizzard always stated that you should be able to do Ulduar10 after gearing up in Naxx10. By that criteria (only) - the nerfs to the first 5-6 bosses is justified. Imo you can not get past more than 3 bosses in Naxx10 gear. Please prove me wrong, if you insist on crying over nerfs. <br />
<br />
Imo a better alternative would have been to make Naxx10 drop better gear - make a hard mode for 10man that drops i213. After gearing up in hard Naxx10, you could make people enter a non-nerfed Ulduar. That is the way they seem to be heading with Ulduar.<br />
<br />
You can always say that 10man shouldnt have their own progression independent of 25mans - but that is not what Blizzard intended. So its easy to see why they are nerfing now. They dont want a game where naxx25 geared pro-guilds should have a hard time in Ulduar10 normal mode (and as a resultat leaving the 10man guilds nowhere to progress).<br />
<br />
Its nothing to get so angry about - it is as expected. Hard mode is the new elite - normal mode is casual. Love it or leave it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Problems with justifying your logic to the nerfs seen:<br />
<br />
Iron Council, Ignis, and Razorscale are all &quot;Optional Bosses&quot;.<br />
<br />
The bosses you MUST kill to get to yog are FL, XT, Kogo, the 4 guardians, and the general. So 8 bosses in 2 days if your ONLY task is to get to Yog that is definitely dooable with a competent team in 2 days.<br />
<br />
So nerfing those 3 bosses in the name of &quot;Speedy kills for 2 nights a week guilds&quot; doesn't make sense, optional bosses should have higher difficulty than &quot;progression&quot; bosses just like with Viscidus and Ouro. Also hard modes are designed around Uldar gear so the upper 40% of players should have at least 6-7 pieces of Uldar gear before you can expect to do them. Sure super guilds can crush hard mode stuff due to pure skill but for the bulk of progression guilds they need a number of weeks to farm before you can expect to go to hard modes. 25 raider x 6 items / 13 bosses / 3 loots per boss = 4 weeks worth of complete Uldar clearing assuming every item dropped is an upgrade and nothing gets DEed. Realistically however progression raids are still working on Mimmron or the General meaning there is still about 3 weeks worth of farming before we can think about hard modes. <br />
<br />
Point is wait a couple weeks, at least until the top 40% are starting hardmodes before nerfing the normals. I'm not saying dont nerf them ever just not so soon after launch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well as a real casual, I i'm not happy with naxx more than a couple of times, then its boring. The reason to make it hard is of course because it takes them a long time to make new &quot;content&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's a fair point- I guess I've been looking at it in terms of my relatively casual 10 man guild- we haven't been skipping anyone other than Ignis (and only skipped him because he's been so utterly borked since the start) and I think we'd probably continue to do them if only for the purposes of gearing up for later bosses at this point. But again, Blizzard don't nerf encounters for no reason- there is clearly something about these encounters that they felt was not matching their intentions, and they've adjusted accordingly. And until anyone actually tries the fights, we won't know whether they've become faceroll or just a tiny bit easier...</div></div><hr />

Hardcore players, or players who spend more time playing in general, have worked to obtain the gear needed to progress quickly in Ulduar. If you do not want to or are unable to put in the time preparing for Ulduar then you should not be in there.

The way Ulduar is being nerfed every week is going to turn it into the new naxx and these forums will be filled with more QQ than ever.

<br />
I don't consider myself a hardcore player at all, and I don't consider my guild a crazy hardcore guild. None of us would ever hack it in an Ensidia or DnT, but we have a little intelligence. We raid 12 hours a week, and are now working on Thorim 25. We put in our time over the past 5 months grinding horribly boring raids to get our gear so at least all of us are at least 50% BiS (minus some of us that changed specs to fit guild needs :P). This wasn't hard to do, it just required a bit of commitment and an eye to the horizon, knowing that there were challenges upcoming.<br />
<br />
Ulduar came and we loved it. We had to think during an encounter for the first time since SWP and there were actually challenges. And then four(?) waves of nerfs in two weeks have already hit. I'm assuming it's because of massive QQ from people who didn't like meeting resistence in a raid. <br />
<br />
This leads me to one single question. Just because you can't get as far as you think you should have in the first month, what the hell makes you think that you're entitled to get as far as the top guilds on your server, let alone the entire game? If my guild of largely casual, yet dedicated and intelligent, players can get this far, there's no reason you can't. And we'll damn sure get further than Thorim this week. If you can't get past Kolo or AoI or Auriaya, then maybe you just need to spend a couple more weeks in Naxx/OS/Maly to top off your gear.<br />
<br />
Ulduar requires you to think, put in your time beforehand and act as a team. That's it. Just because there's a new raid that's above Naxx, it certainly DOES NOT mean that you are entitled to go into it and perform just as good as Ensidia without putting in your dues.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gilfanon</div><div class="date">2009-04-29, 03:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's great Haxxored, apart from a few things:<br />
<br />
1) Made up numbers are made up. If you're using them to justify anything then don't expect agreement from anyone. I could equally say that 80% of guilds think Ignis was too hard and should be nerfed, or I could claim that 63.4521% of Comms are stuck on Kologarn and short of producing a statistically significant analysis of a representative sample of the population of WOW raiders you are completely incapable of disproving my assertion. That doesn't make my assertion correct, all it does is prove that quoting made up numbers to support an argument is fundamentally flawed. <br />
<br />
2) Some guilds have cleared Hard Mode bosses. Therefore you are not in a position to say that Hard Modes are impossible. I will say it again for the 3rd or 4th time- dozens of people were on these boards a week before Ulduar was released saying they hoped that Ulduar would be a SWP-style wipefest tuned to M'uru difficulty. Dozens of people were bemoaning the fact a week after Ulduar was released that some guilds had beaten a few Hard Modes. Blizzard buffed them as a result, now everyone is complaining that they're too difficult? Blizzard nerfed a few optional bosses that are there primarily for your raid to gear up for Hard Modes and the last bosses. They're effectively helping you to get to Hard Modes easier, and you're complaining?<br />
<br />
Who ultimately cares about the difficulty of a few optional side-bosses? High end challenging raiding is all about Hard Modes now. Normal modes are supposed to require less than elite players. Blizzard always said Ulduar was not going to be massively more difficult than Naxx, and they're sticking to their word. The wipefest is there if you want it- the fact that some guilds have got down the Hard Modes means they are theoretically possible (at least the earlier ones are)- concentrate on those if you want a challenge. The great thing about the brave new world is that you get to pick and choose- do the early ones Hard Mode if you think they're not a challenge after the nerf. Do the later ones normal if you don't think they're do-able with your level of gear. You have options- use them.</div></div><hr />

Um, mate, not quite &quot;dozens&quot;. You see, the same hundred or so people posting on mutiple alts begging for Raiding to be turned into a Vanilla-style wipefest, so that they may &quot; clearly demonstrate their superiority&quot; over the &quot;üntermenschen casual scrubs&quot; do not quite make up the &quot;majority of the player-base&quot;.<br />

Again it's a question of your point of view. From my point of view you are no casual... 12 hours raiding per week... Add another 4 hours of farming needed to satisfy the need for new enchantments, flasks, buffood etc. ... Thats 14 hours... Adding sleeping an eating times that's a full day... 1 of 7 days of your week... So get over it - you are hardcore... Maybe not CRAZY hardcore but hardcore... Go to hardmode !<br />

No one asked for that. But reaching the final bosses before the next content arrives (2-3 Month ?) when practicing twice a week for 3 hours should be realistic. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Never expected it... Up to now we were able to kill 3 bosses and we needed to work hard for that... Due to Nax10 equip only... Due to only 3 hours twice a week... Due to players who only are able to participate every other week and therefore training began anew every week because they got the night shift and so on... Thats's whats happing if you got a real life, a work, a wife, children ! Because of the one nice guy you really like as a person but who just doesn't get it...That are the problems a REAL casual 10 man raid has to fight with... And get over it... There are many casuals out there... If they weren't blizz wouldn't bend...<br />
<br />
To turn it the other way around: Who are you to tell us we need to keep going Naxx10 which IS pretty boring now because we worked on it... there is no hardmode for nax - there is one in ulduar... <br />
<br />
Maybe the problem is: Ulduar10 with Nax10 gear ist too hard... But Ulduar25 in Nax25 gear isn't... But the nerfs hit both modes...<br />
Maybe Ulduar Hard is TOO hard because blizzard considered only noobs, cusuals and crazy hardcore - and forgot about the normal full addicted ...<br />
Crazy Hardcore Raids may be very loud - but they are pretty sure no more than 10% of players... <br />
<br />
(And the next one telling me Ulduar10 in Nax25 gear is too easy get's the most ignorant poster of the day award... Of cause it is to easy... with Nax25 gear in uldar10 you are just over equipped... Like starting SSC with full FDS equip and complaining...)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cerisan</div><div class="date">2009-04-29, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I for one am disappointed in the nerfs, and let me explain why.<br />
<br />
Naxx is beatable with the average raid member doing sub 3k dps. More than 2k I'd say, 2.5-2.7 should do it. What does it take to do that dps? Well, you can use green gems, cheap/no enchants, random and non-optimized gear (over/way under hit cap, wrong stats focused on etc.). You can spam your main nuke or use a very simple rotation. You can ignore all procs and basically hit your 2 key repeatedly. You can take pretty much any class combo and achieve success.<br />
<br />
Ulduar heroic-easymode pre-nerf seemed to bump up the dps requirement to over 4K average, maybe a bit more. A very noticeable increase. To hit 4k, you need to worry about really what the optimal rotation is. You need to understand your class, pick the right talents, gearing, gems and enchants. To move from the 2.5K to 4K dps level requires a lot of personal time. You need to research and gear your toon appropriately. Raid leaders need to recruit the proper mix of classes to field a properly balanced raid. It's quite a change in effort, both personally and organizationally.<br />
<br />
Ulduar heroic-hardmode looks to be requiring a dps minimum of 5K average, again perhaps a bit more. This requires that all raid members are geared out optimally, really know their classes, learn to encounters to a tee, and hope for no RNG hate.<br />
<br />
So if Ulduar is over-nerf'd, then the only differentiation is between marginal effort and skill vs. intense effort and great skill. It's kinda like going to 7-11 and seeing they only have an 8 oz. cup and the 128 oz. Big Gulp.<br />
<br />
A lot of folks would like to have the time they have spent in gearing/researching etc. their toons be rewarded in-game by having encounters that cannot be done by 1-button spammers in unenchanted gear. If, for example, it makes no difference whether you put the time in for SoH exalted and a Darkmoon Card:Greatness vs. no shoulder enchant and a quest reward trinket then that is frustrating.<br />
<br />
I doubt anyone is looking for M'uru type difficulty on EZmode, yet many folks, myself included, have put in some time in gearing/understanding/practicing and like it when there is a reward for that work vs. pressing the 2 key repeatedly.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dakkuuan</div><div class="date">2009-04-29, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LMAO!<br />
Look at those Ulduar nerfs. XT was a joke already with the changes. This just means i can afk for most of it all.<br />
And Ignis, meh, we only got round to killing him tonight. 3 Attempts before he was dead. The only change i can slightly (I'm talking 5%) agree on, is the # of stacks to make an add molten, but it's not something i would have really requested or whined about to be changed, simply because it wasn't that difficult.<br />
<br />
<br />
(please note this reply only deals with the quoted post)<br />
I think you need to understand that not everyone has a server that really has a lot of Ulduuar capable guilds. Take the Alliance side of Detheroc. Not only is this side of the server very small (Arch's log only has 19 successful defends of WG on the Alliance side, I'm assuming since the log was implemented and the horde have 200+) but the guilds on the server aren't the best. I'm not saying there aren't good guilds on the server, there just aren't very many. And these guilds tend to appear/disappear over night. They don't last. And I don't want to hear the BS reasoning to 'change servers'. I think some of you 'super hardcore', (cause I'm pretty hardcore myself and I'm not Ulduuar ready on either of my 80s, partly cause of bad luck and I have an actual life) forget that this a game that is played by 13 million people, or something like that. <br />
<br />
If Blizzard were to spend all its time (like it did through Classic and a good deal of BC) making the game challenging to the whole 1%-10% of the game's population that finds it too easy, they would lose a lot of players and a lot of money. WoW would either cease to be the game it is now or end up having its servers consolidated like many weak MMOs have had to do. Not only would they lose money, but that is just bad game design. This ideal is very reminiscent of old school design that was just simply bad. <br />
<br />
Take Sonic the Hedgehog 2. This is a wonderful game, I'm not trashing it. Anyone remember the last boss? Sure, if you managed to beat him the first time you encounter him, but that's only because you probably had a decent amount of rings to work with. Now, if you died that first time, you had to take him on with no more than 3 rings (or none, i can't remember which). This made the fight VERY difficult because with him, his vunerable spot was just within Sonic's jump range, and right under that was the guy's spiked hands that people tended to get nailed by. If you manage to win at this point it was a true feat. Take this from someone who beat Sonic 1 -3 and Sonic and Knuckles multiple times throughout their adolescence. <br />
<br />
Why did I bring up Sonic 2? Here's why. What many of these people want is raids to be like this final fight in Sonic 2. They want to bosses to be that difficult because they consider everything else boring. This type of ideal is bad for an MMO. First of all, imagine in order for you to succeed, you had to rely on 9-24 other people to be able to beat that final boss in Sonic 2 to succeed. Pile latency and disconnects on top of that and it just becomes not fun. This is what your asking for. <br />
<br />
This ideal forces players to be part of souless raiding guilds that players are only there for loot. For those of us who play the game not only for the game itself, but the coordination with fellow players who we like playing with, this ideal would cause us to never touch raids, but I'm sure you'd be completely happy with that. This is not what an MMO is about. If I wanted to play a game that's that hard, I would want my companions controlled by NPCs and the idea of a 'repair bill' being thrown out the window. <br />
<br />
To summarize, these changes are being made to keep the game healthy. If you want to continue playing WoW, then be happy they are there. If the majority of the player base is locked out of the high level content, the game will die. And also keep in mind Classic WoW had little competition on the market. Today is a different story. MMOs are everywhere. So, if you don't like these changes, go play another game. If its designed the way you want it to be, you won't be playing it for long cause it wont last.</div></div><hr />

That doesn't make my assertion correct, all it does is prove that quoting made up numbers to support an argument is fundamentally flawed. <br />
<br />
<br />
You were right, I didn’t have any “real” numbers on Ulduar because, unfortunately, none exits in any real format.<br />
<br />
What does exits, however, is www.wowprogress.com which tracks achievements of guilds as a tool for progress. The problem is that it doesn’t differentiate between guilds that don’t raid with those that do therefore there is a heavy shift as many social guilds or pugs are counted when they shouldn’t be (Uldar shouldn’t be puged developers have said several times already that it should require coordination and planning that the average pug shouldn’t be able to muster). To get “real” numbers though we can use the system provided we establish some given factors.<br />
<br />
The primary factor is that the guilds we are discussing, those who need help on the bosses that have been nerfed are able to kill flame leviathan. Obviously this is a given since FL wasn’t nerfed bliz obviously considers him “tuned”. So using wowprogress we find the achievement Take out those Turrets to be completed by 11691 guilds or 20.4%. If we set that number to our theoretical 100%:<br />
<br />
50.03% have cleared Seige of Uldar<br />
43.55% have cleared the Antichamber<br />
16.4% have cleared the Keepers<br />
5.6% have kill Yog<br />
And finally 0.05% have killed Freya on hard mode<br />
<br />
So my previous numbers were a bit off but not horribly so<br />
<br />
Is it a travesty that 49.97% of guilds who can kill Flame Laviathan can’t kill at least one of the other 3 bosses in the Seige? Not really its only been 3 weeks the fact that 50% of guilds HAVE is more telling that the fights are tuned just fine.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SFJake</div><div class="date">2009-04-29, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Casual guild here.<br />
<br />
One of our 10-man group (mine) downed Leviathan and XT after the nerf.<br />
<br />
Thats it.<br />
<br />
The other group couldn't even down XT because of all the drama.<br />
<br />
And no, we don't suck, but none of us is sitting in full epic gear, we never got to farm Naxx-25 (we beat it, but that was like... 1 week before 3.1?). So most of us have a bunch of gear still missing. I know I still have blues.<br />
<br />
Stop thinking you are a casual when you are not.</div></div><hr />

If he means by unoptimized as in the not the best gear, then yes. I really don't know what class your playing that can pull off that range with crapply optimized gear. Maybe casters, but surely not melee. Do you have any idea how hard it is to get optimized? I'm in 4/5 Valorous and I'm not hit capped or expertise capped (I use food/potions to compensate) on my rogue. Even if I went Mut on my rogue, I couldn't do it. I'd have to replace a few ap gems with expertise gems to compensate what I'd lose from the respec combat. I don't care how well you gem your gear, if your not in mostly epics your not hitting that dps range. I have 3 blues (2 of which I only have cause getting ahold of a ring that has expertise on it is a pain and I haven't had any luck running H GD. And then I'd have to). My weapons are pretty much crap but I can't help losing rolls on every weapon i roll on. So no, It isn't that easy. You can't do that kind of dps with bad gear, especially as a melee (I'm not counting you death knights). I think we all tend to forget that gear is usually a 'random' process. You have to hope the specific piece drops and you have to hope you win the roll. So quit spouting crap about that dps being easy to get, cause it isn't if you don't have some clue about what you are doing. I've been playing a rogue for over 2 years and I only get about 2.9k in a ten man out of my rogue. I'd like to think I have a decent idea of what I'm doing with him and hes got 3 blues and a green (the green is a trinket that procs with crit, its there by choice =) ). Now, according to your logic, I should probably be doing somewhere in the mid 3k range or higher if I &quot;knew what I was doing&quot;. If you consider knowing what I'm doing as in taking a cookie-cutter spec off the internet that I took no effort into designing myself, then I suppose I don't. Or wait, maybe I just don't have a guild that will carry me and get me gear to get that top dps. Oh, thats right, I lead my own cause I don't want to deal with crap from others. You elitists are becoming so delusional about how 'easy' the game is, to the point you start making up numbers. If your so bored with the content, try testing your theory. Level a character to 80 and gear them badly on purpose and see if you can pull of the numbers your spouting. I highly doubt you'll pull it off. If I'm understanding what you mean, you'll see about 1.5k-1.9k, at the most. 2k if your really lucky. <br />
Sorry on going on two rants on the same day, but somethings that have been said on this thread have rubbed me the wrong way. You super hardcores do not rule WoW. Remember, if the game was just played by you, it wouldn't exist, so be glad the 'casuals' as you like to call them, are around to keep the game you love running. Its also thanks to these people that we see so much free content. Other MMOs have to pay for everything new nearly. (No, I'm not considering raids as part of this cause I know they are technically part of the expansion).</div></div><hr />

What Blizzard is doing is wrong. I think they should leave the raid difficulty as it is. Only the truly deserving and &quot;hardcore&quot; raiders/players deserve to see these raids in their original form. Like they did back in BC when they took the nerf bat to Black Temple, they are now nerf batting raids that haven't even been in force on the live servers for 6 months. <br />
<br />
Again, there will never be a happy medium. Someone is always going to say &quot;This is too easy!&quot;. And yet another person will say &quot;This is too hard!&quot; Just like the Goldilocks and the Three Bear story. <br />

However, I AM going to say that I have no experience in trying to do Uld10 in 10 man gear. I'm giving you that. And maybe these nerfs should have been applied to only 10s. But you need to realize that you're talking in a forum where a lot of people of coming from a 25 man guild, and are crazy enough to be trolling forums because they're &quot;that into&quot; knowing about the game. We want challenges.<br />
<br />
The &quot;I have a wife, kids, job(s), blah blah&quot; excuse holds no water considering I'm watching people do the same thing as you (myself included, minus the kids) doing a lot better. I won't get dragged into a &quot;my life is real-er than yours is&quot; argument. Just face it, you're no special exception.<br />

To turn it the other way around: Who are you to tell us we need to keep going Naxx10 which IS pretty boring now because we worked on it... there is no hardmode for nax - there is one in ulduar... <br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, I'm going to bite on this one. I started off in a 10 man guild in WotLK because it was a group of friends. We wanted more action. We decided that we can still group up whenever, but we all joined larger guilds so we could go forward and I'm still friends with all of them, and we group together for shiggles all the time. We did what we needed to in order to progress. We grinded through the 25 man stuff, and now we can enjoy in the challenges of Ulduar. <br />
<br />
If you want progression, do what it takes to progress. If not, don't bitch because you don't win the game.<br />
<br />
TL;DR version: Ulduar 25 is fine. Ulduar 10 may be too difficult for Naxx10 casual guilds. Don't nerf 25, nerf 10. And take your Go To Hardmode(tm) bullcrap and cram it up your cramhole, LaFleur.</div></div><hr />

You aren't entitled to see everything just because you wish it so.<br />
<br />
Actually, YES. This is a game. While it is a MMORPG, it doesn't mean you have to waste 24 hours a week of your life to see the content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No they don't, that's they thing you shitty casual gamers don't get I don't think in every game out there everyone can beat it I can think of many game i quit on ps2 or xbox because they were to hard and yes I paid for them. Pre BC it was like that and people bitched but they kept playing it made the people who cared play better and learn the game so they could get into a guild that was able to see end game content. You should have to put forth time and effort to see end game content not just pay for the game, you dont pay for the game to see the whole game right away, blizzard wasn't saying you cant see the end game if your a casual player they were just saying you cant be a tard when you raid, and if you dont have the time to raid you cant expect to see all the end game.<br />
<br />
<br />
i know people are saying shut up go do hard modes but the normal fights SHOULD BE what hard modes are now and Hard modes SHOULD BE harder than the current hard modes id say hard enough to where only 10% or so of the raiding community can down them, now that's a challenge, thats how PRE BC was and thats how it should be.<br />
<br />
Whats the fun in raiding and getting geared when more than 50% of the server can do the same thing and has the same gear, just like from naxx you see a shitty player with Turning tide doing 2k less dps than you but hes still there becasue he doesent need to do 4k he'll be ok with 2k DPS.<br />
<br />
<br />
Where are the fights that require all players in the raid to play to their optimal performance and all dish out 5k DPS, wheres the BT and SWP of WOTLK?<br />
<br />
<br />
They need to take wow back to when it was a competitive raiding environment and people needed to know what the hell they are doing to be able to clear content. ( I dont give a shit about you casual players who think they should have everything for all the time they DONT put in, its not our fault you guys don't decide to put more time into wow because you want to do something else.)</div></div><hr />

Brilliant analysis. So, like you were saying, PS2 and XBox games usually have easy modes and hard modes. Usually you choose which difficulty level you want to play the game on. If you choose to play it on easy difficulty, the game is easy to complete and you get to see all the content. If you choose to play it on ultimate hard mode the game is very very difficult, but completing it often opens up new content or different play modes. Like you say, that's exactly like WOW now.<br />
<br />

Actually that is what Im saying, you can pick difficulties on console games, and there IS additional content on alot of games where you pick the more difficult mode, and it DOES take countless hours to be able to beat it if you even can.<br />

I find this casual entitlement more disturbing than the elitist attitude. Look at it in the case of any other individual sport, say cross country or track. What your saying is that you should be entitled to all the trophies everyone else gets regardless of how well you run. You paid your dues to get on the team and receive a jersey who cares you never went to practice and that you’re the slowest person on the course?<br />
<br />
The fact is that PvE is just as competitive as PvP (at least it used to be) and that by separating the good raiders from the mouthbreathers leads to a better game. By having super end game guilds, hardcore players, and dedicated individuals you gain web sites like these and teams to test encounters. If blizz continues to put out trash content and the hardcore players leave it's going to hurt the game as a whole.<br />
<br />
Sure end gamers only make up 10% of the community but they are the ones responsible for formulating boss strats, writing mods, running web forums, and are looked up to by there servers (regardless of how much you say you dislike them). Point is that a clear stratification of players is necessary to a healthy MMO if everyone gets to be the same the game gets stale everyone in T 7.5 lead to overall lower enthusiasm as even casuals complained of lack of challenges.<br />
<br />
These games are designed to have obstacles to overcome, the larger the obstacle the more gratifying it is to those that achieve it. Don't have time to shoot for the huge obstacles go for something simpler like working on pet achievements, professions, leveling alts, or rep grinding. There is more than enough content to fill the time for anyone who plays less than 14 hrs a week, raids were designed and implemented to fill the time of people who put in more than those 14 hrs. These people are the ones who make the game worth playing for everyone else and the ones who seem to get shti on every patch.<br />

You're equating a single players system to a multi player game. The problem is that the best items in the game (tier gear) is dropped of the bosses if they are normal or not and the heroic loots while having an extra 12 ilvl are often times sidegrades or in select cases downgrades from normal gear. If they made tier drops only drop from hard modes in exchange for easier normal modes would that be a reasonable solution?<br />
<br />
Point is players that put forth the effort to take down hard modes find the rewards to be underwhelming and oftentimes raiders consider it to be not worth the effort. Nerf normal bosses and move tier into hard modes and well be happy you can see the content just dont expect to get T8 any time soon.</div></div><hr />

The hard modes are difficult yes but the loot is not as good as it should be for getting the hard modes, they gear should be exceptionally better as a prize for beating the hard modes, but after a guild clears all the hard modes and has loot that is a couple points better here and there whats the point? I mean your guild can do the hard modes yea they get easy after you beat them a couple times but if someone who didnt do hard modes has just about the same gear, such a small difference that it does not matter whats the point? the gear that comes from hard modes should have the &quot;Omg I want that so bad how do I get it&quot; factor. Just like the Staff off of Illidan, which very few people were able to get.</div></div><hr />

Dissagree, the vast majority of the posts here by raiders are not saying that fights are too easy but in stead are trying to protect the fights we like from BECOMING too easy. If you look at www.wowprogression.com you know that the vast majority of guilds are still in the heart of Ulduar and that very very few are on hard mode encounters. Most of the posters in these types of threads love gloating and by &quot;QQing&quot; about fights they truely struggled on as being &quot;too easy&quot; it is a great way to focus attention on themselves.<br />
<br />
What is a viable concern, however, is the threat that Blizz by chain nerfing bosses will turn Uldar into the next Naxx something that almost everyone is against. Sure Naxx was run a ton by a ton of people who would have otherwise never have seen the fights but was it a sucessful practice? Players were rewarded with high level gear that was the exact same as everyone else on the server, and they participated in long arduous instance grids with very little boss kill satisfaction.<br />

Trying to suggest that you are in the majority and I am somehow a lone voice crying out in the wilderness is a bit like suggesting that Angelina Jolie is your girlfriend. You can say it's so, you can really really reaaaally want it to be so, but that doesn't make it so. There are dissenting voices, deal with it.<br />
<br />
And for the record, you can construct a neat little straw man from my argument if you want, but the reality is:<br />
1) I don't particularly care about 25 man. I raid 10 man, in 10 man only gear, and in my case, the rebalancing of the early bosses is, I feel, appropriate for their level within the Raid zone and their status as early optional bosses.<br />
2) Even if the changes were unwarranted and those bosses were made too easy, you now have a second tier of challenge within Ulduar which was unavailable to you in Naxx. If you're bored with facerolling the content and you've done it for 3 weeks, you now have the option of increasing your interest and the challenge of the fight (because those 2 are linked, right?) by going Hard Mode. Gearing up by facerolling the early bosses for a few weeks helps you with that and speeds your progression to the challenge of the latter bosses and thereafter the Hard Modes.<br />
<br />
My point, ultimately, was that nerfing a couple of early optional bosses is really not worth getting your panties in a bunch over. Now, if they nerf Yogg in a week's time so that the encounter is trivial, I may agree with you, but really with these bosses, who actually cares? A lot of this QQ is completely OTT...</div></div><hr />

<br />
And no, we don't suck, but none of us is sitting in full epic gear, we never got to farm Naxx-25 (we beat it, but that was like... 1 week before 3.1?). So most of us have a bunch of gear still missing. I know I still have blues.<br />
<br />
Stop thinking you are a casual when you are not.<br />

If your group is still sitting in a lot of blues, why are you not farming heroics and 10 man naxx. That is the proper progression path. Not &quot;3.1 is out, woo let's go do Ulduar. Oh shit, this is too hard, Blizzard needs to nerf it.&quot;</div></div><hr />

The razorscale blue fire is almost instant to get out of if it hits you. I agree with the chain lighting nerf; it wasn't because ppl weren't staying far apart from each other, it was because melee would overlap with range running back to emalon after dpsing the overcharge add and than the lighting chain would wipe out the raid.</div></div><hr />

Gearing up by facerolling the early bosses for a few weeks helps you with that and speeds your progression to the challenge of the latter bosses and thereafter the Hard Modes.<br />
<br />
My point, ultimately, was that nerfing a couple of early optional bosses is really not worth getting your panties in a bunch over. Now, if they nerf Yogg in a week's time so that the encounter is trivial, I may agree with you, but really with these bosses, who actually cares? A lot of this QQ is completely OTT...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Unfortunately there arn't any tracking sites for 10 man content and even if there was there would be no way to separate the players who outgear the encounter from those who run in pure 10 man gear. I have no problem with blizz nerfing the 10 man content to be more in line with 10 man progression paths. I think that's a valid plan and I wish you and your 10 man raid the best of luck but why 25 man? I have already shown that the nerfs wern't neccisary for the majority of guilds doing the content and while no this isn't going to detroy our progression attempt and dosn't effect the &quot;gear up&quot; stage many guilds are in its not fun fighting loot pinatas.<br />
<br />
Nerfing bosses expecially optional ones should be reserved for later in the progression timeframe not so close to release that the fights are still fresh and interesting. After 4-5 weeks of farming a boss he gets stale and the challenge subsides then nerf him but 3 weeks most guilds who have killed those bosses have done so maybe, maybe, twice. It's unwarrented.</div></div><hr />

Oi, stop gabbing - I killed Yogg saron, and it was not hard at all, sure we fiddled for 2 days trying to explain our melee that they really should not hug big tentacles = but it was an interesting fight! On the normal Ulduar its the only proper fight - and I have no doubt that whiners will have their way, nerfing it too into nothingness.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cerisan</div><div class="date">2009-04-29, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">These conversations get quite boring. Simply put:<br />
<br />
1. If the boss is too easy it gets boring very fast. That is bad.<br />
2. If the boss is too easy, then the time I've spent in maximizing my character's abilities is somewhat wasted. That is bad.<br />
3. If there is no content in the game that requires a high degree of skill, then the time I've spent in learning and training that skill is somewhat wasted. That is bad.<br />
<br />
Finally, as with any human endevour, people prefer the greatest rewards to be associated with the greatest effort and skill. If that is not the case, then that is bad.<br />
<br />
The early bosses in Ulduar were not Naxx easy. However, they are easier than *any* previous 25-man to date (except Naxx), given that you had mostly Naxx gear going in. They are easier than Gruul/Mags were for Kara geared folks. They are easier than SSC/TK were when in kara/gruul gear. They are easier than the 3-6 bosses in BT. Easier than Hyjal (although Hyjal was easy compared to vashj/KJ). Far, far easier than SWP.<br />
<br />
So I think it's a fair question to ask: How easy is too easy? The line will be drawn differently by different people - basically they'll say &quot;I should be able to do it with a modicum of effort. That's the right difficulty&quot;.<br />
<br />
For me, normal, pre-nerf was a bit too easy. Post nerf, again, to me, is a joke and not so much fun.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nissl</div><div class="date">2009-04-29, 08:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Casual player here. I don't have that much time to play anymore but I was looking forward to slowly working my way through Ulduar over a month or two a couple days per week and feeling some real accomplishment after getting it done. Why else would you play WoW? PVP is a disaster and people who care about social stuff in game need more IRL friends. <br />
<br />
Think back to BWL or SSC/TK, the other T2 raids. Guilds could go days or even weeks at a time on the same boss. People cared about progression. People cheered on vent after downing a boss. Go look at the forums now, people are complaining because they only have a couple bosses down or it took them more than a couple tries to down a boss. If another game came out with polished, challenging raid content, these would be the only people left.<br />
<br />
I thought progression rates were fine. Look at wowprogress, in 25-man half of the guilds who even took out a tower had all of siege done, and almost that many had antechamber done. The numbers are probably higher than that when you count PUGs or undergeared groups messing around with FL because it's so much easier than the rest of the instance. For exactly two weeks after instance release that is FINE.<br />
<br />
I can only assume that there will be further massive nerfs. Groups that were stuck on the early bosses, there's no way they're going to be doing something like Mimiron. And two weeks (!) from now, when the whole instance is nerfed to hell, the same whiners who got it nerfed will complain there's nothing to do.<br />
<br />
And don't say &quot;you're mad because other people can play with your toys.&quot; No, I'm mad because my toys are being replaced with toys designed for 10-year-olds.<br />
<br />
And don't just say hard modes are the solution. Right now the hard modes are massively detached from the easy modes. 500 guilds done with YS, only ~30 able to do hard mode Thorim. There are going to be a lot of server-first and faction-first guilds twiddling their thumbs in a week or two. And there is no way a skilled casual guild is ever going to look at these hard modes. Of course I guess they could nerf the hard modes into the floor too.<br />
<br />
Hard modes were a good idea for the hardcore guilds, now it's time to add a faceroll mode for the kids and idiots so they can see the lore while people with a brain can have some moderately challenging PVE content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
We actually have 25-man Naxx gear and are running 10-man ulduar. Yes, we have blues, but Epics from 25-man. It should even out. We are having troubles, but its doable. I can't say we whined about the difficulty, though. We are having fun.<br />

buy reset of cleared instance from BETTER players and go see the content. I am sick of bad players like you who whine about hard content which they aren't able to beat and cry for nerfs. It needs dedication but it also needs skills which according to your post certainly miss.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dakkuuan</div><div class="date">2009-04-29, 10:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, I think someone needs to step in and define what is a 'casual' and what is a 'hardcore'. I know myself and most players I know fall somewhere in between. Guess what, most casuals I know, real casuals, who quest and have fun, don't raid. I'm not talking about OS or Vault, those are just 'intros to raiding', something the game should have had in the get go. What some of you aren't quiet grasping is that the 'easier' content is meant to create a learning curve, like good games do. <br />
<br />
I hear people comparing dps to skill and I'm afraid the two have little in common. I know a hunter on our server that is brought along to every raid the guild does and her dps is good, always in the top 10. Yet, this person is absolute idiot in the fights themselves. Knowing which buttons to press to get high dps and looking up kind of gear you should be wearing doesn't make you a good player. Knowing how to handle the fight itself is what makes you good. <br />
<br />
This goes on to my next argument. Something needs to be done about the PTR. Every time Blizzard creates a new raid, they put it up on the PTR. They have players test it, which some perceive as a good thing. Of course, it has its bad sides. By the time the raid comes out to the live servers, its been tested to hell and back and there are already strategies written on it. I'll put good money that most top guilds have some, if not most of their core group's characters on the PTR. So when people test the fights and go back to their guilds with all that good info on how each fight works, they just have to make some minor adjustments to a strategy they knew long in advance. And people get surprised when Guilds on Live clear content so quickly. So next time you see a fast 'World First' clear of a dungeon, don't be surprised. Even if the raids get much harder, the top guilds will always clear them fast. <br />
<br />
I like the hard mode idea, but I think there needs to be a 'raid wide' reason to do this hard mode, not just an extra piece of loot or two. I'm in a lot of groups that don't want to even bother attempting hard mode sarth because the risk isn't worth the time and money its going to cost for the wipe. Have I been in groups that can do 1 or 2 drakes up, probably. Have any of them really wanted to attempt it, no. (Note I'm talking about pugs, good pugs without idiots with good overall dps, healing and tanks). Back to the point at hand, if Blizzard wants these hard modes to become popular, give the whole raid something that just doesn't happen once, like the titles that the OS 3d up hard mode grants. I wont bore you with my ideas, but I have some. And these things would have lead to visual (and stats) things that would differentiate the really awesome players from everyone else without causing 'everyone else' to not be able to progress.</div></div><hr />

You already said you're at least partially in blues. It would be a bit insane to think Ulduar was tuned for that level of gear when the epics in Naxx 10 and 25 were practically free.</div></div><hr />

I have 4 blues. 25-naxx epics, and I'm doing 10-Ulduar. A lot of people raiding with us have a bit more blues, but they still have 25-naxx epics. So technically, we should be able to complete it.<br />
<br />
And they are free now, but the guild went through a lot, having to grow up and pug half of our run to get to them. End result is it took quite a lot of effort to get gear, but thats only because of dumb people.<br />
<br />
Do you say Naxx epics are free because its puggable? Because I can assure you that I have never seen a pug go far. Patchwerk annihilated all pugs I went into. Otherwise it was not a pug, but half a pug.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you think the Bosses are too easy enjoy the hardmodes... they didn't get nerfed yet, but buffed ( see freya and leviathan ). So please don't cry until you didn't defeat every Boss in hardmode... after you've done you could... but probably would have been that exciting to defeat them all that you wouldn't complain anymore.<br />
<br />
p.s: we killed 5 Bosses today with a new raidalliance.. and now i'm sure this alliance will succeed... without the nerfs it would have probably been the end of the alliance right after the foundation ;-)...</div></div><hr />

I think there will go about 2-3 weeks and we will have atleast 50 guild @ Observer, world wide, and that is simply to early for a content that was spose to be Hard.<br />
As i see it casuals will complain bout the normal mode bosses until they are on naxx lvl, and then complain bout hard mode, coz &quot;I pay for the game like they do, i have the right to the same items&quot;, That was what they did with Sarthation 3Drake, (I know its not the same) and pug groups doing the hardest contest 2 months into expansion is just /facepalm, and i fear/think they will do somewhat the same with ulduar.<br />
About the Vanilla contest, no, i dont think it was harder, It was a new game, most ppl didnt know the aspect of their class properly, and having 40 ppl in a raid, u cannot avoid having atleast 10% being complete retards at that point, i think it was hard coz not the entire raid did belong there.<br />
And to those who think they can just storm into ulduar in blue gear, gtfo, go naxx and gear up there, cba with ur &quot;I went into ulduar with blue gear and wiped, nerf it plzzzzzxxxor!&quot;</div></div><hr />

Naxx is free epics, if ur pugs fail @ Patchwerk, find a new server. Naxx is faceroll content, and is the easiest content instance this game has seen by far imo, kara was Way harder, and imo, takes more skills to do WOTLK hc's then naxx, basicly half the raid can go afk, and still kill the bosses without problem.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VeeVee</div><div class="date">2009-04-30, 02:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally don't see the problem. This merely provides a linear difficulty curve from start to end. In some cases (ie. Ignis), encounters required a little bit too much precision given their position in the domino rally of Ulduar. If I was asked to sort each Ulduar encounter by difficulty (from easiest to most difficult), I'd probably say... <br />
<br />
Kologarn -&gt; Razorscale -&gt; Flame Leviathan -&gt; Auriaya -&gt; Hodir -&gt; XT-002 -&gt; Thorim -&gt; Iron Council -&gt; Freya -&gt; Ignis -&gt; Mimiron...<br />
<br />
I haven't done Vezax, Yogg-Saron or Algalon yet, but that's my experiences with the encounters so far, having DPS'd, Healed and Tanked all of the above.<br />
<br />
It was kinda weird that Ignis was so far down the list, and I personally felt it was a little too tight. It was extremely difficult with two healers and the timing between add spawning -&gt; add pulled into fire -&gt; add going molten -&gt; add being pulled to water -&gt; new add spawning was far too unforgiving. It was easy to fall out of the routine once and lose pace, particularly with poor compositions. It's relieving to know that the fights that previously favoured three healers can now be comfortably executed with two. It was a bit of a hassle having to log in my pally for just a few bosses each week.<br />
<br />
It should probably be noted that I'm about as casual as it gets. I spend a few hours each weeknight doing some dailies after work, and I put together some casual/alt/pug raids for about 8 hours on the weekends with a bunch of guildies and randoms from trade chat. I spent the last 3 years &quot;hardcore&quot; raiding from Lucifron through to Kil'Jaeden. Had I not been in a hardcore raiding guild, I never would have had the chance to see those bosses. I appreciate the fact that Blizzard has continued to maintain the hardcore option for those who still have the time and patience to commit to full-time raiding, whilst at the same time providing something accessible for those of us who simply can't make those kinds of commitments. My pugs are clearing the first 9 bosses in a single night, which I think is brilliant. We're not stepping on anyone elses toes, allowing us to enjoy the content Blizzard has developed, whilst the Hardcores still have something to strive for.<br />
<br />
Half the problem with the so-called &quot;hardcore crowd&quot; these days is this:<br />
1) They call themselves hardcore because they knocked over everything 3.0 had to offer, which was a recycled instance and a mediocre pair of single bosses with no new concepts. (I pugged Undying &amp; OS3D on my Alt - pretty hard right?)<br />
2) They think that all content should be exclusively available to them, and that casuals don't have the right to experience the same encounters they do. Drop the ego and sense of entitlement - everyone else pays the same monthly subscription you do. There's no reason why &quot;casuals&quot; should only recieve half the product because they don't play the game as much as you do.<br />
<br />
For an interesting analogy; two guys walk into a clothing store. They both buy the same shirt, for the same price. The &quot;hardcore&quot; concensus is that one guy shouldn't be allowed to have buttons on his shirt, because he's not going to wear it as much as the other guy. Doesn't that just strike you as ridiculous?</div></div><hr />

sure, the next patch u can ask to add a button to fight or skip the boss, so u can go ahead and see Vezax, Yogg-Saron and Algalon<br />
the 1st night -.-<br />

i've really hoped that uld would have been a new AQ or more like the old nax..<br />
something different from the other content, something more exciting. <br />
This major nerf has kill any hope to see a difference between some1 that play 1 hour sometimes and some1 that dedicate to the game more time..<br />
<br />
yesterday evening we have do all untill freya in a 3hours run .. and we aren't an highend guild..<br />
i was more than bored.. and like me almost all my raid.<br />
<br />
i think that in a week we are at the end of uld, and in a month the hard mode will be done.. and then for &quot;non<br />
casual ppl&quot; that anyway &quot;pays the same monthly subscription you do&quot; there'll be anything to do, if not leaving this game that is becomnig a game for 5-9 years old players...<br />

We want to allow additional players to experience more of the cool Ulduar content. &quot;<br />
<br />
Ok so here's my beef. This is the 3rd week its been out. People are beating these encounters, some more slowly than others. For our 10 or so best players, its slow. Granted we only have time for 1 or 2 nights a week to spend a few hours, but we are getting 1 additional boss each week down and the slow progression of things being a challenge is fun. Its going to suck a little wind out of our sails when the fights we really worked on all of a sudden seem simpler. Maybe just slow down with the nerfs a bit so that people progressing have time to progress and after a little while open up the gates to general population? I'm not looking forward to the day(and that's going to be soon if they read these nerf-notes) that some of the really bad well geared players in guild start complaining that they should be able to go... the difficulty/skill requirement was a sanctuary from them.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SFJake</div><div class="date">2009-04-30, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok so why does your own raid/guild fail in Ulduar then?<br />
<br />
Cleared everything sans Algalon first week, including Ignis before fixes :P Ulduar is a rude wakeup call to the guilds who facerolled Naxx and now expect the same thing in Ulduar.<br />
<br />
<br />
Because no one is hardcore. We had troubles in NAXX. Generally, there are people that are undergeared, some that are not very smart, some that just sucks at doing something like MOVING around. Casual troubles, you know. If you make sure everyone in the guild does 5k DPS on patch, then its hardcore (for example). While we have &quot;minimum requirements&quot;, are not hard on them.<br />
<br />
I can personally say I would fit right in in an hardcore guild, I adapt easily and almost always succeed at what I'm asked. Not bragging - nothing is ever really &quot;hard&quot; - but a LOT of people have troubles in the simplest of things. Thaddius, anyone? Even with the FOUR POINT SYSTEM, we still couldn't redo it last time because of a few people.<br />
<br />
<br />
Normal, casual guilds will deal with these things. Hardcore will not. Another point: Almost everyone can't raid out of weekends, and fridays, and not everyone can raid 10 hour in a row (and we rarely do).</div></div><hr />

If ur good @ playing Soccer, u get to be in premier league, whatever, if ur not as good, u stay in small countries and small clubs playing &quot;casual soccer&quot;, what u want is to play in premier league, even tho u do not have the skills to it, and u wanna nerf the lvl of Premier league, so the good soccer players cant get a challenge anymore..<br />
Hard mode bosses will be a challenge from now and 3 weeks forward, then that is on farm, and we have nothing els to do, other then practicly quit wow til the next content patch.<br />
<br />
I know it sounds wierd to compare soccer to wow, but only way i can explain it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll bite...<br />
<br />
The issue here is, the gap is to extreme. it's akin to you having a decent, but nowhere near world class team, but your only choices for opponents are to take on 10 year old soccer teams, or get stomped by the top teams in the EPL.<br />
<br />
Normal mode is quickly transforming into faceroll mode, while hard modes got buffed, to the extent that normal guilds would not be able to beat them, even though faceroll mode was cake for them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The first thing that was said was that it would change the PVE lvl, it would be hard on all aspects, and challeging, see what happend, they are nerfed to the lvl just above Naxx lvl. <br />
Now they say they will keep hard mode hard, but for how long? As i said, it wont be long before casuals get tired of doing normal mode ulduar, they will complain bout hard modes not being for them aswell, after all we all pay the same amount of money for this game, Max 1-2 months, and they start nerfing Hard modes, just like sartharion (Feel like repeating myself) that was pugable in the end of 3.0..<br />
we will see if blizzard Blows this game up once again and nerfs all hard mode aswell. time will tell</div></div><hr />

You're obviously not doing very well. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
sure, the next patch u can ask to add a button to fight or skip the boss, so u can go ahead and see Vezax, Yogg-Saron and Algalon<br />
the 1st night -.-<br />
<br />
i've really hoped that uld would have been a new AQ or more like the old nax..<br />
something different from the other content, something more exciting. <br />
This major nerf has kill any hope to see a difference between some1 that play 1 hour sometimes and some1 that dedicate to the game more time..<br />
<br />
yesterday evening we have do all untill freya in a 3hours run .. and we aren't an highend guild..<br />
i was more than bored.. and like me almost all my raid.<br />
<br />
i think that in a week we are at the end of uld, and in a month the hard mode will be done.. and then for &quot;non<br />
casual ppl&quot; that anyway &quot;pays the same monthly subscription you do&quot; there'll be anything to do, if not leaving this game that is becomnig a game for 5-9 years old players...<br />
<br />
ty for ruining this game with ur QQ <br />
<br />
ps sry my bad english<br />
I'm not sure how I ruined the game with my &quot;QQ.&quot; To clarify, I had no complaints with the instance. I just find it logical that you can now comfortably progress through the first 11 bosses with the same composition, rather than having to accomodate for precisely tuned early encounters by throwing in an extra healer. I don't see how your comments regarding a button to skip bosses is relevant... I think your English comprehension is letting you down here.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I wanna try compare this to Soccer,<br />
If ur good @ playing Soccer, u get to be in premier league, whatever, if ur not as good, u stay in small countries and small clubs playing &quot;casual soccer&quot;, what u want is to play in premier league, even tho u do not have the skills to it, and u wanna nerf the lvl of Premier league, so the good soccer players cant get a challenge anymore..<br />

You know they've repeatedly buffed the hard modes, right? Have you completed them all yet? I'd reserve your complaints until you have.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't mind nerfs if they are done after some months not less than 6 or so, let the non hardcore guilds appreciate the content slower but with the same dificulty. I went yesterday with a new guild try X2 that we only tried 2or 3 times with wipes before patch and in 25man we did it 1st try, this is a joke....<br />
Congratulations, you killed the 2nd boss of the instance which introduces brilliant new concepts such as, &quot;Move away from other players when debuffed&quot; and &quot;AoE down the adds.&quot; Are you really pulling a high and mighty whinge without even viewing 75% of the instance? How can you complain about &quot;joke&quot; content when you haven't even completed it yet?<br />
<br />
<br />
it wont be long before casuals get tired of doing normal mode ulduar, they will complain bout hard modes not being for them aswell, after all we all pay the same amount of money for this game, Max 1-2 months, and they start nerfing Hard modes, just like sartharion (Feel like repeating myself) that was pugable in the end of 3.0..<br />
You're looking at it from the wrong angle. They won't nerf hard modes as to provide accessibility for casuals. You clearly don't understand the (blatantly obvious) design scheme behind the current raid model. The base content is available for everyone. That monthly subscription entitles you to see the same bosses as everyone else. Of course, this doesn't please the hardcores, so they develop an additional layer on top, which is the same fights - except with different methods of execution. This content is optional, and by no means is it necessary in order to progress in 3.2. I guess the best comparison would be the Achievement system itself. You can just be a casual player and enjoy running Heroics, 10-mans and PvP: no-one's forcing you to invest 75k into buying all of the mounts available in the game just so you can complete an achievement. But if you're hardcore, then the option is there for you. <br />
<br />
It's pretty wild how single-minded people can be.</div></div><hr />

Raiding is a joke, and &quot;hard mode&quot; is a sad way to keep the retarded little kid wow zombies to keep paying the monthly fee for a crap ass dungeon experience.<br />
<br />
Reading these posts makes me realize how shitty the wow community has gotten.<br />
<br />
Making content hard as hell so only a small population of an MMO can experience it is far more intriguing and eye catching than an MMO that puts everything on brain dead mode and hands out loot like there is no tomorrow. Nothing is impressive anymore. There are no characters anymore that can wow you with their gear.. because the next poor sap next to you that probably never saw half the shit you did is just as geared as you now. So now the better players have cool titles? Mounts? Achievements?... Please that shit is wack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hard mode&quot; is a stupid, lazy way to not add more dungeon content and only makes the things you are doing that much more repetitive. I'll take another raid over a hard mode of the same raid anyday..<br />
<br />
Enjoy flying every week to the same zone, same instance, fighting the same bosses (&quot;on hard mode&quot;) for a couple of extra epics and titles for months on end.<br />

As opposed to the previous three years where you &quot;flew to the same zones, same instances, fought the same bosses (on one mode with no variation in difficulty or execution whatsoever) with no incentive, no additional rewards and no titles for months on end.&quot;<br />
<br />

If you think raiding is dead now, what was it before? At least now you have options and goals. Before it was just &quot;show up every week and repeat the same mindless tasks until you're drooling on yourself.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
THe defrence on now and BC is that Bc was more challeging, it required skillz to kill kil' jaeden before nerf, Ulduar requirs gear, nothing els. I dont belive u have done any hard mode in ulduar, most fights is just a question &quot;Can ur tank take a 45k crit?&quot; if not, u wipe, if he can, grats u got a kill. our tanks got 1 shot, only reason we could not kill it before, so y, wow that is quiet some hard moding there... <br />
with the &quot;Wow effect&quot; of gear, yes.. most ppl pre bc did not experience Molten core, onyxia or bwl. Zg was tops for most ppl, so having epic gear back then with only rank 12-13 being epics other then the 20-40man instance, made a wow effect, ppl inspected ur gear in orgrimmar, ppl said &quot;Nice gear&quot;. Ppl saying that these days is rare, coz even the most retarded 10 year old can get full epic. Therefor i think most ppl look back on pre bc as the best time of wow, and that is, imo what Blizz so go for in a upcoming expansion &quot;The Emerald Dream&quot;.<br />
Wotlk is so borring PVE wise, im alrdy looking forward to next expansion, sick.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The incentives in Pre BC and Vanilla were much much much bigger then a couple of achievements and mounts. If raiding was the same as it is now, minus the hard modes, you would be right. But you can't compare the difficulty of AQ40, NAXX, and BT, Sunwell and and old raid progression with WOTLK's. <br />
<br />
Options and goals were to be among the top guilds that could actually clear hard end game content. That doesn't exist anymore. It does in the form of cute &quot;hard modes.&quot; <br />
<br />
I rather have worked hard back then for gear that not any average joe could get, then work hard to differentiate myself from the noobs with a stupid title anyday.</div></div><hr />

Now it is just a matter of which servers that are first online on patch day, who got the most spare time Irl (Putting myself out as a no lifer, but anything to defend pre bc pve difficulty), and having all contest cleared after 36 hours of raiding (Gj Ensidia). while there in naxx pre bc went well over a few months before any1 had killed kael'thuzad. And ppl back then didnt complain bout the content, u had to fight hard to get to epic gear, and the reward of being &quot;Wow'ed&quot; @ in Ironforge/Orgrimmar was reward enough (for me atleast). If we could bring back this time in wow, i would never consider quitting again, as i have been doing quiet a few times.</div></div><hr />
