Patch 4.3 will be the &quot;largest content update since Cataclysm&quot;<br />
It will be released later this year, which means that we can probably expect a PTR soon. <br />
<br />
<br />
It's also worth noting that despite the loss of players, Mike Morhaime pointed out that the new trial system resulted in an increase in new account creations.

Cenarion Hatchling Raises More Than $1.9 Million for Japan Earthquake Relief<br />
Thanks to the overwhelming generosity of World of Warcraft players around the world who purchased the Cenarion Hatchling (http://us.blizzard.com/store/details.xml?id=1100001530) pet, we’ve raised a total of more than $1.9 million USD to support the ongoing earthquake and tsunami relief efforts in Japan. In May, we announced (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/2717672) that for every Cenarion Hatchling purchased by July 31, 2011, 100% of the $10 USD adoption fee would be going to assist victims of this disaster -- and the community responded by opening up their hearts and wallets wide. Thanks again for your support and for helping to make an impact on the lives of those affected by these events.<br />

Diablo III Beta Profile Update<br />
The beta test approaches! We’ve just updated our System Check program and would like everyone to update their Battle.net Beta Profile information by running the new one. You should do this regardless of whether there have been hardware changes made to your system.<br />
<br />
You can run the new System Check by visiting the Beta Profile settings of your Battle.net account:<br />
<br />
https://www.battle.net/account/management/beta-profile.html<br />
<br />
I don’t have a Beta Profile<br />
If you haven’t yet created a Beta Profile on your Battle.net account you’ll be presented with two download options, PC and Mac, for our System Check program. Running the program will present you with the Beta Test Opt-In Agreement, and once you agree to that it will immediately query basic computer specification information such as your type of video card, processor, and RAM. Clicking the Send button will then upload the shown information to your account.<br />
<br />
On your Beta Profile page, you’ll want to ensure you at least have “Diablo Universe” checked for future testing, if not StarCraft and Warcraft as well. That’s it! You’re now eligible for future beta test opportunities.<br />
<br />
I have a Beta Profile<br />
If you’ve previously uploaded your system info you should use the links to download the new System Check program for PC or Mac and update your system info. Run the program, read through the Beta Test Opt-In Agreement that appears, and once you agree to that the program will immediately query your basic computer specification information. Click Send and the program will automatically update your profile with your system specifications. You’ll remain opted in for whichever beta tests you’ve previously selected, and you can change these selections on your Beta Profile page at any time.<br />
<br />
Having current system specifications and checking the franchise boxes to express interest in beta testing our future products does not guarantee your entry into the beta test. We will grant a very limited number of people entry from the entire pool of those interested, based on their system specifications and other factors. While having an official Battle.net Beta Profile is one way to potentially get in, we’ll have information on other ways to increase your chances as we draw closer to the beta test. <br />

Blue Posts<br />
Lack of Blue Posts / &quot;Where are the Blues?&quot;<br />
The whole team is here today. We're actively reading the forums whenever we can while working on other tasks. :)(Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/188935/where-are-the-blues) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2927095614?page=1#10))<br />

Repair costs too expensive?<br />
Repair costs have always scaled with item level. If anything, I'd say this game has a burden of too much gold out in the economy, rather than too little. 4 deaths in 1 5-player Heroic dungeon run is well above what you should expect as an average, and 100 gold is pretty easy to come by at level 85.

Forget two. They're going 3 or 4. Plus atleast 2 dungeons. <br />
<br />
Seriously though, I think that Blizzard will pull their weight in this patch, and for the 300k sub lost, in Q3, we have - WoW Brazil, Chinese Cata, 4.2 Resubs, so I think they game will stalemate there.</div></div><hr />

that's like saying wow's playerbase of 12 million people is constituted solely of fat, greasy nerds living in their mom's basement<br />

<br />
You realize they announced releasing content faster just prior to releasing 4.1 don't you? So we really have nothing to judge the speed of their content release on yet until 4.3 is released. With it coming out by the end of the year it's at least within the typical 6 month time table of major patches.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This doesn't really mean much since we've just had baby patches so far. I would hope they could match up to the icc patch if 4.3 is deathwing, 3.3 came with 3 5mans and a raid.</div></div><hr />

Not biggest ever, biggest since Cataclysm, basically a 4.1 and 4.2 combined, I would assume.</div></div><hr />

WoW is fine, l2p <br />
<br />
/sarcasm off <br />
<br />
4.3 Will bring you new epic raid, with 5 bosses and 2 dungeons, 2 bosses each! Since WoW fans cried for old sets, we decided to bring them back with buffed stats! In Addition new questing hub shall be created, with 10 daily quests in total. Rewards are amazing! A snake pet, a tabard, food, and recipes! As a sneak peak of what waits for you, we can say one thing... &quot;... it was only a setback!&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then what's the point of raiding? It's nice to have stuff not every other person on the server has. T11 is easily accessible right now you know right? After the nerfs you have to actual try hard to wipe the raid on MOST bosses. <br />
<br />
Oh and me having a near full heroic t11 set makes me a hardcore raider? Not really. Oh and why the need for the best raid gear obtainable if all it's used for is doing 5 mans?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Isn't the 600k in the exams period (Schools , university ) and the 300k in the summer period ? Plus 4.2 and Cata in China wasn't released yet in Q2 .</div></div><hr />

<br />
In May, ActiBlizz reported WOW's membership numbers at 11.4M after losing 600K. So this would take them down to 11.1M, not the original 12M before the lose of 900K over the last two quarters. So if we want to take a number from 12M...they've lost 7.5% of the player base so far. <br />

I don't think WOW is dead...it is just getting old for those of us that have been with it since the start. Things get repetitive and boring. Still love Blizzard, but interest has faded and time to try something else until the next XPac - if it is even worth coming back for. I would expect WOW's numbers to continue to go down until the next Xpac, especially with TOR launching at the end of the year. They'll probably see a loss of 300-600k from that, combined with other factors. I would not be shocked to see the player base fall below 10M unless there is a massive bump from Brasil. Not a bad thing though...it can serve as a good kick in the pants to the higher ups that they messed up with Cata and do better going forward.</div></div><hr />

It's most likely 300k whiny people who can't get exactly what they want the way they want it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm one of those 300k and I'm not one of the &quot;whiney people that didn't get what I want&quot; that you speak of... As someone above me said, I've been playing this for 6+ years and the game is becoming stale. I'd rather leave and be thankful for the fond memories the game has given me.<br />

<br />
I am willing to bet, historically, WOW hasn't seen a massive subscriber shift during the conclusion of the school year. Some, but not 600K worth. I would expect a dip in the summer however, but it is going to be tough for them to get people back in the fall with competition ramping up from TOR. It is probably going to be flat to negative growth for the next 12 months until the Xpac rolls out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously though, I think that Blizzard will pull their weight in this patch, and for the 300k sub lost, in Q3, we have - WoW Brazil, Chinese Cata, 4.2 Resubs, so I think they game will stalemate there.<br />
<br />
Don't forget that the 4.2 resubs were included in the q2 report. They're down around 1 million subs since Cata launched. Spinning it as &quot;Well, there's at least 10 mill still playing!&quot; only goes so far. <br />
<br />
Blizzard's problem is that it cannot put out high quality content in a limited amount of time. Blizz promised more frequent updates so that content could be released as it's finished. It split 4.1 into two patches (five mans and half-size raid), but hasn't even bothered to announced 4.3 yet. Blizzard's updates are getting slower, which does not help when the content in these updates is barely compelling to begin with.<br />
<br />
The gamer paradigm is changing, too. Why spend $15 to play a game that's played out when you can spend $15 to play 5 games that give you multiple hours of play on mobile os or Steam? <br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I love WoW and love Blizzard games. WoW just has some fundamental development problems that have to be solved in order to stop bleeding subs. I don't care what anyone says to the contrary, losing 8% of your customer base in 6 months is terrible.</div></div><hr />

How can the 4.2 resubs be included in the Q2 report if 4.2 was released in Q3?<br />
<br />
Keep in mind they also announced releasing content patches more frequently just before releasing 4.1, so we really have nothing yet to seriously judge them on for this announcement as we have yet to see the next major patch after 4.2. So far they're keeping their word, by releasing a 5 man and then a raid shortly afterward while typically having only done that every 6 months before. <br />
<br />
4.2 has been out for 5 weeks now and you expect a 4.3 announcement already? Some of you have seriously flawed expectations of what they should be able to accomplish.</div></div><hr />

I swore 4.2 was released in June. You do realize that people said that the next earnings report (the one that was released) would show that people came back after 4.1, right? So now it's 4.2 that'll get a boost and next it'll be 4.3 that'll get a boost. There's no guarantee. 4.2 was an extremely lackluster patch.<br />
<br />
Content patches from now on are supposed to be more frequent and smaller. 4.1 was a half patch. 4.2 was a half patch. Based on what we've been told to expect, 4.3 should be a half patch. The only content that 4.2 introduced was a half-raid and the most tedious daily hub to date. Now they're promising 4.3 will be the biggest content patch since Cata launch. So now they're waffling on faster releases. That's a big problem if they expect <br />
<br />
4.2 was announced the week after 4.1 to prove that they would be releasing content faster. We're 4 weeks overdue for a 4.3 announcement. We'd have to have an announcement in the next couple of weeks for 4.3 to even be out before Blizzcon.<br />
<br />
Edit: 4.2 was release before the end of the fiscal quarter. June 28, according to Wowpedia.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. Blizzard has ruined the game with catering to such people. And now that Diablo will offer stuff for real money, it's only a matter of time before it appears in WoW and that will be the end. I'm just happy i got to play during vanilla and BC. Since i quit in the begining of WotLK, most of the game will still be in good memory for me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beyond2</div><div class="date">2011-08-04, 05:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Then what's the point of raiding? It's nice to have stuff not every other person on the server has. T11 is easily accessible right now you know right? After the nerfs you have to actual try hard to wipe the raid on MOST bosses. <br />
<br />
Oh and me having a near full heroic t11 set makes me a hardcore raider? Not really. Oh and why the need for the best raid gear obtainable if all it's used for is doing 5 mans?<br />
<br />
the five pieces that compose the tier set still leaves two trinkets, the weapon slot, neck, rings, wrists, back, and feet. There's many, many slots left to fill that don't involve tier; also, as anyone will tell you, a tier set piece is slightly worse than a similar item of that ilevel, since the set bonus is incorporated into its stat weight. So someone wearing 5 pieces of tier from a dungeon would be better off with at least one of them being swapped out for a raid drop.<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, I don't need 'the best raid gear' - I never said &quot;HEROIC RAID TIER&quot;. I said Tier Set. that's it.<br />
<br />
And why? Because it's my goal in the game to collect an armor set. Humor me, what set is there for a casual to complete? You say tier 11? I tell you NOPE, blizzard left the token requirements on, aka Nef or cho. I do not raid; I do not enjoy raids. in WotLK, I could, slowly but surely, obtain the tier set over a long period of time. by the time I was celebrating my last tier piece, the raiders were halfway through heroic modes and had not only better loot in EVERY OTHER SLOT, but they had the same tier suit I did, with some pieces heroic level. <br />
<br />
That was what I played for. Each expansion, I looked forward to collecting my tier set. That was what motivated me to play. Locking two pieces? the ONLY TWO PIECES with unique polygons? Yeah, blizz can go fuck off until they fix this. If you want your unique raid loot, go get your Sulfuras, the extinguished hand, or some other awesome drop loot. If you want me to pay for your raids each expansion (admit it, raids get the most budget put into them) then you've got to give me something to work for. <br />
<br />
And &quot;why get better gear&quot; WHY PLAY? Wow is an RPG at heart - the game is all about increasing numbers to increase performance so you can increase other numbers. The game only gets easier with better loot. But more to the point; please direct me to the DUNGEON SET I can collect as a dungeon grinder?<br />
<br />
WHATS THAT? THERE ISN'T A DUNGEON SET? Gee imagine that. They could put in a dungeon set for people like me to work for. instead they give us hand me down raider gear with half the set locked away behind raid end bosses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm fairly confident that 4.2 was released Q3, and is confirmed by a mod on this forum. But if I'm wrong by all means please correct me. I also believe that, in regard to people claiming 4.1 would increase numbers, that the 4.1 'expected increase' was when 4.1 was expected to be Firelands as well. I highly doubt people would expect a serious increase after 2 5 man heroics being released.<br />
<br />
Why should you expect 4.3 to be half a patch when it's confirmed to be bigger than 4.1 or 4.2? How are they waffling on faster releases if they have yet to prove that? All we know is 4.3 will be bigger than any previous patch of this expansion. For all we know it could be out in 2 months. So they have yet to prove their announcement of faster content patches wrong yet. <br />
<br />
You're forgetting the fact that the Firelands raid was being designed while 4.1 was being designed as well. We have yet to find out if that's the case for whatever is in store for 4.3, so we shouldn't just assume that an announcement for it should come so quickly after a major content patch like 4.2. We'll likely get information on it before Blizzcon, with Blizzcon being more focused on Deathwing's raid and the next expansion. Obviously I'm just assuming that.<br />

<br />
i'm pretty sure the main reason they're losing subs is that the game is too easy for anyone who can get the same 10 people together one day a week for 3 hours.<br />
<br />
i call bullshit on casuals. you're not casual, you're antisocial. you cannot possibly hand out more loots or water down the game any more than it is already.<br />
<br />
<br />
they give you tier items AND THEN WHAT? sit around and do nothing with it? because you're not raiding, or else you'd already have a way to get the items. you just want a perpetual carrot, you can't stand it that you've gotten worst than the best gear and that's it. so? they add tier pieces as &quot;easy to get&quot; and you're now complaining that you cant get heroic. they give you heroic and you complain that you cant get the optional boss gear.<br />
<br />
bottomline is raid itemization should only be accessible to raiders, because thats all its useful for. you opt out of raiding, you beat the game when you finish the last set of daily quests / grind the last rep. <br />
<br />
<br />
sorry, but everyone i know that quit is because its way too easy to beat the raids and they have no interest in silly grinding to beat heroic versions which are not different / unique enough to matter to them. they are just sick and tired of <br />
<br />
1. chasing the carrot<br />
2. gear reset every expansion<br />
3. constant fiddling with balance<br />
4. things STILL out of balance randomly<br />
5. pvp boring / arenas have too much dependence on comps and not enough on skill<br />
<br />
etc. etc. i personally enjoy the few hours a week i put into wow and its cheap enough that even if i didn't play i'd keep my sub going.</div></div><hr />

Sure they are coming more frequently but not as fast as they made us think. Now they are promising &quot;The biggest patch in CATACLYSM&quot; really? I sure as hell hope so considering we did not get a whole hell of a lot with 4.1 or 4.2... I did enjoy the Molten Front Daily quests, they were a nice change. Though, Firelands was rather disappointing in certain aspects. Forgive me, I am tired but that's pretty much what we got in 4.2 was it not? A new Daily quest hub and a rather small raid. I can smell disappointment with 4.3 from a mile away - I do hope I am wrong though. As for the loss in subscriptions, this and SWTOR's release might actually kick Blizzard in the ass to do SOMETHING creative with WoW. New Battleground, new Raid and a few more dungeons will be great for a while. In my opinion they need to take another look at Rated Battlegrounds...</div></div><hr />

The time and effort aren't worth it for raiding anymore. I say more open style daily bosses with a fixed reward system. Make solo or 3 man dungeon content, make open world PvP town based objectives(Like capturing Tarren Mill or the Crossroads) award conquest points with a 3 hour down time for recapture. Just some ideas.. WoW has really become lackluster and boring. Though that could be because I had played for 5+ years. I feel like the entire game is under potential, obsolete, and half assed.

The time and effort aren't worth it for raiding anymore. I say more open style daily bosses with a fixed reward system. Make solo or 3 man dungeon content, make open world PvP town based objectives(Like capturing Tarren Mill or the Crossroads) award conquest points with a 3 hour down time for recapture. Just some ideas.. WoW has really become lackluster and boring. Though that could be because I had played for 5+ years. I feel like the entire game is under potential, obsolete, and half assed. I doubt I'm alone.<br />
<br />
I agree, they need to do something new.</div></div><hr />

I'm so uninterested in it that i don't bother doing even the dailies now to cap valor. who cares? eventually i'll have more valor than i know what to do with, and the worst part is you don't even need full gear to beat the raids. by the time i get to the point that i would have needed it, it'll be nerfed anyway.<br />

You simply can't hide from the fact that making content more accessible actually loses subscribers faster because there is no prestige or value associated with obtaining items. <br />
<br />
when it was *required* that you were 1 out of 40 people in a raid and had to dedicate time to obtaining upgrades, people CARED more. Now they don't, because anyone with any amount of skill can beat the content in last tier's gear. Zzz.<br />

they hand casuals the ability to raid and the casuals ask for &quot;tier loot without raiding.&quot; <br />

<br />
And why? Because it's my goal in the game to collect an armor set. Humor me, what set is there for a casual to complete? You say tier 11? I tell you NOPE, blizzard left the token requirements on, aka Nef or cho. I do not raid; I do not enjoy raids. in WotLK, I could, slowly but surely, obtain the tier set over a long period of time. by the time I was celebrating my last tier piece, the raiders were halfway through heroic modes and had not only better loot in EVERY OTHER SLOT, but they had the same tier suit I did, with some pieces heroic level. <br />
<br />
That was what I played for. Each expansion, I looked forward to collecting my tier set. That was what motivated me to play. Locking two pieces? the ONLY TWO PIECES with unique polygons? Yeah, blizz can go fuck off until they fix this. If you want your unique raid loot, go get your Sulfuras, the extinguished hand, or some other awesome drop loot. If you want me to pay for your raids each expansion (admit it, raids get the most budget put into them) then you've got to give me something to work for. <br />
<br />
Wait... so you want a raid tier set but you don't like raiding? To bad then because it's a raid tier set that requires you to kill raid bosses to complete the raid tier set. I'm sorry but this is kind of like my original point... you want something that you aren't willing to take the time and effort to get yourself and you're getting upset that you can't get it handed to you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
sorry, but everyone i know that quit is because its way too easy to beat the raids and they have no interest in silly grinding to beat heroic versions which are not different / unique enough to matter to them. they are just sick and tired of <br />

3. constant fiddling with balance<br />
4. things STILL out of balance randomly<br />
5. pvp boring / arenas have too much dependence on comps and not enough on skill<br />
<br />
etc. etc. i personally enjoy the few hours a week i put into wow and its cheap enough that even if i didn't play i'd keep my sub going.<br />
<br />
You make a lot of assumptions. First and foremost, it has nothing to do with &quot;having the best of the worst&quot; - on the contrary, during WotLK I was perfectly satisifed with my base tier-10 loot set. I never once complained about how hard tokens were to get, I never once asked for heroic loot to be passed out to anyone with a pulse. Do you know why that is?<br />
<br />
I'll give you a hint. Look at the blues you could get for running heroics when tier 11 was still current content. Take all the plate DPS pieces, or all the plate Tank pieces and put them on at the same time. Looks coherent, right? but utterly dull. It looks like it was something that was made on the lunch break of one of the employees. <br />
<br />
Compare that set to ANY TIER SET FROM 11 OR 12. Any one. Any of those sets have coherent everything, and typically have bells and whistles. Glowing eyes on the shoulders. A hood that obscures the face. Some factor that makes them look cool. Some factor that makes YOUR CHARACTER look cool. <br />
<br />
At the end of the day, i care about my avatar looking halfway decent. Blizzard has made having a cool avatar something only raiders are allowed to do, and that isn't acceptable if they want my subscription money.<br />
<br />
and as for what to do when I have my full tier set? Why, good sir, I start working on my full tier OFF set. Gives me something to do, a reason to play. Being told &quot;oh you can only get 3/5 tier&quot; is like telling me &quot;You have no goal to work for&quot;. No goal to work for? No subscription money.<br />
<br />
Bear in mind - back in Wrath, which is the model I think worked best, casual dungeon running took far, far, far longer to obtain raid emblems. so it would be months to finish my tier, BUT AT LEAST I COULD. I'd keep playing till the raid after firelands if it meant I could finish the tier.<br />
<br />
<br />
You'd think they'd have thrown a bone to casuals and at least make the old armor set buyable for points - herp derp NOPE.<br />
<br />
<br />
Frankly, we can argue back and forth all day. At the end of the day, I spoke with my money, and I hope blizzard keeps losing subs until they fix what they broke. At that point, I'll resub and happily play. Until then, I'm done paying blizzard to develop for raiders when I'm not one.</div></div><hr />

As sick and twisted as that sounds, maybe blizzard will wake the fuck up and make tier accessible to non-raiders like it was in WotLK. Or at least give casuals something to do with rewards that aren't recolored rehashed shit, while raiders get all the new shinies. The new quest zone was a joke; I saw the rewards, I saw how little they value their casual players. &quot;Just give em recolored rares, they'll eat it up. toss in a recolored mount too for kicks&quot; No thank you blizzard, my money will go elsewhere. Make your game casual friendly like it was in WotLK and we'll talk about me re-subbing. If it takes another 1,100,000 people to leave to make a round two million, I hope blizzard it will get blizzard to fix their shit. I want to play WoW, but not in an environment where I have no hope for obtaining an armor set unless I'm a hardcore raider. You can get most of your valor cap for the week solely by running trolls and random heroics, so unless you're complaining about getting your 2set too quickly as opposed to several weeks of daily heroic grinding in wotlk, not much has changed (or WILL change) in terms of casuals and their &quot;hard earned&quot; shinies. Just because you think the latest tier is badass or whatever and you want to show it off in 5mans and bgs as soon as possible, doesn't mean blizzard is suddenly going to change their mind about how it's distributed. Just wait around for however many nerfs it takes until you can pug the raid or just forget about getting geared from raids period.</div></div><hr />

you seem to have a general issue with english, what they're saying is pretty clear as the largest PATCH since the release of cataclysm. That's not saying much. 4.1 and 4.2 were not exactly massive.

Gimp content that took a month to clear with no artificial time inflating like resistance check fights and limited attempts?<br />
<br />
Just because content being more accessible to you makes the game less interesting doesn't mean that's the case for everyone. You're also expecting the game to be what it isn't any more and hasn't been for a very long time now. Yet you blame Blizzard for that when they obviously have gone a completely different route with the genre that no one else has before? You do expect too much from Blizzard because you expect this game to be what it isn't, hence my statement about ridiculous expectations.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Halicia</div><div class="date">2011-08-04, 05:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Considering how long 4.2 took and how shit 4.2 was I can't really see how you call it 'flawed expectations'. If they can't meet player demands that sucks - for them.<br />
<br />
Well, the major flaw to this, imo... is that 4.2 is all content that was originally supposed to be released 'soon after launch' as part of 4.1.<br />
<br />
If 4.3 isnt announced SOON, then its likely the we'll reach a year since launch with only 1 new raid and 2 &quot;recycled' dungeons to show for it.<br />
<br />
If we're also looking at the new expansion next year, then that leaves about enough time for the scheduled 2 tiers of content before the pre-patch.<br />
<br />
What I suspect though, is that whatever ill is plaguing Blizzard's development process will force them to skimp on one (or both) patches, aggravating the issues we've seen since the launch.<br />
<br />
Remember when everyone said the 600k drop was just a 'seasonal thing, and you'll see it bounce right back' ? well... it didnt.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying WoW is dying, but there's certainly a sickness that the membership drop is a symptom of.</div></div><hr />

Based on all the warcraft realms reports, we know that the big dropoff in player participation is actually in year 2 after the content is finally milked dry. Blizzard is stalling a bit with their raid release cycle, but typically we'd see the end-raid (Black Temple, ICC) in the november/dec period....probably this time they'll launch a new raid in the october timeframe, and the deathwing raid sometime next year. By then it might be too late -- GW2, SW:TOR, and a ton of other games... and Rift is getting more solid each and every day too (the dark horse in the mmo market). WoW isn't going anywhere, but the sun is setting on the dominance of WoW ... and probably the better of the whole MMO industry. &quot;Peak WoW&quot; was mid-Wrath.</div></div><hr />

I do not enjoy raids. I will not do content I do not enjoy for the sake of getting gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't want to show it off in five mans &quot;as soon as possible&quot; i was content to wait for three or four months back in Wrath doing my daily, every day, slowly accumulating enough frost to buy my tier 11. I don't want it fast - i want it eventually. I just need a carrot on that stick that I know i can eventually reach. Right now, blizzard is adamant against providing me my carrot. <br />
<br />
And as far as blizzard 'suddenly changing their minds' about how loot is distributed - I'm going to be loud whenever they announce more sub losses. I unsubbed before firelands. I kept up to date on the patch, and when I saw they were still fucking non-raiders, I decided to not sub.<br />
<br />
See, it isn't about what you &quot;think&quot; people should have to do to earn armor. If I can't get a complete set of armor from running dungeons, my preferred gameplay, then I WILL NOT PAY BLIZZARD.

There's many, many slots left to fill that don't involve tier; also, as anyone will tell you, a tier set piece is slightly worse than a similar item of that ilevel, since the set bonus is incorporated into its stat weight. So someone wearing 5 pieces of tier from a dungeon would be better off with at least one of them being swapped out for a raid drop.<br />
<br />
<br />
WHATS THAT? THERE ISN'T A DUNGEON SET? Gee imagine that. They could put in a dungeon set for people like me to work for. instead they give us hand me down raider gear with half the set locked away behind raid end bosses.<br />
<br />
Just thought I would let you know that although it's not a true set with bonuses. The troll dugeon gear all matches and looks like a complete set.<br />
<br />
<br />
OT: I think people are leaving now because leveling is so much easier. A lot more people have max levels of every class where as before, in Vanilla mostly but BC as well, it took a long time to max out a character. When some one got tired of their class they could re-roll. This could take months to max your character. Now, you can get BOA's and hit 85 in a solid 2 weeks from scratch. This meens people get board of that character faster. It gets to the point where you have made enough alts that you just get burnt out and don't have anything else to do. Wow world is getting smaller and smaller. Old content, outlands, northrend are dead areas with very few players and the new content is just so fast. It takes more or less 1-2 days to go from 80-85. They need to make leveling slower. More content. Better mixture of raids / dungeons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And you'd be utterly gimping yourself if you chose to use that complete set over the 359 tier you'd earn while completing the troll set. <br />
<br />
Also, lets just sweep under the rug that all that armor is identical to the level 70 raid version. It's not a new armor set, its old models with inferior numbers slapped on it.</div></div><hr />

etc. etc. i personally enjoy the few hours a week i put into wow and its cheap enough that even if i didn't play i'd keep my sub going.<br />
<br />
<br />
alright i just picked the most interesting post here .. and you are right about few things and you wrong alittle <br />
<br />
i have been playing this game since the release :) since the age of warriors one shotting people around '' if anyone remember '' and we enjoyed and luagh till we met the sweet UBRS raid with the amazing blues and greens we never looked at little things like heyyy GS or kick ! achive OR KICK all tho we care about you dps or hps doing ^^ '' it just show how active you are in raid '' aka the great world log :) in vanila we enjoyed zg ony mc aq20 aq40 bwl till naxx 40 and believe me there was people who can not obtain tier 1 even which is from MC but they were happy with some blues and greens running around with Mace of AV ^^ '' those lovely warriors '' EVERYONE was happy untill TBC came our talents changed our legendarys become a trash of 3 months of farm on legendary ! we had ilidan that actually drop it easly in your hands .... ive lost my sense of gaming in that time ... <br />
but ! i found that in every expansion there is something that makes me '' enjoy '' in TBC arena created , it was something new and everyone rushhed to season 1 and BAAAAAAm! sorry ill call it the cursed expansion '' wotlk '' came with silly class .. the class that ruined other class's and made blizzard fuckedup and running out of options but then after 1 month the game met the point of 50%50 balanced lol .. oh damn i cant even remember what season was it but anyway in wotlk seriously we had nice instance - ulduar - amazing creation , blizzard had alot of subs in these days ! specialy on The crusader patch totc thing but the game become worse till the end of the expansion so we moved to cata .. and seriously guys cata was the best expansion so far tho we still havt seen much in cata but till now i feel like im playing the age of vanila with too many spells on my characters .. you talk about balance ? huh baby there was no balance since day 1 :) yes i play all class's and i know that 1v1 there IS no balance the game wasnt meant to be 1v1 ... tho one thing is BAD about nowdays than before .. i believe the game should be MORE harder in heroic PLUS i agree with some posts here about '' same gear but with different colors '' seriously blizzard i have no comment for that i mean lol even my son can draw better than these new items ... and RE-DO /RE-Colored is not going to work '' not in wow not in anything in this world ... even in sex you cant just fucking the same hole every day all day and every year its just boring at the end -.- anyway i think this expansion is great and arena is amazing atm .. dont qq about setups you just have to find your way out against every setup and create good setup and play .. just stop picking x3 mages and go like YEY we have alot of nova's now and 3 sheeps we will kick everyone ass and end up with 1.7 rated lal so the game is fine and we need harder heroic encounter with better items looking ^.^ and daily firelands is amazing finaly i can enjoy ganking and if you cant gank just run away little girl :) hmm what else ... gear reset every expansion YES man it should be and thats the fun in it :) your gear has to be changed its NOT like single player mode .. leme ask you do you wear the same T shirt everyday and forever !?!? simple :) <br />
the game is fine people .. stop being weirdish enjoy every change in the game but seriously dont go nerdrage -.- i heared people saying '' bring back TBC or Vanila servers and shit but LOL even on those days I BET no one will play wow because there was also one shot around alll the time and ganking all the time no balance at all Lol '' old players will agree with me '' simple request '' just .. find .. your .. way .. out '' thats for arena peeps and pvp lovers :) and for pvers i have to agree with you folks the game needs some HARDER heroic .. and making the gear actually harder to obtain just like whats happening with pvpers that they cant get weapons untill they earn amount of blah etc .. anyway thanks for reading i just typed alot and im tired cya :)</div></div><hr />

If you look at it, Wotlk statistically was the best time in wow, when the subscriber population peaked at around 12 mill. Something in wotlk raised the player &quot;population cap&quot; of wow. That said, cataclysm was suppose to bring back a burning crusade / vanilla feel to the game. By the looks of it, the game is easing back into Burning crusade / pre-early wotlk levels.</div></div><hr />

WoW is no longer ground breaking, and it's just getting old. Every empire falls. Everquest went through the exact same thing, and then WoW came out and basically killed the huge profit margin Sony saw in the game. It's still alive, and still turns a profit, so it'll be around for awhile, but no one would ever believe it's still relevant in the MMO world.The Old Republic has a good chance of being the WoW killer. The conditions are about the same as when WoW came out - 5-7ish year old game, an increasingly bored player base, and a lack of innovation. Which isn't to say there isn't a lack of content, but take raids for example - I can't be the only one who looks at a boss and says 'ok, so this part of the fight works like this boss, with these minor changes', and so on. Things like cross-realm dungeons, and battlegroups haven't helped any either. They've managed to erode the sense of community that a server used to have.It's virtually guaranteed that ToR will have a dramatic effect on WoW. If Bioware delivers a stable and fun game, it'll have a permanent effect on WoW's subscriber base. If they deliver a train wreck, then folks will be back to WoW in a few months time, but right now, the market position is BioWare's to loose.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No doubt WoW is good, if that maybe decent, it is decent on many levels for many things -- that is why it attracts so many people, Blizzard makes it that way. However, the game isn't great, its just &quot;meh&quot;, it is perhaps entertaining enough to just keep u dumping time into it, but never being truly rattled or inspired say like an Metal Gear Solid Game or even its predecessor Warcraft 3. I never had an awe inspiring moment in WoW. Most people just play WoW BECAUSE of the network effect, it started off huge (for its time) and grew quickly because it was a popular IP (very damn popular) which fed its growth from day 1, a lot of people still play because of the people (guild and friends) not because of the game.<br />
<br />
What does this mean? It means that Blizzard as of how it is now, is probably not going to lose or gain people with a few balancing tweaks, and more numbers, numbers and numbers, and making us do the same old roller coaster we did for the last 5+ years. The gameplay is stagnant dull, the AI is rather simple (I call it &quot;dumb&quot;) especially the way threat works, boss fights are all just tanks and spanks after I have done them for 6 years, its freaking old.<br />
<br />
<br />
A lot of people stuck around like me through WotLK, because Blizzard dangled another carrot besides loot -- that they would listen to us (GC was very vocal then, but then became all balance and number oriented and then it got nasty on the forums) and would be bringing some major changes and innovative content in both WotLK and Cataclysm, Especially Cataclsym. To me Cataclysm didn't rock my socks, or anywhere near, was a total let down, a lot of the class revamps sucked, standardized and homogenized BS, they took the wrong route on for most classes, and just made their rotations more complicated, which is still boring to me. Changes like standard hunter pets, lose of the old Ret style, they nerf to the old AoE ways for the most part sucked, dispel system and what classes and roles could do. The problem was just in tuning then, some abilities &quot;OP&quot; or underpowered.<br />
<br />
-Regardless, class changes are very minor issue to me still, I am really disgruntled with the content in the game. Why can't they shake things up, over multiple dungeons that vary in sizes from 2-8, whoever the hell they want instead of standardized 5 mans that get boring are some super long small group runs (that have things like 3 day- 1 week lock outs)<br />
<br />
-Some real game affecting open world PvE and PvP which is also rewarding to, not just an easy faceroll or simple grind.<br />
<br />
-Rid us of random BG and dungeon bonus, and remove or change boring BGs to the PvP player base (if there are any) and create some new BG maps, wouldn't it be nice with like a DoTA style PvP map in WoW? You know some new concepts besides creating a Second AB, though it is a good thing to have more options, BGs should have Catagories like capture the flag (WSG), King of the Hill (EotS and AB, Gilnaes), Conquest/power struggle (AV - please go back to the old one), SotA kind of is whatever u would like to call it, i hate it, but we need more categories (pvp focused) with many maps each.<br />
<br />
-Tweak the trinity system, AI, how tanking is or could be down, or allow everybody to tank but &quot;tanking roles are slightly better and merely &quot;slightly worse on dmg no matter what spec, if they can tank as their class. AI like Faction champion bosses would be nice, excluding the ridiculous healers in there that ruined the fun of it, that are more complicated than hit same dude with most armor just because he is &quot;the tank&quot; and ignore everybody else while they boringly stand style and mash a rotation on their keyboard (no more fun than me typing this post here). Give everybody the burden and responsibility of support roles through first aid, BUFF it and bandages (not make is so u can heal entire progressive runs as a first aid player) but as a secondary thing where it isn't 100% healer (i'd like to see amount of healing required in this game cut in half or maybe less, and nerf all heals while giving all heals, temporary buff effects, damaging effects and buffing healing role damage). Also cutting how OP a healer is in PvP teams, vs not having one.<br />
<br />
-Shartuul's Transporter and Bash'ir raids, not many people got to see this, many people struggled through (so did I a few times) but we need open world challenging events like this. Look them up if you haven't heard of them, VERY FUN sheeit.<br />
<br />
<br />
-Give us some real damn lore, where the heck did the cinematic team go, Warcraft 3 still has big ol huge WoW beat on awesome Cinematic count by nearly 3 times as much, don't give me BS that it is hard to introduce, just introduce it somewhere, people will QA it and will know how to deal with it in game, not freaking hard (wrathgate wasn't a failure on any amount) but why not go full CGI or more in game cutscenes like the old Warcraft3, I am almost afraid to say it might be too late, it would've done wonders for the past 5 years of the game to do, which Blizzard didn't.<br />
<br />
-Making leveling Raid, challenging content, not for max level, and open group stuff that isn't so scripted or tuned to be played with a certain number, comp and certain way, just to be fun with friends, with a more they merrier attitude.<br />
<br />
-Ever look into giving more classes resurrect(even if its just one person every 10 minutes type CD), I mean you see it in other games, why would it hurt here, it just puts lets stress on those who are expected to res or partial wipes?<br />
<br />
-1v1? At least vs your own class? Whats the harm in competing against exact same classes for ranks?<br />
<br />
-Having things like in game jumps provide new obstacles puzzles and challenges, things on the side of raiding, or in the open world of their own category.<br />
<br />
-AoE and hit box centric spells for players and content at hand, why can't it be more reactive and on the fly, especially by players. I would like to see AoEs, cheap easy, maybe more passive (not channeled) and deal some good damage in PvP so there is some stuff to avoid (a bit easy to avoid) and ways to create obstacles and do neat things with. Instead of dismissing them as garbage. We need interesting spells like that, not like warriors or hunters for example (probably every class) that have &quot;different&quot; spells with minor scaling and stat differences but do the exact same thing -- damage, just plain old damage too. When people start playing D3 I doubt people are going to say &quot;omg AoEs are OP single target damage stuff should hit like 6 times harder&quot; I know its different game but my point remains the same, this game could use SOME of that style in it. Things liek cone of cold or dragons breath are good candidates yo know?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Things like this type of thinking or innovation is just not present AT ALL in this game, devs don't give a hint of discussion to it, rather responding to player balance QQ about PvP or raid dps being 3% lower than somebody else. I mean seriously these aren't serious or game breaking/making issues get over it, people that have been playing this game for a long time (I consider 2-3+ years a long time) are going to get bored from the same old stuff, doing things like I merely suggest are just some of possibly many more things Blizzard could do to. Guess what they don't Have to be exactly what I say or as I said it, just suggestions, well thought ones, more than most replies I get. I only talk about them in such ways because I KNOW without a doubt I may not speak for 10+ million people here, but I definitely don't speak for myself, I have talked to many others personally and people I have worked with being one involved in the gaming community as a whole.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Masternewt</div><div class="date">2011-08-04, 06:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It makes me happy to see more people leaving the game. As sick and twisted as that sounds, maybe blizzard will wake the fuck up and make tier accessible to non-raiders like it was in WotLK. Or at least give casuals something to do with rewards that aren't recolored rehashed shit, while raiders get all the new shinies. The new quest zone was a joke; I saw the rewards, I saw how little they value their casual players. &quot;Just give em recolored rares, they'll eat it up. toss in a recolored mount too for kicks&quot; No thank you blizzard, my money will go elsewhere. Make your game casual friendly like it was in WotLK and we'll talk about me re-subbing. If it takes another 1,100,000 people to leave to make a round two million, I hope blizzard it will get blizzard to fix their shit. I want to play WoW, but not in an environment where I have no hope for obtaining an armor set unless I'm a hardcore raider.<br />
<br />
Here's a suggestion for you that might help you cope with WoW as well as help you further in life. Sit down, take a deep breath and say these words out loud: &quot;I'm just a spoiled brat who wants things handed out to him.&quot; Better? Now let me elaborate, even though I'm sure that in your long career of QQing, people have already pointed this out to you. <br />
<br />
You don't have time to raid, but you want raid gear. You refuse to find time to raid, but you want the best the game has to offer. You want to invest a maximum of 7 hours per week game time in WoW (to run 7 5mans for VPs) and you want the same gear as raiders? That, my dear mental pantient, is a very unhealthy delusion. You share it with about 3 million other spoiled kids who wandered into WoW and figured they can get 90% of top gear even if they have no skill, no dedication and any formidable brain capacity, so you figured you might just as well whine to get the whole 100%. You think you're right, because you see other kids of your stature posting similar threads wherever possible. <br />
<br />
Nowhere in life you will get everything for just showing up. Raids take from 3 - 9 hours a week in average and if you can't schedule your life around to put that much time into what is supposed to be your hobby, then just slowly back away before you hurt yourself QQing for stuff you don't deserve or need. If you have time to browse MMO, read forums and whine about how you should get EVERYTHING for doing NOTHING, then you might eventually find the time to get into a raid. I am sure you have 12 alts with 200 days /played on each at least, and this post is nothing but a poor attempt at blackmail, but from what I've seen, it's not kids like you who quit - it's people who took WoW as a hobby, wanted to be good at it, but it ended up being massacred to please whiny babies like you.<br />
<br />
Now take your 10/17 TOP OF THE TOP game pieces that are handed out to you for autopiloting through 5mans and quietly GTFO.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">greyghost</div><div class="date">2011-08-04, 06:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">that's like saying wow's playerbase of 12 million people is constituted solely of fat, greasy nerds living in their mom's basement<br />
<br />
i think 300k people leaving a 7-year-old game is justified considering the core gameplay is getting stale<br />
<br />
I agree with this, for the most part. There's a slew of new MMOs coming out this year (with Rift proclaiming that they stole a chunk of those subscriptions, although I see that more than half of their servers are sitting around at 'low' population even during peak hours). Blizzard needs to find a way to cater to more non-raiders to hold up those subscription numbers -- more 5-man dungeons is a good, albeit small, step towards that. Daily quests/questing hubs... they worked 3-4 years ago as 'exciting new non-raid content' (ie, during the Burning Crusade era) but now it's just an assumed chore that everyone undertakes. <br />
<br />
In my opinion, Blizzard needs to give people reason to go travel out and about in the rest of Azeroth, in a way that makes them explore and take part in a living environment... something akin to the Undead invasions pre-Vanilla Naxx and pre-WotLK. Make people look at all those zones that just got overhauled in a way that doesn't require people to constantly level alts or achievement grind. Phasing technology demonstrated with this patch (a level 80-81 zone turning into a level 85 playground while on certain quests) could be the groundwork for a longterm solution. Consider it a 3rd teir of endgame content, like Instanced Raiding or Instanced PvP. Then we'll have something.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's virtually guaranteed that ToR will have a dramatic effect on WoW. If Bioware delivers a stable and fun game, it'll have a permanent effect on WoW's subscriber base. If they deliver a train wreck, then folks will be back to WoW in a few months time, but right now, the market position is BioWare's to loose.<br />
<br />
While I do see a lot of fanfare and positive reviews for SW:TOR, I've also seen an equal measure of reviews that are warning that the game is structured too similarly to WoW in such a way that the gameplay isn't quite as new and innovative as many would hope. The same could also be said of Rift actually... considering the two level 50's I have sitting in the game, I sorta left it when I realized it'd be &quot;Grind [ heroic dungeons ] which are tuned-for-50 versions of the low-level dungeons, they drop [ justice points ] which you need to get a bunch of to buy [ epics ] so you can begin doing raids&quot; all over again. I also took issue with their sluggish physics engine and uninspired visual style... but that's just me.</div></div><hr />

I want to be pretty!&quot;I really don't see what else you're complaining about.Although I will admit a return of d sets would be fine. Hell yeah d2.<br />
<br />
Pretty much the last line. I still fail to see why the old tier can't simply become dungeon tier. How hard is that?<br />
<br />
I play to look like a fantasy hero. If I can't look like a fantasy hero, I won't pay my sub.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, &quot;I don't want to work&quot; gets tossed around a lot. A dungeon a day, every single day, for 4 months, IS WORK. Sorry your raider mind can't wrap your head around that, but that's a lot of hours invested, in actuality, far more than you put out in your raids. <br />

I'm not saying wow is dying, all I'm saying is it has definitely lost something, from Wrath to Cata it feels like it is missing something, I have no idea what it is, but it just doesn't feel right. Since about 3 months after Cata was released I've felt burnt out playing wow, I mostly log on to just do raids, then log off. It feels like more of a chore then a hobby, and I think that might be a reason why people have been unsubscribing. Really hope this isn't the beginning of the end. :(</div></div><hr />

I will personally come back to WoW in a heartbeat if they implement the following.<br />
<br />
1) Make villages/towns/cities capturable through PvP (excluding starting zones of course) and retakeable also through PvP.<br />
<br />
Why? Because it would make both RP and PvP infinitely more interesting and dynamic.<br />
<br />
2) Make all named mobs elite and make elites tougher.<br />
<br />
Why? Because if something is supposed to be the toughest of the lot, it should be hard to beat, not killable by just pressing an extra one or two buttons.<br />
<br />
3) Random powerful elites patrolling every zone except starting zones and villages/towns/cities.<br />
<br />
Why? It teaches you to be awake, keeps you on your toes and teaches players the importance of being alert and moving out of the way when something nasty is coming toward them.<br />
<br />
4) Bring back questlines such as the Linken one in Un'Goro Crater.<br />
<br />
Why? Because quest chains like that, that are just a massive reference to some of the best loved things in pop culture, really add a new shine to WoW and the items you get will be the pride of your collection (My Linken's Sword of Mastery certainly is).<br />
<br />
5) Bring back the D1 &amp; D2 sets and maybe add more.<br />
<br />
Why? Why not?<br />
<br />
6) Change the badge system so you have to farm gear the way you had to in Vanilla and use the badges to buy vanity pets, mounts, specific gear (such as nature resistence or fire damage etc) and so on.<br />
<br />
Why? Because the idea of being able to buy the best gear with currency is rediculous, it should all drop from raids like it did in TBC with each tier spread out over several raids.<br />
<br />
7) Make the raids harder and take away the PvP drops from the bosses in Baradin Hold and Wintergrasp.<br />
<br />
Why? Because both raids and PvP should be hard, they should require enough time and effort that if/when you get that best gear you are truly recognised as one of the best players in the game, not somebodfy who probably beat the raid post-patch and got welfare epics because of it.</div></div><hr />

It is BLIZZARD'S JOB to provide a game that the players want to play. In my case, as far as the game is concerned, I want to earn my gear in an environment I find fun. READ MY POSTS before you make inflammatory claims. <br />
<br />
In a way, you're right, I don't want to WORK for my gear. I want to PLAY the GAME, in a way I find FUN, and obtain gear as I do. I have fun in five-mans. I do not have fun in raids. I still want to have an armor set to work toward, a milestone to accomplish. This gives me incentive to play, and more importantly and more relevant, incentive to PAY blizzard. <br />
<br />
Also, 10/17 of the top of the top pieces? Get the fuck out. The top pieces are heroic items, and those require effort to get. Sorry your normal mode epics don't have the prestige you want, go try heroic if you want your purples to mean something.<br />
<br />
And even if I humor your excuse, then why in the FUCK does that justify leaving the token requirements on the helm and shoulders of the old set? That isn't the best of the best anymore, its mediocre. It's old. But it's still locked. Similarly, they won't even make a dungeon set for 5-man players to collect. There's extra colors of the tier in the game files that goes unused; they could turn that into the &quot;current tier 5 man dungeon set&quot; but do they? nope. Not a single bit of incentive for the five man player. <br />
<br />
At the end of the day, blizzard refuses to cater to the non-raider, and it's costing them in spades. You can sit on your soap box and call anyone who doesn't want to raid for their loot a whiny, spoiled kid, but in reality, blizzard is going to listen to the lost subs instead of the person calling names.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's easy to push out monthly updates when the 'world events' are formulaic and you're pushing out raid content that's been preplanned for over a year. <br />
<br />
The grind of rifts and daily quests for tokens to buy vanity gear, vanity pets, titles and stones that make you glow funny from vendors v3.0 to herald a new raid! This is nothing like the Undead invasion or the Earth invasion! Oooo! This is so different from WoW holidays, where I grind tokens from daily quests to buy vanity pets and outfits and titles! Super!<br />

It is BLIZZARD'S JOB to provide a game that the players want to play. In my case, as far as the game is concerned, I want to earn my gear in an environment I find fun. READ MY POSTS before you make inflammatory claims. <br />
<br />
The gear you earn in the environment you find fun -- as you've expressed over and over -- will unfortunately be less powerful than the gear earned in raids, then. Hum diddlededum, dum. The simple fact about Raid gear is that you get better gear the more effort you invest into it. If your effort is going to be spent just doing daily quests or doing heroics over and over, then you're still in the middle of the pack. If you're achieving in the middle of the pack, then you're going to get rewards akin to being in the middle of the pack. If you're able to shoot out 50,000 DPS while elegantly kiting Meteors then you can graduate from the ilvl 365 gear to the ilvl 391. <br />
<br />
The unfortunate thing about WotLK's reward system is that they made the mistake of making the final teir of content trivialized and negated the overall achievement of actually making progress in 10-man Icecrown Citadel. A gear game that can be essentially 'won' by repeating low-teir content repeatedly to get high-teir rewards trivializes the game and removes the incentive to actually do content of the game. <br />
<br />
That is, if you can get a full set of, say, Teir 14 gear by just doing Heroic Deadmines over and over... you're not going to ever want to do the other 3 raids in the expansion. You're just repeating what is the first month of endgame gameplay as intended by design for 2 years, just to ignore months 2-18 of content. That's not good, innovative gameplay. And game design that allows for it is not good game design.</div></div><hr />

<br />
4.1 was a non-patch to any raider. No upgrades available = not interested.<br />
<br />
I'm so uninterested in it that i don't bother doing even the dailies now to cap valor. who cares? eventually i'll have more valor than i know what to do with, and the worst part is you don't even need full gear to beat the raids. by the time i get to the point that i would have needed it, it'll be nerfed anyway.<br />
<br />
they've taken away any requirement for me to worry about flying through content because it is simply so easy to do so. Shrug.<br />
<br />
You simply can't hide from the fact that making content more accessible actually loses subscribers faster because there is no prestige or value associated with obtaining items. <br />
<br />
when it was *required* that you were 1 out of 40 people in a raid and had to dedicate time to obtaining upgrades, people CARED more. Now they don't, because anyone with any amount of skill can beat the content in last tier's gear. Zzz.<br />
<br />
they hand casuals the ability to raid and the casuals ask for &quot;tier loot without raiding.&quot; <br />
<br />
you can spend less time in firelands than it takes to do a random heroic in a pug and clear a boss or two. on my server they're pugging heroic FL already.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
blizz can't win. people whine about content being too inaccessible, so they make it easier and then people whine about there not being enough. Oops, kids clearly have no idea about things like development budgets.<br />

<br />
7) Make the raids harder and take away the PvP drops from the bosses in Baradin Hold and Wintergrasp.<br />
<br />
Why? Because both raids and PvP should be hard, they should require enough time and effort that if/when you get that best gear you are truly recognised as one of the best players in the game, not somebody who probably beat the raid post-patch and got welfare epics because of it.<br />
<br />
7 sounds like you want to be a special snowflake ...<br />

Achievements are for standing out from the crowd .. not gear.<br />

Until they actually make achievements account-wide, it's not worth it. The fact that you have to redo them on every character you want kills the fun of being able to play a variety of characters, and just contributes to the boring same ol same ol outlook. I mean, seriously, doing the Argent Tournament on *5* different toons just about drove me batshit insane.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That, and a profession system that is broken. A Token System that is Broken. <br />
<br />
Note to blizzard, when you raise the item level Cap, WITH ANY CONTENT PATCH, give all the crafters a reason to be who they are!!!<br />
For instance... RIGHT NOW...<br />
Inscriptionists should have at LEAST 1 365 Off Hand Recipe, Shoulder Enchant should have buffed slightly<br />
Engineers should have a 365 Helm, and the Gun, and at least a buffed tinker (HEY BLIZZARD, NOT ALL ENGINEERS ARE HUNTERS YOU MORONS)<br />
Blacksmiths... OMG, did you give them ALL THE CASH THIS PATCH?? WTF but aside from that, given their self buff is sockets on gear only they can get sockets on. Not sure what you can do aside from making the gems increase in level or add a socket bonus on the wrists and gloves based on highest stat.<br />
Alchemists Stones should go to 365<br />
Tailoring, Leatherworking they did get some new bags.. so I guess that is something, Self buffs should have increased<br />
Enchanting - Ring Enchants should increase<br />
Jewelcrafters, buffed Jewelcrafter only gems.<br />
<br />
That's the most frustrating part of wow to me, is the time you take to make a crafter only to have Blizzard systematly poop on a few of you each patch. Take some time and give your professions what they deserve EACH TIME YOU INCREASE ITEM LEVELS!! Its not that hard you lazy sob's. Want me to lay out the coding for easy modification when needed??</div></div><hr />

SIR, SIR! Your complete thought process of playing this game and your self entitled privileges you thing you gain for being a shitty casual who thought Wrath of the Bitch was a good expansion it wasn't outside of Uldar. The natural state of the game in that created soo many bad retarded casual players who can't raid or &quot;want&quot; to raid, you are in the wrong game and lazy ( atleast some of the baddies try'd and then were properly cussed out for being terrabad). Yes, all of the game's yummy treats are for the most part in your grasp one week at a time minus the teir gear the real way. You do 5man dungeons all day in your cramped 1 bedroom apartment in some shitty suburb town. thinking 5man are the greatest form progression to obtain your shiny pieces of gear, if you aren't whoring Chaos Orbs you may as well be retarded for not crafting and atleast making a bunch of gold to buy yourself shinys yes because in Wrath people where doing that if you remember if you aren't too retarded to remember back about 18 months ago. Too bad People won't carry your sorry ass cause people have to pay attention alittle bit but quickly move on cause everything has been nerfed into the ground. Yes , Raiding is a must if you want your trail of shinies, if you don't want to have your teir set. Go play a different game please and save us the time and energy trying to explain you your err and retardation and complaints. its dumb and immature to think that they are going to hand you fucking everything on a platter saying heres your new legendary and and 4/5 teir and best in slot, but sense you want the whole set you drop a teir for being a gear whore who doesn't want to work for anything and is content running in his little hamster wheel complacent with his life never trying. doesn't work here and it doesn't work in real life. <br />
<br />
be gone maggot you sicken me. go play LoL nub<br />
<br />
Also SIR, please think before you speak. You don't even know how dumb you sound. If you want to complain about shit being dumb go post on the blizz forums where you can properly get trolled instead of my tired half ass attempt to flame you for being the lazy douche that you explain to us to be.</div></div><hr />

The new quest zone was a joke; I saw the rewards, I saw how little they value their casual players. &quot;Just give em recolored rares, they'll eat it up. toss in a recolored mount too for kicks&quot; No thank you blizzard, my money will go elsewhere.

What a pathetically stupid remark. <br />
I quit the game because I don't have time to play, but I'm still interested in it. I follow the game news, patches, I watch boss movies etc. I have every right to have an opinion, as does MrShapatsky, whose comment you ridiculed.<br />
Can you get such a concept through your brain?<br />
<br />
On another note. People need to understand that a casual player is in majority in WoW. It's those casuals who generate the most subscriptions. <br />
Let's take a look at wowprogress.com. They list about 25,000 guilds that killed normal Shannox. Assuming that guilds that register on that site care about progress, let's call them, for the sake of this post, &quot;hardcore raiders&quot;. There are 10 and 25 man guilds, so let's assume 30 raiders per guild. 30 times 25,000 equals 750,000. So, roughly 10,000,000 people aren't raiders. They generate a vast majority of income for Blizzard. It's perfectly obvious that Blizzard has to cater to them first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe they enjoyed the game at one point and are hoping it will bring back that same nostalgic feeling they get when recalling past world pvp events, server first ragnaros kills (the first time around), the release of maraudon etc...<br />
<br />
You could argue that people who play the game have nothing else to do with their pathetic lives but play video games all day. But you'd be wrong.<br />
<br />
Why do you feel you have insight into other people's minds as to their reasoning for sticking around?<br />
<br />
I was in beta, I still play every single expansion and the only major raids I missed first time around was 2 wings of naxx in vanilla, sunwell in TBC, the LK fight in wrath and firelands in current content.<br />
<br />
The problem for me is that it gets stale very quickly after release. I think myself and my entire guild lasted about 3 months into cataclysm before leaving. I, personally, am still around because I enjoy playing video games, and WoW among very few is one of the games still around after 6/7 years. I'm just keeping an eye on things to see if there's anything that interests me and if there's anything enticing enough to make me re-subscribe.</div></div><hr />

WRONG!!! It is not Blizzards job to do anything except provide the game they want. If you like what they are making, then play it. If not, get the fuck out. You're seriously whining about not getting &quot;cool looking&quot; gear from dungeons. Seriously? Here's the deal.....if you want &quot;cool, matching gear&quot; get the fuck into a raid and get it. Oh well you don't like raiding. I don't like pvp, but if I want the gear guess what I do.....I do PVP to get it. Quit bitching about not getting exactly what you want and play the damn game that's given to you.....or not. If not, you will not be missed, I assure you.</div></div><hr />

I want to play WoW, but not in an environment where I have no hope for obtaining an armor set unless I'm a hardcore raider.<br />
<br />
You can get 3 pieces of tier and 4 other epics with out stepping into a raid now (Not to mention craftables), sorry you have to work for something this is a game you know you don't pay 15 dollars for blizzard to hand you stuff neither does any other mmo.<br />
What's the point of having raid gear if you don't raid? You don't need anywhere near full 378 for 5 mans of any type.<br />
<br />
Also you don't have to raid 7 nights a week to get gear most in my guild raid 2 nights a week and are very well geared, just cause your &quot;Casual&quot; doesn't mean you cant raid.<br />
Sounds like your lazy to me and you want blizzard to hand you everything without any work on your side.<br />
<br />
They give us hand me down raider gear with half the set locked away behind raid end bosses. <br />
<br />
That &quot;Hand me down raid set&quot; is supposed to get you into raiding not make you look pretty while you sit in ORG/SW<br />
<br />
Bottom line is you get the gear based on the amount of effort you put into the game if you only want to play say 5 hours a week then you'll get a amount/quality of gear based on that, if you wanna raid 5 nights a week you'll get gear based on that effort.<br />
The more effort you put into a game the more rewarded you are that's a rule for any game, not just a blizzard product.<br />
Blizzard messed up one tier i wrath, if you look back previous tiers you'll know that they did the same thing there doing now hell even in tier 9 (ToC) you needed trophy's from raids to get certain pieces of your set.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
um I think that was kind of rude .Some people leave because they lost a job and cant afford it and others left because they are moving on and others are fed up with the game because it the same thing over.This game been out for more than 5 years and people that play it since the beginning are probably saying nothing really is changing it the same grind over and over and etc.Although some thing have been very good some people don't like the recycle boss like rags in firelands or the revamp of za and zg because it being recycle and blizzard not coming out with newer stuff instead they rehashing old lore and bring old lore back and trying to make it current lore and saying this is why he back etc.</div></div><hr />

But we can assume that if 900k people were paying 15 bucks a month then Blizz gets $13.500.000 less each month. And that sure as hell is noticeable considering they really can't make any cuts or anything now (closing up realms would be just giving up). <br />
<br />
On topic of &quot;the biggest content update&quot; - I wouldn't get too aroused by this, IMO it just means content similiar 4.1 + 4.2 but it will come out together. So easily raid with 7 bosses and 2 revamped dungeons and yay, there is your biggest content update... And later this year could very well be late autumn or xmas... Kinda sad, ain't it? <br />
<br />
And don't say the game is old. It was old couple months before releasing Cata too and yet people were still here. Community got used to easy raids and 5mans, nonraiders suddenly became raiders and people could easily pug and raid on their gazilion alts etc. And Blizz took that away, even made it so 10&amp;25 share the same lockout so people now leave. I don't comment on it, just stating facts.</div></div><hr />

Well, it's their fault the game cannot be updated every month. That's all. They do content which is done by the end of the week, so easily that many people doesn't have for doing later. In the earlier days of WoW, aside from having 5 dungeons, you had lots of stuff out there keeping you on the move. Reputations, world drops, farming mats, finding new rare recipes, long quest chains.This is all Blizzard fault, they're killing themselves by doing leveling so fast like a fart, quests shorter and so described using the tools that no one has even have to think what to do, there's also reputations that doesn't offer anything more worth than T1 content and raising to Exalted is now kids game.What do you want from a game who ripped out all the character progression to the point of an arcade game?Tell me.</div></div><hr />

WoW just lost it's class a bit since WotLK. No, to be honest, ever since the end of BC.<br />
<br />
Blizzard states that it's the players that are better than ever because we know the game better, but what about the hundreds of implementations and nerfs that made the content itself so easy? So overwhelmingly boring? What about the interface possibilities that we have today? What about the homogenization that rules the classes these days?<br />
<br />
I'm not wearing any pink glasses or anything, I just remember that WoW had it's most exciting time back in the day. When you were okay with the fact that you own some good blue gear (which was the majority of gear available) and only the real freaks who spent hours each day would have some epics at least, even if they were just the upgraded blues. No matter if groups had to be found in cities for hours, or if you had to manually search for a tank - it made the server feel like a community. You looked up to guilds or looked up to players with way cooler gear than you had, EVEN THOUGH he only had his dungeon set completed and managed to exchange some pieces to it's epic upgrades via the long long quests.<br />
<br />
We don't have restrictions anymore. Restrictions based on distance to an instance, restrictions based on time to spend for an instance for a full run. We don't have a real server community anymore, because you don't even have to care about anyone else. All you do is log in, queue for an instance or BG and let it pop. Join, quickly rush through, don't even share a single word or sentence, get the piece you want and leave again, to find yourself in a city that is so crowded, yet so empty.<br />
<br />
What happened to the people that duelled in front of Orgrimmar? What happened to the never ending crowd in Ironforge? What happened to the feeling of adventure when you headed into an instance? What happened to bosses like Archaedes, where your group disbanded in joy because he was just too hard? You still felt that you achieved something.<br />
<br />
What happened?<br />
<br />
I know, it's normal, and I'm forgetting a lot of the bad things back then. But let's be honest - this doesn't excludes the fact that the game lost a big big part of it's overwhelming size.</div></div><hr />

A random BWD pug now and again, but mostly its ICC and Ulduar.<br />

That said, cataclysm was suppose to bring back a burning crusade / vanilla feel to the game. By the looks of it, the game is easing back into Burning crusade / pre-early wotlk levels.<br />
<br />
You know why it peaked? Cause they released in china not because the US got more subs or because it was a good expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I used to love the game and played it from beta up to wotlk. News about the game still has a news value to me and that is not strange at all. People read news everyday, lots of news every day, that they have not the slightest thing to do with, it's happening right now, everywhere. If anyone asks me what the greatest game i played is i would say World of WarCraft without a hesitation. <br />
<br />
Blizzard gave us a game and the players created a life style. But right now, they are on the 7th year(?) of doing the same thing over and over again. History repeats itself. It's new content, new 5 mans, new raids, number tweaks, new cosmetics but under the hood stuff hasn't really changed at all. I would say that after they implemented arenas i TBC, nothing new and innovative has been added to the game. The game needs a new and exciting game mechanic that kinda gets the same recognition as raids, bgs, arenas. If you really look at all the content that has been added over the years, so much of it is just new cosmetics and number tweaks and it's fucking dumb. And i choosed to comment it, because i feel like to few really questions what's really going on in the game. People say they want harder content or easier content, is that what the game is about? Numbers and different numbers? The community should ask for more game mechanics, innovative stuff. Don't buy the cheap stuff Blizzard sells, after all you are paying a lot of resources into the game, time and money.<br />
<br />
I see a lot of comments also about people only playing because of the friends they have, you know what, if you need the game to glue your friendship together how good of friends are you really then? I'm still in contact with a lot of friends i gained from WoW but i also realized that some of the players i thought i was friends with was nothing but dead weight.<br />
<br />
TL;DR version:<br />
Be smart</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LolToon</div><div class="date">2011-08-04, 07:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh and me having a near full heroic t11 set makes me a hardcore raider? Not really. Oh and why the need for the best raid gear obtainable if all it's used for is doing 5 mans?<br />
<br />
In WotLK it took until nearly the end of the game, but I was finally able to get gear that I was denied for not being in a big guild OR being shunned from pugs because I didn't have the LOLACHIEVES or I was unfortunately the wrong class/spec choice at the time and would refuse to change just because idiots didn't understand I knew how to play my class and or spec.<br />
<br />
So being able to slowly grind heroics for my gear, made my day. Somewhat.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh sure people whine that heroics were to easy, but really, I didn't queue up for a heroic to spend 3 hours in a wipe fest, with undergeared healers or tanks or dps in dps kit thinking they could tank... I spent my money for something to kill time while my friends are offline.<br />
<br />
But now? As one of those people who left and you were chortling about?<br />
<br />
Well lets see; Dungeons are a pain in the ass to pug. Even the satchel doesn't offer much reward incentive for me. I received so much abuse on my healers I stopped healing pugs and turned to PVP. Where abuse was less actually than pugs and omgasp, actually reportable!<br />
<br />
On my DPS, I got tired of not being healed by lazy healers who didn't understand the concept that if you have nearly full mana bar, and dps takes unavoidable damage, please use something cheap and easy to keep my ass from scrubbing the ground.<br />
<br />
And my tanks OH LORD NO.My DK and my Pally and my War are now HIDING THAT SPEC. FOREVER.<br />
<br />
So that scratches dungeons, raiding and etc from my game time! What's left!<br />
<br />
Dailies and PVP! Dailies. Yeah.<br />
<br />
I did Dailies for TBC. So fun.<br />
<br />
I did Dailies for WotLK. So. Much. Fun.<br />
<br />
Blizz: Hey we're gonna design some poorly thought out dailies that will glitch and crash and not work properly, for all you casuals. And for all those with hunters, we threw in pets that will be continually raped/ganked while you tame them, whoo hoo!<br />
<br />
So needless to say I was less than thrilled, so I turned exclusively to pvp. And even then? It's not fun. No it really isn't. I want to do more than log on, spend an hour killing people on my hunters or out healing people on my druid as they rage face and nerd rage over how they can't kill me. WoW is hardly fun anymore.<br />
<br />
Oh and RealID LFD. Paying for two features that are free otherwise? Yeah. No. Fuck that, fuck the premium.<br />
<br />
Oh, but wait, you know what really drove me off finally?<br />
<br />
The stupid. Retarded. PoS GM's I kept getting recently. Either not being able to speak english when it is clearly what I write fluently and only in. Not being able to grasp the concept of I could mean something entirely different so shut the fuck up about whining about people who were being abused by past LFD kicking systems or how I am basically told that I can be sexually harassed, insulted, attacked, griefed and otherwise verbally abused in pugs, from a blue, because LOL L2IGNORE and L2DROP GROUP.<br />
<br />
Yeah that's a real reason to continue playing wow, isn't it?</div></div><hr />

Fact of the matter is this patch provided raid content unprecedented in how good it was. It brought back the WotLK PuG model so that people could see the content. Mediocre guilds could progress and kill Ragnaros and start working on heroic modes. The hardcores should be happier than they've ever been before. The last three heroic mode fights are absolutely amazing and to see how much effort is going into heroic ragnaros should just show how successful it was. The problem is not casual vs. hardcore bullshit. The problem is that the majority of the playerbase plays for quick action. This includes random bg's and heroics. Make changes to those two and we'll see the game be far more successful than ever before. Or so I believe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the mantra here to a vast majority of veterans leaving, not minor number discrepancies, not it being to hard or easy, not about obtain loot.<br />
<br />
Its they need to do something new, they need more things to do. Stop with the generic raids and 5 mans, what is topping them from making a dungeon to whatever number they would enjoy or fit a place best? They could add in a lot of different things like group size changes, PvP changes, that are totally unrelated with class or balance, just purely content.<br />
<br />
Blizzard lacks so freaking heavily in innovative content,they NEED to innovate, not respond, reply and elaborate with the stupid fools QQing about why their class can't be the most OP one and arguing other balance issues with total idiots on the forums. What they need to do is take time to review NEW ideas for the game, ones well laid out that have merit and not somebody's shitty class ideas, or some new way to role play, or singular ability for one's class, people aren't interested in that crap. They want the game they have played for a long time to be DYNAMIC.<br />
<br />
The &quot;trinity&quot; system for one needs to be looked at heavily and the way threat and AI works I would think, at least for some content in game. They AI in this game is just so simple to deal with, to an experienced gamer and player of MMOs everything pretty much feels like a tank and spank if the boss targets only one or two people over 90% of the fight.</div></div><hr />

I don't want it fast - i want it eventually. I just need a carrot on that stick that I know i can eventually reach. Right now, blizzard is adamant against providing me my carrot. See, it isn't about what you &quot;think&quot; people should have to do to earn armor. If I can't get a complete set of armor from running dungeons, my preferred gameplay, then I WILL NOT PAY BLIZZARD. That means less subscription money, and that speaks louder than your &quot;B-B-BUT MY EPICS ARE SUPPOSEDTA BE SPECIAL&quot;You want your carrot? Go run low level dungeons and raids.

As sick and twisted as that sounds, maybe blizzard will wake the fuck up and make tier accessible to non-raiders like it was in WotLK. Or at least give casuals something to do with rewards that aren't recolored rehashed shit, while raiders get all the new shinies. The new quest zone was a joke; I saw the rewards, I saw how little they value their casual players. &quot;Just give em recolored rares, they'll eat it up. toss in a recolored mount too for kicks&quot; No thank you blizzard, my money will go elsewhere. Make your game casual friendly like it was in WotLK and we'll talk about me re-subbing. If it takes another 1,100,000 people to leave to make a round two million, I hope blizzard it will get blizzard to fix their shit. I want to play WoW, but not in an environment where I have no hope for obtaining an armor set unless I'm a hardcore raider.<br />
<br />
All the lost subs over the past 2 quarters are all the Wrath babies, like you, who just quit when the shit wasn't as 'casual' as it was a year ago. In case you people have all forgotten World of Warcraft is an MMORPG. The core of an MMO is that it's made for hardcore players. If you want casual, play your fucking XBOX. I don't raid because I have a wife and child and work 60 hours a week. Am I going to bitch and moan because I can't obtain the best gear in the game because of my lack of free time?? FUCK NO!! I hope Blizz continues to lose subs. Not because they'll lose money but maybe so some of the QQ'ing little bitches will gtfo of my game. Btw, I played WoW at the E3 Blizz booth in 2003 and have been playing since release. I've played through all of this game's changes. And I'm not going anywhere. If you don't like the direction they have taken this game... Stop playing, get the fuck off our forums, and for the love of god stop complaining.</div></div><hr />

Myself being from the upper tier of humanity (based on income and IQ) i just have to assume that it is the smart ones who are leaving first.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
TL;DR version:<br />
Be smart <br />

It's like you're a different person and I completely misunderstood your first post. It's NOT you acting superior or arrogant towards people who still play, no sir, its hard hitting, critical analysis.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On another note, us players won't even notice the difference in player base, I doubt Blizz will either.<br />
<br />
Compare a medium pop wow server to a high pop rift server. Hell, I think even a low pop wow server is busier than a high pop rift server.<br />
<br />
The only time I notice a difference when people quit, is when a good friend leaves who is a good player and that has been happening since vanilla times.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jayremy</div><div class="date">2011-08-04, 08:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just thought I would let you know that although it's not a true set with bonuses. The troll dugeon gear all matches and looks like a complete set.<br />
<br />
<br />
OT: I think people are leaving now because leveling is so much easier. A lot more people have max levels of every class where as before, in Vanilla mostly but BC as well, it took a long time to max out a character. When some one got tired of their class they could re-roll. This could take months to max your character. Now, you can get BOA's and hit 85 in a solid 2 weeks from scratch. This meens people get board of that character faster. It gets to the point where you have made enough alts that you just get burnt out and don't have anything else to do. Wow world is getting smaller and smaller. Old content, outlands, northrend are dead areas with very few players and the new content is just so fast. It takes more or less 1-2 days to go from 80-85. They need to make leveling slower. More content. Better mixture of raids / dungeons.<br />
<br />
Not true, Leveling felt slow and boring at 80-84, it felt the same, same as the last couple x-pacs. I quit in the middle, I don't like my warrior as a main, they have boring utility, no fun tools or anything (may be effective) but its dull as fuck, especially being the most vulnerable melee dps class(particularly in PvE), I try leveling other toon and it literally bores me to sleep in less than an hour or 2, I prefer not having to level again if is going to be such easy garbage crap that takes days to do or heirloom farming.<br />
<br />
They gameplay itself though is stale, even at 85, I can no longer stand, the rotation mashing mentality, DPS is more like a mathematical equation and tanking is so stupid, id rather avoid damage not run up and get hit. At least I didn't have to worry about threat in WotLK and just mitigating damage best i could and beating up the boss and good positioning.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bahska</div><div class="date">2011-08-04, 08:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In WotLK it took until nearly the end of the game, but I was finally able to get gear that I was denied for not being in a big guild OR being shunned from pugs because I didn't have the LOLACHIEVES or I was unfortunately the wrong class/spec choice at the time and would refuse to change just because idiots didn't understand I knew how to play my class and or spec.<br />
<br />
So being able to slowly grind heroics for my gear, made my day. Somewhat.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh sure people whine that heroics were to easy, but really, I didn't queue up for a heroic to spend 3 hours in a wipe fest, with undergeared healers or tanks or dps in dps kit thinking they could tank... I spent my money for something to kill time while my friends are offline.<br />
<br />
But now? As one of those people who left and you were chortling about?<br />
<br />
Well lets see; Dungeons are a pain in the ass to pug. Even the satchel doesn't offer much reward incentive for me. I received so much abuse on my healers I stopped healing pugs and turned to PVP. Where abuse was less actually than pugs and omgasp, actually reportable!<br />
<br />
On my DPS, I got tired of not being healed by lazy healers who didn't understand the concept that if you have nearly full mana bar, and dps takes unavoidable damage, please use something cheap and easy to keep my ass from scrubbing the ground.<br />
<br />
And my tanks OH LORD NO.My DK and my Pally and my War are now HIDING THAT SPEC. FOREVER.<br />
<br />
So that scratches dungeons, raiding and etc from my game time! What's left!<br />
<br />
Dailies and PVP! Dailies. Yeah.<br />
<br />
I did Dailies for TBC. So fun.<br />
<br />
I did Dailies for WotLK. So. Much. Fun.<br />
<br />
Blizz: Hey we're gonna design some poorly thought out dailies that will glitch and crash and not work properly, for all you casuals. And for all those with hunters, we threw in pets that will be continually raped/ganked while you tame them, whoo hoo!<br />
<br />
So needless to say I was less than thrilled, so I turned exclusively to pvp. And even then? It's not fun. No it really isn't. I want to do more than log on, spend an hour killing people on my hunters or out healing people on my druid as they rage face and nerd rage over how they can't kill me. WoW is hardly fun anymore.<br />
<br />
Oh and RealID LFD. Paying for two features that are free otherwise? Yeah. No. Fuck that, fuck the premium.<br />
<br />
Oh, but wait, you know what really drove me off finally?<br />
<br />
The stupid. Retarded. PoS GM's I kept getting recently. Either not being able to speak english when it is clearly what I write fluently and only in. Not being able to grasp the concept of I could mean something entirely different so shut the fuck up about whining about people who were being abused by past LFD kicking systems or how I am basically told that I can be sexually harassed, insulted, attacked, griefed and otherwise verbally abused in pugs, from a blue, because LOL L2IGNORE and L2DROP GROUP.<br />
<br />
Yeah that's a real reason to continue playing wow, isn't it?<br />
<br />
You do know they nerfed almost all the heroics to the ground right? There not even a challenge anymore, ZA and ZG were hard for the first few weeks. There's always gonna be a bad pug that's what the kick feature is for if its really bad you leave and re queue.<br />
I did all my daily's yesterday, all except one being ZA/ZG and i had 1 bad group (I was close to my resto druids tier gloves, big upgrade)<br />
<br />
I can be sexually harassed, insulted, attacked, griefed and otherwise verbally abused in pugs, from a blue<br />
<br />
I highly doubt that actually happened but did you ticket a GM or just go on the forums, cause there's a right way to report that sort of behavior and a wrong way.<br />
Normally if any of that stuff happens people are suspended or even banned for multiple offenses.<br />
A blue wont tell you you can do any of that, though a blue will tell you to report it in game instead of on the forums. Not there fault if you cant type a few sentences or learn how to open a ticket, if it's urgent GM's will act fast pay no attention to the 2 day wait time. I opened a ticket twice to get my toon unstuck during the buggy patch 4.0 and they were responded to within minutes.<br />
<br />
So needless to say I was less than thrilled, so I turned exclusively to pvp. And even then? It's not fun. No it really isn't.

It really hasnt lost that much quality, but the reason isnt because so many people are unsubscribing, people have been doing that since the dawn of the world... of warcraft, but because they arent getting new subscribers. You guys may laugh and think its nothing, but i have not seen a wow commercial since the cata trailer, which isnt as appealing. The ozzy osbourne and mr.t comercial and wow being on a then new south park episode really brought in a lot of customers despite how much you may dismiss the idea of ozzy and cartman bringing in customers. There's also the matter of the start up cost of playing, which is crazy high for a video game right now, it cost $20 for reg wow and bc, $40 for wrath, and $40 for cata. That's $100 dollars just to play the relevant content, with of course having to pay another $15 a month. The other big reason is because a lot of long time subscribers are bored playing the same game for 7 odd years now, and i don't blame them. They might say its cause wow is now too easy, and they cater to casuals too much, but wow isnt that much easier then before. It's because they are better at the game. If you play the same game for multiple years 2 things are going to happen: 1. You're gonna get better at the game, thus making things that seemed hard when you started playing easy to you now. and 2. You're going to get bored of it. 90% of players cant play the same game multiple years straight without getting more and more bored over time.</div></div><hr />

Nerfed raids, dungeon content can only go so far and it doesnt apply to everyone.<br />
<br />
I mean, who the heck would pay 15 dollars month to DO DAILIES everyday? Achievements and alts can only go so far. <br />
If I didnt have awesome guild and werent raiding I would've quit year ago due lack of end-game content. <br />
There are people who doesnt raid or cant do dungeons for either time restrictions or just not bothering (Farm month T12 gear to..run zul'again/normal heroics? lol?)<br />
<br />
Making alt is answer, sure but what they are gonna do then? More dailies with dozens of alts and main? Not fun.<br />
<br />
Casuals are the ones that bring money to table so they can do raids/dungeons, whether you like it or not. &quot;hardcores&quot; however are loyal customers who are subbed for long time and consume all content. Casuals are masses but sub and unsub randomly, by giving them goals and stuff to do they will keep them subbed for longer. Making daily hub that takes months (or longer for them due time restrictions) is not really keeping them subbed till next patch..<br />

That my friends, Aint nothing.For me, I see even more people then before. Small realms migth be boring, yes, and that will make some quit. But if you play on a crowded realm, you might not even noticed the loss of players.There is like.....200 realms or smt? That would be 1500x accounts not unsubscribed on each realm in general.You need to look at the big picure. BetweenCataclysm and 4.1, WoW lost 600K subs. Between 4.1 and 4.2, they lost another 300K. That means 900,000 subs have gone *poof* since Cataclysm. Are you honestly telling me that almost a million subs is &quot;nothing?&quot;<br />
<br />
As a raider, we had to wait seven and a half months for raid content. After months of nothing to do, I quit. When Firelands came out, I was on holiday, so was going to see how firelands panned out while I was away. My guild cleared normals in the first 2 weeks, and that was enough for me to NOT resubscribe.</div></div><hr />

Basically, WoW's decline can be placed into three categories: <br />
<br />
1) Personal achievements players used to work towards can now either be completed within a few weeks (lol heirlooms) , or such accomplishments can be completely negated by the next major content patch. (so i herd u leik nerfed content) <br />

2) No incentive for servers to build their own communities anymore thanks to cross-server BGs/dungeon finder/realID dungeon finder. In result, players generally do not invest in enriching their server community, and it becomes no different from the other 240 servers that exist. (Though there are some exceptions to the rule) <br />
<br />
3) Nothing new to look forward to. Much of the content this expansion is old stuff that has been given a fresh coat of paint and some polish. While I appreciate Blizzard updating the old world and its lore, I was less than impressed with the re-release of the troll dungeons. Not that I was impressed with them re-releasing Naxx in WotLK. People want new things. We like exploration. We like the unknown. We don't want re-releases of old content.<br />
<br />
And while we're on the subject of stuff that shouldn't be done, do not want another ToGC. Don't ever do that again.</div></div><hr />

It's nothing for you, but for Blizzard 900k out of 13M is something like 7% less players in 6 months.<br />

<br />
Also, lets just sweep under the rug that all that armor is identical to the level 70 raid version. It's not a new armor set, its old models with inferior numbers slapped on it.<br />
<br />
Why would you be gimping yourself?? If you don´t raid at all, why do you need 359 ilvl gear. Are you just bad and want to faceroll/mass AOE dungeons down in 10 min like the end of wotlk? It just seems you are whining because you don´t want to do the work required to get the gear you want. In BC tier sets were all tokens and not farmable like they are now. Raiding gear requires you to raid, do the work or stop whining if you don´t want to do it.<br />

Its not about the e-peen its about the sense of competition. <br />

If anything i think the people who cry about stuff being to easy cause they see pro's beat it in a week or two, when they are only 2/7 normal (If that) hurt the game a lot more.</div></div><hr />

Yes i know that it was, but was it like these days? that a whole expansion gets cleared in 1 week or 2? ofc it wasn't, stuff was hard back then, and now its easy, ,at my point of veiew firelands has the most obvious and comon sence mechanic boss fights ever, even ragnaros hc is piss easy, &quot;omg sulfuron smash,, move 2 yards to the sides, OMG ADDS...

Im glad your guild has downed heroic rag! Oh wait, no you have not. LOL<br />
<br />
Also world firsts were the same since Vanilla. Yes as much as it is these days. Only thing is that there are a few more guilds capable to compete in the top tier (raid more etc, not saying they are way more skilled in any way)<br />
<br />
Please stop talking rubbish. Atleast bring up valid points. The simple fact to why blizzard is losing subs is because the game is OLD and people are getting tired of repetitive content.<br />
<br />
If you think about it, when blizzard released Sunwell and the Isle of quel. Everyone was on the island for majority of their gametime either doing dailies or for world pvp. Atleast on my realm everyone was having fun there. This time blizzard releases firelands and the molten front. Everyone acts like pve carebears and hardly any world pvp. Then they complain why no world pvp etc. Fact is after the vendors are unlocked there is absolutely no reason to do the dailies. Dailies in TBC were a pretty good money maker. Now its slower than sitting in org and crafting reselling. They need to make dailies more rewarding to get people outside of their home towns. They need to readd world bosses. Sure its unfair but it brought excitement to the world. People would camp, fight for it and sometimes at 3AM you would see LFM kazzak etc simply cause its up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I Guess dieing 500+ times to one boss means the fight is easy. <br />
Even the best guild in the world was quoted in saying this was the hardest fight they have seen in years.<br />
<br />
Please don't think a fight is easy based on pro's, now if the average person went in and 1 shot Rag Heroic then i would agree but that isn't happening. <br />
Your looking at the best guild's in the world ones that get payed to play and may play 15+ hours a day in the first few weeks of a patch, and taking that is everyone is clearing the content in 2 weeks.<br />
Im sorry but your wrong your higher than average guild may have cleared normals in a week but they were probably decked out in full heroic tier 11 gear, they weren't meant to spend weeks upon weeks in normals and burn out.<br />
That design was even on the PTR but it was seen as OMGEASYCONTENT, no it was meant to get the heroic guilds in heroics faster if they went through the effort in the previous tier heavily gearing. <br />
If you only went through normal's in tier 11 then your raids are normals otherwise by design you were rushed to heroics, to combat against burn out.<br />
There's gonna be people who rush to complete stuff first in any game that's what competition is, competition isn't a bad thing for any game and will always be there no matter what.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry to burst your bubble, dude, but T11 is as easy as MC Naxxramas was back in the 80s.<br />
<br />
Ulduar and ICC (with buff) were way WAY harder that T11 right now.So move your butt and go in there. <br />

Don't expect them to release Firelands on that niveau and to be able to just skip T11. <br />

Its so easy nowadays. Bring back the epic feeling! Add world pvp dailies! Raid X town and kill X leader. Perhaps a board so the opposite faction know which of their leaders is for bounty and they can defend. Also this can apply to non capital cities to not cause major lag. Add reputation vendors for each of the new bgs. Make fresh content! Stop redoing and reintroducing old content. Doesnt matter if they have different abilities. People like seeing new names and a different environment.Also include tax ingame. There is way too much gold in the game atm and not enough gold sinks. I myself am at 500k+ after buying every gold sink and all new boe epics my character can use from firelands. Perhaps put a tax weekly so you loose gold and not just sit on it and keep building up. Or include more GOLD SINKS. This is cataclysm. 100k isnt hard to make honestly. I dont get how the mammoth was 16k in Wotlk and now most vendor mounts are 2-3k? (Guild vendor mounts, rep mounts etc) Make professions have bop mats that are hard to get for good items. Make people work to collect items and then the item is more rewarding. Perhaps including mats from bosses so some items remain rare! Stop catering everything to casuals. Blizzard went wrong after they changed the whole game into casual mode. Look at TBC. It was the perfect mix. Everybody loves TBC the most because it was balanced for both casuals and hardcore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't see one as easy mode, let do I see the non-heroic being there to appease bad players. What I do see is many water cooler hardcores who boast on message boards either directly or indirectly how great they are but I never seem to connect those people to the 7/7 heroic guilds. Go figure.<br />
<br />
Heroic modes exist simply because some groups are in another league from the vast majority of wow players. I figure its probably less than 2% of the player base who can hit these up when they are released and complete them. There are many who can't even complete them when the next iLevel drops because even gear cannot compensate for execution issues.</div></div><hr />

Journalism and media and communication are two major scientific fields that studys everything around news, communication, public communication including news values and why people are interested in news and such. If you are interested in more info about all this, there are probably courses you take at your closest University or just visit an academic library and ask for a book about news, journalism or something like that.<br />

That sub money can go to another game like League of Legends or something else. I'll say it again, clearer this time: I will not be forced by a GAME that required a MONTHLY FEE to do something I DO NOT FIND FUN to enjoy said game. Its a waste of money. And its funny, because you can argue your &quot;tier should be raiders only derp derp&quot; point on the forums all you want. I've spoken with my wallet. So have nearly a million others. Guess what blizzard is going to listen to? I'll give you a hint: It isn't the people on the forums, its the people who stopped paying. &quot;YOU SHOULD HAVE TO WORK FOR IT YOU ENTITLED BLAH BLAH BLAH RAGE&quot; Yes. I should. I had to work for my tier 9/10 in WotLK. It took me three months of grinding heroics to finish my sets. That's work. Sorry if you don't agree, but it is. That system worked, that system kept me playing. I do not give two fucks if you think I'm acting entitled. I'm a paying customer. Blizzard can either cater to me, and get my subscription fee, or they can ignore me, and i'll spend my money elsewhere. And no, this HAS worked in the past, it was called WotLK. I subbed through most of WotLK from the end of ulduar on. The system for tier worked from ToC onward - I had a gear set to obtain. I had a goal I could reach. This continued through ICC. If you wanted your vanity gear, you got it doing 25m raids, getting tokens, and what not.</div></div><hr />

There's many, many slots left to fill that don't involve tier; also, as anyone will tell you, a tier set piece is slightly worse than a similar item of that ilevel, since the set bonus is incorporated into its stat weight. So someone wearing 5 pieces of tier from a dungeon would be better off with at least one of them being swapped out for a raid drop.<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, I don't need 'the best raid gear' - I never said &quot;HEROIC RAID TIER&quot;. I said Tier Set. that's it.<br />
<br />
And why? Because it's my goal in the game to collect an armor set. Humor me, what set is there for a casual to complete? You say tier 11? I tell you NOPE, blizzard left the token requirements on, aka Nef or cho. I do not raid; I do not enjoy raids. in WotLK, I could, slowly but surely, obtain the tier set over a long period of time. by the time I was celebrating my last tier piece, the raiders were halfway through heroic modes and had not only better loot in EVERY OTHER SLOT, but they had the same tier suit I did, with some pieces heroic level. <br />
<br />
That was what I played for. Each expansion, I looked forward to collecting my tier set. That was what motivated me to play. Locking two pieces? the ONLY TWO PIECES with unique polygons? Yeah, blizz can go fuck off until they fix this. If you want your unique raid loot, go get your Sulfuras, the extinguished hand, or some other awesome drop loot. If you want me to pay for your raids each expansion (admit it, raids get the most budget put into them) then you've got to give me something to work for. <br />
<br />
And &quot;why get better gear&quot; WHY PLAY? Wow is an RPG at heart - the game is all about increasing numbers to increase performance so you can increase other numbers. The game only gets easier with better loot. But more to the point; please direct me to the DUNGEON SET I can collect as a dungeon grinder?<br />
<br />
WHATS THAT? THERE ISN'T A DUNGEON SET? Gee imagine that. They could put in a dungeon set for people like me to work for. instead they give us hand me down raider gear with half the set locked away behind raid end bosses.<br />
<br />
First time I've seen someone else post this arguement - and I'm in total agreement with every word. I'm sick of getting overlooked at each 'expansion'. I pay the same dam fee as everyone else, but my money is going towards enhancing someone else's demands. Don't expect it to change anytime soon - roll on Old Republic.</div></div><hr />

Often I'm tempted to resub, having those beautiful images in my head with my character happilly killing monsters, showing off my skills to my friends in dungeons, practicing to become strong, etc etc... but then I remember what it is really like: sickening repeating dailies, retarded community that takes the fun out of anything done in groups, endless grinding.... and most of all, no ingame clue/help/tutorial/tool whatsoever about what you would actually need to do to practice your skills. <br />
<br />
I play games to relax, I'm not against making efforts to practice and get better, but it needs to be the right kind of effort. That is knowing what to do to become better with a game that gives you the tools to do so, and not having to browse countless website, finding excel sheets, strats, cookie cutter builds etc for hours before starting to have an idea about what to do. That's not only a problem for noobs, but everytime you're off for a few week or after a rebalance patch.</div></div><hr />

I'll say it again, clearer this time: I will not be forced by a GAME that required a MONTHLY FEE to do something I DO NOT FIND FUN to enjoy said game. Its a waste of money. And its funny, because you can argue your &quot;tier should be raiders only derp derp&quot; point on the forums all you want. I've spoken with my wallet. So have nearly a million others. Guess what blizzard is going to listen to? I'll give you a hint: It isn't the people on the forums, its the people who stopped paying. &quot;YOU SHOULD HAVE TO WORK FOR IT YOU ENTITLED BLAH BLAH BLAH RAGE&quot; Yes. I should. I had to work for my tier 9/10 in WotLK. It took me three months of grinding heroics to finish my sets. That's work. Sorry if you don't agree, but it is. That system worked, that system kept me playing. I do not give two fucks if you think I'm acting entitled. I'm a paying customer. Blizzard can either cater to me, and get my subscription fee, or they can ignore me, and i'll spend my money elsewhere. And no, this HAS worked in the past, it was called WotLK. I subbed through most of WotLK from the end of ulduar on. The system for tier worked from ToC onward - I had a gear set to obtain. I had a goal I could reach. This continued through ICC. If you wanted your vanity gear, you got it doing 25m raids, getting tokens, and what not.<br />

May the door hit you on the way out. Believe it or not, your $15 isn't more important than anyone else's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am with the crowd of people who are against a lot of WotLK (except for uld era) and Cata. Not for nostalgic reasons either I can explain many ways that have nothing to do with nostalgia. I am glad to see the drop in subs, it usually means a message, cause most people don't quit WoW because of its 50 cents a day cost, people leave it on because it really is such a measly amount for entertainment you electricity bill to run your comp, play games, and normal routines around gaming and play the game month to month is probably higher, than the sub (at the very least close).<br />
<br />
<br />
But I find this very snobby, IQ, saying you got a high IQ I wouldn't mind so much, but bringing income into it....<br />
<br />
Well lets just say this, there are a lot of dumbasses with high income, its called luck... or fortune. Plenty of educated, smart people who aren't making in shitloads of money, being smart or even wise doesn't help, its a combination of luck and highly prioritizing being a rich snobby dude. Many people may want money but not a good amount.<br />
<br />
Also IQ ain't shit if you can never put it to good use, a dumb philosopher is better for the world than a smart, fool.</div></div><hr />

I don't know much about PvP these days, but all I've been hearing recently is that Firelands normal modes are too easy. Pretty much anyone can faceroll their way through all of T11 and the first FL bosses right now. T11 was a bit tough at the onset but after the fixes for 10man came in it was no more difficult than Karazhan when it was still current content, perhaps even easier.</div></div><hr />

Show me a single press release in the past where they announced they lost a single player over any term of play until Cataclysm launched. You won't find it, because they never announced it. It's because year to year since 2008 growth was stagnant. They're forecasting losses this year worldwide, just like they've been losing plays in the US/EU since then, only new subs aren't enough to cover the turn over anymore. It isn't the simple causality you view it as.</div></div><hr />

What i dont understand is how can you call a game with 10 million + gamers dead? I mean if you were talking about Guild Wars, AoC or WAR then yeah but WoW?You might want to open a history book if you don't understand the &quot;Rome&quot; Kaeleena is talking about. The problem is people don't or refuse to see the inevitable happening untill the very moment when they find themselves in the ruins of what once was and then the first stages of grief still have to start. Other people see things coming from a distance and are just more sober about the situation. <br />
<br />
The &quot;Rome&quot; Kaeleena was talking about is the Roman empire before our Christian time line. We all know what happened to the Roman empire. The beauty of Kaeleena's example is that it portrais the nature of people. Eventhough the inevitable decline has set in, people just don't want to see it and hide in denial. Even when the party is over they think that somehow it's just begun. All refusing to see that they were wrong. It's so much easier just to be awake, try it.<br />

<br />
I'm a long term player (6 years plus) and have loved playing WoW in that time. I'm not a hard core raider, more of a hard core casual if there is such a thing. From my perspective Wrath was the start of the decline of the game. Wrath was produced to capture the younger player and over simplified some of the mechanics and gear to get the younger player interested and boost subscription numbers. <br />
<br />
Cata was produced to re-invent the early game and graphics engine so WoW could continue to compete with newer MMO for the next couple of years. My issue here is that we have paid for Blizzard to upgrade the game engine with little new content in Cata. The Engine upgrade should have been a patch and Cata should have more new content to justify the original purchase price. <br />
<br />
TBC had no obvious business objective other than to add additional quality end game content and expand the WoW universe. <br />
<br />
The game is suffering from the obvious shift in development priorities within Activision/Blizzard. Look at how item stats have changed. Loss of MP5 , Hunters loosing Int, Spirit on gear, talents that gives spirt hit. This is all there to cut development time as less items now need to be in game to upgrade your Toon. End result cheaper development costs. <br />
<br />
On top of this there are the the high charges for name changes, cross realm transfers etc. Which looks like an automated SQL script to update a database record. I know these premium services are optional but the price charged leaves a bit of bitter taste in the mouth.<br />
<br />
We are still paying premium prices for a game that doesn't deliver as much as it used to for the established player base. People may be realising this now and going elsewhere.<br />
<br />
P.S. Don't get me started on Panda's, Blizzard will be aiming at the 3-6 year old market with this one ! Rattle of Doom here we come.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And if you can't smell the smoldering cinders anymore, it's because you've been inhaling for far too long.<br />
<br />
And this will be confirmed with 4.3 patch notes. They're again making big annoncements, but saying it will be the biggest content patch since Cataclysm isn't saying much. We got what... 2 troll dungeons in 4.1 and a raid along with a modified progression daily grind hub in 4.2. That won't be hard to top so yeah, it'll be the biggest patch in 4.x expansion, but I honestly doubt it will bring anything new to the table. As reported on Gamasutra, it will bring &quot;new raid and new instances&quot;. So it'll be 4.1 + 4.2 combined and we all know how that will go...<br />
<br />
Blizzard had endless amount of good suggestions from players on what else they can offer in WoW. Yes, there are engine limitations, but honestly, there's good stuff we've seen before and never again. So 4.3 will be same old, same old... a couple of 5mans with outdated gear and a new raid that will make everything in 4.2 completely obsolete in 2 weeks. Oh, and maybe some new dailies, so you'll be jumping on that treadmill again. I expect Firelands to be hit with a severe nerfbat, cutting down damage done by 50% and health of bosses by 30% to welcome mouthbreathers who'll then still wipe by falling through holes and herpderping on tornados but... well, 'that's how the cookie crumbles.<br />
<br />
Appearance tab, tabard storage, truly epic questlines (think Benediction or the current legendary, but for non raiders), world PvP, Tol Barad remade into something useful and fun, challenging 5mans, fun achievements (Ready for Raiding II RNG? Bombing elementals RNG? Stab me now!), PvP quests, whatever to break the mold would worth announcing as a big content patch. But with Blizzard's standards today and their continued desire to give us the absolute minimum while developing retarded stuff like paid guild chat through iPhone and Blizz store junk is showing that this old cow isn't only being milked for its last drops, but is being eaten while alive as well.<br />
<br />
Can't wait for 4.3 patch notes. I bet they'll be revolutionary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Very true. But on another hand, I and many others I am sure can't care less about top (payed and sponsored) guilds around the world and actually care about their own guild progression and their server's top guilds. 3 months after Cata started, I would say over 80% of raiding guilds exploded on my servers (4 big / medium servers) and towns like Stormwind or Orgrim became empty. Only the very top guild and a bunch of rerollers / non-raiding guilds are left. So yeah, game is pretty much dead to me, even though I still have best memories from BC raiding.</div></div><hr />
