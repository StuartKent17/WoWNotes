Legion - Rainbow Effect<br />
Recent Legion builds have added rainbow glyphs for mages, such as Glyph of Blinkbow (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/220262-glyph-of-blinkbow) and Glyph of the Falling Rainbow (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/220257-glyph-of-the-falling-rainbow). <br />
<br />
While these aren't fully implemented yet, we decided to take a look at how they might appear. These glyphs aren't actually available yet and the effect is only used for the Prismatic Bauble (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/140309-prismatic-bauble) currently, so this is just an idea of what they might look like if they use the same effect. You can find an alternative version of this preview here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfobcr0-EA4).<br />

Brewmaster Monk Feedback -- Build 21570 -- 27-Apr<br />
I'm going to ignore everyone else in the thread for the moment and point out a problem with Gift of the Ox. <br />
<br />
People are seeing fewer orbs than they should if they use ISB because of the way the proc formula works.<br />
<br />
(0.75 * Damage / MaxHealth) * (3 - 2 * HealthPercentAfterDamage)<br />
<br />
Damage is the full damage of the hit, before absorbs, before Stagger. HealthPercentAfterDamage is with stagger taken into account, but not other absorbs. Mitigation does reduce Damage. In your example, Damage would be 100k.<br />
<br />
Okay, so mitigation reduces Damage, and HealthPercentAfterDamage. Stagger reduces HealthpercentAfterDamage. However, GotO does not proc off of the Stagger DoT, so what happens is this:<br />
<br />
Player 1 is at 100% health and does not use ISB. They generate X orbs over the next 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
Player 2 is also at 100% health and DOES use ISB, but does not Purify. Both players take the same amount of damage over the next 10 seconds, however Player 2 gets less than X orbs because each individual melee swing is lower, yet their health is getting reduced all the same because Stagger is ticking.<br />
<br />
What happens here is that, if you are trying to play like a good tank and smooth your damage all of the time, you get fewer orbs EVEN IF you maintain the same health level. Naturally, this means that many good players will see far fewer orbs than someone that knows the &quot;secret&quot; to playing BrM.<br />
<br />
Change the HealthPercentAfterDamage variable to just Current Health and retune it a little. You already have Damage/Max Health representing the size of the hit, so the delta in health is already being counted and it doesn't need to be counted again.<br />
<br />
This should result in the proper amount of orbs being seen for good players, which will make them safer when they drop low, which should ease the feeling of dying whenever they don't have ISB up.<br />
Kind of. Right problem, different solution. We're going to err in the player's favor here, and make HealthPercentAfterDamage based on the same Damage amount as the left part of the equation is (ie, the full damage of the hit, before absorbs, before stagger, instead of after stagger).<br />
<br />
OLD: (0.75 * Damage / MaxHealth) * (3 - 2 * (CurrentHealth - (Damage - Stagger)) / MaxHealth)<br />
NEW: (0.75 * Damage / MaxHealth) * (3 - 2 * (CurrentHealth - Damage) / MaxHealth)<br />
<br />
That will ensure that ISB doesn't reduce the chance to generate an orb on any given attack (but still will on the next attack by virtue of being higher health).<br />
<br />
Is that before damage reduction? meaning the RAW un-mitigated damage?<br />
No, neither of those are before armor or any other actual DR effect. It's just before Stagger/Absorbs.<br />
<br />
Also, out of almost 1,000 Ox orbs, none of them proc'd Celestial Fortune.<br />
<br />
Also, they disperse after a short time, ranging from 21 seconds to 28 seconds. If you're greater than a 8ish yards away from them when they do, they will not heal you.<br />
Gift of the Ox + Celestial Fortune fixed for next build.<br />
<br />
They last 30sec, always.<br />
<br />
My post was about how I suggest you play Brewmaster, not healers.<br />
<br />
I didn't say that healers should let you sit at low health; that's putting words in my mouth. Healers should generally heal you the same as any other tank, just with the knowledge that it's safer to use more efficient heals. For example, a healer may typically keep a HoT rolling, and use lots of normal Heals while you're above 80%, and switch to Flash Heal if you drop below that. With a Brewmaster, they can probably stick to normal Heals for longer, switching to Flashes only at 60% or something. That's an over-simplified picture of things, but that's the general idea. It doesn't mean to stop healing them.<br />
<br />
You also shouldn't try to take more damage. Stagger is a very powerful mechanic, and it lets you choose when you take damage, and when you don't (or rather, take way way less). The whole point of this is to minimize damage, and take that damage at opportune times (when you're not in danger).<br />
<br />
Thanks for the constructive discussion on this, it's been great.<br />
<br />
We think it's fairly intuitive and works well, that you have limited brew charges, and so want to use them when in danger and not when not in danger. However, the further amplification of that through Gift of the Ox is a little too much of a stretch for people to notice (buried in the Gift of the Ox tooltip) and play around.<br />
<br />
We also agree with many of the discussed issues that the healing spheres in general pose.<br />
<br />
We have the following further revisions planned:<br />
<br />
<br />
Gift of the Ox will now drop healing spheres more consistently*, but will no longer drop them more frequently when you are at low health, baseline.<br />
Secret Ingredients has been replaced with a new talent, Gift of the Mists: Passive. Gift of the Ox has an up to 100% increased chance to trigger, based on your missing health.<br />
Expel Harm has returned for Brewmasters:<br />
Expel Harm<br />
Instant, 15 Energy<br />
Draw in the positive chi of all Healing Spheres within 30 yards, and expel negative chi, damaging the nearest enemy for 10% of the amount healed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let us know how this feels when you get a chance to try it in the next build. Thanks!<br />
<br />
* Theorycrafter info: It's no longer a random chance, under the hood. When you are hit, it increments a counter by (DamageTakenBeforeAbsorbsOrStagger / MaxHealth). It now drops an orb whenever that reaches 1.0, and decrements it by 1.0. The tooltip still says ‘chance’, to keep it understandable. Gift of the Mists multiplies that counter increment by (2 - (HealthBeforeDamage - DamageTakenBeforeAbsorbsOrStagger) / MaxHealth); ie, a simple linear 0-100% increase based on missing health, counting the hit as a full hit.<br />
<br />
I would also suggest a UI display for how many orbs are within 30 yards. This could be shown on the Expel Harm tooltip.<br />
It will be. The count of Healing Spheres (with Greater Healing Spheres from the artifact counting as 2) will be shown on the Expel Harm button. When there are no Healing Spheres, the button will be disabled.

Road to BlizzCon 2016 Rules Clarification<br />
Following our recent blog (link) detailing some updates to the rules for the 2016 World of Warcraft Road to BlizzCon, we’ve seen some questions about the rationale behind some of those changes. We’d like to go into more detail on our thinking to help you better understand why we made these changes and why we think they’re the right decisions for the 2016 Arena Championship—and once you’ve had a chance to hear our thoughts, we’d love for you to share any further feedback or concerns you might have.<br />
<br />
Every rule change we’re making this year is fully intended to support the Arena community. We made some great strides forward in that regard with the 2015 Road to BlizzCon, and we want to continue that trend in 2016.<br />
<br />
Regarding the roster swap rules, there are several contributing factors to our decision to allow one roster swap between qualifiers and regionals. For example, Legion will be rolling out during this time frame, which brings some sweeping changes to classes and other gameplay elements critical to the Arena. Because it will be very difficult (if not impossible) to predict exactly how that will affect everything, we want teams to have a bit of extra flexibility to adjust. We also felt that last year’s roster rules were stricter than they needed to be and wanted to relax them just slightly. We feel that this is the right choice for World of Warcraft competition in 2016.<br />
<br />
Next, we wanted to talk about why we’re allowing teams who have already qualified to compete in further events. One of our main goals here is to increase exposure—as well as income opportunities—for top WoW Arena teams. It’s similar to the approach we take with our other games, and even outside of Blizzard, it’s fairly common practice to allow—even encourage—players or teams who’ve qualified for a regional (or equivalent) to continue playing in events leading up to that regional.<br />
<br />
This approach provides a number of advantages that can help an esport grow: Viewers are able to see their favorite players and teams competing in more events, which helps those players and teams form a stronger fanbase. Teams have the potential to earn more prize money and get more sponsorship opportunities earlier on, supporting their ability to participate in esports as a career. It’s also worth mentioning that we plan for the qualifier cups to use a double-elimination system this year.<br />
<br />
Overall, we feel that allowing teams to compete in multiple events is a good move forward for the growth of WoW esports, but like I said, it’s a change we made to help our top WoW teams. We’ve already been speaking directly with several top-level players and competitors—including previous BlizzCon champions—about these changes, but we’re definitely interested in additional feedback from everyone in the community now that you have a bit more context. If you disagree with this change, what exactly concerns you about it? <br />
<br />
We all want to make WoW esports the best it can be, and your constructive feedback is greatly appreciated to help us achieve that. Thanks for all the great discussion so far.<br />
<br />
First I would like to see what other examples you guys are looking at where this happens. Perhaps it works well and we just are not aware.<br />
StarCraft, Heroes of the Storm, and Hearthstone’s esports programs all allow qualified teams to compete in further events. It's also common practice in fighting games, and obviously anything that's using a league structure (by which I mean that teams aren’t prohibited from participating in league play once they’ve qualified for a championship event). Many non-Blizzard games that we’d consider major esports use a league structure, which admittedly isn’t an exact 1-to-1 comparison to WoW’s Road to BlizzCon.<br />
<br />
What we’re proposing is more similar to StarCraft, Heroes and Hearthstone's systems. Having said that, we of course realize that just because it works for those games doesn't mean it will work for WoW. That’s why we wanted to provide some extra context, and ask how you guys feel about it.<br />

According to Youtube comments, homosexuals now own the rainbow. Oh dear gods, we can't have anything pretty or fun just because it is rainbow colored. It is a toy ffs.<br />
<br />
I hate this macho sh.t. Like it suddenly changes your personality or sexual orientation. Gods save us from liking some shiny thing. Don't like it? Don't use it. Not mandatory.<br />
<br />
Also thanks for the giveaway!<br />
<br />
It isn't Macho shit, it is immature shit. I consider myself a pretty masculine guy, but even I enjoy the Rainbow things.<br />
<br />
Most people that get worked up over rainbows and correlations to homosexuality generally are just immature or closet homosexuals, or both.</div></div><hr />

I would guess because they're checking to make sure that the Battle.net functionality works on their backend; WarcraftLogs and Wowhead and AskMrRobot have all had Battle.net interfacing in for a while now, but every website's backend is different and it's way easier to find bugs when you have a lot more than one or two people throwing stuff at the wall.<br />
<br />
I'm a little disappointed that the wardrobe wasn't on that list of &quot;what are you most looking forward to&quot; though, as to be honest I'm not super excited about ANY of the actual given choices but I AM chomping at the bit for the implications of account-wide Shirts, haha.</div></div><hr />

Eh? Maybe some are, what is your problem? Besides some play FEMALE mages, why only make effects that are strictly for males? Some could feel hurt if rainbow was only available for female mages. If its glyph noone tells you to use it if you dont want.<br />

Morhaime: You already swore me one oath, right here in the TOS. You swore that you would ABIDE BY ALL THE OLD RULES AND THE NEW.<br />

Syrah: On my honor as a developer. On my honor to Nostalrius. Let us go, or I'll kill your intern! <br />

Blizzard has an API (using Oauth login), which allows websites to login to Battle.Net.<br />
It uses Blizzard's authentication servers.<br />
<br />
Proof: https://dev.battle.net/docs/read/oauth<br />
<br />
I know that but I'm still not doing it lol. It just feels shady, I mean why does MMO Champ need all my characters and info? It's just a game and who really cares but I got 9+ years of my online life in my characters so I err on the side of (sometimes ignorant) extremes when it comes to my account.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chaud</div><div class="date">2016-04-30, 06:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Could someone please explain why exactly would getting access to peoples' battletags and lists of characters be essential for polls and giveaways?<br />
It isn't for this, but it allows us to collect some data for testing and in the future will allow us to run polls that ask about raid progression and such with more accuracy than just letting anyone vote whatever they want. <br />
<br />
<br />
PollDaddy, right? Currently even in safe mode (with no addons loaded) the latest Firefox beta is not loading the poll.<br />
<br />
If you check your javascript console (Ctrl + Shift + i), do you see something along the lines of:<br />
<br />
&quot;The resource at &quot;http://static.polldaddy.com/p/9403287.js&quot; was blocked because tracking protection is enabled&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Can anyone explain why we need to login to battle.net for the contest? If this was any other site id 100% think its a scam , i won't enter just because its mmo-champ either but im just wondering why?<br />
<br />
<br />
Uh, love the contest prize, but HELL no on logging into bnet ANYWHERE but bnet. I'm surprised that this is even legal.<br />
<br />
(I'm not checking the thread to see if anyone else has said it. If 2,000,000 people have already said it, it STILL hasn't been said enough.)<br />
<br />
It allows us to contact winners without requiring an account on mmo-champion, as well as gives us some data for testing. You can read more about logging in to third party sites via Battle.Net here (https://dev.battle.net/docs/read/oauth). Be sure that you only enter your Battle.Net username and password when actually on the battle.net site by checking your address bar. We don't actually receive your username or password.<br />
<br />
<br />
Could I recommend adding a conditional to it (if you can), to hide it or change it once you're logged in. It really confused me at first.<br />
<br />
Yeah, we definitely will in the future. Today was just about making sure the login process is working right on our end.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is completely unrelated to logging in here. We take you to a page with information that sends you to the Battle.Net site, you log in on Battle.Net, and they redirect you back to us with a token that lets us request your BattleTag and list of characters. Your login information is never sent to us.<br />
<br />
The only way it could be related is if you had an existing keylogger on your system and it captured you signing in to Battle.Net.</div></div><hr />

My own addition to the first poll would be the xmog cabinet. It may seem silly, but it's really what I'm looking forward to the most. I need my bag space back! Right now I can't even go farm for pretty gear like I usually do at the end of expansions, because I have no room to put any more, and I'm not throwing anything away. I'm in the Alpha, and I love the artifact weapons too (that's what I voted for in the poll), but seriously....the xmog cabinet is what's making me wish Legion was coming sooner.<br />
<br />
PS: People are really killing me with the fear of logging in with their Bnet account. Maybe if you didn't lie about your raid progression all the time, you wouldn't be so paranoid. Seriously, not everyone has had Mythic on farm for 4 months....or have any interest in going in that mode at all.</div></div><hr />

Fair enough, thanks for the clarification. (Even though why would someone lie about something like that on some poll is beyond me, it's not like they're gonna get any personal - fake - fame from it or anything, but I won't claim it doesn't happen.) However, I'm pretty private person and I feel like my battletag and characters are not any strangers' business and thus I'll pass. I do realize it would be pretty much just &quot;faceless&quot; data among countless others and nobody would pay it any particular attention, but even so.</div></div><hr />

Well I'm sorry to say but people thinking that they are giving away their login details is mostly your fault for not explaining it properly.<br />
<br />
You should have made it very clear that people are logging in to Blizzards servers, which then hand out a token that allows curse to query the users battle tag and the chars. <br />
<br />
The way you put it &quot;click the button to log in&quot; is pretty ambiguous - this could also mean giving you the login data.<br />
Now people who know about this stuff will assume that you're leveraging OAuth, but you can't really blame people for assuming the worst, when you're not explaining it properly.<br />
<br />
I understand that this is a learning process for you as well, but there's no need for snide remarks - especially when those comments are (or should be) helping you in understanding how to better convey things to your users.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm pretty chilled and actually trying to help. <br />
<br />
You see we have been telling people for years to not reuse their passwords and to not enter their credentials at random sites. <br />
<br />
Now I would see responses like &quot;I won't give away my login data&quot; as a success in that regard. And I find it inappropriate to belittle those people now - after all they are just following the advice security people have given them over and over.<br />
<br />
If you don't explain why it is ok to login in this case but not ok to login to their bank by following a random email link, you can't really expect them not to be upset about that request.<br />
<br />
Being snide about it achieves only 2 things IMHO - either people learn they are the laughing stock when they are concerned about entering their credentials or they loose their trust in this site. <br />
So if you explain these things properly on the main page and if needed in the comments it's a win-win - otherwise everyone looses, except those fake banking sites maybe :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
