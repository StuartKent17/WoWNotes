New Character Models - Female Dwarf Update<br />
The official website (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/warlords-of-draenor/) was updated with some new female Dwarf screenshots today to show off other hairstyles and an updated face (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/446728164329271296).<br />

<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor PvP<br />
There is one stat on gear which increases your character's health, while every single other stat increases your damage.<br />
You guys halved the Stam budget when we moved from Vanilla to TBC to help combat a deteriorating damage to health pool ratio. Maybe it's simply time to do that again, possibly drop the budget even more than half. <br />
<br />
That's exactly what I meant when I said we'd be increasing the effectiveness of Stamina. You will get significantly more health per point. I don't have the exact amount per point handy, but the jist of it is that the Stamina on your gear will be enough to increase your health pool at roughly the same rate that everything else increases your damage/healing output.<br />
<br />
As well there should be massive differences between people in green and people in conquest. What the heck is the point, and what motivation would people have to actually get pvp gear when greens are just as good.<br />
There are shades of grey here. Of course, someone who is fully kitted out in Conquest gear should have no issue taking out someone whose first action at level 100 was to queue for a battleground. Building up and improving your character is an important part of World of Warcraft gameplay, including in PvP, and we have no intention of changing that.<br />
<br />
However, the player who immediately queues for a battleground at level 100 is probably pretty excited to get into PvP, and it's heartbreaking to suddenly find out that you're not just disadvantaged, you're completely ineffective. The level 100 shouldn't be on equal footing with players that have spent time and effort gearing up, but they also shouldn't feel like they can't contribute to their team's success -- and their teammates shouldn't feel like they're essentially down a player.<br />
<br />
A fresh 100 should absolutely, categorically, 100% be completely aware that they're going to need better gear to go toe to toe with the big cats, but they shouldn't feel like litter in the meantime. Follow?<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
Will tanks have that chance completely removed by selecting tank spec?<br />
Yes. Tanks get -3% chance to be parried. (Could still be parried by a +4, technically, if you're fighting something underlevel) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/439835599957024768))<br />
“Could still be parried by a +4, technically, if you're fighting something underlevel&quot; Will level ?? bosses still be +3?<br />
Yes, bosses count as YourLevel+3. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/439934742381617152))<br />
<br />
How will the final tick for HoTs be calculated? Is it average tickspeed, base tickspeed, or tickspeed when the hot drops of?<br />
Tick speed (period) for the last full tick. Haste is recalculated on every tick. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/441344564280819712))<br />
If not then it will still be valuable to be slightly above breakpoints (for the smallest possible extra tick dmg)<br />
Won't matter if you don't let your DoTs fall off. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/441354467087101953))<br />
<br />
i am excited for the healing changes. Looking forward to not having millions and millions of overhealing as a monk.<br />
Yeah... Wasn't it cool when overhealing was regarded as a bad thing? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/442168008828395522))<br />
<br />
Do you think limiting mobility on healers will make fights less complex and fun? Blade Lord and Durumu would be much harder.<br />
Absolutely. Content is tailored the abilities of classes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/442180269429100545))<br />
<br />
How will the new smart healing work? Your HST totem healing the guy at 90% instead of the one at 10% will be really frustrating<br />
We want (and you should want) *you* to heal the guy at 10%. We want *you* to feel like the hero, not your smart healing totem. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/442227425699573760))<br />
<br />
Overall, healers dont like crit, usually just ends up overhealing. But true for the rest.<br />
Great example of the problem. If your allies spend more time between 0% and 100%, then it won't usually be overhealing. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/442251793032941568))<br />
<br />
Why are you removing the low cost basic heal and leave two high cost basic heals? Shouldn't 1 high cost be removed instead?<br />
The cost isn't really what matters; the efficiency is. We're leaving one high throughput, one high efficiency. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/442254959782793216))<br />
<br />
Character / Items<br />
Slight change in topic: plans to nerf Heroic Garrosh mount chance? If so, pre-patch (6.0) or WoD release?<br />
Yep, same as Invincible and such, will go to a low % chance, but not before WoD release. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/442360365590913024))<br />
<br />
Will the Pandaren Phoenix mounts become account wide after Pandaren Challenge Modes end?<br />
Not currently planned. They're being treated like PvP mounts. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/442707785533247489))<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor Stats<br />
Character progression is one of the hallmarks of any role-playing game, so we're nerfing you 30 levels trust us it's better.<br />
It's telling that many (most?) people who played at Blizzcon didn't even notice the squish. It's really not a big deal. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/439287654618656768))<br />
<br />
IE we'll get a spike during WoD, but then before 7.0 everything will scale down to be inline with others, then ramp<br />
May repeat the process eventually, but this squish buys a fair bit of time. Don't view it as an every xpac thing. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/439394214615347200))<br />
Who can we blame for pushing a squish instead of doing the right thing and updating the codebase with long ints?<br />
You can blame me if you like. It's a design call, not a technical one. We don't want to see +13759 Strength helms. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/439535572416081920))<br />
so it was a lie when they told us it was a technical limitation. Great. Stay classy blizzard developers.<br />
Designers aren't programmers, and not every inaccurate statement is a lie. It WAS a technical hurdle, but not insurmountable (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/439556814506434560))<br />
<br />
Proving Grounds<br />
Random idea: What about PG Silver rewarding the entry level blue weapon that we've gotten from e.g. Crucible of Carnage before?<br />
That idea came up internally the other day: possibly a one-time quest for getting Bronze at 100. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/439076242579390464))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
I may be missing it somewhere but is Ashran going to be instanced or something like the TI where you fly to and boom in the action?<br />
It will use some new tech. It is instanced but you won't feel the transition (no load screen). (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/441457354811256832))<br />
<br />
I can queue as a tank and finish a 5-man in 10 minutes for a near-guaranteed 250 honor. BG takes that just to get in, no guarantee.<br />
A combination of high JP rewards and a well-intentioned but easily abused currency conversion. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/442808730589999105))<br />
We could easily have turned off the conversion long ago but trying not to be mean. Perhaps we should. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/442809102989676544))<br />

AskMrRobot Combat Log<br />
AskMrRobot (http://www.askmrrobot.com/) has been working on a new combat log tool! If you play one of the less popular specs (http://blog.askmrrobot.com/2014/03/combat-log-alpha-so-close-i-can-taste-it/), they might still need combat logs (http://blog.askmrrobot.com/2013/12/combat-log-ultra-alpha/) from you. <br />
<br />
You can find a full list of the remaining specs on their blog, as well as a few previews of the tool. (Player overview (http://blog.askmrrobot.com/2014/01/combat-log-preview-player-breakdown/), Healer and Tank overview (http://blog.askmrrobot.com/2014/02/combat-log-preview-healer-tank-overview/), Fight overview (http://blog.askmrrobot.com/2014/01/combat-log-preview-damage-overview/))<br />

<br />
This so much. The old face looked fairly masculine for a female model. It was a subtle change to what looks like the nose, chin line, and the texture that softened up her features just enough to make her look like a woman while keeping that burly rough around the edges look.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This 100%. It looks so much better than before. I still think under the eyes is a bit dark (like haven't slept in 10 days dark) but that is just minor compared to the issues on the first model.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OGXanos</div><div class="date">2014-03-21, 05:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">SO much better. I don't cringe at this one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think they'd change something like that over a single person's feedback. The easiest way to get honor right now really is via PvE, which is just fine if you're using it for catchup gear to combat bad LFR RNG, but less so if you actually want to PvP and earn your gear by PvPing.<br />
<br />
(Honestly, this points to the need for a better PvE catchup system than going into LFR and praying the piece you need drops, but...)</div></div><hr />

to be honest i don't think they could make the dwarf female look any better, they're hideous... besides i always thought the only way you can tell them apart from the male counterparts was they had two beards ...<br />
<br />
<br />
never understood why if Dwarfs are Scandinavian (in culture similarities) why do they always get represented by (bad) (very bad) Scottish accents.... odd.</div></div><hr />

LOL! That was just way too funny for me to let pass. :D<br />

Love that they're (so far) managing to keep the 'look and feel' of the characters intact and still make them look updated and renewed. In this case, bulky and feminine while holding a mug of beer at the same time: that's the female dwarf for 'ya!</div></div><hr />

The level 100 shouldn't be on equal footing with players that have spent time and effort gearing up, but they also shouldn't feel like they can't contribute to their team's success -- and their teammates shouldn't feel like they're essentially down a player.<br />
<br />
A fresh 100 should absolutely, categorically, 100% be completely aware that they're going to need better gear to go toe to toe with the big cats, but they shouldn't feel like litter in the meantime. Follow?<br />

Can someone explain what Blizzard means here? They are adjusting stamina so that we don't need resilience? Also, just how high are our healthpools going to be at lvl 100? Thanks.</div></div><hr />

A combination of high JP rewards and a well-intentioned but easily abused currency conversion. (holinka)<br />
We could easily have turned off the conversion long ago but trying not to be mean. Perhaps we should. (holinka)<br />
<br />
This would suck. Really hope they don't do this. Honor gear is great for filling in gear gaps on my alts to get them LFR-ready, and if I had to get plowed in BGs to get it I wouldn't even bother at all.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrile</div><div class="date">2014-03-21, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think they'd change something like that over a single person's feedback. The easiest way to get honor right now really is via PvE, which is just fine if you're using it for catchup gear to combat bad LFR RNG, but less so if you actually want to PvP and earn your gear by PvPing.<br />
<br />
(Honestly, this points to the need for a better PvE catchup system than going into LFR and praying the piece you need drops, but...)<br />
<br />
There are a string of problems wrapped around each other that cause the JP to HP conversion to seem broken. Ultimately it comes down to the fact that you must win BGs to get decent HP... so you deal with a queue and then a 50% chance to get decent HP. They can´t boost HP for losing, because that would just encourage more botting.<br />
<br />
It is just a lot of effort to fix something that is basically for crap starter gear anyway. Sure, it would be great if the best way to earn that gear was from PvP.. but if you fix that, you create different and worse problems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because enough people do play them, and it's great that they want to deliver a quality product to everyone, not just those of the most popular races?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Just curious...haven't dwarven females traditionally been the smallest group of class/gender combos? Wouldn't they be the prime candidate for last to implement? I may be wrong, but they always seemed to be the hardest to find for some holiday achievements and such.<br />
<br />
<br />
The designers release these models when they feel they're ready to be released. They also quite apparently don't work on them in order of most popular to least popular, else male Orcs and male Dwarves would have been pretty low in the presentation order, instead of being presented first at Blizzcon. If it went by popularity, Blood Elves, Night Elves and Humans would have been the first to be presented.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
My thoughts on the face:<br />
<br />
It looks a lot better now! :) I'm glad the designers improved the face. Personally, I still think the facial features are a bit too big, the forehead's a bit too small, and the eyes look a bit bloodshot, but this may well all be intentional for the femdwarf. Looking forward to seeing more faces, I plan on making a fem. Dwarf Paladin or Shaman when the new models come :)</div></div><hr />

If they removed JP&gt;HP conversion, people would start queueing (not everyone, some would rage at the thought of pvping for pvp gear). I kinda hope they do. Its not even that much faster, unless you roll alliance. Then, I sympathize.</div></div><hr />

Most? I've been bging the last week, and with few exceptions, most of the opponents are boosters in either greens or 496 TI gear. You can easily do randoms right now and avoid getting rolled over. And if randoms are going badly, direct queue AV/IOC if alliance, or SotA/SSM if horde. &quot;Play&quot; now, brother.</div></div><hr />

Actually, in warcrafts lord of the clans game where you play as thrall, and he turns into a dwarf to explore aerie peak (its early warcraft, let it slide), when thrall meets the female dwarves, they all have thick long beards.<br />
