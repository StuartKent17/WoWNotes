With the launch of each new expansion there are certain items, achievements, and mounts which become unobtainable. Here is a quick rundown of things you might want to get done in the next couple of days!<br />
<br />
Achievements<br />
Antorus the Burning Throne<br />
A lot of the achievements being removed revolve around raiding. As always, with the launch of a new raid tier or new expansion, Ahead of the Curve (https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/12110-ahead-of-the-curve-argus-the-unmaker) for defeating the final boss on Heroic, and Cutting Edge (https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/12111-cutting-edge-argus-the-unmaker) for defeating Argus on Mythic are being removed. <br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/june/thumb/argustheunmaker.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/june/argustheunmaker.jpg) <br />
<br />
The Antoran Charhound (https://www.wowdb.com/items/152816-antoran-charhound) is remaining as is, but the Shackled Ur'zul (https://www.wowdb.com/items/152789-shackled-urzul) that drops from Mythic Argus, and the Fiendish Hellfire Core (https://www.wowdb.com/items/137575-fiendish-hellfire-core) that drops from Mythic Gul'dan will have its drop rate drastically reduced after Battle for Azeroth is live.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/july/FiendishHellfireCore.jpg (https://www.wowdb.com/items/137575-fiendish-hellfire-core) https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/june/thumb/shackledurzul.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/june/shackledurzul.jpg) <br />
<br />
It is believed that the Kirin Tor Summoning Crystal (https://www.wowdb.com/items/152901-kirin-tor-summoning-crystal), which awards the Violet Spellwing (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/253639-violet-spellwing) mount, will no longer be obtainable after the launch of Battle for Azeroth. You can obtain this mount from defeating Heroic Argus the Unmaker and doing the quick quest Blood of a Titan (https://www.wowdb.com/quests/48954-blood-of-a-titan) from Blood of the Unmaker (https://www.wowdb.com/items/152900-blood-of-the-unmaker) looted from the body.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Trial of Valor<br />
The Chosen (https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/11387-the-chosen) Achievement in the Trial of Valor is being removed, and along with it the title will no longer be obtainable. While this is one of the more difficult achievements to obtain, there are some weekly pug groups who can defeat it successfully. This achievement requires you to complete Mythic Trial of Valor without dying to any of the bosses with the Test of the Chosen (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/232301-test-of-the-chosen) buff. You receive a Mythic colored transmog appearance for the Trial of Valor transmogs on top of the title for completing this achievement.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
In the Professions category, all of the First Aid achievements are being moved to the Legacy section. Because of the removal of this profession, it is very likely that all of the achievements that involve it will also be unobtainable. Most of these are currently easily obtainable, however the Field Medic (https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/11139-field-medic) might take some time to complete.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/june/thumb/fieldmedic.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/june/fieldmedic.jpg)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
In PvP there are two large PvP instances as well as some transmog items being removed. The Legion Elite sets will no longer be obtainable after the last arena season ends. If your character did reach the needed arena rating, you will still be able to purchase the set later. <br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/june/thumb/pvpelite.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/june/pvpelite.jpg)<br />
<br />
Strand of the Ancients and Ashran are also being retired along with all of their achievements. Some of these may see a return at a later date if the battlegrounds return in a special category of battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/june/thumb/standoftheancients.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/june/standoftheancients.jpg) https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/june/thumb/ashran.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/june/ashran.jpg) <br />
<br />
<br />
Artifact Appearance<br />
Most Artifact appearances will remain available for collection after patch 8.0. Currently, the only appearance which needs to be completed before that is the base appearance of the Mage Tower Challenge. As long as the base appearance is unlocked prior to the prepatch you will still be able to obtain the different color of the weapon. The Mage Tower is permanently available until Patch 8.0 is live to give players a chance to complete all of the ones that they desire to obtain.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Brawler’s Guild<br />
The Brawler’s Guild, along with the rewards and bosses, will likely be retiring for a set time when Battle for Azeroth launches. If you want to experience some interesting solo content, the Brawler’s Guild has some engaging challenges. After obtaining an invitation you can participate in your faction's capital city. The rewards will most likely be available again if the Brawler's Guild continues as it has in the past couple of expansions.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/june/thumb/brawler.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/june/brawler.jpg)<br />
<br />
<br />
Pet Battle Charms<br />
Current pet charms are being converted into Shiny Pet Charm (https://beta.wowdb.com/items/116415-shiny-pet-charm) in the prepatch and will now only be used to purchase pets from Legion and Warlords content. You might want to stock up on Ultimate Battle-Training Stone (https://beta.wowdb.com/items/122457-ultimate-battle-training-stone) now as Battle for Azeroth will introduce a new pet battle currency called Polished Pet Charm (https://beta.wowdb.com/items/163036-polished-pet-charm) which will be used to purchase any pet battle items in current content.<br />
<br />
<br />
Order Hall Missions and Items<br />
The prepatch will also do away with your prized 18 hour World Quest auto completion ability for certain classes as well as gold missions from the mission table.<br />
<br />
<br />
Things That Might be Harder in Battle For Azeroth<br />
This section is dedicated to things that are not necessarily limited to Legion, but you will most likely have an easier time doing them before we move into the next expansion.<br />
<br />
Long-Forgotten Hippogryph<br />
Currently all realms are limited to their own realms shard, making it easier to collect all the crystals necessary to obtain the mount. Once the next patch hits, all realms will move to a Cross Realm Zone system, increasing the competition to obtain the mount. <br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/july/longForgotten.jpg (https://www.wowdb.com/items/138258-reins-of-the-long-forgotten-hippogryph) <br />
<br />
<br />
Raiding and Dungeons<br />
The Glory achievements for all of the Legion raids and dungeons will be much more difficult to complete once the new expansion launches. Even though at some point most of them will be soloable, some achievements require multiple players, and finding a group to complete them is much easier while we are still in Legion. <br />
<br />
Glory achievement rewards:<br />
<br />
Glory of the Legion Raider (https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/11180-glory-of-the-legion-raider) - Defiled Reins (https://www.wowdb.com/items/141216-defiled-reins)<br />
Glory of the Tomb Raider (https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/11763-glory-of-the-tomb-raider) - Title: %s, the Tomb Raider and Micronax Controller (https://www.wowdb.com/items/101426-micronax-controller)<br />
Glory of the Argus Raider (https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/11987-glory-of-the-argus-raider) - Antoran Gloomhound (https://www.wowdb.com/items/152815-antoran-gloomhound)<br />
Glory of the Legion Hero (https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/11163-glory-of-the-legion-hero) - Reins of the Leyfeather Hippogryph (https://www.wowdb.com/items/141217-reins-of-the-leyfeather-hippogryph)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Fishing<br />
Legion has fishing pools that are easier to do with a large groups of players. Conjurer Margoss has a fishing pool near Dalaran, and if you fish up enough Drowned Mana, you can purchase lures, bobbers, the Sting Ray Pup (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/109216-sting-ray-pup) companion, and the Brinedeep Bottom-Feeder (https://www.wowdb.com/items/138811-brinedeep-bottom-feeder) mount.<br />
<br />
The Fisherfriend of the Isles (https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/11725-fisherfriend-of-the-isles) achievement is also quicker to complete in the current patch, because it requires players to fish up special items, similar to Conjurer Margoss, making farming the reputation in large groups much more efficient.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Talon's Vengeance<br />
If you want to collect the Ivory Hawkstrider (https://www.wowdb.com/items/142369-ivory-hawkstrider) mount, you might want to start grinding the Talon's Vengeance reputation to obtain the Ivory Feather (https://www.wowdb.com/items/142367-ivory-feather). This can be done by obtaining the Ivory Feather (https://www.wowdb.com/items/142367-ivory-feather), which you can use in the Falcosaur and PvP World Quest areas to obtain Marks of Prey (https://www.wowdb.com/items/142363-mark-of-prey) that increase your reputation with the faction.<br />

Farming Nalak might be more difficult since he doesn't have the damage reduction staging aura that Sha does. Might get one shot by BFA abilities. But that's a niche thing and we don't know how that will play out.<br />

What in the fuck is all this removal of shit? Strand? Ashran? First Aid? My only question is...why? I just don't understand the reasoning here. Even if people aren't playing these things or using first aid very much, they still have the option. I see no reason to outright remove it. What's always made WoW so great was the incredible amount of choice you had in the game. It gives you a certain sense of freedom that you're taking away when you remove things that have been there forever. If (when) I come back to play, I want to be able to go do what I did years ago or finish doing what I started years ago if I feel like it. <br />
<br />
I'm not completely devastated by these losses, I just don't understand it and I'm more concerned about the future and if this will become a common thing. I will miss SoTA (even though it was a bitch to complete the meta for Battlemaster and this will probably make it much easier) and first aid's been around for longer than some players have been alive. I still remember having to go do the quests for the manuals and stuff like up in Arathi Highlands, lol. Bandages have given me the edge and saved me from a gank more than once.</div></div><hr />

<br />
what makes you say this? Checking on beta... Last time I checked lock / warrior got 15% success chance on missions with minions, dk, pala and mage got &quot;get 100 order resources when completing WQ with a combat ally&quot; and DH was bugged (trait wasn't replaced, but the crystal was greyed out and the npc for fel cannon couldn't be talked to), I expect this to be fixed for live. <br />
<br />
Also most sources of gold are either nerfed (WQs, combat ally trinkets, paragon caches) or outright cut (gold missions). Expected tbh.<br />

Bandages have given me the edge and saved me from a gank more than once. Bandages are still there, they're moved to tailoring. Anti venoms are moved to alchemy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not sure about Ashran, but they're probably removing Strand because it's a terrible BG and a relic from when Blizzard tried to push the vehicle mechanic in WotLK. Their BG pool is quite big now so removing the shitty ones lowers queue time for people. I don't know if this is the case yet but they'll probably start using a rotation like in HotS to lower the queue even more.</div></div><hr />

Once the next patch hits, all realms will move to a Cross Realm Zone system, increasing the competition to obtain the mount.<br />

That is for PvP only ( War mode on )</div></div><hr />

At least on my realm. I know when I got my Long-Lost Hippogryph, it was during an invasion and cross realm was definitely enabled as I was seeing players from other realms doing the invasion quests. That mount will only be harder to get in BfA because the invasions won't distract players from finding the crystals anymore.</div></div><hr />

WAAAAAIIIIIIIIIITT they are playing on a meta level. They remove content so when legacy expansions come we all want to try them out and get things what are not achievable on the current one. Jeeeeeeeeeeez That is some next level bullsh*t. Greed is real Blizzard.<br />
<br />
BGs should not be running simulators... But who cares 5% of the playerbase participate regularly in PVP anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can use the Medallion of the Legion to get rep with them still (tested it on Beta as someone else asked me the same thing). Vendor is also outside Ashran.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palemoon</div><div class="date">2018-07-16, 07:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't played seriously since fairly early into Legion. What in the fuck is all this removal of shit? Strand? Ashran? First Aid? My only question is...why? I just don't understand the reasoning here. Even if people aren't playing these things or using first aid very much, they still have the option. I see no reason to outright remove it. What's always made WoW so great was the incredible amount of choice you had in the game. It gives you a certain sense of freedom that you're taking away when you remove things that have been there forever. If (when) I come back to play, I want to be able to go do what I did years ago or finish doing what I started years ago if I feel like it. <br />
<br />
I'm not completely devastated by these losses, I just don't understand it and I'm more concerned about the future and if this will become a common thing. I will miss SoTA (even though it was a bitch to complete the meta for Battlemaster and this will probably make it much easier) and first aid's been around for longer than some players have been alive. I still remember having to go do the quests for the manuals and stuff like up in Arathi Highlands, lol. Bandages have given me the edge and saved me from a gank more than once.<br />
<br />
Strand is being removed because they also remove the ability to blacklist BGs when queueing. If I remember correctly, there was an interview where a dev talked about how they analyzed all the data (least played, most blacklisted, etc.), and Strand had more &quot;do not want to touch&quot; than the following BGs combined.<br />
<br />
Ashran....no clue, honestly.<br />
<br />
As for first aid, it's not as terrible as it sounds. The thing is, while it did have its use ages ago, most people just do not care about first aid these days. Using a bandage isn't a staple of raid healing anymore (I remember all the &quot;Use bandages in X phase of Molten Core if you're a melee&quot; and all that), and most people would be hard pressed to remember when they actually last time used a bandage. The healing amount is negligible as well from a time/output perspective.<br />
<br />
Thus they're nixing the profession. Bandages are being moved to tailoring and healing potions to alchemy. As a result, all the achievements will move over to FOS.<br />
<br />
On the upside, in the last weeks at least there were ample farming groups for the Field Medic achievement for once.</div></div><hr />

Seriously? More people had sota on ignore than fucking isle of conquest? Bullshit. Also, removing the abillity to blacklist bg's is bullshit as well.</div></div><hr />

Has Blizzard confirmed this? I got my 2k rating for this season's elite gear but I would like to get the Tomb of Sarg mythic lookalike set.</div></div><hr />

I only ever did the PvP world quests to progress the falcosaur pet questlines, which I did when they were still new. Otherwise, I avoid everything even tangentially related to PvP. So no, never saw that.</div></div><hr />

They're moving Ilse of Conquest and Alterac Valley to separate queues though, that should make up for a bit of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think a lot of Horde have IoC blacklisted, but far fewer Alliance players.<br />
A lot of players on both sides probably have SotA blacklisted however, and since there are a lot more Horde pvping, it matters more what the Alliance players are blacklisting.<br />
This is how I think it is for EU atleast.</div></div><hr />
