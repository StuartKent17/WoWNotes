Mistweaver Monk Feedback -- Build 21249 -- 9-Mar<br />
Essence Font should be getting a maximum of 18 bolts per cast, even if you recast early. When testing it out on a single target, you may be able to see 7 heals instead of 6 when you chain two of them, but I believe in real multi-target use you'd still see 36 bolts in total (let us know if you observe differently on alpha). <br />
<br />
There is still no reason to channel it all the way because the waves of bolts aren't evenly spaced over the duration of the channel.<br />
Essence Font should attempt to fire 18 bolts evenly spaced over the course of 1 (non-extended) channel regardless of haste. It's probably hard to test on fewer than 6 targets since you won't see some of the bolts. Please post a bug if you see any different behavior from that on alpha.

Hello! can you tell me if druids' glyphs of Travel and Chamaleon will be avaliable in Legion in some way?<br />
Chameleon will be returning. Glyph of Travel is not currently planned to return, since glyphs are now cosmetic. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/705225190112784384))<br />
<br />
So Judgement can get to 100% uptime with haste, but enrage has to be demolished by haste? I'm a little confused. <br />
The haste breakpoints caused by fitting additional GCDs within that sort of short very powerful buff are (1/2) (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/705225388398497797))<br />
a significant issue. Judgment and Colossus Smash will be adjusted to solve this as well. (2/2) (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/705225433277603840))<br />

Hey, is bad luck protection built into Deepening Shadows at all? Wondering if there's a limit to the proc &quot;wait.&quot;<br />
It's a simple 5% chance per combo point, nothing further. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/705523549457375233))<br />

PvE<br />
The raiding scene is collapsing. Warcraft is dying. But don't worry, because we're honing in on pet battles!<br />
I understand the frustration, if you could focus on a few specifics, what do you want to see improved? What's broken? Why, IYO? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704930586918526976))<br />
make raiding a reward again for time and effort invested. You were at your peak when this was the case.<br />
This is a VERY good question. Can difficult raids exist in the modern world? Did it work for _____? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704961556803510276))<br />
For example, the expansion-ending raids last too long, that's totally true. But I feel that raid fights are solid in WOD (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704931179884105728))<br />
In before this shows up on MMO-C, ground floor. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704931337011142656))<br />
what about not longer but harder lvl, or Video how to fix the early game.<br />
Totally agree that more leveling challenges make for a more textured experience. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704938143187918848))<br />
I think the lvling in wow is actually wows biggest Problem (besides 1 year for 1 raid)<br />
Do people level often with their main now that boosts are a thing? I level alts, often in odd ways, eg archi (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704939240786944002))<br />
well I think alts should be more important for different playstyles and boosts dont feel statisfying (for me)<br />
Personally, I'm an alt-gamer. I like levelling alts in fun ways, did Rogue All PvP, Tank All Dungeon (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704940316378439680))<br />
Note to self: why isn't there an achievement for this. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704940421248643074))<br />
Talking about alts: why is there no achievement for getting ALL classes to max level?<br />
If you could get a toy for this achievement, what would it do? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704960623407288320))<br />
<br />
Was Timeless Isle too challenging? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704963191739011072))<br />
<br />
Pets and Pet Battles<br />
That said, I'd love to get some faction pride pets.Just not another scorpion for Horde. Tired of scorpions now.<br />
So like a boar? Or a wolf. Wolf-boar? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704953505459662848))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
so you said dungeons, world bossEs and pvp make an mmo. But it's more than that right?<br />
Not to be too undertale about it but people make an MMO. Free hugs. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704946491509579777))<br />
<br />
The players grew up, and so has the game. is still the 5000 lbs gorilla in the MMO room.<br />
every expac the game feels less like an mmo. What can you do to change this?<br />
What makes an MMO? Good question. What sparks MMO memories for you? Dungeons, World Bosses, PvP? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704942980105433089))<br />
random matchmade groups. The one thing I miss from Vanilla and BC wow was my server community<br />
.I don't disagree, I miss the old Tichondrius forums. Is this viable in the current climate? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704944266955657217))<br />
what do you mean the old forums? Like the old layout?<br />
.Nah like back in the day when people would post cascade memes during BWL progression @ckaleiki (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704945441880809475))<br />
did you play any older mmo, like Everquest or Ultima online?<br />
My first MMO was Dragonrealms, the text-based MUD (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704946645654495233))<br />
I spend 4+ hours leading community raids on normal because that's the only mmo feeling<br />
I remember this feeling from WOTLK Naxx, and then ICC/TOTC farming for solace (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704947137839276037))<br />

<br />
Why would it be the last x-pac? Even Everquest still gets expansions and the population of that is tiny compared to even NA/EU WoW.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying the state of the current game is great, but Legion being the last x-pac is just short sighted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even more fascinating that they don't own up to 20man Mythic being too high a price to pay for perfect tuning. Honestly though, if they can make the scaling tech for the dungeons work well and robustly; and be far more rewarding than doing LFR, they'll give themselves the doorway to phase LFR out of the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm curious, what do you think causes this 80% completion ratio? Is it because LFR provides great utilization of content and pleasant experience for the participants? Fair rewards compared to efforts and teamwork? Or maybe something else I'm missing?</div></div><hr />

This decomposition was brought about by several implementations, such as:<br />
<br />
- spliting raids into different difficulties (normal, heroic, mythic) and the resulting step-wise conversion of itemlevel and powerlevel.<br />
- LFR<br />
- cross-server raiding (and to a lesser degree cross-server pvp)<br />
<br />
Now please take note, that i am not saying that these options are completely bad for the game, in fact it might even have saved wow from dying a long time ago - well, we can never know what would have happened if... (you get it).<br />
<br />
So how are the above mentioned parts of the game involved in decomposing the player base?<br />
<br />
At the beginnig of ones raiding career, it is obvious to start with dungeons and then (if you have the gear), move on to the lowest difficulty level of raiding, which is the &quot;normal&quot; difficulty at the moment. Finding a raidgroup that is willing to accept a dungeon-equipped player as raidmember is not easy, since it is no effort for the raidgroup to just make an event in the raidfinder tool and pick from the applying players whichever is the most satisfying. The probability is very high, that the player you pick is not from your server, but from any other, assuming that applications to the raidfinder tool are independent of server (though, server population will be correlated if considering total number of applications per server).<br />
<br />
The Raidgroup selected only the best players available, so the content they are dealing with at the moment turns out to be not much of a challenge. Not quiet a cakewalk, but not the challenge that it should have been to be rewarding. But since there is still heroic an mythic, there is still danger to deal with. Of course, since heroic and normal are not locking out eachother, normal raid is farmed and heroic raid progressed simultaneously. again, gear solves problems on heroic that would otherwise have been challenging gameplay, but to be fair, it was allready harder than normal difficulty.<br />
<br />
now mythic raiding is waiting ahead. this is the real deal. the trial everyone longed for to prove themselves. but there is a problem.<br />
<br />
you don't have 20 people and some of the players in your raidgroup are'nt even on your server.<br />
people get bored of raiding heroic every week while trying to acquier players from your own server who have the gear to do mythic.<br />
the raidmembers from the other servers are frustrated cause they would have to transfer to stay part of the raidgroup, but their friends who are always around for casual BG fun are not willing to transfer as well.<br />
<br />
and on top of that all, your boss kills on normal and heroic are not feeling like an accomplishment anymore, since mythic raiders all over the place look down on heroic and normal raiders like &quot;thats not the real challenge, you just went easy mode!&quot;. players are leaving the raid for mythic guilds, others quit or are stuck with the ever repeating content of normal/heroic raiding.<br />
<br />
meanwhile, our dungeon geard wannabe raider tried gearing up in LFR and shot himself.<br />
<br />
The problem is, that if everyone plays with everyone from another server, where you can never engage in any world contet (or mythic), that is exactly what an mmo is not supposed to be and you can't cultivate any kind of communal spirit in this way.<br />
But WoW encourages this behaviour, in delivering no world content that can't be soloed and in unlocking mythic only through gateways which are much more easy to pass utilizing cross-realm gaming.<br />
<br />
this is also why many people get the feeling that wow is &quot;dying&quot;. because there is just not going on anything that anyone can witness. everyone sits in their garrison applying to a tool that matches you to people you don't know and can never meet without using the tool, while any of the capitals are turning into ghost towns, still governed by faction leaders not involved in the current storry line.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I totally agree, then there is the other huge problem with cross-servers that with what little world content there is to do like killing long spawn time rares of 15 minutes or more. You have people that are just using an addon to use the group finding tool to constantly switch servers to kill a certain rare over and over. I can't count how many times I have went to kill a rare and out of no where someone just appears and kills the rare then disappears to another server. I could do that but hell the only rares that feel rare anymore are the long spawn timer rares and now with cross server jumping you can kill the same rare multiple times in the time it takes one spawn which takes away from the feeling of it being rare.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think a lot of this can be shortened to skill matters less than gear in overall numbers of players. By that I mean to say: Without the gear, you can NOT do Mythic, Heroic, Normal, or even LFR.<br />
<br />
To elaborate more, this could be your 8'th alt and you know all the fights in and out. The limitation is primarily gear. I seriously doubt you're going to be taking an iLvl 680 Warlock into HFC Mythic.<br />
<br />
And this can even be shortened to: if you don't have the gear, you don't matter / can't contribute to the group. -- this concept runs against the concept of the original incarnation of MMO's.<br />
<br />
To add, gear is RNG. Grinding isn't even a guarantee and you're slowed on grind. If we needed me to get my ele shaman up so I can swap out my warlock to bring in someone else -- we can't until my shaman is geared enough to not bring the raid down. It could be weeks until we can swap out as you aren't taking an LFR geared class into Mythic.<br />
<br />
tl;dr: Gear matters *way* too much between difficulties.</div></div><hr />

It's not. Lathar is convinced by Garona that at least some of the orcs don't want them all dead- the<br />
Frostwolves. So the human leaders and Garona meet with Durotan and some of his men, they try<br />
to talking things out but are attacked by the Horde proper. Then the humans get their teeth kicked <br />
in for the rest of the movie and most of the Frostwolves get butchered.<br />
<br />
So no, everyone, it's not the only option- but it's the one that is chosen.</div></div><hr />

I think it'll do well enough financially as there is likely to be a strong following of people that will check it out no matter what. Whether it's any good or not is probably the real question.

<br />
at least the spellls got a facelift, but screw the model, 'eh?<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Feral\Guardian have model revamps\tweaks every frickin' expansion.<br />
<br />
They are new spell effects? They looked the same to me aside from regrowth now looking like original nourish</div></div><hr />

Fairly sure people said TBC would be the first and last expansion due to Shamans on the Alliance, Paladins on the Horde, belfs in the savage Horde, spacegoats and spaceships...<br />
<br />
WOTLK was gonna be the last because it dealt with Arthas, had rehashed content, DK's. <br />
<br />
Cata was gonna be the end because WOTLK was over, flying in EK and Kalimdor, the rework of the 1-58 world, LFR. <br />
<br />
MoP was gonna be the last because of Pandaren, Chinese theme, &quot;Lol new lore&quot; and shit like that, not to mention the CRZ. <br />
<br />
WoD was gonna be AMAZEBALLS because they'd &quot;finally move away from silly pandaland, go back to old and ESTABLISHED SAVAGE heroes&quot; but of course, people also said it'd be the last because &quot;When they start doing AU-shit, you know they're about to give up&quot;. <br />

What about Confession?<br />
What about Falling Avenger?<br />
<br />
Why does Blizzard hate fun so much :(<br />
<br />
Because you didn't pay attention to when they were converting them to skill books.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm honestly interested in your explanation for that statement.<br />
<br />
Right now the upper end of the raids are tuned for those .01% people and then subsequently have to get toned down to meet &quot;everyone else&quot;. The problem ends up being the upper end of the raid isn't that big a deal to the .01% but causes problems for &quot;everyone else&quot; (in particular for WoD Normal difficulty was across the board more difficult than it was supposed to be; the intention of it was to match the Flex difficulty of SoO, but it ended up rivaling &quot;Heroic&quot; in the rebalanced SoO).</div></div><hr />
