Legion - Kosumoth the Hungering Rare Spawn<br />
Arcten and other players figured out how to spawn (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/51itsz/kosumoth_the_hungering_theory/) how to summon Kosumoth the Hungering (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/111573-kosumoth-the-hungering)! Killing him won't do much for you unless you have the world quest, which is unlocked by completing the process below. This week the quest appears to reward Fathom Dweller (http://www.wowdb.com/items/138201-fathom-dweller) for EU and Hungering Claw (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140261-hungering-claw) for the US.<br />

http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/june/mvbar900.jpg<br />
<br />
<br />
Initial Steps<br />
<br />
Talk to Drak'thul (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/102695-drakthul) out on the Broken Shore (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/september/fdm01.jpg?1) until he has no more dialogue options for you to choose from.<br />
Head to the cave at 58, 54 on the Broken Isles, die and resurrect if needed to get past the rocks, go to the very back, click the Mound of Dirt to loot the Weathered Relic (http://www.wowdb.com/items/139783-weathered-relic). <br />
The mound is hard to see (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/september/fdm02.jpg), so look carefully. <br />
Return to Drak'thul and talk to him again until he has no more dialogue options for you to choose from. This requires opening and closing the dialogue window.<br />
<br />
<br />
Orb Notes<br />
<br />
Next you will need to click on ten different orbs, in order. Each has a 50 minute respawn time per realm. <br />
You can use this macro to check if you got credit for an orb: /dump IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(QuestID)<br />
The Quest ID for each orb is listed in parenthesis in the steps below.<br />
Orb 6 and 9 are bottlenecks, as they are located in a place where players from multiple realms appear. <br />
Changing zones, waiting, or logging in and out will cause the DANGER: Kosumoth the Hungering (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/43798-danger-kosumoth-the-hungering) quest to appear, rewarding you with Hungering Claw (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140261-hungering-claw) or Fathom Dweller (http://www.wowdb.com/items/138201-fathom-dweller), depending on what is up for your region this week.<br />
<br />
<br />
Orb Collection<br />
<br />
The orbs must be clicked in order.<br />
Orb 1 (43730) - Go to 37.9, 37.5 in Azsuna and enter the cave at the base of the tree (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/september/fdm03.jpg).<br />
Orb 2 (43731) - Go to 63.7, 36.2 in Suramar and take the path up the cliff (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/september/fdm05.jpg) right before reaching Stormheim. Turn right on the path, head up the cliff towards Stormheim, make a small drop off the rock to the tree on the side of the cliff. Enter the cave (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/september/fdm06.jpg) at 32.9, 75.8 and beware of the mob inside.<br />
Orb 3 (43732) - Go to Lorlathil in Val'sharah, take the road west to Thas'talah and head south towards the cliff, enter the cave at the base of the tree (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/september/fdm07.jpg) at 41, 81. The mob inside casts a high damage spell, beware!<br />
Orb 4 (43733) - Go to 31.3, 76.9 in the Broken Shore, swim down into the fatigue water (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/september/fdm08.jpg) and into the cave (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/september/fdm09.jpg). <br />
Orb 5 (43734) - Go to 59.3, 12.9 in Azsuna, entering the cave at the base of a tree (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/september/fdm11.jpg) in the purple rift on the map.<br />
Orb 6 (43735) - Go to 67, 15 on the Broken Isles map (near the island northeast of Stormheim), entering the cave located under the shark (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/september/fdm12.jpg). This orb will have people from multiple realms.<br />
Orb 7 (43736) - Go to 55.8, 38.6 in Highmountain. You will need to drop down off the cliff (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/september/fdm13.jpg) a short distance to reach this cave, which is another hidden by some bushes.<br />
Orb 8 (43737) - Go to 54.1, 26.3 in Azsuna, entering the cave at the base of a tree (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/september/fdm14.jpg). The orb is towards the back of the cave under a bush (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/september/fdm15.jpg).<br />
Orb 9 (43760) - Head to 79, 89.0 in Eye of Azshara and swim down to the sunken ship. Inside of it you will find a cave. This orb will have people from multiple realms.<br />
Orb 10 (43761) - Head back to where it all started, our good friend Drak'thul (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/102695-drakthul). The last orb is on his table (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/september/fdm16.jpg). <br />

<br />
Feel free to submit any Legion specific questions by posting in this forum thread (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20749125805#1) or via Twitter using the hashtag #LegionQA.<br />
<br />
We’re really looking forward to getting the chance to dive in and answer as much as we can, so we hope to see you Friday at 11 a.m. PT!<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 7.0.3 Hotfixes - September 6<br />
Classes<br />

<br />
(Hotfix in testing) Demon Hunter Sigils will now correctly activate if the Demon Hunter is crowd controlled after placing the Sigil.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/274-Priest) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/priest) / Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#U) / Artifact Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/artifact-calculator#VAAAAAAAA) / PvP Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/pvp-talent-calculator#U))<br />
<br />
The Discipline Priest artifact trait Sins of the Many (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/198074-sins-of-the-many?artifactRank=1) will now properly increase Atonement healing done.<br />
Spending artifact trait points as a Discipline Priest should no longer reduce the amount of Atonement healing done by Shadowfiend or Mindbender.<br />
<br />
<br />
Class Halls<br />
<br />
In Skyhold, Quartermaster Durnholf will pay more attention to players and not walk away from them so quickly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons<br />
<br />
Assault on Violet Hold<br />
<br />
Mindflayer Kaahrj's Faceless Tendril should now prefer targets that are not being targeted by Eternal Darkness.<br />

(Hotfix in testing) Brulfist Idol (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140336-brulfist-idol): Knockback height reduced significantly.<br />
<br />
Developers’ Notes: The two toys above (combined, or in conjunction with other things such as Emerald Winds (http://www.wowdb.com/items/139773-emerald-winds)) were too effective and diminished the value of utility and world-navigation tools that are core to certain classes and professions.<br />
<br />
Touch of the Void: the tentacles summoned by this trinket no longer scale past level 100.<br />
Reduced the active effect potency of Heirloom trinkets acquired from Warlords of Draenor Mythic Dungeons.<br />
Fixed a bug that could cause players, who were simultaneously both very lucky and very unlucky, to receive the same legendary item more than once.<br />
<br />
<br />
Missions<br />
<br />

Profession World Quests can now be completed in a raid group.<br />
<br />
<br />
Suramar<br />
<br />
Completing the quest &quot;Make Your Mark&quot; should now properly count progress towards the achievement &quot;Why Can't I Hold All This Mana?&quot;<br />
Players who have completed &quot;Jarl Come Back Now&quot; but are not Neutral with Jandvik Vrykul can return to Toryl in Jandvik to get their reputation reset.<br />

Legion Companion App FAQ<br />
With the release of the WoW Legion Companion App, we’ve seen a number of questions from the community that we’d like to address. Here are some answers to some of the most-frequently asked questions:<br />
<br />
Q: Why do I keep getting the same notifications when I close the app?<br />
A: This is a known issue, which we plan to fix in the next update to the Legion Companion App.<br />
<br />
Q: My authenticator app is on the same device as the WoW app, is there a way to avoid having to switch to the Authenticator app to approve a code while logging in?<br />
A: There are two ways to avoid this. When you get the “Check your Authenticator for request…” message, do one of the following:<br />
<br />
1) Swipe down on the notification itself to reveal an “Approve” button. Tap that and login will continue. 2) Scroll down and tap the “Use Authenticator Security Code” link. This should import a code automatically from the Authenticator app if it is on the same device. Then scroll down and tap “Submit” to enter the code.<br />
<br />
Q: I have a character that has champions, but the app says it doesn’t, and won’t let me log in. What’s going on?<br />
A: This is a known issue and a fix is being applied, but it may take a day to fully update world-wide. As a workaround, try logging in and out of the affected character on your computer before logging in on the app.<br />
<br />
Q: Why do I have to log in every time I use the app?<br />
A: You don’t! If you are on the title screen and have previously logged in, you should see the “Characters” button. Tap that instead of “Login” and you will bypass the login step and go straight to character selection.<br />
<br />
Q: Will the Legion Companion App be released for Windows or Amazon phones?<br />
A: We are currently not planning to support any platforms other than iOS and Android at this time.<br />
<br />

<br />
What if I told you that we're using these to bypass content we've already seen? Mind blowing right? Such a stupid reason to nerf them..<br />
<br />
&quot;..diminished the value of utility and world-navigation tools that are core to certain classes and professions.&quot;<br />
<br />
You mean demon hunter glide and the engineering glider you nerf'd? Oh and I guess the mountspeed increase item that costs 400g a pop? Lasts for 2 hours but falls off randomly? Or doesn't stack with Paladin or DK speed? Yeah, great. *slow clap*<br />
<br />
I know blizzard doesn't read these.. but damn! Irritating. <br />

<br />
It appears quests aren't being flagged correctly for some people. For example, I've attuned to the Stormheim one (43731) about three times now, but the IsQuestFlaggedCompleted check still returns 'false', and the Val'Sharah one I can't interact with.<br />
<br />
<br />

The items don't come from the boss, they come from the world quest to kill the boss.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The items don't come from the boss, they come from the world quest to kill the boss.<br />

He was talking about the orbs being able to be looted by multiple people.<br />

I am unable to click the first orb despite getting the skull and clearing all of the dialogue options. Oy. Monk just came in and got it in front of me, though.</div></div><hr />

Yeaaah. Either the orbs should be free to click and you should have to do it every week to access the WQ, or you should only have to have one person on the realm do the orbs and it unlocks the WQ server-wide until the boss has been killed.</div></div><hr />

Consider yourself lucky, at the first orb on my server, there are always 10+ people, plus many other that constantly come and go. This is very fucked up.</div></div><hr />

No, this is a lie, multiple people CAN NOT click it. Third time in a row that someone else has clicked at the same time as me, but barely faster only to get an invalid object and not get credit. It is a SINGLE use item and it despawns instantly.</div></div><hr />

So what you're saying is that Blizzard put in a Mount/Companion that NOT everyone can either throw gold at? You mean, some people who like a challenge have something to do? Holy crap guys, We must immediately complain about it, because this generation didn't cater to the entitled!<br />

In all seriousness: This is challenging, if it wasn't what would be so special about this mount? IT'S HARD, get over it.</div></div><hr />

There is hard and there is 100 people camping on an item that spawns (about) once an hour while regularly dying and having to run 3km for their corpse because there is no safespot from the geysirs.<br />
<br />
That is not hard, it is not fun, it is stupid and punishing. And imo the location being crz cannot be intended.<br />

Finding the caves was hard and fun (before having screenshots on the frontpage). Actually I was amazed how well hidden they were. Thinking about how to deal with the mobs guarding the 2nd and 3rd orb was hard and fun. This is not.</div></div><hr />

There isn't a safe spot for a reason, WHY people think that they can just AFK while right-clicking is their fault, not Blizzards. I am sure that the intent, was for people to fight for it. This hunger games. Everyone sits around the outside, and when it spawns, you run in and try to get it. Not like how people have made this.<br />
<br />
It's very fun, because it's like a race. MMO's have a part of them that is designed around competition. This is a form of it.<br />

The problem is these people get it, undermining the idea of your mentioned race and if Blizzard intended it to be that way and players just say &quot;Fuck it, I'll do it differently&quot; and succeed it is bad design. And CRZ makes it a hundred times worse.<br />

The &quot;want to watch the world burn&quot; players are the problem with the Kosumoth orbs; it's toy spamming and fel spreader spamming and whatever that awful thing is that makes everyone cry.

The waiting game, which blizzard loves to makes us play is sad and boring gameplay. I dislike waiting in one spot for something to spawn like Tlpd. Alani was a fun mount to farm because i was actually doing something. They should want me to be questing, or running bg's or dungeons not sitting at my desk watching netflix to distract me from boredom.</div></div><hr />

If you can even do that. I've spent 45 minutes staring at the screen hardly daring to blink because another camper was waiting together with me and I didn't know when the last guy clicked it.

This isn't a bad game design, it's just people DON'T want to do it! Think about it this way. Imagine if everything in this game could be acquired in a matter of 1 month, yet the game was out for 2 years. Do you think Blizzard would still make big games like this? Absolutely not!<br />

There needs to be features in this game that keeps people coming back. Either it be Professions, Rare Mounts, Raiding, Rehashed content. You name it, they'll do it. Don't blame the game or the game company for the reason you're either throwing money or gold at this game to keep it going.<br />

I think this is exactly why they removed it, The Demon Hunter class having a built-in kite effect is a benefit to playing that class, giving everyone access to a 2 min CD kite &quot;Cheapens&quot; it for DH players.</div></div><hr />

ALL orbs are ALWAYS there. When you can click on it you get a cogwheel, it lights up and you hear faint whispers and then it stops.</div></div><hr />

Not like how people have made this.<br />
<br />
It's very fun, because it's like a race. MMO's have a part of them that is designed around competition. This is a form of it.<br />

I agree fully that they have done a great job at hiding these. I would have NEVER found these without the guide.<br />

No need to start again, clicking the orb completes a quest. Once you clicked it that one is done. Use the macro to make sure you get each orb in order.</div></div><hr />

A few questions about the quests.<br />
<br />
Does doing the orbs out of order reset the quests? Or can you not click them out of order, and once youve done the quests, it's done.<br />
<br />
How do I get the mount if Ive already got the quest? Does having the final quest done just trigger World Quests, or do I have to do it again to get the other WQ? In that case, the quests would need to reset in that case right?<br />
<br />
If they reset, do I have a time limit to get this done, or can I do orbs 1-5 now, and 6-10 3 months from now?</div></div><hr />

When I went out exploring on my 102 toon, he emote/whispered a thing, I looked up the mob... went all the way to the Eye of Azshara (off Dalaran as an Orca) and there he was. <br />
<br />
I didn't attack him because he was a level 110 rare elite that would have eaten me. I just assumed he was a normal world boss and went on. Nothing said anything about all this mess to summon him, so I thought nothing of his presence. I took no Sceenshots. He was there though. <br />
<br />
Now I read all these crazy things to &quot;unlock&quot; him, but he wasn't locked? I am very confused!<br />
<br />
He's still there, but mount drop chance is 1/1000 (according to data from Rarity).<br />
<br />
BUT<br />
<br />
If you do whole thing with orbs you will get it with 100% chance. Not even from drop, but as reward from world quest. Confirmed, I was in group where was a guy who completed this madness. :P<br />

<br />
it is. 1st 5 orbs are fairly okay (had to wait only 4 hours in total yesterday) but the 6th orb is CRZ and litterally everyone is bottlenecking there, making corpses on the ground so people can't see the orb or placing toys for the same reason. then there are additionally aoe stuff on the ground which removes 90% of my hp (as dk 840 tank) if you get hit by it. not much fun. can't wait for the 9th orb which seems to be CRZ as well -,-</div></div><hr />

Seems to me that the geyser damage is not a flat number but percentage of your life. I took the same amount (relative to my healthpool) in Blood and Unholy. But when it hits the same spot two or three times in quick succession you are still fucked. Except healers. They just heal themselves up in two or three casts. -.-</div></div><hr />

<br />
The &quot;want to watch the world burn&quot; players are the problem with the Kosumoth orbs; it's toy spamming and fel spreader spamming and whatever that awful thing is that makes everyone cry. Any opportunity to grief, annoy, inflame, or otherwise troll others, these people will go for, and sadly this gives them that opportunity in spades.<br />
<br />
Exactly. I don't mind putting in the time, waiting for the orbs to respawn, corpserunning and all. But all the griefers out there make me wish WoW would be a single player game where you can decide if you invite people into your content via multiplayer or not.<br />
<br />
CRZ on top of all this is insulting at the least. There is a reason why I play on a medium pop RP-PvE server. I specifically selected this when moving my characters from a RP-PvP server, so I would not play on an overcrowded server with gankers and griefers. But now, Blizzard empowers these scumbags more and more, as if they want their playerbase to turn even worse than it is.<br />
<br />

This is far worse than every raremobcamping because you need to be prepared to die arbitrarily any second while a dozen (or more) others are trying their best to be milliseconds faster than you and one or two idiots always get off to ruining everyone's day by blocking the orb sitting in it or putting down cushions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have waited over 2 hours yesterday and over 2 hours today for the 6th orb. Missed out 6 spawns in total, because every damn time some jerk was standing right on the thing, or placed something to block the orb.<br />
<br />
People who block interactable objects or NPCs for more than 1 minute should be banned from the game for 1 hour. This would also solve the problem with people using giant mounts on traders and quest NPCs.</div></div><hr />

You can't do them out of order. Once the quest is done, it's done. <br />

Get the mount by waiting for the world quest to appear again. I doubt there is a time limit to get them done, but I don't know for sure.</div></div><hr />

1) Try realm hop and see if you find any you can click. Remember that the raid leader needs to be in the same zone as you.<br />
2) Try visiting the next orb in the chain. Maybe you accidentily clicked it.</div></div><hr />
