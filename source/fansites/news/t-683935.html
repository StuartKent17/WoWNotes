Blue posts<br />
&quot;Bring the player, not the class&quot;<br />
Needing to have a mix of melee and casters isn't a violation of &quot;Bring the player.&quot; Many of our encounters are designed to discourage you to stack the raid too far in one direction or the other.<br />
<br />
I realize for some players &quot;Bring the player&quot; means that their raid of 20 rogues and 5 DKs should be completely viable. That isn't our intent though.<br />
<br />
That mantra got launched because we didn't want raid leaders to have to sit good players in order to build an inflexible list of raid buffs and debuffs necessary to succeed. If you looked at a roster for Sunwell, nearly every raid looked pretty similar, maybe with 1 or 2 class differences. In Icecrown, the raid comps are enormously different. That doesn't mean class is irrelevant. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/21730677829-bring-the-player-not-the-class-fail.html))<br />
<br />
Dungeon System queue times<br />
The tool basis its estimates (and they're only estimates based on recent groups formed) on role. We're adding more smartiness to have it take a look at average wait by class too.<br />
<br />
It also needs to distinguish better between groups waiting to backfill (because someone bailed at the ready check part) and new players to the system.<br />
<br />
It's debatable whether some of these Dungeon Finder questions are appropriate for the role forums. We often lock or move threads on say the Arena matchmaking algorithm. I would say if you want to post about Dungeon Finder (or any feature really), try and make sure your post has a lot to do with classes, or else there is probably a better forum for you to use. It will still get read. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/21730688029-inaccurate-queue-times.html))<br />

Affliction and haste / corruption issues<br />
After discussing this issue, the solution we are leaning towards is to add Shadow Bolt to the list of spells that Everlasting Affliction allows to refresh Corruption. It's a fairly safe change (in terms of not breaking anything), more or less keeps Affliction using the same spells, but lets you invest in the Glyph of Quick Decay.<br />
<br />
This is not a promise. Until you see an announcement that this change is going live, understand that we may actually end up going a different way. I did want to let you know about what we're thinking though.<br />
<br />
I also wanted to thank everyone who contributed to this thread in a positive manner. It's almost unprecedented to see a thread go 26 pages and have 80 to 90% of the posts actually stick to the topic. While I'm not sure the thread needed to go quite this long, it's still a pretty nice feat for an Internet forum. I think these forums can only benefit from having more threads like this in the future. Hopefully they won't all require such harsh enforcement to keep in line.<br />
<br />
UPDATE: We are going to hotfix this soon, hopefully Dec 14 or 15. The tooltip may not mention Shadow Bolt as soon as the change goes in, because tooltips are harder to hotfix. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/21726255331-affliction-now-unplayable-after-hotfix.html))</div></div><hr />

Nice DK buff, it seems a good to change to balance them out. With the nerfs to their damage they're getting more into a utility role which is a cool niche.</div></div><hr />

More like intentionally to make people think that DKs got buffed to offset the huge nerf. From the news post and the comments it seems to have worked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did it really need nerfing already? It was hardly a challenge in the first place - so what if some guilds are having problems at the first hurdle? Do they need to be spoon fed content? Do they actually enjoy having a limited challenge ingame? <br />
<br />
I know normal modes are meant to be 'for the casuals to see content' but I myself am in a casual guild an have to admit at being VERY disapointed at being able to one shot each boss...we even made the effort to avoid PTR information and tactics...<br />
<br />
It felt like such an unepic climax to some interesting and diverse looking content - I really hope that other quarters, once they are opened, are much more of a challenge. <br />
<br />
Also for those who wish to know our gear level progress and such, we range from around 232-245HC - depending on the player. The Majority however are wearing the lower end of gear and currently run TOC 10 HC and ICC 10. <br />
<br />
Offtopic: I did enjoy Lady Deathbringer and the Gunship battle was a nice fresh unique experience .. though I can see its novelty wearing off. The Biggest disapoint had to be Saurfang, in which the fight seemed kind of a flat experience. <br />

It wasn't that the fight was too hard- it was that one bad saber lash hitting alongside a melee swing could two shot a tank with appropriate gear level due to the chaotic movement requirements of the fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are we playing the same game? Not trying to offend you, but we killed Marrowgar on the ... 7th try, I guess, with two 245-ish tanks around 50k HP buffed (Paladin and Warrior), still a pretty hard one, having wiped at 1 or 2 percent a few times. <br />
Lady Deathwhisper, however, died second try, first one was just baaaaaad timing. Pretty easy fight IMO.<br />
<br />
I like the fact that they lowered the damage, couldn't even imagine to survive heroic difficulty like this.</div></div><hr />

You must be kidding right? Lady Deathwhisper is problably the most interesting encounter so far, the mechanics of the fight are actually well thought out - it requires SOME coordination and intelligence, compared to most 'Get out of the fire/green,yellow,blue crap' <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skiball</div><div class="date">2009-12-15, 05:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizz backing off their &quot;take the player not the class&quot; is hilarious. Here is the problem with what they said about this not counting for ranged vs melee dps. I had a heated discussion with a friend of mine and healer about this. One day in raid we had FOUR melee dps, and he was saying we shouldn't even bother heroic beasts (this was the first week it was out) because we had &quot;too much melee.&quot; He was counting the TANKS as the melee, which is retarded. They are not melee. Four of the melee spots are taken by tanks, so effectively there are four less spots for melee dps because it seems many healers echo this sentiment, while there may be 10 ranged. 10 vs 4 or because of the mechanics they mentioned in their blue post. So much for player and not the class, your forcing groups to sit good melee dps in favor of a ranged because of fight mechanics that place the tanks in the same type (ranged or melee) of player as melee dps.<br />
<br />
The example they used in their blue about 20 rogues and 5 DKs is rediculous and an unfair criticism of thoe who want to bring players not class. No one is saying not to bring tanks or healers, that is not a contructive arguement. What &quot;bring the player, not the class&quot; means to me is that as long as you have one of the 4 tank classes, one of the 4 healers, and dps your good to go. For example, a raid with 3 druid tanks, 5 shaman healers, and all warrior dps, should be able to downthe encounter with the appropriate level of skill. You have tanks, healers, and dps. Blizzard's blue exmaple was dumb because it didn't contain tanks and healers. When you start subdividing one of those roles, in their example dps, your bringing class into it and not the player, therefor violating what they want.<br />
<br />
Anything byond Tank healer, or dps being the differences is gonna require sitting of players in favor of class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. Sorry, I've healed this fight. Did it in 25 man and 10 man, both VERY EASY, as long as you don't have massive lag. There's no excuse not have at least some 245 gear on your tanks before you go in there, you can get it from 5-mans now. This is currently a trivially easy boss in 10-man, easier than Koralon in VoA. This nerf will remove the only reason to bother bringing a 3rd healer to this instance (at least for the first 4 bosses), and place the instance firmly into ToC ezmode territory. Ohh wait....</div></div><hr />

since plenty of guilds got it done, but the how it got done presented some issues. <br />
<br />
In my opinion a 10 man should be 2 tanks, 2 heals, and 6 dps. That's just the way it should be.<br />
You shouldn't have to take 3 healers to a 10 man, yea sure you can drag the fights out and get it done that way,<br />
but you shouldn't have to. <br />
<br />
Now this fight can be 2 healed. We 2 healed the whole thing on 10 this week, but this fight imparticular really sucked.<br />
We pally/druid healed it and with as much melee damage as the tanks are taking, if the pally gets spiked you are kinda screwed.<br />

In my opinion a 10 man should be 2 tanks, 2 heals, and 6 dps. That's just the way it should be.<br />
You shouldn't have to take 3 healers to a 10 man, yea sure you can drag the fights out and get it done that way,<br />

Now this fight can be 2 healed. We 2 healed the whole thing on 10 this week, but this fight imparticular really sucked.<br />
We pally/druid healed it and with as much melee damage as the tanks are taking, if the pally gets spiked you are kinda screwed.<br />

It'll be interesting to see how much easier the fight is this week - we'll try it again with 2 and see. Part of the problem was having a DK tank in there (the whole evaporating DK tank problem) - so switching him out for a big spongy bear improved a lot too. As for nerfing it... *shrug*. It's just like what they did with kara... hell - by the time our guildies bother finishing their rounds of randoms most of the game will be trivial even for us.

<br />
<br />
Melee hits have 20% chance to hit me in ICC, so that would require some bad luck. Either way, a cleave and a melee hit hitting simultaneously will still leave me with upwards of 15k HP, meaning I might die if the healer's distracted, but rarely happens. That's what Ardent Defender's for.</div></div><hr />

Had a fair bit of trouble before finally downing it, but I'm sure it doesn't help that we've gotten RNG screwed in regards to tanking loot as well and our tanks have 2-3 pieces of pretty old loot.</div></div><hr />

what were your thoughts on damage output. <br />
<br />
<br />
Karazhan was always done with 3 healers. That's how it was supposed to be. It was too hard with the gear level you had to do it with only 2 healers. Only when we were overgeared and had more experience we did it with 2 healers.<br />
I really don't understand where you got the &quot;we shouldn't have to bring 3 healers to a 10 man raid&quot; from. If you go in with 2 healers and you wipe because your tank dies from &quot;too much damage&quot; (actually not enough heals) then you should play it safe and bring 3 healers. If you have problems with the enrage timer with 3 healers (which you shouldn't have) then you need to find better dps or find a tactic that works with 2 healers.<br />
<br />
p.s. I read you can position your MT healer in melee range of marrowgar so he doesn't get spiked.<br />
<br />
And also, you can progress from toc10 normal to icc10 normal. That's the normal path, which is doable. The higher ilvl gear just makes it easier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I call you out on this. It is certainly possible to one shot the first four bosses in IC. And it is certainly possible to down them without reading/watching the tactics first. But not both at the same time. So you are either lying or do not know what &quot;one shot&quot; really stands for.<br />
<br />
With respect to Marrowgar 10man, I can understand the nerf. It was not so much hard as annoying due to certain randomness a combination of saberlash and melee hit introduced into the fight. It is more about making the curve smoother than about making everything &quot;easy mode&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard knew that if they would keep up with Sunwell raids people would leave it cause its Hard....Too bad for us though people who are HC and work their ass to down bosses beeing mocked(Cause that's what i think posts like ur's are) by casuals..</div></div><hr />

Not trying to offend you, but we killed Marrowgar on the ... 7th try, I guess, with two 245-ish tanks around 50k HP buffed (Paladin and Warrior), still a pretty hard one, having wiped at 1 or 2 percent a few times.<br />
<br />
Did your tanks stack armor for this fight? Did they move together all the time? Were they near the boss when he finished whirl? Did your healers do the job? You don't need all 245 gear and 50k hp for this fight, it looks like something else was your problem ;)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hvidgaard</div><div class="date">2009-12-15, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a little ambivialent with the Marrowgar nerf. While it certainly seemed very spiky, my 10man healing team (Druid, Disc Priest, and me, Shaman) managed fairly okay. I'm 100% certain that RNG will go against us and wipe, but it was still very doable with some skill. However, I read right and left about 10man guild that couldn't do it, all while we (with an average gear level just below 232) 1-shot it without reading up on tactics.<br />
<br />
What made us successful, was definitly our tanks keeping an eye on their Combat log, and noticed the Saber Lash very quickly and getting the other tank in posistion. After every WW we blew a tank cooldown while the other tank got in. This fight is (or was) about utilizing everything your raid had at your disposal - stay out of the fire - switch target - stop dps after the WW. A lot of things that raiders are known to have a hard time at. I'm sure that trust in my fellow healers helped as well. Try to cross heal and someone will die. If our druid hadn't been able to handle the raid we would have wiped. If the priest and me had switched our attention from the tanks just 2 sec, they would probably die.<br />
<br />
Overall I enjoyed being challenged on my 2 weekly raidnights, and without the nerf, I'm sure Marrowgar would be trivial when the tanks geared up - but that doesn't matter anymore.</div></div><hr />

I don't have a problem with hard encounters, but this was just stupid for the first boss. I mean, with ilvl 230 gear you didn't depend on your skill, you depended on luck, that the tanks get him right and you are in range and not near a fire ...<br />

Would it kill you to farm for a bit of gold and buy your tanks some crafted/boe 245 gear? We did it on alts, me tanking on my paladin with an Ilvl 200 shield, and we got him down after a few goes. I must say I didnt think it needed a nerf and I didn't find myself taking too much damage. <br />

Classes setup in raids were fine in the whole historie of WoW...the only exuse you bring up for the last year is &quot;remember Sunwell shaman stacking?&quot;. It was 1 raid that had that problem, and even there you could clear everything without stacking a class if you played well enough.<br />
<br />
If you wan't to support your idea why all classes should be able to tank/heal/dps anything like it is now, you could atleast try to think of another reason than 1 raid where it was a problem. Also you base your fact tht class stacking was needed on the top 100 guilds ore wathever who were fighting to be number 1 clearing content...the 5000 other guilds who raided normal and took normal setup to raids are being held behind scenes right?<br />

Except you're supposed to have 2 healers on the tanks, and any healer should be able so manage until the 2nd tank healer is out. And tank cooldowns are there to be used you know, like after WW or at the pull. Anyway, it was hard, but at least I didn't find it that hard.</div></div><hr />

Hahahaha ermmm... no. <br />
<br />
Healer gets spiked =&gt; tank cooldowns / health pots are there for a reason.<br />
Even the most pro guilds get lag sometimes. But take your lag to Archimonde and see how you do. This doesn't fall into the category of &quot;luck&quot; after a while. After a while it's just Fail, and someone needs to fix their connection. Especially if it's a tank with lag, you need to fix that sooner rather than later.<br />
And the last is just FAIL. Seriously. A tank changing off is NOT luck.</div></div><hr />

'Farming' heroics will give you mostly 232 gear and maybe some higher stuff (non-set, but you want the set bonus at least).<br />

Now, I'll totally contradict myself and join in with the crying. Our casual guild rolled into ICC and our 45K tanks were slaughted like many others.

I understand people want to be challenged but you have heroic modes coming up for that so quit whinging. Basically you feel you are the pinnacle of WOW and therefore think nobody else should be allowed to match you. You came, you saw, and you conquered -- before the nerf -- and you have Heroic modes for the serious challenge coming up so get over yourselves. <br />

So because your guild couldn't do it, then noone can, right? I'll happily send you a WoL link, but that doesn't prove anything else than we 1-shot it, reseache or not, it wasn't that hard. I do believe it got nerfed because it's possible for it to be the weekly raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
honestly the reason we dont want it nerfed is because we dont want to have to wait 3 months to be challenged in hard mode,<br />
<br />
and to the people complaining did u stack 2 tanks or 3? his ability is spread out between people 5 yards from the tank, if you have 2 your right you may take to much damage, if u have 3 it may work out for you,<br />
<br />
those of you who cry nerf because i didnt read the fight, go shoot youself, it takes 5 mins to watch a video/read an artical on a boss fiight but your to lazy to even do that so you cry nerf i need epics, if you dont wana work for it stay out of raids<br />
<br />
<br />
the people who cry nerf are the mostly the ones who dont know there class, dont push more than 2 buttons a fight, refuse to move because they should be healed through blue fire, dont dps down bone spikes, and because there seems to be an overwhelming majority of people like this blizzard oblages there nerf crys</div></div><hr />

Nerf is justified and people who disagree are either blind or totaly overgeared whole instance. 10 mans are meant to be cleared by majority of playerbase. Damage was too spiky and too high. Gunship and Lady were walk in park compared to Marrowgar.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't outgear it as i'm in a 10 man guild only and i think the fight was fine, We 2 healed it with me and a holy priest took a few goes just to get used to the level of damage and popping CD's where appropriate, but i don't think this fight needed nerfing at all. <br />
Hell we even came back on alts and cleared the place tho we did use 3 healers the second time, but isn't that what dual spec is for?</div></div><hr />

and as a thing about faction champs. my guild has been working on heroic fac champs for like over a month and not downing it, we did however down it it last night, but over a month!, and you didnt see us crying nerf the fight all over the place and now that its down we feel good about our accomplishment, if it had been nerfed to hell i personally wouldnt feel like we achieved anything</div></div><hr />

<br />
But that's a problem with gating. Nerf it, don't nerf it, I'm not fussed either way, but you still have to wait 3 months for your hard modes. <br />
<br />
I think the fight is dead simple, like I say I think our guild basically failed big time. We had two tanks, and I also joined them to share the saber lash on a couple of tries, but still our tanks got tonked. I'm just a bit gutted that I'm not going to have the chance to try healing it myself before the nerf comes in, like I say I fairly sure our healers were pure cack, and tanks weren't doing it right. <br />
<br />
I agree a nerf has come way too soon, don't get me wrong, but if you polished off everything so far, the problem and your arguement is with gating, not the fact the encounter has been nerfed already, because you have it on farm already and easy beat it anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If people are honestly having problems healing it then its not the encounter that needs a nerf its your healers that need replacing. As for the next lot of nerfs my money is on them nerfing Lady Deathwhisper on 25 man - as someone said about its fairly simple but does require abit of thought and coordination (something casuals can't seem to do) so i'd put money on them increasing the add timers if anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know normal modes are meant to be 'for the casuals to see content' but I myself am in a casual guild an have to admit at being VERY disapointed at being able to one shot each boss...we even made the effort to avoid PTR information and tactics...<br />
<br />
It felt like such an unepic climax to some interesting and diverse looking content - I really hope that other quarters, once they are opened, are much more of a challenge. <br />
<br />
Also for those who wish to know our gear level progress and such, we range from around 232-245HC - depending on the player. The Majority however are wearing the lower end of gear and currently run TOC 10 HC and ICC 10. <br />
<br />
Offtopic: I did enjoy Lady Deathbringer and the Gunship battle was a nice fresh unique experience .. though I can see its novelty wearing off. The Biggest disapoint had to be Saurfang, in which the fight seemed kind of a flat experience. <br />

In SWP was about 3% of wow players - and that isnt what Blizzard want - to make a big nice raid with bosses what players will not see till next datadisk and beat that raid with 10 levels higher...<br />
<br />
There are quests, there lore and storyline... There are nice big raids and Blizz want that player will see them and have fun by fighting bosses there. Blizz create WoW for ppl. For HardCore players are Hard modes. There is no need of wipes for hardcore guilds in normal mode. They should play hard mode, m8 :-)</div></div><hr />

Lets turn the ragemeter down a little, maybe they screwed it up a little? If you can't do Marrowgar pre-nerf, you probably shouldn't be raiding.</div></div><hr />

It is certainly possible to one shot the first four bosses in IC. And it is certainly possible to down them without reading/watching the tactics first. But not both at the same time. So you are either lying or do not know what &quot;one shot&quot; really stands for.<br />
<br />
With respect to Marrowgar 10man, I can understand the nerf. It was not so much hard as annoying due to certain randomness a combination of saberlash and melee hit introduced into the fight. It is more about making the curve smoother than about making everything &quot;easy mode&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not interested in you 'calling me out' i'm not here to brag nor did I intend any comments I made to be taken literally but rather the point I was trying to make was that it really wasn't difficult (even for a normal), most of the mechanics have been seen time and time again throughout warcraft, the only difference is they have become steadily easier - however I cannot speak for 25man ICC. <br />
<br />
For those who are interested we were running with two healers - a resto druid and myseld a disc priest. both with a mix of 245H to 232 gear. <br />

<br />
I would argue against that. I'd understand if it was the first 10man boss of a level 80 raid but not the pinnacle point of the expansion where even the worst of players should be able to cope with some kind of challenge. <br />
<br />
Are people honestly satisfied with having very little challenge? The most frustrating thing is it could be months before seeing Heroics which I have no doubt will offer the challenge but shouldn't content that is so new still offer more of a challenge?</div></div><hr />

The fact that any decently skilled 10-man groups had any wipes at all makes him relatively harder than his 25-man version, where 10-man is supposed to be equal if not easier to 10-man geared players. He was by far the easiest boss in 25 (except maybe for the gunship), yet apparently not in 10.<br />
<br />
Hell, I ran with 10 people that are ToC/GC 25 geared and we still saw a tank die at the very end of the fight. Yes, he was quite defeatable prior to this change, but he simply didn't sync up with the bosses in the rest of the wing in terms of relative difficulty.</div></div><hr />

My guild has some awesome players, tanks and healers included but healing that fight was just wild. Overgeared (245) tanks getting destroyed before it was really even possible to heal them. We did have a weak healer with us but we had to have all 3 healers literally spamming the tanks to keep them alive during the main phase. Most people thinking that fight was easy would have to be DPS who just get to nuke everything, move out of the crap and call it a fight. We did beat the boss but from what I saw this would cause a lot of casual guilds problems which is not intended for the first boss of the raid I wouldn't think.<br />

If your having problems at that gear level then your doing it wrong. Even at the 10 man raid level you should consider your raid composition as that can easily change how hard this fight will be. http://www.worldoflogs.com/reports/y3a23voq88z3mbuz/details/3/?s=3566&amp;e=3851 Thats the damage amount a properly geared 245 tank will take, i dont see how that is unhealable in any fashion, our guild managed with two healers, a disc priest and a resto druid, a third healer just adds a buffer for the the spikes honestly.<br />
<br />
@boarder: the way those type of effects normally work is that they refresh the duration to max, however the time left on the current tic is the same. So if you had one second left on corruption when your shadowbolt hit, and refreshed the duration, there would still be only 1 second left before next tic occured.</div></div><hr />

This is a very tiny nerf, at best, to the Lord Marrowgar fight on 10-player difficulty. People who think otherwise has NO idea how the boss fight actually even works apparently.<br />
...<br />
...<br />
...<br />
On to the simple 4th-grade-level analysis that is beyond most people here. On average from these five kills of Marrowgar, the damage he dealt with melee attacks made up a whopping 11.04% of his overall damage. Assuming a huge reduction in melee damage (50%), this would take Marrowgar's overall damage down a whopping 5%. And note that this damage reduction would not affect the difficulty of healing really at all because remember, he doesn't melee for most of the fight, just after Bonestorm and right when you pull him. The only real effect this is has is giving healers a few seconds after a Bonestorm/pull to get on their feet again. There is no other effect.<br />
<br />
Please have some astronomically remote idea of how the fight works before posting how casuals win again. Thanks.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: These numbers also do not include damage from the Coldflame ability and are therefore skewed AGAINST my analysis. In reality the amount of damage that Marrowgar deals was nerfed by even less than 5%, probably around 2-3%.<br />
<br />
<br />
You do realize that when his melee damage is reduced, so is his Saber Lash, right? Saber Lash is 200% of his weapon damage. to quote yourself<br />

As for the nerf to Marrowgar I don't really care it'll be easier next week. Personally, I thought it was fine as it stood. Maybe we got lucky with the damage spikes, maybe we had the right composition, maybe we're just good in general :P, but when it comes down to it he's the first boss in the instance. He's hardly going to be the poster child for the level of difficulty for the rest of the dungeon. I shudder to think what he was hitting for in HM though if that's been nerfed too, given it seems very similar to Gormok except for all 3 tanks will essentially have the equivalent of the initial hit of an impale on them at the same time.</div></div><hr />

I would like to hear others thoughts, preferably other higher end raid healers, did you 2 heal or 3 heal on this fight last week, and<br />
what were your thoughts on damage output.<br />

<br />
Long time lurker, first time poster. I'm a guild leader of a casual 10-man only guild with about 8 players who are really hardcore players but wanted to be with their friends. We are solid as a playgroup. We play only 10-man, though we went back and farmed Naxx25 with another guild to do Ulduar10 (which was very poorly tuned when it came out).<br />
<br />
If you're complaining about the nerf to Marrowgar, I think odds are highly in my favor that you are a member of a 25-man raiding guild. If you're only geared through 10-man ToC and Triumph badge gear, Marrowgar simply hit too freakin' hard. It's just that simple.<br />
<br />
The whirlwind was a joke. The fire was a joke. The spikes were a joke. Tanks died to melee. Again and again.<br />
<br />
The first time we did Marrowgar, I went on my warrior. Main tank. Armory: http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Icecrown&amp;n=Vaerik<br />
I have sufficient gear I should be able to tank this. Nope, he hit too hard.<br />
<br />
The second time we did Marrowgar (because, no, despite everything we couldn't kill him on the first day), I went on my Holy priest. Armory: http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Icecrown&amp;n=Vox<br />
I have sufficient gear I should be able to heal this. Nope, he hit too hard.<br />
<br />
The fight was too hard for people who are geared entirely appropriately to be coming into Icecrown. And don't start talking about me being a &quot;bad.&quot; I'm not, and the raid group in my guild is not. I've played with &quot;bads&quot; many times. Ask folks who know me on Icecrown. They'll vouch for me.<br />
<br />
The boss just hit too hard.</div></div><hr />

You are aware that 245 gear is available for tokens which you get from 10 mans (and from the daily heroic)?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Someone doesn't really understand the meaning of &quot;casual.&quot;<br />
<br />
Here's a hint, a casual isn't likely to be so dedicated as to sit down and run the daily heroic every single day. If he has a decent guild he might get in a guaranteed 10 man every week, if he doesn't it's up to pugging, and with pugs your milage may vary. Some ToC 10 pugs could one shot their way through, others couldn't get faction champions. A casual player isn't going to have the time (or the patience) to deliberately farm a non-trivial amount of gold to buy 245 BoE gear. <br />
<br />
We got marrowgar in 10 man on the second try on our mains (who are almost universally 245 geared), but having played it as both a tank and a healer in 10 and a healer in 25, he does hit quite hard in 10 man. A 226/232 geared tank will have 40-45k health, maybe a bit more if they're pure stam stacking. <br />
<br />
In my mind one of the key measures of the difficulty of a fight was always the &quot;margin of error.&quot; That's the extent to which a person can fuck up and the raid still not wipe. Fights like Archimonde were tough because the individual margin of error was very low, one person fucking up and you were quite likely to wipe. An easy fight on the other hand, several people can fuck up and either not die, or if they do die, the fight can be finished. <br />
<br />
Marrowgar has a fairly low tolerance for fuck-ups. The tank isn't the closest target after bone storm - a dps goes down. The OT is a second behind coming out of Bone storm and the MT will catch a saber lash solo and get killed. A healer is out of range for 2-3 seconds after Bone storm or if a healer gets Spiked and both tanks can die if they're unlucky and catch a second lash. So in that sense it is a fairly low margin of error fight. <br />
<br />
I personally felt like it was tuned about right, the difficulty was right on par with Deathwhisper and Saurfang, but that may not be what blizz intended. It may very well be the case that blizzard intended him to be slightly easier than the other two. Gunship is obviously just a gimmick fight so I'm not really counting it.</div></div><hr />

But if you refresh a dot ever 3 seconds, u will get around 1 tick off correct? Doesn't make scene, maby im lost but i don't see how refreshing a dot that quickly will allow it to do any dmg. Enlighten me please :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go put a sticker on your head that says &quot;I didn't take time to get into how I'm supposed to tank in 3.3 or regem etc.etc.etc.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stop stacking stam... My ALT tank has less health than you, but I did read the patch notes, and regemmed parry/stam and dodge/stam, and am now sitting at 30.5% dodge and the same amount of parry as you. Had no problems taking hits from Marrowgar.<br />
<br />
Please go read about 3.3, tanking and you. The new raid is designed in such a way that you need more avoidance, EH (effective health) is NOT as interesting as it was on ToC because there are no severe damage spikes in ICC as there is on fx. Gormok.<br />
<br />
Picture this: you stam gem up and gain a wopping 1.5k hp (wauw!!!), at the same time you forget about dodge, and land at an embarresing 6% after raid debuff. Now, do you really think 1.5k hp is going to make a difference when you can't dodge a 13k hit?<br />
<br />
Or... could be you healers that are really slow learners. The trash part is a joke, I never went below 50% on me priest. Healing Marrowgar was challenging, but once you figured out how and when to heal there was no problem. Are you healers still spamming fast small heals??? Shame on them, tell them to use big heals instead.<br />
Also tell them to count how many people Marrowgar targets during Bone Storm. Once he hits the 4th target, they have to start healing the tanks, otherwise there's a big chance that it will land too late and both you and OT will die. If they don't know how to count his targets, show them the &quot;focus&quot; function so neatly build into the game.<br />
<br />
Good luck and happy kill next week after the nerf -.-<br />

I swear I will quit this game if people are still crying over these first 4 bosses after the nerf.</div></div><hr />

Yep... but that's the part that makes him fun, because you can't just walk over him without using your head just a little bit. Don't really know what to say about Bone Storm part. I mean, how hard is it to understand &quot;He drops aggro...&quot; Any dps with half a brain would say to himself that he probably shouldn't be doing any damage to the boss until he's sure tanks are in place again. And tanks should really be thinking to themselves that they probably don't need to run away in panic if Bone Storm comes close to them. I didn't get hit for more than 2-3k when playing tank.<br />
Never click away from boss and keep your mouse or finger over the ranged attack button or the charge button.<br />
Tanks can count targets on Marrowgar too with &quot;Focus&quot;.</div></div><hr />

since plenty of guilds got it done, but the how it got done presented some issues. <br />
<br />
In my opinion a 10 man should be 2 tanks, 2 heals, and 6 dps. That's just the way it should be.<br />
You shouldn't have to take 3 healers to a 10 man, yea sure you can drag the fights out and get it done that way,<br />
but you shouldn't have to. <br />
<br />
Now this fight can be 2 healed. We 2 healed the whole thing on 10 this week, but this fight imparticular really sucked.<br />
We pally/druid healed it and with as much melee damage as the tanks are taking, if the pally gets spiked you are kinda screwed.<br />
You can still do it if your geared out but by the end of that fight i was sweating bullets on the edge of my seat and well damn near out of mana even with a my cooldowns, a pot, and a innervate. <br />
<br />
With the gear lvl of my guild, the other healers and myself this should not have been as intense as it was, I can understand it <br />
needing to be nerfed for people in 232 gear.<br />
<br />
A 10 man guild should be able to progress without ever setting foot inside a 25 man for gear, and one reg 10 man to the next (reg 10 Toc - reg 10 ICC) should be compleatly possible.<br />

<br />
Since you're so schooled in the theorycrafting, you should also know that EH is, by far, the most effective stat to stack when learning an encounter. It is also, a very very good overall thing to maximize. Marrowgar happens to be a boss that (used to) favor avoidance, however, it's silly to completly regem just for that. Generally you switch trinkets and other pieces to increase your avoidance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand that stacking avoidance for Marrowgar is probably more helpful than the exclusive EH stacking that I have on my warrior. That's part of the reason I wound up on my Priest for the second evening of attempts. Your condescending attitude was somewhat offensive, but I'll ignore it.<br />
<br />
I also understand there's still some disagreement about the value of avoidance vs. effective health for multiple ICC bosses, and am waiting to read more research about the argument on Tankspot and EJ.<br />
<br />
Is there something else you see that's a problem in my setup? I was using my armor and avoidance trinkets. We made your suggested healing changes on the first night of attempts and saw a greater return on it. We also swapped to tanks who were more avoidance-geared the second evening, when I was healing. It was still ridiculously hard for the first boss.<br />
<br />
Shall I assume that you're 10-man geared on your tanks, then, Misazadia, and your frustration stems from others not being able to meet your accomplishments with the same level of gear as I've described?<br />

We were having problems keeping medium-geared tanks (In the 232/slightly higher) gear level up during the transitions on the fight (run in, post whirlwind) because the tanks weren't always in position for the first saber lash hit which would often KO a tank instantly due to healers not having having both of them topped up due to running away from WW/ running in to positions.<br />

I know normal modes are meant to be 'for the casuals to see content' but I myself am in a casual guild an have to admit at being VERY disapointed at being able to one shot each boss...we even made the effort to avoid PTR information and tactics...<br />
<br />
It felt like such an unepic climax to some interesting and diverse looking content - I really hope that other quarters, once they are opened, are much more of a challenge. <br />
<br />
Also for those who wish to know our gear level progress and such, we range from around 232-245HC - depending on the player. The Majority however are wearing the lower end of gear and currently run TOC 10 HC and ICC 10. <br />

You probably run with super geared ilvl 258 tanks, great for you. When you run with lesser geared tanks, you will notice that this fight is/was totally not in line with the other fights. First time in there with 3 healers, we had major issues keeping tanks alive. Wiped a whole bunch of times, finally killed him and went on to 2 shot the other bosses. Mainly due to not reading/watching all the available tactic information. So yeah, in order to keep the first boss in line with the rest of the place, this was either too hard or the rest is too easy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The nerf was not needed. Yes all guilds should be able to defeat the 10 man versions on normal difficulty. But it should still be a challenge. If you come here and say, right we have been perfectly posistioned after a WW and we dps spikes straight away yet still die with both tanks on top of each other fair enough. But ill just laugh at some excuses ive seen.<br />
<br />
&quot;If one tank charges and the other doesnt your screwed&quot;<br />
<br />
Im sorry but thats just fail. Dont let one charge...<br />
<br />
&quot;If tanks are not in posistion after WW you wipe&quot;<br />
<br />
Well Get in posistion early.<br />

The fight is completely doable by any guild who uses there time to read tactics, and execute a strategy. Should the fight be nerfed because people are just failing on mechanics? of course not. Yes the damage was high, but so what. Deal with it, its the last raid instance in this expansion. Even if it is 10 man. It still should be harder than any ToC boss 10 man.<br />
<br />
The nerf is just an outrage and anyone that supports it obviously wiped because of personal mistakes and wants there free loot. <br />
<br />
As for everyone else, and myself included here who gives a care in the world that they have nerfed him, yes its pathetic, but if a guild cannot down morra pre nerf. They will never clear the instance, so let them farm first quarter, theyll have no impact on any guild who uses there brains. And there is hard modes for us. Good luck in ICC 25 HC guys.</div></div><hr />

Plain and simple.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am with you on this. We are not a Leet hardcore guild, and usually get tired of the QQers about nerfs, but we Two-shotted it on 10 man in 10 man gear. If we could 2 shot it, serious raiding guilds could 1 shot it. I was the main tank this week (usually OT, but our MT was busy with RL) and only once was close to death.<br />
<br />
Hmmm not sure what the issue was, hope it wasn't because of the fight mechanic were 2 tanks had to be together for the lash, because that is part of the fight. When I ran to get the boss after the WW, the other tank had to be on my back, and know where I was pulling it.<br />
<br />
I am not really upset, just don't get it. Oh well we cleared all 4 like everyone else the first week, so nerfing doesn't matter anymore, as I know we beat it week one, even with many of the bugs in the instance</div></div><hr />

They need to remember that onces they get gear and learn and down the boss they become easier and easier. But no they bitch and moan until it gets nurfed. Then we they have the gear and all that good stuff the bosses is to easy.</div></div><hr />

For those new to the game, Morrowgar borrows heavily from Leotheras the Blind in SSC and saber lashing from Mother Sharaz (there may be earlier instances of these mechanics but they were the first to jump to my mind, feel free to correct me)<br />
<br />
Why I illustrate this point is that you have most likely seen these mechanics before. Mechanics such as managing threat (don't pull threat on illidan or he'll heal to half from the raid, only have the pallies heal on Tidewalker to get the murloc aggro after a tidal wave, wait for the MD once Hydross has passed the invisible line before you do anything), whirlwinding (hi leotheras, you jerk) has been used as often.<br />
<br />
The same solutions work in most situations. A good portion may or may not have raided in BC or prior, but old hands are quite adjusted to these fight ideas. Ask your old school raiders, and don't kick into deaden.<br />
<br />
The encounter didn't fit with the progression path. As someone said earlier in this flametrain, either the encounters post-morrowgar were too easy or morrowgar was too hard. The obvious and easier solution from a developers perspective is to re-tune one encounter and not three. That is just sensible changing.<br />
<br />
Ever since the massive retune of Ulduar in the initial weeks we haven't seen a similar story with further dungeons. The extrapolation from that data means that the designers are hitting closer to the mark of their expectations on the difficulty curve.<br />
<br />
Love it or hate it, this is the way it has been designed by the people who are paid to design encounters.<br />

10 man was a one shot, with our second 10 man group we put together at the weekend with whoever we could put together.<br />
We had 25 man gear alright but not heroic........clearing the 25 man version was perfectly in line with us and we found it bloody simple. <br />
In comparison the Lady Deathwhisper fight was tricky to learn and the Saurfang one tight in its requrements and margins for error. <br />
We did one-shot the airship on 25 and I had to go to work on the 10 man night on that stage.<br />
<br />
I really dont understand how people thought it was hard. Decent healers and dps who can stop dpsing to wait for tank? Thats about it really.</div></div><hr />

Yes and no. First, the original spinning boss was the 3rd boss of AQ40, Battleguard Sartura. Yes, Mother was first boss to do saber lash as far as i'm aware.<br />
<br />
But, both Leo and Sartura were CONSIDERABLY more difficult than this boss. Both could pretty much instantly kill clothies with their whirlwind. The thing is, that these old-school raiders can remember these sort of abilities at least being able to do damage to a raid, and if not handled properly, causing a wipe.<br />
<br />
This is the last instance in the expansion. This boss isn't too hard, it's the rest that are far, far too easy. Gunship especially is a loot box, while Deathwhisper is easier than Shade of Akarma, considered by many to be the EASIEST boss in BT. (it's easier because the adds do almost no damage). <br />
<br />
I can see Saurfang being a gear / dps check. That would've made a reasonable first boss.<br />
<br />
I think we can all agree that this does give them room to make hard modes harder. However, these aren't going to be unlocked for months. They should allow us to do the hard modes NOW, easy-mode stuff is going to get terribly boring.</div></div><hr />

Well the Only *Hard encounter* 10/25 is saurfaung and this needed just a bit of co-ordination once people got aware of what's going on with the blood...It suprised me they didn't nerfed him yet though i dont think they will anytime soon considering he drops tier marks in 25 man..</div></div><hr />

The fight was easier in 25 man because during P1 you only have tank damage (and during P2 a little raid damage instead). The tank damage was almost the same in 10 man and 25 man but you have 2 healers instead of 6. Do the calculation there and you see that 10 man version needed to be nerfed, not for the 25-man guilds but for the people only running 10-man like we do. <br />
<br />
Pre-nerf the tanks were hanging at 20% and we simply didnt have the healing POWER to keep them up, and as our shadowpriest had to go healing we didnt have replenishment and ran out of mana. Also a spiked healer meant wipe in 2 seconds. <br />
<br />
Post-nerf it was much more tuned to ilvl 232 geared raids which should be its target.<br />
<br />
Lady deathwisper seems to be a breeze compared to pre-nerf marrowgar.</div></div><hr />

For the record, I'm in a dedicated &quot;hardcore&quot; 10 man raiding guild (same lineup every week with all of our players taking specs that makes them as useful as possible) though we do attend pug 25 mans in our own time and we two healered it pre-nerf (resto druid and disco priest) with myself (warlock) and the hunter both capped (laugh at us poor australians) and disconnecting constantly.<br />
<br />
US-Frostmourne and Safetycount is my character name if you want to call me out.<br />
<br />
I understand what you're saying and I do agree with you that the fight seems much more tuned to that gear level now. As I said earlier, it was a case of tune down the first fight or toughen up the other three. There have been very few instances of bosses been made tougher and more than I can recall of them being tuned down. <br />
<br />
The thing that strikes me as odd is there isn't really a good reason not to be in reasonable ilevel 245 gear, plenty of 245 craftables and badge loot to be had, and surely a few pug toc 25s would yield a trophy or two (ours primarily came from totgc runs). Given that the icecrown heroics are dropping 232 gear, going a step above is a case of grabbing a few guild mates and hunkering down to a few ony / toc 25 pugs / totgc pugs (if your guild isn't capable) and your team should be flush with at least 245 gear, gdkp runs are also excellent in attaining some fairly high level gear (13k for my caster trinket... aww yeah).<br />
<br />
The reality is that it's a very reasonable connection that you can get to 80, run heroics and be kitted out in nearly full 232 / full t9 232 with bits of 245 gear in a few days of solid grinding or with a few weeks of here and there hours. The fact that you can bypass the naxx and ulduar tiers and content seems astounding to me. This means that the progression path is 80 -&gt; heroics -&gt; 10 man ICC. <br />
<br />
For that reason, it does seem odd that it has been nerfed to the level it has, I did the encounter tonight and none of our raiders were at all in fear of dying and we got the &quot;Boned&quot; achievement to boot. It hardly feels like a raid instance when it's a direct step up from heroics.<br />
<br />

We would have killed em if I didnt have to switch to tanking which meant no pally healer and a undergeared offtank.<br />
<br />
Having an undergeared offtank has been allowed since the start of WOTLK though, and it would be strange to change that in the first encounter of the new raid.</div></div><hr />
