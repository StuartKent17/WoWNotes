Patch 7.2 PTR Notes Update<br />
The Broken Shore<br />
Return to the front lines of the Burning Legion’s invasion in this new Scenario. Complete it to unlock a new questing hub with World Quests that make up a new Emissary and faction: Armies of Legionfall.<br />
<br />
Join in a new region-wide, cross-faction effort to construct buildings to fight against the Legion’s stronghold.<br />
<br />
New Dungeon: The Cathedral of Eternal Night<br />
The upper chambers of the Tomb of Sargeras were once a place of worship to Elune. Since the Legion's invasion, fel minions have desecrated this holy place, twisting it into their own image. Now, this site will host a battle that could turn the tide of the invasion. While the Armies of Legionfall engage the fel army directly, a small group of heroes infiltrates the upper reaches of the cathedral in a desperate hope to return the Aegis of Aggramar to its resting place. Inside this new dungeon, you’ll face:<br />
<br />
<br />
Agronox - This ancient served the night elves priestesses of the Temple of Elune, tending the beautiful Hanging Gardens. But after the malevolence of the Legion infected the Cathedral, the guardian absorbed fel energy through his roots. Now the twisted Agronox spreads corruption throughout the sanctuary he once protected, believing he has finally achieved his ideal state.<br />
Thrashbite the Scornful - Smashspite's detestable brother, Thrashbite has been dispatched to wipe out the mortals entering the cathedral's grand library. The dimwitted mo'arg lacks any respect for knowledge or learning, feeling petty satisfaction as he crashes through ancient artifacts and tramples priceless tomes.<br />
Domatrax - With the Aegis of Aggramar socketed back into its cradle, Domatrax leads an onslaught of demons to destroy the relic.<br />
Mephistroth - With the forces of Azeroth pushing against his front line, Mephistroth has fallen back to the Cathedral of Eternal Night, where he will employ all his cunning to ensure the heroes fail in securing the Aegis of Agrammar.<br />
<br />
<br />
Class Campaigns<br />
Every class continues its campaign to unify in the war effort. Your Class Hall is the base from which you will embark on a new quest chain, find a new potential Follower, and discover new class-specific World Quests.<br />
<br />
All new epic class mounts are now available! Complete the new class mount quests to obtain yours.<br />
<br />
Demon Assaults<br />
The Burning Legion is assaulting Azeroth with renewed determination. Look for Broken Isles zones to come under attack, fight to drive the Legion back, and defend the lands of your new allies.<br />
<br />
Pet Battle Dungeon<br />
Something nefarious is going on in the world of pet battles, and it’s up to you to look into it. If you have at least one level 25 battle pet, speak to Breanni in Dalaran to get directions to this new scenario.<br />
<br />
PvP Brawls<br />
A series of new twists on popular player-versus-player activities are on the way. Starting with &quot;Southshore vs. Tarren Mill&quot;, &quot;Gravity Lapse&quot;, and &quot;Warsong Scramble&quot;, PvP Brawls offer a variety of mode, rules, and scenic changes to the usual Battleground gameplay. Look for the Brawl option in the Group Finder (default hotkey: i) Player vs. Player tab, under the &lt;em&gt;Casual&lt;/em&gt; selection.<br />
<br />
Transmogrification Sets<br />
A new ‘Sets’ tab in the Appearances UI is where you’ll find this new way of tracking item sets from previous Raids, PvP Seasons, and more.<br />
<br />
Flying in the Broken Isles<br />
Take your final steps to complete the &lt;em&gt;Broken Isles Pathfinder, Part 2&lt;/em&gt; achievement to unlock flying in the Broken Isles.<br />
<br />
Class Combat Updates<br />
The launch of Legion included many updates to class animations, sounds, and spell effects. These will continue in Patch 7.2 with updates to Hunters, Death Knights, and Balance Druids. More are on the way!<br />
<br />
Legion Reputation Updates<br />
Reputation earned beyond Exalted will now contribute towards earning additional rewards from Broken Isles faction emissaries. These new reward caches have a rare chance to reward new faction mounts, such as the Highmountain Elderhorn, Wild Dreamrunner, and Leywoven Flying Carpet.<br />
<br />

<br />
Affliction<br />
<br />
Refreshing Reap Souls will no longer overwrite the current buff’s duration with a new one. The new duration will now be added to the existing duration, up to a maximum duration of 60 seconds.<br />
Reap Souls (Artifact ability) now has a 5 second cooldown.<br />
<br />
&lt;em&gt;Developers’ note: Previously, casting Reap Souls at 5 stacks (which would grant 25 seconds of the buff) with 20 seconds currently left on the buff would just overwrite your old 20 second buff with a 25 second buff. Now, in this case it will increase the buff duration to 45 seconds.&lt;/em&gt;<br />
<br />
Souls are now reset to 0 at the start of an encounter. The buff is also canceled at the start of an encounter.<br />
<br />
&lt;em&gt;Reason: Souls are a resource, and we have a rules about resetting your resources/stacks of a buff before an encounter, so that every attempt is standardized. Having souls the first time you fight a raid boss feels good, but it makes every other attempt after that feel worse by comparison.&lt;/em&gt;<br />

<br />
Necrotic Rot will now expire after leaving combat. Duration reduced to 9 seconds (was 10 seconds).<br />
<br />

In Patch 7.2, tab targeting should feel more natural. While in combat, you will no longer be able to accidentally tab to a target that is out of combat with you. Furthermore, you’re no longer able to tab to a target that neither your character nor your camera can see.<br />

I don't know about you lot, but I have 4 110s, all of them took fucking for ever to go from 795 ilvl to 810, then once at 810 breezed through to 825. The loot drop rates for me have been utter shit for normal dungeons and heroic seemingly over generous. <br />

Ugh, can't you just rework the trait? I don't play Outlaw but the many changes to Fatebringer are silly. You know, we're at 1 now. Lower than this and we are in fraction territory. At the end of the addon it'll read &quot;now has the chance to reduce the Energy cost of Finishing moves by 0.1 per point.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Now week with Bursting, Bolstering and Wound:<br />
<br />
Bolstering = Kill everything quickly at once while bringing them low first<br />
Bursting = but wait you have to wait 4 seconds before killing a mob otherwise your 10% health dmg stacks.. (rip speedruns)<br />
Wound = gotta stay above 90% health or you just die.<br />
<br />
Those 3 in one week would be instant &quot;We aint doing anything below 5 mythics&quot; with nerfed AP rewards it aint gonna be worth doing more than one for order hall chest. <br />
<br />
Back to &quot;One high level then forget it&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Souls are now reset to 0 at the start of an encounter. The buff is also canceled at the start of an encounter.<br />
<br />
Oh no, affli locks would have full souls on one pull on progression due trash. How terrifying. Also I hope this doesnt effect dungeons because.. yeah.</div></div><hr />

yes he did alot with wow, but overwatch in its complete concept, is his baby<br />
<br />
I didn't forget. I just feel like him writing the majority of lore for a game franchise that spawned 3 major RTS titles, an MMO that overshadowed all other games in the genre, a movie in which he cooperated as a script writer and numerous books is somewhat a bigger deal in his Blizzard career than &quot;Oh, don't forget he wrote a character profile for an ape from the moon and an Asian girl in a pink robot.&quot;</div></div><hr />

dont forget teir wont come out for another month or two after 7.2, so even with the teir being the same now as when 7.2 comes out, it could change, because again the raid wont come out till after<br />

Oh right, silly me.<br />
<br />
So the new sucky combo is probably<br />
<br />
Bursting, Volcanic, Wound. (ranged hell)<br />
or<br />
Bursting, Skittish, Wound. (melee hell)<br />
Etc.<br />
<br />
<br />

I know you love to argue just to argue but okey ... one last time.<br />
<br />
1. There are OTHER statue concepts. A person holding a hand with someone is not the only viable statue concept in the world.<br />
2. I understand he did Overwatch, my point is that OW is a small part of his otherwise immense Warcraft career, considering only the number of titles he held.<br />
3. I didn't notice the Alliance hoodie, no. What's that suppose to be, an ad for Blizz gear store?<br />
4. He was part of it, regardless of how big this part was. The point is not his part, the point is they MADE a movie based on a game he set the lore foundation for.</div></div><hr />

And for WoW, and for Starcraft. His influence is in every game they sell. But, it's just a statue, and the message behind the statue makes what it is, appropriate. They have his career indicated by the logos. Him and Winston's message is looking to the future, to the new. It's very personal. I like it.<br />

Because Winston is a baby, and Metzen is pointing to the future with him. It's not a hard message to grasp. It's a visualization of Metzen's philosophy and attitude, not his favorite character. It's about how he views his job. Winston just represents youth. It could have been baby Thrall, but that would have been kind of wierd.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What does being a baby have to do with it? I mean if you had to babify anyone it would have made MORE sense to do so to Thrall. You say that would look weird... the justifications for Winston is weird.<br />
<br />
The last project Walt Disney worked on was jungle book... in this tribute statue should he have been holding hands with a half-naked boy (Mowgli). No that isn't iconic Disney. Winston isn't iconic blizzard, its not iconic Metzen... it just the newest thing. Only time will tell if Overwatch has the staying power of some of their other Franchises.<br />
<br />
Originality... strike 1<br />
Comparing Metzen to Disney... strike 2<br />
Choice of iconic character... strike 3<br />
Wardrobe/flattering image of Metzen... strike 4 (chain wallet, cargo shorts... hey the 90s called)<br />
Accuracy... strike 5 (alliance shirt... really)<br />
<br />
The whole thing top to bottom is just a really poor example of what Blizzard is capable of. Worthy of an April Fools joke... maybe. Immortalized in a statue... probably not the best choice.</div></div><hr />

Metzen mained a human Paladin and he also voices Varian Wrynn.<br />

Edit: Baby Winston is there as a reference to the Recall animated short, which is about creating the world you want instead of accepting the world as it is. It's about optimism for the future and creativity and stuff.<br />

Source on the paladin?<br />
<br />
Varian or not... when you think of Metzen... you think of Thrall.<br />
<br />
In regards to Winston... awesome message... truly... its still not iconic of his work/time at blizzard, nor is it iconic of the company. It makes it seem like Winston/Overwatch is the culmination of some dream he's had his entire career.<br />
<br />
Metzen was also around during all of Starcraft... I don't see him and think Starcraft. I think Warcraft... I'm not even saying that holding &quot;Baby Thrall's&quot; hand would have been appropriate...as that would have STILL been a strike out for comparing him to disney, originality, wardrobe/flattering image.</div></div><hr />

I am sorry but I only remember that he was mentioning it here, I don't remember when exactly. But if I am correct, his main was human paladin and horde (didn't specify the race) druid.</div></div><hr />

1. Chris Metzen always wears clothing like that haha, yes including cargo shorts. <br />
2. CHRIS METZEN PLAYS ALLIANCE, if you don't know that and think he should have a horde shirt, you don't know enough about him to be complaining. He literally always wears alliance shirts and has the 3 times I've seen him at Blizzcon. &quot;But he voices thrall though&quot; yea so what? He also voices Varian and a plethora of other characters in the game. <br />
3. He was one of the main developers for Overwatch, which was one of Metzen's proudest accomplishments because he was also a lead of project Titan and the game itself was struggling to come into reality. When they decided to scrap it and brought Overwatch out from it, he was scared and depressed it wasn't going to do well. (this was all said in one of his resignation speeches, Blizzcon i believe?) So the baby Winston is a really nice tribute especially after the Overwatch short, &quot;Recall,&quot; with baby Winston in it. It's a perfect tribute to what he's been through and the hope the game has given him.<br />
<br />
It's a shame he's gone but the statue is a pretty perfect tribute to him. (although it could be bigger Xd)<br />
<br />
Edit: Apparantly people think it was comparing Metzen to Disney... Lol... No.<br />
