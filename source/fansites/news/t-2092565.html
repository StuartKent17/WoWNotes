Patch 7.0 - Hidden Secrets<br />
It looks like there are still hidden things in Patch 7.0 other than Artifact Appearances!<br />
Cant believe 7.1 is about to launch and no one has found the hidden... heh. Nm. Who's excited about the weekend??? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/787104748985921536))<br />
<br />
When they still havent found the 7.0 secrets and 7.1 is almost out... *sighs @ the ocean* (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/787115388685299712))<br />
Does whatever is still hidden have a notice at all? So we know if things are found or not?<br />
Not to spoil anything but yes just about everything about it has been datamined (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/787122169318772736))<br />
<br />
Its not in the ocean, the ocean is just a good thing to sigh wistfully at, you can stop looking in the ocean. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/787312606142795776))<br />
<br />
Outside of skins, ARE there some hidden things that players should be looking for?<br />
in 7.0? Actuallly... yes. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/787107433575354368))<br />

FEEDBACK: Trial of Valor (Normal)<br />
The Trial of Valor raid will be opening very shortly for testing, and will remain open over the weekend. Please use this thread to provide feedback, bug reports, and other relevant commentary. Links to logs are helpful, and please try to describe your group's overall organization and skill level (Mythic guild premade, pure PUG, etc.) to provide context for any tuning feedback.<br />

Patch 7.1 - Karazhan Attunement<br />
Attunement to Karazhan will require follower ilvl of 850.<br />
This is false, and based on misinterpreted datamining. The ilvl 850 follower mission associated with Karazhan is an &quot;Investigate&quot; mission, which gives you a quest for some bonus loot, exactly like the existing missions that send you into dungeons or into Emerald Nightmare.<br />
<br />
The attunement questline for Karazhan primarily involves Mythic dungeon content. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/775942-gating-content-behind-follower-missions/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17613702560?page=1#2))<br />
<br />
Patch 7.1 Arrives on October 25!<br />
Is Nighthold coming out in 7.1?<br />
7.1 contains mainly the Return to Karazhan Mythic Dungeon and the Trial of Valor raid. Nighthold is not part of this patch.<br />
<br />
Too soon, You have given us content too soon Executusornyx.<br />
I think you will find yourself pleasantly surprised by the span of content throughout Legion. We've already noted that Nighthold is slated for early 2017.

Will the Free For All, More For Me (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/11474-free-for-all-more-for-me) achievement be retroactive, or will we need to complete the world quests in 7.1?<br />
They will need to be completed in 7.1. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/786249711451672578))<br />

Pet Battles<br />
Now that that is over, what would it take you, random person, to get into pet battling? I'm talking sweet rewards here. AP? A new dog pet? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/785312742227972096))<br />
Something cool, like a storyline or something more of an upfront progression. Currently it seems like an afterthought system?<br />
completely agree that an overarching quest/storyline could be a lot of fun! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/785315315420762112))<br />

Environment<br />
Using your creativity and ability to work within the World of Warcraft art style, create a small environment diorama that would fit well in the game world. Your quest: Concept, model, and texture an environment piece that you could imagine stumbling upon during your travels across Kalimdor, the Eastern Kingdoms, Outland, Northrend, Pandaria or the Broken Isles.<br />
<br />
Required elements are trees, rocks, grass, and props, plus a small structure (such as a shrine).<br />
<br />
Your final piece should have a structure similar to the example provided below. We're looking for lower poly-count models (e.g.: around 1,500 polys for a mature sized tree), so keep that in mind when creating your environment.<br />
<br />
The final submission should be a high resolution JPEG file no larger than 5MB.<br />
<br />

<br />
Character Art<br />
Using your creativity and ability to work within the World of Warcraft art style, concept, model, and texture a non-player character (NPC) or creature that you could imagine roaming the plains of Durotar, exploring the depths of Deepholm, or just sitting in the Pig and Whistle Tavern knocking back a mug o’ Thistle Tea.<br />
<br />
Required elements are the character or creature, along with some sort of clothing or armor. Feel free to go further by adding weapons or other accessories.<br />
<br />
The final piece should have a structure similar to the example provided below. Stay within a budget of 6,000 polys with one 1024x1024 texture for the finished character.<br />
<br />
The final submission should be a high resolution JPEG file no larger than 5MB.<br />

<br />
Leaving the coast from High Mountain over by the friend murlocs. If you go out father than the kirin tor world quest, you'll notice there are a bunch of sunken ships with a long trench. The ships look to be viking style. They hint at a huge battle that was fought... and lost. Keep moving further away (from where they are facing), you'll come upon a sunken horde ship. The curious thing about this ship is, if you look around on the ground, there seems to be a line of starfish that head out. <br />
<br />
I moused over a lot of the area and found nothing clickable, but I have a feeling it all relates to something. Especially the sunken viking ships. I'll have to go back out and explore that area again today.</div></div><hr />

Uhm barely. Heart of the Aspects without the flashy bits and wings is just a cloud serpent which is where Cloud serpents come from, Skyterror is just a rylak which is a model used widely in WoD, Celestial Steed just uses the bone structure of Invincible and many more. So no store models are not unique at all. Maybe a few are and that's it. Hell the Grinning Reaver model comes right from the mobs in WoD which are built off the Qiraji models. Winged Guardian uses a Lion model from the guild vendors for crying out loud.</div></div><hr />

Heart of the Aspects doesn't use the same skeleton or animations as the cloud serpents, as an fyi. They're completely different models with different animations. :-)</div></div><hr />

Take the wings and shiny bits off and it is just a cloud serpent. It uses the exact same model and a similar animation. Technically it is the precursor to the cloud serpent mount.</div></div><hr />

I don't know if it's specifically a Hati bug or might be something to do with Bestial Wrath as I had my main pet despawn whilst it was still under the effects of BW and when it got resummoned it was still three times its normal size and slow and was stuck that way until I zoned out of the Broken Isles via hearthstone.</div></div><hr />

Using your creativity and ability to work within the World of Warcraft art style, create a small environment diorama that would fit well in the game world. Your quest: Concept, model, and texture an environment piece that you could imagine stumbling upon during your travels across Kalimdor, the Eastern Kingdoms, Outland, Northrend, Pandaria or the Broken Isles.&quot;<br />

LOL they didn't include Draenor :D:D</div></div><hr />

They tried to f*ck us with that follower crap and they had to change it to mythics (what we recommended to them). And this is how the playerbase try to slow down a self-destructive behavior company.<br />

I love these student contests. It shows how greedy Blizzard is. There is still an insane amount of potential in this game but the managers don't want to invest money into new art designers, script writers or voice acters. They just keep the burnt out left over...</div></div><hr />

I did the orb chain as well and i cannot believe a normal person has found all the places without any hint from the devs or investigating game files. If there is still a hidden secret and it is like the orb think, no one will be able to find by just playing the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Coordinates are 37,6<br />

There is an island off the coast of Azuna that is guarded by 110 Elite murlocs - they seem to hit pretty hard. A friend of mine and I decided to fight them to check out the small island.<br />
<br />
Here is what we found out (sorry, no screenies).<br />
<br />
The island itself consists of a wrecked ship on the majority of it. On one side of the island, they have a gutted fish with a lot of blood around it. In the water below, plenty of skeletons of fish (giant fish).<br />
There are 3 non-hostile NPCs in cages - A walrus-man (from Northrend). A penguin, and a murloc-related fish thing (sharp teeth and an antenna light thing attached to it's head).<br />
The penguin and murloc fish thing are green to me, the walrus-man is yellow.<br />
Heading up the path, you get to a giant pearl on a sea-shell with a giant murloc guarding it. Oddly enough, the giant murloc has the same amount of health as the others and shrinks when it dies.<br />
The pearl it seems to be guarding has a LOT of treasure around it. - None of it clickable, however, there are some very unique things about this treasure.<br />
<br />
It has an emblem at the front of it, when viewed correctly, it looks like one of the mantis race people from Pandaria. The treasure itself has a LOT of panda stuff around it. Brew barrels, bombs, even a panda statue. Also on the front of this treasure, I noticed a heart shaped gem next the the mantis emblem. <br />
So very out of place things on this island - northrend and pandaria.<br />
<br />
Also, if you die to the murlocs on this island - the GY is on the other side of the island itself...... So I'm guessing this island has a lot to do with something.</div></div><hr />

i too have seen this island just have never actually explored it, i swam around the entire continent of broken isles last night in orca form on my 100 druid. <br />
<br />
I found this giant what i assume is a night elf statue pointing out to this deep chasm near the little islands kind of under the DK base , found a cave with nothing in it, a cove with weird banners in it , of course the undead ship with the barrels of plague in them , a spot with a lot of sea horses and this spot even had a bunch of baby seahorse. <br />
<br />
This is a lot of fun even though i'll probably never figure it out but as a side not i did find this area with like these inactive deep sea murlocs in it that you can target but nothing else and there was a second toothless great white shark swimming in the middle of their area , i killed it just got a skin from it.</div></div><hr />

It is a filler raid. You will not be farming it for every gear piece. Just like RS.</div></div><hr />

So you'll believe the part where they sigh at the ocean, but then disregard the part where they say that it has nothing to do with the ocean? It all comes from the same person, why do you believe one statement but not the other?</div></div><hr />

<br />
He didn't say it has nothing to do with the ocean, he said it's not &quot;in&quot; the ocean. If it's anything like Kosumoth then that doesn't mean those Kraken don't have something to do with it.</div></div><hr />

If you don't like the free mount, then don't worry about trying to get it. They do not owe you a damn thing. There are other mounts in the game that you don't have yet, just work for one of them. 2 new mounts coming in Kara, new pvp mounts. New Archi mount. Pick one of them and don't worry about the Manasaber. As far as the hidden items, I like that you can't find it yet. Someone will figure it out and within a few days (after posting on here, or the forums) everyone will have it. Play the game, enjoy the game, when you find something unique it feels more special than just following someones instructions to get it.</div></div><hr />

The irony is strong with this one......<br />

Those student art work is really impressive. If we could only hope for playable characters as awesome as the Half-Ogre Dranei man that'd be awesome.</div></div><hr />
