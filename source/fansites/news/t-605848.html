Sunwell Plateau Lore<br />
For millennia the mystical pool of energy known as the Sunwell fueled the potent magic of the exiled high elves. The Sunwell's inexhaustible power permeated the elves and infused them with a constant supply of arcane energy. For generations the high elves protected and cherished the well, benefiting from its powers even when outside the borders of their homeland, Quel'Thalas. Although the elves sustained heavy losses in the Troll Wars and the Second War against the Horde, the Sunwell remained secure... until the coming of the Scourge. Without warning the death knight Arthas, a mighty servant of the Lich King, led his undead armies in a merciless attack upon the elven kingdom.<br />
<br />
Undeterred by the desperate struggles of the elven defenders, the Scourge marched on toward the Sunwell, slaughtering any who attempted to bar their path. The legendary king Anasterian Sunstrider faced off against Arthas in an attempt to slow the undead advance, but even his unyielding will and extraordinary powers proved insufficient against the merciless death knight. With the elven capital lying in ruin, Arthas marched triumphantly to the Sunwell and tossed the bones of the fallen necromancer Kel'Thuzad into the radiant beam of light. With this act the sacred well was instantly corrupted. Knowing he had sealed the fate of the high elves, Arthas departed with the newly resurrected Kel'Thuzad to carry on in service of the Lich King. Many of the Scourge, however, remained behind to prey upon the few elves who had not yet fallen.<br />
<br />
The ranger Lor'themar Theron organized the remaining survivors to fight the undead, but it was the return of Prince Kael'thas that brought the elves a fragment of renewed hope. Tragically Kael'thas soon learned that the greatest danger to his people was posed not by the Scourge, but by the Sunwell itself. The corrupted powers of the well still permeated not only the elves, but all that they had built. Given enough time, the vile necromantic energies would kill the elves and spread an incurable poison throughout the surrounding land. Kael'thas painfully concluded that the Sunwell, the heart of their society, must be destroyed.<br />
<br />
And so he executed a plan that would irrevocably change the fate of his people. With the aid of the most powerful remaining magi, accompanied by Lor'themar and a party of volunteer defenders, Kael'thas succeeded in destroying the mystical Sunwell. Or so he thought. The Sunwell's energies had been dispersed, and yet not all of its essence was lost. A mysterious individual named Borel gathered what remained of the energies and hid them away in the guise of a mortal girl, Anveena. In the aftermath of the Sunwell's destruction, Kael'thas declared that his people would be forever known as the sin'dorei, or blood elves, so they would never forget those who had fallen in defense of their homeland.<br />
<br />
Although the Sunwell's threat was ended, Kael'thas could not have foreseen the effect its loss would have on his people. The elves suffered terribly from withdrawal, for many of them had been infused with the arcane energies of the well all their lives. Only in the absence of the Sunwell did the blood elves come to realize how addicted they had grown to its powers. Over time the elves grew ill, and the youngest and oldest among them died. Determined to find a cure for his people's crippling addiction, Prince Kael'thas sought a renewed source of arcane power, and he soon fell into the service of the demon Illidan Stormrage. With Illidan's aid, the blood elves found a temporary reprieve, learning to siphon the magical energies of others to ease their own suffering. As Kael'thas joined the fight against Illidan's many enemies, the prince came to rely more and more on fel energy: the dark and corrupting essence wielded by the demonic Burning Legion itself.<br />
<br />
Now, bristling with newfound power, Kael'thas has turned his back on his former master, Illidan, and has finally returned to Quel'Thalas, promising final deliverance to his people. To this end he has harnessed the mortal possessor of the Sunwell's energies, Anveena. Yet many believe that the prince's exposure to fel energies has made him unstable, and that he has sought out a new master, a demon lord of the Burning Legion so terrible that even the mighty Illidan would tremble in fear at the sound of his name: Kil'jaeden. <br />

Arena Tier 0.5 sets update<br />
I didn't talk much about these sets during the last few weeks but they got changed at some point, they are &quot;beginner&quot; PvP sets buyable from reputation quartermasters if you reached a targeted reputation level with them. That's why this news is here, at the beginning of 2.4 testing a few of these items required you to be revered but all of them got changed to ... honored ! This isn't really new but I never took the time to talk about this change. See the new screenshots below.<br />

Because blizzard said they dont want to give tanking set by doing PvP. Aka, no PvE set via PvP (which is sad because prot warrior and prot paly could be very effective in PvP if they add a set with resilience and block value)</div></div><hr />

probably fairly cheap, given the cost of most epic armor pieces requiring exalted rep, i would say in the 25-40g range, but who knows they could charge more since the gear basically bypasses farming 50k honor or so to get your entire s1 or now s2 gear.</div></div><hr />

not that much. Check current armor items that those vendor sell and it will be the same.<br />
<br />
They added those to vendor to allow you to have decent gear to start to PvP. Because right now, you have to afk BG and 10 game arena because you basicaly have no chance if you dont have resilience.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
my original estimate in that post was 15-25g. however given the increase in daily quests and the amount of honor farming it will save you i assumed they would be a bit more expensive. but perhaps you are right we will see.</div></div><hr />

To any of the site administrators watching. This is the first place I come when searching for information on upcoming changes patches and any sort of strategy's. So great job this is an incredible utility. I do have one request at the moment though. The changes coming in the upcoming patch are strewn across 20 or so different posts. Everything from Badge cost per item to new rep items to new recipes. If you get a chance it would be a great asset to have with the patch coming the 25th according to what I've been reading to have it all in one place and not have to dig through the archives. <br />

I'll second this. With over a month of revisions it's kind of hard to get a full scope of what's been altered, and how. Tho, I suppose that would result in a pretty big post. Perhaps just links to the original posts that cover it.</div></div><hr />

Usefull - how ? By (Holy) Shield Blocking people to death ?</div></div><hr />

shield slam hits pretty damn hard with the right gear set and removes a buff. shield bash is annoying when it comes to silencing. aside from the fact that you are basically unkillable by melee. <br />
<br />
perhaps a reduction of spell reflect CD or taunt mechanics where when you have a target taunted all melee/spells coming from that target hit you while taunt is up. similar to intervene except it applies to the target directly. since this is how it works in pve already it wouldn't change anything there.<br />
<br />
perhaps prot would be viable then, at least for wars, or perhaps they would still be nothing more than a laughable annoyance. point being if blizzard wanted to do it they could. <br />
<br />
could you imagine taunt/shield bash rotation on a caster, basically locking them down while doing some damage and removing their buffs via slam. granted you are now vulnerable to fear completely but as a lockdown/defensive class in arenas it would be quite interesting.</div></div><hr />

Shield Slam hit hard<br />
<br />
Prot paly/war would be pretty much unkillable by melee and prot war would give an headache to casters.<br />
<br />
So in a 2v2, they would have to focus on your healer, if it is a druid, GG trying to catch him while the prot war/paly slowly but surely kill them.</div></div><hr />

That is definitely OP, but Taunt working similar to distract (which works in PvP) - forcing the target to the select whoever taunted it would be good. As Drysc wrote - Blizz wants all speccs to be viable, but some will be more viable that others. And it is fine. This way protection warriors and paladins would be a nuisance in the arenas, with an offensive dispell (warriors), stuns, interrupts, and &quot;target deselects&quot;. Some exeptional teams might even reach 2000+.</div></div><hr />

yea that i targeted is op, but it would make spell reflect far more viable. remember prot paladins would still not generate rage for shit. but stocking some rage and using something like a spell reflect / taunt to grab a mana burn and send it right back would be really cool. <br />
<br />
i've done some arenas as prot, it was somewhat fun in that i had a good mentality about it messing around. i didn't do real damage by any means, but i was a legitimate nuisance to the other team (tried it in 3s and 5s). i realize blizzard said they don't appreciate shadow priests or prot warriors or w/e in arenas, but it really wouldn't be hard for them to make some basic changes and introduce those specs. its sad that blizzard doesn't actually use the PTR to test some of these things :(</div></div><hr />

So to compete at WoW arena will cost you a nice sum of $15 * 12 + $20 * 52 / 6 = $353 per annum. <br />
<br />
That is lot of money to spend just to be allowed compete. Unless they plan on removing the requirement to have a normal account and just allow people to only be able to play on arena realms that is going to discourage a lot of players.</div></div><hr />

probably part of the reason its so expensive now is that they will use the earlier tournaments to fund the cost of setting it all up. i can't imagine everyone in the tournament being happy to pay that much, unless they are sponsored.</div></div><hr />
