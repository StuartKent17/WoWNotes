Warcraft Movie Box Office Numbers<br />
Warcraft has been released in many markets outside of the US and is doing well! <br />
<br />
<br />
Deadline (http://deadline.com/2016/05/warcraft-opening-weekend-international-box-office-1201763736/) is reporting that in 19 of the 20 markets it opened in, it was the #1 movie. <br />
<br />
In Germany, the movie had the biggest opening of the year so far, with 45% market share. <br />
In Russia, the movie had the second biggest opening, with 65% market share. <br />
<br />
Variety (http://variety.com/2016/film/news/box-office-warcraft-opens-international-1201784457/) is reporting that the Russian opening was only behind Deadpool this year, with the seventh biggest opening day of all time in Russia.<br />
In China (https://twitter.com/ChinaBoxOffice/status/735880884621049857), ticket pre-sales for the release night are already the sixth highest ranking movie of all time. <br />
Unfortunately the news isn't as great in the US, with an opening projection of only $25 million (http://variety.com/2016/film/news/box-office-warcraft-conjuring-now-you-see-me-1201783331/). <br />

Talent Changing Bug and Tome of the Tranquil Mind<br />
I would also like to point out that a Demon Hunter can't select a new talent while leveling without going back to town. Its like old school class trainers!!!<br />
This is a bug. You should always be able to select a talent if you have none currently chosen for a given row.<br />
<br />
In today's build, players may notice a new Inscription recipe for a single-player consumable, Tome of the Tranquil Mind (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/227043-tome-of-the-tranquil-mind), that can be consumed to allow an individual player to freely swap talents for a period of time. The materials needed to craft a Tome are vastly lower than those needed to craft the group-oriented Codex (formerly Wartome) of the Tranquil Mind (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/226248-codex-of-the-tranquil-mind), which remains as a solution for larger raid groups or guild banks that want to centralize the process, similar to the relationship between Feasts and individual food.

Legion Beta Disconnection Bug<br />
And this was suppose to be a build fix? It was better before this build.<br />
Yes, the build contains thousands of bug fixes. Unfortunately there is one new one that is causing the disconnects you guys are experiencing. We are working to have it resolved soon™ so you can stay in-game long enough to experience other new bugs and report them too!

Legion Minimum GCD<br />
This build does have a 750ms minimum GCD in all cases. This is something we're trying out provisionally to see how it works on beta.

Blood Death Knight Feedback -- Legion Beta Feedback<br />
The 20% healing was tested on alpha and it proved to be too low, why the hell change it back? So we have the most underwhelming active mitigation ever?<br />
The 'nerf' to Death Strike was mostly a misnomer. Bone Shield is an absorb now, so counts towards Death Strike. It also effectively stacks additively with self-healing from other sources, which there are much more of now, such as from the artifact.

Blizzard was between a rock and a hard place<br />
<br />
Water down the story = movie would be hollow and flop<br />
Put too much into it = fans would LOVE IT, but the rest wouldnt, could hurt future profits<br />
<br />
they had to go middle ground.<br />
<br />
The problem with middle ground is that neither side is fully happy, hence why so many people leave the theatres saying &quot;ye was cool, like to see goldshire and all these places..&quot; well.. is that good enough?</div></div><hr />

What's downright astonishing to me is that there are &quot;reviewers&quot; out there - many from big-name press - who haven't even seen the film, but still are condemning it based on nothing but stuff like reading the negative reviews from smaller blogsites run by people wholly unfamiliar with the franchise.</div></div><hr />

From what I'm reading, everyone outside of the US is happy with it. I don't understand why that's considered a failure. <br />

I wouldn't be shocked to see a couple Chinese actors in the second (and third) one, though. Hollywood's been trying to cater to Chinese audiences by including random Chinese actors even if it makes little sense. Transformers did it. Iron Man 3 did it. Others have done it. Star Wars is going to do it with Rogue One (although he may make more sense rather than just being there) and will likely do it with the later movies. Some of those scenes were cut in non-Chinese versions while others included the scenes. So I wouldn't be shocked to see them somehow manage to squeeze in a Chinese actor or two to appeal more to China for the sequels and pull in even more money from there regardless if it makes sense or not (and no, I'm not suggesting they just make them Pandaren).<br />
<br />
Find it rather insulting the movie didn't have a true worldwide release, though. Rather annoying that movies are opening up in countries other than the home country the film was created/made in first. If they want to open it in other countries, fine. Just make sure to open it in the home country on the same day. Opening the movie in the home country a week or more later just promotes people going to torrent websites and downloading it illegally. If the company who made the movie didn't care enough to release the movie in the home country on the very first &quot;world&quot; premiere date and instead delayed it a week or more, then many may think the company doesn't care enough for their money, either. It can make people feel unwanted or like they're being treated like second class customers. But Blizzard's been doing fantastic with that in WoD so no surprise Legendary would do the same with movie goers.<br />
<br />
I didn't have much intention of seeing the movie honestly, but I might go after all since I have nothing better to do. My theater does a $5.25 per ticket day on Tuesdays so if I went, it'd be then. I'm certainly not paying $6.50-7.25 a ticket to go see it otherwise. I don't do 3D or Imax. I have no interest in paying full price for anything Warcraft related right now after WoD. I don't care what it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe then they will think twice about balancing their attention and resource allocation, i.e. actually start having devs posting on non-U.S. official forums or maybe even having their next Blizzcon outside the U.S.</div></div><hr />

Nope. It matters how it does all over the world just the same as it matters how all the Marvel movies and any other movie does around the world.<br />

Warcraft will easily pull a profit with or without it performing well in the US. I wouldn't be shocked to see a couple Chinese actors in the second (and third) one, though. Hollywood's been trying to cater to Chinese audiences by including random Chinese actors even if it makes little sense. Transformers did it. Iron Man 3 did it. Others have done it. Star Wars is going to do it with Rogue One (although he may make more sense rather than just being there) and will likely do it with the later movies. Some of those scenes were cut in non-Chinese versions while others included the scenes. So I wouldn't be shocked to see them somehow manage to squeeze in a Chinese actor or two to appeal more to China for the sequels and pull in even more money from there regardless if it makes sense or not (and no, I'm not suggesting they just make them Pandaren).<br />

Legendary Pictures was acquired by China's Wanda Group in January of this year. Also, does the name Daniel Wu ring a bell? Hint: he plays Gul'dan in the movie.</div></div><hr />

...Not really. Biggest market is China. And if it does good in the rest of the world (wich it does, the movie is just awsome) it surely will in the US aswell</div></div><hr />

I don't think it'll do that well in the US but it doesn't matter. If it makes money worldwide, we'll hopefully get another. Take Pacific Rim for instance. This movie's performance will hopefully be that part 2.</div></div><hr />

IMDB users give it a 9/10, users who happen to be blind fans of Warcraft and wouldn't rate the movie any lower than an 8.5 even if it was a steaming pile. Critics, who happen to be far less biased, are saying it's an average movie which it more than likely is. There's no grand conspiracy to shit on popular movies, if there was then Star Wars, one of the biggest movies in the last decade, would have been steam rolled by critics, which it wasn't. Just accept the movie isn't as good as you think it is.</div></div><hr />

Personally I think both movies are simply affected by bias. Honestly Star Wars was an average movie too, but it was boosted by so much nostalgia and fan fare that critics &quot;had&quot; to rate it favorably. Similarly Warcraft's starting point is as a videogame movie, most were expecting it to suck. Were looking for it to suck. And while it may also be average too, it's probably getting slightly worse ratings than it should.</div></div><hr />

Russia. Watched the movie. As great as it was, i still feel stolen. More than 40th minutes of the film disappeared, and thats why you got so bad RT reward. <br />

I mean, where is the prologue at all? For simple people who don't roam MMO champ and wowpedia?</div></div><hr />

Yeah agree, its easy too see that legendary maybe got a bit too scared of a 3h movie and allot of things were cut out. Lets hope for the director's cut :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well that's the reason why I only trust in Nerdist reviews by now, most of the other movie reviewers don't know shit about superhero movies and often fail to grasp what is important in SciFi or Fantasy genres, for example. While I totally support the abysmal 10% rating for &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; at Rotten Tomatoes (because the movie was awful, the only thing about it was Jeremy Irons as the bad guy), I am sceptical about their other ratings. <br />
<br />
Anyway, I liked the movie even with some unintended comical elements there and some changes to the lore of the games (at least the ones I have recognised, I am not a major lore nerd). And the soundtrack is great!</div></div><hr />

The movie has already hit the torrent sites, and these clips aren't really spoiling much.</div></div><hr />

It isn't as good as the action/fantasy movies in IMDB top 100, but it is probably one of, if not the, best video game adaption I've seen and for a Warcraft-fan it's a must see. I've seen people who never touched the series before enjoy it too.

Helpful comment.<br />

Anyway I will see it on Sunday with a couple of friends. Surprised to see that it opened #1 in Pakistan, (where I live). There was no hype created here and I did not even know it was released already here. Many people here don't know about Warcraft, and those who are familiar barely remember the first 3 games (and to some extent, the DoTA mod).</div></div><hr />
