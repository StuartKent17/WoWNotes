Season 3 Delayed<br />
Postponed to November 27th. This also include new Vindicator honor items, season 1 items buyable with honor points, and of course the season 3 items themselves.<br />
<br />
Everyone is preparing for the start of the third arena season and we’re excited to get new items, rewards, and fresh competition going for everyone participating in the arenas.<br />
<br />
As we approach the previously announced start date we’ve had growing concerns of what the new season requires of us to actually launch, and its proximity to the Thanksgiving holiday. Everyone wants the launch go as smoothly as possible, and in order to have resources available to tend to any issues as soon as they may spring up, we’ve decided to delay the Season 3 start date to November 27. One week after the previously announced date.<br />
<br />
This allows us to have the quickest response time to any issues should they occur, and allows everyone to enjoy the holiday and the days leading up to it. While making everyone wait another week obviously isn’t the optimal outcome, in the end we decided it would be much worse to start Season 3 so close to the holiday and potentially make players wait longer until a problem can be resolved. Ultimately it allows us to provide the best possible service for everyone as we launch the new season.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Delaying a patch for two months and then having to have sub-patches to fix voice and sound problems is an &quot;epic amount of failure.&quot; A one-week delay on an arena season is not an epic amount of failure.<br />
<br />
Taking a week to make sure the start of the new season goes smoothly, and to make sure the developers are able to enjoy the Thanksgiving holiday is not asking a whole lot. It wasn't even pushed into December. Give them a break.</div></div><hr />

So now I'm capped at 75k honor with nothing to spend it on with 400 marks burning a hole in my bags and a great 4-day weekend coming up. *sigh* what's a guy to do?<br />
<br />
They should at least have done the following:<br />
<br />
made the Vindicator gear available in 2.3 patch. Reason: duh it's PVP reward gear. Why the wait?<br />
made the S1 gear available via honor/marks in 2.3 patch. Reason: who the heck is gonna by S1 gear 2 weeks before S3 starts and blow their arena points? Plus, they already got rid of the S1 gear vendor anyway.<br />
just have S2 available at current prices until S3 starts. They can change the price in the S3 patch. <br />
<br />
<br />
I just say this because for some of us finding oodles of play time to grind honor is difficult at best. The two weeks spent waiting for S3 could be spend grinding more honor in my new PVP gear in prep for S3. Instead now I sit and grind arena points in scrub gear and no reason in doing BG at this point.<br />
<br />
They should fix shammy earth shield while they are at it LAWL.<br />
<br />
Just saying...<br />
<br />
But yes they DO deserve a good holiday as do we all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, because every cent of our $15/month goes to the people developing and coding the game.<br />
<br />
You people are all selfish as shit. Give them a break, they're working hard. You act as if they're doing this on purpose, and as if they're the first people to ever miss a projected deadline. The official announcement said TENTATIVE dates, subject to change if something causes a delay. Guess what? Something caused a delay. Deal with it.<br />
<br />
Besides, this is Blizzard we're talking about, here. You can't tell me you were all foolish enough to think this would actually happen on time, can you? Seriously?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is a GOOD thing that they wanna delay to after the holidays before launch. It is not even about whether they deserve holidays or not. Public holidays must be given in office jobs by employers. It is part of the labor law. Obviously for people who don't work they won't know, won't they?<br />
<br />
If they don't care they could have just release it during thanksgiving and let it burn.<br />
<br />
The fact that they delay it so that the can have full staff to handle it shows committment and care that they have regarding their job and visions. <br />
<br />
Personally I am actually impressed by this development. Other games would not have bothered to move it to a more convenient date for them to support you WITH full staff. They are a proactive support bunch, not reactive. This is what real and mission critical IT support does, and generally doesn't happen in games. <br />
<br />
To the guys who says it is just items added. Dude do you know how many people complain about points and item bugs during season change? Hell I personally have sent in GM request with these issues before from changing last season to this season.<br />
<br />
Btw most of our cost of the $15 goes to support &amp; personal cost, NOT running servers and electricity. Utility cost is cheap compare to human costs. Thus I'm glad that I'm not paying $15 for half staffing at critical times of the game.</div></div><hr />

I for one had a huge amount of fun playing wow today. I logged on still specced Arms from doing my 10 arena fights yesterday, hopped into a quick AB and got an extra 400 honor and 25g for my efforts, came out, quick respec to prot so we could do a quick run to ZA before Karazhan, its a new guild, we are all fairly poorly geared and haven't even made a run at Gruul yet but we went to ZA just for fun. The instance looks great, the bear models are truly fantastic (I really want that mount). We got bear boss to 5% on our first attempt, then wiped twice more before we had to adjourn for Karazhan.<br />
<br />
The badges make a great change in Karazhan, it means that everybody gets some reward every time you kill a boss and certainly adds a better sense of achievement even for bosses you have seen downed lots of times before. We cleared front half of Kara in our 2 hours (we keep raids fairly short). After that was off to Heroic Ramparts. Ramparts proved to be an object lesson in the vagaries of pugging. At first the group looked great, 2 rogues both well geared, well geared mage, full epic resto shammie and prot warrior me, looked like an easy peasy run but after one of the rogues managed to wipe us twice the epic shammie quits the group in a huff, the rogue who wiped us goes at the same time and the search for replacements begins. About half an hour and 7 replacement group members later all 4 of the original members are gone and we have a new group, me, a cloth wearing holy paladin, a shadow priest with a couple of kara items, an enhancement shammie and a rogue, the rogue, shaman and paladin all bought their honored reputation keys just before we started. In short it looked like a disaster waiting to happen but turned out to be one of the fastest, cleanest ramparts runs I have ever seen. A group of players who despite not having the best of gear just have fun with their classes and know the subtle nuances of play, the rogue using blind to perfection, a shadow priest who knows exactly when and how to use mind control, an enhancement shaman who knows exactly when to chip in with a heal and a paladin who calmly keeps us all afloat. It is groups like this that keep me PUGging, yeah you occasionally get stuck with a bunch of morons (and as proven today, gear is no indicator of who is and isn't a moron) but sometimes you get groups that just shouldn't work but end up working to perfection all because the players don't take the game too seriously, play for fun instead of accomplishment and get genuine enjoyment out of doing the little things as well as they can.<br />
<br />
After collecting my 2 bonus badge of honor and an extra 25g for my efforts it was time to make my new engineering mount, I crafted the basic version and what can I say, it is a thing of beauty. The transition from flying to landed mode, the way it constantly stutters and pops even while you are landed, such a wonderful creation. Unfortunately they seem to have created a shortage of primal fire on the AH so I wasn't able to get it upgraded to epic yet but its just something else to look forward to.<br />
<br />
Lastly, it was off to do my daily quests and the last wonderful experience of the day, my prot warrior can actually grind fairly quickly and efficiently now thanks to the changes to devastate and whirlwind. Considering that both my dual wield weapons are fast daggers (1.5 and 1.8 speed) I can only expect it to get even better as I replace them with slower more suitable alternatives. In fact I suspect that with a couple of decent 2.6 speed weapons the damage would be decent enough for some BG PvP, I know I won't be doing top end damage but it will be decent enough to not be frustrating, plus of late I have been playing with the idea of turtling by equipping a shield and going into defensive stance when outnumbered at objectives and am finding it a fun and effective way of having an impact. In AB for example if you can stall people for even 5 or 10 seconds from a flag capture it can buy enough time for another round of graveyard respawns.<br />
<br />
In short, Blizzard have added a lot of fun improvements to the game this patch and I think that if so many of you can't get anything positive out of today and what it has done for the game then you must not really be enjoying your time playing WoW anymore and may need to take a step back and rethink your reasons for playing.</div></div><hr />

First of all, the patch has been tested on ptr exactly to know what to expect. Second, they dont do a real support job anyway. Third, lets not forget, this holliday is printed on the calendars since the beginning of the year so u cant say the holliday took them by surprise. They knew it was there.<br />
<br />
For me, the translation of the post is: OUR holliday is &gt; than the custommers. WE do not care that eu does not celebrate our holliday. They should gtfo coz we say so.<br />
<br />
For me personally, they failed at doing a proper job. The attitude is annoying. They will have fun with my money during that hollyday, thats what i find upsetting.<br />
<br />
A proper company would have made an announcement like this: &quot;Dear custommers we are happy to announce that we have made special efforts to ensure we will develop the patch before the holliday, so the ppls can enjoy it&quot;. Now thats an proper attitude. But blizz retards seems to have a attitude problem. Another bitter taste for me, and not much of an eating disponibility left here.<br />
<br />
I got 75k honor already coz was farming it a lot for this week. Also 4,5k arena points, so i will loose 500 arena points with this delay. Im loosing items which i could have farmed honor for in 2 weeks (and i can famr another 75k in 2 weeks) and im also loosing more than 500 arena points. Above all, i should be supposed to stay another boring 2 weeks on standby with nothing to do, just coz the blizz retards want to have fun?

Come on, some of us don't have holiday and these include the staff at Blizzard Europe in Paris. So I don't have holiday here in Germany, they don't have holiday there in France, so why can't we get the patch next week?<br />

Just once release the EU patch earlier than the US patch, let us suffer under all the expected trouble for a week of horror so that you can use this experience to spare your US customers the same trouble. <br />

1). they said that they will delay it untill after thanksgiving holyday. Thanksgiving is only a american festivity, not european also, so this makes me believe that only US will have it delayed<br />

Third, lets not forget, this holliday is printed on the calendars since the beginning of the year so u cant say the holliday took them by surprise. They knew it was there.<br />
<br />
For me, the translation of the post is: OUR holliday is &gt; than the custommers. WE do not care that eu does not celebrate our holliday. They should gtfo coz we say so.<br />
<br />
For me personally, they failed at doing a proper job. The attitude is annoying. They will have fun with my money during that hollyday, thats what i find upsetting.<br />
<br />
A proper company would have made an announcement like this: &quot;Dear custommers we are happy to announce that we have made special efforts to ensure we will develop the patch before the holliday, so the ppls can enjoy it&quot;. Now thats an proper attitude. But blizz retards seems to have a attitude problem. Another bitter taste for me, and not much of an eating disponibility left here.<br />
<br />
I got 75k honor already coz was farming it a lot for this week. Also 4,5k arena points, so i will loose 500 arena points with this delay. Im loosing items which i could have farmed honor for in 2 weeks (and i can famr another 75k in 2 weeks) and im also loosing more than 500 arena points. Above all, i should be supposed to stay another boring 2 weeks on standby with nothing to do, just coz the blizz retards want to have fun? Havent seen yet a more crappier, more retarded announcement tbfh.<br />
<br />
<br />
then quit, its an effing game. people get way too worked up about this. blizz obviously knows what they are doing since they have like 9 million subscribers. if your gonna bitch then quit the game, otherwise enjoy playing it and take it as it is</div></div><hr />

<br />
The do know Thanksgiving is there. However they may not necessary know how many people want to have a extended holiday by chaining them with weekends.<br />
<br />
It is easy for people to forsee other people's factor from a distance, that is because they don't know their actual circumstances and conditions.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You have to realize, just about everyone is tired of waiting, and so many people have full merc now. <br />
<br />
<br />
How does it matter how many people got what gear?<br />
<br />
If one is a good pvper, they will stand out regardless of how evenly geared everyone is.<br />
<br />
I think it is deliberate that they want everyone to start off relatively evenfooted, so that s3 is less dogged by the factor of gear overshadowing skill in arena. Otherwise the new guys who haven't entered the arena/pvp scene for long, will get discouraged by the shear gear difference, consider it unachievable, and leave game - which is bad business for Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Which is why at start of the BC expansion Blizzard giving 60+ quest items high enough stats to replace most but the best gears obtained during pre-expansion, so to give everyone a clean slate to start on.</div></div><hr />
