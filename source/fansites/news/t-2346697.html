Dungeon Delver - Maybe bonus xp in dungeons?<br />
Fireblood - 1% less damage from fire?<br />
Forged in Flames - smelt 50% faster! Though smelting seems to come and go / maybe something like immolation aura fire aoe?<br />
Mass Production - More ore from mining? Or what would be fun is chance to craft additional engineering parts 'not useable gear' but components used for other engineering things.<br />
Mole Machine - Some form of travel, I doubt a hearth, and going to the grim guzzler as a lvl 20 seems unlikely unless its to some racial place thats new.</div></div><hr />

Judging from the icons:<br />
Dungeon Delver - After years of being underground, you gain 10% Increased movement speed in Dungeons and Raids<br />
Fireblood - Taking damage has a chance to deal X Fire damage to the attacker<br />
Forged in Flames - Damage taken from Fire decreased by 1%<br />
Mass Production - When smeling Ore, has a chance to create additional Bars<br />
Mole Machine - Faster Hearthstone or secondary Hearthstone</div></div><hr />

The Highmountain ones look like amazing tank racials all around and the Lightforged list just looks like an unfocused mess. Explode when you die? Woo. If you play Priest, Mage, or BM/MM Hunter you're unlikely to even be within effective range for Final Verdict in a real fight. I'd rather have the default Dranaei's passive stat boost as a racial. I was most excited to be a Lightforged Warrior or Priest but I suspect I'd be much better off going with literally any other race.</div></div><hr />

Its like a direct &quot;suck it&quot; to Blood Elf players, bit annoyed I'll never be able to obtain that mount, and that BE racials might get nerfed as well.<br />

And isnt that Manasaber for the Nightborne exactly the same as the one everyone gets for free? Bit lost on the artistic direction here.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmocf4c913ee15</div><div class="date">2017-12-01, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok gonna give my 2 cents on the both elven racials..<br />
<br />
Let's start with Void elves<br />
<br />
Racials<br />
Chill of Night - Reduces Arcane and Shadow damage taken by 1%.<br />
Entropic Embrace - Your abilities have a chance to empower you with the essence of the Void.<br />
Ethereal Connection - Reduces the cost of Void Storage and Transmogrification by 50%.<br />
Preturnatural Calm - Your spell casts are not delayed by taking damage.<br />
Spatial Rift - Rip a rift in space and time. Reactivate this ability to teleport through the rift.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chill of Night&quot; is a nice passive that is in line with other racials! <br />
I suppose &quot;Entropic Embrace&quot; is the one that makes you change your appearance which is actually quite nice having a spectral/void'ish appearance suddenly in combat. <br />
Ethereal Connection - not much really anything to say about it other than it makes mogging much cheaper now!<br />
I think &quot;Preturnatural Calm&quot; is actually quite nice, especially for those who are pvp'ing.<br />
Spatial Rift is another fancy signature racial that seems to be quite handy<br />
<br />
And now let's take a look at the Nightborne <br />
<br />
Racials<br />
Ancient History - Inscription skill increased by 15.<br />
Arcane Affinity - Increases magical damage 1%.<br />
Cantrips - Conjure up an Eldritch Grimoire, allowing you mail access for 1.5 minutes.<br />
Dispel Illusions - Draw upon your arcane sight, piercing illusions and invisibility within 15 yards.<br />
Magical Resistance - Reduces magical damage taken by 1%.<br />
Masquerade - Shroud yourself in illusion, taking on the appearance of another Nightborne.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ancient History&quot; is the usual profession buff.<br />
&quot;Arcane Affinity&quot; this one is a nice dmg buff.<br />
&quot;Cantrips&quot; finally I can read my mails on the fly without having to learn engineering <br />
&quot;Dispel Illusions&quot; this will be quite interesting and I do wonder if it works exactly like the one the guards in Suramar use or not?! It is not mentioned here that it is a channeled ability, so I hope it is instant otherwise it will be quite difficult to catch mages, rogues and other stealthy folks in a pvp situation. This won't be of much use in PVE though!<br />
&quot;Magical Resistance&quot; makes sense and is also quite nice as a racial passive. <br />
I do not really like &quot;Masquerade&quot; as it only allows to appear as another nightborne which is not really great. I would have expected that you could appear as another race which would fit the theme more and actually would turn it into a tool of &quot;war&quot;.</div></div><hr />

It is, but on a very high CD. You'll get to use it three times on a boss, maybe four. It's not a high dps increase, and the damage is split inbetween targets. It's more on a 'get out of trouble' spell. I'd prefer the Nightbornes flat 1% spelldamage increase.</div></div><hr />

Ok, maybe right then. I still think its unlikely we will get them before 8.0 though - that does make them before BfA and not need 120 questlines - but only JUST before BfA.

They could just mean the Dark Irons and Zandalari. I wouldn't expect from Blizzard to tell us that the Allied races will be available earlier. They also quickly removed the achievements for completing the recruitment quests for the first four allied races. Maybe it's supposed to be a surprise.</div></div><hr />

Except we're not getting a plethora of iconic high elf/blood elf things with it. These blood elf copies still have night elf skin tones and the Magister's Terrace mount recolored with Anzu's colors. ;)<br />
Horde is outright getting this iconic look with both gear and mount. Gear that Alliance night elves have never actually been able to emulate.<br />
<br />
Overall, I'd rather have seen a few more Pandaren style neutral &quot;pick your side&quot; options with this whole ridiculousness. Especially after both factions helped the Nightborne.

Void Elves and Nightborne should've been neutral races choosing their factions. Both being uni-factional doesn't really make sense.<br />

Void Elves automatically go to Alliance because their leader is in love with a Human even though they were originally loyal to Silvermoon (as basic Sin'dorei). That's plain stupid.</div></div><hr />

Void Elves automatically go to Alliance because their leader is in love with a Human even though they were originally loyal to Silvermoon (as basic Sin'dorei). That's plain stupid.<br />
<br />
Void elves go to Alliance because they were banished from Silvermoon for corrupting the Sunwell with void and accidentally summoning the Shadowguard to Azeroth through a void rift. Alleria is exiled because her just being near the Sunwell tainted it.<br />
<br />
The Nightborne join the Horde because Liadrin and Lor'themar understand their plight, while Tyrande and the night elves treated them with condescension and suspicion. Also Thalyssra helps purify the Sunwell after Alleria accidentally corrupted it.</div></div><hr />

It's the armor that irks me more than the cat itself. Horde have had access to the NE mount model via Zul'Gurub along with other cats, so it's not exactly new or annoying to me.

<br />
Some may recall how the druid T19 (and its lookalikes) used to be a fancy shirt with cuffs and matching leggings to go with it. After 7.1.5, the lower bottom became permanently obscured by the robe skirt that wasn't there before. So much for trying to look like a nightborne rogue!

So for the Nightborne garb on human it looks majorly incomplete, but if you change it to Night Elf, you will see the entire complete armor with all its textures and &quot;missing parts&quot;. This is i assume simply because night elves and nightborne share the same skeleton and animations, and that the armor is specifically made for those skeletons. <br />

I wouldn't expect from Blizzard to tell us that the Allied races will be available earlier. They also quickly removed the achievements for completing the recruitment quests for the first four allied races. Maybe it's supposed to be a surprise.<br />
<br />
Of course, otherwise introducing Embassy in 7.3.5 makes 0 sense. They could achieve lot of things by introducing these 4 races in 7.3.5:<br />
<br />
- it's really strong incentive to pre-order and Blizzard loves (like every company) when we buy they stuff even before anyone try it,<br />
- without Allied Races levelling revamp is rather pointless - why should I experience old zones now? I will do it anyway to level my Nightborne in few months. And it would be wasted opportunity, scalling thing is great idea to fill content drought<br />
- these 4 races are heavy connected to Legion<br />
- Ion promised some narrative content after Antorus; introducing quests for races could serve as Legion epilogue at the same time<br />
- and now they even added Embassy, where all quest for races start<br />
- 4 races are pretty much finished at this point<br />
- we know for sure that we will get Zandalari in Zandalar and Dark Irons in Kul Tiras - they didn't reveal sources for remaining races.<br />

wat, Warlocks have the most uniqueness left of any class. No other class can conjure a healthstone to heal others, or make a summoning portal to summon members, or make a gateway to teleport people from point A to point B. Rogues for example, our number one defining ability, stealth, is shared with druids and huntards (to a lesser degree). Lockpick? Anyone can buy a JC/BS key to open them. Pickpocket is unique to us, as well as aoe stealth (which is on a 6 min cd and is almost useless compared to unique lock abilities). When have you ever heard &quot;gee I wish we had a rogue for their aoe stealth&quot; outside of niche M+ areas, compared to the universal &quot;I don't even care what ilvl he is, just get a warlock we need summons/healthstones/gateway&quot;. We don't have any warlock mains in our guild, and if we need to fill in a slot we ALWAYS grab a warlock regardless of the ilvl, because their utility is just so universally needed. Not to mention how faceroll good they are right now.<br />
<br />
As for pruning, who hasn't felt the burn? Rogues got roflmao stomped on key spells, hell, two of our specs don't even have access to poisons any more, outlul has neither a bleed OR poisons. Warlocks are in a GREAT position compared to other classes, their one of if not the best dps classes, preform unique utility that every group wants, and have retained more spells then other classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Holy Resistance is the worst kind of resistance unless something really changes in BfA and Light's Judgement looks kind of underwhelming, though obviously without knowing what the scaling looks like it's hard to be definitive... but Blizzard's track record with activated direct damage racials isn't great.<br />
<br />
Preternatural Calm is going to be pretty nice in PvP... if you're a mage, priest or warlock (or mistweaver I guess) while Warrior, Rogue, (non-MW)Monk and Hunter get nothing from it. Shadow + Arcane resistance is a lot stronger than holy resistance, but still nothing to write home about. Spatial Rift looks cool, but look at other mobility racials. Chances are it's going to have a short range, long cooldown or both. I'm actually kinda disappointed it's demonic circle and not blink, but whatever. Basically if you aren't a PvP oriented spellcaster you're left really hoping that Entropic Embrace has some cool damage buff component or the race is garbo. If you are a PvP focused spellcaster it's probably pretty good though. Not a fan of how narrow that focus is regardless.<br />
<br />
Nightborne also suffer from being too focused. Arcane Affinity only meaningfully effects three of the seven classes the class can play. Though I guess Rogue and Hunter might get some incidental benefit from various magical abiliites they have, that's still not very impressive. Magical Resistance blows the other two out of the water, but who actually cares about resistance talents anyways? I'd also argue Nightborne probably have the worst gimmick racials, but eh.<br />
<br />
So that basically leaves Highmountain, which are actually kind of good. Like every horde player should have a Highmountain alt with max mining and fishing so they can gather mats better than everyone else. Cool. In terms of actual combat 1% versatility isn't exactly anything to write home about, but it's still probably the best overall option here. Rugged Tenacity? Who knows. Kinda depends on what incoming damage looks like in 8.0... and whether it applies before or after damage reduction. <br />
<br />
<br />
All in all outside the gimmick racials I'm really not impressed and not sure why other people are either.</div></div><hr />

I did all the quests there. Their masquerade turns them into arcane images of all kinds of animals, and lifeforms I think there was even one appearing as an ogre. We also did get a toy that allows us to do the same thing! I believe the Nightborne magic is so sophisticated that they can appear as whoever they want to appear as and not just another Nightborne. That's why I think, their racial should reflect that even though it has no real use.</div></div><hr />

I also don't understand VE's going Alliance. I get Alerria, at first, but you would think at some point since being brought back she would have heard about the Alli betraying and turning their backs on the HE's. TWICE.

<br />
<br />
They really aren't though. Tauren get a flat +1% damage/healing done which is pretty consistent with what a number of current races get. Nightborne get +1% magic damage done which is comparable if you're a mage, warlock or shadow priest and strictly worse than basically every other race in the game if you're not.<br />
<br />
Light's Judgement, Rugged Tenacity and Entropic Embrace could be strong, but without any hard data on how they scale or interact with other features it's impossible to make a judgement call on them right now.<br />
<br />
The secondary racial features like faster mining or being able to blacksmith anywhere are pretty strong, but those aren't a thing top tier raiding guilds are really going to worry about either. <br />
<br />
<br />
I also don't understand VE's going Alliance.<br />
Well according to someone upthread VE lore is that they're incompetent buffoons who got kicked out of the Horde for nearly destroying the Sunwell or something. So there's that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eapoe</div><div class="date">2017-12-02, 09:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They really aren't though. Tauren get a flat +1% damage/healing done which is pretty consistent with what a number of current races get. Nightborne get +1% magic damage done which is comparable if you're a mage, warlock or shadow priest and strictly worse than basically every other race in the game if you're not.<br />
<br />
Light's Judgement, Rugged Tenacity and Entropic Embrace could be strong, but without any hard data on how they scale or interact with other features it's impossible to make a judgement call on them right now.<br />
<br />
The secondary racial features like faster mining or being able to blacksmith anywhere are pretty strong, but those aren't a thing top tier raiding guilds are really going to worry about either. <br />
<br />
<br />
Well according to someone upthread VE lore is that they're incompetent buffoons who got kicked out of the Horde for nearly destroying the Sunwell or something. So there's that.<br />
<br />
Which means according to lore, they shouldn't be an allied race to anyone and be their own separate faction.</div></div><hr />

Like whenever there's a Horde-only armor set you put it on a fucking Human. Put it on an Orc for once. Demon Hunter set? Oh we'll showcase it on a Human! What the fuck? And in this case, you can at least put the Highmountain set on a regular Tauren if you can't put it on a Highmountain, so at least we don't see it on a weird ass mustachio dude.<br />
<br />
ESPECIALLY in this case. The 3D armor doesn't show up on other races (LIKE THE TWO GIANT TOTEMS ON THE HIGHMOUNTAIN SET FOR EXAMPLE, OH THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT AT ALL). Guess what, it shows up on the appropriate race! Now you have fucking JPGs showing the race that will never get to wear it, with pieces missing, for what reason? It's not a good example of what it's going to look like. I can open up your model viewer and see how it should show up. Do people a fucking favor and take better god damn screenshots.<br />

These previews are incomplete and missing several parts.<br />

HUH I WONDER WHY, MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE A SCREENSHOT NOT ON A HUMAN FOR THESE RACE-SPECIFIC ARMOR THAT ARE NOT HUMAN</div></div><hr />

underrated comment right here, I have ALWAYS hated that mmo uses human as their default race, and this Right here is an example of how it doesnt work. Change the models to the races the set belong on and BOOM, art is complete.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I feel like we always end up shafted. I mean hell, our spell animations are still yet to be released.<br />
I just started leveling my warlock after having last touched him back in MoP and only now noticed how you guys even have to spec for demonic circle now, some elementary skill like haunt for affliction is now a talent choice in the first tier. What have they done oO.<br />

It makes sense for general class armor, since it's one of the most basic races that usually shows everything with the least amount of clipping/distortion. In case of racial armor though it's obviously pants-on-head retarded. Like the draenei boots obviously don't work out on a human (also wtf is with the assless chaps?!).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shadowpriest are slightly different. They still still deal with the light but are able to embrace the shadow without being consumed by it. Being infused with the void permanently is slightly different.<br />
It's the equivalent of a person praying to the satanic bible vs an actual demon walking around. <br />
Different analogy for fantasy elements: a Necromancer raising and controlling the undead vs an actual walking, eating Zombie.<br />
<br />
Before anyone adds &quot;...but demon hunters!&quot; Demon Hunters are a neutral race and an ally against the Legion. If the void/old gods become a major threat I could see the same for VE's as another neutral. The same as &quot;the enemy of my enemy is my ally.&quot;<br />
Let's also be honest, with everything that happened, DH's don't make sense as a playable race. I can see them being a neutral, non playable race. NPCs based around the world that pop up at major points, but with everything Illidan did, it makes no sense that suddenly people can accept him as a ready ally.</div></div><hr />

Masquerade sounds like a Toy effect. And Dispel Illusions looks like it won't work on stealth, and basically not useful in raids, so useless. <br />
<br />
Void Elves have really powerful racials. Imagine a warlock void elf having a blink (on top of circle if specced). Or Mages having triple blinks.</div></div><hr />

It's the Argent Squire (http://www.wowhead.com/item=44998)/Gruntling (http://www.wowhead.com/item=45022) for Alliance and Horde, respectively. But you'll need to buy an Argent Pony Bridle (http://www.wowhead.com/item=47541) for your squire/gruntling before you can use it to check your mail/bank/vendor.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VeraeliaBlack</div><div class="date">2017-12-04, 09:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol giving a Horde race to the Alliance (they're still Blood Elves), and an Alliance race to the Horde (Because Nightborne are still Night Elves). <br />
Won't be long and they'll be getting rid of factions entirely. This is just the preliminary step -.-.</div></div><hr />

Ridiculous story, followed up with some insane racials and an outstandingly cool Blood Elf mount. Its like a direct &quot;suck it&quot; to Blood Elf players, bit annoyed I'll never be able to obtain that mount, and that BE racials might get nerfed as well.<br />
<br />
And isnt that Manasaber for the Nightborne exactly the same as the one everyone gets for free? Bit lost on the artistic direction here.<br />
<br />
You may know this by now, but the mount gained by the allied races can be used by any character...</div></div><hr />
