Patch 4.1 on Live Servers this Week<br />
The patch is now available in weird places of the internet and we reached the point where we can pretty much confirm that the patch will be deployed on live realms this week. The &quot;pretty much&quot; is only here if an apocalypse happens and Blizzard has to postpone the patch (but it never happened). <br />
<br />
It's time for the super-giant recap of the patch features, with highlights on the most interesting stuff. Enjoy! <br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 4.1 Dungeon Call To Arms Interface/Mechanics<br />
The new Dungeon Call to Arms feature allows you to get extra rewards if you are one of the most needed role in the LFD dungeon system. If the screenshots below aren't enough, check out the official posts! <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 4.1 Dungeon Finder - Call to Arms (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2243-Patch-4.1-Preview-Dungeon-Finder-Call-to-Arms)<br />
Dungeon Finder Call to Arms - Clarification (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2245-Dungeon-Finder-Call-to-Arms-Clarification)<br />
<br />
<br />
The Call to Arms work as follow:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
When the Call To Arms is active for a role, a gold circle will appear around the icon and Satchel of Exotic Mysteries (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/69903/satchel-of-exotic-mysteries/) will be an extra reward.<br />
Satchel of Exotic Mysteries (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/69903/satchel-of-exotic-mysteries/) is the bag containing the extra reward with a low chance of mount/pet and will be bound on account. (See Dungeon Finder Call to Arms - Clarification (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2245-Dungeon-Finder-Call-to-Arms-Clarification))<br />
Call to Arms for more than one role can be active at a time.<br />
If everything seems balanced, there isn't any Call to Arms. <br />
<br />

New Valor Points and Daily Dungeons gains in Patch 4.1<br />
One of the fairly awesome change of this patch is the change to daily dungeon bonus rewards. You no longer have to run the daily dungeon every day to get your valor points, there is now a weekly cap of 7 dungeons that you can run at any time: You can run 7 dungeons on sunday and get all your valor points for the week! <br />
Right now, you receive 70 VP for the first random Cataclysm Heroic dungeon you complete each day. In 4.1, you'll receive 70 VP for the first seven random Cataclysm Heroic dungeons you complete each week. Similarly, you'll receive 140 VP for the first seven random Rise of the Zandalari Heroic dungeons (the new Zul'Aman and Zul'Gurub instances) you complete in the week, too. Collectively, you'll be able to earn up to 980 VP exclusively from Heroic dungeons, which in turn will count towards your weekly 1250 VP cap.<br />
<br />
By transitioning random Heroic dungeon rewards from a daily format to a weekly one, we'll be able to give players more control and flexibility over how they can earn VP -- which is cool! -- but this also means that we've a lot more bookkeeping to do in terms of where those points are coming from. To help with that, we're adding a &quot;Valor Point bar&quot; (similar to an XP bar) to the top of Dungeon Finder UI that will track your weekly cap, as well as how many Heroics you can still run for VP during the week.<br />
<br />
We're going to be writing up a pretty big blog about that system since it's somewhat complicated, but here's what you can take away right now:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In 4.1, running random Heroic dungeons for VP is now something you can do on your own schedule. Feel like spending your entire Saturday queuing up as random? No problem!<br />
<br />
<br />
The first seven random Rise of the Zandalari Heroics you run for the week will award 140 VP each. This is double the VP that you’ll receive from your first seven random &quot;tier 1&quot; Cataclysm Heroics, since the dungeons are considered a &quot;step up&quot; in difficulty.<br />
<br />
<br />
You'll be able to randomly queue for the Rise of the Zandalari Heroics separately from the tier 1 Cataclysm Heroic dungeons.<br />
<br />
<br />
Each week you can earn up to 980 VP just by running random Heroic dungeons. If you want to maximize your VP gains, you can still reach the overall weekly cap of 1250 by defeating raid level content.<br />
<br />
<br />
This isn't yet on the PTR for testing. We'll let you know when it is, though, and will continue to provide more information as the development of 4.1 progresses.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
New Dungeons - Zul'aman and Zul'gurb (Heroic 5-Man)<br />
Zul'aman and Zul'Gurub are back as heroic-only dungeons! You can check out the video previews from OMFGCata (http://www.youtube.com/user/OMFGcata) and the Yogscast (http://www.youtube.com/user/BlueXephos), the official preview from the link below, and the loot list (with screenshots)! <br />

Heirloom Tanking Items introduced in Patch 4.1<br />
A new set of tanking heirloom has been added in this patch, this set is available from your regular sources of heirlooms (vendors, guild rewards, etc ...). I also included the legs part of this set but it is not available in game yet. <br />
<br />

Maelstrom Crystals and Honor/Justice conversion in Patch 4.1<br />
In this patch you can buy Maelstrom Crystal (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52722/maelstrom-crystal/) from your honor and justice reward vendors. You can also convert your Honor Points into Justice Points and vice versa. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Patch 4.1: Guild Challenges<br />
In addition to updating Zul’Gurub and Zul’Aman for level-85 players, we're also excited about another patch 4.1 feature: Guild Challenges. Built into the Info panel of the guild user interface, Guild Challenges will be weekly tasks guild groups can tackle for additional guild experience, achievements, and gold.<br />
<br />
This feature has been designed and implemented to be quite simple. At the top of the guild user interface Info pane, a new Guild Challenges section will be displayed and broken into three categories: Dungeons, Raids, and Rated Battlegrounds. Any guild group will qualify for Guild Challenges credit and there is a set number of times each challenge can be completed per week. There’s no need to add a quest to your Quest Log or anything of that nature. Just grab a guild group eligible for any of the challenges and go.<br />
<br />
Completing a Guild Challenge will result in a popup to confirm credit has been awarded, similar to achievement popups (or “toasts”). The participating guild members will then earn experience for their guild. In addition, a gold reward will be deposited directly to the Guild Vault. The gold and experience rewarded varies for each challenge type, but you won’t have to worry about receiving reduced rewards if, say, you happen to be in a guild group that completes a raid or dungeon on normal difficulty. Since there is a limited number of times each challenge type can be completed per week, we want to make sure guilds don’t feel set back if a guild group of level-18 players receives credit for completing Deadmines, versus a level-85 guild group completing Heroic Deadmines. The same applies to normal and Heroic difficulty raid progression. Provided the content is level-appropriate for your guild group, you’ll earn experience and gold for your guild.<br />
<br />
To earn Guild Dungeon Challenge credit, the 5-player party must be composed of at least 3 guild members. Raid and Rated Battleground Challenges require that 8 out of 10 players be guild members, while 20 guild members are required to earn credit for 25-player raids. To earn gold for Guild Challenge rewards, a guild must be level 5 or higher and the participating members must have earned honored reputation with the guild. For example, 3 out of 5 guild members in a 5-player party must be honored to earn gold for the guild. If those three guild members have only reached friendly reputation, they would still receive credit and earn guild experience, but the guild would not receive gold.<br />
<br />
So, let’s say your guild has been regularly hitting the daily experience cap. You might be wondering how beneficial it’d be to do Guild Challenges. Well wonder no more, amigos: Guild Challenges award guild experience above the cap. Think of it like rested experience. The guild experience cap will extend itself relative to the guild experience earned by completing these challenges. It’s a great way to get an extra edge on your guild leveling! Not only that, if your guild reaches the level cap, continuing to partake in Guild Challenges will yield a much more substantial sum of gold deposited directly into the Guild Vault.<br />
<br />
We’re very happy with Guild Challenges and feel that they’re a fun way to continue expanding upon all of the new guild features added in World of Warcraft: Cataclysm. Your feedback regarding this system is always appreciated, as you can be sure we’ll be looking for ways to beef it up in future patches.<br />

Target position on Minimap in Patch 4.1<br />
Patch 4.1 adds a very useful feature to the game, anything you target will now have its position displayed on the minimap! It's obviously very useful when you're looking for a NPC after using the /target command and I'm sure it will make a couple of rare elite hunters happy. (Unless you have NPCScan (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/npcscan.aspx), in this case you're probably already happy)<br />

Patch 4.1: Rise of the Zandalari Features<br />
Last but not least, the official preview and patch notes! <br />
Patch 4.1 will soon be upon us, and it’s high time we dig into the meat of this patch to digest the new content, features, and official patch notes. The rise of the Zandalari (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2223-Patch-4.1-Content-Preview-Rise-of-the-Zandalari) is happening soon on a realm near you, so make sure you’ve read up on the new level-85 Stranglethorn quest line, as well as the updated dungeons of Zul’Gurub and Zul’Aman -- now suitable for five level-85 players with an average item level of 346 or higher. All-new epic gear, rare mounts, pets, and other interesting treasures await you, should you be able to rise to the challenge of the Zandalari!<br />
<br />
If you’ve found yourself waiting in dungeon queues longer than you’d like, we have a new system, Dungeon Finder: Call to Arms (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2243-Patch-4.1-Preview-Dungeon-Finder-Call-to-Arms), you should know about. The Dungeon Finder will be offering an additional incentive to players of underrepresented class roles. With this feature we hope to get you into the action faster.<br />
<br />
We’ve also built a new Guild Finder (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2263-Patch-4.1-Guild-Finder-Blizzard-QA-Jobs-Artworks-Fan-Arts) feature into the game interface and plan to expand upon its functionality in upcoming patches. Whether you’re a player looking for a guild, or a guild leader looking to recruit, this system facilitates those activities. We’re continuing to update, improve, and adjust the Guild Advancement system and want to make sure you’re given the tools to find and maintain a fun guild.<br />
<br />
If you’re already tackling content with your guildmates, you’ll probably be interested in the upcoming Guild Challenges (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2229-Ensidia-is-Awesome-Rogers-throttling-WoW-Guild-Challenges-Preview-Blue-Posts). By completing dungeons, raids, and Rated Battlegrounds in guild groups, you’ll attain new achievements, accrue gold for the Guild Vault, and earn guild experience above the current daily cap. We plan to introduce more Guild Challenges in future updates.<br />
<br />
Now, without further ado, here are the official 4.1 patch notes.<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft Client Patch 4.1<br />
<br />
Notes for all World of Warcraft patches can be found here (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/patch-notes/).<br />
<br />
Rise of the Zandalari<br />
<br />
The days when great troll empires stretched across ancient Kalimdor are long past. Millennia of war and internal strife have stripped these nations of their power, lands, and glory. As Azeroth recovers from the destruction of the Cataclysm, the world's divided troll populations face a bleak future. These dark times have spurred the trolls of the Zandalar, the historically wise and scholarly tribe from which all trolls originated, to take drastic action. They have embarked on a bold crusade to save their race by uniting trolls into a single mighty empire. With the Zandalari's aid, the fallen capitals of the Gurubashi and Amani nations—Zul'Gurub and Zul'Aman—are already rebuilding, replenishing their forces for a bloody campaign to expand their territories.<br />
<br />
Yet Vol'jin and his Darkspear trolls are not aligned with the Zandalari. They have sworn to stand with their Horde comrades—and even work with the Alliance—should the trolls ignite a new war on Azeroth. Soon, Vol'jin might be forced to act on his promise, for if the Gurubashi and Amani are left to their own devices, the world will know the legendary strength and savagery of the ancient troll empires once again.<br />
<br />
Guild Challenges<br />
<br />
Built into the Info panel of the guild user interface, Guild Challenges are weekly tasks guild groups can tackle for additional guild experience, achievements, and gold. At the top of the guild user interface Info pane, a new Guild Challenges section is displayed and broken into three categories: Dungeons, Raids, and Rated Battlegrounds. Any guild group will qualify for Guild Challenges credit and there is a set number of times each challenge can be completed per week.<br />
<br />
Guild Finder<br />
<br />
Guild Finder is a new system designed to enable easier and faster guild recruitment. Guild leaders and players who are looking for a guild to call home will use the Guild Finder to meet one another and begin communications that can lead to a prosperous membership. Whether you're a guild leader looking to fill your ranks or a player looking for a guild that meets your strictest requirements, the Guild Finder provides an easy way to make new friends!<br />
<br />
Dungeon Finder: Call to Arms<br />
<br />
A new system intended to lower queue times, Dungeon Finder: Call to Arms offers additional rewards for queuing as the currently least represented role. To be eligible for the additional rewards you must solo queue for a random level-85 Heroic in the role that is currently being Called to Arms, and complete the dungeon by killing the final boss. Every time you hit these requirements (there is no daily limit) you'll receive a goodie bag that will contain some gold, a chance at a rare gem, a chance at a flask/potion, a good chance of receiving a non-combat pet (including cross faction pets), and a very rare chance at receiving a mount.<br />
<br />
General<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Conquest Points are now purchasable from the Valor Quartermasters at 250 Conquest Points per 250 Valor Points.<br />
Honor Points are now purchasable from the Justice Trade Goods vendors at 250 Honor Points per 375 Justice Points.<br />
Justice Points are now purchasable from the Honor Trade Goods vendors at 250 Justice Points per 375 Honor Points.<br />
Resilience scaling has been modified for linear returns, as opposed to increasing returns. Under the new formula, going from 30 resilience to 40 resilience gives players the same increase to survivability as going from 0 to 10. Resilience now scales in the same way armor and magic resistances do. A player with 32.5% damage reduction from resilience in 4.0.6 should see their damage reduction unchanged in 4.1. Those with less than 32.5% will gain slightly. Those with more will lose some damage reduction, increasingly so as their resilience climbs.<br />
A dead player can now be resurrected by targeting them using the Party or Raid Frame even if they have released. No more hunting for corpses.<br />
<br />
<br />
Achievements<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A new feat of strength with an associated title, &quot;the Camel-Hoarder&quot;, has been added for players that have bested Dormus and obtained the Reins of the Grey Riding Camel -- because there must always be a Camel-Hoarder.<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
All non-damaging interrupts off the global cooldown will now always hit the target. This includes Pummel, Kick, Mind Freeze, Rebuke, Skull Bash, Counterspell, Wind Shear, Solar Beam, Silencing Shot, and related player pet abilities.<br />
Several persistent ground effects now display different visuals for hostile and friendly players. The following spells have the same visual effects for friendly players, but new alternate visuals for hostile players: Ring of Frost, Consecration, Desecration, Wild Mushroom, Flare, Ice Trap, Power Word: Barrier, Smoke Bomb, and Hand of Gul'dan. As a general rule, the alternate effects have a red tint or hue indicating they are created by an enemy player.<br />

<br />
<br />
Visual Settings Updates<br />
<br />
Removed the red bar preventing the overall graphics slider from going to ultra based on computer specs.<br />
When a player moves the overall slider to a setting that would have previously been prevented, any option that can't go as high as that setting will get the warning icon with a tooltip explaining why it can't go higher.

<br />
Is it just me or does this change seem to make elemental shammy aoe a bit convoluted. I'm all for making things a bit more interesting, but this seems to be a rather strange move;o Or maybe I am not thinking about it correctly.<br />

For sustained aoe dps, it would be earthquake on cd, magma totem (quite viable now that is lasts 60 secs), flame shock on cd (5 different targets (glyphed)), FN on cd (after x amount of targets are afflicted with FS?), fill with CL. I'm sure the actual values will be calculated soon if they aren't already.</div></div><hr />

Probably. I'd only really consider it &quot;milking&quot; people if the purchase of this mount was required for something else in-game that was otherwise unattainable. As with the sparkle pony if you don't like it, don't buy it. It's not costing you anything otherwise so stop bitching. <br />

Making little optional purchases like the mounts and the vanity pets has made Blizz many millions of dollars, and also raised an ass-ton of cash for the Make a Wish foundation. So I don't have any problems with them providing something people will want and buy.</div></div><hr />

We dont expect everything to be brand new - But we do expect SOMETHING to be brandnew in a &quot;content patch&quot;.<br />
<br />
Storemounts are Blizzard desission. I know quite a few players that quit the game because of them (most had other issues with the game as well). I personally really dont care. For me it just shows the game is ready to sink to a Hello kitty level for the money alone. But hey... thats what Blizzard wants and will continue to do. <br />
<br />
The only real downside to it is that other games have started doing it as well - and many of them are not at hello kitty standard so could ruin them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No mount has ever helped the make-a-wish foundation, in fact, there have been exactly 2 pets and only HALF of the revenue went to make-a-wish. Granted, it was a cool million the first time (we've never found out about the second one), but you think a company pulling in $200 million a month could just send over $5 million a year without making players have to buy something? Oh sorry, because then they can't make it a business expensive and write it off to stick it to the taxpayers. Corporate generosity indeed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They reuse tons of assets all over the place, but (to me) it makes perfect sense in the way that not everything needs to be always custom made for every content patch; the part where it feels a bit lazy on Blizzard's end is to reuse existing dungeons and rescaling/retuning them. Heroic 5-man ZA and ZG are not new, it's the same environments, bosses and mobs retuned for a different level of gameplay; while it makes sense financially to not have to develop something from scratch, a balance of the two is needed. <br />
<br />
At this point, patch 4.1 is just boredom-inducing to me because I have already done ZG and ZA countless times even if it has been years since I've set foot in those places, but I understand it will be entirely new to some players. Can't make everybody happy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think alot of ppl will not bother with it. And it will probably lead to many players just quitting this expansion all together. The raid progress in this expansion is just not right. Next raid content should been out already and pretty much everyone that were intrested in raiding should have killed at least normal bosses and have gear that way to progress to next one. If not they get the gear fast with valor. Instead BLizzard created a + 6/7 itemlvl troll junk that they made purple ... Not to mention in a reused content and armor looks. <br />
<br />
The thing is... Blizzard is counting on the storemount to make more money than from subs. Thats fine... Until they realise that the ppl that dont sub - will not buy stroremounts.<br />
<br />
Patch 4.1 is the weakest content patch in history of WOW. And that includes such junk ones as the barber shop and ingame voicechat ones.... Blizzard should come out and publicly apologise for what they have been doing over the last 6 months. Cause quite frankly - it is a joke.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh please. I'm gonna guess you started playing in either Wrath or late BC. Cause at least we are getting dungeons in this one. Go check out, for example...<br />
<br />
Patch 1.10 (http://www.wowpedia.org/Patch_1.10) - Added Dungeon Set 2 and Weather effects. That's it.<br />
<br />
Or...<br />
<br />
Patch 2.2 (http://www.wowpedia.org/Patch_2.2.0) - Added Voice Chat (Which nobody ever uses). That's it.<br />
<br />
Seriously, nobody ever promised you a new raid every few months. In BC, we had all the raids except Sunwell by May of 2007 (4 months after launch) and then NOTHING until March of 2008 when Sunwell released (10 months later). Ok, I shouldn't say nothing, cause we did get ZA but that was really only good for bear runs cause most serious raiders already far outgeared the loot that dropped there. So Blizzard still has about 5 months to release 4.2 before it matches its longest content drought.<br />
<br />
And before anyone points out that there were more raids/bosses available at launch in BC, it doesn't matter. Black Temple was being regularly cleared within a month after it released, with the world first coming about 2 weeks after release because people had already cleared everything else.</div></div><hr />

So Blizzard still has about 5 months to release 4.2 before it matches its longest content drought.<br />
<br />
I played TBC - it had alot of stuff out at launch and that meant ppl had something to progress with. Sure We did finish killing every boss well before sunwell... but then we needed to get 25 ppl geared up.<br />
<br />
Patch 1.1o and 2.2 were not content patces. They did not need to add content at that point. Right now WOW NEEDS new raid content cause the options available for ppl to progress their main is way to limited. Kill the same bosses in Heroic... thats it... And alot of ppl dont bother with it since putting same boss into another difficulty lvl is not really a new content. Its just lazy.<br />
<br />
Patch 4.1 is a joke - It has already cost BLizzard big time cause its insulting to ppl that have been playing the game from day one and already done ZG and ZA in the orginal state. Blizzard removed those dungeons JUST to let subscriber that already payed for these instances pay for them again. Thats lazy - arrogant and quite frankly sad.</div></div><hr />

I play a prot Paladin, and as much as I agree the WoG change is bullshit, it isn't that bad.<br />

Now it means I can loosen my spec from selfhealing and focus more on direct TPS, going into Rule of Law and Reckoning. Word of Glory is still as good as it was, and if you ask me it was indeed quite OP to be able to chain cast it when you got HoPo back thanks to the prot tier 1 talent.

Black temple did not release at launch. It was released in patch 2.1 about 6 months into the expansion... Yes mister.. thats about the same time we are getting patch 4.1 in Cata... with 2 recycled old dungeons turned into alt runs. <br />

Lmao, most of you people dont understand the actual point in this patch.<br />
Why do you think they're giving out 352 epics, and 980 valor a week?<br />
Lol, its getting everyone ready for new raid content.<br />
As of right now, we're not ready for Firelands.<br />
There our only a handful of guilds that have gotten past chim on heroic and cho'gall on heroic.<br />
Hopefully this patch will fix this, stop complaining about this patch.<br />
You're the one that spent money on the game, and agreed to the terms of service.<br />
<br />
Why on earth should ppl need to kill all heroic bosses to do next normal tier. Heroic geared ppl shoudl be able to skip Normals and go straight to heroic. Thats a normal progression based on CONTENT where you should not have to kill same bosses on multiple difficulty levels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You really do come off as an idiot. If you really cared to do the math, you would be fully aware that new raid content is NOT due out yet. We are supposed to have 5 to 6 months between raid content patches. In Wrath, they screwed up their timeline only giving us 4 months in Ulduar (which was far too short by their own admission) and 4 months in ToC (thank goodness). This left us with one entire year (almost exactly too, 364 days total) in ICC. <br />
<br />
Patch 4.2 (with all of our new raid content) will be out in the next 1-2 months, right on schedule. We are simply seeing smaller patches as we did in Vanilla. If you don't like it, you certainly do not have to. <br />
<br />
Also, I don't know what patch you think the Barber Shop landed in, but it landed in the WotLK pre-patch along with achievements, Stormwind Harbor, Inscription, 51 point talent trees, mount/pet tabs, and a month later, Northrend. I also don't understand how you could feel that 2 new 5-mans, new quests, new archaeology items, and new game systems all together are WORSE than the singular release of voice chat that NOBODY USES.</div></div><hr />

Mainly because the end-raid-bosses are always supposed to be the hardest.<br />
And...(this is just speculation)<br />
The first few bosses are going to be as hard as Heroic Cho'Gall on difficulty level, in firelands.<br />

lol at ppl thinking Blizzard is gonna be releasing next raid tier in late may - june or July ... when most ppl will be on vacations (including Blizzard devs) They will say ppl are still progressing with alts in Troll dungeons and will leave it to mid August. <br />
<br />
THe voice chat patch was not a content patch. It was a technical patch because at that point there was plenty of Raid content in the game. Everyone knew at that point that ZA was coming 1 month later. <br />
<br />
PPL are more than ready for next set of raid tier.. The progression should be that ppl doing normal dungeons should be able to continue their progress by going into the next tier of normals. And those that do Heroic dungeons should be able to go directly into heroic content (after maybe 1 week in normals to learn the basics). That how the CONTENT progress should be like.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Welcome to WoW? Seriously, this has been going on since launch. Even Blizzard has said on multiple occasions that it is impossible for them to release quality content as fast or faster than people complete it. Because no matter how fast they pump it out, somebody somewhere has completed it and is now bored.<br />
<br />
Since Wrath launched, Blizzard has aimed to release a new raid every 5-7 months, and on average have hit that mark. We are barely at 5 months from the release of Cata. The new raid is coming, and they are giving us 2 new dungeons to run now instead of waiting until the raid is finished like they would have done in Wrath. And yeah, I am calling them new because the fight mechanics and storylines have changed.</div></div><hr />

My server is only 2/5 in BoT H<br />
<br />
So what if your server is 2/5 ? Pretty much proves my point. PPL are simply not bothered with it. <br />
<br />
Difficulty is based on lvls and gear in mmoRPGs. When you realise that then maybe you will solo MC and see that what was once challenging is now easy. <br />
<br />
Blizzard controls the difficulty with tuning of the bosses. If some servers are just 2/5 then dont point fingers at the Players. Point fingers at the devs that are probably the main reason why your top guilds are forced to gear up new members every week cause the players quitting dont see the point in doing the same bosses in another difficulty level.<br />
<br />
The gear progression in the game is wrong atm. That leads to Blizzard needing to nerf content instead of beeing able to keep it the same and simply bridge the diffrence with better gear. This is very much possible like GC has already stated. PPl that are not even done with Nef in normal or heroic should be able to do first bosses in new tier (considering that most have 359 full gear now with valor anyway) - and then go back and kill nef if they wanted. WITHOUT nerfing the first tier. And NEF should STILL give rewards that would help with continued progression in t2 dungeons. Thats normal progression - something that BLizzard isn't getting right atm. <br />
<br />
The progression should not be normal t1 - heroic t1 - normal t2 heroic t2 - It should be normal t1 - normal t2 - heroic t1 -Normal t3 - heroic t2. - heroic t3<br />
<br />
PPl that now sit and do nothing in Capitals are just prove how bad BLizzard got it. THey are foced to do heroic tier 1 when they should be done with normal tier 1 and working on normal tier 2 - THEN they have ENTIRE extra heroic tier 1 dungeon to go back into and raid more content for better rewards - if they wanted.<br />
<br />
Problem is that ppl are bored and they are stuck in progressing their character. And thats because the current raid content progression is flawed. Patch 4.1 will not change that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems you are defining a content patch as anything that includes a raid. So fine. 4.1 isn't a content patch because it doesn't include a raid. Therefore 4.1 can't be the worst content patch Blizzard ever made. Quit whining.<br />
<br />
I am going to trust that Blizzard has far better numbers than you or anyone who doesn't work for them on how much of the playerbase has completed the current content. I get it, you are pro. You and your guild have cleared all the content you wish to and you are ready for more. Awesome. But since you cleared it faster than a good portion of the rest of us mere mortals, now you have to wait for us to catch up.<br />
<br />
But lets play in your hypothetical world. Lets say Blizzard has all the raids up to, and including, Deathwing in the game at launch. You spend 2 or 3 months clearing everything. Then you whine that you have nothing to do because everything is cleared, and likely quit the game until the next x-pac because there is no more content coming.<br />
<br />
OR...Blizzard rushes out the content for you, spacing it out every two to three months. On this pace, what is likely to be every raid planned for this expansion would be out within a year. So after that, you would complain that there is no new content coming until the next x-pac and likely quit playing, but not before spending almost that entire year of content complaining about the poor quality of the raids and how Blizzard fails for doing crappy work just to get another raid out.<br />
<br />
So no matter what, you are going to complain. It is just a matter of are you going to complain now, or later. And yes, I really can't stand people like you that can't either shut up and enjoy the game, or if they are really not that happy with it, take their money elsewhere without feeling the need to let everybody know first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dungeons are playable content - voice chat is not playable content. 4.1 is a cotent patch with very weak content launched 5 months into a new expansion when alot of players are calling for new raiding content. And that does not only include the hardcores.<br />

That was the orginal plan from Blizzard - to have new expansion every year.. ofc until they took most of the devs over to TITAN and put the interns in charge of WOW with zero design freedom. Next expasnion is probably 3 years away ? At least thats the case considering raid progression in Cata atm. <br />
<br />
Do the math - 3 years worth of your sub money and probably 3 store mounts... why on earth should they bother with putting out expansnion any time sooner when they can spend the sub money and the design time on another game...<br />
<br />
I still would like to ask how that will benefit your character in WOW? The one you actually pay sub for you know ?</div></div><hr />

you're already 13/13 heroic? if you are then i hear ya. I just see this comment very often from people who haven't cleared current content yet. I've actually seen forum posts from people cryinga bout new content who's top progressoin is argaloth.</div></div><hr />

So you got all classes and all professions ingame as well ? PPl choose what content they do. PPL will probably kill Sinestra one day - but there are alot of other factors that make it very hard to do atm. One of it beeing the fact that you have to do the same content again and there are alot of ppl that simply not bother and chancel sub until next patch. And that means a guild needs to regear more ppl and so on.<br />

<br />
That idea comes from a quote from, around the time BC launched, from the lead producer of WoW at the time, saying they would like to do 1 expansion of year but they were not sure if that was possible. They never committed to it. <br />
<br />
We are on almost the exact same pace of content that Wrath was on, which would have had Cataclysm out about 16-18 months after Wrath launched. By their own admission, that was the schedule Blizzard had for Wrath and Cata until Cata got delayed. Icecrown was released 13 months after Wrath launched and we were stuck in that hell for almost a year exactly. They will announce the new x-pac at Blizzcon this year, the Deathwing raid will go into the game around Feb/March and, unless something happens like it did with Cata, we will be playing the expansion by summer of 2012.</div></div><hr />

Lol, just how many raid tiers do you expect there to be in Cataclysm? Even with your ridiculous prediction of 8+ month patch cycles, we're no more than two years away from the next expansion. <br />
<br />
I do not remember ANYTHING saying that there would be a new expansion every year - nor would I be interested in paying 40 bucks every year on top of my subscription for 2 tiers of content. If you would, that's great, go play Guild Wars and you can spend as much money as your little heart desires.

I expect the content to become harder. That means it takes longer to kill each boss. And unless Blizzard are making fewer bosses each tier - It will take longer to clear each for the casual player that is suposed to see all the content acording to BLizzard.<br />
<br />
MOst ppl would gladly pay 40 buck + sub a year for a good mmo game with plenty of content. Even more. <br />
<br />

You mean you don't count hardmodes because you can't do them? Many of the hard mode fights are significantly different than their normal counterparts. You're not really &quot;done&quot; with 4.0 if you haven't beaten them.<br />

How dare people that take things like PVP seriously be mad over changes like that which make zero sense and is a completely unbalanced mechanic. Thank you for being the way you and many others are with this mentality, allowing blizzard to ruin my favorite game.<br />

How come people QQ now? We get a new patch which is getting released some time before it was originally planed because its not getting released at the same time as firelands. How can people be mad about that? Cool we get a minor patch (not really minor but w/e) before the big one, great. But instead you QQ about this patch not beeing bundled up with firelands the next 1-2months... why?<br />
<br />
And one more thing, why do I even make comments on this page to try to explain to the oxygen deprived children lurking around here trying to find reasons to whine and moan.<br />
<br />
I dont even know...<br />
<br />
Because this patch offers nothing new, and &quot;4.2&quot; should have launched by the end of last month, instead they're putting out a &quot;why even bother patch&quot; with recycled and rehashed content along with features nobody asked for nor care about. Since you seem to be lacking the capacity to understand why people are upset I figured I'd help you out. Though capacity and stockholm syndrome may still not allow you to understand this.<br />

I'm currently completing my Master's in English literature, so I can definitely read. If you will link me the source that says all of the good developers have left WoW for Titan, that would be great.<br />
<br />
I know you're not talking to me, but seriously, it's been said numerous times now. Even in one of the last interviews (not the Q&amp;A) it came straight from the horses mouth and &quot;they were confident that despite key personnel moving on, the people left behind have been working on the game for a couple months and they're good enough&quot;.

I can't wait for 4.1 and I'm glad that Firelands isn't out yet. My guild is only 8/13 on heroic mode content, so I would like to finish that before Firelands comes out.</div></div><hr />

Heroic 5-man ZA and ZG are not new, it's the same environments, bosses and mobs retuned for a different level of gameplay; while it makes sense financially to not have to develop something from scratch, a balance of the two is needed. <br />
<br />
At this point, patch 4.1 is just boredom-inducing to me because I have already done ZG and ZA countless times even if it has been years since I've set foot in those places, but I understand it will be entirely new to some players. Can't make everybody happy.<br />
<br />
because once you kill everything in the place nothing ever ever inhabits it again, right, the thing is, it's logical for them to &quot;reuse&quot; content, when really, they aren't, they're reusing the place, but not really reusing the content, get over yourselves imo</div></div><hr />

As of right now, we're not ready for Firelands.<br />
There our only a handful of guilds that have gotten past chim on heroic and cho'gall on heroic.<br />
Hopefully this patch will fix this, stop complaining about this patch.<br />
You're the one that spent money on the game, and agreed to the terms of service.<br />

This. I'm so sick of people bitching about &quot;reusing&quot; content &gt;.&lt; it's tiresome to read all these wow is dying posts, blizzards sucks blah blah blah, and yet most of them are still giving blizzard money. lol<br />
<br />
Can't wait, hopefully this will fix retarded warrior damage.<br />
I just wish destro/ele (and all other non-viable specs) got some lovin. :(<br />

and currently Destro is the highest rated warlock spec, until 4.1 (tomorrow) when it will be affliction[COLOR=&quot;red&quot;]<br />

Thats a total of 1470 valor voints per week for doing randoms. The cap is 1250, so you can only get 1250. But Blue is saying the max you can get from randoms is 980? Doesn't add up for me.</div></div><hr />

What doesn't add up? They're capping it at 980(or 7 of the new heroics). They don't want you to be able to cap it completely by doing just heroics.</div></div><hr />

Heroic geared ppl shoudl be able to skip Normals and go straight to heroic. Thats a normal progression based on CONTENT where you should not have to kill same bosses on multiple difficulty levels.<br />
<br />
because, if you look back on wrath raid tiers, for example toc -&gt; icc, the heroic ToC loot was still lower/equal ilvl to the normal icc loot (yes im counting both 10 and 25) 25 hard mode toc loot was 258 ilvl, and normal icc 10 was 251, and 25 was 264, so no, heroic raid geared people should not be able to skip the normal modes of the next raid tier, which isnt possible anyway, since you have to kill the end boss on normal to unlock the ability to switch to hard modes</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can either just spam the Troll heroics to reach your soft cap of 980 or you can do a mixture of Random heroics and Troll heroics to hit your soft cap of 980. 1250 is a hard cap. You can only gain a max of 980 per week from Hroics af of 4.1 so to cap your VP you would also need to down enough Raiding content (270 points worth) to reach 1250.</div></div><hr />

you only get VP for the first 7 heroics of any tier you do, so you can do say 3 &quot;tier 1&quot; heroics and then 4 &quot;tier 2&quot; heroics, and you're capped at VP for the week, at least that's how i understand the wording on the dungeon finder</div></div><hr />

The Weekly TOTAL valor cap from any source is 1250.<br />
<br />
The TOTAL valor that can be earned from RANDOM HEROICS of any kind is 980, so 6 troll heroics and 2 regular heroics, or 4 troll heroics and 6 regular heroics, or pretty much any combination in between.</div></div><hr />

You get Valor Points for the first 7 random heroics per week. It doesn't matter which tier, original heroics or troll heroics. you can do any combination of those up to 7 times. <br />
<br />
4 normal heroics and 3 troll, that would be you seven weekly and would net you 700 Valor. Or all 7 troll would be the max per week. 7 original heroic would be half that.</div></div><hr />

Raids: each boss once a week. <br />
Valor points: you can get more from new heroics, but still, there's a cap. <br />
<br />
Why so much restriction? If I have to time to do a 25man during the week and 10m during the weekend, why can't I? I have alts for fun, but I really don't care about gearing them, why am I forced to play them if I want to raid more than once a week? I get it that some guilds had trouble with getting 25 people for raiding, but the way it is now, if I, for example, pug a raid and we don't complete, players can get more screwed than before. Or if my guild does a 25m and doesn't complete and can't get 25 for the next day, getting 2x 10 and having to pug people, is even worse. <br />
<br />
If I have time to get VP in a week to gear my char, who cares? Is that to keep players from gearing fast, getting bored and stop subscribing?</div></div><hr />

&quot;Deliberate&quot; Talent Transfer To Project &quot;Titan&quot;<br />

As Blizzard transferred its most veteran WoW developers to the new project Titan, other experienced WoW developers at the studio have taken the reins of the MMORPG over the last couple of years.<br />

&quot;I believe [it's] the most ambitious thing we've ever attempted,&quot; Sams said. &quot;And I feel like we have set our company up to succeed on that. We have some of our most talented and most experienced developers on that team. Many of the people that built World of Warcraft are full time on that other team.&quot;<br />

<br />
But VP isn't there as the main route for raiders to gear their characters, it's there as a consolation prize if you don't get drops. 'VP in a week to gear my char' is 10900 VP - that's 156 10-man bosses. Do you not think that you might get a better drop than the T11 on one of your slots before you reach that? Or, you could just get very lucky with the drops and gear yourself from head to toe on one round of the 12 bosses (I'm assuming this is Normal you're talking about, because why they hell would you even be bothered with VP if you're going after Heroic bosses, right?). <br />
<br />
<br />
Is that to keep players from gearing fast, getting bored and stop subscribing?<br />
<br />
I'm confused - do you crave boredom?</div></div><hr />

i love how you assume they're interns, when no mention is even made of interns, it could be developers lower in the ranks, that doesnt mean interns, it's ignorant people like you who take things way out of proportion and twist it to say what you want it to to make you feel better<br />

Right now Blizzard is DESIGNING Titan... No.. not running it.. designing it .. with their designers that designed WOW.<br />
<br />
In the mean time they got ppl RUNNING the WOW game. Maybe you call Path of the Titan that never was and ZG recycled content to be a design.... <br />

Registered just to have my 2 cents said. <br />
<br />
First off - you're just plain wrong. You are simply straight up, wrong. Your understanding of raid progression is that people are to clear the next tier just to clear heroic modes from the earlier tier.. Why would you assume such a dumb thing? They are called HARD MODES, for a reason - because they are hard - Or you didn't manage to clear them and there of wanted a higher iLvL just to be able to &quot;clear the progress&quot; - is it too hard, is that what you saying?<br />
<br />
As for the load of steaming pile of shit, which would be your &quot;Oh all the good devs left the WoW team&quot; - I've played since Vanilla - and the pure amount of ignorance, of sheer blindness to as of what you are given in 1 bloody patch - I mean, let alone that they DELAYED the Firelands patch just to fit YOU, the one PAYING, for THEIR game, AGREEING to their TERMS OF USE, implying that you are actually paying, for something you play - And to top that off, just to top that sheer, obvious trolling off, you throw in a rant about Store mounts. Guess what. They are NOT mandatory in, _ANY_ remote way to accomplish ANYTHING in WoW. <br />
<br />
As the matter of fact is, you bought this - you payed for this - this is the complete and utter result of your money - or most likely your parents seeing how you act like a complete trolling kiddo - In the end, you are powerless. There is no but, nothing more to it - you are chasing straws that you cooked up, that you sought to justify what a &quot;terrible&quot; MMORPG WoW has become, when it has merely become better and filled with more and more content over the years - As for losing subs, who cares? Their costumer base is large enough to lose a thousand of your kind and STILL go far beyond in profit - compared to whatever pathetic thing you have ever achieved in your life.</div></div><hr />

This will give you an even better chance to beat those bosses that are blocking you now. We wouldn’t be surprised to see some guilds try the first few Firelands bosses one night, while using the next night to go back to get the head and chests from Nef and Cho’gall in order to complete their set bonuses, that is until acquiring new set bonuses becomes feasible. <br />
<br />
This is a Quote form CG so dont blame me about the raid curve progress... http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/164608/ghostcrawler-developer-blog-raid-progress<br />
<br />
I never said you should have to clear the tier above to go into heroics that are tier lower. It should be so that you still get benefits from doing heroics versison in lower tier - And you know what GC agrees ! sorry... <br />
And about &quot;hard modes&quot; - Hard is never harder than the lvl and the grear you wear. <br />
<br />
Here is the thing.. Im not paying for the game atm - In fact Im here trying to get other ppl to understand what exactly the money they are putting into WOW are going into. No - thats not going onto your characters in WOW - Its going into another MMO project - project that has nothing to do with you - your sub money - or the characters that you are creating in RPG mmo game. Fantastic news how a 12 milion sub based MMO game managed to treat their players right ?</div></div><hr />

The idiocy of your posts in this thread have actually provoked me into signing up. <br />

You obviously have very little knowledge of the type of teams it takes to design and produce anything. As someone who has worked in the web industry, and dated a few individuals at different levels in the gaming industry, I'll help you out a little. Even in small projects, there are generally people in a position called a &quot;Lead,&quot; basically, what they do, is manage several smaller teams, composed of artists, programmers, writers.. etc. In those teams, there is generally a lead of sorts, that helps to oversee the senior and junior developers. There is definitely a hierarchy of people, and to insinuate that any of them are to be called interns is a flat out insult.<br />
<br />
Take a look at the scope and depth of material within WoW, it is highly reasonable to assume they have multiple teams assigned to different aspects of the game, each with their own hierarchy as explained above. It is reasonable to assume that a team lead, or senior developer, could have proven their skill and abilities to move up into a higher position, while others moved onto &quot;Titan.&quot; To call a programmer who could have spent countless hours working on this game and received a promotion as his superiors moved onto a new project, an intern, shows you have very limited knowledge of how any corporate structure works. <br />

About 4.1, I'm excited for it, as the guild I'm in is more casual, and with finals here, our raiding Cata content has basically stopped. This has allowed some of the older players to take the newer players on other fun things.. Like doing ICC achievements, Naxx, etc. Since the raiding has slowed down, there are people who are missing stuff in slots that can be filled in ZA/ZG that will make our raiding that much more easy when people are done with school. Not to mention the ability to have far better enchants through these 2 dungeons and with honor/justice maelstroms. I get that there are people and guilds out there who have cleared all the content and are stomping their feet for more, but from browsing many forums and looking at the servers I play on, the majority of the community isn't ready for a new tier of raids, and see ZA/ZG as buff to get them there.<br />
<br />
As someone who has recently started playing, I am fond of this content delivery schedule. I saw someone a few pages back mention how there were 25 raid bosses available at one point. To me that seems as if the content would feel like much more of a chore, than a game.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myah</div><div class="date">2011-04-25, 07:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But VP isn't there as the main route for raiders to gear their characters, it's there as a consolation prize if you don't get drops. 'VP in a week to gear my char' is 10900 VP - that's 156 10-man bosses. Do you not think that you might get a better drop than the T11 on one of your slots before you reach that? Or, you could just get very lucky with the drops and gear yourself from head to toe on one round of the 12 bosses (I'm assuming this is Normal you're talking about, because why they hell would you even be bothered with VP if you're going after Heroic bosses, right?). <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm confused - do you crave boredom?<br />
<br />
Maybe I didn't express myself properly, not just the VP limits that I don't like, but not being able to do more than one encounter each week on my main. That's one of the restrictions I was talking about. Doesn't matter if you get gear or VP, you still can each boss once a week. <br />
Even if there are 12 bosses, you can't always pick which one you want to do. You gotta go through the whole BoT to get to last one, for example. And same will probably be with new upcoming raids.<br />
<br />
And the 2 new heroics, lets face it, do it 7 times in one char is gonna be boring as hell, and for alts, ugh. Just 2 options lol<br />
<br />
Yes, I do crave boredom. Kidding. My point is that getting gear is not what makes me bored. Not having something to do or not being able to do something I want (even if 5 times the same raid) is what bores me.</div></div><hr />

Lol - yes you obviously know alot based on dating .. lol Interns is pretty much the right name for ppl that are &quot;trained up to run the game&quot;... thats not my words - that was BLizzard talking.<br />
<br />
And also you recently started playing ... and you are telling ppl that have payed sub already for ZA and ZG how they are supposed to feel about a content patch beeing what they already payed a sub for few years ago ?<br />
<br />
Get a clue what long term RPG development is about. Cause its not about sending out recycled content for the long term playerbase expecting them to pay for it second time around. ANd that is pretty much exactly the last straw that many see now with WOW. BLizzard doesn't care about their long term playerbase. Their main goal atm is to milk the cow with recyled content for the 12 year olds so they can develop next MMO for the sub money. <br />
<br />
Hope next date you get will be able to tell you that ppl that play WOW care about their characters IN WOW - not in what BLizzard is doing with their sub money on another project that has nothing to do with progression or design of WOW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, thats not the right word at all. I'll give you a good example. I have several developers who work under me with many years of development experience. They have worked on multimillion dollar projects as well as several in-house development projects. Often, we have a team member who needs to go on maternity leave, or accepts a position in another organization. At that time, we will train developers from a different team to work on software and systems they haven't worked on before. While they do not have the same level of experience on the particular product they are training on, they have considerable experience in developing software. In addition, we don't promote people directly to &quot;decision making&quot; positions who are from other teams; a team member with experience in the area gets bumped up, and another developer from a different team (again, with considerable experience on that team) is &quot;trained up&quot; on the specific systems involved with their new team.<br />
<br />
An intern is someone we hire for a summer position (3-6) to shuffle papers. There is a considerable gap between the two, and if I had to venture a guess, Blizzard follows a similar pattern. I'm confused whether you really don't know the difference since you haven't worked in a professional development setting (which is my guess) or there is a language barrier here.<br />
<br />
In addition... you do realize that Blizzard doesn't funnel all it's money into a particular product, correct? Funds collected from sales of all titles end up being distributed between titles. I'm sure money from World of Warcraft subscriptions also funded Starcraft development, and Starcraft sales funded World of Warcraft expansion development or Titan development. Because they have decided to work on another title doesn't mean they aren't using the subs appropriately; for all we know, they could (and probably are) spending subscription money on many other titles currently under development and unannounced.<br />
<br />
A good portion of the &quot;negative&quot; posts so far fall into two realms of thought; one, a marked lack of understanding into how game development works. Because some &quot;senior&quot; developers left a team doesn't mean that the team is now gutted. As someone said above, it's more than likely that design leads were shifted to Titan to help give their design experience to that team, and senior developers (these being still &quot;A&quot; team members, if you care to call it that) moved up to team lead positions and mentored newer developers. Second, a vocal minority of people who feel the need to cut down stuff they aren't interested in, while the rest of the player base is thrilled by it. It's unfortunate you aren't happy with the new heroics coming out, but a good portion of the player base is. I've played since Vanilla when playing a paladin was awful; I'm still psyched to see what Blizzard does with ZA/ZG. To claim things are worse now then they were then or how WOW is in a &quot;nosedive&quot; is fairly ridiculous, and clearly illustrates a complete lack of perspective on how things used to be. You aren't going to change any minds by screaming from the street corner about how Blizzard is wasting someone's money, especially when you don't even subscribe yourself; you just look like a raving lunatic.</div></div><hr />

At that time, we will train developers from a different team to work on software and systems they haven't worked on before. While they do not have the same level of experience on the particular product they are training on, they have considerable experience in developing software. In addition, we don't promote people directly to &quot;decision making&quot; positions who are from other teams; a team member with experience in the area gets bumped up, and another developer from a different team (again, with considerable experience on that team) is &quot;trained up&quot; on the specific systems involved with their new team.<br />
<br />
An intern is someone we hire for a summer position (3-6) to shuffle papers. There is a considerable gap between the two, and if I had to venture a guess, Blizzard follows a similar pattern. I'm confused whether you really don't know the difference and haven't worked in a professional development setting (which is my guess) or there is a language barrier here.<br />
<br />
In addition... you do realize that Blizzard doesn't funnel all it's money into a particular product, correct? Funds collected from sales of all titles end up being distributed between titles. I'm sure money from World of Warcraft subscriptions also funded Starcraft development, and Starcraft sales funded World of Warcraft expansion development. Because they have decided to work on another title doesn't mean they aren't using the subs appropriately; for all we know, they could (and probably are) spending subscription money on many other titles currently under development and unannounced.<br />
<br />
A good portion of the &quot;negative&quot; posts so far fall into two realms of thought; one, a marked lack of understanding into how game development works. Because some &quot;senior&quot; developers left a team doesn't mean that the team is now gutted. As someone said above, it's more than likely that design leads left, and senior developers (these being still &quot;A&quot; team members, if you care to call it that) moved up to team lead positions and mentored younger developers. Second, a vocal minority of people who feel the need to cut down stuff they aren't interested in, while the rest of the player base is thrilled by it. It's unfortunate you aren't happy with the new heroics coming out, but a good portion of the player base is. I've played since Vanilla when playing a paladin was awful; I'm still psyched to see what Blizzard does with ZA/ZG. To claim things are worse now then they were then or how WOW is in a &quot;nosedive&quot; is fairly ridiculous, and clearly illustrates a complete lack of perspective on how things used to be. You aren't going to change any minds by screaming from the street corner about how Blizzard is wasting someone's money, especially when you don't even subscribe yourself; you just look like a raving lunatic.<br />
<br />
Well - Its BLizzard talking about &quot;training&quot; Maybe explain to the PR Titan team thats not the right word ? <br />
<br />
What ppl are realising now - and it became very aparent with 4.1 - is that the focus from BLizzard has turned away from WOW into the new project. You might disagree and claim that some ppl are pshyched about recycled ZG and ZA instances. I dont think you will find alot of long term subs that agree with you. <br />
<br />
WOW is taking a nosedive in terms of Innovative game design. Archeology is sort of proof of that. Why ? Where is Path of the Titans ? <br />

Fantastic news how a 12 milion sub based MMO game managed to treat their players right ?<br />
<br />
So wait, you're telling me that a company uses its earnings to fund other projectss? THIS IS MADNESS!!! Blizzard has NO RIGHT to use MY hard earned money to pay for something else that they are creating. They should put EVERY DAMN cent back into the game that I pay for.<br />

<br />
What I've realized now is that Cataclysm is more fun than any expansion I've played, and my account has been active since March 2, 2005. I'm glad that Blizzard replaced the people who thought that five minute paladin buffs were a good idea, that every class with a healing tree should heal, that Princess HuHu should require entire forty man guilds to farm Maraudon for level 50 nature resist gear, that Dwarf priests should be the only race of priests with fear ward and then design several encounters that needed the fear ward buff, that having fourty people complete attunement quests was a good idea, that Shaman loot dropped for Alliance guilds and paladin loot for Horde guilds, that you couldn't shift click on the auction house, and that there should be a cap on the number of debuffs on a boss.<br />
<br />
Yea, I would say that WoW has totally taken a nose dive since then :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

I would suggest you take another look at this thread. The numbers aren't in your favor; the vast majority of the player base enjoys the new content.

<br />
And to call a seasoned developer an &quot;intern&quot; shows you have a gross lack of understanding of game development, as well as software development as a whole. Unless you have some credentials to back up that assessment, I suggest you do a slight bit of research. When you express the opinion of trolling a forum to try to tell people where their money is going, and being completely ignorant not only of game development but of any form of company management in general, &quot;raving lunatic&quot; fits quite well.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like fair to me - After all - my sub only allows me to log into WOW - not into Starcraft, Diablo 3 or Titan when it comes out....<br />
<br />
This is a sub based MMO game.. maybe you know understand why ppl are chancelling their subs when they see things like this.... WOW is a game that has the money to keep the game in full development with massive focus on new innovated content and updated tech. Thats what ppl expect for a sub based MMO game that is doing well.

<br />
Even if Blizzard channeled every cent back into WoW, the returns wouldn't be as impressive as you think. There comes a point where throwing more money at something won't make it any better.<br />
<br />
And what would you be doing if 4.1 still had ZG and ZA coming back because it fit the story line? It's not like they would make brand new troll dungeons when they have existing ones to reuse. Especially since the whole point of the Zandalari story line is that they're reuniting the old troll empire, which is best represented by the two dungeons of Zul'Gurub and Zul'Aman.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sodia</div><div class="date">2011-04-25, 08:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I played TBC - it had alot of stuff out at launch and that meant ppl had something to progress with. Sure We did finish killing every boss well before sunwell... but then we needed to get 25 ppl geared up.<br />
<br />
Patch 1.1o and 2.2 were not content patces. They did not need to add content at that point. Right now WOW NEEDS new raid content cause the options available for ppl to progress their main is way to limited. Kill the same bosses in Heroic... thats it... And alot of ppl dont bother with it since putting same boss into another difficulty lvl is not really a new content. Its just lazy.<br />
<br />
Patch 4.1 is a joke - It has already cost BLizzard big time cause its insulting to ppl that have been playing the game from day one and already done ZG and ZA in the orginal state. Blizzard removed those dungeons JUST to let subscriber that already payed for these instances pay for them again. Thats lazy - arrogant and quite frankly sad.<br />
<br />
ahh yes you played in TBC:P ...... i remember this in other weay there was hmmm 40% that saw lets say 70% of the content byfore Sunwell the rest was on grull or kara and go to BT and other instances after that masive nerf patch so pleas at last try:)</div></div><hr />

Like always - Namecalling is always the best way to undermind the turth =) <br />
I suggest you do some research yourself - including that a dev will not point out the weak points of their game - but will focus on talking down those that dare to point them out. Sounds pretty much exactly what you are doing. <br />
<br />
But hey.. its great to hear a BLizzard dev is talking about their forums as a hospital. Thank god hes not my doctor even tho he would probably gladly keep taking my sub so he can ignore the comunity and put more time posting his god articles. <br />
<br />
The funny thing about this all is that you have zero idea what is actually going on at BLizzard. Just think back to TOC and onwards and you see pretty much what the &quot;interns&quot; are doing.... ANd sorry.... I consider ppl that can't do better than that to be called interns every time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And also you recently started playing ... and you are telling ppl that have payed sub already for ZA and ZG how they are supposed to feel about a content patch beeing what they already payed a sub for few years ago ?<br />
<br />
Get a clue what long term RPG development is about. Cause its not about sending out recycled content for the long term playerbase expecting them to pay for it second time around. ANd that is pretty much exactly the last straw that many see now with WOW. BLizzard doesn't care about their long term playerbase. Their main goal atm is to milk the cow with recyled content for the 12 year olds so they can develop next MMO for the sub money. <br />
<br />
Hope next date you get will be able to tell you that ppl that play WOW care about their characters IN WOW - not in what BLizzard is doing with their sub money on another project that has nothing to do with progression or design of WOW.<br />
<br />
My experience has been gained from my own profession and through relationships with those in other professions. It is obvious that you have very little working knowledge of being a functioning adult in society. I've seen sources posted of Blizzard speaking in regards to the individuals that have went onto this new project, would you kindly provide sources where they used the terminology that you are? <br />
<br />
I admitted that I have only recently started playing, would my logic or reading comprehension of what has been stated from Blizzard be anymore powerful if I had been playing since Beta? In my previous post, nowhere have I implied how anyone should feel. I stated how I feel about the content that is coming, and reiterated some things that Blizzard has said, one of which you have previously quoted in which they spoke of Firelands. The content you deem as being regurgitated in 4.1, while having stuff removed from it, is still available to play, therefore anyone currently paying for a subscription, is paying for something they already have access to/may have already played, to play it on a different level. Would you also go so far as to demand Blizzard locks certain zones, making them only available for certain classes/races, as if you level an alt, you are just going through the same content and still paying for it, not getting anything new out of your play experience? I know multiple people that have been playing since Vanilla that are happy about ZA/ZG coming back, as for some it brings back fond memories.. or memories of the mounts they never got. I see it as a nice filler patch while developers work on producing a quality new raid, instead of just throwing out stuff that neither side will be satisfied with. <br />
<br />
Let's take a look at it with something you may understand a little about, food. If I ran a diner and you loved eating at it because of the amazing spaghetti, and knew the normal wait times on it were 20 minutes from ordering before it would be in front of you, that would be cool, right? You were getting what you came and paid for. However, if my diner became increasingly popular and I expanded the menu, and wait times increased by say.. 10 minutes, would you give up on the spaghetti? If I offered a vegetarian sauce, or additional sauces with other meats in them, would you refuse to be a patron at the diner because I was recycling old recipes? Would you picket the building? Spend time to get other diners to not eat there? All because the sauce you once adored, was now coming back with a few different options. I mean seriously, do you get how stupid you sound now? I'm half betting that if you respond to this little scenario that you will say that you would be a patron of my diner for 50+ years, ordering the same thing every time you came in, and things would be just fine, and you would never want to foray into trying something else. <br />
<br />
Again, your lack of knowledge on how businesses actually work astounds me. All of the revenue from one thing, will not recycle back into that. I will argue that Blizzard is smart for development on other projects, and smarter for releasing bits of information about how some of the team responsible for WoW has moved onto them. Nothing will last forever, nothing. There is no way for Blizzard to develop WoW, or any other MMORPG for that matter (or any other game company to try to do the same), with expectations that it will continue on and still be able to attract players and be a viable option in the market until the world goes poof. It would be a shoddy business plan at best. People have a natural tendency to want bigger and better things. As time goes on, Blizzard will stop development of WoW, further down the road, they will cease support of it. Such as many other companies have done. Look at the evolution of Counter-Strike, once a Half-Life Mod... has now evolved into different games, with the popularity of CS 1.6 falling, there are still holdouts in the community that have not opted for CS:S or to move onto another one of Valves FPS games. There will always be relics of the past with people running their own WoW servers, but like my example, large amount of a player base will move onto other things. It's natural. They are developing other projects as a means to keep their loyal customer base loyal and happy and continuing playing their products. Do you think Nintendo has never spent any of their Mario money on development of other things? Did the money from all PS-1 sales just go toward.. what? Oh, right, developing the next generation gaming system. Microsoft must still be using the revenues from the first generation Xbox sales to continue development on them.. oh.. wait.. Much of the revenue from WoW, I assure you, has gone into the development of other Blizzard games. To stomp your feet and try to insist that the revenue from subscriptions completely be directed toward the continued development of WoW, is shortsighted and in fact asking for the company to work itself into the ground. Would you ask that 100% of the money from pets/mounts from the store that have been previously sold be kept toward more development for those items? Instead of going to MAW?</div></div><hr />

ZG and ZA should be in game as they were when they were launched. <br />
Your logic sounds nice... until you realise that now the ENTIRE storyline of WOW has been changed - and still we have MC.. BWL... and other stuff ingame that contradicts the new content. ZG and ZA are no diffrence. Why should the trolls not get new instance like say... the 80-85 levling content ? Why was the troll content removed from players that are playing the orginal game only ? There was nothing wrong with the orginal troll content at all.<br />
<br />
While I do agree with you that throwing money into things does not always make it better - it surely wont get any worse than what Blizzarrd is sending out now in patch 4.1 . I consider ZA and ZG to be a sign of lazyness - arrogance and total insult to the long term playerbase of WOW. Thats why I chancelled my sub the same day I saw 4.1 beeing the next &quot;content patch&quot;. <br />
<br />
Alot of ppl expected more from BLizzard in Cataclysm - they had a chance to update alot of the basic systems of the game. They had money to do it... they had the ppl to do it.... Instead.. they put that effort into another game. That might be acceptable for a normal payed for once game... but its surely is NOT acceptable in a sub based game and Blizzard is feeling that right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, most devs will willingly discuss weaknesses in their system, and look for ways to fix them. The only devs who do not are typically weeded out by other developers very quickly and fired. Software development isn't a &quot;lone wolf&quot; process. You need to work in a team, and take advice from others. Again, you are showing that you have no idea what software development entails.<br />
<br />
Actually, Blizzard is listening to the community. That's why we are getting the content we are receiving. They heard from the community that most guilds haven't progressed as far as they'd like, and that the LFD tool takes too long. You need to recognize that you are part of the minority. <br />
<br />
And you are correct, I have zero idea what is going on at Blizzard. As do you. However, unless you want to post some credentials or development experience, I have worked for several software development firms and I am simply posting my experience. You are free to post your experience as well.<br />
<br />
I have looked at the past before TOC. You conveniently ignored that I played a paladin in Vanilla, when it was pretty much a useless class. I also remember playing Alliance then, and shamans being bringers of death and almost unkillable at times. I remember plenty of buggy instances from all of the expansions. To claim this expansion is any worse than any other is ridiculous and shortsighted, and it makes me seriously wonder if you actually did play back then.</div></div><hr />

Go back to vanilla WoW when your precious original developers were in charge. You got pampered in WotLK when the &quot;interns&quot; were in charge, amusingly enough, with new raid tiers every content patch. Now that they're moving back to the way things were originally, with every content patch not having a raid tier attached to it, you're throwing a hissy fit.<br />

I've seen sources posted of Blizzard speaking in regards to the individuals that have went onto this new project, would you kindly provide sources where they used the terminology that you are? <br />
<br />
I admitted that I have only recently started playing, would my logic or reading comprehension of what has been stated from Blizzard be anymore powerful if I had been playing since Beta? In my previous post, nowhere have I implied how anyone should feel. I stated how I feel about the content that is coming, and reiterated some things that Blizzard has said, one of which you have previously quoted in which they spoke of Firelands. The content you deem as being regurgitated in 4.1, while having stuff removed from it, is still available to play, therefore anyone currently paying for a subscription, is paying for something they already have access to/may have already played, to play it on a different level. Would you also go so far as to demand Blizzard locks certain zones, making them only available for certain classes/races, as if you level an alt, you are just going through the same content and still paying for it, not getting anything new out of your play experience? I know multiple people that have been playing since Vanilla that are happy about ZA/ZG coming back, as for some it brings back fond memories.. or memories of the mounts they never got. I see it as a nice filler patch while developers work on producing a quality new raid, instead of just throwing out stuff that neither side will be satisfied with. <br />
<br />
Let's take a look at it with something you may understand a little about, food. If I ran a diner and you loved eating at it because of the amazing spaghetti, and knew the normal wait times on it were 20 minutes from ordering before it would be in front of you, that would be cool, right? You were getting what you came and paid for. However, if my diner became increasingly popular and I expanded the menu, and wait times increased by say.. 10 minutes, would you give up on the spaghetti? If I offered a vegetarian sauce, or additional sauces with other meats in them, would you refuse to be a patron at the diner because I was recycling old recipes? Would you picket the building? Spend time to get other diners to not eat there? All because the sauce you once adored, was now coming back with a few different options. I mean seriously, do you get how stupid you sound now? I'm half betting that if you respond to this little scenario that you will say that you would be a patron of my diner for 50+ years, ordering the same thing every time you came in, and things would be just fine, and you would never want to foray into trying something else. <br />
<br />
Again, your lack of knowledge on how businesses actually work astounds me. All of the revenue from one thing, will not recycle back into that. I will argue that Blizzard is smart for development on other projects, and smarter for releasing bits of information about how some of the team responsible for WoW has moved onto them. Nothing will last forever, nothing. There is no way for Blizzard to develop WoW, or any other MMORPG for that matter (or any other game company to try to do the same), with expectations that it will continue on and still be able to attract players and be a viable option in the market until the world goes poof. It would be a shoddy business plan at best. People have a natural tendency to want bigger and better things. As time goes on, Blizzard will stop development of WoW, further down the road, they will cease support of it. Such as many other companies have done. Look at the evolution of Counter-Strike, once a Half-Life Mod... has now evolved into different games, with the popularity of CS 1.6 falling, there are still holdouts in the community that have not opted for CS:S or to move onto another one of Valves FPS games. There will always be relics of the past with people running their own WoW servers, but like my example, large amount of a player base will move onto other things. It's natural. They are developing other projects as a means to keep their loyal customer base loyal and happy and continuing playing their products. Do you think Nintendo has never spent any of their Mario money on development of other things? Did the money from all PS-1 sales just go toward.. what? Oh, right, developing the next generation gaming system. Microsoft must still be using the revenues from the first generation Xbox sales to continue development on them.. oh.. wait.. Much of the revenue from WoW, I assure you, has gone into the development of other Blizzard games. To stomp your feet and try to insist that the revenue from subscriptions completely be directed toward the continued development of WoW, is shortsighted and in fact asking for the company to work itself into the ground. Would you ask that 100% of the money from pets/mounts from the store that have been previously sold be kept toward more development for those items? Instead of going to MAW?<br />
<br />
You compareing a diner to a sub based MMO game ? THATS exactly what you know about buisness? And you dare to compare sub based game to a one time buy game that allows server support like CS ? I would agree with you if you were comparing CS to GW2. But you are not.. you are actually compareing a sub based game... game that ppl are paying EXTRA for to a one amount game.... And exactly.. you are comparing those two game like they Developers of a sub based game have NO obligation whatsover to maintain any sort of innovative design work and upgradign of tech for basic systems. Sorry but you just sound insulting.<br />
<br />
Lets take another exmaple of two MMO games.... Guild Wars and WOW... One is pay only with updates MMO - other is a expansion based sub game. Guild Wars 2 is coming out... game that is BUILD on guild wars and will continue to support the ongoing storyline of orginal GW. It is fully updated with new tech - graphics and new innovative systems and events.... <br />
<br />
Then lets compare that to WOW - 6 years on in Cata..... Sub based game that you PAY for EXTRA to maintain a steady and ongoing upgrade to keep up to date with whats going on in the MMO industry. And then you realise WOW isn't doing that with the sub money... And thats simply not acceptable.<br />
<br />
I think you should do abit more research about food, MMOs and other computer games before you talk about it in the same sentance. It shows a total lack of undestanding what a sub based MMO game stands for.</div></div><hr />

Stop selectively picking at peoples arguments to try and defend your points, or learn some reading comprehension. If you are unable to comprehend or even have a basic understanding of some of what I posted above, I think you just need to nod your head and go back to playing whatever game it is now that you have so proudly left WoW and are playing. <br />
<br />
I also do not mean this to sound rude, but from reading your posts, I am assuming that English is not your first language. You cancelled your subscription, you did not chancel it. Also, as per a previous post of yours with how you defined intern, are you insinuating that in professions such as the medical field, doctors are also interns when learning new methods of surgical procedure and technology that others have created? If I were you, I wouldn't trust any sort of doctor, not just Ghostcrawler, as any good doctor will always be learning and researching the newest practices in his field, and be an intern in your eyes, that should not be trusted with anything, leave it up to the pros!</div></div><hr />

<br />
And the people playing the original game only should not be a deciding factor on what people with the newest expansion should be able to experience.<br />
<br />
Who said we needed to be sent back to ZA and ZG ? Thats EXACTLY The point we are making. How naive can you get ? <br />
So you dont think that the entire questline of Cataclysm isn't direclty contraticting the other instances ? You do realise that entrance to BWD is the place where ppl fight NEF in BWL ? PPL not sent where ? <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Go back to vanilla WoW when your precious original developers were in charge. You got pampered in WotLK when the &quot;interns&quot; were in charge, amusingly enough, with new raid tiers every content patch. Now that they're moving back to the way things were originally, with every content patch not having a raid tier attached to it, you're throwing a hissy fit. I did not get pampered in WOTLK - It stared with recycled raidcontent and it ended with one whole year of last tier. Thats how fantastic WOTLK &quot;interns&quot; were doing...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is what Blizzard has always done. What do you think funded Starcraft 2? Vanilla WoW and TBC, that's what. You're bashing Blizzard now for doing what they've always done.<br />
<br />
No - this is exactly NOT what BLizzard has not done before - no matter how often you try to say it. BLizzard is no longer just BLizzard - its Activision/Blizzard. Devs are no longer in charge of their games - Activision is. <br />
<br />
Blizzard has NEVER before run a SUB based MMo game. Comparing a sub based game to a one time payiment game and say this is what BLizzard has always done is a joke. BLizzard has the UNIQUE chance to keep World of Warcraft up to date in EVERY department if they so wanted... They desided not to - and thats exactly what Cata and patch 4.1 is proving. They lost alot of their long term sub base cause of that. And they will loose more with every patch from now on when it becomes more and more obvious that WOW has been put on the shelf... Game of 12 million ppl treated like it can't afford to update its tech.... Thats and insult.<br />

Actually I do not.. PPl are comparing apples and oranges when they compare a normal 1 payment game to a sub based MMO game. This becomes even more obvious when ppl consider it to be perfectly fine that sub money ppl pay for to get to play their character - is taken out of that game and put into another project alongside the developers that have moved on. <br />
<br />
And yes thats why many of the long term WOW player sub based is looking around for a new MMO game. Because you simply do not do such things with a sub based game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What ppl are realising now - and it became very aparent with 4.1 - is that the focus from BLizzard has turned away from WOW into the new project. You might disagree and claim that some ppl are pshyched about recycled ZG and ZA instances. I dont think you will find alot of long term subs that agree with you. <br />
<br />
WOW is taking a nosedive in terms of Innovative game design. Archeology is sort of proof of that. Why ? Where is Path of the Titans ? <br />
I dont start crying when someone ends their posts with namecallings. It just puts their post into right perspective that their goal is just to talk down a &quot;raving lunatic&quot; - that desides to call interns.. interns =)<br />
<br />
Out of curiosity, have you played everything on the PTR? I admit that ZA was recycled, no doubt, but ZG was not. People who judge things before they see them are morons and morons do not deserve to have their opinions paid any attention to. What we’re getting is a new 5 man that uses the same map as ZG, a recycled raid tuned to be a 5 man, and quest content.<br />
<br />
I’m really a bit surprised that people (you) think that a minor patch like 4.1 should light the sky on fire. It isn’t a major content patch, 4.2 was not delayed. The only reason 4.1 has any content at all is to bridge the gap; apparently they don’t want people to be forced into a raiding treadmill for 4.2. If you’re looking for innovation, maybe don’t look for it in minor patches?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whats the point of telling a fish IT is wet? Does it need a towel? <br />
<br />
WOW is not awful - never said that. I just think a game with 12 million sub based should be doing alot better than sending out a conent patch with recycled two dungeons that ppl have already played. <br />
<br />
The rest is a long term issue that Blizzard needs to sort out in the next 1 or 2 years. Titan is rumored to be launched 2013 and thats 1 more WOW expansion away. Blizzard as a company needs to rebuild turst with their long term playerbase - they can not pull another 4.1 and then throw out more PR about TITAN. THey need to show full comitment to WOW.. They are not - and both Cata and 4.1 are showing the lack of it....<br />
<br />
There are many good posts on the official forums from WOW long term fans talking about BLizzard needing to show the same comitment to the game as the players are showing. ATM BLizzard is not and thats why ppl will be looking with intrest on new MMOs coming out in the next 1-2 years... since TITAN is the next big thing anyway from BLizzard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BLizzard have spent close to two months with ZG on PTR as the only content. Most of the time the instance was unplayable. ZA was unplayable until last week cause of issues. Point is that things need to be tested. 4.2 needs public testing and we are not seeing it released in next few weeks - and if not we are into the summer and wont probably see it until mid AUgust. Firelands was delayed. One rewamped 5 man dungeon has been clogging the test servers for 6 months with ZERO focus on testing new and exiting - innovated gaming content. And right now we are on werge of seeing 4.2 delayed even further because of that.<br />

looking at this patch notes i don't think wow is worth it the money for me and i am not going to renew my sub. that ends in a week 95% sure<br />
<br />
I think everyone should do the entire gaming comunity a big favor and skip subbing next 3-4 months until Firelands is out. If not we will just see more of the exact same happen more and more - taking away REAL development time for NEW and innovating things. <br />
<br />
I expect a sub based MMO game to do better than spend 6 months recycling 1 dungeon on a test server. Thats just lazy</div></div><hr />

But i think all this is for good and we all will win if WoW comes to it ends sooner .<br />
I am also not sure if Blizz will keep thier position on MMo market after next year and this is also for good cuz wow killed the creativity in mmo genre.<br />
Its all about making money now and they use 40% of that cash to make the game and all other 60% for advertisment thier shit trying to sell to u: Aion Rift Age of conan WAR ..u call it .<br />
and when we talk about blizz is all about money in a first place too and its that way since very long time ....too bad now they dont have a quality product that wow used to be to back up there philo$ophy .<br />
Dont get me wrong i still like wow and i hope it gets better but thats not what i am seeing to be honest ... less and less efforts has been put into wow .</div></div><hr />

Still not answering my question and acting in an incredibly childish manner about it. How did Blizzard merging with Activision in 2008 affect how WoW worked since 2004?<br />
<br />
<br />
How do you fund your lemonade Stand? With your understanding of funding projects - I think that would be more than enough for you in the next few years <br />
What does lemonade have to do with anything? You made fun of some guy for trying to compare WoW with a restaurant, then you turn around and bring up a lemonade stand. Your hypocrisy is only exceeded by your childish antics.</div></div><hr />

PPl choose what content they do. PPL will probably kill Sinestra one day - but there are alot of other factors that make it very hard to do atm. One of it beeing the fact that you have to do the same content again and there are alot of ppl that simply not bother and chancel sub until next patch. And that means a guild needs to regear more ppl and so on.<br />
<br />
Get a clue what mmoRPG game is about.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is whole patch is based off getting ready for new content.<br />
Theres no other explanation why blizz is letting you get 980 valor a week off heroics.<br />
As a raider, thats means I get my weekly max very easily.<br />
That means you're able to access your tier easier, go through the bosses faster.</div></div><hr />

Infact im not a big fan of the whole turn around the Zandalari are having. It seems ridiculous that the main body of the entire troll race has now decided that following some random, previously unheard of god (can't remember the name, Zog, Zul? Something like that) which has lead them to effectively fully remaking the enimies we destroyed for them. Also Hakkar's little appearance at the end can't be good, he'll probably be making a comeback further down the line.<br />
<br />
Actually, im banking that Zul (or whatever the new Zandalari god is called) is probably an old god or a lieutenant thereof. And Hakkar, is like the child of an old god or something, which means Zul ends up getting the Zandalari to resummon Hakkar, who will appear in another rehashed raid.<br />

Zul is a &quot;Prophet&quot;, probably the dude in the video. He seems to have done away with the Zandalari king to (Unless he IS the king O.o)</div></div><hr />

It amazes me how some folks can't imagine twists in a storyline or characters having a change of hearts from world-changing events.<br />
Just look at the real world and how people act in it! Can you still honestly say you don't understand how someone can change their opinions on the state of their whole races's well-being in the duration of over 6 years and after events that almost destroyed the world?<br />
It took Arthas himself less then 6 years to go from goody-two-shoes paladin to leader of the Scourge.<br />

Well, it amazes me that a whole race would want to bring somebody back that THEY killed because he was going to destroy the world. So, instead of Deathwing, they'd rather have Hakkar do it? <br />
<br />
No, more likely they're being MC'ed or corrupted or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh well, prophet then. Regardless, he seems to have a lot of power and influence over the Troll race. That's also a good point, where's King Rastakhan (spelling?) in all of this? Too many questioned unanswered, and I think it will end up with Zul being an Old God pawn, like they need more of those.</div></div><hr />

As for wanting new content. My server (draka) is behind world wide progression. To be honest I am pretty sure no guild on my server will even kill Sinestra, let alone see her.

The point is to get more healers and tanks doing heroics to reduce the ludricous amount of time that DPS spend in queue, so whatever will work without giving an unfair advantage or breaking the game is acceptable. (Although if Blizzard really wanted to fix the problem, they'd just admit that they over-corrected on 5-man heroics for Cataclysm and institute more nerfs.)<br />

Well in ZG Jin'do is known as the god breaker. So I'll assume they will take the weakened Hakkar and use it in their war. <br />

With that being said, the trailer is awesome &amp; Vol'jin is cool like that.</div></div><hr />

As cool as that cinematic looks it's still pathetic that they are bringing back old instances instead of creating something new. I've had enough of Nefarian, Ragnaros, Hakkar and Zul'jin for years and damn it, I want something new instead.</div></div><hr />

yeah, honestly the old god excuse has become uninteresting and annoying, it's not even surprising anymore when everything gets corrupted by old gods, why can't sargeras rock up and blow them up and finish Azeroth once and for all, at least Sargeras is Win</div></div><hr />
