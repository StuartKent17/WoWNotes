Patch 5.2 Dev Interviews<br />
Another day, another interview. Tonight we take a look at an interview with Dave Kosak, Lead Quest Designer by Buffed.de (http://www.buffed.de/World-of-Warcraft-PC-16678/Specials/WoW-Keine-weiteren-5-Spieler-Dungeons-geplant-Challenge-Szenarien-und-Shaohao-Lore-Interview-mit-Lead-Quest-Designer-Dave-Kosak-1059788/2/).<br />
<br />
Future<br />
<br />
There are no more five man dungeons planned for Mists of Pandaria. (Discussion (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1273149-No-new-5-player-dungeons-in-5-4)) <br />
Garrosh and Varian will show up again in Patch 5.3, with another chapter of Varian's story. <br />
The rewards from the daily quest factions in patch 5.2 were intended to make daily quests feel less mandatory, with the best rewards coming from raid reputation. <br />
More scenarios are coming in future patches. We may see very challenging three player scenarios with pretty good rewards.<br />
Future patches won't make dramatic changes to Azeroth when the war comes back, but there will be small changes to reflect the war going global.<br />
The story of the last Pandaren emperor that cloaked the continent in mists will be revealed at some point in the future. <br />
An animated ebook is coming that tells more of the story of Pandaria and the last emperor, Shaohao.<br />
The story of the Zandalari isn't over yet!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 5.2 <br />
<br />
Isle of Thunder unlocking is faction based and participation based. The unlock speed is based on participation percentage, not population. Doing just one quest is enough to count as contributing for the day. <br />
Most realms will fully unlock the Isle within six weeks, with some doing it slightly faster or slower.<br />
The Isle of Thunder has things like the summonable bosses, rare spawns, chests, Lorewalker objects, and other things to make it more than just a place to go and do daily quests. More things like these will be experimented with in Patch 5.3. <br />
The Tiller's farm worked out well, and we may see more places to interact with every day in the future. <br />
The Troves of the Thunder King scenario is intended to be easy to find a key for at least once a week, with a small chance to find another. <br />
Outdoor bosses, rare spawns, and the Isle of Giants are all ways to encourage players to group up, and we will see more in the future.<br />
The solo scenarios added in Patch 5.2 allow players to experience the Isle of Thunder unlock events even if they were unable to play for a few weeks, but we won't see a lot of these in the future. They are better for special events or skill challenges, such as the final part of the Patch 5.2 legendary quest chain. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Isle of Thunder Participation<br />
Dave Kosak shared (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/311231154315472896) what the percentage of participation for your faction actually means. Some time towards the end of last week US realms stopped unlocking at the same exact rate, so be sure to encourage your faction to do daily quests if you want to keep up!<br />
<br />

Oondasta and Nalak Hotfixes<br />
Groups of 80 to 200 players (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnfPRYbdz8g) have been forming cross realm raids to kill Oondasta, which occasionally caused some realm stability problems. <br />
We’re in the process of implementing a hotfix that will remove players’ eligibility to receive loot from Oondasta and Nalak, The Storm Lord if they’re not on their home realm.<br />
<br />
We think it’s great that encounters like Oondasta have been able to bring back some of the excitement of massive spontaneous outdoor raids. However, with cross-realm groups giving the ability to play with friends on each other’s realms, the amount of people concentrating on a single realm to try to zerg these bosses down can unfortunately cause a number of stability issues, impacting the availability of the game for everyone.<br />
<br />
While Nalak isn’t available yet, we want to preemptively address this so that the first realm to unlock it doesn’t then become the single focus for the rest of the region.<br />
<br />
Here’s the hotfix note that’ll be added to the blog shortly:<br />
<br />
<br />
Players visiting a different realm are no longer eligible to receive loot from Oondasta or Nalak, The Storm Lord.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 5.2 Hotfixes: March 11<br />
Tonight's hotfixes address several issues, such as the 5% drop rate of the Zandalari dino pets (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/69925-zandalari-dinomancer#related:drops-item_!), Throne of Thunder tuning adjustments, AQ exploits, and Blacksmiths making Lightning Steel Ingots (http://www.wowdb.com/items/94111-lightning-steel-ingot) too early.<br />

<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Creatures<br />
<br />
Players visiting a different realm are no longer eligible to receive loot from Oondasta or Nalak, The Storm Lord. A forum thread discussing the reasoning for this change have been created.<br />
Fixed an issue that could cause Oondasta to not award loot to some players.<br />
Fetid Meat Pile now properly lets players that are sufficiently far away to drop out of combat.<br />
Zandalari Dinomancer (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/69925-zandalari-dinomancer) now have a much lower chance to drop the Zandalari Anklerender, Footslasher, Kneebiter, and Toenibbler.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raids, Dungeons, and Scenarios<br />
<br />
All raid bosses now drop the appropriate number of tier tokens for Raid Finder, 10/25-player normal and heroic modes.<br />
Fixed an issue where Luck of the Draw would sometimes be incorrectly applied to Challenge Mode groups.<br />
Throne of Thunder<br />
<br />
Combustion now deals 100% of the player’s damage to Primordius while the player is under the effects of Fully Mutated.<br />
Reduced the health of The Council of Elders for 10-player normal and heroic mode.<br />
Fixed an issue with Durumu the Forgotten where Life Drain's stun was not transferring correctly.<br />
Reduced the health of the Gurubashi, Amani, Drakkari, and Farraki adds on the Horridon encounter.<br />
Iron Qon for 25-player normal and heroic modes had the following change: The amount of damage dealt by Unleashed Flame and number of people needed to trigger Unleashed Flame had been reduced.<br />
Iron Qon for 10/25-player normal modes had the following changes: Shatter damage have been reduced by 20%, damage from Arching Lightning have been reduced by 10%, and Rising Anger stacks more slowly.<br />
<br />
Scholomance<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue where Lilian Voss' Dark Blaze was invisible.<br />
<br />
Temple of Ahn’Qiraj<br />
<br />
The Prophet Skeram and any illusions created during the encounter no longer drop loot or provide reputation when killed. This is a temporary change to address an issue with the encounter.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Battlegrounds<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue with latency near the beginning of a Battleground.<br />
<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
<br />
Blacksmithing<br />
<br />
Creation of Lightning Steel Ingots (http://www.wowdb.com/items/94111-lightning-steel-ingot) now requires at least one of the factions to have unlocked the Thunder Forge.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Saurok Ritualist's Sacrificial Dagger (http://www.wowdb.com/items/94708-saurok-ritualists-sacrificial-dagger) is no longer bind-on-equip (BoE).<br />
<br />
<br />
Bug Fixes<br />
<br />
The Skin of the Saurok disguise in Ihgaluk Crag will no longer cancel Druid Moonkin and Tree of Life forms.<br />
Fixed an issue where Worgen were unable to use Two Forms after crossing into a coalesced zone while in combat.<br />
<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Be sure to read these carefully, as they make note of &lt;span title=&quot;Mage buffs&quot;&gt;upcoming class changes&lt;/span&gt;. <br />
Classes<br />
Also considering buffs to warrior and DK tank DPS. Possible nerfs to dot classes. Nothing extreme. DPS looks good overall (but only 1 week). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/311278786060636160))<br />
DK tank DPS Really? If that's the case please look at Prot Pally.<br />
Prot paladin DPS looks good overall. Is there a specific fight you're referencing? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/311284695402950657))<br />
<br />
How do you feel about absorbs always being chosen over other heals in battle and making Paladin and Priest always on top?<br />
It's just a trait of absorbs. Hots also tend to &quot;heal snipe.&quot; It's one reason meters aren't a great indicator of healing power. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/309796185571459073))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/269-Death-Knight) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/death-knight) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#Y))<br />
Sims aren't end all be all, then are you seeing in practice unholy being much higher than frost? Why more frost specific buffs<br />
Yeah Unholy ended up on top and the goal isn't to make every Frost DK swap. Should be personal preference for 95% of players. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/308791481643192321))<br />

Can we get the LOS requirement dropped from Dismiss Pet? Would help out when terrain in boss rooms traps them<br />
That seems like a reasonable request. We'll discuss it. Counters a PvP strat, but that strat is mostly annoying. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/308743762912370689))<br />
<br />
But the Silencing Shot nerf IS noticed in PVE, especially with any rares/elites that cast heals. How to interrupt now?<br />
There is no encounter in PvE balanced around every player needing to interrupt that often. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/307934622241652736))<br />
<br />
Confused by Diziet interview and hunter class review. Hunters needed a nerf a la spriests but were in a good place in pvp?<br />
Fixing the Stampede bug after launch and nerfing Silencing Shot a little in 5.2 are the only nerfs IIRC. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/310468279917494272))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/272-Mage) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/mage) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#g))<br />
To clear up some confusion, Critical Mass is a 1.3 modifier on live. There is a tooltip bug that makes it appear to be 1.2. Our apologies. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/310090581667893248))<br />
<br />
After a few more days, we now think mage DPS is low. We want to keep parity among mage specs so the buffs will likely be fairly passive. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/311278474507714563))<br />
When will these changes happen? I love arcane, raid leader has me going frost for tomorrows raid. Thank you again for all u do<br />
The intent is before the raid reset / heroics unlock. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/311285889487732737))<br />
<br />
You overdid it destroying Fire &amp; redid it in 5.2 to Arcane. It's galling to see Blizzard surprised Frost is over-represented.<br />
That's not what I said. We like Frost vs. Fire vs. Arcane. We think all 3 are low compared to say lock and hunter. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/311282601568636928))<br />
<br />
I seem to be spamming scorch because of movement issues with the new bosses on ptr, anything new on the way? ;/. Sry to bother<br />
Quickly moving then stopping to cast is generally higher performance than moving all the time and spamming Scorch. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/307934972327628801))<br />
<br />
Speccing Flameglow is boring, there's no visual (and its called flameglow, huh..) It could atleast have a little visual..<br />
It's a passive. The visual would be up 100% of the time. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/310472950342094849))<br />
Can we get an aura to flameglow pls?<br />
It's on always. Do you just want an icon to remind you or do you want to see a visual 100% of the time? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/311284795449675776))<br />
<br />
5.0 fire, 5.1 arcane, 5.2 frost. I feel that when i am comfortable with one spec i have to change every patch since mop releas<br />
My advice overall is to play that you enjoy and not swap constantly based on what some website says. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/310469722049228800))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/imonks.gif Monk (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/341-Monk) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/monk) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#o))<br />
Whats the reasoning behind monk fierce tiger hotfix nerf? I understood the 5.2 nerfs but isn't this too many at once?<br />
We found a last minute bug with our testing related to the lvl 30 talents. It as our mistake unrelated to any performance on live. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/309740532425433088))<br />
Does this mean the 10% damage reduction on stance will be reverted? *Puppy Eyes*<br />
No, we had to add that nerf because their damage was 10% higher than we wanted. My apologies. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/309795839860150272))<br />
Any chance of fixing the bug and reverting to 20%? Could cause problems layer. Balancing around bugs = bad.<br />
The bug was in our testing, not the WW. We caught it too late. You were doing +10% DPS than we intended. Sadface. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/309841577763811328))<br />
The excuse doesn't make sentence, dude. How does lv 30 talents affect dps?? Chi wave?<br />
Try measuring your DPS with and without Chi Wave. What is the difference? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/310074200801046528))<br />
How do want to make WW viable? their dmg is lower than in 5.2! srsly people are massabandoning their monks<br />
Mass abandonment after 2 days also seems like a bit of an extreme reaction. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/310084831356801024))<br />
Maybe, although I'm sure it's crossed the mind of several after your such amusing understanding of balance in 5.2.<br />
Are you saying you have a crystal clear picture of balance after 3 days? Hmm. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/310152085247242240))<br />
I just find the explanations for this &quot;10%&quot; reduction a bit reduntant. But im a fighter and so is my monk!<br />
It's not this simple, but imagine Fierce Tiger had a bug that made it do 10% more DPS than intended. The hotfix was to fix that. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/310475768599814145))<br />

Why the change to the paladin 4pc pvp set to not work with eternal flame?<br />
We wanted to cut down on Holy instants, so we changed the bonus to work with WoG/EG to Flash. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/309795351689322496))<br />

Disc feels functionally much better. Coming back with the DA change is tough but adaptable. Overall, great work.<br />
Glad to hear it. Let's see how it feels in a week or two once everyone has wrapped their head around all the PvP changes. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/309317737497370625))<br />

Using totems while silenced is annoying ok but to be blanket silenced every 15 seconds isn´t?<br />
The point of silences is to counter things, especially heals and defenses. We don't like uncounterable things. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/307938015609757696))<br />

As an Affy Warlock, having Haunt tied into the Soul Shard system feels clunky. It felt better as a cooldown.<br />
We like Haunt. Concerned that Soul Swap consumes all available shards though which means less for other things. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/308791010014683136))<br />
<br />
Just curious, how's the reaction to the Warlock quest been? I've spent about 20 hours wiping on Kan, feels overwhelming atm<br />
Overall, I'd say it was this. Players who can't beat him: Please nerf. Players who managed to beat him: Please don't! (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/310475512281718784))<br />
<br />
Any worse on whether Kanrethad might receive some kind of nerf? I've given all I've got, and I just can't do it as-is <br />
Maybe someday. For now, the fight is more about execution and using all your tools than DPS. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/310467788001140737))<br />

Why did warriors get such a nerf in 5.2? Why is deadly calm gone? Why such a hate for dps warriors?<br />
Did you really find Deadly Calm fun? I felt we added it in a weak moment. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/309317008674136064))<br />
<br />
Did you guys just not care to put a prot war explanation in the class reviews?<br />
We made almost no changes. We adjusted their scaling a little to avoid high Vengeance craziness. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/310468822266163201))<br />

The Daily Blink - Donate, and Buff a Mage in Need<br />
The Daily Blink (http://www.thedailyblink.com/2013/03/donate-and-buff-a-mage-in-need/) came up with a new way to help out mages after the devastation brought by Patch 5.2. Let's just say it has a quick effect (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/311280140430753795)...<br />

<br />
The majority of people in the raid have to be on your server; let's say you have 10 people from your server. If you invite 11 people from another server, you will be CRZ'ed to their server.</div></div><hr />

Because when it's in intended CRZ enabled zones, the resources and questing is designed with that player volume in mind.<br />

Pandaria is NOT actually CRZ-enabled, in that you see people from other realms openly. You only see them if someone invites them to their group and they hop to your server.<br />

Killing optional bosses is not something that is set-in-stone requirement. Whats more, it has never been the case that Blizzard will just kill a boss for you, SOME effort on the part of the players has always been required, even for stuff like Archavon. I would wager that, if you can drum up the interest, you can get Oondasta down on your server, maybe not this week or next - maybe a year down the road - but he will eventually go down.</div></div><hr />

Tier 6 spells got destroyed, an already nerfed 3 times spec (fire) got a pyro nerf wich means less ignites - less combustion = BIG nerf and on top of that, LB spreads are gone.

Blizzard got smarter, they found scenarios and LFR to be a lot more useful to make. Honestly? you really want to run 2 troll 5-mans for the next 6 months? Even on their best patches, they released only 3 dungeons which got boring very fast.

Why would they rotate already. We have only done these for 6 days. It will probably be 2-3 months until the next non-raid patch.<br />

<br />
Who the heck runs dungeons every day? Not sure if you noticed, but there are a LOT of ways to earn VP, if you choose to do only one thing, then that is your decision. I cap VP on two toons every week and I only run maybe 4 heroics per week total, and that is only if the CTA bag is up for tanks. LFR, scenarios, dailies, weekly quests (150 VP for the new one).. any of those things ring a bell? But thankfully there are still people who think heroic dungeons are the only way to get VP, otherwise I wouldn´t be getting my CTA bags for carrying them.</div></div><hr />

I know, these obvious anti-burnout solutions boggle my mind too at times.<br />
<br />
So you want them to create new heroics. but put them in the same pool as the ones we have.. which means they are going to drop 463 ilvl items and be built for players having ilvl 440ish?<br />
<br />
yeah, that will be fun and exciting for players who have ilvl 502 from LFR. Why even build them, they will get destroyed so fast nobody will be able to tell they are new dungeons at all.<br />
<br />
Not to boggle your mind, but the ´separate pool´ was required because the newer heroics were more difficult than the older ones. ie.. players with ilvl 440 wouldn´t be able to handle the new ones.<br />
<br />
So pick your poison..... you either have the newer dungeons be a challenge for players with ´todays´ gear, which means they are separate queue... or else you have the new heroics in the same queue as the older ones, which means they must be doable for people at 440 ilvl, and therefore absolute faceroll for people with 500ish ilvl.<br />
<br />
here is a better solution.. sprinkle in scenarios, LFR, daily quests, weekly quests in order to get your VP.<br />

I'll wait and see how much they buff mages before passing judgement. They were overnerfed, so a correction is in order. Let's see if they get it right or overdo it.<br />
<br />
They weren´t overnerfed.. they are fine now. The problem is that now you have a bunch of bad players who jumped on the bandwagon last tier not being able to get close to the theoretical numbers they should be able to do..... because they are bad players.<br />

It has happened that way in the past. It appears that Blizzard overnerfs something, but after a few weeks those FOTM mouthbreathers will jump to a new class and then mages will magically start to pull higher dps simply becasue the bad players are no longer playing that class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah, that will be fun and exciting for players who have ilvl 502 from LFR. Why even build them, they will get destroyed so fast nobody will be able to tell they are new dungeons at all.<br />
<br />
Not to boggle your mind, but the ´separate pool´ was required because the newer heroics were more difficult than the older ones. ie.. players with ilvl 440 wouldn´t be able to handle the new ones.<br />
<br />
So pick your poison..... you either have the newer dungeons be a challenge for players with ´todays´ gear, which means they are separate queue... or else you have the new heroics in the same queue as the older ones, which means they must be doable for people at 440 ilvl, and therefore absolute faceroll for people with 500ish ilvl.<br />
<br />
here is a better solution.. sprinkle in scenarios, LFR, daily quests, weekly quests in order to get your VP.<br />

They weren´t overnerfed.. they are fine now. The problem is that now you have a bunch of bad players who jumped on the bandwagon last tier not being able to get close to the theoretical numbers they should be able to do..... because they are bad players.<br />

And see this is the only reason I kibitz and whine. Hunters were overnerfed but no one cares because hunters. We got a minimal buff to one spec and mages got nerfed back to earth with the other classes and now its being considered too much that they are only topping the rest of us DPS by a bit?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are aware that the system can lock dungeons in a pool because of missing item level? So for example: they can tune the new dungeons to 490 and put them in with the 5.0 ones. <br />
Everyone below that point will only get 5.0 dungeons. <br />
Everyone above that point will get 5.0 and 5.2 dungeons.<br />
<br />
Maximum randomness and 5.0 dungeon folks still get the chance of a raider carrying them through.<br />
<br />
The forum goers would still whine and there would be a few jerks that QQ and leave the high level dungeons b/c they could take longer, but we shouldn't design around those people.<br />
<br />
<br />

I am a raider. Why on earth would I want to faceroll scenarios and daily quest (beyond exalted) mobs with my raid gear? It's not the content I want to play.<br />
I hate scenarios. Not only are their rewards pitiful for the time invested, they also are extremely annoying. I am a CLOTH DPS. I DON'T WANT TO TANK mobs because the other DPS are blue/green and we have not even a chance of playing aggro-pingpong.<br />
<br />
LFR is okay, I guess... at least I can toy around with alternate specs on different encounters while getting my VP.<br />
<br />
For the record: As Shadow, apart from the trinkets, the valor rewards are pretty crappy. So I probably won't even bother with capping them this time around.<br />
<br />
<br />
They weren´t overnerfed.. they are fine now.<br />
I'm a shadow priest and I think they hit the mages a little too hard. Esp when you think about that many ToT encounters aren't exactly mage-friendly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Make new 5 mans that drop ilvl 490 item. (Slightly higher than the 5.2 LFR requirement.)<br />
2. Add them to the 5.0 pool of 5 mans for everyone whose ilvl is high enough for them. (ilvl 460?)<br />
3. Let the old 5 mans drop that gear as well.<br />
<br />
And now the twist:<br />
<br />
4. Scale everybody's ilvl down to 440 in the old 5 mans.<br />
<br />
You could even limit point 3 to LFD runs, so that people who want the original items for mogging can stil get them.</div></div><hr />

We sure as hell don't have 40 heroic raiders. Seems like Blizzard wants us to transfer to actually kill this boss ;P!<br />
<br />
You can still kill him using crz you just wont get loot. If its like Galleon you can still use a coin roll though. So all you really need to do is find some crz friends on high pop servers to inv you.</div></div><hr />

Why would I want the new dungeons to be challenging? The old ones aren't and never were. You're thinking of challenge modes. I'll go in there when I want a challenge (and I do). I don't want a challenge when I'm capping vp, I want in and out in 15 mins. I want to take my raid gear and blow through them. It would be more fun for me to have a bit more variety of the caves I'm blasting through. And yes there are alternatives to dungeons to cap. I, and based on the queue times a lot of others prefer dungeons. I don't want to deal with the headache of LFR. Scenarios are hollow and empty and just not fun to me. I like to tank, I like going into dungeons with friends. I don't want to do dailies, this is an mmo not a single player game.<br />
<br />
So again, you don't need a separate queue, you don't need updated loot. The raiders who do their daily heroic right now aren't going in there for gear, why would they need to for new dungeons? You make them drop 463, problem solved. I get 80vp and some rep in a new place, yay.</div></div><hr />

We want the dot specs to do well in multi-dot scenarios, but Affliction, Demonology and Shadow were doing too well on multi-dot fights and are still quite competitive on non-multi-dot fights. Balance druids, so far, are where we want them to be.<br />
