Yes, I said Patch 4.2 and not 4.1. It was confirmed in a blue post (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/161923/42-justice-point-gear).<br />
The amount of recolors vary for each class, I only used the ones actually used on items to try to minimize confusion. <br />
The sets are previewed on humans because they have perfect proportions and are the best way to display all the pieces of an armor set. <br />

Hunter set is pretty neat, as well :D Paladin set reminds me of.... a Hawk, maybe? I think it's the helmet that makes me think that...<br />

Most of the rest are pretty run of the mill, except the warrior helm. Not sure how I feel about that, lol. Might need to see it in-game.</div></div><hr />

Sigh...yup, you sure said it man, offering us new season sets in the same design direction they set out in WotLK of having a single smith of some sort gradually upgrading your base armor as the seasons go on instead of just recoloring PvE sets like they did when arena was released. Damn those uncreative bastards.<br />

Anyway, the DK set has 10 mouths on it...TEN, and the Warrior helmet seems like it would be awful painful to wear (why use something that sets your face on fire?).</div></div><hr />

I feel as if (this isn't a self-needy QQ) the hunter helm would look a hell of a lot more fitting on a rogue. I mean c'mon. I'm really really sick of the whole head-scarf dealio that Blizzard have a hard-on for with rogues since Cata. Yes it's unique and original. No, that doesn't mean we actually like it.<br />
<br />
Other than that, the warrior set will keep them warm and snug inside through all those Ice Lances and Chains of Ice, and I ~think~ I like how it looks on the whole. I think. Being on a human (which makes any set look about half as cool as it really is) and with the full frontal view point, it's hard to give a verdict on the helm. I bet it looks a lot better from the sides. The point still remains though; That's not good armour. That's setting your own face on fire.</div></div><hr />

Pretty much confirms how the Deathwing fight will go. You'll need a PvPer in the group, and you have to get Deathwing to eat them. All the spikes on the PvPers armor will tear up Deathwing's throat and he'll bleed to death internally.</div></div><hr />

The shaman set is obviously inspired by the Mage's Tier 10 set - with more spikes! The paladin looks like a weird chicken and the death knight /sigh too many mouths...<br />
<br />
Lich King's armor had many mouths and still I would like to have that one on my DK! Its not so bad! :)</div></div><hr />

Damn those uncreative bastards.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the DK set has 10 mouths on it...TEN, and the Warrior helmet seems like it would be awful painful to wear (why use something that sets your face on fire?).<br />
<br />
They really should learn design from our eastern friends. Cause blizz fails at it:<br />

<br />
Again...sssssiiiiiiiiiiggggggggghhhhhhhh. PvP gear is made by one dude in the world of Azeroth for each class, it does NOT come from Dragon nipples. The guy designed one set for you, then as you get better and progress through seasons, he gets better and upgrades your gear. Eventually, when you reach the high point of your PvP skill at the end of the expansion, he will have provided you with the most sick-with-it-pimpalicious-thugnificent-up-beat gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you serious? Those designs have nothing to do with wow &quot;cartoony-big shoulder&quot; style.<br />
Always remember one big, important thing: The gear in wow is supposed to be colorful, with big massive plates, lightning, fire and stuff, so you can quickly recognize the item lvl of your opponents on the first sight!<br />
<br />
Plus, if all equipment were extremely intricate and full of detail, not only would be impossible to play the game (for the memory requirement), but also, most of the detail would be lost without anyone even noticing. Like it happens with games like lineage and such.<br />
<br />
Anyway, some of these designs are quite silly, especially the warrior and the warlock XD</div></div><hr />

Every class looks a little bit different AND has different colors. Well this isn't all. Every class has different details. <br />
Best of all it doesn't lool excactly like the old sets and its not like the grad crusader set.<br />
With the wotlk grad crusader set every class had nearly excactly the same look. How awfull was that?<br />
<br />
Now everyone could look different and the set doesn't look like normal cloth you could by in supermarked.<br />

Also, I'm just happy it's not re-skinned tier sets like when they first introduced arena. IMO the designs have only gotten better and more original in terms of arena. <br />
<br />
The only set I dislike is the Warlock, unfortunately my main is a warlock D:<br />

Do you really think that Blizzard is out of ideas?<br />
<br />
It's nonsense...<br />
<br />
It seems to me that they try to create news concepts to see people's reaction, and for me: It's awesome.<br />
<br />
All the sets are like an evolution of the previous season, but way more epic! They don't look the same, again, there is a concecpt behind them and in my opinion it's cool, because in the future we can associate the set with the period within the game, and I'm fine with that.<br />
<br />
Btw, the hunter set... I want it! Now! And i would love to use it on pve instead of some murloc skin... =P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snes</div><div class="date">2011-03-06, 09:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Same useless forum comments as always. One person thinks they come up with a clever comment like conehead and the rest of the lemmings parrot what they said without realizing that it's not even remotely tapered enough to be considered conical. To the guy that said hunter has a robocop eye;<br />
a)robocop had no such eye (hopefully you meant terminator)<br />
b)the robocop parrot was from when the current season's sets were previewed and was about the warrior helm.<br />
<br />
-Paladins: You had a pink crystalforge set ONCE; GET OVER IT, nobody feels sorry for you anymore. The rest of your sets aren't bad.<br />
<br />
<br />
-Anyways, some of the sets might be incomplete (the warrior helm looks like the bottom might still be getting fleshed out?). As far as texture work goes, ALL the sets are pretty decent in that area (particularly the shaman, pali, druid and DK sets). The colour schemes overall aren't too bad, although I think the priest ones are still a little bland. Was sort of hoping the rogue helms would keep the darkness; although this could still happen since 4.2 isn't even being tested yet. Warrior set probably looks better on other races.<br />
<br />
-Overall I like the DK and hunter sets the best and rogue the least (at least for now). Before you complain, compare these sets to the 2nd season wrath ones (oh wait, people just simply complain). If this is how good they look now, I can only imagine how awesome they will be the next season and the season(s) after that.<br />
<br />
-To the person saying they should take inspiration from eastern MMO's (insert armor set resembling gundam wing here); it would be nice if WoW could handle that. WoW is running on and EXTREMELY old engine; even WARCRAFT III used it, and as such they are really, really LIMITED in what they can do with it. They probably have alot of ideas that WoW simply can't handle. Eventually, the game will need a new engine and then the graphics can improve.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Secondly: It's pretty evident why there's no &quot;dye&quot; system in WoW, it's because blizzard would have to actually put some time and effort into making different art for armor sets instead of designing one PVP and one PVE per class and hovering over it with a &quot;paint bucket&quot; tool.<br />
<br />
Third: Boub, my man, I'll agree with you on the human female model... but what do men look like where you're from? I ask because if you think the human male model looks perfect, you must live amongst overweight, mutant, steroid freaks. Like it or not, Male Belfs have the best male model to show off armor detail. They actually have proper shaped forearms, thighs, ankles, and feet, and thus don't stretch out the textures. Just sayin' :P</div></div><hr />

I got Cata for Christmas, installed it, reupped my account (that was put on hold til I got Cata) and played less than a month before I just stopped playing altogether again. That said, I still frequent mmo-champion every so often to see the updates on how the game is going. <br />
<br />
I have nothing to add on the armor sets since I'm not playing right now (and don't know if I'll ever start back up again, HELLO DIABLO 3!), but I just wanted to say that whoever did that pic of Grom (my favorite character in all of WoW lore) is badass. I instantly made it my background as soon as I saw it. Night Elves' bodies strung up, impaled heads, Grom rallying his hardened warriors and tell me that's not a kickass sashimono. <br />
<br />
This takes me back to the hardcore, unstoppable juggernaut that was the origin of the Horde; the reason I picked Horde when I started playing WoW the first year it came out. Flawless!<br />
<br />
Edit: I'd also like to add that those puny weapons cannot harm him. (referring to the feeble elven arrows their archers shot into Grom's leg)</div></div><hr />

<br />
DK set is pretty bad ass too. All the other sets are pretty decent, those two are just (imo) the best of the bunch. Not sure how I feel about the warrior helm, its different. And there is something off about the warlock set, perhaps just the helm. It just seems like they should be darker.<br />
<br />
Also, I am one who actually likes the direction that blizzard has taken towards pvp set looks, adding a bit more badass-ness each season. They did it a lot better in cataclysm because all sets started out looking pretty badass and they are just added to that. lol @ wotlk beginning season pvp gear. I do however wish blizzard would go back to alliance and horde having different pvp sets.</div></div><hr />

as always, dks get some cool skull-themed gear. Too bad for rogues, mages, priests and shamas, which gear has no real theme of the particular class. <br />
Interchanging them would prolly go unoticed. <br />
Why paladins keep getting these weird sets, I have no idea. Like the t10 burning skull thing, then t11 stone/gem thing, and now a chicken?<br />
Why not make some kind of shiny templar-thing that has both warrior and priest/munk properties, like the t2?</div></div><hr />

Dont push Boub too much or we will be getting dwarves or dead gnomes as our new models!<br />

<br />
Oh, &lt;gasp&gt;, my, &lt;wheeze&gt;, god. &lt;rolls on the floor, holding her sides&gt;<br />
<br />
Ahahaha, I feel so SORRY for you guys! Ahahahaha. This gear is atrocious!<br />
<br />
The DK stuff looks like some plastic kiddy Halloween mask you find in the Wal-Mart discount isle! Ahhhhhhhhahahahhaa, it looks so crappy!<br />
<br />
The Hunters are like Skeletors from the year 2020 or something, and that cheap-ass perma-glare? rofl!<br />
<br />
Not sure about Priest...it's sort of Roguey...but mainly they're keeping out of the line of lawl-fire. They're pretty neutral without being too boring. But shit, any set of gear is better than the kiddie-sized-pools attached to tier now. (PvP or not.)<br />
<br />
I can't...I can't even...I don't even know what to say for Paladins. I think we should really just let them reroll for free. And if you think this only affects PvPers, 90% of armor is recycled not only through tiers, but between PvE/PvP, too. Oh, lord, I am so glad I dropped my Paladin. I'd be ashamed to wear that armor anywhere. Oh, wait, maybe that's the point! Maybe, since Paladins are so worthless and dislawlpellable, the uncontrollable laughter of their opponents (only serving to distract them long enough for the Paladin to leave the BG/Arena in shame) is the only weapon they have left. Ehehehe. (Edit: I just looked at them again... Wittle Hawky-poos...ahahahahahahahahaha)<br />
<br />
Rogue is boring, plain, dull. Uninspired and has no clear influence. I guess the most we could say is 'yay, air wisps'?<br />
<br />
Mages are using the exact same robe pattern they've been using for 5 years.<br />
<br />
Idk what happened with Warrior. All I can say is you have to be pretty fucking badass to replace your entire face with molten lava.<br />
<br />
Druids look like holy Warlocks. Dunno what they're doing there.<br />
<br />
Shamans look like a mix between DKs and Warlocks... Confusing...<br />
<br />
Warlocks look like Warriors in the most badass dress ever to grace a Warrior's legs. Also, green flame. Yay...green flame...again.<br />
<br />
Okay, so, I;ve deciphered the theme for season 10.<br />
<br />
DISTRACTION! <br />
<br />
Distraction through humiliation, laughter, or plain 'ol switch-a-roony'n. No one will ever suspect that Warrior thing to DoT you, or that glowing Priest-type to...I guess Cyclone...maybe Typhoon...I don't know what Druids do these days when not in a form or dead. The laughter after seeing a Paladin only to turn around and see Skeletor? They'd surely all die from lack of air!<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, man, I sure do love my daily jollies from these here 'updates'.... Good stuff, Blizzard...good stuff.</div></div><hr />

How can you not have got the idea of this yet? The PvP tiers are meant to be like that. They keep the same theme while 'improving' so it's actually as if you're progressing in the ranks.<br />

Blizzard spends there time on PVE sets because the majority of people play that. PVP is considered a side thing in WoW so they don't spend as much time on everything.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard, plz put some effort into designing armor sets. These look the same as the past few seasons. <br />
We're they done by a 5 year old with crayons?? Spend some money ffs and less colours, seriously, less is better. <br />
Really disappointing.</div></div><hr />
