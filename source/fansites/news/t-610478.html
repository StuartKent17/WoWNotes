A lot of the existing quests are still being tweaked. We also have plans to do a few more at the end to make the transition to good old EP a little less jarring. We even have a new Ebon Hold that is a little smaller and easier to navigate. One of the best parts of WoW should be even better by the time we go live. If you haven't spent much time in Northrend, many of the quests there are of this caliber with equally interesting mechanics. It's hard to compress as many into such a great story as the DK start zone though. The good news is that some of the plot threads started in Acherus extend up into Northrend....

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid<br />
We have no plans to implement a &quot;Dire Cat&quot; form at this time. &quot;Dire Bear&quot; exists for the sole purpose of upgrading the Feral Druid's armor value to match the Warrior/Paladin etc. (Druids get no shield) We do, however, intend to allow Druids to be able to use items and enchants with procs in forms, which I believe will work in the next beta build (don't hold me to it though). (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=8202533456&amp;postId=82016109208&amp;sid=1#8))<br />
I think what Kalgan meant was that we intend to do different texture variances for Druid forms, including Cat form. Which is true, though not sure how soon we're going to get that. They may come from a repeatable quest, or through inscription. Regarding the &quot;Feral Range Bug,&quot; that really is not a bug. Have a Warrior, Rogue or any melee class play without using a snare and you'll encounter the same issue. The issue is that the server and client are not sync. When you try to do damage to the target, while your client shows him on your screen, the server disagree's and gives you an error. Snares help alleviate the problem, which is what we're giving Feral Druids in the form of &quot;Infected Wounds&quot; for the expansion. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=8202533456&amp;postId=82016109682&amp;sid=1#11))<br />
I just had a chat with our programmers and we do have some new tech for WOLK intended to help solve the melee range issue. The server will try to &quot;predict&quot; the range between you and your target, which we hope will make the issue less evident. This has not yet been implemented in beta, but I'll let you know when we do finally put in the change.

When your pet gains a level, it will automatically gain a new rank of Growl if one is available at that level. The only thing you really need to manage is which talents to choose... and keeping your spore bat fed and happy. You don't learn skills from (disposable) beasts any longer, and the only thing to do at the Pet Trainer is untalent your pet. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=8202274213&amp;postId=82016380798&amp;sid=1#3))<br />
We didn't want hunters to have spend a big chunk of talent points just to get pet resistance up to where it is in Burning Crusade. So pets will have some amount of inherent resistance. We're not sure how much that will be yet, but it should be enough that your pet doesn't feel fragile. If you want a truly magic-resistant pet, you can top it off with talents. For now at least the lower ranks of the old resistance skills are just free like Growl and Cower. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=8202274213&amp;postId=82017118274&amp;sid=1#6))<br />
There are talents in all 3 pet trees that you can invest in if maintaining happiness is a problem (or just annoying) for you. We're also trying to give you a few more options to keep your pet alive, such as more Avoidance and reduced spell damage, and even more ways to heal your pet. Of course you can always choose to focus directly on more damage and hope your pet survives long enough to make good use of it. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=8202616826&amp;postId=82015908055&amp;sid=1#3))<br />
Think of your pet bar as just shortcuts to your spellbook. It doesn't really matter if an ability is on the bar or not. It can be cast or autocast directly from the spellbook, and unfortunately all new abilities start with autocast defaulted on. This is something we might be able to fix, but in the meantime, peek at your pet's spellbook whenever it gains a level to make sure nothing has changed. Cower can surprise you, because it/si something a lot of players passed on before -- understandably, because even if effective it's not a very fun thing to spend points on, which is why we just give it away now.

We haven't done a major pass on threat generation yet for any of the classes. We realize it was very easy in BC for hunters to pull aggro off of their pets. You can probably tell from some of the pet talents (including the ones that just grant more pet dps) that we want pets to be able to hold their own threat against a hunter. This is especially true when it's just you and Bitey out on your own, but ideally a tanking pet with the proper spec will be an effective offtank for 5-player instances, or even a main tank under some circumstances (say a group quest perhaps).

We'll be removing the imposed cooldown on Circle of Healing in an upcoming beta build. We'll experiment with the ability having no cooldown, but it's still possible we may decide it needs it. We are indeed concerned with the impact AOE heals such as Circle of Healing, Chain Heal etc. have in endgame raiding, but we haven't decided the best way to address the issue.

No there will be no dire cat form (but just go berserk and there's your very dire cat form) As form model, it is said that you'll be able to change your appearance with inscription or some other source. It'll most probably be true with the bear too if you can change de cat appearance. Although you'll have to admit that the one and only form that really really need to change is the tauren cat form. Of course, having your bear ending it's constant drewling would be nice too, as a change of the aquatic form, but first that damn cat form.</div></div><hr />

Lots of things have been broken for years, and many things tweaked throughout TBC, and they also still don't work that well. So I'm doubting Blizzard will make any drastic changes to the class to benefit it.</div></div><hr />

I thought that was because we don't make free tables for random people after they charge several hundred gold for the tomes needed to learn the highest ranks of food and water, so we can pay more gold to even learn the spell that requires reagents to cast? &lt;breathes in&gt; That and random portals to Theramore.<br />

a. dont be lazy and fly, take a boat, whatever. you're paying for convenience and for mages to stop whatever they were doing to cater to your needs.<br />
<br />
b. you fail to note, didnt mention about buffing AI, which would be the spell your poor analogy is trying to compare.<br />
<br />
c. impressive dps, where we're outdps'd by a lot of classes? ok.. our CC is nice, you got me there. Dont say we're partially a utility class.. by that stretch all classes are part utility in some way. We were meant to be a dps class. RTFM.<br />
<br />
d. i doubt that, my impression has been rogues/hunters.. but to each their own i guess. We complain so much because there ARE issues that just are NOT being addressed. Even in WWI, they talked about frostfire bolt... a spell.. vs everyone else's talents.<br />

They have BY FAR the worst survivability of all classes in the game and therefore expect to be compensated with raw damage.<br />
<br />
Right now even when we play perfectly in raids there are still destro-locks (whose survivability AND mana efficiency is exponentially better than mages) doing ~30-40% more dps than us who only have to click one button where we are either weaving scorch/fireball rotations or arcane blast/frostbolt rotations. <br />
<br />
Mages, the supposed &quot;kings of AOE,&quot; have not been able to compete in this category since the advent of seed of corruption.<br />
<br />
And did someone just say polymorph was a perfect CC? Because last time I checked it heals the enemy, is dispellable, breaks on any damage, etc, etc, etc.<br />
<br />
Not a QQ, just pointing out some reasons why mages are complaining (and rightfully so). I absolutely LOVED playing my mage pre-TBC (rolling insane ignites was incredibly fun), but abandoned him for my spriest very quickly after the release of BC and couldn't have been happier with that class.<br />

They took 1 mage to the Kil'jaeden kill, not the entire raid from start to end. Yes I wish they could have taken more, but for first kills where you need to get things perfect, I can understand the reasons. Later kills where you can start to flesh out the group may have more, who knows.</div></div><hr />

<br />
simply put; you dont deserve to do the dps that rogues do.<br />
<br />
you have far too much raid utility that it wouldn't be balanced and 80% of ranged dps would be mages.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">siempel</div><div class="date">2008-07-24, 03:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Excluding very rare encounters like Muru and Majordomo where you need more than one polymorph, I can't think of a single reason to bring more than one mage to a raid. It only takes one mage to buff AI and set up tables. Other than that it's far more beneficial to bring ranged dps that synergize with eachother and that do MORE DPS.<br />
<br />
Edit: And there is no way in hell mages should do as much dps as rogues. They should just be ON PAR with other pure dps ranged classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do however think mages dps should be brought to that of warlocks and mages, but not more than.<br />
<br />
<br />
A: Most I'd charge would be someone brings their own portal rune, some people tip, which is fine, tho' most requests I see in trade I skip due to being on an alt and busy.<br />
<br />
B: Yes, I do realise that, and yet do you need to spend several hundred gold on both, (Spirit requires a talent spell afterall), in order to then learn a spell that requires double your normal reagent cost?<br />
<br />
C: Potentially. That can be shut down fast by a large number of classes. However my concerns with mages don't stem from PvP. Tho' one point about perfect CC: It heals the mob used on. Shackle Undead, altho restricted to undead mobs (Poly needs Humanoids or beasts/critters), doesn't heal, the mob doesnt move, (Into AoE effects for example), and can be cast over a current application, (Same with poly).<br />
<br />
D: Guess that one comes down to personal experience. Most of the younger players I've met are Hunters due to the easier nature of play. Followed closely by Rogues. From the people I know on server, Mages actually number the most infrequent class I see. Mages played as a &quot;Main&quot;, I know 4 from the raiding group I'm in, and perhaps half a dozen in the guild I'm in? Someone I know actually hates playing their Hunter now due to the bad rep the class has going with them from people. Case I can use from yesterday: Hunter in AV, Aimed Shot pulling Drek repeatedly, and FD'ing to avoid the fight. Got to love a Hunter that FDs the moment things look bad and causes a wipe, however.<br />
<br />
Now, people can point out issues there are with their classes, I know there are some with the two main classes I play, (Fire mage and Elemental Shaman), I will mention these when additional issues come up, or new abilties are thrown in for other classes that just increase the already existing problems. People will more than likely go with the &quot;QQ&quot; reply, because that seems to be the more common response on WoW forums. Some people even see this as the &quot;right way&quot; to reply, likely because it is so frequent. You can call the issues I bring up with the classes I pay to play as &quot;QQing&quot;, if you want, but so far I've been polite in how I've typed up my posts, I've not gone out my way to aggrevate people intentionally, and if needed, I can methodically detail the issues which concern me. The problems then lie in getting other people to understand them. Anyone can complain issue X isn't helping them do function Y. But looking at the situation and trying to see why and what they are trying to do helps you get a better idea to respond with than &quot;QQ moar&quot;. Yes some ideas will be silly, as they will overpower the class, but as I've pointed out, the issues in regards to Mages and Shaman are ones that have been mentioned frequently, by a lot of players, non-mage playing ones included.<br />
<br />
I'd be fine with being brought to damage values as warlocks and &quot;?&quot; Not sure what the 2nd class you were meaning was. But it's not just about doing the damage, I'd like to last a bit longer, both in health and mana, look at the reason locks are taken to Kil;jaeden, Nether Protection for the various attacks. Mages? We get 2 school wards, a shield that eats mana and a Immune button that has a 5min CD. Also, a threat reset with a 5 Min CD and a 5s activation time, that can be broken horribly while waiting.<br />

Whereas a Warlock can bring Healthstones, Soulstone a raid member, summon people if required, enslave demons, banish them too, use a single spell for DPS that has a smaller cast time than Fireball yet land larger hits with it, STA buff for a group if needed, and have a small degree of self healing.<br />

Pre-bc they'd take only the bare needed locks for curses just like they take only the bare needed mage now then. <br />

Mages can still get buffed and if they do fall behind majorly I'd expect some buffs to come their way.<br />
<br />
The point now is you at least NEEDED those Warlocks for something. You need one Mage per raid. We've been bitching about this since BC was released. Nothing happened, and they're very quiet about our coming changes.</div></div><hr />

So, big fan of Mount Hyjal then I see, and Illhoof tanking, and Solarion trash, and Destro locks are not squishier than Mages. Locks have more HP, and a sensible player won't go button mashing mad and over shoot the MT on threat. Still seen it happen tho with others.<br />

<br />
ShS to get close to your target, Crippling poison to slow them if they blink and ShS is on CD. Deadly throw or whatever it's named for again slowing movement speed to catch up with.

Mage pvp? Do tell. This should be good. In my opinion, mages are what most classes should be like. You have to play well to do well. You have so many tools to do well in arenas, and if you're complaining that poly heals the target, you're not doing it right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shatter shield is nothing but survival against all the cool stuff melees get (in wotlk) and frostfire bolt is only interesting for elementals ..and I am one - never asked for something like that - ...and how many elemantals are there/will there be?<br />
<br />
Assume 50% will use FFB. How many Rogues will use dismantle/fan of knives? ALL OF THEM and that goes for all the classes. <br />
<br />
Another instant - boring, a hot fart - bullshit, A STUN(1.5sec cast only angainst frozen targets) - don't want that<br />
<br />
Thats a ZERO out of five! I don't want any of that. Why not address the Mana Problem? DPS? Some COOL new stuff?<br />
<br />
think about Thunderstorm...compared to a stun?! 1.5sec cast frozen target WTH!<br />
<br />
Introducing 2 new ways to freeze targets is like reducing the mages PVP to spam Icelances...and I hate that<br />
Mage suck in 2v2 so they give Shaman,DK and I believe Hunter freezing stuff so again &quot;balanced&quot; cause of LanceSpam.<br />
<br />
Elemantals will never be able to compete with Fire/arcane for PvE nor with Frost for PvP ... if Blizz wants to buff it, they should let lower tier Talents unlock new effects (Fire/Frost - crosswise) <br />
<br />
Also you have to assume that theres something wrong with the class before thinking threres something wrong with the player behind it. <br />
<br />
Would YOU like Shatter Shield? FFB? HotFart? That ***Stun? more Spam options for being stupid? Id exchange ALL of that for Thunderstorm :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Student of the Mind moved to tier 3 from tier 9. No longer requires 2/2 Potent Spirit.<br />
<br />
Arcane Impact replaced with Spell Impact: Increases the critical strike chance of your Arcane Explosion, Arcane Blast, Blastwave, Fire Blast, Ice Lance and Cone of Cold spells by an additional 2/4/6%.<br />
<br />
Arcane Potency no longer requires 5/5 Arcane Concentration. Now requires 1/1 Presence of Mind.<br />
<br />
NEW Talent: Arcane Flows reduces the cooldown of your Presence of Mind, Arcane Power, and Invisibility spells by 30 sec. Requires 1/1 Arcane Power.<br />
<br />
Potent Spirit removed. (Increases your spell critical strike rating equal to 15% of your total Spirit.)<br />
<br />
Netherwind Presence changed to: Increases your spell haste by 2/4/6%. Moved from tier 10 to tier 9.<br />
<br />
NEW Talent: Missile Barrage gives your Arcane Barrage, Fireball, Frostbolt and Frostfire bolt a 3/6/9/12/15% chance to reduce the channeled duration of the next Arcane Missiles spell to 1.5 sec and fire missile every .3 sec!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
So Mage's QQ, and they decide to modify the Arcane tree? WTF?<br />
<br />
Pretty much most of those changes really aren't changes at all, something not being required to get another thing if you're going arcane you'd be getting those things anyways for the most part. From a PVP point of view crit % does not help you alot since resilience counters crit, where as from a PVE perspective if you're going a deep arcane build you don't want alot of spell haste unless you want to increase your DPS at the cost of your DPM which in the end lowers your overall damage by alot since you'll be OOM in less than 60 seconds.<br />
<br />
Oh and they're giving mages machine gun missiles again? Didn't they do that before but say it was too OP to have that on a focus gem? Somehow I think they're going to end up nerfing it if anything, if not I'll be happy, but they've already screwed up Arcane from when it was fun once, what's to stop them from doing it again?</div></div><hr />

QFT, need changes to the class if you are going to change them in patches. I honestly think blizz is just messing with mages or something. Obviously they wouldn't want to just delete a class from the game, but it appears they are trying.<br />

I keep wanting to believe that it's going to be a surprise party for mages when WotLK is finalized, but who knows blizz has given the complete shaft to the class before</div></div><hr />

Actually Shaman complained that the FT debuff would NOT be the fix to enhancement that everyone wanted. Everyone else was complaining/congratulating Shaman's for &quot;finally getting the fix they deserved&quot; when they had no idea what change shaman (Enhance inparticular) needed/needs. They are snared, slowed, and kited - if you cant hit the target a ms debuff isnt going to help you<br />
<br />
I'm sure they have many changes coming to mages that they just forgot to add into the notes...remember it is early in beta so dont jump to conclusions until you see the finished project.

Ice Block<br />
15 Mana<br />
Instant cast	5 min cooldown<br />
You become encased in a block of ice, protecting you from all physical attacks and spells for 10 sec, but during that time you cannot attack, move or cast spells. Also causes Hypothermia, preventing you from recasting Ice Block for 30 sec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ice Barrier	Rank 6<br />
565 Mana<br />
Instant cast 30 sec cooldown<br />
Instantly shields you, absorbing 1075 damage. Lasts 1 min. While the shield holds, spells will not be interrupted.<br />

You could be on to something here. Since haste now effects melee and spells, we could easily start slicing stuff up with daggers, swords, and staves.<br />

Outside of Paladin tanks tho, we may be signing an even faster death wish list if we do this however.<br />
<br />
Would like to test how Living Bomb would do damage with my current gear raiding into the start of t6, so the Hyjal trash for example, but won't know that unless I can get a beta key, and enough mobs around me to test it on without dying. Seen the vid from the Stockades, and hoping the actual damage done is better.<br />
<br />
What I'm not liking about some of the new fire talents, are how they aren't exactly buffing us as we take them. Some give more crit damage done, but then again Burnout saps our mana faster again, countering MoE.<br />
<br />
I am wondering tho', what will be the next mage spell/ability to be removed and put ingame as either default of trainable like Detect Magic and Iceblock have gone. Afterall, we need the game easy for all those new Wrath players ::)</div></div><hr />

Actually, you picked one point, and got it worng. I didn't pick anything.<br />
<br />
In my head? I'm thinking &quot;Why won't something be done to fix some of the obvious issues the Mage class has, some of which have been around for a while now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Solid in pvp using a single spec, they are not competitive in PvE with little of their utility required in raids bar 2 spells, one of which can be done outside the raid group, and our DPS is not fine. We're out DPS'd by Rogues, that's fine. Out DPS'd by locks, go check the coefficiant differences from t6 and casting time reductions on what spells are used in raid rotations to see how that's working for us, and some of our &quot;best&quot; DPS spells, are very risky to use. A lock wants to AoE a group of mobs being tanked? They stand back, fire off a SoC, and it explodes, and they can cast this on all the mobs very quickly. Mages have to pick a choice between an AoE that uses all it's mana from the start of a channel that has you root for several seconds, or run in for PBAoEs that expose you to melee strikes or defensive PBAoE auras.<br />
<br />
Also, trying to make a point using capitals just makes you seem desperate to get your point heard, and that the only way you will manage that is by being loud, rather than right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, your Caps lock/shift key seems starved of attention again.<br />
<br />
Want other issues besides the DPS one?<br />
<br />
Have 3<br />
<br />
1. Mana retention: So far we have SPriests who can talent to regen mana every once and a while, Shaman with totems, and Druids with a self innervate. Locks can Life tap, yes it causes them to lose health, but in a raiding situation if a healer sees someone drop health in combat, it's going to get healed fast, or the lock summons and saccs a Fel Puppy, while Sacc still works like that.<br />
Mages have mana gems that share CDs with healthstones and such things as Flamecaps, and Evocation which is an 8 second channel spell, (10 in Wrath), so roots you, can be easily broken and interupted.<br />
2. Raid Synergy: We can give a fire damage boost to those that use it. So... Flameshocking Shaman, and Fire using Locks, despite Shadowbolt spam giving better output.<br />
3. Blink: Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt. Put the smallest of elevations infront of us at times, and we move about 3 inches forward.<br />
<br />
If you want more, go check a mage forum, yes there will be pointless complaining, but you will get that on pretty much any board online about anything, it's part of life. If you have the perception, you will be able to pick out the actual issues mentioned, rather than dismissing them all as &quot;QQing&quot; or crying.<br />
<br />
Edit: Added locks to #1</div></div><hr />

<br />
2: i'm not seeing the issue? locks outdpsing you?<br />
<br />
3: it's an mmo. fortunately, blink works fine in arena, and you don't absolutely need it to work anywhere else. though i must admit, it ruins the fun factor.</div></div><hr />

3: Blink doesn't work in all the arena grounds. Lordaeron has clipping so you either move backwards or forwards when the spell is used. It's also got its uses in various PvE setups.</div></div><hr />

Please come back to me once you've played a mage in Sunwell.<br />
<br />
Mages can really shine when it comes to t4-t5 and early t6 content, but as you start to progress into Sunwell is when their damage output starts to decline. Even when we're equally geared are we still being outdps'd by warlocks and hunters. We have to really push for the extra mile in order to compete for the top 5; flame caps instead of mana gems, destruction potions instead of mana potions, and very, VERY careful timing of our cooldowns (I have a freakin' list for Brutallus). Imp. shadowbolt has better synergy than imp. scorch does. A shadow priest is a must-have to even be viable; otherwise, we're better off being replaced by another class. Even after doing all of that do we remotely even come out being close to being at the top.<br />
<br />
As for the rogues--you guys do some beastly dps which makes up for your lack of raid buffs. Our three rogues always come out in the top 5.<br />
<br />
Sunwell basically has a ton of raid-wide damage going on, and most raid leaders don't bring more than one mage to their raids. You can look at SK Gaming/Nihilum's first boss kills and raid compositions if you don't believe me. Ranged dps-wise, why bring a mage when they have less survivability and can only do a small fraction of the damage that a hunter or a warlock can do? It'd be justifiable to bring more than 2 if they had some amazing dps to make up for the lack of stamina. I often find myself being forced to swap out pure damage gear for pvp stam gear during certain fights so I can get closer to the x amount of hp needed for a certain fight.. thus gimping whatever &quot;dps&quot; that I had. Other classes don't have that problem.<br />
<br />
Our AOE is nothing compared to SoC. Invisibility and evocation is crap due to it being tricky on when to time it because of all of the raid-wide damage going on (ie. Felmyst, M'uru, Twins). So there's basically a chance that it'll get interrupted by taking damage (invis. takes 5 seconds to set in completely) and you'll get your face eaten off by the raid boss. No one EVER, ever evocates for more than 2 full ticks. Otherwise, it's a loss of dps, so we don't even get the full benefit of that spell.<br />
<br />
Mages don't bring a lot to the table (lols, pun) besides the AI buff (completely replaced by Kiru's song of victory in Sunwell, so good-bye, AI), amp magic, and a table. Oh sure, we have sheep as an excellent CC for Kalecgos/M'uru trash! In that case, all you have to do is bring in a second mage specifically to sheep, then boot him/her afterwards during Twins+ for a better ranged dps class. Same with tables. I've seen it happen in my guild, and it's not a pretty sight.<br />
<br />
I know that if it truly were up to me as a raid leader in Sunwell, I'd only bring in one mage for the necessary group buffs/table and give the other ranged dps spots to warlocks/hunters. It's more practical.<br />
<br />
That is the sad state of the mage class in end-game raiding.<br />
<br />
/QQ<br />
<br />
With that being said, the expansion looks very promising for the mage class.. as to why... <br />
<br />
According to a couple of beta testers, frostfire bolt gets EVERY benefit from the frost and fire talents (eg. winter's chill, ignite, frostbite, etcetc). FFB+elementalist builds might be what mages are looking for in terms of &quot;jaw-dropping damage&quot; in the coming expansion (50% crit with shatter and winter's grasp, anyone?). We shall see..</div></div><hr />

<br />
finally some one else who realizes how amazing this spell will be :]<br />
<br />
and lol some ones gonna think you made this account to promote your self</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mahtamori</div><div class="date">2008-07-25, 08:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">silly kalgan, you should have to use up bag space for your tanking gear like every other class<br />
<br />
There is a very, very large possibility that this was what he was thinking of. He's talking about talents and abilities, after all, NOT gear.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">asmogan</div><div class="date">2008-07-25, 09:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol, anub'arak ? :O</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Turicus</div><div class="date">2008-07-25, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">at last, frostfire bolt is starting to look like the light at the end of the tunnel. mages need more single-target and aoe dps in endgame. frostfire bolt may cover that, if they get base damage and scaling right. now we just need a good aoe fire spell.<br />
<br />
why do i, as a firemage, have to spam an point-blank arcane spell as my main source of aoe damage? it means i get zero benefit from talents (crit, damage, mana return etc.) and i have to stand in the middle, when locks can do it with their main damage school and do it from 30 yards range.<br />
and don't say flamestrike, because it's shit. if i spam it, i overwrite the dot component, and the dps turns to crap. dragon's breath is on a 20sec CD and is directional, blast wave is on a 30sec CD and gives up base damage for a daze effect that is useless if the mobs are being tanked anyway.<br />
<br />
and my single-target dps depends on massive cooldown and group stacking yet i still come out way behind locks in dps AND survivability. on top of this, their aggro dump is instant (ok, not a full dump) whereas mine takes FIVE seconds to cast which in any endgame encounter will get interrupted anyway. i get nothing or maybe one tick (yay, like 10% aggro dumped) out of it.<br />
<br />
blink has been buggy since vanilla WoW. i blink backwards all the time in arena.<br />
<br />
now tell me we don't need some work done. there is something in that text for every class except mages. you've got to be taking the piss.<br />
<br />
before the &quot;QQ more, do you want double rogue dps blabla&quot; replies come: no, i don't want to be miles ahead of all other DD. i just want dps output that has some relation to my raid utility and survivability. the glass cannon of old.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bravefish</div><div class="date">2008-07-25, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i might sound daft but tbh they should bin blink and replace it with something that works like blink but with an added twist (imp sprint or +25% crit on next instant cast for eg), by doing this they create a new spell from scratch not copy paste blink.<br />
<br />
why bin it and not &quot;repair&quot; it u ask?<br />
<br />
well blizz are mint at making stuff from new nowadays as they have learned how u utilise the engine, but not so hot on sorting stuff thats been annoyin folk for years, looking at code that was created in 2003, take shadowstep for example, its a blink that works, and the moving effect has worked from day one.</div></div><hr />
