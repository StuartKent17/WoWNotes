Armory Stats - Legendary Quest Line Achievements<br />
Today we are taking a look at the legendary quest achievement completion rate of players. The data used today is a sample of 2.1 million players active since August 1. We also did this at the end of 2013 for Mists of Pandaria, which you can see here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3644-Armory-Stats-Legendary-Quest-Achievements-Blue-Tweets-IV-Contest-Voting). As a sidenote, 35.86% of players also have a Level 3 shipyard (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/10168-naval-armada).<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
in this case it doesn't seem to be a vocal minority either. Far more people than average posted disapproval<br />
It's rather difficult to evaluate whether a majority feels a certain way without a relatively scientific survey. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/649220635047034881))<br />
And majority rule isn't always great for design either. Cell phone customers always just ask for more battery life not features. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/649221327820222464))<br />

2.1m players the survey covers, not necessarily related to the sum total of all active WoW players.<br />
The MoP legendary survey they referenced in the post only analyzed 2m accounts, and presumably more people still played then?</div></div><hr />

You made the right call. I have level 2 and I've said eff it Khadgar can use the legendary as a cock ring for all I care. The entire design of the shipyard UI and experience is so horrible I'm amazed it passed muster. Then I remember that I'm playing WoD and the amazement shifts to the fact that I came back (even to just show support for player flight).

<br />
Every single bad feature was requested by the &quot;majority&quot;<br />
<br />
Ever heard of the bell curve? Understand intelligent quotient And how it's quantified? Why 100 is baseline/average and each deviation above is a fraction of the population?<br />
<br />
Because just like anywhere and everywhere (but especially with wow and the web) the majority are ultimately dumber than the minority. Statistical fact.<br />

Never listen to the majority If you want something right.</div></div><hr />

There is no way you can make 60k gold on a dead EU realm. If you have a barn, a tradeing post, maybe a lumberer, with full treasure hunter followers, fully upgraded shityard which sometimes needed 500 gr to handle encounters and at least 2 skill shops... there is just no way to do that with 1-2hrs/day. <br />
10-15k is the top if you have no life. But I would like to see a video how you can make this day by day.</div></div><hr />

I was only a casual player during MoP, but I found some bits of the legendary questline to be fun. I specifically remember the stuff on the Isle of Thunder being a somewhat cool solo challenge. But the WoD quests were rather lame. Going to fight Kairoz was good, but everything else was so quick and rushed. Both the Garona fight and the last fight were right there where the tower was. Felt really underwhelming. I guess they maybe made it quick like that for the people who leave mid-raid to go get their ring and come back? Whatever the reason, it did not compare to the MoP questline at all. The PvP portion in MoP was absolutely terrible, though. I am glad they did not continue that particular trend.<br />
I assume they're not going to have another one of these with artifacts on the way. Probably a good thing.</div></div><hr />

People like you are everything that's wrong with this game. 1: not an active player, yet subs to contribute to unnecessary protest for an unnecessary feature, then unsubs after getting way. 2: whines about a totally optional legendary questline (which is less time investment/grindy than MoP or other previously mandatory rep grinds). 3: expect monumental gameplay shifts for temporary feature that only relates to said questline and most people don't want/like. 4: obviously rode the hype train and forgot what the game actually is. Still/more-quickly bored of endgame yet blames new features/lack of content.</div></div><hr />

MMO-Champion's audience is and always has been a small minority of WoW's playerbase.<br />
<br />
The sample size for the achievement data was 2.1 million accounts. The sample size for the poll is currently 21k users. In other words, all of the people who voted in that poll amount to only 1% (repeat: ONE PERCENT) of the achievement data sample size. If you were to compare that to subscribers worldwide, it would be close to 0.4%.<br />
<br />
The absolute truth is that the vast majority of WoW players don't actively engage with the community, post on forums, or even keep up to date with WoW news on sites like this one. Most players just play the game, and that's about as far as their experience extends.<br />
<br />
You'd be surprised how many active subscribers are out there who wouldn't even know Legion was announced if it weren't for the news banner on the Battle.net Launcher.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup, it's a requirement for raiding, especially for Mythic. I took a big break from the game after we finished HC BRF, but we're getting into Mythic HFC now, and not having my ring isn't great.<br />
<br />
The average person in the raid team is at 760+ on the ring and I still need those silly Tomes to get mine. Which from what I saw in the legendary questline cut scenes aren't even used to upgrade the ring from 715. It's just a useless RNG grind for an item that hardly feels or looks Legendary.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why does Lt. Morales' shield have the caduceus on it? The caduceus is NOT the medical symbol, the Rod of Asclepius is.<br />
<br />
It is in the USA, where the Military adopted it as their medical symbol in the 19th century. <br />
<br />
&quot;Despite widespread acceptance of the caduceus as a medical symbol in the United States, it has been observed that the rod of Asclepius has &quot;the more ancient and authentic claim to be the emblem of medicine&quot;.[14] Most attempts to defend its use in a medical context date from the last quarter of the 19th century through the first quarter of the 20th, and have been characterized as &quot;based on flimsy and pseudo-historical research&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
So because it's dirty and everyone could get it and hence refuses to get it, we're now having figures that less than one in five has it. By the same line of reasoning we could call Mythic 'dirty'.</div></div><hr />

Yep, it's stupid. Someone back in the day chose it for a medical context because it &quot;looked better.&quot; One of the Blizzard artists made the same choice, probably for the same reason.<br />

There's not so much reasons to grind Hellfire Shitadel.<br />
<br />
* Pre-legendary ring is good enough for everything up to mythic HFC. Considering how miniscule mythic raiding community is... why bother for legendary ring?<br />
* You will replace it with first green dropped in legion so why bother?<br />
* Assuming Blizz will remove transmog restrictions for legendaries you will not be able to use ring anyway so why bother?<br />

I don't think this is about what phone but what you are doing ON that phone. This is a message to everyone, put the phone down, go outside, stop twittering and snappy chatty or whatever the hell you do and talk to someone. You will find it's much more enjoyable<br />

You know some of us use our phones for work related purposes too? I wouldn't touch an iphone with a 10ft pole anyway</div></div><hr />

I just cannot bear to grind away in LFRs for the chance of getting a couple of tomes. And it's all to get a ring that isn't even a personal CD, it's for the entire raid, and is hardly what I'd call &quot;legendary&quot;. <br />
If Tomes were a guaranteed drop, I'd just grit my teeth and finish the chain, but when it's a chance drop, I'm just not masochistic enough to go through with it.<br />
That's the thing, the ring is really not suited for casual players. If you're in an organized raiding guild, the ring is somewhat cool in the sense that it's something you coordinate together to get the most potential out of. (There's still arguments to be made about the whole concept in general, but in this environment it is mostly acceptable.) But if you're just queuing for things by yourself, it's awful. Anyone can just pop it when they feel like it, and it affects everyone else. I personally am in a raiding guild so I'm fine with it, but I can definitely understand the lack of enthusiasm about it from &quot;casual&quot; players.</div></div><hr />

Cape wasn't replaced until you got something better from heroic dungeons. And even then it might still have been better in some cases due to the three secondary stats.</div></div><hr />

then there was another token grind... and another... and the shipyard missions. ughhh. i can't think of anything less legendary. the cool little quests scattered inbetween are all eclipsed by the repetitive ones</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have so many toons at this point (12 now I think). My 2 mains are at 7/33 and 8/33. I did HFC twice on each and I want to cry at the thought of doing it enough to just complete it on my priest, let alone my rogue. HFC by all means is not that bad of a raid instance, but holy hell's balls is LFR a nightmare. Normal is almost as bad with insane group requirements of Heroic clears or no invites at times. Ones without the said requirements are filled with people who expect to be carried and stand in everything that is bad. It is like pugging Normal Lick King in WotLK all over again. STOP STANDING IN DEFILE!!!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aliok</div><div class="date">2015-10-07, 12:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">People like you are everything that's wrong with this game. 1: not an active player, yet subs to contribute to unnecessary protest for an unnecessary feature, then unsubs after getting way. 2: whines about a totally optional legendary questline (which is less time investment/grindy than MoP or other previously mandatory rep grinds). 3: expect monumental gameplay shifts for temporary feature that only relates to said questline and most people don't want/like. 4: obviously rode the hype train and forgot what the game actually is. Still/more-quickly bored of endgame yet blames new features/lack of content.<br />
<br />
Yes, it was late at night, I was on mobile, and I was cranky for several reasons, so my brusque choice of phrasing leaves something to be desired but the central point still stands. For me, not a single part of the legendary chain was fun or especially interesting - unlike the chain from MoP. Don't worry, I'm not putting on rose-tinted glasses. I still have extra sigils of wisdom in my main's bank and my literal tears of frustration from the PvP part in mind. But overall the experience from MoP was greatly better than what I got out of the WoD chain thus far.<br />
<br />
For the rest of your points:<br />
<br />
1. I was a very active player. Know the joke about how to tell someone is a vanilla veteran? (&quot;Don't worry, they'll tell you.&quot;) I don't consider myself part of the now-&quot;cyclical&quot; subscription base and I don't want to be a part of the cycle. I've been playing this game for ten years, and other Blizzard Entertainment properties even longer ago. But at some point even a fan like me has to re-evaluate when faced with the issues in and surrounding the game's design, implementation, communication, and Blizzard Entertainment as a whole.<br />
<br />
A. What is considered a 'necessary feature' is entirely dependent upon point of view. I didn't renew in protest with many of other players (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/search?f=post&amp;q=Watcher%20says%20no%20flying%20in%20WoW%27s%20future.) (to the point that one of the hashtags being used actually trended on Twitter) because the unavailability of flight in WoD and its permanent removal from future World of Warcraft all future content drastically, negatively affected how we play the game. I have every legitimate right and reason as an unsatisfied paying customer - and one could argue even moral obligation as a fan - to say, &quot;hey, I don't like this, here's why, and here's what I am going to do to let you know how serious I am about this.&quot; The ball was then in Blizzard's court.<br />
B. I honestly don't really feel like I 'got my way.' From one of my comments elsewhere: &quot;It is also brought to you by WoW designers who decided that, in truly amazing display of passive-aggressiveness, gated [Draenor Pathfinder] behind the very lackluster content which players have also been complaining about to them AND while not specifying any timeframe for when Draenor Flying will be patched in to the game.&quot; And from what we've learned from the dev watercooler, GamesCom, and the silence from Blizzard designers, we are set to have this style of &quot;fun&quot; for Legion. <br />
<br />
2. No, the legendary is not optional content.<br />
<br />
A. It's an integral part of the story line - disjointed as it feels to me - for the very expansion that I paid more for than all previous expansion packs. Optional would be Val'anyr, Hammer of Ancient Kings (http://www.wowdb.com/items/46017-valanyr-hammer-of-ancient-kings) or the like because A) random fragment drops and B) there was no story attached to it. Did I want it? Oh yes baby I wanted. Did I get it? No, and I accepted that with equanimity. Besides, one or two expansions later I could just farm for it - which I did, by the way - because it's not going anywhere. Blizzard destroyed that concept with the abrupt announcement of the legendary cloaks becoming unobtainable (I would have liked having one of each and was willing to - at my own pace - work toward that goal with the necessary alts), and with the legendary rings set to become unobtainable from the very start. So...<br />
B. If I want to experience the story tied to the ring, said story being tied into the expansion's story itself, then it's definitely not optional.<br />
<br />
3. I'm not sure what your point was, and quite frankly I've stopped caring but I'll go ahead and do #4 anyway.<br />
<br />
4. I didn't ride the hype train. I never even boarded it. From the moment &quot;Warlords of Draenor&quot; was announced, I had misgivings. Blizzard struggled to define the expansion. Anyone remember this?<br />
<br />

<br />
I was in the WoD beta, and I pointed out several design problems. Of course, from my experience with the Diablo 3 beta, I had little expectation of actually being listened to, but I felt compelled anyhow. (I totally called it on Ashran, by the way; perculia et al. were busy gushing over it.)<br />
<br />
And what did Tanaan Jungle - which I will point out was supposed to be in the game at the beginning - add beside a raid and player flight? I'm not blaming lack of content so much as wondering if Blizzard understands that the features and content it is putting into the game this whole expansion appear to not match what a very large minority (if not majority) of players want and/or expect from the game? I am not talking about catering to majority rule, but to whether Blizzard's future goal(s) for the product matches up with the reality of a long established player base that may or may not accept large changes in the game's direction.<br />
<br />
Anyway, don't people who talk like you also write &quot;just leave if you're unhappy&quot;? Of course, leaving is not a satisfactory solution and I'm going to be unhappy regardless but I'm walking the walk nonetheless. I've now spent 2.5 hours replying to you. Really, I want that time back. I should have simply ignored someone whose best argument was 'casual' and putting words in my mouth. Good night.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thorvath</div><div class="date">2015-10-07, 07:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The ring was one of the reasons I re-upped... though if I had unsubbed prior to completing the BRF grind then maybe it would have been a different story. I mean at the end of the day it's a subscriber retention plan.. the game needs grinds, it's just reality. The grinds that work best are the ones that you don't notice because you were going to do that activity anyway. Sadly the neutering of anything that may even appear to feel like a reward in LFR meant that the legendary grind was very obvious in HFC. Haven't been back since I got the ring.<br />
<br />
While I can excuse the grind as a necessary evil, the milestone quests and lore fluff were pretty underwhelming in comparison to MoP. Wrathion would deliver full on speeches, Khadgar gives a few pithy one-liners. We had quests that took us to multiple places in Pandaria and were integral to the expansion's storyline, tying the max level content together. Khadgar leaves his tower once, to hang out in your shipyard (just so he can send you back to his tower as it turns out) and the legendary story is almost completely unrelated to the ongoing WoD storyline. They could replace the entire questline with an NPC that shows the 'Gul'dan takes over the Iron Horde' cutscene.</div></div><hr />

<br />
pretty much sums up whats wrong with games development.<br />
<br />
If people want more battery life, give it to them, then add features on top. Dont do an Iphone 6 and give a shit load of features but nuke the battery life into the dirt....sure the features are shiny and nice, but at the end of the day its a phone, and decent battery life is what people want most, its not exciting, but thats how it goes. get the core product right, and build on it, dont go for shiny shit and produce a piss poor performing product just becuase you like shiny new features.</div></div><hr />
