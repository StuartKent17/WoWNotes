Lady Sinestra First Kill (and bugs)<br />
I do think you have to take the tone of that post in the context in which it was written. Because Sinestra is a super-hardcore boss, they were pretty much the first ones to really push her mechanics to the limits. It's easy to see from their post that they were understandably frustrated. Not only were they trying to learn the mechanics and develop strategies, but we were watching closely, hotfixing several different issues as they stumbled across them. This meant they had to adapt to the changes we were making on the spot in addition to figuring out how to kill her -- and she's definitely no pushover.<br />
<br />
We do wish it would have been a cleaner fight for them, but we really appreciate them pushing the limits of hardcore raiding, and testing us to design new and compelling challenges. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/152991/did-paragon-enjoy-their-journey))<br />

Dungeon Difficulty and Ghostcrawler's Blog - Wow, Dungeons are Hard! (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/829237-Wow-Dungeons-are-Hard!)<br />
I know you're probably frustrated by any number of issues Ghostcrawler tackled in his blog. We completely get that, which was the entire point of his post. We're not telling players it's our way or the highway. We're not burying our heads in the sand and letting you figure it out. He took a lot of his own time to try and provide some insight and positive reinforcement, admit some design mistakes we've made in Cataclysm, and let you know (most importantly) that we hear you.<br />
<br />
We also have to recognize that there is a harsh debate within the community right now about the difficulty level. Players are flinging mud at one another and saying &quot;learn to play&quot;, or &quot;go grind in some other hardcore MMO&quot;. People aren't in agreement about these things and need to tone down the rhetoric (which Ghostcrawler addresses eloquently in his blog).<br />
<br />
We're not going to join that debate, though we are players too. The best we can do right now -- as I think Ghostcrawler noted well -- is keep the dialog open and encourage constructive criticism, and even positive feedback. Hearing both what players like and don't like about select aspects of gameplay is useful to us.<br />
<br />
The entire reason behind him writing that blog sprung from us sending him a particular thread (amongst many other we've been sending him since the launch of Cataclysm) that had him really concerned: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/1660221627<br />
<br />
He wants to see the tone of the debate changed so we can work together to make this a better game, so it's really unfortunate when you post as though he's throwing the naughty finger in your face. His post was not written from a place of hubris. Those who would take it that way probably just fundamentally disagree with the current design philosophy. But only two things are true in this case: 1) we will never please everyone with our design, and 2) we will never stop listening to our players.<br />
<br />
In any event, I appreciate you taking the time to post. I just hope you can keep an open mind and a thoughtful dialog with us, as simply sharing with us how you perceive Ghostcrawler's attitude to be won't move game design anywhere. That's just the reality of it all. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/152998/ghostcrawlers-article-on-dungeons))<br />
<br />
Removing guild reputation requirements for officers<br />
Sounds great, here's how that would work out: I have an awesome end-game progression guild. We're level 25. You give me 20k gold, I send you an invite and promote you to the highest officer rank. You buy whatever rewards you want, and then leave.<br />
<br />
This is not the intent of the system. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/152013/guild-rep-is-100-stupid))</div></div><hr />

The next content patch just brings Valor gear down to Justice. By the time that happens, everyone will already have all the Valor gear on their mains, so Justice will be useless again.<br />
<br />
I imagine this thread will be 20 pages of people going &quot;WTF PRICES SO HIGH&quot; even though they announced last week the prices would be very high.<br />

January 14th:<br />
The Honor Commodities and Justice Commodities Vendors now sell raw tradeskill materials. These are not intended to be a cost-effective source of these materials, but an option for players with lots of Justice or Honor Points who have already purchased all of the gear that interests them.</div></div><hr />

Given the materials being offered, all this will do is tank the market for enchanting mats. Enchanting is already stupid expensive to level, the addition of the DE button drove the prices down substantially and this will further tank the prices.</div></div><hr />

It's like the experience from mining, herbing, and archeology: Nice, convenient, makes you feel like spending time doing those things isn't a complete waste, but not nearly as efficient for leveling as actually grinding quests and dungeons.<br />
<br />
This is far more efficient than purchasing an OH for the sake of vendoring it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How can you say that Enchanting is stupid expensive to level, then say that the raw material prices are too low?<br />
<br />
I leveled up enchanting when it was STUPID expensive, and still got all my money back after one week of DE'ing heroics.<br />
<br />
Plus if you think that doing 4+ heroics for one shard is going to change any prices even in endgame, I think you are very wrong.</div></div><hr />

Not working that way. When new tier is added, your Justice Points will be replaced with your current VP. And your VP will be set to 0. So if you have 4000 JP and 1000 VP, you will now have 1000 JP and 0 VP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well the prices are really way too high. To farm a pile of cloth you need like 2-4 minutes. In order to farme those JPs you need more like 4-6 hours (!) worth of heroics.<br />
<br />
As an enchanter it probably better to buy those 900 JP blues and dissenchant them for a chance of an crystal. With the next tier, you could buy those epics and also diss. them.<br />

The prices may or may not be adjusted. And honestly, the vendors are for people (like me) who are capped, have been capped, and will continue to be capped for the foreseeable future. I run 2-3 dungeons a day with guildies. It's nice to know that after someone else gets the orb I can still get SOMETHING useful from the runs.</div></div><hr />

An unfortunate Blizzard trend. I also need herbs for Inscription since I pvp exclusively and don't gold farm or herb, but I'm not convinced that 20 random herbs for that price is valuable at all.<br />
<br />
Would like to see raw gems added again. Maybe some metas.<br />
<br />
I've been honor capped for weeks now, many times over, and have been buying Wintergrasp heirlooms. Kinda wish they'd make conquest gear available at a 2 to 1 price. However, Blizz has not been able to stop botting so I doubt they would do this.</div></div><hr />

Being capped always feels like a waste, even if we're talking about virtual currencies.<br />

I do wish they'd upgrade the old mana potions for honor though, the ones which only work in battlegrounds.<br />
Food, drinks and bandages too, oh and the PvP enchants!<br />

Don't need a blue source. Well, either it will work like THAT. Or they will add a third currency, which was the reason why they deleted all 55000 diffrent currencys in the first place. Just using my brain a bit. I can't see why they should add a third currency now when they finally got rid of the 4 or 5 diffrent we had a while, for raiding.<br />
Newest raidcontent will always give VP while older give JP.</div></div><hr />

Not cost-effective is one thing, 2000 points for a single stack of ore while I get 70 points per heroic boss is completely absurd. I hope they decrease these prices a lot. If they don't, I'll probably buy every single damn heirloom there is for the day when they allow mailing them across servers (somewhere in patch 9.01, most likely, right after dance studios are released.

There's a big difference between that and a total ripoff.<br />
Example: 20 Elementium ore for 2000 JP. It takes 15 minutes to mine them, but depending on various factors (instance, role, PUG or guild run), can take between 1 and 3 hours (average 2 hours) to get 2000 JP. So the equivalent cost would be 2000 JP / (2 hours / 15 minutes) = 250 JP.<br />
Efficient would be buying Elementium for that price or lower.<br />
A price of 500 or 1000 JP would not be efficient but not the joke 2000 JP is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the VP to JP conversion will work differently: <br />
<br />
With the release of the next Tier-Raiding Gear alls VP will be added to your current amount of JPs. If you exceed the 4k JPs because your current amount and added ammount of Points exceeds the 4k you'll end up with like 6k JPs. But then, you're capped. You can't earn any more points until you drop below the cap (currently 4k). <br />
<br />
Don't forget: The 4k cap was introduced so people sond save all their JPs for the day VP-Gear gets converted to JPs! <br />
<br />
There is no sense in NOT adding the VP points on top of the JP points because you already could have bought your gear in the first place...<br />

You're about as idiotic as your avatar looks.<br />
You're not going to do two battle grounds to get one dust. You're going to do two battlegrounds because you feel like doing two battlegrounds. Then you realize you're capped on honor. Oh, golly gee...whatever will you do with it?<br />
<br />
People, don't be idiots like Ibbi here. The point is not to create a definite incentive to farm JP or Honor. The point is to make it so that peeps who are capped and have purchased every other item that interests them don't feel like those activities give them nothing but the satisfaction of a job well done.<br />
<br />
You can argue about the exact pricing, and there are some good points that the prices are a touch too high (which might very well be adjusted before the changes to live). But the fact remains they will never be, and should never be, nearly as efficient as normal means of farming.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Manchego</div><div class="date">2011-01-21, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I certainly hope that the prices are a placeholder, because they're ridiculous. Compare any of these items to the current JP gold sink, WotLK epic gems. You can purchase any orange, green or purple uncutt epic gem for 110 JP. Cut them into ANYTHING with your JC toon, and the vendor value per gem is 9g each. Thats a pretty solid standard to work from - so lets compare it to the posted prices and see how that stacks up with your server's AH!<br />
<br />
Hypnotic Dust - 200 JP = 1.81 gems per = 16.36g<br />
Greater Celestial Essence - 800 JP = 7.27 gems per = 65.45g<br />
Heavenly Shard - 1200 JP = 10.90 gems per = 98.18g<br />
Savage Leather - 750 JP / 5 (1/4 stack) = 6.81 gems per = 61.36g (245.45 per full stack)<br />
Embersilk Cloth - 2500 JP = 22.72 gems per = 204.54g<br />
Elementium Ore - 2000 JP = 18.18 gems per = 163g<br />
Satchel of Freshly Picked Herbs - 3000 JP = 27.27 gems per = 245.45g<br />
<br />
Even with the state of most Cata Auction Houses, I'm still hard pressed to find much value in this over the gems. Almost every avenue (if not every one) represents devaluation over vendoring obsolete gems. I know that there's a ton of commentary to the effect of &quot;hey, at least I have something to spend my JP / Honor on now since I've been capped out for X amount of time&quot;, but those statements are patently false / uninformed as it was never the case. You always had available sinks, be it gems, primordials / orbs (lol, that), heirlooms, etc.<br />

When they announced that the upcoming patch would provide vendors for trade goods, I was hopeful. Hopeful because, though gold is easier than ever to make in this expansion, inflation and gouging have been through the roof (I'm looking at you, Pristine Hide). Some sort of relief - much like Frozo offered to the Frost Lotus market - was what I expected. Assuming that these prices are not just placeholders, then all we get is a vendor with almost no worth at all, unless its really too difficult for you to trek to Dalaran and cash in your spare JP.<br />
<br />
Great idea, terrible execution. This won't do a thing for the rampant market inflation in the game right now, because it wont introduce any more supply into a supply / demand equation, since its cost prohibitive to even use it. Guess I'll still be spending hours on end farming, rather than blow my entire JP cap for enough Eternium ore to smelt into a single 20 stack of bars.<br />

These vendors are not supposed to be a viable income source for the mid-field honor farmers that ignore all BG objectives so that they could just ruin the associated markets for good!<br />

You either stay capped or you can just earn few extra hundreds of gold sometimes.</div></div><hr />

If so pls tell me when did you go that fast trough a dungeon or raid, did you remember being healed as dps in raid (no, you had to carry your own ass through this) did you remember how long the buffs lasted, do you know what cc, self healing, and stay the f* out of the aoe mend? did you remember what the flask is? do you remember how many wipes was it taking to down a boss, or how much time a simple normal dungeon was it taking?<br />

yes hcs are hard, and they suppose to be that way<br />

Which is why you were asked for a blue source, since what you posted directly contradicted existing statements.<br />
<br />
(why do you think JP is capped? That's because they explicitly said they did not want people to have 12k JP ready to spend on the day 4.1 hits and they suddenly can purchase every epic. If JP/HP were wiped, there would be no need to cap their total)<br />
<br />
Which only means that Blizzard fuck all over and over again then. As it can't be hard to raise cap after just 2-3 weeks, when most normal raiders already got their cap. Rest probably didn't worry about the cap, or farm till cap.</div></div><hr />

2500 JP = 32 epic BC Gems = 32x5 @ vendor = 160g<br />
<br />
And for the jewelcrafters, should you have corresponding pattern (Shattered Sun Offensive/Scale of the Sands), it's 32x(5+1) = 192g<br />
<br />
Have fun :-)<br />
<br />
And if you cut those gems they sell for even more. I believe 1 epic Wrath cut gem sells for 9.5 gold?<br />
<br />
So.... by far it's smarter to spend your JP on Wrath epic gems, cut them, sell them, then use the gold to buy MORE of what you would have gotten if you spent JP on stuff with this stupid JP vendor for Cata items.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, enchanters are expected to not only raid seriously, but also to raid so much and roll so well that they get all the gear they need AND THEN enough extra to be able to shard the 359s just to buy the enchant recipes.

Now at least they can buy some-Cata related mats item and actually continue to receive JP during dungeons instead of getting nothing cuz they're at cap.<br />
<br />
What should be mentioned however, is the worth of using your JP to buy WoTLK epic gems. I know they vendor for 5g, but if you have a JC on my server at least the cuts are still selling for 20-100g, sometimes more depending on the cut or availability. Don't forget that for anyone wearing under lvl 300 gear, they cannot use the new cata gems, even the green ones, and the highest level gem they can equip is the WoTLK epic ones. Trust me those old gems are still selling, +hit, +str, +agi, +int, +stam in particular.<br />
<br />
I think this new vendor is a nice way to use the points if you're capped, but if you're concerned about money and not simply convenience, I'd highly recommend checking out the JP vendors in Dalaran and see if buying epic gems/primordial saronite/boe lvl 80 bracers would be worth more.</div></div><hr />

Yep - 950JP for off hand (e.g. Hermit's Lamp).<br />
<br />
I think what people were expecting was damn expensive ... like Harrods, not ludicrious illogical pricing.<br />
<br />
For 2500JP (10 heroics maybe), you would pick in excess of 40 stacks of cloth during the runs - and they give you 1 more ?<br />

It just seems illogical ?<br />

Not a placeholder.

<br />
If only money, raw gold is involved, then you need to take all aspects into account to calculate proper effectiviness of certain ways of earning gold.<br />
<br />
These simply are more ways to conviniently spend your excess JP/HP. The base perspective is simple: JP/HP go to waste or you get to chose the most convinient way how to spend the excess JP/HP for small bonuses.<br />
<br />
Of course, if you see this change as bound to being a relic wearing class with enchanting, that can buy 174JP relics, de them, shatter shards, sell mats, then you are screwed :) Some class/profession combos will always be better in a specific context than others.<br />
<br />
Overall I am so glad to see that Blizzard now has the policy that profession materials should be mainly produced by appropriate professions instead of getting handed out for free en masse to all day AV /afkers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is wrong. You do not lose your JP when the new tier comes out, your valor points get ADDED to your justice points... that is precisely why there is a very low cap on JP now. So When the new tier comes out, you ´should´have enough JP saved up to buy 1 or 2 new items right away, but not have 10,000 saved up so you can buy everything.</div></div><hr />

I have 4000 JP. There is nothing I can currently buy with JP. I run the daily heroic for VP.. I know that in 2 hours, I´m going to be running a heroic dungeon and will not be earning JP because I am at the cap now. Same thing for tomorrow, and the next day.. and the next day.<br />
<br />
Get it through your thick heads... these vendors were NOT added as an alternative farming source. Yes, we know, you can farm all of these items faster than you can earn the JP to buy them... These vendors were added ONLY for people who are at the JP cap. They were NOT added for a way to farm the materials. The devs, and about 100 people in this thread, have already stated this clear as day.</div></div><hr />

Yea, I'm aware of that and I lose every damned roll on them. That's why I said I'd pay 4000 JP for one. That's got to be at least a full week's worth of runs for 1 crafting item that I actually need 5 of to make my craft.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xentropy</div><div class="date">2011-01-21, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here we go, a quick FAQ for the clueless posters in this thread:<br />
&quot;Why would I buy these materials at this price instead of blue upgrades, heirlooms, or level 80 BoE's for an alt?&quot;<br />
This system isn't for you. It's for people who HAVE all the herilooms, HAVE all the upgrades they need, and HAVE all the BoE's they could want on any alts, and have either been vending gems or just sitting at cap for four weeks already with nothing to do with their JP.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why wouldn't I just save my points for the next content patch when I could buy VP epics for JP?&quot;<br />
This system isn't for you. If you're not already sitting at capped JP with the ability to re-cap several times over before the next major patch, you SHOULD indeed save your points. For those who ARE capped and are worried about not having plenty of points when the patch hits, we'll get at least a month's notice for when 4.1 will be coming via its release on PTR, so you'll know when to start pooling JP again if you have a regular JP income.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would I buy these materials at this price when buying BC gems and vendoring them would give me more gold than any of the choices here?&quot;<br />
You wouldn't. Your server's economy just has materials pegged at lower prices than that of most servers. Enjoy your cheaper AH mats (lucky dogs) and vend those gems!<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would I farm 4 heroics just for a single heavenly shard?&quot;<br />
You wouldn't. You're running the heroics *already* for the daily VP or just to help out friends or guild members. The JP you happen to get circumstantially at the same time currently rots (or goes toward buying epic gems to vendor). Now there is a new use for that otherwise-useless JP.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would I buy cloth at this price when buying the herbs would get me more gold per JP on my server?&quot;<br />
You wouldn't. Buy the herbs and ignore the cloth. On SOME servers, the cloth would be more valuable, but not on yours. Figure out which one's the best way to go on your server and go for it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is Blizzard screwing over gathering professions? This is going to tank mat prices!&quot;<br />
No, it's really not. Look at just how much time must be spent per mat via the heroic or BG farming method and realize being a gatherer gives you a hundred times as many mats per hour spent, or more. This may lower prices negligibly (and extremely temporarily) due to a new supply being introduced to the system, particularly on the first day of the patch when hundreds of people suddenly dump the 4k JP they have had in the bank for weeks, but in the mid- to long-term prices will not be affected significantly by this change due to the small amounts available for large time investments.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why no maelstrom crystals? Those would actually be valuable!&quot;<br />
You answered your own question. If truly rare and valuable materials were cost-effectively available for JP, the prices on that material WOULD in fact be tanked. These prices MUST be set intentionally high to discourage people who wouldn't otherwise already be collecting this JP from starting to collect it just as a method of farming. For maelstrom crystals to be available, the JP cap would need to be MUCH higher, on the order of costing 50,000 JP for one maelstrom crystal, otherwise the entire system would fall apart due to being TOO time-efficient.</div></div><hr />

<br />
January 14th:<br />
The Honor Commodities and Justice Commodities Vendors now sell raw tradeskill materials. These are not intended to be a cost-effective source of these materials, but an option for players with lots of Justice or Honor Points who have already purchased all of the gear that interests them.<br />
<br />
Thanks for clarifying that and quoting the blue source. I still think they are just taking the piss: as a tank you can enter in Grim Batol solo and farm the few troggs before the first trash for 10 minutes and make like 5 bolts of embersilk, and i'm not even exaggerating by much.<br />
<br />
So 2500 JP for that? please try and be serious, the little money you make of a random normal is more that what you need to get a stack from the AH these days.<br />
<br />
To me that sounds like “here suckers, this is to shut down those of you who wine about having nothing to spend points on”<br />
I can’t even begin to comprehend how people can be happy to spend 2500 points on 20 embersilk cloth.<br />
<br />
If you want to put high prices fine, but put them on things that are actually tricky or annoying to get...</div></div><hr />

It would eventually hurt the economy and certain professions if they did.

That's the entire point of how the tier setup is supposed to work.<br />
<br />
Actually, as I understood it, the JP won't disappear, just have the old VP amount added to it, then truncated at 4k (with possibly some gold-for-points conversion on anything over 4k like they did the last time they downconverted stuff, though no guarantees). The VP will disappear though, basically.<br />
<br />
Examples:<br />
Before patch, you have 1600 VP and 2000 JP.<br />
After patch, you'll have 0 VP and 3600 JP.<br />
<br />
Before patch, you have 6000 VP and 0 JP.<br />
After patch, you'll have 0 VP and 4000 JP, with possibly some gold recompense for the 2k excess lost.<br />
<br />
Before patch, you have 0 VP and 3000 JP.<br />
After patch, you'll have 0 VP and 3000 JP.<br />
<br />
This is why JP is capped, so people without VP can't just buy every old VP item the first day. They can only get one or two for whatever JP they were sitting at. If JP were being reset in the manner you suggest, there'd be no reason whatsoever to cap it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People like me who are wondering why in the world all this too high QQ is popping up.<br />
<br />
Stop using the total rip off argument and then trying to justify through some really general completely inaccurate &quot;time to farm the mats&quot; bit. There are a million variables and factors you aren't taking into account just because you want to further your point about it being a rip off. Here's some news, the idea of a &quot;rip off&quot; is subjective. You say it is. I say it isn't. Who's right?<br />
<br />
Oh also the server economy thing. Yeah lets make raw materials, arguably the foundation of a server's economy, easily available through running instances. Shit why not just get rid of gathering professions entirely.<br />
<br />
Yeah all this QQ is stupid.</div></div><hr />

Im not saying you shouldnt spend 2500 on one item. I'm saying you shouldnt spend it on an item that is so ridiculously obtainable by anyone.<br />
<br />
i'm not saying prices are too high, i'm saying the items you pay for are irrelevant. the 2 are completely distinct matters. If you propose something to your playerbase, do it in a way that shows you did some brainstorming.<br />
<br />
This is just a &quot;insert random item&quot; dump of point for the sake of it. The bag might just be the only item where they put some though, since you could very well get a stack of herbs that doesnt take 5 min to farm.<br />
<br />
But that's how far they brainstormed: half an item.</div></div><hr />

Here's one I spent my JP on the past weeks, in the same comparison:<br />
2500 JP = 32 epic BC Gems = 32x5 @ vendor = 160g<br />

And for the jewelcrafters, should you have corresponding pattern (Shattered Sun Offensive/Scale of the Sands), it's 32x(5+1) = 192g<br />

A stack of Ore is less way expensive that a a stack of herb, but they're equivalently difficult to farm. The same stack of ore is also less expensive than a stack of cloth, which most people farm tons of just doing dailies and dungeons. It's by far the most common mat, because there is no required skill to gather it. Savage leather is also way more than either ore or herbs, but requires a similar amount of farm time. Enchanting mats seem about right for the Celestial essence, but the heavenly shards seem cheap relative to the difficulty acquiring them, and the dust seems way over priced considering how much more common it is and how much more of it is typically needed. <br />
<br />
I'd equalize the leather and ore, make the herbs a little more expensive (but not a full 50% more) to account for the random gambling factor that you might get a particularity good herb stack, make Heavenly Shards cost as much as ore and leather, keep Celestial Essence where it is, and make dust like 50 points. That would be pretty relative to their value in gold on the AH.</div></div><hr />

The VP weekly cap is 1250. 10-man raiders get 70 VP per kill, or 910 VP per week from raiding (including a 13th kill on the PvP boss) even if they're full clearing (which is a small subset of 10-man raiders). So even 10-mans that FULL CLEAR need to do 5 out of 7 daily heroics a week to cap VP. Even 25-mans that full clear need to do 2 out of 7 (at 90 VP per boss kill). Right now the VP cap is set up so even raiders need to do heroic dailies, every day for anyone below the bleeding edge (world top 1200 or so) and SOME days even for Paragon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I won’t have the nerve to pretend I can work out a viable price-scarcity ratio on crafting items while maintaining the economies of most servers.<br />
I can tell you that items like Maelstrom Crystals should not be considered in that sort of trading since they can be traded and should remain as rare as they are now.<br />
<br />
However, I can tell you items like Chaos orbs for instance or even big stacks of Volatile something would be actually “interesting” regardless of the cost.<br />
My thinking might not be straight, but I heard once that people without the required skill on a crafting professions cant roll on Chaos Orbs.<br />
<br />
There you go, having them at a high price would offer flexibility without affecting economies too much: they’d still be BoP, and they’d be really expensive.<br />
The Volatile stacks would just be a commodity (maybe in the same way as the herbs bags) since I know that on some servers you cant find more than say 30 Vol Airs at one time.<br />
<br />
I haven’t put much thought in all this and these are just suggestion to answer your questions, don’t get me wrong.<br />
But I still think this would be much more useful while still being very expensive. <br />
<br />
Price isn’t the issue I repeat, it’s just the items that are irrelevant.</div></div><hr />

I gotta wonder what people struggling with the fight mechanics of heroics are going to think when they go trip into Blackwing Descent / Bastion of the Twilight for the first time. But I do know what they're going to admit to themselves, though. &quot;Gee, I wish I hadn't just rolled through the two easiest heroics** over and over to get JP for my gear, so I could have learned how to not stand in fire / handle burst AoE damage / tank positioning better!&quot;<br />
<br />
** being Easy Pinnacle and Throne of the Tides.</div></div><hr />

And what if you have every single of the supposedly useless heirlooms already?</div></div><hr />

Its just a little itty bitty bonus for completling a weeks worth of daily heroics so you can get rid of your points easier if you have nothing else to spend.<br />
<br />
For those complaining about prices, this is not supposed to be a new fast way of obtaining cloth or ore.</div></div><hr />

You aren't suppose to be able to just do heroics and make as much as someone who is actually a herb, be greatful you have something to spend it on. I think this is a nice change, so I don't feel as if I'm waisting time doing heroics.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fuzzbutt</div><div class="date">2011-01-21, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">However spending JP on BC and wrath gems gives a much higher yield than spending JP on the items directly. 3000 JP worth of gems can easily net you at least 2 stacks of herbs.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you want to make more money buying old gems, then by all means go do that. This is specifically designed to NOT be cost effective, to NOT be something you can use to make a lot of money, and to NOT be something you can use to tank the market. I'm not saying whether the design intent is right or wrong, but that was the expressly stated intent of these vendors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They'd be particularly expensive since being BoP means that they can't be sold :) It also means that there'd be no point people without the relevant tradeskills picking them up, as they have literally no use for them.</div></div><hr />

It makes perfect sense to me since I'm already at a loss for what to do, and I've capped JP at least 3 times since release. Runnin out of heirloom items to buy O.o</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KnickKnack</div><div class="date">2011-01-21, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those prices seem pretty high to me. But it's better then not being able to spend those points at all;)<br />
<br />
There is a reason why they are high. If they were low, then it would ruin economy and it would defeat the purpose of farming (other than dungeon farming).</div></div><hr />

And I hope that blue post about Paragon's Sinestra kill quietens the doubters out there.<br />
<br />
And who cares about Sinestra ? They exploited other Bosses</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please just pretend the vendors don't exist, and go about your merry business as if it's still 4.0.3.<br />
<br />
<br />
To those complaining that you can currently buy WOTLK gems, cut them, and vendor them for more than you can get for any of these Cata reagents via JP:<br />
<br />
Please just pretend the vendors don't exist, and continue vendoring WOTLK gems as if it's still 4.0.3.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Some people apparently have less of a problem with reaching the JP cap and then effectively getting nothing from heroic bosses than with being able to spend them on profession mats at an exchange rate that prevents you from farming them just by doing heroics. This isn't WOTLK anymore, where 3 heroics = epic gem = easy 100-150g. Deal with it.</div></div><hr />

They are complaining that they don't get ENOUGH FREE STUFF :D<br />
<br />
You know, Wrath of the Welfareking has done some damage to people's expectations :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cocoa</div><div class="date">2011-01-21, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not working that way. When new tier is added, your Justice Points will be replaced with your current VP. And your VP will be set to 0. So if you have 4000 JP and 1000 VP, you will now have 1000 JP and 0 VP.<br />
<br />
no, you'll have 5000 JP and 0 VP and will need to spend JP to get back below 4k to get any more JP</div></div><hr />

<br />
That just shows that the JP price of items is completely fine, since nobody will be able to tank any markets in an unintended way.</div></div><hr />

2500 JP = 22 epic WOTLK Gems = 22*5 @ vendor = 110G<br />
<br />
Your Argument is invalid. There already IS better stuff ingame to spend the points on.<br />
<br />
You do realize you could cut those epic gems and they sell for an additional 4g per gem... stop acting like a know it all when you clearly don't. :P</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oevaag</div><div class="date">2011-01-21, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not complaining about prices. Like most have stated here will just cntinue to buy WotLK gems for vendoring.<br />
<br />
What is confusing me however is, why it costs 50% in HP as it does to JP ?<br />
<br />
Both have a 4k cap and a max per week of 1250 ? (not a pvp'er)</div></div><hr />

I stack Ore for 3000 JP? lol<br />
I farm 1 Stack in 10 Mins tops, how long you need for 3000 JP ?</div></div><hr />
