Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
It may be true that a tiny % of players post on social media, but are you going to neglect the info you have just because it's not perfect? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/712122737465032704))<br />
you have a concept of perfect info?<br />
Of course not. But it's very easy for game developers to tune out feedback because they are only hearing from a minority. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/712327998746177536))<br />
You should understand it's a minority, but still appreciate the feedback! (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/712328083823439872))<br />

&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/february/overwatchmini.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom:-2px; margin-right:0px; vertical-align:bottom&quot; /&gt; Overwatch - Tracer Pose Removal<br />
The developers responded to a feedback thread to let the community know they were replacing one of Tracer's poses.<br />
So I wanted to start off by saying, I think the development team has done a pretty great job with the cast of female hero's in Overwatch. They are diverse, interesting, and compelling. From Mei to Zarya to Widowmaker the female cast reflects a large spectrum of personalities and player fantasies.<br />
<br />
With that being said, lets talk about Tracer. From a marketing standpoint, she's the star of the show. She's a great hero. When we look at the way she's portrayed in promotional media, lore, and art in game we know a few things about her..<br />
<br />
She's Fast. She's Silly. She's Kind. She's a good Friend. Her body seems to be comprised of about 95% spunk.<br />
<br />
Almost all of her art reflects this. She's got cool skins, She's got fun poses, She's got amazing victory animations. All of this art reinforces the great character you've built around tracer.<br />
<br />
Then out of seemingly no where we have this pose:<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/march/thumb/tracerOMGButtsHideYourKids.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/march/tracerOMGButtsHideYourKids.jpg) <br />
<br />
WHAT? What about this pose has anything to do with the character you're building in tracer? It's not fun, its not silly, it has nothing to do with being a fast elite killer. It just reduces tracer to another bland female sex symbol. <br />
<br />
We'll replace the pose. We want *everyone* to feel strong and heroic in our community. The last thing we want to do is make someone feel uncomfortable, under-appreciated or misrepresented.<br />
<br />
Apologies and we'll continue to try to do better.<br />
<br />
Well, that escalated quickly…<br />
<br />
While I stand by my previous comment, I realize I should have been more clear. As the game director, I have final creative say over what does or does not go into the game. With this particular decision, it was an easy one to make—not just for me, but for the art team as well. We actually already have an alternate pose that we love and we feel speaks more to the character of Tracer. We weren’t entirely happy with the original pose, it was always one that we wrestled with creatively. That the pose had been called into question from an appropriateness standpoint by players in our community did help influence our decision—getting that kind of feedback is part of the reason we’re holding a closed beta test—but it wasn’t the only factor. We made the decision to go with a different pose in part because we shared some of the same concerns, but also because we wanted to create something better.<br />
<br />
We wouldn’t do anything to sacrifice our creative vision for Overwatch, and we’re not going to remove something solely because someone may take issue with it. Our goal isn’t to water down or homogenize the world, or the diverse cast of heroes we’ve built within it. We have poured so much of our heart and souls into this game that it would be a travesty for us to do so.<br />
<br />
We understand that not everyone will agree with our decision, and that’s okay. That’s what these kinds of public tests are for. This wasn’t pandering or caving, though. This was the right call from our perspective, and we think the game will be just as fun the next time you play it.<br />
<br />
If it isn’t, feel free to continue sharing your concerns, thoughts, and feedback about this and other issues you may have with the game, please just keep the discussion respectful.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Or what about creating a skin for her pants which would behave like actual clothing and not like body paint? All girls in my sports classes have been wearing leggings, and no one had her leggings creeping into her buttcrack. Cameltoes have been a greater thing than that. XD</div></div><hr />

Think about that. The end result is the same- mind control and pushing their beliefs on the rest of us.<br />

This ENTIRE 'issue' was 100% created by Blizzard so they could look like good guys and to reenforce that Overwatch will be the politically correct version of Team Fortress.<br />

<br />
Yes it was. It is exactly what it was. There had never been any mention of dislike with the pose and had been a pose that had been in the game since poses were added. less than 2 months before launch some hambeast gets butthurt about it and then it changes instantly.<br />
<br />
This was pandering AND caving.<br />
<br />
Except that what they did wasnt caving or pandering?!?!?!?!<br />
<br />
Do you even know what that is?<br />
Pandering is modifying your behavior to specifically cater to certain demographic.<br />
Caving is giving up on something because of pressure.<br />
<br />
The person brought up a legitimate concern based on real issues, like the established lore of the character and the fact that no one ever ever<br />
ever poses like that unless its a model or porn star showing off their butt.<br />
<br />
I think its funny you bring up &quot;butthurt&quot; when its obviously you people who are freaking out over an out of character victory pose being taken out of the game and replaced with something that makes sense.<br />
<br />
But you know what? it doesnt matter.<br />
<br />
Your opinion doesnt matter, your side doesnt matter. You can go off to your dumb stupid corner of the internet and talk about the glory days when video games were made for men and their penises or whatever. The world has evolved and it doesnt want stupid people like you running the show.<br />
<br />
There was not one -single-reason- to have that other that gratuitous sexification of one of the most innocent childish characters in the game meant to appeal to MANY people, most of whom are non-sexist men, women, or children.<br />
<br />
So while it angers me to see so many idiots on this topic thinking removing a stupid aspect of the game is &quot;pandering to SJWs&quot;, what i'm glad to see is based on the reply that the makers of the game dont agree with you, will never agree with you. I'm sorry but if you think having a basic level or respect and not turning a lovable silly character into soft porn is &quot;pandering&quot; then you are probably just a terrible person who fundamentally hates other people.<br />
<br />
The people behind Overwatch and Blizz have realized that tons of people of every age, gender, and identity plays and loves their games, so they are making games that everyone can enjoy. And this kind of blatant pandering to the (straight) male gaze is unprofessional and completely out of character. They thought so, they said they thought so (and if you disagree then you are just calling them liars which is just stupid), some players agreed which made them realize they were right to get rid of it , so they did.<br />
<br />
But here you go acting like its bad and that it hurts the game and insulting people you dont even know, tons of people who this game is made for.<br />
<br />
I am so happy that blizz and overwatch devs have realized they need to stop making games for gross people like you. I know they are, the signs are all clear. Call people &quot;SJW&quot; all you want. Every generation needs a &quot;racist grandpa&quot; to remind us of how far we've come. Congratulations on being the poster boy for the type of person they dont want to make games for.<br />

Your post is so full of aggression and dismissiveness that is hard to take what you said seriously. You do know that the human species (both men and women) have sexuality - it's part of the human condition. Most of the characters in this game are representative of humans. Sorry it makes you so uncomfortable that one of them has a pose that is VAGUELY enticing. Even characters/people (like Tracer) who are cute and childish and full of energy are allowed to be sexual sometimes, you know.<br />
<br />
Besides, there are 3 male characters with the same victory pose so unless EVERY character in the game is getting that pose removed, it seems like a pretty sexist change to me. Only the women in this game aren't allowed to be (even a tiny bit) sexual I guess.</div></div><hr />

You do realize it's not about the ass or the pose itself right? It's the principle behind why they changed it and how they're trying to pull the wool like it's not. Way more than a minority care about that. Just because you don't care about the ethics of game developers doesn't mean it's just a small amount of &quot;pathetic&quot; people.

Also, when it comes to children and sexuality in movies and video games; as long as it isn't vulgar, kids won't even notice it. It's the adults with issues that start making a problem out of it. Not to mention that Overwatch isn't really a game for children.<br />
<br />
It's not that removing this particular pose is extremely upsetting but it is a case of principle. Those things always start small. SJWs are cancer to all kind of creative thought. It's the mentality of &quot;if I don't like it, noone can experience it!&quot;.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ARhaine</div><div class="date">2016-03-29, 10:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The real problem is not the pose itself really.<br />
It's 'meh' and is not important at all. It doesn't bring any 'character' into Tracer and if it is replaced with something more fitting and FUN I don't mind.<br />
The actual problem is two fold.<br />
First, Blizzard actually showed, that bad PR that could have been escalated out of this by specific media is a weapon to be reckoned with, which will encourage more people getting offended over something and demanding it's removal, and, quite probably, harming the artistic direction of the product in the process. Yes, removal of the pose doesn't mean anything. But the precedent it creates may lead to more removals and cuts that may b, actually important.<br />
Second, it creates a problem withing the fanbase itself, when such minor things as a pose subjectively not fitting a character, gets more developer attention, than actual problems in Blizzard products.<br />
I have to admit, Overwatch devs were far more vocal and attentive to the community than, for example, WoW's (I'm looking at you Holy Paladin designers), but still, they are one company, though different teams, and this incident makes it look like bad PR is much more important to them, than the actual gameplay issues, and no, I'm not talking about the pose right now.</div></div><hr />

Just watch TotalBiscuit's video, it sums it up pretty well.<br />
<br />
<br />
That video is hilarious.<br />
<br />
That aside I think it's pretty cheesy to first implement a clearly sexual pose...and then scrap it again...and that we only see that kind of discussion when it comes to female characters(oh wait, big booties/boobs in spandex are sexistic...but dudes in tight muscle shirts or that show half of their muscled chest naked...that's just normal). Let's face it, many of those characters have been created from a very sexual Barbie/Ken point of view...one pose more or less won't change that.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To be fair, she does look like a cat on heat presenting herself, the pose is unnatural and is more sexualized than her character is portrayed as. The pose would be fine for a 'sexy' character, which im certain there will be, but not for a 'cute' character. that pose is pure fan service imo, so based solely on that im fine with it being changed<br />
<br />
Yes, but google for tracer and you will find a 100 pictures of her that look like Angelina Jolie when trying to seduce some guy in a movie. Her whole art is sexualized...from her super long legs to the way she is bending her hip to the side or back(so the upper chest jumps into your face). She is always more japanese anime college girl out for sex than &quot;innocent teenager&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I don't play the game. I don't give a shit one way or another, but in principle of it being removed BECAUSE a SJW said so, I absolutely abhor it. This has nothing to do with the actual subject of the content being removed or not, it's who did it and why.<br />
<br />
Two things can be true. An &quot;sjw&quot; can find fault with an art choice AND the dev team can be dissatisfied with the same pose enough to have alternates already available and under consideration. If you get stuck on &quot;abhor&quot; solely because of the &quot;sjw&quot;'s view, thats really being just as close-minded as they are.</div></div><hr />

Tracer's former &quot;sexy&quot; pose didn't bother me in the slightest, I just accepted it as a flash of flirty sexiness on the part of a spunky individual - but that aside, I can agree that the pose doesn't thematically fit the rest of the characterization of Tracer in general. I don't understand why someone would be offended by the pose in and of itself - for sexy it's rather tame, and I don't agree with the forum OP who thought it objectifying or somehow lessening the character itself. It just doesn't fit, and there are a variety of other poses that can demonstrate sexiness or flirting that better fit Tracer's portrayal everywhere else.<br />
<br />
I take the developers at their word that this was a point of contention even before complaints were leveled, and I can understand their position in re-doing it given that additional context. I just don't think there's an agenda at play here on Blizzard's part - whether there is one on the OP's I can't rightly say (nor does it really matter overly). The OP was either correct, or arrived at correct via the wrong path, but their criticism resonated with what the developers were already feeling and led to the result desired.</div></div><hr />

How many poses does each character have? 4, right? THEN USE ONE OF THE OTHER 3!<br />
<br />
Seriously, it's like people complaining that shop in-game items exist. Nobody's forcing you to use it, especially if all they sell are vanity items that have no influance on the game other then look; so if you're complaining that it exists at all it means you're nothing but a weak willed twonk who easily falls to temptation.<br />
<br />
So if you don't like staring at a woman's sexy butt, change it do that it doesn't show the sexy butt, instead to whining to devs and complaining you're offended by it. <br />
<br />
Also, who the hell buys a game that's rated 13+, for an 8 yer old kid? It's the parents that are to blame.<br />
It's like that BS complaint about wanting PG-13 version of Deadpool for a little kid.</div></div><hr />

Lets edit that, actually <br />
<br />
If the removal of a digital ass from a game ruins it for you THEN YOU ARE pretty fucking pathetic.<br />
<br />
The fact that a woman in the game has an ass and this ruins the game IS fucking pathetic.<br />
<br />
It is censorship. The End.<br />
<br />
It opens a precedent for worse stuff. That's even a bigger problem.<br />
<br />
Also that's a total judging of character based on a cloth/action. She can't be sexy or something else once, she can't be proud of her body or she is not a &quot;family girl&quot; anymore? Widowmaker can do that because the is a villain? Because she is not deemed a &quot;family girl&quot;? She is a &quot;beach&quot; anyways? That goes against all that people stands for nowadays.<br />
<br />
So we learn that is someone shows any small hint of being sexy once, they're villains? If they were good guys, they wouldn't do it? Like... religion freaks says?</div></div><hr />

I just ain't sure if using Lara is a smart choice here. I mean, she is like the pinnacle of a sexistic(tho strong) picture of women. Aside from Barbie she is likely the most criticized character when it comes to that. :cool:</div></div><hr />

If the Art Team removed this pose and replaced with another without answering to that mess of a over sensitive post because it wasn't fitting or... in my opinion, it isn't well done (the more i look at that pose, the more it look unnatural and poorly done) it would have been better...

Nope. Look at Smash Bros. for Wii U for example, there was always a fuss from the SJW's over Zero Suit Samus because of how she looks, especially when she got an alternate costume in shorts, right?

Not everyone agrees the victory pose was out of place. In fact 95% of the poll regarding the issue voted against changing it. Besides it was never the pose itself that was the big issue and I'm not sure why people defending Jeff keep insisting it was. Is it just a deflection tactic to make the argument seem unreasonable?</div></div><hr />

Why not add a new skin for Tracer... OK, google &quot;crazy redhead feminist&quot;. Make a skin for tracer that looks like that woman. That way the SJWs can revel in their new skin while killing male opponents. <br />
<br />
Oh, and they need to make Tracer immune to attacks from the male characters, because otherwise it promotes violence against women.</div></div><hr />

Look at Smash Bros. for Wii U for example, there was always a fuss from the SJW's over Zero Suit Samus because of how she looks, especially when she got an alternate costume in shorts, right?

It's all a bunch of crap, I don't know what happened to where this is a thing now, but it's sad.<br />
Oh yeah great, another case of &quot;social justice&quot;. And that comes from me, someone who despises Tracer. It's not about seeing tits and ass or whatever, it's about SJWs fucking shit up for everyone.</div></div><hr />

This isn't a sexy pose at all. If anything, just that her pants are treated like body paint makes it seem more sexual, but that has nothing to do with the pose itself. Maybe there is fabric that does that, but it seems like it would feel weird, but I am sure her model is consistent with the skintight pants at all time though, so this is a problem that comes with the design choice of those pants.</div></div><hr />

Well with those pointy elven features of theirs, you have a classic 'rapeface', so maybe that'll trigger the SJW mob. Or maybe the fact that only elves can be DHs, not pink haired gnomes, leading to the mob demanding, pitchforks in hand, that Blizzard extend it to all races.

<br />
I think this is really the heart of the issue. The majority of *self proclaimed* feminists tend to be incredibly unattractive and feel insecure when female characters or shows are attractive.<br />
<br />
I do, however, get it that she's not *meant* to be sexual but I can see her being flirty in a goofy kind of way.<br />
<br />
What this feels like is people *going out of their way* to feel insecure and make an issue. Very much how Lore handled the &quot;Tyrande's Silence&quot; in an obvious SJW way. In my opinion people overreacted just to be an SJW. He responded in the &quot;I don't want the feminazi army upon me!&quot; way.<br />
<br />
Now, since there seems to be misunderstanding of SJW. An SJW is someone who gets upset over seemingly silly things merely because it's against women. It's not about equality. It's not about non-sexualizing women. It's like people who think cat calling women is harassment (hint: it's not, and if it were we would live in a society where I could arrest you because you didn't like how you responded to my post and I was 'offended' and you'll go to jail).<br />
<br />
I can see how they can feel like they went out of their way to show her ass though but I think he responded in the &quot;omg, I need to back peddle full speed&quot; kind of tone -- which is what set some people off to the &quot;oh, so we're just going to cater to every person who can't handle life..?&quot;<br />
<br />
Truth be told, I really wish our society would embrace sexuality more. If I didn't know any better I'd say feminist would be happier in Iraq or Afghanistan where they don't show their bodies. Yes, my statement also implies showing more male ass, thighs, chests, etc. But when was the last time you saw a male getting upset at an obvious overly buff male? FMA Armstrong anyone? Anyone EVER get upset over that? No? Only women get upset over attractive women? So why can't everyone appreciate a beautiful body whether it's sexual, playful, or whatever? Why is it always women especially and the SJW crowd so easily upset over *just* women? When was the last time they went after a CK ad over a man with six pack and underwear?<br />
<br />
That being said... I didn't even notice her ass until someone pointed it out. Hell I didn't notice Tyrande's ass until a HotS game loading screen (that part where they teleport in). Next game I rotated her and... damn 'dat ass. I'm more of a boob man myself though so... to each their own. My best friend (chick) is an thigh / leg woman. I, on the other hand, fucking hate leg days at the gym and could care less for having massive quads. heh.</div></div><hr />

You've missed the point, the pose is (1) not the best -according to Blizzard -they have for Tracer and (2) internally -at Blizzard -the pose was debated and now confirmed by public that the pose / silhouette is not befitting Tracer's character. As per the second point, of whether the decision to change it is a prudish one is subjective, but the decision has been made openly and with fair reasoning.<br />
<br />
Personally I think it's the right decision too.<br />
<br />
As per the WoW stuff... well maybe WoW is a bit darker than Overwatch, and the demons you're quoting there have a sadist/masochistic vibe going on there (pleasure/pain) so the sexual vibe fits. As far as I can see, there's no place for that (yet) in Overwatch or its character set.</div></div><hr />

One whining feminist is not the equivalent to being &quot;confirmed by the public.&quot; There's been more outcry against the change than there was in support of it.

Yeah I said the same thing. We could have the guys completely naked safe for maybe a pair of glasses, with their dicks waggling left and right and none of these SJWs would complain. But if we get an angle where we can see the covered ass of a woman and now that's terrible.<br />

Do these people really don't have anything better to complain about? It's like when vegans complained that fish bladder is used in the procution of Guiness.

There's no deflection here. The argument isn't just unreasonable, it's flat out stupid. If you want a character who flaunts her sexuality, you still have Widowmaker, Blizzard has made no moves to remove or alter that - the sexiness of the pose doesn't fit the character they've portrayed in all of the marketing so far.

Misquote? It was taken straight from your post. You were implying the pose was sexualizing Tracer and if that's what we wanted we should go to widowmaker instead.<br />

<br />
I think you missed the point too then...<br />
<br />
Because widowmaker is just as, if not more sexual/revealing than Tracer is. The point was that it didn't fit &quot;Tracer's&quot; character. I think according to the blue post the decision was twofold.<br />
<br />
(1) Didn't fit her character as well as another pose. To fit the fun, cutesy, shy personality being established.<br />
<br />
*Personally I question her outfit at all then* if she isn't trying to be sexy/flirtatious why would she wear something so form fitting?*<br />
http://www.marveldirectory.com/pictures/individuals/r_1d/rogue/rogue1.gif I mean this is basically the model/inspiration.<br />
<br />
(2) (and you have to read between the lines a bit here) The character as being defined as a &quot;main character&quot; if that is the case she needs to appeal to a wide range of fans, and oversexualizing her will turn people away. Its a marketing decision just as much as it is a design decision.<br />
<br />
That being said, no where are they stating the sexuality or sexiness does not have its place in the game... because clearly (again Widowmaker) that isn't the case.<br />

The only thing I see wrong with the picture is that it looks like there's too much leg and not enough butt. Meaning the butt isn't defined enough to not see it as just being the rest of her leg.<br />
<br />
Other than that, I see nothing wrong with it. It's just kind of like a taunt. Small children sometimes shake their asses at each other as a taunt if they have won something or want to start a fight. It's kind of like &quot;Kiss my ass, I won&quot;<br />
That said I can see why Blizzard wouldn't use the pose for Tracer because I'm sure she's a good sport and wouldn't taunt someone like that. <br />
<br />
As for the picture being &quot;demeaning&quot; for women. Idfc. I'm a woman and I really could care less. But I'm also an artist and see stuff from an artistic standpoint.<br />

It was taken straight from your post. You were implying the pose was sexualizing Tracer and if that's what we wanted we should go to widowmaker instead.<br />
<br />
So once again, you're saying showing your backside is sexualization. Ergo, you must be very sheltered. Or do you just cover your eyes when you go outside?<br />
<br />
Well if only we were all as pure minded and innocent as you. Forgive me if, when a woman poses in such a way as to bring her ass to prominence in front of a camera, the more base and rather crass part of my subconscious thinks &quot;man, I'd like to tap dat&quot;.<br />
<br />
In all seriousness though, I was alluding to the original complaint: <br />
<br />
<br />
WHAT? What about this pose has anything to do with the character you're building in tracer? It's not fun, its not silly, it has nothing to do with being a fast elite killer. It just reduces tracer to another bland female sex symbol. <br />

<br />
I have no issue at all with sexy poses, but I don't see any beefcake-style male poses. Therefore what we have, in this case, is just one kind of sexy . . .the kind based on traditional het-male ideas of sexuality. If we are doing sexy, then lets be a little more progressive about it. <br />
<br />
One last point: This is a game with a cartoon-y look that has a talking gorilla and cool robots. That sexy pose seems just completely out of place in it, to me.</div></div><hr />

There's literally nothing overtly sexual about that pose, and even if there is, why is that a problem? She's wearing an outfit that seems all but DESIGNED to show off her bottom. Why wouldn't she want you to look at it? Just because the trivial character development we have for her so far doesn't show her flirting? I have no problem at all with the idea of Tracer flirting, and it doesn't harm any other aspect of the character. Again, though, just looks like she was facing one way, and then decided to look at someone behind her without turning around to be snarky over the victory.<br />
<br />
This feels like one person decided they knew this character better than the person at Blizzard that designed that pose, and Blizzard caved because we must protect da womyns from any and all potential offensiveness, no matter how minor.<br />

That's a completely moronic thing to say about this game. Have you SEEN Widowmaker? She's pure sex appeal. She's the seductress assassin that'll use her body as a weapon every time. Make your arguments against Tracer having the pose all you want, but this is NOT an asexual game.</div></div><hr />

Except that what they did wasnt caving or pandering?!?!?!?!<br />
<br />
Do you even know what that is?<br />
Pandering is modifying your behavior to specifically cater to certain demographic.<br />
Caving is giving up on something because of pressure.<br />
<br />
The person brought up a legitimate concern based on real issues, like the established lore of the character and the fact that no one ever ever<br />
ever poses like that unless its a model or porn star showing off their butt.<br />
<br />
<br />
Except that they DID cave-in based on a minority view? Pandering, no not really, but caving, yes.<br />
<br />
I have an idea, let's remove all aesthetics from the game because anything can possibly be a trigger for someone else. Widowmaker is too sexy. McCree smokes, that's a bad influence. Roadhog is fat. Bastion is a weapon of mass destruction. On and on and on. Every character should be put in a burlap sack and be given water pistols... because nobody can be sexy, cool, handsome, robotic, talking-gorilla, and nobody can use actual violence/explosives/bullets...<br />
<br />
Do you see that this kind of stupidity effectively has no end? Is Blizz going to bend when anyone complains about anything?</div></div><hr />

You are aware that sexuality, eroticism and pornography aren't the same thing and only related to each other, right?<br />
<br />
There is a distinction between full-on porn and a tight body suit. You're basically generalizing and saying no sexy thing can be anything but porn which is a very archaic and regressive way of seeing sexuality, on top of being a fallacy. <br />
<br />
Sexuality as a trait and not a focus is realistic, because believe it or not, people can like sexy things or sexuality without being total pervs, it is a very real part of what makes us humans. You can find a man/woman attractive without instantly going for the &quot;gonna get inside of her&quot; perspective. But I'm sorry that your apparently lacklustre comprehension of that thing you're so adamant on talking about is making you say silly things. The main problem with many aspects of current pop-culture is that sex is used in demeaning, controlling or marketing manners, not as something that humanity should see as what it really is: a part of us as a species.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
While I think many of you became saltier than the Dead Sea over this rather trivial matter, the OP could have turned into a very interesting conversation without the involvement of the less emotionally balanced posters. It's made very obvious that neither side - omitting certain specific individuals - can and welcomes any form of debate, more so they strive to perpetuate and enlarge their echo chamber built upon hyperbole and name calling. Both of you radical bunch of cutes are why we can't have nice things - but please, keep thinking it's all because of the other side.<br />

I don't see you trying to get guys to put a shirt on. I see tons of ripped guys in entertainment. When I'm watching a movie with my gf and the dude takes off his shirt and is ripped I do feel a bit insecure and I bet my gf is checking him out and thinking hot damn.

When you look at that pose of Tracer where do your eyes fall within 2 secs of looking at it?? This is how marketing works. <br />
Notice how Zarya doesn't have a pose like this??? It's cause she looks like a dike and men don't want to see a butch lesbian in a pose drawn in a way that extenuates her big muscled ass. Notice how there are no poses of any of the male characters that show off their crotch or ass like this. There is a reason Tracer was picked as the &quot;face of the game&quot;, cause shes young, attractive and wearing skin tight clothing. <br />
Now i'm not saying that any of this is wrong, but please lets stop lying to ourselves about how we can't understand why someone might be offended by this. To any guy that says women should just get over it and stop being such a prudes about it then you obviously have never had to experience what its like to be treated as nothing more than a hole to put your dick when the mood strikes. You know why a lot of men are homophobes??? Because they fear being treated by men the way they treat women.</div></div><hr />

That aside I think it's pretty cheesy to first implement a clearly sexual pose...and then scrap it again...and that we only see that kind of discussion when it comes to female characters(oh wait, big booties/boobs in spandex are sexistic...but dudes in tight muscle shirts or that show half of their muscled chest naked...that's just normal). Let's face it, many of those characters have been created from a very sexual Barbie/Ken point of view...one pose more or less won't change that.<br />

Yes, but google for tracer and you will find a 100 pictures of her that look like Angelina Jolie when trying to seduce some guy in a movie. Her whole art is sexualized...from her super long legs to the way she is bending her hip to the side or back(so the upper chest jumps into your face). She is always more japanese anime college girl out for sex than &quot;innocent teenager&quot;.<br />
<br />
you talking about fan art? or concept art? Cos personally see the character as ... sex hungry... in her concept art, i mean you can be flirty without being seductive (really getting into specifics with this). most of her art is 'playful' and perhaps even bordering on 'flirtatious' but the pose in question seemed more 'seductive' than 'playful'.<br />
<br />
as for sexualized body type, i imagine its harder to not make a girl sexualized than it is to make one, since girls are just generally sexy, unless you purposefully add in warts and pimples and shit... i think oversized unrealistic tits (eg every anime ever) and skin tight pants/miniskirts are red flags for sexualization, i suppose tracer has one of those, and big lips...<br />
<br />
dunno...<br />
SJWs always complain about this shit, but more often than not both chicks and dudes alike prefer sexy female characters, chicks want to play as sexy and desirable characters while guys want to play with characters they want to fuck (i find it embarrassing half the time) same with males, guys play what they want to be (strong, fit, fast etc, or in WoWs case, pretty (damn elves)). Then occasionally we get outliers that exist almost specifically to appease the SJW types, unattractive/masculine females and shit.<br />

Using the team Social Justice Warrior shows that you think plp who stand up for what they think is wrong are all just a bunch of whiners and hippies who should just grow a pair...right? <br />
This kind of mindset is why Trump has a following. If only we could go back to &quot;the good ol days&quot;. The &quot;good ol days&quot; were never good in the first place, so stop looking at the past with rose tinted glasses. Change only happens when plp speak up about it. The fact that you don't like or just probably fear change is something you should take a look at.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So hurting someones feelings isn't a big deal? Wonder how you'd feel if I said something to make your mother cry, or your sister or daughter. You only say that these things don't matter because your not personally invested. Its easy to say who cares about X or Y when it has no direct impact on your day to day life. I have a daughter and I don't ever want her to think that she has to use her sexuality to be accepted and that her only worth to a man is to be a some bitch that he sticks his dick into. <br />
If the male characters in the game were posed to show them off and something to fuck then you'd just have guys ranting about how it looks gay and don't turn 76 into some Blood Elf fag.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So the problem is the outfit, not the pose. The character wears spandex and you expect her to hide her rear? That makes no sense whatsoever.<br />
<br />
If the problem is the way her hips are splayed out to the side, well she does that in EVERY pose, so still not a problem with this specific pose but with her ESTABLISHED PERSONALITY.<br />
<br />
So, yes, Hanzo and Tracer are doing as exactly the same pose they can within the confines of their character traits and choices of garb.<br />
<br />
I would say nice try, just to throw that back at you, but it really wasn't.</div></div><hr />

HAHAHA if your trying to compair the Hanzo pose to the Tracer pose then you need to smoke more crack. Your eyes don't fall to Hanzo's ass 2 secs after seeing his pose. Hanzo's out fit is far from form fitting. Don't even try to use that as your argument. As for the emotional health of your family......ugh.....i dunno man. VOTE TRUMP!!!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Couple things:<br />
<br />
A) If Tracer standing in at best a minutely sexual pose effects your day to day, you're a pathetic example of an adult and need to go live in a padded room somewhere.<br />
<br />
B) Men are not portrayed in the same sexualizing manner as women because the things that make men sexy to women (or anybody else that likes traditional &quot;man&quot;-ness) are completely different. The physiological cues that, thanks to evolution, most men look for in women are characteristics that show them to be able to reliably bear and care for their potential offspring. The things that women naturally look for in men are things that make them seem capable of protecting and providing for the woman and any children that arise. As a result, men are shown as powerful warriors, hunters, gatherers, survivors in general. They're still also frequently shown barely clothes, exposing all manner of bulging muscles and skin, drenched in sweat and looking ready to pounce, whether that the be pouncing on an animal/enemy to attack, or pouncing on a woman for some hot primal sexy-time.<br />
<br />
None of this changes that every single character is idealized beyond possibility, but people only care when it happens to women.</div></div><hr />

So, your problem is with Tracer's outfit right? I mean the pose isn't what makes her pants contour to the curves of her ass. They always do that. Complain about the thing that you have a problem with. Otherwise, if the pose is the problem, Hanzo and Tracer ARE doing the same thing. Change Tracer's clothes and there's no problem.</div></div><hr />

No doubt.... Was about to pre-order this but if Blizzard and Jeff Cuckland removes a pose due to a fucking complaint... I will wait till it hits the bargain bin because if they give in to ONE COMPLAINT due to the game what else Blizzard will remove (as now it's opened the floodgates) because Person A doesn't like this characters action cause it goes against his &quot;imaginary persona&quot; or Person B doesn't like how one character is acting. <br />
Create the game in your vision not for some ONE who gets offended by one pose, she's 26 for fucks sake, she's independent and will use her assets to show off that you got beaten by a sexy girl, so a spunky girl now can't be sassy cause they &quot;played&quot; the character guess what Jeff Cuckland that person did not create the character and you now HARMED the artistic vision of that characters creator cause of the beta tester, you better be paying the person who CREATED TRACER TRIPLE WAGE from now on.</div></div><hr />

I know your annoyed but I would refrain from completely believing that they done this to please one person overall. The problem of late is that no one really ever gave 2 shits about overwatch and people were going about there business until this controversy popped up and then everyone suddenly cared, remember &quot;Any publicity stunt whether good or bad is still great publicity&quot; and I think Jeff Cuckland has pulled it off wonderfully.<br />
<br />
I didn't even know Overwatch existed of late until this event popped up... but then I still stand by my rule. If the game sells remarkably well, Jeff better pay that Tracer Character designer triple wage for sacrificing his artistic vision for the great good or get a massive bonus for matyr her.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And the most annoying thing is that now there seem not to be any other topic.<br />
<br />
I find it rather digusting that so many female characters are reduced to eye candy and even grosser things. Yes, I have a dirty mind myself, and guess what, it does not need a slutty presentation of a character (male or female) to be activated. I can have sex symbols who are dressed perfectly fine, in fact I prefer these types over any kind of sluts. Exceptions to the rule are characters who are created with this concept in mind, like Jessica Rabbit or the whores from Cin City for example. And I don't see Tracer being that kind of character. She can possibly be playfully-naughty, but it's not the main focus of this character type. Tomboyish girls are their own kind of sex symbol, they don't need a tight spandex around their asses to be sexy.<br />
<br />
Besides my personal preferences: The thing is, many of this sexual objectification happens in the heads of people, and it will happen no matter what. Clad a girl in a burka and let the fabric fall exactly the way it shows all the interesting contours with the right kind of light, sinking down between her breasts and thighs, and you will fire up imagination. Same goes for a guy with an attractive body. So removing a pose will not help at all when people tend to be aroused by a myriad of things. Especially in the case that anybody with some basic Google skill can find fanart which is much more explicit.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I am very annoyed by all this. It's a truly pointless discussion, especially because Tracer and the whole game (which is still in development, so subject to change) belongs to Blizzard and it's ultimately THEIR decision how they want to present a character.</div></div><hr />
