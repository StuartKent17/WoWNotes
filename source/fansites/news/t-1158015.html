Heart of Fear: Amber-Shaper Un'sok<br />
Today we take a look at Amber-Shaper Un'sok, the fifth boss of the Heart of Fear raid.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/EgKNpSW3epE&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
Heart of Fear<br />
The Sha of Fear has corrupted the grand empress of the mantid. Her increasingly erratic and paranoid commands have driven the Klaxxi--the keepers of mantid culture--to take aggressive action. Because they are few in number, the Klaxxi are reluctantly willing to accept outside help in destroying the empress and purging their race of the sha's negative influence.<br />
<br />
Amber-Shaper Un'sok<br />
Achievements<br />
<br />
I Heard You Like Amber... (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/6518) - Kill Living Amber in Burning Amber until at least 8 pools overlap, and then defeat Amber-Shaper Un'sok on Normal or Heroic difficulty in Heart of Fear.<br />
Heroic: Amber-Shaper Un'sok (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/6729) - Defeat Amber-Shaper Un'sok in Heart of Fear on Heroic difficulty.<br />
<br />
<br />
Encounter<br />
<br />
Stage One: Worthy Test Subjects?<br />
<br />
Amber Scalpel (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/121994) - Un'sok carves the ground with a focused beam of pure amber energy. The beam inflicts 20,000 Nature damage every 0.25 sec. at the point of contact, and leaves behind Molten Amber residue. The residue inflicts 27,500 Fire damage every 1 sec. to players who touch it. Some of this residue congeals into Living Amber oozes.<br />
<br />
Living Amber (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/123498) - Each of these animated amber oozes focuses mindlessly on a random player, emanating a Corrosive Aura that inflicts 1,600 Nature damage every 2 sec to all players. Each ooze Bursts in a shower of amber when destroyed, inficting 45,500 Nature damage to enemies within 8 yards and healing any other Living Amber within that radius for 0% of their maximum health. In Heroic difficulty, dissolved Living Amber will reconstitute after 30 seconds. In Looking for Raid difficulty, destroying a Living Amber does not heal other nearby Living Amber.<br />
<br />
Burning Amber (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/122504) - When a Living Amber is destroyed, it dissolves into a pool that deals 31,000 Fire damage every 1 sec to all enemies within 3 yards.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/healer.png&quot; title=&quot;Healer&quot; /&gt; Parasitic Growth (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/121949) - Amber-Shaper Un'sok causes amber to grow within the body of a random target, inflicting 16,250 Nature damage every 2 sec. This strain of amber absorbs healing energy, increasing the damage it inflicts to its host in direct proportion to any healing received. After 30 sec, the unstable parasite dissipates without a trace.<br />
Reshape Life (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/122370) - Un'sok unleashes a torrent of amber at a player, transforming the target into a misshapen mass of flowing amber that is hostile to players and monsters alike.<br />
<br />
Mutated Construct - While transformed, the player continuously expends Willpower to retain control over the twisted form, at the rate of 2 per second, beginning with a maximum of 100. When Willpower runs out, the player dies and the Mutated Construct continues to act, uncontrolled.<br />
<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/deadly.png&quot; title=&quot;Deadly&quot; /&gt; Amber Explosion (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/122398) - The amber encircling the mutated player compels the unleashing of a massive explosion, inflicting 120,000 Nature damage to all players.<br />
Amber Strike (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/122389) - The construct inflicts 250,000 Nature damage to the current hostile target and interrupts normal spellcasting. This includes a target's attempt to trigger an Amber Explosion. Amber Strike also destabilizes the target, increasing damage taken by 10% for 10 sec. This effect stacks.<br />
Break Free (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/123060) - Once the physical form of the amber construct has been damaged to 20% of its remaining health, the player can break free with a great surge of will. The player then regains their natural form.<br />
Consume Amber (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/123156) - A transformed player consumes a pool of Burning Amber left behind by a defeated Living Amber. The consumption restores 20 Willpower, but also bolsters the mutated form, increasing its current and maximum health by 4,500,000.<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/important.png&quot; title=&quot;Important&quot; /&gt; Struggle for Control (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/122395) - With a surge of will, the player expends 8 Willpower to force the mutated form to cease all action for 0.5 sec. This also increases the mutated form's damage taken by 100% for the 5 sec.<br />
Smash (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/122960) - Transformed players use this simple melee attack in lieu of their normal attack, inflicting 40,000 Physical damage to a target.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Stage Two: Un'sok's Greatest Creation - When Un'sok reaches 60% remaining health, he calls forth a massive Amber Monstrosity to fight beside him. Un'sok continues to attack with his full arsenal of abilities from Stage One.<br />
<br />
Amber Monstrosity - Un'sok formed this towering behemoth entirely of flowing amber, and it stands as a triumph of Un'sok's research into creating life from the mantids' amber.<br />
<br />
Amber Explosion (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/122402) - The Monstrosity releases a massive explosion of amber energy, inflicting 140,000 Nature damage to all players.<br />
Massive Stomp (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/122408) - The Monstrosity stomps the ground forcefully, inflicting 97,500 Physical damage to all enemies within 15 yards and knocking them back.<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/tank.png&quot; title=&quot;Tank&quot; /&gt; Fling (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/122413) - The Monstrosity grabs its current target in one of its massive hands and hurls the hapless victim at a distant player, causing 81,250 Physical damage to targets within 0 yards of the point of impact and stunning them for 3 sec.<br />
<br />
Amber Carapace (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/122540) - While the Amber Monstrosity lives, an Amber Carapace shields Amber-Shaper Un'sok. The Carapace reduces his damage taken by 90%.<br />
<br />
Stage Three: Un'sok Unleashed - Upon witnessing the destruction of his greatest creation, Un'sok channels power from the amber pools lining his chamber and prepares to make his final stand. Un'sok no longer uses Amber Scalpel, but now casts Reshape Life with greatly increased frequency.<br />
<br />
Concentrated Mutation (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/122556) - Un'sok draws massive amounts of amber energy into his body, increasing his damage dealt by 50% and attack speed by 50%.<br />
Volatile Amber (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/123198) - Un'sok's siphoning agitates the pools of amber around the room, causing them to periodically emit bursts of amber that fly through the air at high velocity. Each amber burst inflicts 29,250 Nature damage to any player it strikes. If a missile strikes a player while they are transformed into a Mutated Construct, it heals them for 20% of their health.<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/heroic.png&quot; title=&quot;Heroic&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/deadly.png&quot; title=&quot;Deadly&quot; /&gt; Amber Globule - Un'sok causes two spheres of destructive amber to form from the pools at the edges of the room, each of which fixates on a random player. If an Amber Globule comes into contact with its primary target, it explodes, dealing 600,000 Nature damage to all players within 30 yards. If two Amber Globules touch each other, their energies will neutralize and dissipate harmlessly.<br />

<br />
Computers - Setup of the Month (by chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud))<br />
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud) will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
Hard drive prices are slowly declining, but are still above the pre-flood prices, so now is still a good time to buy a SSD. The current SSD prices are still slowly moving downward (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/july/ssdgraph.gif), with many under $1 per gigabyte now. A few sales are even nearing 50 cents per gigabyte, so look for something on sale!<br />

If you are building today and don't go for the upper range of overclocking (past ~4.5Ghz) then you are better off buying Ivy Bridge. If you want to go for the maximum overclocks or have to save money, the 2500k (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004EBUXHQ?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004EBUXHQ) is $25 cheaper. Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 3770K and should spend that money elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date.<br />

it looks like we have him to thank for some of our tier sets. It also looks like though, UNFORTUNATELY, his skill at conveying his art on paper far exceeds some of the 3D modeling artist's capacities. He even made the hunter Tier 10 look awesome for crying out loud! I think the biggest thing that doesn't translate over too well would be all the 3d armor detail in the pics, vs the skins we get on our characters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's a difference. <br />
<br />
Blizzard made profit with their Annual Pass offering from their own products; Curse on the other hand is &quot;selling&quot; you keys which aren't theirs to sell in the first place and were probably given to fan sites to distribute them freely, and yes &quot;sign-up fast for curse premium and receive this and this beta key&quot; is pretty much telling you - pay and you get the key. <br />
<br />
Now I don't even care, but wonder what ArenaNet thinks of this.</div></div><hr />
