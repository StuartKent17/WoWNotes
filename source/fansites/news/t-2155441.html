Tier 20 armor sets are here! They may look familiar, as many of them are inspired by the Tier 6 armor sets. 
 
Keep in mind that this is an early preview. Sets may be unfinished, missing pieces, and missing colors. 
 
Take a look at them in the modelviewer for the full picture, especially Mythic Druid and Warlocks (use the Jump Start animation).

Those are probably for the pvp sets. The epic pvp gear are recolors of Tier sets. (S1 and S2 of legion's being T19 for example). So bad luck most likely</div></div><hr />

To be fair, if you think it's just a &quot;few pixels&quot; updated, you really need to check back at what the sets looked like previously.</div></div><hr />

Yeah...that's a negative. I have despised almost all new tier sets artwork since MoP came out. Most tiers have one or two sets I think look good. I end up using the same shit from vanilla and TBC for the most part. So for me I'm fucking thrilled to see this. In fact if they wanted to give up on doing new art and just gave every tier a revamp from previous expansions I'd be fine. The old artists had something different about their art. And obviously many prefer it. <br />
<br />
To call these people fanboys is hilarious.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
And where will we be able to get these?<br />
<br />
It's tier 20 so next patch in Tomb of Sargeras raids.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Do we really need all this &quot;TBC HQ&quot; sets? That's why DH/Monk sets are the best here.<br />
<br />
Funny, the monk one is hilariously ugly. DH looks great though. Blizzard said they were gonna do this ages ago it's no surprise. They can see by transmog data that most players who transmog are using old sets from vanilla thru WotLK and tier 6 in particular is the most used.</div></div><hr />

Tier 6 was an obvious choice, it was a popular tier with all the BC players. Tomb of Sargeras also seems to be following in the foot steps of Black Temple somewhat. That said, I kind of wish there was an alternate way to acquire these and current raid drops remained original.<br />
<br />
As an Alliance Druid, tier 6 isn't my favorite. It was clearly styled for Tauren Druids and not Night Elves. I guess it's fair though, because the current tier is 100% styled for Night Elves and not Tauren.</div></div><hr />

Never understood hype around mage's T6, IMHO, it looks like garbage, and new T20 is quite meh too. DH set is meh, skirts can burn in fire, Pala set is... weird, I don't like that it's soo monochromatic. I'd say that's my biggest issue w/ T20, many sets, e.g. mage, pala tiers, are way too monochromatic, they lack contrast.<br />

<br />
Damn yeah you re right! Some even cover the face! WOAAAAAAH!! <br />
And that paladin tier is literally straight up trash they didnt even update the t6 model. Same &quot;painted on skin&quot; pants even though we have new 3d pant models and same ugly ass boot model from tbc with the painted texture on it.<br />
I can hardly call most of these a &quot;hd rework&quot;. Most of them are exactly the same with very tiny things changing.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Inb4 &quot;OMG its just datamined!!! Dont you remember that one death knight tier that changed slightly compared to its datamined model like once?&quot; <br />
Yeah these are the final things. And the paladin one is straight up filth. Dont get me wrong I m a fan of t6 and the red recolor looks pretty good. But the textures didnt even change its the same old &quot;painted on skin&quot; shit.</div></div><hr />

Everything looks really nice and there is a reason that T6 was so loved because almost all of them looked great, rather than just one or two that look decent now. Priest set looks great although I'm not too keen on the mythic version, but only because they don't have the dark blue color like the non mythic. Even Monk has a good looking set for once in forever. DH one looks alright and the DK's looks pretty nice too, so the classes that didn't have them fit rather well in the good looking department with how T6 was.<br />
<br />
I can see why people would consider this lazy, but Blizz gave what people were asking for and unfortunately for those that don't like this you are most likely in the minority. It is certainly not being a &quot;fan boi&quot; to like something.</div></div><hr />

Just so you know, they cant reskin old models and make them look HD... they literally have to create them from scrap to look like the old ones. :P<br />

Dude, you have no fucking idea what you are talking about. It means nothing nowadays that you are a hardcore raider. This is the least that they can get for their efforts. I've been a hardcore raider and you have to spend a lot of time in this stupid game. Stop being a fucking bitch and moan about everything that casual scrubs dont get that hardcore players do. You cant get everything served ready on your table with no efforts from yourself. That is why people started hating the game because everything is ready for you to grab without any effort. And for fuck sake, the mythic set is barely any different from the normal one, stop bitching.<br />

And also, to everyone whining that some sets are shit. THIS IS EARLY PREVIEW. And they did say that T20 will be T6 HEAVILY INSPIRED.

There has been a lot of just terrible sets in the last couple of years, and this is probably the first time in a long while that I can say; I don't hate any of them. The DK one is underwhelming, but Tier 19 was really great for Death Knights, while pretty bad for a couple of other classes. The Demon Hunter one is from the concept art, I didn't expect to ever see it in game. The Monk one, while not perfect (some of the items are using old/underwhelming models, like the pants and legs), has awesome gloves, which is important for a weaponless warrior, and Blizzard has FINALLY given us a set that actually represents us. We're not just all about balls, we also have Gods and a legacy of Mogu rule. It's nice to see a Celestial, the Shado-Pan and the Mogu colors represented in an item set, after years of generic Monk sets. It's unfortunate that the necklace isn't seperated from the mask, but the gloves and shoulders will be great for transmogs.<br />
<br />
I read through the comments everytime there's a new tier set, and I don't think Blizzard will ever be able to satisfy everyone. We all see beauty in different things. To me the attention to detail, the quality of the textures, and how they're fitted on the model, matter most. I would never play an asymmetrical model with poor armor fitting, because it matters too much to me, but I know that some people don't care, or just see things completely differently. I was kinda surprised that people were calling the Hunter mount ugly, as it has great textures and detail, is an original model, and in my opinion uses a great skeleton for run+flight mount (the wyvern).</div></div><hr />

You literally said that you are sad that you cant look as cool as hardcore raiders in-game.<br />
<br />
And YES, they can mean whatever by HEAVILY INSPIRED, stop trying to be smart, because you are obviously not.<br />
<br />
Totally agree that Mythic should reward something special for which people who dont put effort in have to wait for an expac to get it. <br />
But that shit is just a lazy ass largely made worse recolour which isnt what is ok for new content. (Might as well go back to the black temple to wear that.</div></div><hr />

Seriously. I loved the current tier set and was hoping it would continue in that direction of quality, but nope :/ lets remake the fugliest set with fucking eyeballs and shit which isn't remotely hunter related. Fuck yeah I am salty.<br />
<br />
Same here Dx it's so fugly! Who thought bringing back hunter T6 was a good idea?! I don't know really any hunters hat like it. I don't mind the animal skulls and such but big creepy moving eyes = nope for me. Only sets I really like are Druid and monk :)</div></div><hr />

This has been common knowledge for a LONG time. Heaps of people were desperate for the old tier 6 stuff to be updated, and instead Blizz did this. And honestly they pretty much all look sick. Rather than &quot;this looks shit&quot; i'd like to hear some constructive criticism on which look bad and why.<br />
<br />
If you looks at dk, paladin, warrior tier 19 sets they look much better than this. This look like a cheap high textured model, I think they did not have much time they could spend on it. I know it's an early preview but I remember warrior tier 18 was an early preview and it did not change at all.<br />
If you look at tier 19 the level of datails and how these armor are massive like proper plates compared to this you'll understand why these are just cheap models. They look as bad as order hall sets.</div></div><hr />

Ahahaha, thanks man , you really made my morning :D or however you choose to self-identify ;) no judgement here, buddy ;)<br />
If you're retarded enough to eat any shit that you're served - well sucks to be you :) I'm well aware I'm smart , and it's because of this, that I have other RL obligations and I can't spend most of my evenings wiping on bosses. I'm more than able to clear mythic one tier behind though. The fact that you suggested that I would have to wait a whole expac, does tell me that this is what you gonna be doing. But that's not really my concern :)<br />
And no heavily inspired cannot mean a recolour you Moron . To inspire means: to Fill (someone) with the urge or ability to do or feel something, especially to do something creative; to create (a feeling, especially a positive one) in a person. To recolours means: colour again or differently. Hence heavily inspired means that they would take t6 , use it as base and do something creative with it. Paladin t19 is heavily inspired by paladin Tier 2. Paladin tier 20 is a HD recolour of T6. It really isnt that hard.<br />

People like you fucking disgust me. I've stopped playing the game for a while now and I dont &quot;eat any shit&quot;. You are the one complaining about the contend of the game, and you are going to probably be the one &quot;eating the shit&quot; as you called it, because you'll keep playing it. I've heard that shit &quot;I've got more important things to do in my life than playing video games&quot;. Well good for you, buddy, other people are maybe making a living off the game somehow and maybe they deserve more shiny shit than you because they spend more time in it.<br />
You are acting and talking like a child. Stop comparing yourself to others in the game and stop comparing to what they get and what you get, like children do. You say that you are not interested in the conversation, yet, you continue to reply.<br />

When only one difficulty gets an &quot;original&quot; armour, while the rest get a more polished version of an already existing one? Oh wow. Ever pondered removing the blinders? :P<br />
<br />
And here's me thinking we couldn't get worse than getting a recolouring version instead of an actual original type of armour per each raid\difficulty. But with fans like the above, where's the surprise that the path of least resistance is being taken every time it's possible.</div></div><hr />

Tier 6 was a great, universally loved set and it's good to see t20 inspired by it. <br />

I see some people using the tired and banal &quot;people just can't be pleased, we asked for this and now we got it and people complain!&quot;.<br />
<br />
You're confused. You asked for it. So did some other people that like this. This is not what &quot;everyone&quot; asked for and certainly not what everyone wanted.<br />
<br />
Some of the sets look good - excellent upgrades to old sets. But using them for a whole &quot;new&quot; tier? It's a joke. When someone told me they were being &quot;inspired by&quot; I was expecting something mostly new with some throwbacks to the originals, not the originals with a little touch of new here and there.<br />
<br />
But this definitely isn't the worst tier. There are some shockers out there, I'm just surprised they managed to take some things that were good and make them look bad. I think the new sets are pretty bad too, the monk set is the worst set out all of them shown. Priest is definitely a winner for me - I'm going to be stalking priests later this year.</div></div><hr />

The above notion is indeed why I'm feeling rather underwhelmed with these sets.<br />
<br />
Are they nice and with quality? Yes.<br />
<br />
But I would rather see these on an appropriate expansion time-walking rewards, instead of feeling rather out of place on such an iconic area such as Tier Armor.<br />

Do note, I'm mainly speaking about the &quot;very similar to T6&quot; Non-Mythic versions. Most of the Mythic versions actually have some uniqueness to it and could pass as new. Maybe with some having theme adjustments to match the current theme.</div></div><hr />

How in the hell do those fit a hunter, and which creature did they come from? Kobold babies?<br />
This tier is, for Hunters, a completely missed opportunity to make a great and worthy remake of a wonderful old set. Sorely disappointed.</div></div><hr />

Even though these are rehashings of the old Tier-6. Blizzard clearly lacks the passion it had. Wheres the love when making these models? Who sits there and goes, lets remake the old model by adding a few things here and there? You'd think that any artist would spend a good amount of time and effort into something like this even if its a re-do. Millions of people will be using this gear and they think a little addition or color here and there would make it better? Even for a remake of Tier-6 there is no creativity left in blizzard to add something new to the old models, there is no WOW factor to these.</div></div><hr />

I sort of wish they'd just taken time to go back and refresh the old tiers - maybe to tie in with timewalking raids or the like.</div></div><hr />

Press the modelviewer button, view as your preferred race. Human male is the only model that displays the textures without them being stretched.</div></div><hr />

I've noticed a trend with armor sets having an overly stressed and bulky look. So much so that even cloth gear looks like plate. Dont get me wrong i like larger than life armor sets, and, readability is good. But, i feel like the subtlety of the older sets is completely lost here.</div></div><hr />

For the sake of nostalgia there could have redone the sets in actual BT if they wanted to do that.<br />
I would expect more than this poor excuse for creativity from such a large company and guess what you guys can too!<br />
Widening a collar on T6 mage set doesn't make it a T20 what a joke. <br />
To all those who like the sets, ofc they are awesome. Should be a small perk as part of some holiday not a major patch &quot;new&quot; set.<br />

we ask for updates of old sets so we can use the old sets we love without ripping out our eyes on dem horrid graphics<br />
we get them<br />
everyone loses their shit that blizzard would &quot;copy paste a set, so lazy, recycled, stupid, no one wanted them&quot;<br />
<br />
i fully agree, i think they all look good at the least :) also a lot of the sets are unfinished and people are assuming that what they see now is what it will be when the teir releases... like the paladin, it looks weird now because its unfinished; and the whole copy and paste thing is just a really dull, unoriginal comment that needs to stop... you dont have to like any of these but atleast give details onto why? maybe point out that the colors are not good or that a glove is too over complecated and cluttered with items... we gotta stop with the inmatture comments and actual critic every spec of each set... also all these sets have been recreated from scratch which even makes the &quot;copy and paste&quot; comment more obsolete (look at the old and new warrior set... yeah they are similar in design and but the new one has enough new things on it that make it different from the original)</div></div><hr />

Warriors are really good, Onslaught is improved in the right places, DK kinda fits the theme, paladins... something lacking, it really does simply look like the old T6, with nothing new.<br />
Druids and DHs.... Meh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
wow... you clearly did not read the big red text saying that these sets are a early preview (dont worry, sadly you are not the only one)... meaning that some of them are not finished yet :P the paladin set is one of the ones that is not completed and will probably look different when the patch gets closer to being released<br />
<br />

maybe because the paladin set is not finished... the big red words did say that these are early preview of the sets... meaning that some are not finished, such as the paladins.</div></div><hr />

I am also sad they chose to just basically reskin T6. I am VERY glad that this tier doesn't have an idiotic robe/kilt this time though!</div></div><hr />

its not that good, the fact that the set is the same as t6 nullifies it entirely for me</div></div><hr />
