PRAISE ALLAH! One minute buffs are the most horrid, crap idea ever. Glad they reverted this change.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sarius</div><div class="date">2009-10-08, 12:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To be honest, by the looks of some of the set bonuses, they're trying to encourage players to use all their cooldowns more often. Example with Tricks of the Trade, becomes very appealing to use as soon as it's off cooldown. Really useful for a DK to figure out the fastest way to unload all their runes all the time. A bunch of moves which you might not use as often now appear really appealing because of the benefit.<br />

I beg to differ as far as spamming Tricks of the Trade now vs. the 4pc. As it stands now you want to use it every time it comes off cooldown to maximize the amount of times it is used over the course of the fight, and the only thing stopping you from spamming it is to make sure you're not going to need that 15 energy for a finisher to sustain your rotation. With that 4pc you're going to have to make sure using TotT isn't going to cap you on energy which would result in DPS loss. Especially triggering the GCD.<br />
<br />
Nothing will really change as far as using it every time it comes off cooldown as you should be now. It's just a trade off of watching for starving your energy vs. capping it.</div></div><hr />

That Orc in the armor is DEFINITELY SAURFANG THE ELDER.<br />
<br />
1. Saurfang Jr. has brown skin. This orc has green.<br />
2. He has the same exact hair as Saurfang.<br />
<br />
Face it. Either our beloved Hero has new armor, or he's a boss.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thought as much....<br />
<br />
Hmm... Saurfang as a killable boss (on the airship battle)...<br />
<br />
With current raid difficulty, he'll be killed and looted by every PUG, on every server, every week from 3.3 release... Almost sad.<br />
<br />
Almost. Alliance here ;)</div></div><hr />

Probably about diminishing returns making it not that amazing compared to other tank set bonuses. Especially with most end game prot paladins not really needing much more avoidance.</div></div><hr />

Holy Paladin's bonus are amazing. The best on Wotlk, imo. They encorage cooldown usage, and they scale. (more divine favor -&gt; more holy shocks crits -&gt; more fast holy lights)<br />
<br />
<br />
Agree! That means every 6 seconds (5 if you have the Holy Shock Glyph), you will have a Holy Light that's almost capped for the Global CD, dependant on Haste and raid buffs obviously. Not to mention, you can still make use of your infusion of light from the Holy Shock Critical and then use the Holy Light buff from the 4 set. It's awesome! &lt;3<br />
<br />
The two set could be better, but a reduced CD on Divine Favor is nothing to QQ about. Guarenteed 100% Crit on Holy Shock every minute = Instant cast FoL and an uber fast Holy Light.. Not to mention the mana regen from your criticals.</div></div><hr />

Hope its not too off-topic, but didnt see anything about it here on the website.<br />

So far avaiable:<br />
DK, Druid, Hunter and Warrior.<br />

OH wait we have one with 2 minutes cd, who reduces damage by 50% and.......wait we have one if we he get a shot, who is suppose to kill us, dont kill.. And now let me think, and if i dont get that shot on a fight? its a cd i cant use. <br />
<br />
Now with 4P bonus palas gets... When you activate Divine Plea, you gain 12% dodge for 10 sec. (In pala tank, we are with divine plea always up.... Is 12%dodge always? doubt :\)<br />
<br />
Ok lets see DK's: When you activate Blood Tap, you gain 12% damage reduction from all attacks for 10 sec.<br />
<br />
And warriors:<br />
<br />
Your Bloodrage ability no longer costs health to use, and now causes you to absorb damage equal to 20% of your maximum health. Lasts until cancelled.<br />
<br />
Its a joke right?<br />
<br />
... Give us real cd's plz... Playing with just 1 cd with 2 minutes cd is nothing</div></div><hr />

This.<br />
<br />
These bonuses are awesome! Not only do they provide a fresh new breeze to the very healing cycles of a Holydin, they're also the perfect compromise to the Infusion of Light nerf we received earlier in WotLK. With twice the amounts of guaranteed crits (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=20216), each HS crit will boost your HL by a whopping 0.3 second casting time cut in addition to 20% extra crit chance.</div></div><hr />

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the whole idea about the rogue set (especially the, um &quot;mask&quot;) is that it should assume a sort of Geist-theme. Geists are very agile, sneaky and stabby. ;D</div></div><hr />

No, see, you ignorant pieces of shit obviously complain just to make yourselves look cool, but let me tell you......does this stop from people progressing? No, so obviously people don't feel that the items look like complete shit. Blizzard does their best to impress you people, but you obviously show no sign of appreciation. They could be like &quot;fuck giving you new items&quot;. Is that what you people want?<br />
<br />
Really, I will tell you this, if you had the chance to make an item set and show to people, you're bound to be upsetting at least a small percentage of the player base. The forums =/= the whole WoW community.<br />
<br />
And yes, I do see the set being stealthy and sneaky, also being terrifying when you see the noose, but on a human model it doesn't look as good (human model is fail). The only other time I felt that the rogues were done justice was Bloodfang. That's it. Anything else is fucking ridiculous.<br />

From a rogue's perspective, I would be happy. Last time I checked, people complained about tier 8, but there's a lot of people with the gear. People complained about tier 9, but there's a lot of people with the gear. How will tier 10 be any different.<br />
<br />
The tier whining has been going on since Vanilla WoW, and maybe just once, there will be a tier that will be released before live that will actually get the correct kind of feedback.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I don't really care that much for Hunters and Death Knights. I look at theirs in perspective, and couldn't see me in it at all (until we are viewed finished products on different races). The warrior is nice, I could see most the players being upset it's another animal based one, and the druid set is out of this world (though I look at the shoulders and think of Little Shop of Horrors, though that's not a bad thing).<br />

First boss is a black human warlock who doesn't look like any real like guy at all...no really...<br />
<br />
He casts shadow bolt, fear, a drain soul that spawns a weak add and and aoe that needs you to stand in the middle of the room.<br />

Second boss is RoS v2<br />
<br />
It casts a damage bolt type of spell, does a damage link with a random party member, summons adds that seamed to be untankable and randomly blew up and a lurker below/mimiron beam. All quite fun<br />

Wow..someone needs some anger management classes. Are you trying to intimidate and belittle us into seeing your point? Also, I dont like the set because (wait for it) I DONT LIKE THE WAY IT LOOKS, not because &quot;its cool&quot;.<br />
<br />
You are obviously taking this matter of (again, wait for it) honest opinion a bit too far. Step outside, and have a cig.<br />
<br />
And I'll give you the fact that the human models are a bad example. I play an undead female, so I know it will be slightly better looking. I dont know, maybe if the color scheme was different...</div></div><hr />

The 4pc makes it so you dont need the glyph, and turns it into a combination rage gen/defensive cooldown.</div></div><hr />

First boss is a black human warlock who doesn't look like any real like guy at all...no really...<br />
<br />
He casts shadow bolt, fear, a drain soul that spawns a weak add and and aoe that needs you to stand in the middle of the room.<br />

What about dreadnaught armor and the rest of the gear this expansion that gave you glowy blue eyes? Anyways, Saurfang the younger has brown skin. This orc has green skin and Varok's hair. *cough*. And the dwarf could certainly be Muradin, he's just wearing a funky blue eye helmet.</div></div><hr />

The 4pc makes it so you dont need the glyph, and turns it into a combination rage gen/defensive cooldown.<br />

As arcane you can blow away all your cooldowns with images up and gain a very big benefit. For fire and FFB it isn't generally quite as good due to the lack of cooldowns, but has its situational uses (Hodir, XT's heart, Jaraxxus etc. being examples of situations where you might want to pop them). It's basically a small on use trinket with a long cooldown. Not as good as t9 2-piece and definitely not as good as t9 4-piece.<br />
<br />
Mage 4-piece is quite an interesting one for especially arcane. Looking forward to seeing the maths about when to use MB procs with the bonus.<br />
<br />
I am guessing the buff will appear as you start your missile barrage cast. This means in a normal rotation you'd after the missiles get one AB in with 12% haste, unless you have haste buffs going on, making it two. I wonder if while not under the effect of increased haste it will end up being higher damage to after MB cast ABar and then AB, giving the ABar gcd the haste benefit as well as for the AB following that. Assuming you have enough haste to cut one second out of four which you should in t10.<br />
<br />
In the end these bonuses don't seem nearly as strong as the t9 bonuses do, but I need to have a second look after I wake up and am not quite as dizzy.</div></div><hr />

As a rogue, I'm loving the new tier gear for the rogue. It's different for sure but that's why I love it. It captures that geist feeling....hence sneaky and stealthy. A lot better than the horde t9 for rogues...that was major LolZ...lightbulbs for shoulders hehe poor horde. <br />
<br />
I also love the Druid set...it's got the feeling of druid with the helm and the colors but at the same time, this is a dark turning point in the game. This isn't happy go lucky....run on the plains of Nagrand and smile at the pretty clefthoof grazing. This is serious $hit. We're taking down Arthas, THE Lich King....the ultimate baddie in the game (at this point.) The tier gear is supposed to reflect the atmosphere of the game or the raiding area which the tier is available. This armor does it. Hell, all the armor looks FANTASTIC.<br />
The only set I'm having a problem with is the stupid hunters. I'm sorry...are you supposed to be spiky and $hit? The warrior is just .... amazing. I really love it. The helm really does it for me on this set. One thing that would be cooler for the Warrior set is if the haze on the shoulders was white...like frost. Seems outta place to have that orange/gold color on there. The DK set is good. Not great but not terribad....Interesting color combo tho. <br />
<br />
But seriously, this isn't gonna be a pansy ass raid. This is gonna be some hard $hit and dark $hit to. The tier gear (except hunter) so far looks really good and gives off that tone. Even the rogue. <br />
<br />
O, the prince NPC or w/ev models are amazing...as is Jaina. <br />

Fist of all, prot bonuses are sweet. That's why they'll change it. Bloodrage, come on, when Blizz gave warriors something that not only reduces health cost (well, Glyph of Bloodrage) but also causes warrior to heal 8+k every minute?<br />
<br />
And then I've looked on dps... both CHANCE set bonuses... though I can understand 20% I seriously doubt 2% will be of any use... no other class has both bonuses set at percentage. Look at enh shammy - that's cool, not &quot;You have 1% chance on getting response from in-game support in first 2 days.&quot;</div></div><hr />

(Side note: Everything's red/green and then we get a blue aura around the shoulders and probably the helmet, at the very least make it consistent)<br />
It doesn't look like the LK's armor at all (I didn't expect it to do but the colors make the whole set just meh).<br />
Also I find it hard to imagine that 4T10 grants more dmg than 4T9 after using it for a while with Unholy even if the 4T10-Bonus will probably have a 100% uptime after the first (half) rotation.<br />
So basically you'll get it just for its stats.<br />

By 'looks' you mean the set bonus?<br />

not so happy about lock set bonuses. kinda iffy. i dont want to be recasting ua and haunt every single time the 4 piece procs. i already have to gib dps by recasting haunt and ua every time when on-cast trinkets and effects pop so the dots can get their bonus. i like my 10% corr damage and 10% ua damage. i highly doubt there is going to be so much more sp on the tier 10 that it will make up for the 10% damage increases.</div></div><hr />

I hope your mum gets fired from life for giving birth to you! Just because I don't like you. \o/ I can do it too! If it's up to guys like you they would've fired the designers after every single tier. :D (QQ &gt; 1 is always true; where QQ is the amount of QQ about the look of ANYTHING)</div></div><hr />

Pro tips for non HoT based healers:<br />
<br />
1. Stop QQing. (Your mascara is running)<br />
2. Learn to read a DBM timer.<br />
3. Cast a heal at the appropriate time.<br />
4. Profit.</div></div><hr />
