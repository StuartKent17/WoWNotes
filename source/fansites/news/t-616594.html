Warrior - Upcoming Protection changes<br />
NOTE: These changes were in the works before the recent round of dps discussions. I hope to have some Arms and Fury changes to report soon.<br />
<br />
Armored to the Teeth -- Changed to AP, but amount reduced to 1 per 360 armor (to compensate for the loss of Blessings of Kings etc.). We implemented this talent for dps warriors and didn't want it to feel like the ultimate Shield Block Value talent. It's still good for Protection, just not as good. Death Knights will get the same treatment.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I meant 2 AP : 360 per talent point. My point was that we understand 1 Str &gt; 2 AP for warriors.<br />
<br />
Thunder Clap -- Increase in threat generation. No target limit. Swipe gets the same treatment. With these changes, all 4 tank classes should be able to generate very respectable AE threat. Consecration is still a little higher in threat to account for Thunder Clap's debuff.<br />
<br />
Revenge -- Added to Sword and Board as a chance to proc Shield Slam. Increased its damage significantly. We want Revenge to be the button you push first.<br />
<br />
Shield Slam -- Increased its flat damage to compensate for the Devastate nerf a few weeks ago. The Revenge change will help dps too, though only when you're tanking. We didn't want to increase the scaling portion of Shield Slam for fear that warrior threat becomes too high at ultimate gear levels, but we might still change it if they fall behind. We're not saying (for now) that Prot must do dps with a shield instead of dual-wielding Devastates, but this should make it more viable.<br />
<br />
We're doing some more mitigation and survivability tests now. Our suspicion is that warriors are fine in this department and paladins might fall behind in the area of Shield Block Value at very high gear levels. But we'll see. <br />

Death &amp; Decay Threat<br />
We can't find any situations where Blood Plague makes Death and Decay cause more damage. Ebon Plague will of course, because it's just a spell damage boost.<br />
<br />
We did several threat per second tests and decided to increase Death and Decay's threat in order to make DK's more effective AE tanks. You still aren't going to be able to spam it, but an initial D&amp;D should get enough threat against the targets that you'll have time to Pestilence, Blood Boil or whatever else before losing targets.

Frost Strike vs magic abilities<br />
By the numbers, Frost Strike should be beating Death Coil. Maybe you can test Frost's Death Coils vs. Frost Strike, which would help answer the question of whether it's Unholy's multipliers on Death Coil or just the base damage of Frost Strike that is causing the difference.<br />
<br />
Not so long ago, death knight spells could only crit for 150%. Now that that is no longer the case, some of the melee abilities may be too soft. But at least Death Coil is decent again. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/10544536850-frost-strike-why-cant-it-do-good-damage.html))<br />

Shadow Priests<br />
Assuming you are a Shadow priest, the answer is you are a dps class. We['re trying to back off the whole utility class thing, which is absolutely what you were in BC. While the mana battery functionality is still something every group is going to want, there are more ways to provide it now. The tradeoff for losing that unique niche is your dps going up. <br />
<br />
Why are shadow priests being out performed by other classes who, in terms of functionality at this point in time, fit into the same niche as shadow priests do? <br />
Because we're not done. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/6/10529925336-crunch-time-3x-is-comming-soon.html))<br />
<br />
Prayer of Mending changes and threat issues<br />
We've really buffed threat generation for tanks. Even when broken classes were doing 4500 dps in raids, they weren't pulling off the tanks. We're trying to back off threat management as a major component of grouping (though we're not removing it). Raid fights should be more about keeping people alive, knowing the fight, and coordinating with your group. As part of this philosophy, we are trying to make more consistent spells with odd threat rules, and PoM fell into that category.<br />
<br />
When threat numbers are very low, then things like PoM going off or even a Renew tick can cause threat problems. We think this is a little sucky and are trying to come up with elegant ways to fix it. While the start of a fight can present this problem, I actually think it's worse once a fight is well undeway and there are adds and spawns of some kind that go right to the healer.<br />
<br />
Another reason we changed the way spells like PoM healed was so the healing credit would actually go to the Priest in mods that track such things. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/6/10529924717-prayer-of-mending-threat.html))<br />

Potential rogue buffs / Dev Q&amp;A<br />
In terms of the big raid buffs, the ones we consider rogues bringing are Expose Armor, Wound Poison and Mind Numbing Poison. There are plenty of others more along the lines of Kick and Sap that are harder to quantify. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/7/10544535958-dear-gckoraa-vital-questions-about-rogues.html))<br />
<br />
With that in mind can you tell us any plans that you have to better close this PvE to PvP gap that we're seeing with certain trees? How do you plan to make all three trees viable across the board? <br />
Yes, this is definitely a priority. It is a lot harder with classes in which all specs are still focused mostly on dps. We understand that some specs are just going to be better for 5-mans, for PvP or for raiding. We're trying to equalize as much as possible, but we're also trying to be realistic about our chances. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/7/10544535958-dear-gckoraa-vital-questions-about-rogues.html))<br />
<br />
How do you plan to deal with talents which ware still considered all too needed by rogues, particularly in the case of Relentless Strikes? Is there any possibility of making Relentless Strikes a core class ability we can all train? <br />
Mandatory talents are tricky. There are certainly plenty of them in every tree. Every warrior spec without Cruelty is pretty experimental, as is every druid spec without Omen of Clarity. Part of the problem is we keep offering new character levels along with new talents, so each expansion ends up constraining you more and more to one tree. The real red flag, for me at least, is when a spec has so many truly mandatory talents (which is a funny thing to say, since it's still a little subjective) that they don't have any optional talents. Instead of a cookie-cutter build being something like 20 plus your choice, they become you must get these 24 talents. If that makes sense. <br />
<br />
It is IMPOSSIBLE to create anything but carbon copies of abilities in each of the 3 trees and not have SOME variance. If you want the highest DPS there will ALWAYS be a max DPS...even if by 1 or 2% one spec will ALWAYS be better. <br />
I think it is very likely there will be a theoretical max dps build. However:<br />
It will probably vary from boss to boss.<br />
It might depend a lot on the skill of the player.<br />
Because there are so many variables (by design) it may be really hard to &quot;solve the equation&quot; for which actually is the highest dps build.<br />
For 90% of players (maybe more) that kind of damage difference is in the noise. Very few players can do 2500 dps one night and then 2525 dps another night (a 1% difference). Usually the delta is much larger than that because of random elements including things as non-gamey as Internet lag, how tired you are and just bad luck. If taking the most optimal build can't gaurantee you dps higher than the random element in the equation, it may very well not be worth taking. Now if the dps gain is significant by taking the best build, then I agree with you. <br />
<br />
Talent tree balancing<br />
Rogue talents are hard because the class is ultimately very mathy. Without a finite resource like mana, it's easy to analyze every possible move for its cost efficiency and ultimate damage delivery. This is coupled with the fact that it's really easy for a rogue to move among trees. By contrast, before the advent of Frostfire Bolt a fire mage could mostly ignore frost. A shadow priest wants almost nothing in Holy. But having an emphais on poisons or stealth in a rogue tree doesn't make a tree unattractive to a Combat rogue. I'm not trying to make excuses, but perhaps more than any other class, I find that rogues can evaluate a talent's utility pretty easily. It's a cool thing about the class, but it makes talent design challenging.<br />
<br />
I think I mentioned this in another thread, but our team has a really amazing rogue theorycrafter who stays really in touch with the community (anonymously). We have a surprising number of really good players on the team in general, but I always feel really safe about his conclusions on rogues. But that has also meant fewer blue posts than you deserve, so I'm trying to make up for that. <br />
<br />
[...] I started a bit of a tempest in the warrior forms when I suggested Protection might get new talents that would let it be more PvP viable. But you know, they actually have some things they can do now.... Hopefully we can get 3 rogue trees there too.

Enhancement Shamans in WotLK<br />
We view Enhancement as a melee class that should be wearing melee gear. However, one of the interesting things about the shaman is throwing out some spells with that melee too. <br />
<br />
Our view of things is that some smart theorycrafters started wondering if using two fast caster weapons with two flametongue enchants would end up being the right way to go. The way the discussion sort of ended up was &quot;maybe, but it might be close&quot; but a lot of the community took that as a mandate. Or maybe they were just shocked by the supposition because it felt wrong for a melee class. We agree it feels wrong, so we're doing some tweaks to make it even less likely to be the most optimal set up. If you are saving up badges or arena points or whatever for your enhancement shammy, I would definitely NOT go out and get two fast caster weapons.

<br />
<br />

<br />
What they fail to notice, is that these abilities are also available to other classes.<br />
But unlike for those classes, using these abilities costs a hefty chunk of dps for the rogue to provide these for the group.<br />
It's also very difficult to change the use of these abilities. While the poisons are good in their own right, a warlock could switch from 1 curse to another and then forget about it for the next minute with only a marginal loss of dps. A rogue would have to step away from the fight and apply a new poison, while also losing all dps his offhand's or even mainhand's weapon temp buff might produce.<br />
<br />
Not to mention losing a 5 pt rupture over an expose armor equivalent which warriors will apply using devastate ANYWAY.<br />
<br />

<br />
They want to make it more available, as it's considered a mandatory talent.<br />
So, instead of keeping it where it is, in a spot where every rogue will gladly take it anyway.... they move it to subtlety, and change it from a 1 pt talent to a 5 pt talent, and thereby screw over every single raiding rogue.<br />
<br />
Makes sense.... not..<br />

druids, paladins and deathknights however dont have sunder armor.

Weird, I thought the extra strength was to balance out the fact that a prot paladin gets 15% extra strength from talents but a prot warrior can only get an extra 6% strength leaving prot warriors at a permanant 9% of strength disadvantage and without the associated block increase. This is portrayed as if it was moving warriors ahead on block value whereas in fact all it was doing is bringing them level, take the change away and warrior block will go back to being substantially lower than paladin block.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
for a prot warrior its not just a nerf regarding SBV<br />
<br />
its even a nerf regarding AP!<br />
<br />
6/360 &lt; 3/400 * 2 * 1.1 * 1.06<br />
<br />
I dont unterstand the nerf!<br />
<br />
honestly... shieldslam was supposed to be buffed compensating for the devastate nerf!<br />
now shieldslam gets a flat dmg increase and at the same time they nerf attt??? why's that?<br />
the outcome is plus minus 0 and the only compensation for the really radical devastate nerf is revenge?<br />
sry that doesnt outweight the loss...<br />
it would have been ok when they left attt the way it was.<br />
<br />
second thing is. they nerfed TC (meaning 100%=&gt;30%) and thus nerfing AE tanking (apart from the old 4target only change) therefore the increased shieldblock value due to attt was a nice to have and minimaly compensating this TC nerf in AE tanking situations due to dmg shield scaling! (~20more dmg per hit)<br />
<br />
third thing is: every single warrior tree has one sort of dmg reduction talent as Tier1. let it be deflection combined with a tps increase due to parry mechanic or anticipation (well not tier1 but i think you know what i mean) so attt's (in the fury tree) scaling BV for mitigation would just have been conclusive! (~100more SBV which in terms of mitigation is mediocre of cause scaling with critical block and shield block to ~400dmg but as blizzard already mentioned shield block is supposed to be a minor shield wall)<br />
<br />
i really hope and if &quot;ghostcrawler&quot; reads this they change their mind...<br />

honestly... shieldslam was supposed to be buffed compensating for the devastate nerf!<br />
now shieldslam gets a flat dmg increase and at the same time they nerf attt??? why's that?<br />
the outcome is plus minus 0 and the only compensation for the really radical devastate nerf is revenge?<br />
sry that doesnt outweight the loss...<br />
it would have been ok when they left attt the way it was.<br />
<br />
second thing is. they nerfed TC (meaning 100%=&gt;30%) and thus nerfing AE tanking (apart from the old 4target only change) therefore the increased shieldblock value due to attt was a nice to have and minimaly compensating this TC nerf in AE tanking situations due to dmg shield scaling!<br />
<br />
third thing is: every single warrior tree has one sort of dmg reduction talent as Tier1. let it be deflection combined with a tps increase due to parry mechanic or anticipation (well not tier1 but i think you know what i mean) so attt in the fury tree scaling BV for mitigation would just have been conclusive!<br />
<br />
i really hope and if &quot;ghostcrawler&quot; reads this they change their mind...<br />
<br />
<br />
The AP was a typo, it is 2 AP per 360 armor per point instead of 1 str per 400 armor per point. It is a nice buff for PvP since that is AP you wouldnt get otherwise, a tiny buff for PvE since you get 2 AP per 360 instead of 2.2 ap per 400 = 2 AP per 363.63 armor (a 1% increase in AP gained :) ).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
omg, the protection warrior has some new unbelievable buffs. kalgan must be back from his vacation.<br />
<br />
-damage shield is a 3xretribution aura. does some 200 free dmg<br />
-cleave no target limit. does up 1000dmg <br />
-thunter clap no target limit. 300-350 dmg<br />
-shockwave no target limit. 1000-1500 dmg.<br />
<br />
Don't this fools realize that an arms/fury warr can outdps aoe classes using cleave with a 2hd weapon?<br />
Or that pro warriors have more aoe threat than any other class? Death and Decay 52dps, consecration ~200dps<br />
cleave 1000dps.<br />
<br />
if they leave it like this they killed wow. if you had a druid or pala tank you are done for. DK tank...better go dps...<br />
<br />
<br />
1. But less than Retribution aura + holy shield.<br />
2. Cleave still only hits two targets, I don't know where you halucinated that change from.<br />
3 + 4. ~60 dps for thunder clap, ~40 dps for shockwave. The total is half that of consecration alone.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
They maybe factor in the critical block talent ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, but with the changes as they stand, paladins will basically have an extra 35% chance to block due to holy shield. In order for a warrior to gain benefit from critical block they would need to get another 35% block chance from somewhere. If the paladin tier pieces are correctly itemised so as not to stack block rating then the paladin should end up with higher stats than the warrior whose gear probably will need to stack block rating. Of course it could also be factoring in shield block which is a pretty fantastic short term mitigation ability right now.</div></div><hr />

i was considering the prot warrior since due to vitality he scales with strength as the following<br />
<br />
Strength * 1.1 * 1.06<br />
<br />
so as mentioned: 6/360 &lt; 3/400 * 2 * 1.1 * 1.06<br />
<br />
even for arms: 6/360 &lt; 3/400 * 2 * 1.1 * 1.04<br />
<br />
just for fury warriors its a minor but negligible buff</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just wanted to point out that Paladin tanks will (read:should) no longer use Retribution aura in raid situations since the +healing aspect of Devotion aura was added. Not trying to prove your point wrong, because you're certainly right, but the combination of Ret aura and Holy shield will be situational to protection farming, mostly. Additionally, Damage Shield is an 'always on' sort of thing relinquishing your rage to be used for something else, and on no cooldown, which we cannot say for Holy Shield.</div></div><hr />

@Skulver: HS give 30% block, and warriors have a 5% passive block talent, the difference should be like 25%, not 35%.</div></div><hr />

Hammer of the Righteous, not shield :).<br />
It hits for 3 times weapon DPS(including bonuses) to 3 targets. Swipe deals nearly as much I think (since droods got tons of ap) and to all targets in front of them. Even if swipe deals a half of it, there is still a big difference between a basic skill and a 51 point talent with target limit AND cd.</div></div><hr />

You do actually remember that Pallies have consecration (base skill) wich does a hell of a aoe threat (no target limit and keep going for some seconds while you're using other skills, and much more damage in 3.0) and all their damage/threat is holy damage, wich won't get any kind of mitigation like &quot;Droods&quot; and Warriors get, right?<br />
<br />
Right now, everything they do to DK, Druids and Warriors to improve their threat is to bring them closer to Prot Pallies in beta.</div></div><hr />

Instead of wasteing time on doing this stupid maths, they should focus on bringing more gear in the game, and give people more options. This way every tank will have option to put more stam, or more mitigation, or more avoidance, or more dps, or more resistance. Boss fights will be more interesting for tanks, everyone can find his own style for every boss.<br />
Blizz team who take care of abilities and trees is doing a great job, keep it this way! The team who take care of gear, is lame. (if is only one team they should focus more on gear, haha)</div></div><hr />

Other abilities are on a fix cd, if u are a good tank that cds are getting in your blood so you should not have to look at bar to know when to hit them.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's easy to get scrolling combat text that will pop up in your face every time it activates.<br />
<br />
If you miss something like this in the middle of your screen:<br />
dodge<br />
OMGUSEREVENGENOW<br />
<br />
Then you need to reroll.<br />
<br />
Also, get a decent bar mod that will grey out your buttons that you can't use at that moment/that stance, whatever. Then in your peripheral vision it's easy to see one particular button go from grey to lit up.</div></div><hr />

2. warrior mitigation is still hell HUGE<br />
3. they gave warriors full AOE tanking...<br />
<br />
anything else blizz ? thx<br />
<br />
<br />
1 - end pally mitigation is still a bit in question, blizz admits that.<br />
2 - warriors need the mitigation, even more now they will be holding more targets.<br />
3 - they dont have full aoe tanking. They have a burst aoe effect, every six seconds. Consecrate is still better, you cast it once, and it keeps working for eight seconds...it gets bonus from AP and Spell damage.  While we still cant compare the end game thunder clap (which does scale some with ap) with consecration, warriors needed this.<br />
<br />
As pallies we had our heyday, and it was a time of glory...heck, one of my favorite quotes ever came from another pallie tank I know.<br />
<br />
DPS: &quot;Whats the kill order?&quot;<br />
Pally tank: &quot;This room, the next, then the hall, then the boss&quot;...<br />
<br />
Don't be bitter that our warrior cousins and furry friends get a bit of the fun now too. <br />
<br />
Any players who play smart, learn their classes, and are not ass-hats/loot-whores in raids will have a place. That is the intent of blizz's changes, and I welcome them.<br />
<br />
I have tanked pally, druid and warrior. Try it, it gives perspective.</div></div><hr />

The next time I hear a warrior a druid complain about not bein' able to get threat OMFG, I'm gonna /facebash their .....face.<br />
<br />
/r<br />
Dal<br />
<br />
Yes, grats to them.<br />
<br />
However, DPS will ALWAYS be able to do more threat if they dont pay attention, that is part of the game. I rarely pull aggro in raids with my dps classes (except my shadow priest....dang....), of course, it does not hurt that I also tank..so you get a feel on the particular threat build rate will be on different encounters.</div></div><hr />

Haha, no problem. Did you get &quot;Scrolling Combat Text&quot;? I've used SCT for years now, it's a great combat text mod.</div></div><hr />
