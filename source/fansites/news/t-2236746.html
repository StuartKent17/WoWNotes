ToS opening. <br />

<br />
Cant we start upgrading legendaries tomorrow? Do we also have to wait until ToS opens? <br />

Character / Items<br />
Do you continue to gain stamina per point past 52 in concordance?<br />
Yes, your health increases at a reduced rate compared to prior points. However, tank + healer bonus damage doesn't increase after point 52. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/871796808627789825))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
could we get an explanation on why s3 pvp elite appearance is being released at the end of s4 <br />
The ensembles become available when those appearances can no longer be obtained in rated PvP. Legion Seasons 3&amp;4 share an armor appearance. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/870729017216741376))<br />
<br />
does anyone know if u account change a char if u have to do 150 wins all over again?<br />
No, transferring a character to another account does not reset the number of wins-- only a faction transfer resets the number of wins. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/872529155736219648))<br />
<br />
Could you guys take a look at southshore vs. Tarren Mill again? Particularly at the balance, for the alliance. Thanks.<br />
We learned a great deal from this first run of Southshore vs. Tarren Mill, and weâ€™ll make adjustments for next time. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/872560517918871552))<br />
<br />
is Concordance capped at 52(first pt) in rated pvp?<br />
There is no cap. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/872560757912633344))<br />
<br />
Can you verify that you need 150 wins on a toon to get Gladiator Legion Season 3 or just for R1?<br />
Both Gladiator and Cruel Gladiator require 150 wins. All other titles require 50 wins. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/872560886266736641))<br />

WIll saved up pvp tokens (Echoes) go away with the end of season? Or will they persist through season end?<br />
They are converted to gold at end of season. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/872668203024924674))<br />

Muff man! where is Varimithras the best dreadlord ever its not a secret is it?<br />

At 20,000 order resources for one stack of crafting mats (or even more for e.g. felslate, starlight rose), I can't see this disrupting things too horribly?</div></div><hr />

The only people I can see even utilizing this would be ones who have 50k+ stockpiled, which isn't that much of the player base.<br />
<br />
I also like how you can use 1 blood to get 200 Order Resources, yet buying 1 blood costs 1k resources.</div></div><hr />

At first I read this as you could buy 5000 OR for 5 bloods and got really excited. Then I just got disappointed.<br />

When we said we wanted a OR dump we didn't mean an actual dump.</div></div><hr />

3h36min * 40 = 6 days exactly, might have something to do with that (thought you don't actually do 40 researchers, so I'm lost)</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I figured echoes would've lasted through Season 4 since 3 and 4 share the same set. Logged in Tuesday and found out they wiped it.<br />
<br />

<br />
The tweet said this hotfix was for 27-40 which is under 2.1 days (math might be off). 1-25 don't have a cooldown at all. You give 500, you get your research them and level 26 is quested off Broken Shore. It's a mechanic for after that.<br />
<br />
2.1 days is also if you log in every 7 hrs 12 minutes. So it'll likely be a little bit under 3 days if you log in enough times during the day to match the cooldown.</div></div><hr />

Thank god for that, was a slaughter-fest there and sometimes damaging effects you cast in the scenario carried over when teleportet out, so the guards would slaughter you as well. -.-<br />

Nice reading skills. It's 1.000 per blood - you can switch every blood for 200 resources on alt, so it's perfectly fair.</div></div><hr />
