Increased NPC Damage in latest build<br />
There seems to be a problem where some (?) caster mobs do way too much damage. Your experience may have everything to do with the specific mobs you fight. Listing particular mobs that seem more deadly than you'd expect would be helpful. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435496812/cataclysm-mob-damage-changes/))<br />

[...] The idea isn't for you to be in Godmode, mowing through everything in your path. The idea is - in fact - for you to have to stop to rest, bandage, heal, every once in awhile.

We're currently investigating issues with creature spell damage scaling. The intent is definitely not for players to have to rest after every single solo pull. Melee damage, on the other hand, seems about right, but may undergo some fine tuning. Keep the feedback for specific lethal creatures and deadly points of interest coming.

Relics class requirements gone in Cataclysm<br />
You are looking at existing, Wrath of the Lich King, items. Those are currently only used by those classes, so there isn't a great motivation or need to change them.<br />
<br />
Cataclysm-level relics can be used by any paladin, shaman, druid or DK, though there may still be some class-specific ones from time to time. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435196258/relics-have-stats/))<br />
<br />
Relics changes in Cataclysm<br />
The &quot;on paper&quot; design of the Lich King relics sounds pretty cool: you have your choice of which of your spells or abilities you care about the most. Maybe a Resto druid takes the Rejuv idol over the Regrowth idol. In reality, what happens is that we make 3 druid idols per tier so the Resto druid is stuck with whatever idol we make. If we make the Rejuv idol, awesome. If we make the Lifebloom idol, probably less awesome (or at least much more situational). Of course we could just make the Rejuv idol every tier, but really that's not much different than the stats. The procs are designed to mostly be always up, so it's just clutter in the buff section of your UI.<br />
<br />
With the new model, there is less risk of having the &quot;bad luck&quot; of having a bad relic for an entire tier for your spec. In fact, it should even offer a little more choice because you could choose the crit relic over the haste relic. Currently you don't get a choice because we have to offer such specialized relics. The gem socket is to make them at least feel slightly different from the ranged items that can shoot.<br />
<br />
To be brutally honest, I wouldn't call our ranged weapon slot a success for any class. Warriors, rogues and all wand users don't care much about their ranged weapon slot except as a stat stick. Warriors and rogues use their ranged weapons once in awhile, but we really don't like the model where a caster wands everything while leveling instead of using their actual spells. The only class that really cares about the ranged slot is the hunter, and they in turn don't care much about their melee weapon. Furthermore, the hunter doesn't get the same kind of stat budget out of their primary weapon that the melee guys do. Believe me, we have had many meetings just to discuss the ranged slot. We don't have a solution yet that we think is better than the current Cataclysm implementation, but it's the kind of thing we're going to keep working on for a long time. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435196258/relics-have-stats/))<br />
<br />
Class &quot;roles&quot;<br />
We try not to divide classes / specs into such discrete buckets. Our overriding design is to try and have classes feel diverse, such that rerolling or adding a new class to your group feels interesting, but still give you the tools to fill your role. If any healer is too good at one thing, they tend to get stacked, and if a healer is too weak at anything, they risk being unwanted.<br />
<br />
Put another way, we used to have this design that say DKs were the magic tank and paladins were the AE tank. The thought was that if you had a paladin in your group you were happy when you had an AE fight but that you'd be fine with anyone else. In reality, this didn't play out so well. Players felt compelled to swap players in and out of their groups, or be reluctant to run a 5-player dungeon with the &quot;wrong&quot; tank. We decided that tanks need to be tanks.<br />
<br />
Likewise, our model for healers for a long time has been that everyone has their little niche. We now think healers should just be healers. We just have to make sure that they still feel different enough that you'd prefer to have as many different healers as you can. The big difference is that raids have more healers than tanks, so we have a little bit of room to make the healers more differentiated from each other than the tanks are. But only a little bit, and that space is going to be even smaller in Cataclysm than it was in LK.

Moonkin Form<br />
We've had a lot of discussions about Moonkin form, as you might guess. We know opinions range among the player base from &quot;cut it&quot; to &quot;make me stay in my adorable form all the time.&quot; At first we were trying to make it more of an option, so that cuddly-hating Balance druids could choose the spec without the shapeshift. After much discussion though, we're going to go back to a Balance druid = Moonkin Form design. We'll put some more damage into the Moonkin Form. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435285020/moonkin-form-pointless/))<br />
<br />
Restoration<br />
As far as the history goes here, we thought at the time (and still think!) that the Resto druid wasn't going to be well served as a &quot;I only care about hots and nothing else&quot; healer. It's just too extreme a design. Any time when hots are good (by which I mean both individual encounters and periods in the game as a whole) the druid is going to dominate. Any time when hots are terrible, so will be druids. We probably, in retrospect, didn't push Nourish enough, because we still ended up in a raid healing situation where druids used Rejuv and Wild Growth and were loathe to use any other button.<br />
<br />
We are going to push even harder in Cataclysm. Druids will still have exceptional hots, but will need to cast direct heals as well. I usually get a lot of responses after such a post from druids saying &quot;But I only want to cast hots!&quot; I'm not sure how to respond to that, because we just don't think it works. :(<br />
<br />
As far as the AE healing goes, it's definitely something to keep an eye on, but we're not worried about it yet. We are trying to cut back (yet again) on the dominance of the smart AE heals. The cooldowns of CoH and WG need to stay high. We do have some room to lower the mana cost on WG, and probably will.<br />
<br />
It's also worth mentioning that Efflorescence does some great AE healing, and is probably overpowered at the moment.<br />
<br />
One change we are going to make is reintroducing the talent that lowers Rejuv to a 1 sec GCD. Since haste affects Rejuv ticks and since druids will be casting cast-time spells that benefit from haste, we're not as worried about druids turning up their noses at haste. This will let you get Rejuvs up on more people when you want to, though it still should be mana-inefficient to just do so at random. We think hots are going to be enormous in the Cataclysm healing model just because they won't be overhealing nearly as much as they are now.<br />
<br />
We like the way Nourish interacts with hots. Yes, it's different from the way priests, paladins and shaman use their heals, but we do want the classes to play differently, as long as those differences aren't so extreme that you can't use a druid on some dungeon or raid fights.<br />
<br />
I suspect we won't end up keeping the snare on Tree of Life. We knew that we could try snare and then remove it. We would have a hard time trying no snare and then adding one. Our intent was to make you think about when was the best time to push ToL rather that just hitting it the second it's off cooldown. In practice though we just think it feels crappy so even if it accomplishes our goal, it's probably not worth it.<br />
<br />
We're still working on the Resto tree (and druids in general). You were missing the talent to lower the cast time of Nourish and Healing Touch, which is a pretty painful thing to live without. We're also considering changing Furor to provide intellect to caster form too so it is attractive to both caster trees. We agree that too much of the early Resto tree felt like it was there for Feral.<br />
<br />
I'm talking PvE in almost all of this, since that was the original thrust of the thread. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435494961/druid-restoration-beta-pve-update/))<br />
<br />
This seems really at odds with the increase in Rejuv's mana cost. We're not supposed to pre-HoT the raid, but you're adding in a talent designed to let us do exactly that? I'm very confused by this. <br />
We don't like prehotting (or pre-shielding) as a general strategy. On certain fights where you know that the damage is going to come fast and furious then maybe it's appropriate, but we don't want the current LK style to continue. I've healed a lot as both Resto and Disc, so I know the power of prehealing, though it's not as if you need first-hand experience to understand how useful and powerful it is.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if a lot of people take damage at once, we have no problem with getting a Rejuv out on several of them at once, and a lower GCD will help there. It's still possible to screw that up (by which I mean we want healing to have some player decision-making as part of the gameplay) by using too much mana on Rejuvs or casting too many Rejuvs when the situation called for something else. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435494961/druid-restoration-beta-pve-update/))<br />
<br />
I am still concerned about the proc-rate of Efflorescence, however, and hope it isn't underpowered at lower gear levels and then overpowered in higher gear levels.<br />
It's okay -- to a point -- if some talents are more useful at different gear levels than others. It's interesting if you consider changing talent specs rather than having one that serves you well in almost all stages of the game. But we don't want the extremes either, where it never procs as you're leveling and is up 100% of the time so that you fish for it in the endgame. Definitely something to keep an eye on. We also might take the wounded restriction off of Nature's Bounty, so that Regrowth just crits a lot. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435494961/druid-restoration-beta-pve-update/))<br />
<br />
I'm going to assume that the lowered GCD is to allow for situations where Players A, B, and C got him by a small AOE and were taken down to 70% health. Nourish is too slow to heal all three, Regrowth is too expensive for that little damage, and Wild Growth costs too much for just three targets. So instead you just toss a Rejuv on each of them and move on. This is much different than the current model where you would just keep as many players Rejuv'd as possible with WG on cooldown.<br />
Yes! (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435494961/druid-restoration-beta-pve-update/))<br />

New Call Pet<br />
Here is the way the new Call Pet works.<br />
<br />
At some higher level (25?) you get &quot;Call Pet 2.&quot; If you have a second pet (e.g. Festus), it will change the spell name to &quot;Call Festus&quot; instead. You can then call either pet 1 or 2, so long as you dismiss the other one first. Dismissing no longer affects happiness because we want you to be able to do it often.<br />
<br />
Eventually you will get Call Pet 3-5 as well. If you ever want more pets than you are able to call, you need to visit the stable and swap some into &quot;deep storage.&quot;<br />
<br />
We are discussing just giving you Call Pet 2-5 at the same level, to make this a little less confusing. Getting the ability to swap from a fourth to a fifth pet isn't nearly as exciting as getting the ability to call a second one.<br />
<br />
The Call Pet button is a flyout. You can put this button on your bar and expand it to pick a particular pet. In this way, you only sacrifice one button to calling all your pets. If you like having all your pets separately, then you can either drag the individual pets to your bar. You can even drag them from the Call Pet flyout.<br />
<br />
Warlocks work almost exactly the same way with regard to the flyout. Warlocks have no dismiss button, but instead summoning takes a cast instead of being instant like with the hunter. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435456716/bug-new-call-pet/))<br />

Hunters in Cataclysm<br />
We're still following this discussion. Some players are making some good points and we have addressed some of these in our most recent builds. Here is a quick update on some of the issues being discussed:<br />
<br />
Focus -- We think we're in a much better spot for focus regen now. Our goal has been for focus to be a resource you spend on your higher damage shots, which is regenerated passively at a rate lower than energy regen, but faster than energy if you are using Steady / Cobra (which can only be done while stationary). At the lower regen rates, we found it felt bad if you couldn't Steady / Cobra rather than Steady / Cobra feeling like a bonus. We think we're closer to the sweet spot now, but please let us know (preferably after you've actually tried it rather than prophesizing doom).<br />
<br />
Aspects -- We're not happy with the way the Hawk vs. Fox choice is playing out. We think that ultimately either damage or focus regen is going to win out and the other aspect won't get much use. For now, we are going back to Hawk being used for damage and regen. We'll discuss other potential uses for Fox. Changing Aspects will not affect focus regen.<br />
<br />
Mobile damage -- This is always a touchy subject. In our testing, we found that it wasn't fun with the current implementation when hunters had to move around a lot, especially in PvP. This is why we are giving up on the current Aspect of the Fox design. We also significantly reduced the focus cost per damage of Arcane Shot, so that it is usable under almost all circumstances. We've also removed the focus costs on several utility abilities (e.g. Concussive Shot, Intimidation, Bestial Wrath, Scatter Shot, etc.) One potential use for Aspect of the Fox is to generate additional focus when you take damage, but we don't want to get back into a world where you are &quot;aspect twisting&quot; when someone comes into melee with you in PvP.<br />
<br />
Survival -- We're still iterating a lot on this tree in particular. We agree it's probably the least polished of the hunter trees so far. The reason is that we just have it in for Survival hunters.<br />
<br />
Pets -- As I posted in another thread recently, a pet scaling pass is underway. We still plan to do passes on the hunter pet talents and abilities as well. With the design that allows you to swap pets often in the field, we want to make sure that there are some interesting choices in which pet you use for a given situation. Provided they are all crabs.<br />
<br />
In case I need to say it, the last two sentences of the last two paragraphs are not meant to be taken seriously. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24702152874/hunter/))<br />
<br />
Pet Scaling<br />
Pet scaling is getting a massive overhaul at the moment. For starters, we still intend for pets to scale with all of the master's stats for things like hit, haste and crit. For the big stats, our current plan is something like this:<br />
<br />
Ferocity (damage) -- 50% of master's AP, 40% health, 50% armor<br />
Tenacity (tanking) -- 35% of master's AP, 50% health, 70% armor<br />
Cunning (utility) -- 40% of master's AP, 40% health, 60% armor<br />
<br />
Warlock pets will be getting a similar pass. In general, we want pet dps to be 20-30% of player dps. Note that this is a lot lower than current BM and Demo lock numbers. Pet damage as BM will still be higher than Marks or Survival though, and we want BM to be competitive overall with Marks and Survival. (Ditto for locks.)

Mind Melt -- The timing of the Mind Melt buff interaction with Mind Spike sounds like a bug and will be fixed.<br />
<br />
Shadowy Apparition -- It sounds like there are a lot of bugs still with the implementation. The way we intend for it to work is that the Apparitions are shades of your character and will attack the correct target (the one with SW:Pain on it). We have already fixed several bugs relating to Shadowy Apparition interacting with Shadow Orbs and Mind Blast.

Pet Scaling (See Hunters)<br />
Warlock pets will be getting a similar pass. In general, we want pet dps to be 20-30% of player dps. Note that this is a lot lower than current BM and Demo lock numbers. Pet damage as BM will still be higher than Marks or Survival though, and we want BM to be competitive overall with Marks and Survival. (Ditto for locks.)

Inner Rage<br />
The numbers on Inner Rage are very easy to adjust. I wouldn't obsess over the current ones too much.<br />
<br />
We don't want warriors to sit around autoattacking until they proc Inner Rage all of the time. We also don't want them to be bummed when they slip into it. It's there so that if you get 100 rage and can't spend it fast enough that you aren't overly penalized. I realize some of you think that can't ever, ever happen with the new numbers, but we haven't seen enough high-end PvP or raiding to be convinced yet.<br />
<br />
The numbers just need to be such that you play normally until you get Inner Rage and continue to play normally if it happens. Changing your behavior to try and hit it ASAP or avoid it isn't what we're going for. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435296359/warrior-changes-12759/))<br />
<br />
Protection Warrior<br />
I'm not sure why you feel that the new Shield Spec is required. If you struggle with rage it might be nice, but there are other solutions to that too. We left it as 3 points because it's a nice talent for backfill potential. If you have 1 spare point, you get a little bit of benefit out of it (compared to say talents that have a 33/66/100% chance to work with 1/2/3 talent points).<br />
<br />
I would get Toughness and Shield Mastery, no question. You either need 2/3 Incite or 2/2 Hold the Line and then 2 more talent points to get deeper.<br />
<br />
In the deeper tiers, I would consider Last Stand, Bastion of Defense, Devastate, Sword and Board and Shockwave to be non-negotiable. Heavy Repercussions, Improved Revenge and Warbringer are very close to being non-negotiable. The others are up to debate or your individual style.

Nobody ask for &quot;less thinking tool&quot;, ret paladins survivability is as day and night on beta compared with Wotlk, im not child ask for some skill which will do their job instead of me, but removing magic dispel ability, by changing range classes &quot;slowing&quot; skills with big hole in mobility department as ret your chances on on open field fight as bg is very very low.<br />

So, &quot;the right way&quot; is to make you completely immune to being kited? How very Paladin, liking to be immune to things.<br />

Kiting will always happen. It's not cheap, it's how ranged is supposed to play. This will help you close the distance, but not 100% of the time. That would be overpowered.</div></div><hr />

Thought about it and yes it would be too much to ask BUT removing current snare effect would be more usefull, even if it would have lets say 30% chance atleast it would give as some chance except of hand of freedom, bare in mind rets dont have anymore ability to remove magic effect.<br />
Im not kid asking give me super uber imba skills on which i dont need to think, but as i play on beta it feels awful not have chance to outsmart enemy time to time whit own skills especially range classes.</div></div><hr />

Then we're finally in the same situation like other melee. We DO have a gap closer now and regained some of our defensive capabilities - mind you, we can use AW with DS now. We're given mini-sprint and semi-charge, considering we have more utility than those Rogue or Warriors. Blizzard also said they don't want to play burst such a big role - so I can only say, I will sleep without worrying for my Ret paladin PvP future. We all need to see how it comes with next beta builds and finally Cataclysm release.<br />
Just remember - Blizz giving us something like this acknowledged that we had problem with mobility. It's important for Ret community.</div></div><hr />

Where in the comment you quoted does it say this? It says ranged will kite. You now have a tool that will help you close the distance when they kite. They don't have a 100% chance to win against you and you don't have a 100% chance to win against them. That's called something. That's called fairness.<br />
<br />
Pallys SHOULDN'T have a guaranteed distance closer. My Shaman gets kited. My Rogue gets kited. My Warrior gets kited. Do I have tools to close the distance when the cooldowns are up? Yes, I do. Pallys will now, too. It's putting you on level with the other melee, not making you better at chasing ranged down than other melee. <br />
<br />
Asking for anything more will be more than any other melee gets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
~~ Holy ~~<br />
<br />
<br />
Removed Light of Dawn comment until I can clarify what exactly the change is. Is it simply altering it so that the cone does an extra 10/20/30% more healing depending on your Holy Power or is it a complete change in which it is no longer a heal, just a short duration buff to healing similar to Inquisition? If it's the latter, that's just retarded.<br />
Blessed Life revamp seems pretty nice, if there's a constant AE damage going like in something like the Twin Valkyrs on you'll have full Holy Power for nearly the entire fight through Holy Shock, healing your beacon target, and this talent. Although I have to wonder, since it says &quot;All damage&quot; does that mean you can get it by standing in fires sitting around major cities and such? Not truly important but it could come in handy if they put a damaging fire somewhere in an encounter.<br />
Divine Favor revamp is amazing. While it's no longer a guaranteed crit, the lasting duration more than makes up for it.<br />
Enlightened Judgements is what intrigues me, now it seems to be a primarily PvP-oriented ability. If what Ghostcrawler said is true and we are indeed getting hit from passives then it appears my points will shift from this to Blessed Life.<br />
<br />
<br />
~~ Protection ~~<br />
<br />
<br />
Divine Shield + Avenging Wrath sounds fun.<br />
Hand of Reckoning change seems reasonable. From the sounds of it, Avenger's Shield will be off cooldown by the time you're finished with the current pull, which means you no longer need to use HoR for pulling, which is the main reason why they added so much extra damage.<br />
Sacred Duty revamp is very nice, can't wait to start smacking people with my shield with the force of twenty men in Cataclysm.<br />
Vindication change was expected, since you wouldn't be using Holy Wrath nearly as much as Crusader Strike or Hammer of the Righteous.<br />
Did Holy Shield always get refreshed off Inquisition? I only recall Shield of the Righteous working for it.<br />
Hallowed Ground change was expected as they increased the mana cost of Consecration.<br />
Hammer of the Righteous change is... interesting. Currently it sounds rather weak if it factors in the &quot;Splits damage among all targets&quot; thing that accompanies other AE attacks. But the concept sounds cool.<br />
<br />
<br />
~~ Retribution ~~<br />
<br />
<br />
Inquiry of Faith sounds like the talent that will give Retribution 100% uptime on Inquisition.<br />
Divine Purpose makes it sound like Ret has a lot of opportunities to generate Holy Power.<br />
Sanctity of Battle sounds interesting. I have to wonder if, with enough haste, you could get to a 1 sec cooldown on Crusader Strike.<br />
Improved Judgements made me go &quot;Hmm...&quot;<br />
Eye for an Eye sounds like it's being tuned to work specifically on AE attacks, which means they're trying to make it more raid-oriented.<br />
Long Arm of the Law: &quot;Your Judgement has a 50/100% chance to increase your movement speed by 30% for 4 sec--&quot; YES! &quot;--when used on targets at or further than 15 yards from you.&quot; DAMN! It's a gap closer we've been looking for and they manage to muck it up. Oh well, it's only beta. At least they're willing to acknowledge that Paladins need a working gap closer. No more of that &quot;Judgement of Justice is your gap closer!&quot; bull.<br />
Eternal Glory just sounds like a PvP or Healing talent, I hope as Holy you can spare enough points to get it.</div></div><hr />

I interpreted it as the cone does 10/20/30% more healing depending on the amount of Holy Power you had. I doubt even Blizzard is stupid enough to change a cone heal to a healing increase.</div></div><hr />

Everything I've heard thus far about how classes are competing in PvP says that priests are currently bottom-rung. Of course there will be more passes. So we can't know.

What does this mean? That unless I am constantly tricks'ing the tank, After my initial tricks the mob/boss is gonna turn and splat me? Or is it a nudge in the direction of &quot;let the tank get aggro first, then tricks the other rogue&quot;?<br />
<br />
<br />
it means you still use it on the pull so the mobs/boss definitely goes to the tank, but the tank is still responsible to generate his own threat lead instead of just stacking MD/tricks the whole fight<br />
<br />
and you could use it like a reverse fade during a fight, when you're just about to pull agro, turning it situational instead of doing it on cooldown</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why it may sound good on paper it probably wont fly in reality. The classes arent identical and im pretty sure hunters, for example, are hit less by any downtime than other classes. Of course this applies to more classes being good at killing while not needing to &quot;rest&quot;. Its all about creating a balance and it has never really worked that well in WoW. Im guessing elemental shamans, shadow priests, moonkins and mages will be getting &quot;downtime&quot; while paladins, hunters, warlocks, death-knights probably wont. In the end it wouldnt surprise me if it'll look like on live servers.<br />
<br />
My point is, downtime is bad, especially in dungeons while leveling. The classes hit the most by this are of course dps mana users. The only class you'll ever wait for in a dungeon is a healer, you'll never wait for a dps getting his mana back. I dont play in the beta so i have no idea how it all works it all works there while leveling. I just hope they dont make the game &quot;boring&quot;, yeah, downtime *is* boring. I guess we'll see how it all turns out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We'll see, in the end i'm sure retribution unlike other dps classes will remain &quot;meh&quot;. I guess to much crying.. the problem occurs because if you're an Okay paladin you'll do the damage expected. Whereas if you know what you're doing you'll use all the paladin tricks and get the best out of it (those of us who have remained retribution since before 1.9 will be good at what we do). People cry foul.<br />
<br />
I dunno... more changes are needed with the paladin class, Blizz seemed to have a plan a month ago and it's all went to pot. See how the shitty.. i mean experimental rogue wannabe combo point holy power works out.<br />
<br />
although i doubt we'd go back to vanilla where 1 tree (holy) was useful, or tbc (you want to tank?, but you're a paladin.. go heal) or wrath (paladins are balanced, nerf them). But... we'll see how it goes ;)</div></div><hr />

Yeah like steady shot does soooo much more damage than auto shot... they just changed it to where you can use steady instead of auto on the run, big deal. And like focus regen when someones attacking you matters when they ARENT...<br />

<br />
Their reasoning for taking away Tree of Life is different from their reasoning for keeping Moonkin.<br />
<br />
If you recall some months ago they had a poll in which they asked people how they felt about ToL. As the months wore on we got a few hints here and there that they were examining the ability critically. What it came down to was that while it felt reasonable for a DPS class to give up healing most of the time it felt awkward for a Restoration Druid to give up a significant amount of Balance utility (and also nuking with the new scheme) to turn into a tree...just to be as good of a healer as other healers who got to keep their general class utility. <br />
<br />
This line of reasoning bears no relationship to their discussion on Moonkin form where they debated for a while on its merits and decided that they linked its strengths being linked to a form.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm betting that they're going to make glyphs significantly more expensive to make. <br />
<br />
Right now glyphs are cheap because Blizzard has some expectation that we swap repeatedly. It would be stupid if they were extremely expensive, especially since many of the glyphs are situational. But if Blizzard makes them permanent they'll probably increase their cost of production, and hence cost of purchase, significantly. Probably not to the level of a crafted item, but perhaps more in line with things like epic leg thread/armor.<br />

It will be a lot of glyphs in the start, but think about it they need like 5 glyphs pr specc so thats 15 total glyphs, while some glyph swap a lot and some dont, but since they are permanent peoples will probably buy all needed glyphs, instead of just buying the 3-6 glyphs they need.<br />

a paladin wont have much downtime tbh, and a shadow priest wont have it too hard just takes more &quot;skill&quot; dot up 5 mobs shield yourself and disperse until they are dead, no chance 5 mobs is going to do 240k damage in that time (unless they arent dead before dispersion, FEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
still paladins are being totally reworked so you cant say that you know he wont have much downtime because he doesnt now<br />

Wait wait 600% OF your max health over 20 seconds (taking into account you can get 200 rage in that time) Wow. Did I miss a 0.3% ? or is Blizzard just trying to buff it insanely?

Thats what i was thinking too. Also i dont play Beta i do like a challange when doing quest and grind a mob or two. It makes the people think twice about mob pulls..just like it was in Vanilla when you had to watch out for patrols. The battle of hillsbrad questline comes to my mind here. If they playerbase doesnt learn cc / pulling by questing they will have to learn in the hard way in the 5-mans.<br />

I'm also wondering why blizzard are keeping both Blade Barrier and Bladed Armor in for death knights, when they took out the +Parry talent and Armored to the Teethed for warriors. Are Blade Barrier and Bladed Armor not comparable to those in the boring sense?<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm jumping ahead here on the QQ train, but with such a void in DK information lately, I have a sad feeling that they are stamping the DKs the seal of finalization, even though there are still concerns about the trees. :(<br />

PS: About all the &quot;hotsteak not procing pyroblast&quot; stuff, I think it's talking about how the talent currently says that pyroblast can proc the hot streak affect, so you would have the old instant pyroblast chaining pewpew.</div></div><hr />

While I am glad they are working on classes it makes me feel that end of beta is really, really far. Its not just about zones/dungeons/raids but they are seriously changing most classes really often. Not good.<br />
<br />
Few things:<br />
<br />
Druid tanks - seems that they now have Shield Wall (60% reduction) and Last Stand + Enraged Regen in one spell which makes them similiar to other tanks and they also have Barkskin in addition to that. So druids are now what, kings of tanking CDs? Very fair for the biggest hybrid ingame...<br />
<br />
Paladins - So judgements have like 8s CD and the new sprint has 4sec duration, thats just great. Way to make probably the most OP gap closer due to very low CD... Im not saying paladins should look at say mages as something they have no chance to beat but this? Plus their &quot;bursty damage&quot; stays if im not mistaken so they just sprint to you once or twice, rape you in those few GCDs and GG... <br />
Common do we really need 80% of people who arent in some serious guild where they have to fill raid spot to play Paladins again? The number is made up but it sure as hell felt that way back in 3.0 and further. Plus there will be no DKs this time.<br />
<br />
Shamans - too low representation and too many totems to use already. Cons aura should have gone to lets say holy/disc priests. Also it seems like Air totem to me, will see.<br />
Also... This:<br />
Elemental<br />
Lava Burst (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/77451/) damage has been increased by 25%.Seriously? You are increasing hp etc but you still want to keep the 1shot (at least of non-resil targets) aspect in the game, heh? Way to lower burst, Blizz...</div></div><hr />

<br />
UH DK's rotation seems like IT, PS, SS, FS, Dump. Then all you hit is SS and FS, Since FS increases disease duration. It's quite possible that FS is broken on Beta atm, as you never have to recast IT/PS once disease are up. You also never cast BS, ever. This change might be good for pvp, or for grinding, but not for raiding.</div></div><hr />

I don't. Lets be honest. We were in god mode a long time ago (even when creatures were still doing more damage). If they don't want us to be in god mode then they should add in some elite mobs that we have to actually work to kill. I'm against anything that requires a group outside of instances from 1-84. However, some elites that are doable solo (maybe duo) if you actually work for it would do a better job of ending the god mode and mix the fights up enough to add some actual variance.<br />

Would you like to desgin them for them? Seriously, they have only hit the mark around 2-3 times since TBC. Before TBC there were quite a few of them, and that allowed for more diversification. If they didn't go with the stat stick idea, they would have needed to add more for each spec per tier.<br />

What does this mean? That unless I am constantly tricks'ing the tank, After my initial tricks the mob/boss is gonna turn and splat me? Or is it a nudge in the direction of &quot;let the tank get aggro first, then tricks the other rogue&quot;?<br />

Well, if you are snared, frozen, stunned or sheeped, you can use your PvP trinket immediately, judge the offender and chase them down. Don't just expect Blizzard to hand you tools and not make you work at something... oh wait...<br />
<br />
You do realize Blizzard has already said they are removing the &quot;PvP Trinket&quot; from the game right? They are in the process of removing all talents and abilities (including items) that remove cc effects. Then they are going to actually bother to balance CC vs CC resistance.<br />

so they are keeping moonkin form cause people want to be a moonkin, however even though people want to be in treeform that doesn't matter and they are cutting it anyway. Moonkin form brings nothing and neither does tree form. Add to this the fact that dps cds are very useful while healing cd usually get wasted. So why in gods name are they changing tree form again?????????<br />

No, I'm saying that warlock pet damage is a joke because warlock pet dmg is 5% of player dps. YOU are talking about lack of skill for whatever reason. Maybe if you go afk then your pet dps will be higher. It's not my fault that pets don't scale properly, thats what I'm saying.</div></div><hr />

I really wouldn't mind if priests stayed at bottom rung, and yes I play one. They have been at top rung without really working for it for two expansions just by speccing discipline. They have been the perfered pvp healer for 2 expansions. Its time for them to take a back seat or to work really hard to maintain that position.<br />

&quot;[...]Im guessing elemental shamans, shadow priests, moonkins and mages<br />
<br />
<br />
Mages won't have downtime if they play correctly (you don't stand toe to toe with mobs as a mage). Elemental shamans, shadow priests and moonkins have never had downtime if played correctly, and now they will have better gear. Increasing mob damage isn't that big of a deal when you have ways to get mana back quickly and heals.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My point is, downtime is bad, especially in dungeons while leveling. The classes hit the most by this are of course dps mana users. The only class you'll ever wait for in a dungeon is a healer, you'll never wait for a dps getting his mana back. I dont play in the beta so i have no idea how it all works it all works there while leveling. I just hope they dont make the game &quot;boring&quot;, yeah, downtime *is* boring. I guess we'll see how it all turns out.<br />
<br />
Make trash borderline deadly and make it a dps race and I guarantee you people will start waiting for dps to have mana. Also, you always wait before each boss, and boss dps maters much more. By level 65 (when this change comes into affect), if you are having mana issues you have problems. They do need to address the fact that melee dps blows caster dps out of the water (and hell the casters normally can't even keep up with the tank on trash at this point and time) for the first 60 levels (easily) though.<br />
<br />

<br />
although i doubt we'd go back to vanilla where 1 tree (holy) was useful, or tbc (you want to tank?, but you're a paladin.. go heal) or wrath (paladins are balanced, nerf them). But... we'll see how it goes ;)<br />
<br />
Retribution and Protection was still playable in Vanilla. It just wasn't as enjoyable. In TBC, plenty of paladins tanked. They were the prefered trash tanks. They were most definitely the prefered 5 man tank. They just had to understand how to gear themselves, and the ones that thought they geared like warriors were fail. For the better half of WotLK (if not the whole thing) there was nothing at all balanced about retribution. It was the most overpowered class by far. It might still be in PvE since it does very little work to get very big numbers.<br />
<br />
I thought you played a retribution since 1.9 (which was in Vanilla where you just claimed there were not retribution paladins); however, you seem to have a very light grasp of paladin history.</div></div><hr />

And no, Avenger's Shield is not a good spell to use for this because of the retarded mana cost of it (at present, I have 6k mana in prot spec and it costs me about 1500 mana to cast that spell) and the long 1-min cooldown.<br />
<br />
HoR change was because Ret pallies were taunting in PvE for the large amount of damage it can provide and the new mastery would only make it worse. They are also trying to tone down tank threat so having a taunt that forces the target to attack you AND does a high amount of threat is a bit off from their ideas on tanking.<br />
<br />
As for the HoJ change, they're doing the same thing to druids so i'm guessing they want to move away from HoJ working as a stun and an interrupt and just let ret pallies use rebuke for the interrupt (and druids use skull bash).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't get me started on the new &quot;scheme.&quot; If I wanted to dps, there is a spec for that. However, if even everything you said made 100% perfect sense, what you are overlooking is that trees can now cast dps spells(check out the tooltip). So, if they made this change because they want restoration druids to be able to be more offensive, then please explain to me why they made one of the best offensive cool downs part of tree form and allowed trees to cast damaging spells in tree form.<br />

Glyphs being permanent ? Another reason to drop this (&amp;/&quot;*&amp;/ profession<br />
<br />
Yes, because off hands and trinkets sell worth crap, eh? Since they are doing a lot of work to make DMF cards all the rage for pretty much every teir for every class, I don't think you could actually say that inscription won't be ranking in the money. Lets just see if they actually accomplish what they said they wanted to do with the profession.<br />

I just hope that the Hand of Reckoning and Hammer of Justice changes aren't permanent. I thought they increased the damage done by HoR to improve the spell. Did all the warriors and death knights and druids complain that our taunt did damage? I use that spell all the time while doing Loremaster to either 1-shot the mobs or cause them serious hurt. Now the only way to damage a creature (again) is to get within 10 yards of it and whack it with judgement.

Are you serious? Ret paladins were godmodeds on beta accoriding to people posting on forums who play one on, well, beta. YOU don't know how they are do you? Stop applying the current game state to these changes please. For pvp: they got less immunity to kiting (cleanse gone) but got a speed boost and longer judgement. They got new attacks (replaced old ones) , an interrupt (praise the lord eh?), actually more dmg and less &quot;free survivability&quot;. It's shaping up to become a good spec for skilled players, and not so insanely SIMple to play. Time to distinguish the good from the bad rets (not that there aren't any now, but..)<br />

Boub, I hope that one of your (or Blizzard's) potential foul ups in these notes is this crap about Hot Streak. No longer affects Pyroblast? Great! So what the hell is it suppose to do besides cease being a fire mage's best single target DPS mechanic? :(<br />
<br />
you too, learn to read:P<br />
<br />
It says &quot;Pyroblast no longer affects hot streak&quot; , not &quot;hot streak no longer affects pyroblast&quot;.<br />
<br />
In an earlier build, pyro crits could contribute to getting a new hot streak, which was obviously Insanley OP:P<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PS. The increase in lavaburst dmg is justified, believe it or not:P On beta it actually hit for less then on live sometimes:P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right now glyphs are cheap because Blizzard has some expectation that we swap repeatedly. It would be stupid if they were extremely expensive, especially since many of the glyphs are situational. But if Blizzard makes them permanent they'll probably increase their cost of production, and hence cost of purchase, significantly. Probably not to the level of a crafted item, but perhaps more in line with things like epic leg thread/armor.<br />
<br />
Edit: Rukari, your sig made me smile. See Fundamental attribution error (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error).<br />
<br />
Even if they did make the new ones more expensive to make, its not like they can remove the ones made with old world mats. I might exclusively use northrend mats for base materials currently but I trade them in for the lower stuff at the ink trader as many of the good glyphs are lower level. They can't make the skill unlevelable so making them 'more expensive to make&quot; just doesn't work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There goes the dot protection and here comes the continuous dispelling again I do note the horror inflicted after it is great since the vampiric touch damage was pretty disapointing to begin with.<br />
<br />
Mind Spike revamped - Blasts the target for 1082.81 to 1144.05 Shadowfrost damage, and increases the critical strike chance of your next Mind Blast on the target by 30%. Stacks up to 3 times.<br />
<br />
If I'm correct Mind spike damage was not enough to fit in a rotation, the instant mind blast was nice for pvp though. right now it's become something entirely useless, at least for pvp as someone would want to apply mind blast right away to make sure the healing debuff is there. <br />
<br />
Paralysis *New* (Tier 5) - When you critically hit with your Mind Blast, you cause the target to be unable to move for 2/4 sec.<br />
<br />
This is nice since it deals with the immobility of shadowpriests however considering we wont start with the haste values we have now anymore it'll be harder to cast and especially when a rogue/dk/warrior is on you and ready to interupt, this also makes the immobilize(presumably not a stun) useless since it takes too much time to get away when afflicted by poison/hamstring etc that you'll enjoy about 1-2 seconds at most since shadowpriests are always the target.<br />
<br />
It'd be nicer if there was a more passive way to survive like druids with their buff to cast roots on an attacker or maybe in the light of a shadowpriest something that absorbs damage instead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Well, in fairness, we were referring to shadow priests. And, absent the last couple of months, they've been really awful. I'm not suggesting that they deserve to be overpowered (although, if any spec DOES deserve it, it's Spriests or moonkins), but I'd hope to see them stay viable in a 3's setting.</div></div><hr />

By &quot;more useful&quot;, you mean &quot;Druids will get stuck with that duty&quot;. With mana, you can repeatedly cast it from range. Hunters need to use Focus, and can very easily be in a situation where they can't quickly tranq (especially if two are needed), while Rogues need to be in melee range.<br />

Dunno where the info is comming from. But my hots, together with lifebloom, regrowth and nourish is enough to do end game content.

Dungeon and questing downtime: Hell yeah! You are an adventurer, not a Demigod! You have to rest sometime, and i remember quite well where you actually had to work together and care about your group! You have to watch everyone's mana, and proceed when everyone is ready.<br />

Readychecks anyone? In dungeons oh my! What is that? Can't wait to have proper difficulty and teamwork in this game again!<br />

Ps.: Those who whine about the downtime between mobs are not the same people who say WOTLK is easy!<br />
<br />
Every class has it's benefits and inconvenience.<br />
Feg.: <br />
-Shamans can HS every 15 minutes, and walk on water.<br />
-Mages can teleport to main cities and create water and food.<br />
Rogues and warriors don't have things like that, they are specialized on killing.<br />
They also need to stop and eat and bandage.<br />
<br />
The downtime for ranged classes is usually mana, while melee have health regeneration.<br />
Hunters are the ones who are lucky in this regard, but it was like that ever since the game was released.</div></div><hr />
