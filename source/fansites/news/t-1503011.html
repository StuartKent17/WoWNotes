Warlords of Draenor System Performance<br />
As with every expansion, Warlords of Draenor will introduce a number of game-engine upgrades and graphical improvements, including new character models and better textures to help us create lush, detailed environments. Any increase in graphical quality will naturally result in some amount of increase in the game’s required system specs, but we’re working hard to minimize that and ensure that WoW runs well on as wide a range of systems as possible.<br />
<br />
One of our game-engine updates is designed to limit the impact that animating the new models has on players’ frame rates. Our new character models have significantly more “moving parts” and more complex animation than the current models (see our Artcraft: Running of the Bulls (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/13607366/) to get an idea). As a result, the new animations require a bit more memory than the old ones. To counter that, we’ve developed some technology that should keep the impact on your framerate similar to what it is now. Some of this is actually already in place in Patch 5.4.7, and we’re continuing to work to optimize as much as we can—and of course, we’ll be providing an option to keep using the current models if you wish.<br />
<br />
We’re also making several improvements to improve performance in Raids, Dungeons, and Battlegrounds, such as limiting extraneous spell effects in group content, which—along with other benefits such as eliminating some visual clutter—should help with performance. We’re also planning to provide separate options for graphical effects in Raids or Battlegrounds, so you can disable processor-intensive features such as shadows and reflections solely in those environments. We’ll be testing all of these updates out in the upcoming beta, though keep in mind that beta performance doesn’t reflect the final version of the game. We’ll still be in the process of optimization, and the beta will include additional development tools that impact system performance.<br />
<br />
One of our longstanding goals is to make sure WoW runs well on as broad a range of systems as possible, and that continues to be a top priority. We’ll have more details on the expansion’s system requirements closer to launch, and we can’t wait to show you more of Warlords of Draenor.</div></div><hr />

Everything that was said about PvP in this video has just risen my hype for WoD goddamn it sounds good.<br />
<br />
Ashran looks amazing, the New way they are handling PvP gear Ilvl's is cool and Arena Skirmishes sounds awesome.<br />
<br />
Skirmishes giving Honor/small chance of gear for winning means I can avoid Random BG's and just solo queue/duo queue with friends and grind honour out in a fun way WITH my friends that are a lower ilevel without killing my ratings.<br />
<br />
Also Holinka is a Total bro.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">War30</div><div class="date">2014-04-23, 04:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will just say this...Removing crowd control in battlegrounds is the best way to go. All you need to do is limit the numbers of healers per battleground like you do with raids. Plus also make it impossible for people to change their SPEC during the battleground so like for example a shaman queues up as an elemental he should not be able to go restoration while the battleground is being played. Crowd control is only used against mobs in dungeons mostly. But players burn these mobs so fast that there’s no need for crowd control. They have no effect on bosses as well. So why have it at all. All these spells are doing is taking up actionbar space.<br />
<br />
There solved the problem.</div></div><hr />

Ashran will have a Horde and Alliance fortress on opposite ends of the island, with staging areas behind each base. This area will have vendors, let you duel, and be a place for PvP players to hang out. Each faction's base is fully manned with NPCs that are fighting a battle. The main battle takes place in the center, slowly pushing towards the other faction's fortress. There are objectives on the outer edges of the island. It shouldn't feel too much like a battleground, more like unstructured PvP with some points of interest. Ashran won't be ready for the initial builds.*<br />

yep, my thoughts also, I thought it whas a bg, but if its just an open place, not real structure pvp is going to happen. If it was a bg than it was great, 40 against 40 gathering stuff and killing, getting objectivs and stuff, but if its open, nothing going to happen. It has to be a bg where people have to queue for otherwise it's not gonna work. I was pumped up for this, but not anymore. I thought I read somewhere in the begin that it was to be like the old AV, but this is shit, its going to be deserted in a couple of weeks, with here and there some afk people.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jone</div><div class="date">2014-04-23, 10:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe that the ilvl Increase on PvP Gear will create the same situation like at Mists Launch where it's too hard for new Players to get into PvP as the Gear disparity is too high. It will also create awkward Gameplay such as people getting an Alt on a second Account and hitting their Main in order to increase ilvl and solo some Rare Mob for loot and the like.<br />
It depends a bit on the ilvl of PvE gear compared to PvP gear. I would be surprised if the PvP ilvl is significantly higher in PvP than PvE gear. If PvP gear is 660/690 it would be reasonable to assume that PvE is somewhere in the middle. Making PvP gear slightly worse for PvE and slightly better for PvP.<br />
<br />
Having a cross faction alt hit you for increased ilvl is a bit awkward though, I totally agree on that. :D<br />
<br />
<br />
The better solution would have been to reduce PvE ilvl while in PvP combat down to lower_than_pvp gear. That way pvp gear would remain the best for pvp without new players doing abysmall damage/dying in a few seconds and being alienated by that.<br />
Unless the difference between PvP ilvl and PvE ilvl is really large I don't think the net result of reduced PvE vs. increased PvP makes that much a difference, reducing PvE ilvl when you're fighting an opposing faction actually makes ganking easier if anything. Take the rare mob example: You're in PvE gear and a different player wants to ruin the kill for you and grab it for himself, when he attacks you, your item level will actually drop, effectively making the rare mob tougher to kill.<br />
<br />
So both approaches have pros and cons. Personally I kind of like the idea they have presented here, if they can make it work in a reasonable way.<br />
<br />
<br />
There also should be an Un-PvP Set in all PvE Sets that reduces your PvP Power and PvP Resilience by 10% or so in order to avoid the Situation of some players picking certain PvE 2Sets for PvP (Such as Hunters in Cataclysm).<br />
A fairly simple solution here would be to maybe just disable the PvE set bonuses, at least in instanced PvP. Although this again goes against the philosophy of not having two separate rule sets unless absolutely necessary. Honestly though, I kind of feel that the set bonuses can be a bit over the top at times, same with trinkets really. Having some trinkets so good that you don't want to upgrade the previous tier seems a bit against the purpose of a new tier of loot. :confused:</div></div><hr />

If it was a bg than it was great, 40 against 40 gathering stuff and killing, getting objectivs and stuff, but if its open, nothing going to happen. It has to be a bg where people have to queue for otherwise it's not gonna work. I was pumped up for this, but not anymore. I thought I read somewhere in the begin that it was to be like the old AV, but this is shit, its going to be deserted in a couple of weeks, with here and there some afk people.<br />

yep, it has to be bg where you have to queue for, this is not gonna work out right.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jone</div><div class="date">2014-04-23, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are huge Jumps even within one tier. For Example I remember Simulationcraft having certain Classes Sim 130k DPS at the best ilvl single Target for Tier14 at Mists Launch while in recent Challenge Modes someone mentioned having 50k DPS (463 ilvl Heroic Dungeons). Blizzard will keep these big jumps as they mentioned and it is nice for PvE in many ways but not for PvP.<br />
<br />
The Mists of Pandaria Launch PvP Gear had immense PvP Power&amp;Resilience to compensate but this made it hard for starting PvP Players because their gear was so weak compared to the Concuest Set, especially after Upgrades were added in 5.1.<br />
<br />
I believe PvE Gear nerfs for PvP are better than the other way around because it makes PvP easier to access and more a Game of skill then who has the better Gear, as PvE Content fits that part.<br />
<br />
And, Again: The Abuse Potential is high, people may ask a friend on the Opposite faction to gently touch them for improved PvE Power when Blizzard decides to add some sort of challenging WorldBoss, a tough rare Mob, or whatever else will damand good gear. <br />
<br />
I don't like how right now PvE Gear is Best_in_Slot for doing uninstanced PvP and the Solution described by the Developers in the Video definitely helps in that regard, but I fear it might just turn the swith to PvP Gear being Best_in_Slot for PvE Content which is not what should be done.<br />
Ah yes, I was assuming the DPS jumps within one tier would be a bit less insane with the item squish, and was not taking item upgrades into consideration either (which I'm not sure is staying or not).<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm a little on the fence of what I prefer to be honest. Nothing would be better than PvP being best in slot for PvP (regardless of whether it's instanced or world) and PvE best in slot for PvE, while still keeping PvE gear viable for PvP and vice versa, and limiting the abuse potential. :) I guess Blizzard has a bit of work on their hands here. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a PvE'er, I can't imagine myself queueing for pvp in WoD without a full set of pvp gear now, and I definitely don't see myself grinding out a main set, off set AND pvp set on any character. As the gap in gear expands, so does the divide bewteen pve and pvp.</div></div><hr />

It's not going to work like that. The moment you hit your target if it's a player your 2nd lvl stats are used to calculate dmg. Otherwise it uses 1st level. There's no trailing buff. It's calculated per hit. I wonder what the performance implications for this are.<br />
<br />
Also you won't have to 'grind' an off gear set. The moment you switch spec say from Resto Shaman (main) to enh Shaman (off), the stats on you gear will switch too. From int to agi. They won't be ideal probably but good enough for an offset.<br />
So in effect you have to grind a main set (pve) and pvp set</div></div><hr />

Interesting. I suppose that makes sense in a strictly damage dealing scenario, but wouldn't a 2nd ilvl affect healing stats and or damage mitigation as well?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it's quite weird yes. For healing, if you're in combat and on your combat table there's a pvp opponent maybe there's a calculation wrt how many players vs mobs and who attacked you more in the last 5 secs window.<br />
For mitigation and I'm thinking more about stamina and hp I don't really know. I mean will people's HP move up and down. It's quite odd. We'll have to wait and see.<br />
I'm not too worried.<br />
<br />
I'm more worried about the lameness of some classes going into warlords such as hunters. So bland and flavorless</div></div><hr />
