Only not really, Classic launched 26th-27th August. 4 days more completes August. Patch comes out 24-25th september. Guess what that plus 4 days makes. Spoiler Alert: It's not 1 month and 1 days.

Month: 30 days. Not always? No, but on average, and it's also how Blizzard calculates game time. September 24th will be the 5th Tuesday after Classic release and it released on a Monday. Try to reserve your tone of superiority to yourself the next time.</div></div><hr />

Correct in how Blizzard Calculates Game Time.. which is why your arrogance is completely in the wrong (when you're wrong.) When 8.2.5 is RELEASED.. Classic would be out for 28 days of GAME TIME.. not 30 or 31. So Please get your facts straight.</div></div><hr />

Why not their a company who wants your money, so why should people sign up and play anything else? <br />
Well I don't know maybe cause your game has been boring AF lately Blizzard lol. I've been playing since 2006 and I have never been this long off the game as I have been in BFA. 2 weeks off the game tops, it's been months for BFA now.</div></div><hr />

Try to reserve your tone of superiority to yourself the next time.<br />
<br />
5th Tuesday means it's been 29-30 days. You do know that 4 weeks = 28 days, because it is literally 4*7 (since each week has 7 days), so that equals 28, not 30. Not 31 days. Rarely does a month have 29 days, and afaik, unless you have a monthly recurrent subscription, you always buy a one time subscription of 30 days, not 31, not 29.<br />
I would beg of you to go look at your calendar and see for just how many months this ''1 month and 1 day'' is applicable, because as I said before, unless it's February, and spoiler alert yet again - it's not, you are just talking literal bullshit. <br />
Also did you know that the only substantial content for 8.2.5, aside from 'evergreen' content, is truly only the war campaign and the bee faction? If you think that this is not worth your sub, then simply do not resub till 8.3. I will keep my air of superiority, and rub it all over the face of whoever is whining about BfA for the sake for fucking whining, and that's what you are doing atm.</div></div><hr />

When 8.2.5 is RELEASED.. Classic would be out for 28 days of GAME TIME.. not 30 or 31. So Please get your facts straight.<br />

Then you wake up and remember that the High King, that would be fighting with her in the Shadowlands in your scenario, is the one that released Saurfang so he could help deal with the Sylvanas problem.</div></div><hr />

See how silly that sounds?<br />
<br />
Uhhh, 13.1 is still supposed to release on the 30th. 13 was always scheduled to release when it did.<br />

What problem????She has always been the way she is.It's not like killing allies and enemies will be out of her character.Wrath gate is a good example.As far as i'm concerned she is all about results and efficiency.</div></div><hr />

Yes. With 8.2.5 the War Campaign quests are no longer reputation gated. You just have to be 120 &amp; do them in order</div></div><hr />

For the bee pet that's already in the game, it's not rep based. You had to do a daily quest 7 times and then you got the pet. I imagine the mount will be gated in a similar way.</div></div><hr />

Why would you assume that means no 8.3? Eternal Palace had nothing to do with the war campaign. Not really.</div></div><hr />

I doubt there will be a large void of content. If there's no 8.3, then perhaps that just means 9.0 will come sooner</div></div><hr />

<br />
120 is max level so you wont get more xp when you're 120. With Party sync you're effectively at lvl 80, with skills and abilities that you only had at lvl 80</div></div><hr />

Between this and them not having Zandalari or Kul Tiran classes sussed out a year after announcing them as allied races. (They said it was a typo, but then they had to reclarify the actual classes twice shows they didn't. Wouldn't that be the first thing you do?) is another example of BFA's incompetence</div></div><hr />

Just logged in. 11 servers at Medium, 3 at Full, and all the rest are High (no Low population servers). At worst, they are holding steady...so, yeah, Classic is clearly still going strong 1 month later.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah think so! I mean, can't possibly see why you would want to downgrade your level to play with friends and don't get any benefit from it :D the main difference from this party sync and the usual level scale is that its YOU that go back in level, and all spells/passives/items that require higher level than, say ,lvl 80, aren't available to you. You're, for all intents and purposes, back to level 80 until you leave the party sync</div></div><hr />
