Curse.com (http://www.curse.com/articles/details/2625/) posted a video interview of Tigole on their site. Some parts are rather interesting. <br />
<br />
Raid composition in 10-man raid is definitely identified as a problem. (Which means it will probably be easier to add hybrid classes to a Zul'aman raid)<br />
Arena powerleveling is an issue, and they're looking for a way to nerf it and equipment powerleveling in high-rank teams.<br />
Item upgrade from BC to WotLK should be the same as WoW from BC. Basically, you'll get fast upgrades with an average gear, but people with equipment from the last tier dungeons will keep it for a while before finding a decent replacement.<br />
Heroic Badges will drop from Zul'aman and Karazhan bosses. (2.2 or 2.3)<br />
A tons of items will be added to the heroic badge vendor. With items to equip for all classes (and also enough items to fill the itemization gap for moonkins druids and retribution paladins)<br />

Shaman changes<br />
We already noticed a few shaman changes during the blizzcon (see the Blizzcon changes mega-list), Drysc posted a few more things about it. <br />
<br />
The change I believe you're referring to is that a new talent would be replacing the &quot;Two-Handed Axes and Maces&quot; talent. If that new talent does in fact go in - keep in mind these changes are in-development - then two-handed axes and maces would be trainable for all shaman. Please keep in mind that we may implement changes, test them, and then revert or wholly alter them.<br />
<br />
Clarity Incoming: As far as I'm aware swords aren't being considered to be usable with a talent, or as a base trainable weapon type.<br />

This just reinforces the argument that a low-end requirement to being allowed to purchase the gear is a bad idea, as this practice will further shut down those trying to improve the right way so they can never buy the new stuff... and it's likely that arena powerleveling will increase if you need to have a 1600/1800/2000/whatever rating to buy the stuff.<br />
Got your points saved up from your sucky team, but can't get high enough rating to buy? No problem, just pay us X gold and join our team for one week, get your 30% of matches, buy your gear, then &quot;see ya!&quot;.<br />
Need points &amp; rating, welcome to the rotation.<br />
<br />
Dear Blizzard, please don't break arenas with this crap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you. I was going to post the same argument and similar sentiments, but you summed it up very nicely. We all know how well rating/ranking requirements fared under the old pre-TBC Honor System. In a nutshell, players were exercising exraordinarily unhealthy (weekend Rockstar-fueled marathons) and, in some cases, unethical (ghostmousing) means to remain competitive under a broken system, while the rest of the population suffered the indignities of getting &quot;rolled&quot; by elite few that had the rank-exclusive gear. In those days, it was commonplace for lesser ranked PvPers to attend 40-mans to get alternative PvE gear just to remain competitive in BGs.<br />
<br />
Putting a minimum rating requirement on the purchase of Arena rewards is short-sighted. It sends the message that effort alone is unrewarded.<br />
<br />
Does Blizzard really want to go back to forcing struggling and semi-casual PvPers to go to endgame instances for a remote chance at worthwhile alternatives to gear they'll no longer be able to purchase through their efforts in Arena? Better question yet, does Blizzard really want to encourage the profiteering of arena ratings by creating a system where high-ranked teams can scalp desparate players looking to to spend their hard-earned points but are struggling to break out of the lower brackets?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly, it would makes things worse, not better.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ronnosh</div><div class="date">2007-08-09, 03:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Apparently it's the upper rated teams crying for the change because they're getting rolled by low and mid rated teams in the similar gear. First and foremost, while the rating denotes your rank among the other teams, it's by no means should be used as the sole measuring stick of a team's skills. That's why the ratings fluctuate in the first place as teams win and lose.</div></div><hr />
