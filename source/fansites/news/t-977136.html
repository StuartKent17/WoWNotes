Flamewaker Subjugator and Animator packs should now behave as originally intended. As Flamewaker Subjugators become damaged, Flamewaker Animators will be attackable, and must be killed quickly to prevent a significant buildup of Unstable Magma.<br />
<br />
<br />

Bottle of Dalaran Red, Bottle of Aged Dalaran Red, Cask of Dalaran Red, and Cask of Aged Dalaran Red should no longer award the player the next tier of Dalaran Red when placed on the ground<br />

Quests and Creatures<br />
<br />
The Brunnhildar transformation in the Storm Peaks should again be applied correctly to flying characters, and will not cause mounted characters to dismount. The transformation should not affect druids in Flight Form.<br />
Alliance and Horde players are able to teleport to Anachronos as many times as they wish even after abandoning and re-accepting the quest &quot;A Legendary Engagement&quot;.<br />
Players will no longer go invisible in Uldum during the quest &quot;Premature Explosionation&quot;. If players logout or disconnect during the cutscene, they will return to Khartut's Tomb instead of being ported to a nearby graveyard.</div></div><hr />

Kinda weird that they have waited this long with the DM nerf tho.<br />
Its a mechanic that 1 dps per group has to do, if no-one has ever done it apart from the healer/tank, since those are the ones that did it before ofc, you are risking a wipe and if one does happen the entire party disbands.<br />
Might as well remove the entire mechanic from the fight :&lt;</div></div><hr />

Pretty bad man. I tried to tank some all of last weekend and you wouldnt believe the amount of people who just plain dont know fights, dont know their class, and leave at the slightest sign of trouble.

+1 I also play a tank and I'm continually amazed at folks who don't understand this fight. So many dumb-smack wipes on this boss. I'm happy to see the nerfs. Now maybe the group won't break up when we hit this boss.<br />
<br />
I just want the orbs, and this always gets in my way on this instance.<br />

but its such an easy mechanic. stay at the bottom of the ramp, kill fire things. you even get to practice on the other harvest golems before the fight. Anyone with half a brain can get it. Its not necessarily a change that affects me, because I will get it regardless of how much damage the elementals do. But still, such an unnecessary nerf to an already faceroll fight. They aren't fixing anything here. They're just making fresh 85 players more and more shitty.</div></div><hr />

Did this fight really need a nerf? Are players that bad? I remember back in 4.1 , in all Blue's no higher than 346 iLvL , Group failed at boss so I quick changed to my Turtle and killed it with everyone except the BOT dead. I mean seriously it was never hard , and now it is getting another nerf. STOP Catering to people who just want to push buttons and get epics , it doesn't work that way. Also half the reason people suck in these instances is because of the way iLvL is determined before entering. Items in bags should not determine iLvL , equipped items only.</div></div><hr />

They'd have to recode how evading works...which isn't the best solution at all. Its like recoding how aggro works just because one boss has an aggro bug. Its not very practical, and if you screw something up while recoding something that important, it would effect the entire game in a negative manner.</div></div><hr />

<br />
New 85's dings every day and you can enter a heroic at ilevel 329 if everyone in the group is at that level it's hard.<br />
<br />
nothing was hard about a heroic in ilvl329 gear. Maybe there was some challenge but I know that when cata released and we all raced to max level we knew what we were up against. We knew that it wasnt going to be handed to us anymore once we hit heroic dungeons.<br />
<br />
I think more of what people are upset about isn't that this stuff is easy for them, but rather that Blizz is making it SO easy to be ab absolute tard in this game right now. I understand the nerfs of raids to get people through them easier. I like that because my group is close to having all the heroics on farm and a slight throttle back would be nice so we can be geared up for Deathwing when it's time. <br />
<br />
I know the only reason I am upset with these kind of nerfs is because there is so much other stuff broken right now that can be fixed, yet blizz still sits around looking at slightly old content instead of what the majority of players are actually dealing with. It's just like the BT Map BS. Was that really something we needed a whole patch for? Did people really get lost in that place? Hell, I dont even know how to look at my map there. It's so straight through that it hurts. sorry for the rant... long day at work.</div></div><hr />

An even easier way to do it is to stand a little (not too far though) ways up the ramp and use the steam blast to knock the mobs off, forcing them to start from scratch. This will also automagically get you the achievement without the healer needing to watch the Reaver's health.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, there was a problem and it was confirmed on the Blizz forums (a Blue even responded &quot;We are aware there is a problem&quot;). If I recall correctly, the DPS said their attacks kept getting evaded by the adds and the magma thingies kept spawning like crazy. Maybe that's been fixed, this was a good month or so since I've tried.</div></div><hr />
