2.4 Information very soon<br />
This post is fairly interesting actually, it seems that the first batch of new information about the 2.4 patch will be posted very soon. (This week ?)<br />
While I understand players' frustrations about the dearth of information, please keep in mind that we can't always dictate that is announced when. There are factors such as development progress, release coordination, and such.<br />
<br />
For the Community team, our current focus is to bring you more information about the upcoming 2.4 patch. There are several features in there that we think you will love, and we want to get that information out once we are back in the office.<br />
<br />
<br />
Death Knight<br />
A few more details on the Death Knight, nearly the same as usual but according to this post it seems that the primary role of the DK will be tanking, not damage dealing. (That's not really a surprise, they're some kind of Dark Paladins after all)<br />
The death knight will be a tank/dps class. Currently there is an under-representation of tank classes, so the decision was made add a tank class to balance the class representation. A great quote that the dev team mentions is that the Death Knight is &quot;epic but equal,&quot; meaning the experience is meant to be epic, but the death knight will be the equal of other classes. Otherwise there would be an over-representation of tanks and not enough healers and dps in the world.<br />
<br />
<br />
Molten Core completed with 3 players<br />
So ... you're feeling like you wasted your time in game during holidays ? Well, some people are worse than you, and decided it would be fun to run Molten Core with ... 3 level 70 players. That's time wasting, useless, but damn it's impressive and this is how you do it :<br />
Lucifron: priest, druid, hunter (pet acting as a foil for the adds' mind control; the curse was dealt with by me shifting out of bearform to decurse when it got applied, and then shifting back in)<br />
Magmadar: priest, druid, hunter (because we were there, really; hunter also occasionally tranq-shotted Magmadar's Frenzy, I believe - I didn't exactly check, I was too busy trying to avoid getting feared into conflags)<br />
Gehennas: priest, mage, warrior (itty bitty feral druid mana pool + curse needing removed immediately = disaster, so I couldn't quite have tanked that particular fight - so the warrior tanked it, and I decursed / DPS'd as a mage... as it was, I ended up having to chain mana potions to keep on top of it; we failed once due to me getting shadowbolted right after running out of rain of fire)<br />
Garr to Golemagg: priest, mage, warrior (because we were there, really - did it all in one clear, one-shotted the lot of them)<br />
Sulfuron to Ragnaros: priest, druid, warrior (for pretty obvious reasons; large amounts of adds meant we wanted two tanks)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You can read the full story on this page (http://community.livejournal.com/worldofwarcraft/6454495.html) with details, loots, screenshots, and cookies. Oh, they also 3-manned Razorgore (http://community.livejournal.com/worldofwarcraft/6458389.html) in BWL. <br />

Addon - AutoProfitX<br />
Another addon today, probably the simplest I ever posted. <br />
<br />
AutoProfitX (http://files.wowace.com/AutoProfitX/AutoProfitX.zip) will sell all the gray items in your inventory just by pushing a button when you're talking to a vendor, you can also have it sell selected white items. Try it, and you'll never play without it again. <br />

Maybe if your goal was to post an example of &quot;When using libraries is bad&quot; you'd be right, but AutoProfitX is a horrible monster of a mod.<br />

Oh, and more mods exist then ones on WoWAce just so you know. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, way I see it is there's already plenty for 25-man raids, so it's 5-man casual that they're talking about.<br />
<br />
Means we'll need more jobs for tanks in 25-man raids though .... Blizz better get designing!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
There are plenty of addons that sell gray things on the push of a button - I actually have two installed (one just for that, the other I think it is a feature of a mage addon, that also allows to buy reagents and similar &quot;stuff&quot;).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Siedre</div><div class="date">2008-01-02, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I prefer Automaton to AutoProfitX (also a wowace add-on). With auto selling of grey items there's no button clicking within the vendor menu. It just &quot;does&quot; it. It has a multitude of other auto features, including auto-accept invites from guildies/friends-list players, auto-accept summons (possibly on a 1.8min delay), auto-click bg queues, auto-repair, auto lifebar turn-on when entering combat, and more. You can turn them all on or off individually.</div></div><hr />

Why was it useless or anymore of a time sink than grinding out any other instance? As long as they had fun running it then it wasn't a waste. :)</div></div><hr />

Yup, it's here. Blame the 15% of Vista users on this site who won't let me embed the video because their OS can't handle it. ^^<br />
<br />
<br />
Um...I'm not entirely sure what you're talking about. I'm using Vista, and it handles embedded videos just fine. DivX has had a Vista-capable web player for the last 8 months at least (I know, I've been using it). It used to be beta but they recently released the final version of it. So...yeah, I'm not entirely sure what you're smoking about Vista not handling embeded video files (of any type)...</div></div><hr />

Do not trust people using Vista... you can tell they are not 100% bright because they use Vista ;D</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is because they're using an old version of DivX web player. Tell them to quit QQ'ing and update the darn thing. ;)<br />

<br />
I've been using Vista on my desktop since March and got a new laptop with it in July. I've honestly had no real problems with it on either computer, and I'm a long-time hardcore gamer so...yeah. However, I do have real life friends that have had absolute horror stories with it.</div></div><hr />
