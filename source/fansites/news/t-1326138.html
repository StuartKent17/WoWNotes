Patch 5.4 - Ghostcrawler Interview<br />
Ghostcrawler was in Asia last week and QQ was able to sit down with him for an interview (http://games.qq.com/a/20130725/003240.htm). Keep in mind that things are often lost in translation or mistranslated! Thanks to ngacnlcq (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/565579-ngacnlcq) for the translation (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1326134-Ghostcrawler-Interview?p=21919749#post21919749).<br />
<br />
<br />
The item level squish (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2541-The-Great-Item-Squish-%28or-Not%29-of-Pandaria) might (will?) take place next expansion.<br />
There is still no timeline for the DotA battleground release.<br />
The Hearthstone board (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/july/Hearthstone_Gameboard.jpg) that was added in a PTR build is just for decoration and there is no plan to add Hearthstone to WoW.<br />
The Lesser Charms that may be added to the Asian store are there as a convenience item for players that may not have time to do their daily quests that week or players who just want to save time. There are no plans to add items to the store that will increase player stats.<br />
Patch 5.4 is the last content (raid?) patch, but there will be bugfix and balance patches after it, as well as a pre-expansion patch.<br />
If a fourth class role was ever implemented, it might provide buffs or support, but it would be a big change (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/340960365020078080) to the game and is very unlikely to happen (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/361996829426057216).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 5.4 - Timeless Isle Armor<br />
The Timeless Isle will allow players to obtain item level 496 and 535 gear through drops found around the island. <br />
<br />
The items used to create the 496 armor are found all over the island in chests and dropped by mobs, similar to the items used to create armor in Battlefield: Barrens. The Burden of Eternity (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/103982-burden-of-eternity) is a rare drop from mobs, found in the Blazing Chest (http://ptr.wowdb.com/objects/221673-blazing-chest), or in one of Kukuru's chests (ptr.wowdb.com/items/101538-kukurus-cache-key#related:opens_!).<br />
<br />
The item level 535 version of the gear is called &quot;Timeless&quot; and is obtained by using a Burden of Eternity (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/103982-burden-of-eternity) on an item that creates armor, such as a Timeless Leather Helm (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/102280-timeless-leather-helm).<br />
<br />
Patch 5.4 normal difficulty gear has an item level of 553, while flex gear is 540, and raid finder gear is 528. This makes the 535 Timeless gear a nice upgrade for players that will only raid in Raid Finder difficulty and a temporary upgrade for players who will be raiding Flex difficulty. It is also an upgrade for players who are currently raiding Throne of Thunder Normal, as well as any Heroic raiders still missing a slot.<br />

Unholy Presence (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/48265) now grants a flat 10% Haste to all things, up from Haste for melee (attack speed and Rune regeneration) only. The movement speed buff remains unchanged.<br />
Fixed a bug that caused Improved Blood Presence (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/50371) and Runic Corruption (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/51462) to incorrectly increase activation rates of some trinkets and effects.<br />
<br />

Ghoul's Leap and Gnaw abilities are no longer on a global cooldown, and no longer cost Energy.<br />

Past Legendary Items for Patch 5.4<br />
The legendary meta gem will still function, but Sha-touched gems and sockets will not be applicable to new 5.4 items.<br />
<br />
No extra sockets in 5.4? Then why the hell did you update the 5.2 weapons from ToT to be able to use them? This is incredibly stupid and seems like a total oversight. 1750g for a new weapon socket is SO not that expensive. <br />
We updated the 5.2 weapons to allow the additional socket (but not the Sha-touched gems) because a very large number of players were getting their extra sockets just in time for the patch to drop (and thus, would only be able to use their reward for a week or two). That's not the case with 5.4. The 5.2 legendary meta gem will continue to function, and the 5.3 epic cloak will upgrade into the 5.4 legendary.<br />
<br />
We feel that, at this point, the Sha-Touched gem and socket have had plenty of time to be useful and it's time for them to go. As Lothrik mentioned, we'll be balancing content assuming that they're not present anyway. That said, nothing on the PTR is final, and we are still open to discussion on the topic.

Proving Grounds Feedback<br />
Just a quick note that we're still doing a lot of tuning for Proving Grounds, and your feedback has been (and continues to be) invaluable. There will be a bunch more bug fixes and tweaks in the next build for testing.<br />
<br />
In particular, the next build has a lot of work done on the AI for the friendly party members in the Healer trials. Once it hits the PTR, we'd really appreciate any feedback on how they're acting, especially specific examples of things they do that seem &quot;dumb.&quot; I don't have an exact timeframe on when that build will go up, but it should be within the next few days (UPDATE: should be today!)

RPPMScaling with Rune Regeneration Mechanics<br />
After some investigation, we found that rune regeneration mechanics were, indeed, giving an unintended increase to RPPM proc rates. Unholy in particular gains a significant performance boost from this bug. We're going to fix the bug, but we'll also be compensating Unholy.<br />
<br />
In the next build, Unholy Presence will give pure haste, rather than just attack speed. This will allow it to (legitimately) increase proc rates for RPPM mechanics. Runic Corruption and Improved Blood Presence, however, will no longer have an effect on RPPM proc rates.

Because the fucking engine has to work in 32 bit.<br />
<br />
The number 2,147,483,647 is also the maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer in computing. It is therefore the maximum value for variables declared as int in many programming languages running on popular computers, and the maximum possible score, money etc. for many video games. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2147483647)<br />
It's no that they want it or not. THE GAME DOES NOT WORK WITH NUMBERS THAT HIGH. They stated in the past that the game simply won't work with numbers that high. They had to stealth nerf Threat because the cap was reached at Deathwing 25HC and it screwed with the boss. Lei Shen 25HC has 1,747,600,896 health and he's not the last boss of the expansion. Boss health can't go over 2,147,483,647 or the game will crash.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is what happens when Pacman reaches the maximum number supported.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pac-Man was designed to have no ending – as long as the player keeps at least one life, he or she should be able to play the game indefinitely. However, a bug keeps this from happening: Normally, no more than seven fruit are displayed at the bottom of the screen at any given time. But when the internal level counter, which is stored in a single byte (8 bits), reaches 255, the subroutine that draws the fruit erroneously &quot;rolls over&quot; this number to zero, causing it to try to draw 256 fruit instead of the usual seven.<br />
This corrupts the bottom of the screen and the entire right half of the maze with seemingly random symbols, making it impossible to eat enough dots to beat the level. Because this effectively ends the game, this &quot;split-screen&quot; level is often referred to as the &quot;kill screen&quot;. Emulators and code analysis have revealed what would happen should this 256th level be cleared: The fruit and intermissions would restart at level 1 conditions, but the enemies would retain their higher speed and invulnerability to power pellets from the higher stages.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
The number 2,147,483,647 is also the maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer in computing. It is therefore the maximum value for variables declared as int in many programming languages running on popular computers, and the maximum possible score, money etc. for many video games. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2147483647)<br />
It's no that they want it or not. THE GAME DOES NOT WORK WITH NUMBERS THAT HIGH. They stated in the past that the game simply won't work with numbers that high. They had to stealth nerf Threat because the cap was reached at Deathwing 25HC and it screwed with the boss. Lei Shen 25HC has 1,747,600,896 health and he's not the last boss of the expansion. Boss health can't go over 2,147,483,647 or the game will crash.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is what happens when Pacman reaches the maximum number supported.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pac-Man was designed to have no ending – as long as the player keeps at least one life, he or she should be able to play the game indefinitely. However, a bug keeps this from happening: Normally, no more than seven fruit are displayed at the bottom of the screen at any given time. But when the internal level counter, which is stored in a single byte (8 bits), reaches 255, the subroutine that draws the fruit erroneously &quot;rolls over&quot; this number to zero, causing it to try to draw 256 fruit instead of the usual seven.<br />
This corrupts the bottom of the screen and the entire right half of the maze with seemingly random symbols, making it impossible to eat enough dots to beat the level. Because this effectively ends the game, this &quot;split-screen&quot; level is often referred to as the &quot;kill screen&quot;. Emulators and code analysis have revealed what would happen should this 256th level be cleared: The fruit and intermissions would restart at level 1 conditions, but the enemies would retain their higher speed and invulnerability to power pellets from the higher stages.&quot;<br />

Being unnecessarily hostile there sonny. I just said that this change is completely unnecessarily and doesn't require change from player perspective. That's why I'm tired of the bandwagon harping on about how the item squish is so epically required.<br />

So someone takes the time to explain to you why its required and even explaining the numbers and giving an example of what can happen with other games in similar situations... And your responce is to tell him off and that you're still right?<br />

<br />
Selling elder charms for players who want to &quot;save time&quot; really makes me sad. I don't know if it is because of the elder charms itself, or because of Blizzard's excuse &quot;for players who want to save time&quot;. I honestly don't know what is worse.<br />
<br />
It is funny how they even say &quot;we have no intention of selling itens that will increase player status&quot; and yet, sell elder charms. Basically what they are saying here is &quot;we do not sell itens with status, but HEY! We can sell you time advantage so you can get your itens with status twice as fast than those loosers who don't pay!&quot;<br />

That's not actually what happens at all, no. It's possible to make Ra-den increase his health so much in 25 man that he passes the magical limit... And ends up at 1 health but unkillable. <br />

Saying &quot;the game will crash&quot; means you think Blizzard has no concept of error handling or graceful degradation. Just don't.<br />

Maybe if the western market mass quits, maybe we will get some love too!

Seriously a massive joke how much more blizzard is a money hungry grabbing company as opposed to back in the old days.<br />

Jesus Christ you are stupid. Do you even know why a large percentage of Asian gamers are quitting? Because free to play games with paid convenience are much more appealing to their limited hourly play style. Of course you knew that, right?<br />

And how the hell is selling LESSER charms ANYTHING like getting heroic gear or achievements? You're only allowed 3 coins per week anyway and they only work for LFR. Even then, you're still not guaranteed loot.</div></div><hr />

I've leveled a few characters to 90 in the last few weeks. From what I've been dealing with, by the time I'm able to acquire the resources (stupid BoP Harmonies...) to make the gear, I already acquired better gear through LFR/scenarios. On 2 of my 3 fresh 90s I was in LFR within 48 hours of hitting 90. And on my main I have a bank FULL of enchanting mats that I just can't sell. Professions just seem like another mini game this xpac.</div></div><hr />

And you speak for the community because? You only speak for yourself too, and I agree with the guy you quoted :) I rather have 1mil or 2 mil hp than go back to 10-20k ... It's called progression... and although I don't want squish I think they did overdo the item level increase this expansion... going from 300k when u ding 90 to over 600k when you are BiS now(prolly more than 800k in 5.4) is kinda ridiculous. they should increase by very little between tiers...only between expansions should there really be a noticeable increase(say 50 ilvls) otherwise it should be like 10~ ilvls between each tier...</div></div><hr />

And no, I'm not trying to disagree or rebel like you so incorrectly assumed, but I'm stating my disagreement with Blizzard wasting time on something like that when there are new and more exciting features they could work on instead. On top of that, if they do it quick and decrease everything by a certain percentage, like say 80%, I don't even mind it as that is done quickly, but what people are suggesting is making older content harder and make soloing older raids impossible for one.<br />

&quot;Now there are some very real computational limitations. PCs just can’t quickly perform math on very large numbers, so we’d have to solve all of those problems as well. Even today, tanks can hit the ten digit threat cap on some encounters.&quot;</div></div><hr />

You only speak for yourself too, and I agree with the guy you quoted :) I rather have 1mil or 2 mil hp than go back to 10-20k ... It's called progression... and although I don't want squish I think they did overdo the item level increase this expansion... going from 300k when u ding 90 to over 600k when you are BiS now(prolly more than 800k in 5.4) is kinda ridiculous. they should increase by very little between tiers...only between expansions should there really be a noticeable increase(say 50 ilvls) otherwise it should be like 10~ ilvls between each tier...<br />
<br />
I think the problem with that is the many different levels of each raid. If each tier was only 10 ilevel difference, heroic gear wouldn't be &quot;worth the effort&quot; when it's only 8 points above LFR gear. IMO it's not ilevel that's to worry about, but the stats that come with it. Example: Enhance Shaman tier 15 5 piece set- LFR gives 4924 agi; Heroic gives 7012 agi. I don't feel like doing math, but that's roughly a 40% increase of the main stat in the SAME TIER! That's just a bit excessive. Those numbers should be the difference between expansions, not the difference between item sets of the same tier.</div></div><hr />

If you don't understand enough about something you're better off to keep your trap shut.<br />
<br />
This isn't a matter of whether or not they want to do this. They HAVE to do it at some point whether or not you want them to or not.<br />
<br />
They also want it to be quick to read. It's easier to read 1000-2000 dmg vs big numbers.<br />
<br />
Like i said, there is no reason for the item squish not to happen. It sounds like you're arguing for the sake of arguing.<br />

The dmg will be the same in a easier way for people to manage it.</div></div><hr />

There is no reason not to agree. They already stated the squish has to happen one way or another.<br />

There is no reason to have to read numbers in the 100ks vs the 1ks. There is no logical reason for you to want big numbers there just isn't Besides I LIKE TO SEE BIG NUMBERS.<br />

they don't affect performance but a program can't work with numbers that exceed a certain limit... for 32bit programs it ranges from -2,147,483,647 to 2,147,483,647 or 0 to 4,294,967,295... not sure if WoW uses signed or unsigned integers or something else but if they used unsigned integers the max number they could reach is 4,294,967,295 ... and bosses will have much more HP than that next expansion.</div></div><hr />

I love this answer. &quot;Blizzard said it therefore it's true&quot;. I've worked with COBOL, Pascal (and sometimes (read rarely) I have to write pieces of code in Assembly) and Java so don't come here and call me ignorant when you refuse to think and ask questions.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's not, really. But that's 1s and 0s. 1+1 and 100000+100000 are simple enough that a child can do it. A raid of 25 each doing random numbers of damage (25,416+36,598+61,833+24,553.....) every second is a little more complicated than 1+1.<br />
<br />
Point is, they take exactly the same amount of time thus big numbers don't decrease performance, not even by 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001%.</div></div><hr />

There's nothing about &quot;1838 + 161% of spell power&quot; that requires a float. Floats are used in programming for really big numbers in situations where you are fine with losing decimal accuracy - simply put, they are stored as a base and an exponent, which means the bigger a number gets, the less accuracy you get in the least significant digits. The largest storeable single precision float is astronomically huge (something in the vicinity of 3.4 * 10^38) and has no relevance to this game.</div></div><hr />

Because most people with some basic knowledge about how computers calculate things knows that as long as you're within an integers boundaries, there is no (noticeable) difference in computing time.<br />
<br />
Sadly, it's a lot easier to fall into the &quot;logic&quot; that &quot;bigger numbers must mean longer calculation!&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't really care how high numbers are, what I do care about is soloing older content and I'd be delighted to know how they plan on keeping the balance, although 1-60 needs way less squishing than higher levels.<br />
You can't divide all numbers by 10, even though that's somehow a favorite argument in this debate. Okay, so my level 35 warrior will have 300 hp and my 90 paladin 70,000? Gee, that accomplished a lot.</div></div><hr />

They &quot;need&quot; to do the item squish because they can support bigger numbers only by going for solutions that involve more memory being consumed by EVERY NUMBER in wow, and/or making all users still playing on 32-bit computers or operating systems very unhappy.

<br />
PERSONAL OPINION: On the matter as a whole, I do think the number squish will be annoying and aggravating to me. I would much prefer they keep scaling numbers the way they have now (there's no difference in readability between 1k, 1m and 1b damage or health). As they said, they implemented it internally already but it &quot;felt wrong&quot;. I can accept that it's a passable solution to a very real problem they are facing but that doesn't make me happier about it.</div></div><hr />

Too many players play for larger numbers, even if the numbers are relatively the same strength in the world, they are still smaller and feel incorrect after playing so long with bigger numbers. Blizzard tested this on an internal build and said they won't do it because they felt it didn't feel right. Now they are saying they will. What the heck? If they felt it didn't feel right, why give into the public that hasn't tested it and thinks it would?<br />
<br />
It's not hard to do an number condense, making things easier to read but keeping the numbers the same. Reducing &quot;player stats&quot; is not the way to do it, people will feel weaker, relative or not. They simply need to start showing 1,430 as 1.43k, 1,320,000 as 1.32m, 1,758,495,596 as 1.75b, etc in damage/heals on the screen, skills, gear, etc. Just change how number are presented to the player, not the actual numbers themselves. There is no need to an item crush. This format will always make any number easily readable and will take much less development time. It will also not piss off the people that play FOR bigger numbers, many people treat the game like Diablo. Do they realize how pissed Diablo players would be if the numbers were reduced across the board?<br />
<br />
With 4 difficulties, and now a complete number change, they really are going out of their way to kill any immersion this game had.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't see how recalculating numbers take anything away from the art asset teams.<br />
<br />
So an art team is all that is required to not slow the game down? Typically in game development, the art team finishes their job way before any other team... Item squish would be a huge task to do correctly and not effect soloability. It would not be a simple recalculation, it would be a very long step by step process.</div></div><hr />

There are no floats in these calculations beyond implicit conversions used to get a rounded integer out of a division (not that that is in any way relevant to the current matter). They &quot;need&quot; to do the item squish because they can support bigger numbers only by going for solutions that involve more memory being consumed by EVERY NUMBER in wow, and/or making all users still playing on 32-bit computers or operating systems very unhappy. It's simply the most practical solution.<br />

I'm a programmer too. Just because you don't see a FIST instruction in your high level language when you are casting from float to int it doesn't mean you are not converting a float at the stack 8087.</div></div><hr />

Because most people with some basic knowledge about how computers calculate things knows that as long as you're within an integers boundaries, there is no (noticeable) difference in computing time.<br />
<br />
Sadly, it's a lot easier to fall into the &quot;logic&quot; that &quot;bigger numbers must mean longer calculation!&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't really care how high numbers are, what I do care about is soloing older content and I'd be delighted to know how they plan on keeping the balance, although 1-60 needs way less squishing than higher levels.<br />
You can't divide all numbers by 10, even though that's somehow a favorite argument in this debate. Okay, so my level 35 warrior will have 300 hp and my 90 paladin 70,000? Gee, that accomplished a lot.<br />
<br />
The interview never mentioned anything about performance, maybe you are replying to another poster?<br />
<br />
Bigger numbers does not mean longer calculation to the CPU, you are correct. Current CPUs large pipelines and architecture can crunch large numbers in little no problem.<br />
<br />
Someone mentioned float. Calculating floats however ARE slower than integers that's a fact, even though modern CPUs (GPUs particularly since floats appear most prominently in graphics) have made calculating floats much faster.<br />
<br />
And although you like to solo older content, that's not and never was part of Blizzard's design, nor they have come out and promised anything of the sort &quot;We support people soloing older content&quot;. It was a simply a side effect due to all the exponential scaling and Blizzard never coming around to fix that.</div></div><hr />

If it wasn't supported then why did they remove the group requirement to get inside raid zones? Why did they add pets to old raids? Why did they made it easier to solo bosses like the first guy in BWL and C'Thun?</div></div><hr />

<br />
And its not really that intensive. Programmers will have an easier and quicker time dealing with the smaller numbers in terms of output and feedback from their calculations and so shall we.<br />

<br />
It bothers me that Blizzard needs to waste time addressing all the tinfoil hat concerns about this. Who cares if it improves performance or not. Hell, who even cares if it affects old content - although they have stated too many times already that it will not. The squish is obviously ( and primarily ) about returning the numbers to a more manageable feeling level. <br />
<br />
And there is no right or wrong answer. Some people prefer numbers on par with original vanilla, while others are awed by big digits and want things to keep growing. It's just preference. For me, I prefer more reasonable numbers and I look forward to the squish.<br />
<br />
Ironically, I bet most of the people complaining about the squish ( and going back to vanilla type numbers ) are the same ones that always talk about how great vanilla was and that they want vanilla servers. I don't know this for sure, but I'd wager that it's the case. <br />
<br />
Bottom line: Get out of the face of the devs and let them do their thing. Babysitting the QQ's just uses resources that could be expended elsewhere. <br />
<br />
Bring it on ... squish it!</div></div><hr />

If Blizzard truely supported soloing old dungeons as a feature, they would have balanced the classes accordingly instead of only a few select classes/specs able to solo almost all content and other classes having almost no chance unless they outlevel it severely. Most transmog runs to 80/85 content are still done in groups.<br />

this isnt a HUGE nerf to damage while everything has impossible amounts of health. the ratio's of damage to health will remain the same as they are now (as well as the overwhelming level a lvl 90 will have on a lvl 80 dungeon boss) but the numbers on all sides will be tweaked lower .<br />
<br />
10k dps will be the new 547k, not just 10k dps as we see it now at lvl 90.<br />
<br />
It will be like calculating feet in kilometers instead<br />
<br />
instead of saying iam traveling 328084 feet, you'll say 100 KM</div></div><hr />

Item squish doesn't take away any of that. DnD (or at least the older editions) manages to keep the scaling very tight and no one complains there is no progression there, so I don't think any reason why WoW couldn't manage it.<br />

There is nothing stopping you from leveling one of said toons, also old content to them are the ones they tune to allow you to solo them, like bwl. It's also the ones they put pets into. They don't care if you can solo cata content.<br />

Every time I see WoW in a news article or a gaming article I always scroll down to the comments and it's always filled with, &quot;I quit that game cause of the stupid new talent system&quot; or &quot;They dumbed the game down too much&quot;. If you honestly believe casual players who don't go to the forums (Which is the majority) aren't going to freak out when the squish happens then I don't know what to tell you. I can't help your ignorance. The talent changes to me weren't that big of a deal, but I can see why many freaked and quit. The squish would be a bigger deal to a lot more players.</div></div><hr />

OT, I really miss those days of spamming in Westfall for a group to complete the quests in the northern towers with the elites....ANYONE ELSE???!!! These days everything is so simple. Everything is soloable (quests while leveling). Bring back some tough quests with good rewards while leveling. The rares in MOP kinda helped, but I miss group quests.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You will be able to get better gear by grinding out 535 pieces in the Timeless Isles than you will be able to running LFR. This looks like Blizzard's not so subtle attempt to get players running Flex raids instead of LFR to 'see' the content. I think that the number of LFR users will definitely drop if there is a non-raid alternative to get upgrades, and will massively drop once people may be down to a slot or two left to upgrade. Just as Blizzard seemed to try to artificially boost LFR usage by making it the only gearing path for alts and catch-up gearing in the first 3 patches, it seems like now they are reversing course and sabotaging its particiipation numbers by giving players a non-raid alternative to getting better gear, while at the same time boosting participating in their new feature 'flex' raiding. Manipulating game play through reward to prove that their latest feature is great, because they can then back it up with participation numbers, is a pretty slick trick. Players follow the gear, that is what drives the game, and Blizzard uses this to validate their changes. Don't get me wrong though, I think Flex is a great addition to the game, so for me this would be a fantastic shift in design.<br />
<br />
It begs the question tho &quot;Is this the beginning of the phasing out of LFR and a push towards Flex being the alternative raiding source in the next xpac?&quot;</div></div><hr />

What do you mean like Valor gear is 522 compared to LFR 502?<br />
<br />
People read so much into so many things (and some people get frustrated when the things they have made up don't happen).<br />
<br />
LFR is for randoms.<br />
<br />
Flex is for PUGs and Friends.<br />
<br />
Normals and Heroics are for Raiding guilds.<br />
<br />
Do I think this is to many levels of difficulty?<br />
<br />
Sure I can see that.<br />
<br />
But I think I would rather they merged Flex and Normals (and tuned Normals slight lower than say Horridon was) and keep LFR, than get rid of LFR.</div></div><hr />

And when the queue times start going up a lot of people will just say screw it, snowballing it even more. I'm all for the death of LFR, I feel it's ruining the game.

Disregarding a whole expansion of new features, leveling content, raiding content, etc for 1 systems change .. yeah you better quit now and save yourself the money<br />
<br />
You do know what a tipping point is right? Nobody quits this game because of one reason. It's usually a myriad of reasons and eventually one thing comes along and you just think yeah k I'm done now. I really doubt all the people they lost from the new talent system were perfectly happy with everything else in the game. That was just the tipping point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People read so much into so many things (and some people get frustrated when the things they have made up don't happen).<br />
<br />
LFR is for randoms.<br />
<br />
Flex is for PUGs and Friends.<br />
<br />
Normals and Heroics are for Raiding guilds.<br />
<br />
Do I think this is to many levels of difficulty?<br />
<br />
Sure I can see that.<br />
<br />
But I think I would rather they merged Flex and Normals (and tuned Normals slight lower than say Horridon was) and keep LFR, than get rid of LFR.<br />
<br />
I could care less if LFR exists, because I have quit running it. It'll be nice to have alternatives to grinding valor to get gear upgrades that aren't LFR, so I may dust of an alt or two in 5.4. I can promise that the only way I will ever use LFR again is if for some reason it becomes a place I can improve my main again. I hope that is not the case. It's existence is meaningless to me unless I'm lured in for character progression again. I think with the new gear levels in 5.4 that LFR participation will drop quite massively, especially if people find flex raiding managable and rediscover what it is to raid casually with friends as opposed to 24 random people, some of whom are usually rude idiots. I don't 'hope' for anything to happen, but I believe the game would be better right now if LFR wasn't forced down the throats of the player base.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe if the western market mass quits, maybe we will get some love too! Like buying premade lvl 90's for those who want to 'save time' lvling up and maybe we can buy a set of full pvp bop gear for those of us who want to 'save time' from farming honour. Hell maybe we can buy the full list of achiv's and HC gear to 'save time' from even playing this game!<br />
<br />
Seriously a massive joke how much more blizzard is a money hungry grabbing company as opposed to back in the old days.<br />
<br />
Well they have to make up for all of the subs they're losing in some way!</div></div><hr />

The engine that runs on the servers. This limits the servers to 4bil. The client uses Lua 5.1 for the UI and all mods. Lua uses float for all math and wouldn't have a problem going beyond the 4bil limit. But I think numbers are too big and would be in favor of the squish.</div></div><hr />

As for item squish, i like the big numbers only from the perpsected that it makes my char feel like its grown over the years, got more powerfull and what not.<br />
Nothing to do with epeen like someone mentioned before, not sure why they think epeen has anything to do with it when we all level to 90 the same :S<br />
As long as it doesnt fuck over low level grinding , for me i dont want it , it will take me a while to adjust back down again to it but yea whatever, get on with it i guess.<br />
<br />
i do actually think there will be some sub losses over this, some people will not like the squish simply because of what i put above, it feels like your char would be backpeddling. Most others that leave due to this will be the same old bandwagon riders most prob.</div></div><hr />

Also - buying your way out of dailies now? AWESOMELY NOT AWESOME. If this EVER gets put into the US/EU/etc servers I may just quit.<br />
<br />
Seriously...it's crappy enough that they've started putting &quot;cosmetic&quot; armour up for RL$; I seriously believe it's only a matter of time before they start letting players buy their way to success in WoW. They keep saying that they won't put direct character-stat-increasing items up to buy but for real - at least by some point the next expansion you'll be able to pay Blizzard for your gear upgrades to &quot;save your time&quot; coz you don't have time to play every day.</div></div><hr />

They will script it all about. The most is checking to see if it all works out balance wise.<br />

That's why they don't want to do it, it would be too much to adjust. They already took a few ideas from that game, why not some more.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tinykong</div><div class="date">2013-07-30, 07:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with the squish is that unless they switch to linear scaling (say, 10 ilvls per &quot;tier&quot;) it's just going to keep happening.<br />
<br />
If it scales exponentially, say in 6.0 launch raids everyone is at 100 ilvl. In 6.4, everyone is at 200 ilvl. That's like going from 489 in MSV to 978 in siege. The power scaling will still be absurd, and unless they continually readjust these levels every expansion, it will just spiral out of control again. That's just how exponential growth works.<br />
<br />
If it scales linearly, then those same people at launch would be at 100 ilvl, and then be at 140ilvl in 6.4. Imagine how cool it's going to feel to replace an item from the previous raid tier and get 9 intellect! Or 15 mastery! HELL YES.<br />
<br />
Mega damage solves the problems without the perceived nerf to player power. If they reduce everyone down to TBC damage levels, people will quit the game. Certainly not everyone, but some. Can they really risk that?<br />
<br />
Seeing a fireball hit for 503k at level 95 and having a tooltip with 12.3k Mastery is a lot more interesting than being 580 ilvl in Siege and doing 250k dps, 6.0.4 dropping and suddenly doing 2500 dps. Not to mention the goofy stuff that is bound to happen because encounters are tuned with an expected player power proportionate to level for a given tier.<br />
<br />
Even if it's not a player power nerf, it will be perceived as one.</div></div><hr />

The only thing that's changed is the numbers. Your place in the world and what your character can accomplish have not changed one bit.<br />
<br />
Imagine I came from somewhere that uses a currency with big numbers like the Czech Republic. Say I went to the UK and got my money changed to £'s instead. Do I feel poorer because I have 100's of pounds rather than 1000's of koruna in my wallet? No, of course not. I still have the same amount of money just in a more concentrated number. Imagine I buy a pint of Guinness. The numbers have changed but the beer, what I paid for it and the enjoyment I get out of it have remained EXACTLY THE SAME. I don't feel like I'm any less wealthy because everything around me has adjusted to be the same.</div></div><hr />
