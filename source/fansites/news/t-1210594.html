Patch 5.1: Wrathion Quest Line<br />
The last thing we heard (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/31483-incoming) from Wrathion were his instructions to await the fleet's arrival in Patch 5.1. After meeting the scout (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/32249-meet-the-scout), and clearing the way (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/32250-the-might-of-the-warchief), the fleet will arrive (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/32108-domination-point). <br />
<br />
You can then visit Wrathion again, who wants to learn more about Varian (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/32373-the-measure-of-a-leader). You must then prove that your faction should win the war (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/32374-the-princes-pursuit) by earning Revered with him, which is done by killing forces of the opposing faction in Krasarang Wilds. There are some side quests along the way, such as winning 10 battlegrounds (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/32389-the-lion-roars) or taking a group to kill a general (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/32388-a-change-of-command).<br />
<br />
After you are revered, Wrathion will call you back (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/32390-call-of-the-packmaster) to tell you what he has learned about Varian. This is seemingly where the quest line stops for now. It may be incomplete, as the Horde side of the quest line is not even added yet. <br />
<br />
That isn't all Wrathion is doing in this patch however. Warlocks can obtain a Sealed Tome of the Lost Legion (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/92426) that is sealed. After binding it to you (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/133806-unlock-tome) and consulting with one of your demons (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/32295-an-unusual-tome), you can take it to a Warlock trainer (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/32307-reader-for-the-dead-tongue) to find out more about it.<br />
<br />
You then visit Wrathion, who asks you (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/32309-a-tale-of-six-masters) to read Legacy of the Masters (Part 1) (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/83078-legacy-of-the-masters-part-1#c1;related:comments). You are then sent to General Nazgrim (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/32311-enlistment-orders) / Admiral Taylor (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/32312-enlistment-orders) to let him know that you are going to try and recruit The Council of the Black Harvest (http://www.wowpedia.org/Council_of_the_Black_Harvest) to aid in the fight against the Alliance / Horde. <br />
<br />
Next, you infiltrate (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/32313-hunt-helheim) the opposite faction's base to obtain the second part of Legacy of the Masters. You retrieve Jubeka's Journal (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/92471) from them, which has clues as to the location of four Soulstone fragments (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/32317-seeking-the-soulstones) that contain memories. Once you have collected them all, you combine them and follow the source (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/32324-seek-the-signal) of the power to the Black Temple. <br />
<br />
You then follow Kanrethad and Jubeka's trail (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/32325-infiltrating-the-black-temple) to the top of the Black Temple. While on your way there, Akama will make another appearance in the area where you fought Bloodboil. He is under attack by forces you unleashed in the Reliquary of Souls, so you assist him (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/32341-demonstrate-your-power) and then make your way (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/32340-plunder-the-black-temple) to the summit. <br />
<br />
Once there, something happens that creates The Eye of the Storm (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/92563). You then return to Wrathion (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/32359-the-eye-of-the-naaru) to try and find out what it is. He doesn't know anything about it, but is willing to ask his agents. They are busy with the Horde and Alliance war, so you will have to wait until Patch 5.2 (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/32360-awaiting-the-black-harvest) to find out what happens next!<br />

Envy (http://www.envy.si) and Vodka (http://www.vodka-guild.net/) picked up Second and Third place on the 25 man leaderboard (http://www.wowprogress.com/rating.tier14_25).<br />

Patch 5.1 Quests<br />
Patch 5.1 brings us two new factions, Operation: Shieldwall (http://www.wowdb.com/factions/1376) for the Alliance and Dominance Offensive (http://www.wowdb.com/factions/1375) for the Horde. These factions are part of the group that has arrived in Pandaria and is fighting in Krasarang Wilds, They offer daily quests, but the main storyline is advanced as well. You can find a list of all of the new lists on the WoWDB PTR Site (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests?filter-patch=16139).<br />
<br />
Read through the Horde quest text to find out what happens to Vol'jin, why Thrall has reappeared, what Garrosh is up to, what the Horde steals from Darnassus, what Lor'themar Theron is working on, what Aethas Sunreaver is doing, and the fate of the Sunreavers in Dalaran after Jaina has made a decision. <br />
<br />
The Alliance questline isn't finished, as noted in the Official Patch notes (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2961-Patch-5-1-on-PTR-Official-Patch-Notes), but you still get a glimpse of where Varian is, what Brann Bronzebeard is up to, and what Anduin is doing.<br />

Druid: Heart of the Wild Changes<br />
While we aren’t always able to provide advance warning when an ability changes, there’s still some time before this change goes into effect, and we wanted to offer affected players a chance to plan their strategies appropriately in the meantime. <br />
<br />
The following changes are currently planned for retuning the Druid talent, Heart of the Wild:<br />
<br />
The spell damage bonus that Heart of the Wild (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/108288-heart-of-the-wild) provides to Feral and Guardian Druids will soon be reduced from +500% to +320%. The agility bonus that Heart of the Wild (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/108288-heart-of-the-wild) provides to Balance, Restoration, and Guardian Druids in Cat Form will soon be changed to +110%. It was previously +50% for Guardian Druids, and +200% for Balance and Restoration Druids.<br />
<br />
Currently, the change is expected to go into effect during next Tuesday’s maintenance.<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 5.0.5 Hotfixes - October 12<br />
General<br />
<br />
Ink traders no longer accept Blackfallow Ink (http://www.wowdb.com/items/61978). They now accept Ink of Dreams (http://www.wowdb.com/items/79254), and Starlight Ink (http://www.wowdb.com/items/79255) has become available for purchase.<br />
The Windsong and Elemental Force weapon enchantments can now be activated by periodic effects.<br />
The Sha of Anger's (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/60491) respawn time has been greatly reduced.<br />
Fishing in Shipwreck Debris is now more rewarding and will no longer sometimes provide an empty box.<br />
Ancient Guo-Lai Caches (http://www.wowdb.com/objects/214388) can now be found in more varied locations within the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.<br />

<br />
Death Strike (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/49998) now deals 7.5% less damage.<br />
Death Siphon (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/108196) base damage has been increased by 50%, but it now scales less efficiently with attack power. This should result in an increase in damage for Frost and Unholy Death Knights, and a minor reduction in damage for Blood Death Knights benefitting from Vengeance.<br />
Blood<br />
<br />
Rune Strike (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/56815) now deals 8.5% less damage.<br />
Heart Strike (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/55050) now deals 8.5% less damage.<br />

<br />
Paladins are now granted the following effects from Symbiosis based on talent specialization:<br />
<br />
Protection - Rebirth (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/113269)<br />
Holy - Rebirth (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/113269)<br />

<br />
Aimed Shot (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/19434) now deals 320% weapon damage (up from 280%), but the base damage component has been reduced by 65%. The damage that this ability does at level 90 should remain relatively unchanged.<br />
Healing performed by Spirit Beasts summoned by the Stampede talent is now correctly reduced by 75%.<br />
Rabid (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/53401) has been changed and now increases a pet's attack speed by 70%. Pet attack power is now unaffected by this ability.<br />
Deterrence (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/19263) now correctly prevents the use of all three level 75 Hunter talents. Previously, Lynx Rush could still be used.<br />
The root provided by Narrow Escape (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/109298) now correctly breaks on damage in a manner similar to other rooting effects.<br />

Pet Battles Hotfixes<br />
As you can see by the following updates, we're still keeping a very close eye on Pet Battles. You guys have been fantastic with your continued updates and we sincerely appreciate that, and your patience. Please keep in mind, due to the nature of these types of fixes, they very likely won't be active until after next week's standard maintenance has concluded. Here are the things we are hotfixing:<br />
<br />
<br />
Battle Pet Training is now correctly shared account wide to all characters.<br />
Numerous pet battle achievements should now reward correctly:<br />
Taming the World has been reduced to 40 pet tamers from 45. The achievement should now properly reward to players that earned it before or after the hotfix.<br />
Taming achievements should now reward correctly. Many players reported the criteria completed but the achievement would not complete.<br />
Taming achievements rewarding correctly should also alleviate the problem with daily quests not activating correctly. The daily quests are unlocked based on the Taming achievements being completed.<br />
Strong and Pristine traps should now correctly be rewarded to players from achievements. This fix should retroactively award the traps to players that already have the achievements.<br />
Purchasable pets have been removed from the Eastern Kingdoms Safari achievement.<br />
An issue with account daily quests not resetting has been fixed.<br />
Note that many of the achievement fixes will show incorrect UI until patch 5.1.0. Rest assured that the data is correctly working though.<br />
An issue with phased pets in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms has been fixed.<br />
<br />

Daily Quests and Burnout<br />
Previously we were placing limits on dailies and what you were able to accomplish, regardless of what you wanted to do or had time to do. Now, removing the daily quest cap and adding a ton of dailies is really us taking the lid off the cookie jar. You could potentially get an icky tummy if you're trying to eat all of them every day. But we think that's a decision each player can make for themselves. Some people are going to feel like they're missing out or falling behind if they don't do absolutely everything every day, and that's something everyone should evaluate and decide for themselves if that's what they can and want to do.<br />
<br />
Personally I'm working on a couple factions at a time. They're not providing items that will make or break my ability to play, enjoy and advance in the game, and the expansion is going to be out a while. I have time to work on the others later.<br />
<br />
The problem here Bashiok is that for your hardcore progression raiders, unlocking all the valor gear feels like a requirement, not a thing we can do when we feel like it. Between that and trying to maximize tillers so I can have mats for 300 stat food (which again, a lot of guilds are requiring from their raiders), WoW is monopolizing all of my gaming time. I get that you guys want to make sure the casual players don't get bored, but in the process of doing so you've basically forced the hardcore progression raiders to -have- to play all the time.<br />
For a hardcore progression raider, I don't think it's unreasonable that additional time and requirements are needed to be a hardcore progression raider.

Sha of Anger Respawn Time<br />
his respawn is around 2min?<br />
No, it shouldn't be lower than 10 minutes.<br />

We did reduce the respawn timer of Sha of Anger a bit further very recently, it's not on a fixed timer though, so we get to keep some of the unpredictability.

<br />
Cooking Materials and Bag Space<br />
We agree that some storage space is needed for cooking materials. Our plan was to implement a bag for these items in patch 5.1, but we don't know if that's the best solution. It's difficult to justify giving up a bag slot for a bag that only holds profession-specific items unless you have a large quantity. After some recent discussion, we're now exploring options to develop something similar to Void Storage where you can store your cooking materials. A Pantry, if you will.<br />
<br />
We'll definitely keep you posted when we have more information to share.<br />
<br />
D'oh, I just noticed what I posted could be misleading. Allow me to clarify things a bit better: We do intend to include new cooking bags with patch 5.1, but we're certainly not done exploring better and more efficient ways to handle your cooking storage needs. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/239990-suggestion-for-cooking-bag/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6794033470?page=2#31))<br />
<br />
Daily Quests Requirement<br />
So I just hit 90 and the general consensus I've been hearing is that you &quot;HAVE&quot; to do dailies in order to gear up. From the research I've done, I disagree.<br />
<br />
Epics from each faction's quartermasters are iLvl 489. The Mogu'shan Vaults normal difficulty offers iLvl 489 gear. Heart of Fear normal offers iLvl 496. From what I'm seeing, there are no necessary enchants from these vendors like there were from say, Sons of Hodir in WOTLK.<br />
This is correct. You don't need to do dailies to get the gear you need to go into dungeons or Raid. I've known of many people now who geared up without doing this (successfully and quickly). There are a variety of ways to get gear beyond the dailies including crafting and dungeon runs themselves. <br />
<br />
Most of the items that you can get from the dailies are either available at a lower (read not exalted) reputation or are just not necessary and are more cosmetic or fun items. Just doing the normal quests through the zones can also get you easily into Heroic dungeons and on. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/239897-why-do-people-think-dailies-are-required/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6794643293?page=3#41))<br />

Realm Restarts<br />
Could we get a quick explanation on why the servers need to be restart nearly every day? Especially since you find it prudent to &quot;schedule&quot; those restarts in the middle of the day.<br />
<br />
We do restarts for a variety of reasons. In most cases, we are doing it to have the live realms pick up hotfixes that have been applied. We try to schedule these so they have the least possible impact on players, but we have a lot of time zones to account for, so one person's middle of the day is another's early morning or even late night. No matter when we do it, we're going to impact someone. So, we try to minimize the amount of time that impact has and the time of day both. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/239899-restarts/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6794983494?page=2#33))<br />
<br />
LFR Difficulty<br />
This subject has been discussed extensively on other threads, setting the perfect difficulty level for LFR is a very tricky thing to accomplish.<br />
<br />
When you enter a LFR raid you never know what will be the average skill level of those 25 players, good communication is usually very hard to accomplish, there’s always players not listening, there might be more than 1 person trying to lead, different tactics might become conflicting, etc…<br />
<br />
There are just too many things we have to take into account; you just can’t expect LFR to have a linear decrease in difficulty from Normal mode.<br />
<br />
For example, if you get 25 experienced (in normal mode) skilled players that don’t know each other joined together by LFR, they won’t have the same raiding experience as if they were raiding with their own guild groups, even though they are able to complete raids in normal mode with their own guilds, they might end up taking a very long time to adjust to each other and face several wipes if LFR had the same difficulty as normal mode.<br />
<br />
What I’m saying is, if we raise the difficulty too much, due to the nature of the random grouping system, most raids will end up with excessive wipes, players frequently leaving, constant queuing to find replacements, and just an overall bad and tedious experience. Sure, every once in a blue moon, the right group of players would be put together and would have a great raid, but if that happens only 1 out of 10 times that’s not something we aim for with LFR, it wasn’t designed to appeal to those players, for that you have normal and heroic mode.<br />
<br />
The raid encounters need to take into account not only the skill level of the average raid but also the fact that these raids are usually made up of players that don’t know each other and the inevitable lack of communication and coordination that it implies. <br />
Certain Boss abilities on normal mode are built around the assumption that there’s enough coordination in those raid groups to overcome certain obstacles. This same assumption can’t be applied to LFR, that’s why sometimes we have to simply remove certain Boss abilities instead of just tuning them down, some abilities can only be either on or off, without anything that you can actually scale up or down.<br />
<br />
I realize that these first LFR encounters might feel a bit too easy to some of you, but I think that the explanation for that also lies within that very same sentence; they’re the “first bosses” of the “first part” of LFR. <br />
Let’s wait and see how the difficulty of LFR encounters progresses in the near future, if the overall feeling of the community is that the difficulty needs to be raised, we’ll make sure to pass that info along to the developers and if they happen to feel the same way about it, I’m sure they’ll be happy to adjust it. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/239858-lfr-difficulty-are-you-serious/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/5616172317?page=5#89))<br />
<br />
Stat Scaling in Challenge Modes<br />
Maybe take hit out of the equation altogether by either giving players a challenge mode buff that awards the hit cap one its own and just remove peoples hit from gear from their stats for the duration? Or modify the enemies so that special attacks can never miss enemies in challenge modes at all? After all most people are going to be hit capped for normal stuff by the time they do challenge modes.<br />
The debate over hit as a compelling stat is a whole topic unto itself.<br />
<br />
Under the current formula though, I don't think the solution is to make hit irrelevant in Challenge Modes. To min/max your character (which you need to do if you want to be really competitive), you'd want a full set of &quot;no-hit&quot; gear. It'd create a very different itemization problem, given that hit is factored into endgame set stat budgets.<br />
<br />
Challenge modes should just normalize all our stats pertaining to our class. This would mean every player of that class would have the same stat sheet regardless of what they are wearing. Scaling always struck me as gimmicky and open to various glitches that would need to be looked at.<br />
That doesn't feel as interesting. We scale the stats so you can't just straight up outgear Challenge Mode, but we still want you to have some ability to build an ideal set of gear based on the stats you choose.<br />
<br />
The whole idea is to prevent outgearing while still making gear selection matter. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/239658-im-losing-hit-chance-in-challenge-modes/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6794350670?page=3#48))<br />
<br />
Valor Points Buff on Alt Characers<br />
The buff that makes you get 50% more valor points applies to all characters on the realm you're playing as long as one character in that realm hits the 1000 valor points weekly cap. Since that cap resets on Wednesdays, it's normal that it's no longer there. It'll be reapplied to your character as soon as you hit the 1000 valor weekly cap again.<br />
<br />
In short, the Valor of the Ancients (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/130609) buff is meant to help your other characters on that same realm to get to the valor cap quickly.

Darkmoon Ox Deck Hotfix<br />
I’m glad this trinket got a buff, however honestly Nethaera it should never had needed a buff as internally you guys should have done a better job at making sure its stat weighting reflected its item level.<br />
<br />
We'll pass along the feedback, just keep in mind that what may seem simple at first glance rarely ever is as it seems. I've said this many times over the years, but there are many moving parts for the developers and engineers to consider and a &quot;simple&quot; change (as you're all well aware) can create a domino effect. Unfortunately, we don't always catch everything, and sometimes after a major patch or new content is added, we still have more work to do to &quot;fix&quot; anything that might seem just a bit off, or not as it probably should be. The thing that should help some (even if it's sometimes inconvenient) is that we don't just call things good and forget about them. It may take a bit to identify an issue or to get to something, but that doesn't mean anyone rests on their laurels. <br />
<br />
This is a living breathing game and we have to treat it as such. The important thing for everyone to remember is constructive feedback does help a lot, and that change is going to happen regularly (small or large) so it's important to be a bit adaptable to those changes as they go. That doesn't mean to accept everything as it is all the time, it just means being able to identify the things that matter to you most and let the smaller things not bother you as much.<br />
<br />
Again, all the feedback has been appreciated. Thank you everyone. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/239571-please-buff-ox-deck-thank-you/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6794031808?page=2#39))<br />
<br />
Lack of Bag Space<br />
We feel your pain, but as the developers see it, simply making more bag space available won't resolve inflating inventory issues—in the long term at least. We'd like to look at other solutions for addressing the issue of an ever-growing inventory. <br />

PvP Feedback<br />
What exactly makes you think that the Arena and Rated Battlegrounds forum is ignored? Just because there are no posts made about a particular topic does not mean that we are not actively looking into player feedback, what is happening in the community and the game itself.<br />

No Hotfixes<br />
Just because you cannot see the hotfixes happening doesn't mean that they are not occurring, there are bug fixes and tweaks happening constantly.<br />
<br />
No intention of Balancing PvP<br />
What brings you to this conclusion? The PvP season has been running for a very short period thus far and with everyone still not reaching their full potential with the new skills and gameplay as well as gear, it is hard to determine the exact nature of balance right now. The developers are closely watching the PvP scene though and will make changes if they deem it necessary.

Gara'jal the Spiritbinder Feedback<br />
This encounter is definitely one of the more challenging boss fights you can face, and after reading some of your feedback, we wanted to follow up with you about a few things:<br />
<br />
<br />
The spawn rate of the phased adds on 10-player Heroic mode is slower than 25-player Heroic mode. As a matter of fact, the spawn rate is slower on 10-player Heroic mode than it is on 25-player Normal mode. We are not currently aware of any non-cosmetic bugs with the Gara'jal encounter. If you feel this is incorrect, please be sure to follow-up with all the details. It is possible that when many Shadowy Minions are active, there may be a higher likelihood of large bursts of damage on 10-player Heroic mode than there is on 25-player. This is something we're currently evaluating and may adjust, without reducing the overall damage output of the minions. No hotfixes or changes to this encounter have been applied to the game since Tuesday night. In a general sense, we avoid making significant tuning adjustments to encounters (other than exploit fixes or major bugfixes) until after a raid week has concluded. This is the fairest approach for all players that avoids diminishing any current accomplishments, or exacerbating any current struggles.<br />

What's with this? Forgotten Treasures are for a level 71 quest.<br />

That's apparently a huge space hog, and would be counter-productive to the reason they took out the key-ring. Everyone with a tiny bit of unnecessary bag slots takes up a lot of space.</div></div><hr />

The soulcore has transformed into a crystal. This is clearly the artifact that Kanrethad and Jubeka were attempting to create, but you still have no idea where they went.<br />

Considering your PC has no idea what it is they may assume they made the Crystal that appears. The fact that it's a part of a Naaru and bears the name of one of the Crystals kinda gives it away that maybe they were trying to do something with it considering each of the crystals had their own powers and uses.</div></div><hr />

Considering that the tome is an epic item and that the questline is flagged as a warlock questline, not a legendary questline, I'm gonna say no, probably not.<br />

<br />
<br />

You are mistaken. The warlock questline is not part of the Legendary chain, nor is it flagged as a Legendary questline.<br />
<br />
I suggest reading the news article more closely.<br />
<br />
The continuation of the Legendary questline is focused on the Horde/Alliance conflict and building reputation with Wrathion up to Revered. It is also not fully implemented at this time.</div></div><hr />

I have a feeling it won't be forcing you into PvP. Much like in Grizzly Hills back in the day, there was a daily quest to kill 10 horde. In that quest you could either kill enemy players OR kill horde npcs. I figure it'll be much the same here, and there will probably be a spot to grind horde npcs. However, you have to be careful because that will likely autoflag you on a PvE server, and there will probably be horde running around killing alliance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
wrong, they do it because a small vocal majority believes it's harder to do 25. It's not harder because you still only control 1 character in the raid, the bosses abilities is the same, you need to do the same dmg. <br />
<br />
One thing I may agree on that for less hardcore guilds it's harder with 25 because you usually fill up the raids with 15 nabs just do the content, but for the top 10 or even 20 guilds it doesn't matter if it's 10 or 25 because it will just as &quot;easy&quot; for them in either setup due to only having world class players who will know their role pretty quickly, only thing that set top guilds back is gear requirements to push the dps (lich king hc huge example).</div></div><hr />

I treated it like it was my child and put so much effort into it, the members loved it but then I started to keep changing it (making unnecessary changes) like changing something and then changing it again and then going back and what ever. now what the members really wanted was -&gt; content &lt;- . the forum was already perfectly (mostly) layed out and had great forum software. the thing it was lacking was content and over time changes kept been made and then reverted and whatever but that was just useless and made the members not like it was much. they wanted new and more content, not changes. the classes in wow are already fine really but in my opinion as of now over 7 years it needs to be updated and more content. not changes made to classes. instead of putting the effort and attention to changing classes,etc -&gt; focus on new content. World of Warcraft in my opinion is already awesome because:<br />
- The World, the way everything is layed out, etc<br />
- The music (perfect for each zone,etc)<br />
- Elwynn Forest -&gt; Goldshire (the way its layed out).<br />
- The light/-&gt; Brightish. It gives a nice fresh feeling and why I loved and played WoW. <br />
- The textures,art,etc (but the textures quality seems to be very low, wish it is higher quality) -&gt; makes a big difference<br />
- It runs smooth, zooming in and out even &lt;- all that makes a huge difference. I went to play Aion and the zooming in and out from your alt was a nightmare, it was just not that fun.<br />
- The animations -&gt; Best animations ever in any game, runs/looks/feels so smooth. WoW overall just feels and runs so smooth and that is another reason why I'm tempted to go back and play it. <br />
- The art,the design,the scale,etc,<br />
- Players levels,etc (80,31,etc)<br />
- The style and the type of the game. (The medieval bit makes wow in my opinion). whatever it is its just great.<br />
- etc..</div></div><hr />

<br />
lore wise is still pretty lol, especially if they do kill the prince... as velen in the short stories spread all over blizzards websites in the &quot;getting to know your leader&quot; segment (i still have no idea who the blood elf dude is) velen saw anduin as a paladin in the future.<br />
<br />
meh...a prince who goes to a faraway land to save his people and ignores his fathers pleas to come home. it's been done.<br />
<br />
<br />
much like the dungeons they're remaking. stale. just stale.<br />
<br />
<br />
least the new zones are pretty. shame about the quests, the bugs (oh the bugs) and the feeling of rep grinds that feel WORSE than vanilla, least in vanilla you got quests AND rep from mobs you killed. In MoP it's just daily quests on daily quests giving so low a rep.. i wonder if it's worth it.<br />
<br />
Look at the sword offered by the kaxxi at exalted, pfffft .. i'm halfway through revered and have a better weapon than that !</div></div><hr />
