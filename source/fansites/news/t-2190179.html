weaponGet Your Artifact Weapon to at Least 35 Traits<br />
Patch 7.2 introduces reworks to the existing Artifact Weapon system: <br />
<br />
Once you’ve earned 35 traits in your Artifact Weapons, you’ll be eligible for a new questline to empower your weapon.<br />
Once completed, you'll be able to spend Artifact Power on new Empowered traits (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/artifact-traits?filter-patch=23436), new ranks for existing traits, and a new Infinite trait (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/239042-concordance-of-the-legionfall?artifactRank=1), which features 50 ranks.<br />
Players who have put Artifact Power into their weapons beyond 35 traits will have all of this AP refunded and be able to allocate it to new traits.<br />
Previously earned Artifact Power items will not be usable on the empowered Artifact Weapon, so don't stockpile your AP tokens.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;hr&gt;<br />
knowledgeCap Your Artifact Knowledge<br />
<br />
Be sure that your artifact knowledge is maxed out.<br />
If you’re researching on an alt character, you can purchase Artifact Research Compendiums (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-search=Compendium&amp;filter-quality=64) on your main to speed things along.<br />
Make sure to hold on to enough Order Resources (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1220-order-resources) for class hall upgrades. <br />
You can see the new Artifact Knowledge multipliers here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6377-Patch-7-2-PTR-Build-23657#newak).<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;hr&gt;<br />
orderComplete Order Hall Class Campaign<br />
<br />
To continue with your order hall campaign in 7.2, you must have completed all currently available order hall quests.<br />
In 7.2, players can earn a new champion, class-specific achievements, and the achievement Champions of Legionfall (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/11846-champions-of-legionfall), which is required for Broken Isles Pathfinder, Part Two (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/11446-broken-isles-pathfinder-part-two).<br />
Completion of the order hall class campaign awards your class-specific flying mount. You can check them out here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6265-Patch-7-2-PTR-Build-23436-Class-Mount-Models).<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;hr&gt;<br />
upgradesCollect 25,000 Order Resources for New Order Hall Research<br />
<br />
If you haven’t already been stockpiling Order Resources (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1220-order-resources), you’ll want to start farming in order to purchase the two new order hall upgrades.<br />
The first upgrade (tier 7) costs 10,000 x Order Resources (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1220-order-resources) and takes one day to research.<br />
The second (tier 8) costs 15,000 x Order Resources (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1220-order-resources) and research completion will take 5 days.<br />
You’ll also need Order Resources (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1220-order-resources) for purchasing new artifact knowledge ranks (which now caps at 40).<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;hr&gt;<br />
flyingEarn the Broken Isles Pathfinder, Part One Achievement<br />
<br />
Complete the first Broken Isles Pathfinder achievement so you can work towards Broken Isles Pathfinder, Part Two once the patch is live.<br />
<br />
<br />
As a recap, here’s what you’ll need to do to earn that first achievement:<br />
<br />
Broken Isles Explorer (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/11188-broken-isles-explorer) - Explore the regions of the Broken Isles<br />
Variety is the Spice of Life (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/11189-variety-is-the-spice-of-life) - Complete 100 different world quests<br />
A Glorious Campaign (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/10994-a-glorious-campaign) - Complete your class order hall campaign<br />
Loremaster of Legion (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/11157-loremaster-of-legion) - Requires completion of all Legion zone achievements.<br />
<br />
Good Suramaritan will be the most time consuming achievement (though no longer gated) and is the only one which requires a boss kill, Xavius in Emerald Nightmare for The Emerald Nightmare: The Stuff of Dreams. This quest can be completed on any raid difficulty (including LFR).<br />
<br />
Broken Isles Diplomat (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/10672-broken-isles-diplomat) <br />
<br />
Earn Revered with The Wardens (http://ptr.wowdb.com/factions/1894-the-wardens), Court of Farondis (http://ptr.wowdb.com/factions/1900-court-of-farondis), The Dreamweavers (http://ptr.wowdb.com/factions/1883-dreamweavers), Highmountain Tribe (http://ptr.wowdb.com/factions/1828-highmountain-tribe), The Nightfallen (http://ptr.wowdb.com/factions/1859-the-nightfallen) and The Valarjar (http://ptr.wowdb.com/factions/1948-valarjar)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
repMax Reputations to Exalted for the Paragon System<br />
<br />
You're now able to keep earning reputation with a faction even after reaching Exalted.<br />
For each 20,000 reputation earned past Exalted, you will earn a supply reward similar to those awarded by Emissary Quests.<br />
These supply rewards have a chance to drop new, faction-exclusive mounts and toys.<br />
After earning 10 of these rewards, you’ll earn the achievement Paragon of the Broken Isles (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/11653-paragon-of-the-broken-isles).<br />
You won’t be able to gain reputation from insignias earned from world quests, so there’s no point in holding onto those.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here are the reward items you’ll have a chance to receive:<br />
<br />
Cloudwing Hippogryph (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/147806-cloudwing-hippogryph) from Farondis Chest (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/146897-farondis-chest)<br />
Highmountain Elderhorn (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/242874-highmountain-elderhorn) from Highmountain Supplies (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/146899-highmountain-supplies)<br />
Leywoven Flying Carpet (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/233364-leywoven-flying-carpet)from Nightfallen Cache (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/146900-nightfallen-cache)<br />
Sira’s Extra Cloak (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/147843-siras-extra-cloak) from Warden Supply Kit (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/146902-wardens-supply-kit)<br />

Wild Dreamrunner (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/242875-wild-dreamrunner) from Dreamweaver Cache (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/146898-dreamweaver-cache)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
championsLevel Class Hall Champions<br />
<br />
Level all Class Hall Champions to 110 and cap their item level.<br />
All Champions will now be able to reach Legendary quality, which unlocks a third equipment slot.<br />
Once Legendary, Champions will not be able to earn any more experience.<br />
You’ll be able to have one more active Champion, so make sure you have six Champions ready for missions.<br />
Don’t forget that you can take Combat Ally Champions with you on world quests.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
matsGather Materials for New Crafted BoE Legendary Items<br />
<br />
The first crafted item level 940 Legendary items have been added.<br />
These four items are Bind on Equipped and can be sold on the Auction House.<br />
The new Legendary items (and their required materials) are as follows:<br />
<br />
Celumbra, the Night's Dichotomy (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/146666-celumbra-the-nights-dichotomy): Bolt of Shadowcloth (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/146710-bolt-of-shadowcloth), Bolt of Starweave (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/146711-bolt-of-starweave), Nethershard Essence (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/146659-nethershard-essence), 65 x Blood of Sargeras (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/43534-blood-of-sargeras), 125 x Imbued Silkweave (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/127004-imbued-silkweave), Sharp Spritethorn (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/127681-sharp-spritethorn), Runic Catgut (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/127037-runic-catgut)<br />
Rethu's Incessant Courage (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/146667-rethus-incessant-courage): Hammer of Forgotten Heroes (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/146714-hammer-of-forgotten-heroes), Nethershard Essence (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/146659-nethershard-essence), 65 x Blood of Sargeras (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/43534-blood-of-sargeras), 125 x Demonsteel Bar (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/124461-demonsteel-bar)<br />
The Sentinel's Eternal Refuge (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/146669-the-sentinels-eternal-refuge): Wisp-Touched Elderhide (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/146712-wisp-touched-elderhide), Nethershard Essence (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/146659-nethershard-essence), 65 x Blood of Sargeras (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/43534-blood-of-sargeras), 250 x Stonehide Leather (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/124113-stonehide-leather)<br />
Vigilance Perch (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/146668-vigilance-perch): Prime Wardenscale (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/146713-prime-wardenscale), Nethershard Essence (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/146659-nethershard-essence), 65 x Blood of Sargeras (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/43534-blood-of-sargeras), 250 x Stormscale (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/124115-stormscale)<br />
<br />
<br />
Not all of these items will be available prior to the patch, as many special new reagents have been added solely for these crafting specific items.<br />
These legendary crafting materials are obtained through new quest chains.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
sellSell Excess Gathered Materials Before Flying is Unlocked<br />
<br />
Now that players will be able to fly, farming gathered materials such as herbs and minerals should be considerably easier than before.<br />
Because of this, Auction House prices will likely fluctuate.<br />
Consider selling any unneeded, stockpiled materials.<br />
Hold onto materials that are used in crafting 7.2’s new BoE legendaries, including Stonehide Leather (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/124113-stonehide-leather), Stormscale (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/124115-stormscale), Felslate (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/123919-felslate)and Leystone Ore (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/123918-leystone-ore)for Demonsteel Bar (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/124461-demonsteel-bar), and Shal’dorei Silk (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/124437-shaldorei-silk)for Imbued Silkweave (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/127004-imbued-silkweave).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
petsLevel Battle Pets<br />
<br />
Patch 7.2 introduces the first Pet Battle Dungeon, Wailing Critters (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/45423-wailing-critters).<br />
You’ll need to be level 110 and have one level 25 pet for the one-time scenario, but it's ideal to have three level 25 pets.<br />
You’ll need 15 max level pets for the Pet Battle Challenge: Wailing Caverns (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/45539-pet-battle-challenge-wailing-caverns)weekly scenario.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
transmogCollect Transmog Items<br />
<br />
Patch 7.2 adds a new “Sets” tab to the Appearances interface, so you can browse all item sets available to your character and see which items you are missing.<br />
The interface will tell you where to get the items, so you can complete missing sets.<br />
New achievements, such as Mogg-Saron (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/11751-mogg-saron) and Sha of Fabulous (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/11757-sha-of-fabulous), have been added for collecting PVE and PVP item sets.<br />
Earning 10 of these achievements will earn you the character title, “Stylist (http://ptr.wowdb.com/titles/505-stylist),” awarded by Azeroth’s Next Top Model (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/11761-azeroths-next-top-model).<br />

http://blue.mmo-champion.com/public/style_images/master/tracker/flags/us-en.png Estimated US Rating Cutoffs for Legion Season 2<br />
Over the last few PvP seasons, we’ve seen an increased request from the community for Blizzard to publish projected estimates of how much PvP rating a character will need in order to be awarded a title. We’ve been discussing the idea, and would like to give it a try.<br />
<br />
IMPORTANT: What follows is purely an estimation based on current ladder rankings and participation. The final cutoffs will only be determined once Legion Season 2 has actually concluded, and have the potential to be significantly different than what is listed below due to a wide variety of factors. Meeting or exceeding one of these cutoffs does not in any way guarantee that you will receive that tier of rewards once the season has ended.<br />
<br />
Estimated 3v3 Arena Cutoffs:<br />
<br />
<br />
Fearless Gladiator (Horde): 2820<br />

<br />
yeah I don't get why they don't just baseline lower the price on boosts, they would probably sell 2x to 3x as many if they dropped the price by like $20 bucks, I mean you have to really really hate leveling to be willing to drop retail price for a brand new AAA game to boost a single character</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be fair the idea of a boost value is to not make you go crazy and buy a load at once which I do understand. My point was they are jacking up the prices in less than 2 weeks and they discounted all the other services except that.<br />
<br />
But yeah with a boost being £49 soon for us hell no. Leveling takes no time at all.</div></div><hr />

This should be clarified. You don't NEED to have Artifact Knowledge maxed out. Once 7.2 goes live, you'll be able to insta-buy research notes for 500 resources per, up to lvl 25. <br />
<br />
So if, say, you're at AK20 when 7.2 drops, you can immediately get up to AK25 with 2500 order resources (5 notes at 500 resources per).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, while the rep tokens cannot be used for post-exalted rewards, they will vendor for a modest amount of gold. So don't destroy them if you've been holding onto some all this time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're basically just ilvl... you've been able to buy certain gear for gold for YEARS, right now you could hit 865+ in every slot for gold... what difference does it make that a 940 can be bought for gold? You'd still be at or below N NH ilvl.<br />
<br />
If you want to see ACTUAL p2w, go look at rift, you can buy current raid gear for money &gt;.&gt;</div></div><hr />

Short answer, you don't, longer answer.... to have a DH you need a higher lever character which means you have SOME character you can get it on.</div></div><hr />

GROSS!<br />

If you've actually been playing WoW during the Legion expansion, you'll have done all those things already.<br />
<br />
And if you haven't, why would you feel the need to instantly jump into the new 7.2 stuff when there's so much stuff you haven't looked at yet?</div></div><hr />

eg: balance 43 / feral 36. After 7.2 balance 35 / feral 35. Can I use AP to make feral 35++++ / balance 35 or I can use the excess AP ONLY for balance/feral?<br />

The AP will remain on the weapon you originally put it on.</div></div><hr />

I'm at level 108 and hoping to hit 110 today or tomorrow and haven't used any of the AP gaining items that you get throughout the zones.

Just want to make sure I don't lose out as I've been planning to use them once I hit max level since I want to use them on my healing spec, but have been leveling with an Enhancement dps spec.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh my god, dude. You are a going through a ton of hassle.<br />
<br />
Go get your healing artifact if you don't already have it. Then switch to your healing spec and then click on all the Artifact power tokens. They will all go to your healing spec. You don't need to save them up. But to answer your question, no they won't disappear on Tuesday.<br />
<br />
Second, all of your tokens are really low AP right now. When you hit 110, you'll be able to get started on world quests. Do the ones with resources and then try to get a ton of these. With these resources you can then buy Artifact knowledge levels (500resources/level). Doing this will boost how much AP you get per token. On any NEW tokens you get after you acquire that AK. Getting AP this way will completely dwarf the current ap you have because you'll be getting THOUSANDS at once.</div></div><hr />
