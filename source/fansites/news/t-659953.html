Patch 3.2 - Where can I get Epic Gems?<br />
The patch will probably hit the live servers very soon and a lot of people ask me the same question : Where can I get the Epic Gems? It shouldn't be hard to answer that, currently there are 4 ways to get them :<br />
<br />
Jewelcrafting / Prospecting<br />
You can find epic gems by prospecting Titanium Ore (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/36910/titanium-ore/), it's probably not the best way to get it because Titanium is already fairly expensive but if you need as many gems as possible and don't want to wait, go for it. Prospecting Titanium will give you an epic gem 25~30% of the time, the droprate for rare gems seems to be the same, and you will always get an uncommon gem. If you're lucky enough you can even get 2 epics on the same prospect. <br />
<br />
Note: You will also get Titanium Powder (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/46849/titanium-powder/) 60% of the time, you can exchange 10 of them for a Dalaran Jewelcrafter's Token (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/41596/dalaran-jewelcrafters-token/) and get your new recipes even faster. <br />
<br />
Alchemy<br />
New transmutations are available for these gems. (20 Hours cooldown)<br />
<br />
Transmute: Ametrine (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/66658/transmute-ametrine/)<br />
Transmute: Cardinal Ruby (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/66659/transmute-cardinal-ruby/)<br />
Transmute: Dreadstone (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/66662/transmute-dreadstone/)<br />
Transmute: Eye of Zul (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/66664/transmute-eye-of-zul/)<br />
Transmute: King's Amber (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/66660/transmute-kings-amber/)<br />
Transmute: Majestic Zircon (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/66663/transmute-majestic-zircon/)<br />
<br />
PvE - Emblems of Heroism<br />
You can buy any of the epic gems for Emblem of Heroism (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/40752/emblem-of-heroism/). These emblems do not drop anymore in 3.2 and are replaced by Emblems of Conquest in heroic instances / raids dungeons but you can still exchange higher tier emblems. (Emblem of Conquest (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/45624/emblem-of-conquest/) -&gt; Emblem of Valor (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/40753/emblem-of-valor/) &gt; Emblem of Heroism (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/40752/emblem-of-heroism/).<br />
<br />
[color=#A335EE]Cardinal Ruby (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/36919/cardinal-ruby/), [color=#A335EE]Majestic Zircon (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/36925/majestic-zircon/), [color=#A335EE]King's Amber (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/36922/kings-amber/) can be bought for Emblem of Heroism (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/40752/emblem-of-heroism/) x 20.<br />
[color=#A335EE]Ametrine (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/36931/ametrine/), [color=#A335EE]Dreadstone (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/36928/dreadstone/), [color=#A335EE]Eye of Zul (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/36934/eye-of-zul/) can be bought for Emblem of Heroism (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/40752/emblem-of-heroism/) x 10.<br />
<br />
PvP - Honor<br />
Last but not least, you can buy any of the epic gem for 10,000 Honor Points (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/43308/honor-points/).<br />
<br />
<br />
Upcoming Upper Deck TCG Mount Changes<br />
I announced that a few weeks ago, this is now confirmed.<br />
In the upcoming content patch 3.2, Call of the Crusade, we are changing the Upper Deck Trading Card Game mounts to be Bind-on-Use instead of Bind-on-Pickup. This will allow players to sell newly redeemed TCG mounts in-game through the trade window, Auction House or via CoD. The primary goal behind this change is to help reduce the number of players who are getting scammed by trading for an invalid mount code. As part of this update, the NPC vendor functionality currently in place for these mounts will be removed, and instead the mount (both epic and non-epic when applicable), will now be immediately placed in your inventory upon the verified redemption of the code. If you have already redeemed one of these codes and have not purchased both the epic and non-epic versions from the vendor window, it's important that you do so before the patch is released.<br />
<br />
This update will affect the Spectral Tiger, Swift Spectral Tiger, X-51 Nether-Rocket, X-51 Nether-Rocket X-TREME, Big Battle Bear, and Magic Rooster Egg. Items that were obtained before the patch will not be affected by this change and will continue to be soulbound to the character that purchased them. <br />
<br />

<br />
&#13; General&#13;&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Construction of the Crusaders' Coliseum is complete. New raid normal and Heroic modes for the Crusaders' Coliseum can be toggled using the Dungeon Difficulty setting. This applies to 10 and 25-player versions. 10-player (normal), 25-player (normal), 10-player (Heroic) and 25-player (Heroic) all share separate raid lockout timers.&#13;&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Trial of the Champion&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; 5-player (normal and Heroic mode) dungeon.&#13; Daily quest added to the Heroic daily dungeon quest giver.&#13;&#13; [/list]&#13; Trial of the Crusader&#13;&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; 10 and 25-player (normal mode) raid dungeon.&#13; [/list]&#13; Trial of the Grand Crusader&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13;&#13; 10 and 25-player (Heroic mode) raid dungeon.&#13; Crusaders' Tribute: Active on Heroic difficulty only, the tribute system will limit players on the number of attempts the raid is allotted each week. Additional rewards can be earned depending on the number of attempts left in the tribute run each week when the final boss is defeated.&#13;&#13; [/list]&#13; [/list]&#13; Isle of Conquest, the new 40 vs. 40-player siege-style battleground is now available for testing.&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Two level brackets are available: 71-79 and 80.&#13;&#13; Defend the walls of your keep and protect your general by killing enemy players and destroying their siege vehicles.&#13; Capture the Docks, Gunship Hangar, or Siege Workshop for access to destructive siege vehicles or strategic attacks on your enemy's base.&#13;&#13; Capture the Refinery or Quarry for their resources to garner reinforcements, a steady flow of bonus honor and a 15% increase to siege vehicle damage for each of these capture points your team controls.&#13; To claim victory, bust through the enemy's keep walls (or find other ways to get inside) and kill their general, or obliterate your opponents until their reinforcements are depleted.&#13; [/list]&#13; The Argent Tournament Expands&#13;&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; All new Argent Crusader daily quests and rewards have been added for players with the Crusader title. Rewards include a new Argent Crusader banner and tabard (which can port players to the tournament grounds), a mounted squire (can periodically run bank, mail or vendor errands for the player), a paladin-exclusive Argent Crusader Charger mount, and new heirloom items.&#13;&#13; All new Silver Covenant and Sunreaver daily quests and rewards have been added for players exalted with these factions. Rewards include tabards, new ground and flying mounts, and a new pet.&#13; Just when you thought you had seen the last of the Black Knight, he makes his astonishing return to the tournament. Wait, didn't you kill him?&#13; [/list]&#13; New Dungeon Loot Feature&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13;&#13; Players will now be able to trade soulbound items with other raid or group members that were eligible for the loot. This system will work like the Item Buy Back system and allow 2 hours for players to trade an item after it has been looted. Players who choose to enchant or add gems to the item will get one last confirmation before losing the ability to trade the item.&#13;&#13; [/list]&#13; New druid art for Cat Form and Bear Form has been added. There are now five unique color schemes for each form and faction. Changing hair color (night elves) or skin tone (tauren) via the barbershop will change the look of one's cat and bear forms.&#13; Copied Test Realm characters will no longer be copied with their achievement history in order to better facilitate the character copy process.&#13; [/list]&#13; &lt;/p&gt;&#13; <br />
<br />
&#13;&#13; PvP&#13;&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Arenas&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Beginning with season 7, players will no longer have access to the newest season's weapons or shoulder armor and will not qualify for the Gladiator title/rewards with ratings from the 2v2 bracket alone. Ratings obtained through 3v3 and 5v5 game play will be required for these rewards, while the rest of the newest season's items will remain available to players in all brackets (standard rating restrictions still apply).&#13; Dalaran Sewers&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13;&#13; The entire Arena has increased in size by 25%.&#13;&#13; Mounts can now be used in this Arena.&#13; The position and collision of the crates on the central platform has been modified.&#13; [/list]&#13; Ring of Valor&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; The flame wall has been removed.&#13;&#13; [/list]&#13; Ruins of Lordaeron&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Alcoves have been removed from the starting chambers.&#13; The collision around the central tomb has been smoothed out to prevent players from becoming stuck on the terrain as often.&#13; [/list]&#13; [/list]&#13;&#13; Battlegrounds&#13; &lt;ul&gt; &#13; Battleground experience has arrived!&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Players will now be awarded experience for completing objectives and actions that yield honor in Battlegrounds (honorable kills not included).&#13; Players who do not wish to gain experience through PvP can visit Behsten in Stormwind or Slahtz in Orgrimmar - both located near the Battlemasters in either city - and turn off all experience accumulation for the cost of 10 gold.&#13; Disabling experience gains will prevent a player from gaining experience through any means available in the game.&#13;&#13; Players with experience gains turned off who compete in Battlegrounds will face off only against other players with experience gains turned off.&#13; Behsten and Slahtz can reinstate experience gains for players, for a 10 gold fee of course. Any experience that would've been accumulated if experience gains were enabled cannot be recovered.&#13; [/list]&#13; Battlemasters in major cities affiliated with specific Battlegrounds have been replaced with a Battlemaster for each faction that will allow players to queue for any Battleground. Battlemasters for specific Battlegrounds will still be seen around the cities during corresponding Battleground holiday weekends.&#13; When standing at a capture point that you control, you will gain a buff called Honorable Defender. This buff grants +50% honor gained from kills. This currently affects Arathi Basin, Eye of the Storm and Isle of Conquest.&#13; Arathi Basin&#13;&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; The time it requires to capture a base has been reduced to 8 seconds, down from 10 seconds.&#13; The game now ends when one team reaches 1600 victory points, down from 2000.&#13; [/list]&#13; Eye of the Storm&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; The time it requires to capture the center flag has been reduced to 8 seconds, down from 10 seconds&#13;&#13; The game now ends when one team reaches 1600 victory points, down from 2000.&#13; [/list]&#13; Strand of the Ancients&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; The faction starting on attack/defense will now be randomized at the start of each match.&#13; [/list]&#13; Warsong Gulch&#13;&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; There is a now a 20-minute timer on this Battleground. After that time, the team with the most flag captures wins. If this would result in a tie, the team that captured the first flag wins. If neither side has captured a flag, then the game ends in a tie.&#13; [/list]&#13; [/list]&#13; Wintergrasp&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Against the Odds: This achievement has been removed and converted to a Feat of Strength.&#13;&#13; Industrial Warfare: This achievement has been removed.&#13; To provide players with a more transparent notification of when Wintergrasp battles occur, as well as better control zone population and stability, several changes have been made.&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Players now have the option to queue for Wintergrasp from a Wintergrasp Battlemaster in any capital city or by simply entering the Wintergrasp zone.&#13; Queuing will begin 15 minutes before each battle. If chosen, you will automatically be teleported to the zone. Any players in the zone who have not been chosen from the queue will be teleported out when the battle begins.&#13; The queue system remains active for the entire battle. As soon as a player leaves, a new one will be chosen from the queue.&#13;&#13; Trying to enter Wintergrasp during an active battle for which you have not been chosen will teleport you out. Please note that, as you are now able to fly over Wintergrasp, you will only be teleported out if you try to land and join the battle.&#13; Level 80 players get higher priority in the queue than lower level players. In addition, a random selection of queued players will be taken from both the Battlemasters and the zone itself.&#13; The queue will accept up to 120 players from each faction, resulting in a maximum battle of 240 players at a time.&#13; [/list]&#13; Wintergrasp factories can no longer be damaged or destroyed.&#13; [/list]&#13;&#13; [/list]&#13;&#13; &lt;/p&gt;&#13; <br />

&#13; Dungeons and Raids&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Dungeon and Raid ID Extensions&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13;&#13; In order to allow for parties and raids to progress through instances at their own pace, players can now extend an instance ID on an individual basis.&#13;&#13; Existing or recently expired IDs can be extended via the Social tab under Raid by clicking on Raid Info.&#13; The ID of any instance to which a player is saved can be extended. Doing so will extend the instance lock period by the same amount of time as the original lock (i.e. extending an Ulduar instance ID will add 7 days, a Heroic: Halls of Lightning instance ID will add 24 hours, and a Zul'Gurub instance ID will add 3 days to the instance lock time).&#13; An ID can be extended more than once.&#13; An extension can be reversed on an individual basis provided the player does not do anything in the instance during the extended instance lock period that would save that player to the instance.&#13; [/list]&#13;&#13; Emblem System Changes&#13;&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Both the 10 and 25-player instances of the Crusaders' Coliseum drop a new Emblem of Triumph.&#13; Any dungeons that previously dropped Emblems of Heroism or Valor, such as Naxxramas or Heroic Halls of Stone, will now drop Emblems of Conquest instead. Emblems of Conquest can still be converted to Valor or Heroism.&#13; The Heroic dungeon daily quest will now reward 2 Emblems of Triumph and the normal daily dungeon quest will reward 1 Emblem of Conquest.&#13; The existing achievements to collect 1, 25, 50, etc. Emblems of Heroism, Valor, and Conquest have been converted to Feats of Strength since Heroism and Valor Emblems are no longer attainable.&#13;&#13; New achievements have been added to collect various amounts of any combination of emblems.&#13;&#13; [/list]&#13; 25-player raids will no longer be referred to as Heroic versions of a raid, as there is a new distinction between normal and Heroic modes for both 10 and 25 player versions of the Crusaders' Coliseum.&#13; The Nexus: The Oculus &amp; The Eye of Eternity&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Drakes used by players in these instances will now scale in health and damage according to the rider's average item level.&#13;&#13; [/list]&#13; Ulduar&#13;&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Players can now use Blink, Shadowstep, and Demonic Teleport while participating in the illusion events in the Yogg-Saron encounter.&#13; Ominous Clouds in the Yogg-Saron encounter are now more vocal about touching players and should no longer sometimes appear to be in the wrong place for certain players.&#13; An Immortal Guardian targeted for Empowering Shadows in the Yogg-Saron encounter will now become a 'Marked Immortal Guardian' while targeted.&#13;&#13; Crusher Tentacles in the Yogg-Saron encounter spawn a little slower in 25-player mode allowing a bit more time for players to clear out the Illusion room.&#13; Empowering Shadows in the Yogg-Saron encounter now targets a maximum of three Immortal Guardians in 25-player mode.&#13;&#13; Yogg-Saron's health has been reduced by 20% in the final stage of his 25-player mode.&#13; Winter Jormungars will no longer put everyone in the zone in combat when they emerge from a Snow Mound. Additionally, Snow Mounds will now disappear when all their jormungars have emerged.&#13; [/list]&#13; [/list]&#13;&#13; &lt;/p&gt;&#13; <br />
<br />
&#13; Races: General&#13;&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Axe Specialization (Orc): The weapon bonus from this effect now applies to fist weapons in addition to axes.&#13; Tauren now have the option of changing skin tone by visiting the barber shop.&#13; [/list]&#13;&#13; &lt;/p&gt;&#13; <br />
<br />
&#13; Items: General&#13;&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Agility: The amount of agility required per percentage of dodge has been increased by 15%. This change required recalibrating the amount of dodge a player has with 0 agility by a slight amount as well, so all players will see their dodge percentage vary a small amount.&#13; Block Value: The amount of bonus block value on all items has been doubled. This does not affect the base block value on shields or block value derived from strength.&#13; On-Use Block Value Items: All items and set bonuses that trigger temporary increases to block value have been modified. Instead of increasing their block value amount by 100% like other items, they have all had their effect durations doubled. This applies to Glyph of Deflection, Gnomeregan Autoblocker, Coren's Lucky Coin, Lavanthor's Talisman, Libram of Obstruction, Tome of the Lightbringer, Libram of the Sacred Shield, the tier-8 paladin Shield of Righteousness bonus, the tier-5 paladin Holy Shield bonus, and the tier-5 warrior Shield Block bonus.&#13;&#13; Dodge Rating: The amount of dodge rating required per percentage of dodge has been increased by 15%. This is before diminishing returns. Combined with other changes, this makes dodge rating and parry rating equally potent before diminishing returns apply.&#13; Item Buy Back Feature Revised&#13;&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; The Item Buy Back time will now expire if the player enchants or sockets an item. Players will see a confirmation dialog box now when they attempt to enchant or add gems to an item giving them a last chance to reconsider.&#13; [/list]&#13; Items with Triggered Effects: These items generally have cooldowns on how often they can be triggered. Those cooldowns are now triggered each time the item is equipped (example: A trinket has a 45-second cooldown on an effect triggered by player attacks; when a player equips that item, the effect will be unable to be triggered for the first 45 seconds it is worn).&#13;&#13; Mounts&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; The cast time for summoning any ground mount is now 1.5 seconds, down from 3 seconds.&#13;&#13; Apprentice Riding (Skill 75): Can now be learned at level 20 for 4 gold. Mail will be sent to players who reach level 20 directing them to the riding trainer.&#13; Journeyman Riding (Skill 150): Can now be learned at level 40 for 50 gold. Mail will be sent to players who reach level 40 directing them back to the riding trainer.&#13; Expert Riding (Skill 225): Can now be learned at level 60 for 600 gold from trainers in Honor Hold or Thrallmar. Faction discounts now apply (Honor Hold for Alliance; Thrallmar for Horde). Flight speed at this skill level has been increased to 150% of run speed, up from 60%.&#13;&#13; Artisan Riding (Skill 300): Faction discounts now apply (Honor Hold or Valiance Expedition for Alliance; Thrallmar or Warsong Offensive for Horde).&#13; In order to further equalize the number of purchasable mounts available to each race, a new 60% speed ground mount has been added for night elves, and a new 100% speed ground mount has been added for the undead.&#13; Flying over Dalaran and Wintergrasp is now possible so long as players keep a healthy distance above the ground.&#13;&#13; [/list]&#13; Mana Regeneration: All items that provide &quot;X mana per five seconds&quot; have had the amount of mana they regenerate increased by approximately 25%.&#13; Parry Rating: The amount of parry rating required per percentage of parry has been reduced by 8%. This is before diminishing returns. Combined with other changes, this makes dodge rating and parry rating equally potent before diminishing returns apply. Parry still diminishes more quickly than dodge.&#13;&#13; Resilience: No longer reduces the amount of damage done by damage-over-time spells, but instead reduces the amount of all damage done by players by the same proportion. In addition, the amount of resilience needed to reduce critical strike chance, critical strike damage and overall damage has been increased by 15%.&#13; [/list]&#13; &lt;/p&gt;&#13; <br />
<br />
&#13;&#13; Classes: General&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; All pets now receive 40% of their master's resilience and 100% of their master's spell penetration. In addition, if a player is at their appropriate spell hit chance or hit chance maximum, their pet will be at the maximum for spell hit chance, hit chance, and expertise. If they are below the maximum, their pet will be proportionately below those maximums.&#13;&#13; Replenishment: This buff now grants 1% of the target's maximum mana over 5 seconds instead of 0.25% per second. This applies to all 5 sources of Replenishment (Vampiric Touch, Judgements of the Wise, Hunting Party, Enduring Winter Frostbolts and Soul Leech).&#13; Silence, Strangulate, Silencing Shot, and Arcane Torrent: These abilities will also apply a 3-second Interrupt effect against non-player controlled targets, making them more versatile against creatures immune to silencing effects.&#13; [/list]&#13; &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13; <br />
<br />
&#13; Death Knights&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13;&#13; Due to significant talent changes, all death knight talents will be reset for players.&#13; Blood Plague: Damage done increased by 15%.&#13; Chains of Ice: Now reduces movement by 95% instead of 100%. The main effect of this change will be that targets of Chains of Ice will not have to re-issue a movement command to continue moving.&#13; Frost Fever: Damage done increased by 15%.&#13;&#13; Frost Presence: 10% bonus health reduced to 6% bonus stamina.&#13; Frost Strike: This ability can now be dodged, parried, or blocked. Weapon damage bonus reduced to 55%, down from 60%.&#13;&#13; Icebound Fortitude: Cooldown increased to 2 minutes.&#13; Talents&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Blood&#13;&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Bloody Strikes: This talent now provides 5/10/15% increased damage to Blood Strike instead of 15/30/45%.&#13;&#13; Dancing Rune Weapon: This ability now has a fixed duration of 12 seconds (which can still be modified by its glyph) and a fixed cost of 60 runic power.&#13; Veteran of the Third War: Stamina bonus reduced to 1/2/3%.&#13; [/list]&#13; Frost&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13;&#13; Blood of the North: Reduced to a 3-point talent. Increases Blood Strike and Frost Strike damage by 3/6/10%. There is now a 33/66/100% chance whenever you hit with Blood Strike or Pestilence that the Blood Rune will become a Death Rune when it activates.&#13;&#13; Lichborne: Duration reduced to 10 seconds, and cooldown reduced to 2 minutes.&#13; Threat of Thassarian: New 3-point talent. When dual-wielding, your Death Strikes, Obliterates, Plague Strikes, Blood Strikes and Frost Strikes have a 30/60/100% chance to also deal damage with your off-hand weapon. Off-hand strikes are roughly one half the effect of the original strike.&#13; Toughness: This talent now grants 2/4/6/8/10% armor instead of 3/6/9/12/15%, placing it in line with similar abilities of other classes.&#13; [/list]&#13; Unholy&#13;&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13;&#13; Desecration: This talent has been reduced to 2 points for 25/50% snare and no longer increases damage done by the death knight. It has also been moved one tier earlier in the tree and its spell effect has been made more transparent.&#13; Desolation: New talent. This talent is in the position formerly occupied by Desecration. It causes Blood Strikes to increase all damage the death knight deals by 1/2/3/4/5% for 12 seconds.&#13; Scourge Strike: Weapon damage bonus reduced to 40%, down from 45%. Damage increased by 10% per disease on the target, down from 11%.&#13; Summon Gargoyle: The gargoyle now flies lower to the ground, making it susceptible to melee attacks. This ability now has a fixed duration of 30 seconds and a fixed cost of 60 runic power.&#13; Unholy Blight: This talent has been redesigned. It no longer deals damage to nearby targets. Instead, when you deal damage with Death Coil, the target will take periodic damage for 10 seconds equal to 20% of the damage done by Death Coil. This damage accumulates in the same way as Ignite and Deep Wounds.&#13;&#13; [/list]&#13;&#13; [/list]&#13; [/list]&#13; &lt;/p&gt;	&#13; <br />
<br />
&#13; Druids&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Enrage: This Bear Form ability now generates 20 rage initially, and 10 rage over the next 10 seconds. The armor penalty is unchanged.&#13;&#13; Flight Form: Can now be learned at level 60. Flight speed increased to 150%.&#13;&#13; Flight Form and Swift Flight Form: Now benefit from a paladin's Crusader Aura.&#13; Innervate: Duration reduced to 10 seconds, and cooldown reduced to 3 minutes. This means each use of Innervate will give half as much mana as before, but it will be available twice as often.&#13; Lifebloom: The final heal that occurs when this spell blooms has been reduced by 20% on the base and on the spell power coefficient.&#13; Mangle: Ranks 4 and 5 base points reduced by about 11%. Scaling from attack power unchanged.&#13; Rake: Ranks 6 and 7 base points on initial and periodic damage reduced by about 7%. Scaling from attack power unchanged.&#13;&#13; Rip: Ranks 8 and 9 base points and points per combo point reduced by about 6%. Scaling from attack power unchanged.&#13;&#13; Savage Defense: The animation for gaining this buff will no longer make the bear stand upright&#13; Shred: Ranks 8 and 9 base points reduced by about 10%. Scaling from attack power unchanged.&#13; Swift Flight Form: Druids who have acquired a mount able to go 310% flight speed will now also go that speed while in this form.&#13; Swipe (Cat): Percent of weapon damage done reduced from 260% to 250%.&#13; Travel Form: Can now be learned at level 16.&#13;&#13; Talents&#13;&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Balance&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Balance of Power: Now reduces all spell damage taken by 3/6%, rather than reducing the chance to be hit by spells by 2/4%.&#13; Eclipse: The Starfire and Wrath buffs from this talent are now on separate 30-second cooldowns. In addition, it is not possible to have both buffs active simultaneously.&#13; Owlkin Frenzy: Now also restores 2% base mana every 2 seconds for the duration (10 seconds) in addition to its current effects.&#13;&#13; [/list]&#13; Feral Combat&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; King of the Jungle: This talent now reduces the mana cost of Bear Form, Cat Form, and Dire Bear Form by 20/40/60%.&#13; Primal Tenacity: This talent no longer reduces the mana cost of Bear Form, Cat Form, and Dire Bear Form.&#13; [/list]&#13; Restoration&#13;&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Empowered Touch: Now also increases the amount of bonus healing effects for Nourish by 10/20%.&#13; Improved Barkskin: No longer provides dispel resistance to all effects on the druid, but now reduces the chance your Barkskin is dispelled by an additional 35/70%.&#13; [/list]&#13; [/list]	&#13; [/list]&#13; &lt;/p&gt;&#13; <br />
<br />
&#13;&#13; Hunters&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Aspect of the Cheetah: Can now be learned at level 16.&#13; Deterrence: This ability now allows the hunter to parry spells and attacks from behind as well as in front. Now has a new visual spell effect.&#13; The time that traps will exist in the world after being put down has been reduced to 30 seconds, down from 1 minute.&#13; Frost Trap: Will no longer &quot;fizzle&quot; on targets immune to snare effects, however Lock and Load will not succeed when using Frost Trap if the target is immune to snare effects.&#13;&#13; Snake Trap: The Mind-numbing Poison effect has been reduced to a 30% increase in casting time, down from 50% to match similar effects.&#13; Traps now have separate 30-second cooldown categories: Fire (Immolation Trap, Explosive Trap and Black Arrow), Frost (Freezing Trap, Frost Trap) and Nature (Snake Trap). A hunter can have one trap of each category placed at one time.&#13; Talents&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Beast Mastery&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13;&#13; Catlike Reflexes now also reduces the cooldown of your Kill Command ability by 10/20/30 seconds.&#13;&#13; [/list]&#13; Survival&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Entrapment: This talent no longer works with Immolation Trap or Explosive Trap.&#13; Lock and Load: Now has a 22-second cooldown. The Lock and Load effect cannot be obtained on targets immune to snare effects when Frost Trap is used.&#13;&#13; [/list]&#13; Pets&#13;&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Roar of Sacrifice: Redesigned. This ability can now be used on any friendly target to make that target immune to critical strikes, but the hunter pet takes 20% of all damage taken by that friendly target. Cooldown is now 1 minute, up from 30 seconds.&#13; [/list]&#13; [/list]&#13; [/list]&#13;&#13; &lt;/p&gt;&#13; <br />
<br />

<br />
&#13; Paladins&#13;&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Blessing of Sanctuary: This blessing now also increases stamina by 10%. This effect is not cumulative with Blessing of Kings.&#13; Charger: Can now be learned at level 40.&#13;&#13; Crusader Aura: This ability now also grants its flying speed increase to a druid's Flight Form and Swift Flight Form.&#13; Exorcism: Now has a 1.5 second cast time, but can once again be used on players.&#13; Hand of Reckoning: Redesigned. Now does damage only when the target does not currently have the caster targeted, but damage done increased to 50% of attack power, occurring after the taunt effect is applied.&#13;&#13; Judgements: Some of these attacks were considered ranged and some melee. They are all now considered melee attacks that can't be dodged, parried or blocked.&#13; Judgement of Light: Now heals for 2% of the attacker's maximum health instead of a variable amount based on the spell power and attack power of the judging paladin.&#13; Lay on Hands: The buff from this ability now reduces the physical damage taken by the target by 10/20% instead of increasing the target's armor.&#13;&#13; Righteous Fury: No longer has a duration, remaining until cancelled or death. Also cancelled when a Paladin activates a different talent specialization.&#13; Sacred Shield: When a paladin casts Flash of Light on a target with this buff, they also now place a heal-over-time effect on the target, healing that target for 100% of the Flash of Light amount over 12 seconds.&#13; Seal of Blood: This ability has been removed.&#13;&#13; Seal of the Martyr: This ability has been removed.&#13; Seal of Vengeance and Seal of Corruption: These seals have been redesigned to deal substantially more damage. Now, once a paladin has 5 copies of the debuff from these seals on his or her target, on each swing the paladin will deal 33% weapon damage as Holy, with critical strikes dealing double damage. In addition, the damage-over-time effect is now considered a melee attack instead of a spell attack and the effects from these seals can only be triggered by auto-attacks and Hammer of the Righteous.&#13; Shield of Righteousness: Now deals 100% of shield block value as damage instead of 130%. In addition, the benefit from additional block value this ability gains is now subject to diminishing returns. Diminishing returns occur once block value exceeds 30 times the player's level and caps the maximum damage benefit from shield block value at 34.5 times the player's level.&#13;&#13; Warhorse: Can now be learned at level 20.&#13; Talents&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13;&#13; Holy&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Beacon of Light: The healing amount on the Beacon of Light target is now based on the total healing done (including over-healing) instead of the effective healing done. Radius increased to 60 yards. Multiple Paladins can now have this active on the same target. Buff indicating a player is within range of the Beacon target is no longer displayed.&#13;&#13; Divine Intellect: This talent now gives 2/4/6/8/10% increased intellect instead of 3/6/9/12/15%.&#13; Illumination: This talent now returns 30% of the mana cost of the spell instead of 60%.&#13; [/list]&#13; Protection&#13;&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Ardent Defender: Redesigned. Any damage that takes the paladin below 35% health is reduced. This reduction applies only to the portion that pushes the paladin below 35% health (example: a paladin at 50% health takes a 40% hit; the first 15% hits as normal while the next 25% is reduced). In addition, once every 2 minutes an attack that would have killed the paladin will fail to kill, and instead heal the paladin for up to 10/20/30% of maximum health depending on the paladin's defense rating (example: a paladin with defense equal to only 5 times his or her level will receive no healing from the talent, while a paladin who is immune to critical strikes from boss creatures through defense will receive the maximum amount).&#13;&#13; Guarded by the Light: This talent will no longer cause Divine Plea's duration to be refreshed by using Judgement of Wisdom, Judgement of Justice, or Judgement of Light.&#13; [/list]&#13; Retribution&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Art of War: Now only applies to melee critical hits, but will make your next Flash of Light or Exorcism instant. In addition, this talent now provides notification in the floating combat text when it activates.&#13;&#13; Crusader Strike: Damage reduced to 75% weapon damage to match the new 4-second cooldown. Mana cost reduced to 5% of base mana.&#13;&#13; Seal of Command: Redesigned. This seal now deals 36% weapon damage on every swing, and deals substantially less judgement damage.&#13; Vindication: Redesigned. Now lowers target attack power, is consistent and does not stack with Demoralizing Shout.&#13; [/list]&#13; [/list]&#13; [/list]&#13; &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13; <br />
<br />
&#13;&#13; Priests&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Prayer of Healing: The percentage of spell power this spell gains in healing (per target) has been reduced from 80.7% to 52.6%.&#13; Psychic Horror: This spell no longer has an invisible missile, so there is no travel time before the spell takes effect.&#13; Talents&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13;&#13; Discipline&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Penance: Cooldown increased to 12 seconds, up from 10 seconds.&#13; [/list]&#13; Holy&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Inspiration: The buff from this ability now reduces the physical damage taken by the target by 3/7/10% instead of increasing the target's armor.&#13;&#13; [/list]&#13; Shadow&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Dispersion: Cooldown reduced to 2 minutes, down from 3 minutes.&#13; Improved Mind Blast: Redesigned. Now, in addition to reducing the cooldown of your Mind Blast spell by .5/1/1.5/2/2.5 seconds, while in Shadowform your Mind Blast also has a 20/40/60/80/100% chance to reduce all healing done to the target by 20% for 10 seconds.&#13; Vampiric Touch: The amount of damage done when this spell is dispelled has been doubled.&#13;&#13; [/list]&#13;&#13; [/list]&#13; [/list]&#13; &lt;/p&gt;&#13; <br />
<br />
&#13; Rogues&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; After much quiet contemplation, rogues now possess the ability to learn how to use one-handed axes.&#13;&#13; Talents&#13;&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Combat&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Sword Specialization: This talent is now called Hack and Slash and applies to axes as well as swords.&#13; [/list]&#13; Subtlety&#13;&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13;&#13; Shadow Dance: Cooldown reduced to 1 minute. Now lasts 6 seconds, down from 10 seconds.&#13; [/list]&#13; [/list]&#13; [/list]&#13; &lt;/p&gt;&#13; <br />
<br />
&#13; Shamans&#13;&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13;&#13; A customizable totem bar will now be available for shamans allowing the storing of 4 different totems. These totems can be placed on the ground at once in one global cooldown for the combined mana cost of all 4 totems. The naming scheme of the spells to summon the different totem sets has been changed to make it less confusing for players:&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Call of Fire (Totem Bar 1, the first one gained at level 30) is now named Call of the Elements.&#13; Call of Water (Totem Bar 2) is now named Call of the Ancestors.&#13; Call of Air (Totem Bar 3) is now named Call of the Spirits.&#13;&#13; Call of Earth (the spell to recall all summoned totems) is now named Totemic Recall.&#13;&#13; [/list]&#13; All Shocks now have a default range of 25 yards, up from 20 yards.&#13; Base health increased by approximately 7% to correct for shamans having lower health than other classes.&#13; Chain Heal: Jump distance increased by 25% to 12.5 yards. In addition, the amount of healing now decreases by 40% as it jumps to each new target, instead of 50%.&#13; Earth Shock: Redesigned. This spell no longer interrupts spell casting, but rather reduces melee attack speed by 10% for 8 seconds (exclusive with similar effects such as Thunder Clap).&#13;&#13; Ghost Wolf: Can now be learned at level 16. While in this form, snaring effects may not bring the shaman below base normal run speed.&#13;&#13; Wind Shock: Has been renamed Wind Shear and no longer shares a cooldown with Flame, Frost or Earth Shock.&#13; Talents&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Enhancement&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13;&#13; Maelstrom Weapon: Now also has a chance to reduce the cast time of Hex.&#13; Shamanistic Rage: Cooldown is now 1 minute, down from 2 minutes. Successful melee attacks now have a chance to generate mana equal to 15% of the shaman's attack power, down from 30%.&#13;&#13; [/list]&#13; Restoration&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Ancestral Healing: The buff from this ability now reduces the physical damage taken by the target by 3/7/10% instead of increasing the target's armor.&#13;&#13; Cure Poison and Cure Disease: Combined into a single spell, Cure Toxins.&#13; Earth Shield: Dispel effects will now remove charges of Earth Shield rather than the entire aura.&#13; Healing Way: Redesigned. Rather than providing a chance of increasing Healing Wave spells on a friendly target, this talent now innately increases the effectiveness of the shaman's Healing Wave by 8/16/25%.&#13;&#13; Mana Tide Totem: Totem health now equal to 10% of the shaman's health.&#13; Nature's Guardian: Redesigned. Now has a fixed 100% proc rate, has a 30-second internal cooldown and increases the shaman's maximum health by 3/6/9/12/15% for 10 seconds.&#13; Nature's Swiftness: Cooldown is now 2 minutes, down from 3 minutes.&#13;&#13; Tidal Waves: No longer reduces the cast time of Lesser Healing Wave by 30%. It instead now provides +25% critical strike chance to Lesser Healing Wave, along with the previous 30% cast time benefit to Healing Wave.&#13; Improved Water Shield: This talent now has a 10/20/30% chance to be triggered by Chain Heal, and the charges of Water Shield are no longer consumed by this talent.&#13; [/list]&#13;&#13; [/list]&#13; [/list]&#13; &lt;/p&gt;&#13; <br />

they usually only say its for a patch if its absolutely certain. there's always a chance something could go wrong and they have to push the patch back a week.</div></div><hr />

How about you just shut the hell up with your ignorant and intolerant bs?<br />
<br />
We all know by now that you don't care about Arenas or people who participate in 'em, but let these people have their opinions as they let you have yours.<br />
<br />
<br />
On another note: This patch comes too early PvE-wise too. We're still busy fighting Algalon 25 and working on Yogg w/out Keepers and I'm sure there are enough raids that have even more work left in Ulduar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
WHY.<br />
<br />
In blizzards mind,every patch is a further step into the right direction.<br />
Every change should increase the balance, they dont care if you disagree with some changes, in their opinion these changes are all correct.You would be a bad designer if you let changes slip in you aware of are a bad design.<br />
<br />
imho, launching the patch before season ends ist a big thing for all underrepresented classes, the better classes already had their chance, they either have to compete with others or they camp their rating.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SwiftSM</div><div class="date">2009-08-04, 07:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On another note: This patch comes too early PvE-wise too. We're still busy fighting Algalon 25 and working on Yogg w/out Keepers and I'm sure there are enough raids that have even more work left in Ulduar.<br />
<br />
<br />
So all guilds need all content clear in order to release the next tier? Do you know how many people were barely out of MC when AQ40 and BT were released?<br />
<br />
Or all the guilds just stepping foot into SSC/TK when BT came out?<br />
<br />
I fail to see how pushing out new content is bad just because some people haven't killed the hard modes in the current content. If anything, there should be more content to work on.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ifrit</div><div class="date">2009-08-04, 07:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah because 1 boss released per week is gonna stop people from running Ulduar &gt;.&gt;<br />
It indeed will slow down everything. Besides, with every week, the things you achieve in the &quot;old instance&quot; become more worthless since your gear is improving all the time.<br />
<br />
I'm not one of those people that went back to Nax to kill the last couple of bosses when BC hit. That was laughable and just for ..for what? The LORE? lmfao, lore is dead since they let us defeat C'thun.<br />
<br />
Whatsoever, I LIKE challenges. I even more LIKE to beat them. What I don't like is when given just a blink of an eye as a timeframe to achieve such things and afterwards comes new content, gear and shit that makes all the past goals you achieve by then look pretty trivial.<br />
<br />
But hey, may be that's just me. The Introduction of BC was fine. People that didn't clear Nax 'til then were just slow (as we were) because there was plenty of time. But this time it seems like they can't wait to throw up new content after they almost bored us to death with Nax and OS/EoE for the first couple of months in Wrath..<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and the influences on Arena play if all the balance changes go live are also just plain stupid. I mean c'mon, they didn't nerf Druids and Macestuns until S4 was over. They didn't kill facerolling Shadowfrost-DKs until S5 was over but instead just let S5 end with 3.1 but let S6 start 2 weeks later. Just plain stupid and that is ME saying that, playing R/P in 2's, profiting a lot from the Innervate/LB/Imp. Barkskin Nerfs and playing Warrior/Shaman with my alt, even profiting more...</div></div><hr />

AQ40 and BT? You mean AQ40 and Nax40 I guess.<br />
<br />
And yes, I know it. Blizzard also does and already stated that this was neither intended nor that they thought it was good that way.<br />
<br />
<br />
I fail to see how pushing out new content is bad just because some people haven't killed the hard modes in the current content. If anything, there should be more content to work on.<br />
Things are simple. If there's new content, people move on if they are able. About every guild that has cleared Ulduar 10+Hardmodes and some Ulduar 25 is absolutely able to enter Colliseum.<br />
<br />
Have you seen the gigantic differences concerning itemlevels? Heck, normal 25 Weapons beat hardmode Ulduar loot. Most people will ignore Ulduar once Colliseum is completely enterable including the hardmode versions, just like it happened to Nax (which I never visited again since 3.1 went live).</div></div><hr />

<br />
We all know by now that you don't care about Arenas or people who participate in 'em, but let these people have their opinions as they let you have yours.<br />
<br />
<br />
On another note: This patch comes too early PvE-wise too. We're still busy fighting Algalon 25 and working on Yogg w/out Keepers and I'm sure there are enough raids that have even more work left in Ulduar.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm curious , how does this matter at all ? Continue with that.... when you're done , continue with the new stuff. I mean , if you are concerned about it just do it however you want , patch is out , yeah who cares.... There are loads of people still lvl60 doing preBC raids on my server. They don't care about the patches.</div></div><hr />

see...<br />
people were complaining about blizzard beeing to slow..<br />
they complained that blizzard only balance arena when it's already to late (hello @bcduids).<br />

They could've hotfixed shadowfrost or TNT in no time just the way they did with the first Garg or Explosive Shot damage. Why didn't they?<br />
<br />
They nerfed rogues, priests and rets throughout this season and (approx.) two weeks before it ends they change just about everything. It's not about me feeling disadvanted because of this. I'ma profit of the changes, more than most other players/comps will do. That's not what it's about - it's about consistency. It feels like they do whatever they want to.</div></div><hr />

Agreed. And that was the problem with people suddenly ignoring T5 content completely after the new badge Items and Zul Aman were introduced. Horrible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A few of my friends are pretty high rating but i don't see them Moaning on forums and stuff cause they are better than that and will overcome any change and tbh probably still be high rating.<br />
<br />
In fact myself personally play and enjoy the arena and my DK is receiving some changes in pvp but id still rather content comes quicker cause i for one am gettin a bit bored atm. Only raid twice a week, every other day im just afkin round SW or doin a few arena, i wanna do heroics again and have a reason too.<br />
<br />
Toned down version = good arena players see that this mainly pve game doesn't revolve around the arena and patches cant be pushed back because of that. They will instantly adapt and get there glad titles and whatever. maybe blizz should have warned us but meh, they do most things right, everyone's aloud to make a mistake.</div></div><hr />

As I have been told by a friend of mine that works for Blizzard, Icecrown Citadel will come out September 22nd, 09; the day Aion is released, to keep many WoW players interested, but alas it could just be a rumor. Who knows, but it wouldn't surprise me.</div></div><hr />

Your friend is probably a support monkey, they don't know shit about patch release plans. Clearly they will release the next major patch in 7 weeks while not even having it on PTR yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
right so, since it's their game, and not yours ~.~<br />
The thing is, people cry and cry about how OP this and how OP that is and call for a instant nerf hotfix.<br />
<br />
they get their nerfs, rets are dead, dk are nerfed.<br />
what they are complaining about is that other classes like hunters and shamans could possibly raise to another threat.<br />
<br />
there is no reason why they should delay this patch, dk's have to be nerfed, rets have to be nerfed, shamans have to be buffed, hunters have to be buffed.<br />
The balance should increase, even if it means that the current ladder will be screwed, it will be screwed in a way where more classes will get their gladiator title.</div></div><hr />

what bothers me is how everyone gets so excited about some shallow news like &quot;we have insider information&quot; but not giving an actual source. do you know how &quot;news&quot; work? someone says &quot;patch comes out&quot; in a forum. newswriter A reads it and writes a news about it, citing &quot;insider sources&quot; (maybe to get some &quot;hot news&quot;-clicks, ad-money baby!), newswriter B reads the news and writes his news, citing &quot;trustful sources&quot; and so on. dont believe anything without a solid source (doesnt mean it cant be true) and afaik there isnt any solid source on this yet, only about other related things but none of them states patch is coming, they only support it. so everything you hear is guessed. no facts, thus dont put to much faith into it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Obviously you haven't been on MMO long or you just never pay much attention to whats going on @ mmo-champion.com on patch days.<br />
<br />
So far...they've yet to be wrong.<br />
<br />
MMO does have insider information...they actually work quite closely with Blizzard, surprised you didn't know that. So far, when mmo-champ has said &quot;patch goes live tomorrow&quot; or whatever...it has.<br />
<br />
The fact that only a couple hours after the announcement on mmo-champ the PTR servers were closed, not down..but closed, which means no more testing is needed, which means the patch is good to go.<br />
<br />
I'll be amazed if 3.2 doesn't go live later today, outside of something like the patch servers going down or something along those lines.</div></div><hr />

-Why there are only 12 servers with extra maintenance ?<br />
-Where is the Blizz' Downloader ?<br />
<br />
It was the same last patch, don't you remind ?<br />
It was like all maintenance, but after a little time, we've seen that the patch was deployed.<br />
As i said, we'll have to wait about 4-5 hours before having more news on this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So far...they've yet to be wrong.<br />
<br />
MMO does have insider information...they actually work quite closely with Blizzard, surprised you didn't know that. So far, when mmo-champ has said &quot;patch goes live tomorrow&quot; or whatever...it has.<br />
<br />
The fact that only a couple hours after the announcement on mmo-champ the PTR servers were closed, not down..but closed, which means no more testing is needed, which means the patch is good to go.<br />
<br />
I'll be amazed if 3.2 doesn't go live later today, outside of something like the patch servers going down or something along those lines.<br />
<br />
<br />
This post should end the debate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The extended maintenance is for hardware upgrades to specific battlegroups to fix the Instance Server Full issues. Introducing both hardware and software changes on one day are very risky from a release management perspective. I'd be shocked if 3.2 was today. If it is, I'm glad I'm not on those battlegroups.</div></div><hr />

THE WotLK instance, with only 1 month PTR? yeah right ^^<br />

With the way Blizzard is releasing things these days, nothing is impossible. Blizzard seems desperate to keep players interested while they make things excessively easy. 3.1 and now 3.2 have been rushed like no other.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The 3.2 build is 10192 (see the screenshot of my patched launcher above), the exact same build the PTR was last on. Any size differences might be the result of having one build go straight from 3.1.3 to 3.2.0, rather than all the incremental builds a PTR client ends up needing to download. Live will be the same build we saw on the last PTR, folks.</div></div><hr />

i downloaded the PTR and was unable to gaina ccess due to some bug with having a battlenet account. it got stuck at connecting...no big deal.<br />

i just turned on my client of wow to download the patch etc. and i type in my username and pw and its stuck on connecting just like it did in the ptr with the battlenet.<br />
<br />
i have my buddys info and logged on his acct, which isnt battlenet and he got on and is able to see that all servers are down...etc.<br />
im nervous that all players who merged with battlenet might be stuck at connecting when it goes live tomorrow.<br />

Welcome to MMO's. There are very frequent gear resets. It's part of life. You either keep plugging away to continue to be at the high end, or you stop and fall behind. You can't just get top-end gear and then automatically always be top-end forever.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Afaik those &quot;arena nerds&quot; payed for the exact same service as you &quot;pve nerds&quot; did so how is this fair to those who do arena?<br />

How is it unfair for classes to become more balanced mid-season?</div></div><hr />

Instead return the critchance on our Glyph of Holy Light etc. And give us the chance healing the raid by doing something about CoH, that spell is way to dominant and way to easy to use.<br />
<br />
<br />
6 second CD, relatively weak healing, and the &quot;targets those who need it most&quot; can be annoying when say you are healing a group of 5 casters, and they are spread out too much so it only hits 3 of the 5. Honestly, it was PoH that really boosted our HPS and they nerfed that quite a bit. CoH was just icing on the cake as far as I am concerned.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deathseeker</div><div class="date">2009-08-04, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">its more PoH that seems to be the huge boost in HPS im finding.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also yay new patch! although now im gunna be sad about having to spend gold on epic flight for alts =(<br />
<br />
<br />
I have seen some many times that the top 3 are all priests that used CoH as mainspell for about 40% as a paladin with spells that have castingtime you always fall behind, espacially when you havea druid that hots everyone and profit from that when there is no CoH spam.</div></div><hr />

i downloaded the PTR and was unable to gaina ccess due to some bug with having a battlenet account. it got stuck at connecting...no big deal.<br />
<br />
i just turned on my client of wow to download the patch etc. and i type in my username and pw and its stuck on connecting just like it did in the ptr with the battlenet.<br />
<br />
i have my buddys info and logged on his acct, which isnt battlenet and he got on and is able to see that all servers are down...etc.<br />
im nervous that all players who merged with battlenet might be stuck at connecting when it goes live tomorrow.<br />
<br />
<br />
feedback please<br />

I had the same problem in the ptr. You have to open the launcher, this way the launcher will update too. If you don't do this you will keep getting stuck at the authenticating screen.</div></div><hr />

ok ive been reading some forums...apparently battlenet users have a bug where it shows our wow account as closed when the servers are down for maintenance and then they fix themselves when the servers are back up, sometimes meaning non battlenew players get a bit of a head start getting in game....this is why i cant post on the WOW forums, it says my account dont have any characters. lol :P<br />
<br />
well im relieved, and appreciate your input on the matter. so excited for 3.2 to be here and now it is, and then heartbreak imminent or so i thought of being stuck on connecting FOREVER</div></div><hr />

If they see a problem, they will have 2 weeks or how ever much time they give to adjust... If they decide to reset the arena season with no notification, well to bad so sad I suppose...</div></div><hr />

I was going to run naxx today for hoping of t7.5, and then go into Ulduar, but now i'll just farm Heroics all day, get t8.5, run Naxx for more Emblems, finish of t7.5, go to Ulduar, finish of t8.5 and then do the Coliseum.

<br />
Another question- I see all this past tense reference that is scaring me, what do you mean by &quot;achieved the Crusader title&quot;. I was 5 days away from Champion of the Horde, and Exalted Champion of the Horde, getting my rep from the argent tournament and Durotar to finish off Sen'jin and Orgrimmar. I was going to be Pride of the Horde, My paladin is named Pride you see, quite funny actually. Therefore I ask: Are all the old mounts of the Argent Tournament still available, the Hippogryph and the Thunderbluff Kodo, all that good stuff, and also the new mounts? Is Crusader title still obtainable?<br />
<br />
One last question- As far as retribution goes, vindication no big deal nobody uses that for raids, it wasnt viable since all bosses are immune, and Seal of Command was only used for leveling, also specced out of when raiding, so for that which matters, how has the Seal of Corruption changes and Seal of Blood effected our overall DPS for raids, and how has the change to Crusader's Strike effected our overall DPS for raids?

They have nothing at all to be afraid of. I got in the beta. ROTATING YOUR CHARACTER IN PLACE (not moving, just rotating) cancels spellcasting, conversations with NPC's, and everything else. The game is horribly unpolished and clunky, especially the spellcasting system. Melee is kinda fun, but if you ever want to play a caster, avoid Aion like the plague.</div></div><hr />

I get what you mean but keep in mind that, this new patch that is being put out, doesn't necessarily mean that all of it's content will be made available just yet... perhaps that is one of the reasons the PTR servers are still up... there is still some testing to do and so on... I clearly have no idea, but I'm just saying that it's a possibility...</div></div><hr />

Yeah, it's really important to gameplay difficulty that rotating your character cancel quest windows. It's really, really hard to click the NPC again, and I'm glad games are out there that add &quot;difficulty&quot; through poor UI's. WoW is so ezmoad letting me move a bit in a small range while talking. I'm such a noob. (FYI, want real difficulty? Try FFXI.)</div></div><hr />

Actually, a number of arena players (probably not the best, but whatever) were complaining in this same thread wether it was because of an early stop of the season or because they'd have to continue with all the class and resilience changes. Patch 3.2 = QQ wether it's tied to season end or not.<br />
(and most QQ = stupid, i guess we can agree on that, but no need to insult the ones who were laughing at those QQers)</div></div><hr />

Again, ignorant comments are ignorant. Maybe if you had said something like 1 2 3 5 7 6 4 (like my opening rotation) along with my 10 clique keybinds I would think you know what you are talking about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
No, faction changes are simply a work in progress and won't be available for several months, most likely. Since faction changes are something that'll be served via the website, they're most likely to be announced and launched sometime between patches, as name and gender changes were, rather than simultaneous with a patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You see I am a horde player, but once upon a time I was an alliance player, and I still have remnants of my alliance characters lying around, so I was going to do a SEX, NAME and FACTION change of my lvl 70 Night Elf Hunter named Jintzu, to become a Female Blood Elf Hunter, and level it to 80, transferre accounts, with the paid service, and give her to my girlfriend, as a result giving her an 80 with which she can play with me and we can ride together in the sky on our drakes and what-not (: But all this depends on faction change being true -_-</div></div><hr />

I have a level 80 Troll Hunter, a level 80 Troll Warrior and a Blood Elf Paladin, because trolls can't go Paladin. I'll give you their names if you care to armory them.

Explain me why Blizzard would like paladins to become more then just MT healers so to make us better raidhealers they give us a hot. First of all the hot is to small to withstand XK hits. Second, in order to heal the raid we need to spam HL and that spell eats mana so why do they nerf our manapool with 5% and our regen from crits with 50%. It makes no sence because if we want to heal the MT and th reaid properly we will be OOM fast and thus useless.
