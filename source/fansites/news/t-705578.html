We have increased the potency of the Strength of Wrynn and Hellscream’s Warsong buffs in Icecrown Citadel by an additional 5%. These buffs now increase total health, healing done and damage dealt by 10%. In addition, the number of attempts allotted for all final bosses on Heroic difficulty has been increased to 40. <br />

&quot;Stealth&quot; nerfs<br />
I guess you are using &quot;stealth nerf&quot; as synonymous with &quot;nerf.&quot; My general impression of the use of the term &quot;stealth nerf&quot; is that the developers decide to sneakily change a spell or an ability in a way players won't immediately recognize and have to explore and math out. For example, if we thought Exorcism did too much damage, we might lower its coefficient. Players might notice, but it would take a lot of testing before anyone was convinced. Someone mentioned the Windfury ICD above, which is a good example of what I would call a stealth nerf. It was hard to notice. Making a change so that a spell doesn't work on players doesn't really sound like &quot;stealth&quot; because it's going to be noticed immediately.<br />
<br />
There is little point in us making actual &quot;stealth nerfs&quot; with the intent to deceive, because players are going to figure it out anyway. (The WF one wasn't made recently.) What you seem to be calling &quot;stealth nerfs&quot; are hotfixes or mini patch changes that came without a GC or other blue post. But there are many of these made regularly, probably far more than you realize. Many of them will never affect your character, but some will. Some are made late at night when good developers are asleep or at blues bars.<br />
<br />
We haven't yet come up with a great way to communicate changes that come in between patches. For patches we have the patch notes. Sometimes I'll make a blue post and we've tried to get better about documenting hotfixes. We've considered trying to use the launcher or login screen for breaking news or maybe even have a place in game where you can check out recent patch notes. Again, we make a lot of these, and some of them are too trivial for most players to care, and we wouldn't want the list to be so long that players just skip through it.<br />
<br />
If you're defining &quot;stealth nerf&quot; as any change that comes in between patches or any nerf in general, well then you're just using your own private use of the term, which is a big problem with game jargon (see examples just as &quot;cleave,&quot; &quot;WG,&quot; &quot;dead zone&quot; etc.) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/24038765550-stealth-starfall-nerf-eh.html))<br />

Upcoming Revenge change<br />
In the interest of avoiding the unflattering scent of stealth nerf, allow me to post that we are going to make that change (one Revenge per proc) I suggested above. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/24038823780-probably-no-revenge-nerf-anytime-soon.html))<br />
<br />
If we change Revenge to basically be one charge then the warrior can still pop the rogue or pet or whatever that triggers the block, dodge or parry, but they'd only get one hit instead of multiples. Such a change should not affect Protection at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not fond of it for the same reason. Some of us are in not-so-hardcore guilds, but who are still capable of eventually overcoming the challenge given enough time on a shorter weekly raiding schedule, and given time to endure more roster changeups from gquits during it all, etc.<br />
<br />
However, we'd be stupid not to take whatever buff was available at the time, and lots of guilds who might've reached the end after us with 0% buffs or 5% buffs may get there before us at 10%, 15%, 20%, etc. The buff will make up for lack of skills more than it makes up for lack of raiding time and a consistent roster.<br />
<br />
I don't disagree with the general idea behind the buffs, but I think they should be rolling them out a whole lot slower. We just had the very first 25H LK kill with 5%, and the very next Tuesday they roll out the 10? Let several more guilds beat it on 5% first, please. Ditto on the upcoming 10 -&gt; 15% transition: wait until a sizeable chunk of guilds have beaten it on 10% before upping to 15.<br />
<br />
4 weeks is not enough spacing, and the final 30% buff is way too much anyways (and will be totally unnecessary once people overgear it with Cata gear in the future in any case). If they *must* go with a fixed schedule instead of playing it by ear when the right number of guilds have crossed the barrier, at least extend the schedule to at least 6 if not 8 weeks between buffs, and stop increasing the buff when Cata comes out.</div></div><hr />

Does that image mean that players can individually disable the buffs? For PUG raids (we usually only have ~20 guildies for our ICC25), we've had our share of griefers coming in for the initial trash rep and then disabling the buff on their way out. It's pretty annoying.</div></div><hr />

it's people like you who are NEVER pleased/statisfied with what they got that must bring every tiny bits of &quot;facts&quot; into a philosophical perspective and argue about every little change that happens who get on my nerves. whining and bitching, all the time, not more, not less.<br />
<br />
if you feel you need/want/like to challenge all the content WITHOUT a buff, for gods sake, just do it?! what's so hard? from you wording it would not matter anyway, because you don't seem to fight those boss because of the competition but for fun. so take your time and HAVE FUN!<br />
<br />
but no... you folks just yell your opionion out in the world of how a big bad company spoils all the fun you could have, because some people who are better (have more time, whatever..) than you take all the help they can get to achieve THEIR own goals - which are bound to to competetion.<br />

<br />
This is a most schizoid thing. So you want the buff, but not too much, but not too soon, but basically just to the pacing of your guild?<br />
<br />
Sorry kid, you missed it. If the cutoff was some other time, someone else would be bitching about &quot;we almost had it at the 5% buff&quot;. There's always going to be the dude that got the last ticket into the show, and there is always going to be the dude right behind him, no matter how many tickets there are. Blizz isn't going to magically pick your particular guild's speed to time events around.<br />
<br />
Now, for you &quot;pugs will faesroll this ZOMG&quot;... well, you should hope so. Since it's obvious you've never seen the stupid fight, pug faceroll is the only way you will see it outside of youtube.<br />
<br />
I predict, once the buff gets really high: Up to Saurfang, Rotface, Festergut get steamrolled by any pugs that doesn't literally have an 80 IQ average. Putricide gets beat by good &quot;pugs&quot; consisting of a consistent core and some lucky RNG. Putricide will be impossible for any abom driver to do correctly the first time, though, so... Putricide will be killable by some good organized &quot;pugs&quot; that have a core group that has played together, but far out of reach of a collection of guildless /2 random mob.<br />
<br />
Council gets brute forced. BQL won't be puggable. People won't get bite order right, won't spread out, hell probably won't even run together. Ugh. I can't imagine the patience of someone trying to teach a pug to do this fight. Would make Job look like Mike Tyson on meth.<br />
<br />
Sindragosa? PuG. HA! Moot point, since BQL and Putri will put a stop to those dreams before, but a pug will, if by some miracle they get through p1 all get turned into ice cubes and die. Period.<br />
<br />
We won't even talk about the LK. Damn, almost makes me wish I could enable follower camera mode on pugs to see what they do.<br />
<br />
Anyway. That's my speculation. What's yours?</div></div><hr />

I think you're correct. WotLK was released 22 months after TBC was. Mid-September will be 22 months after WotLK.<br />
<br />
We also know that patch 4.0 will likely be released roughly a month before Cataclysm so it would probably be roughly a month after the 30% buff goes live.</div></div><hr />

Some of us are in not-so-hardcore guilds, but who are still capable of eventually overcoming the challenge given enough time on a shorter weekly raiding schedule, and given time to endure more roster changeups from gquits during it all, etc.<br />
<br />
However, we'd be stupid not to take whatever buff was available at the time, and lots of guilds who might've reached the end after us with 0% buffs or 5% buffs may get there before us at 10%, 15%, 20%, etc. The buff will make up for lack of skills more than it makes up for lack of raiding time and a consistent roster.<br />
<br />
I don't disagree with the general idea behind the buffs, but I think they should be rolling them out a whole lot slower. We just had the very first 25H LK kill with 5%, and the very next Tuesday they roll out the 10? Let several more guilds beat it on 5% first, please. Ditto on the upcoming 10 -&gt; 15% transition: wait until a sizeable chunk of guilds have beaten it on 10% before upping to 15.<br />
<br />
4 weeks is not enough spacing, and the final 30% buff is way too much anyways (and will be totally unnecessary once people overgear it with Cata gear in the future in any case). If they *must* go with a fixed schedule instead of playing it by ear when the right number of guilds have crossed the barrier, at least extend the schedule to at least 6 if not 8 weeks between buffs, and stop increasing the buff when Cata comes out.<br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly, if it annoys your guild that badly, then take it off. Otherwise stop your crying. The buffs are coming, they're set in stone. All the crying you and people like you do won't fix it. Either continue going &quot;pure&quot; or stop going.</div></div><hr />

Apparently we do. We'll probably need it again at the 15%, 20%, 25%, and 30% level too. Never mind that this was the plan all along, never mind that the schedule was strongly hinted at in January, and never mind that a 5% a month increase now seem all but set in stone. A month from now people will be bitching that the buff increased. Some of them will even express surprise that it happened &quot;so quickly&quot;.</div></div><hr />

It's not going to prevent you from getting Mind-Controlled on Blood-Queen. It's not going to help you kite on Putricide or Rotface.<br />

If Beta is indeed starting in April, I would expect that patch 4.0 will be the patch that gives the 30% buff. In which case, Cataclysm will be one month after that. This assumes there isn't a serious issue that comes up in Beta that delays the launch. That would make it somewhere in August.<br />
<br />
Remember that Blizzard makes more money if they can get it out sooner. With the major content already finished, there is no reason to delay it's launch unless there is a problem on their end. It makes sense that as Blizzard releases more expansions, it would get better at meeting their deadlines.<br />
<br />
I also think Ruby Sanctum will be in the patch that gives the 15% buff. At that point, it will have been 12 weeks since the release of ICC. Then raiders will have 12 more weeks before 4.0. Then everyone will be doing troll/gnome stuff and awaiting the expansion that will be released in a month.</div></div><hr />

no, the 30% buff eventually won't make it a facerolled instance, but it sure is gonna make the extra 30% dmg or hp buff to zerg the encounter faster.<br />

And as blizzard taught us throughout all WOTLK; tactics are not important, aslong as you have high dps, tank that can take a lot of hard hits and healers to keep him up - you'll be fine.<br />

<br />
Our guild is currently 8/12 through ICC Heroic Mode and the buff has recently been raised to 10%. The reason we didn't have a chance to try out the other 4 bosses on heroic was because we were practicing and learning the other 8 fights; unlike the top 20 guilds, it did take a time to kill the Lich King on normal mode and that sets you back a lot for every week you don't kill it, even if it's only 2 for example.<br />
<br />
I believe strongly that we could have killed everying par Lich King with the 5% buff if we had at least another month which is why I'm personally apposed to it this early on in the content patch. I know there will be many guilds out there that are in the same situation in terms of ICC Heroics and will also be disappointed with the change.<br />
<br />
<br />
And about the buff being optional: it's not optional. If you want to stay competitive with raiding, you have to take that buff or you'll fall behind the ones that aren't stupid and actually use it. Theres no way of proving you did the bosses without the buff therefore no benefit. We can take the 10%, but we don't have to like it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It's not a nerf to content, it's a buff to players...<br />

It is a nerf to the content indirectly because the buff only applies in Icecrown, and therefore decreases the difficulty of the boss encounters specific to that area. If the buff applied outside of Icecrown and could be used everywhere then it would indeed be a buff to the players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Every classe is faceroll (to some extent) and you get decent numbers. As said previously, it's to give &quot;bad or less hardcore players&quot; something to do instead of staying stuck on Y Boss because of lack of dps/hps whatever...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretend they never raised the level cap and it was all level 60 still. While blizzard made it easy to get tier 9 and moderatly easy to get tier 10 that puts everyone on a (best - 1) playing field.<br />
<br />
This might get confusing cuz im tired but hear me out<br />
<br />
So now we have level 60 everything and people have to work their way up from tier 1 to tier 10, but then blizzard got tired of people getting stuck in mc so they made everything easier now everyone is in icc....however. the best guilds complete icc at 5-10% buff, while many are not going to complete the content till 20-30% buff. This is letting everyone into the content but still leave seperation of good/bad guilds in place. Good idea imo...But they should have added achievements and even a 7 seperate(a-la pvp ranks) titles to really leave a lasting feel of I'm better than them. That I feel would please the vet hard care, the new hard core, the hard core turned casual and the casual as they would all get to see all of blizzard hard work. And still get something very &quot;out there&quot; to show off their hard work.</div></div><hr />

This will not fight burnout; this will increase burnout. The reason a huge number of formely decent raiding guild haven't killed LK yet isn't because the fight is beyond them, but because people cba anymore. Trivializing content makes running such content uninteresting and irrelevant.<br />
The high end guilds who raid enough and with enough performance to fight the clock and managing to see the content in its proper form were lucky enough to get their satisfaction; most others are now fighting with the fact that nobody who is serious about raiding has any interesting in killing something with 10% to all your stats. Disabling the buff isn't an option, because if your guild was made of 30 dedicated raiders, you would be probably past the problem now (well, not really since only one guild made it with 5% to dmg); if you're still progressing, not using the buff means losing standing to less skilled guilds, which in turn will lead to losing people and that's not affordable in a time where player burnout is already this strong. On most servers there's a handful of guilds struggling with hardmodes and then dozen others not progressing anymore or on raidbreaks because people don't want to be forced to rush through content to face it the proper way.<br />
<br />
What people fails to realize is that this policy isn't casual friendly. True casuals (people who raid 6-8 hours a week) had their best time in Vanilla, where instances were left untouched for over a year; hardcores would do it first, but everyone had their chance at doing it at their own pace, without having constant nerfing or later gear triviliazing the previous content. You couldn't progress in AQ40 till you did BWL, so BWL never lost meaning, and you never had to rush through it.<br />
<br />
The new format is idiot-friendly. It opposes the same concept of guild. There's a very brief progress window for those guilds that make it in the news, then all the content has to be destroyed within a handful of weeks from release to be accessible to all the hordes of sunday afternoon puggers. The casual middleground was nuclearized. Either you're hardcore and make it within a month, or you pug it.<br />
<br />
<br />
As a last note, I've read some tool saying that doing 700 more dps on Putricide won't make you kill the boss easier. 700 dps over 17 dpsers mean 12k more dps which is close to 1 million damage a minute. That's before considering how having 10 or 20 or 30% more HP will make dying to malleable goo or explosions far less likely, standing into oozes less punishing, and tank healing far easier. 30% more healing on HoTs will make it so that every 3 healers will count for 4, and 10 or 20 or 30% more dps on oozes will make the zerg tactics trivial.<br />
Since maybe numbers will help people understand further, once the 30% buffs will be in, you will be virtually running with 23 dpsers and 8 healers, healing feral druid with 85k hp pools and prot paladins close to 70k, with shields absorbing 15k damage, dps dks and warriors sporting 49k hp and just happily standing in every single AoE the game has to offer. EVERY fight aside from LK will be puggable. BQL will be doable with a handful of vampires (and just nuking any failure), Putricide will be trivial, and Sindragosa will become so forgiving when priests and mages move from 25k hp to 35k that it will eventually go down too.<br />
<br />
The only fight that will be effectively challenging to pug will be LK, and that's fundamentally because of unhealable deaths and &quot;don't stand in the fire or autowipe&quot; mechanisms.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
I beg your pardon, but I have to disagree on your perspective on &quot;casual&quot;.<br />
<br />
To me, casual means &quot;someone who plays less&quot;, not &quot;someone who plays worse&quot;. Often the two things will overlap (mostly because practice makes perfect and someone motivate to be at the top of his game will also be someone who gives a lot of importance and time to the game), but it's not automatic.<br />
<br />
There's plenty of &quot;casuals&quot; (people who raid 6-8 hours a week) who do not want to see the content nerfed to suit them. They're perfectly fine with bosses that need 40 or 400 pulls to down. Hardcore guilds who raid 20, 30 or whatever hours a week will take a week or a month to do the same boss they will need 2 months or 3 or 6, but they're fine with that. The opportunity to tackle the same challenge at their own pacing will make both happy: the hardcore will race among like minded players for satisfaction and status, the casual will do it on a more personal level and with no urge to be too fast about it.<br />
<br />
The idea that &quot;casuals&quot; are a bunch of brainless, foam-mouthed idiots who have no other wish than to see everything doable in a couple of pulls is what has ripped apart the raiding scene in WotLK. There's a lot of people out there who wants to raid 2 nights a week and still play well enough to tackle the challenge or rank on WoL or collect their drakes. This demented nerf/aura system is designed under the idea that people will play this game 20 hours a week anyways, either being awesome or terrible at it, and they should get the same result no matter what. Blizzard will soon realize there's a huge part of the userbase who's not interested in this model.</div></div><hr />

There's a difference between 'casual' and 'crap'. If this is your attitude then I'm pretty sure you're in the second group. WoW requires a lot less time than it used to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Regarding Burnout: what burns people out is not a 5% increase on hardmodes, specially in a game that has multiple server shutdowns, login problems, goldsellers, spam in trade channels, RP servers where no one role-plays and PvP servers where no one PvPs, as our friend said: extended downtime again... As someone said, if you want to hit your head against some hardmodes I have several suggestions apart of turning off the ICC buff. You can level a character to level 60 and try to raid AQ40, even with Outland gear. You can try Ulduar Hardmodes in half T7 just as top guilds did, same with ToC. Goldshire also helps to increase Burnout btw.<br />
<br />
About the 30 dedicated raiders: You already answered that one. Do you really think that guilds like that are even close to solving the problem?<br />
<br />
Lets talk now of how Vanilla was for casuals and how burning can be to be constantly trying to find 40 people to raid. It would be really funny to know how many PuGs finished AQ40 or even Naxx at that time. Sure, casuals had a great time in Vanilla. Do you know the amount of people that first got to see Twin Emps on a 25 level 70 raid and not be able to down them?<br />
<br />
The new format is idiot friendly in terms of guild if your opinion is that you can either be hardcore or pugger. Im not sure that you understand the concept that raiding with your guild means not only loot or to kill bosses. Some of us try to have fun with friends, but then again, my concept of fun is probably different than yours. You want to SEE content? go ahead and pug it... you want to ENJOY content? go with your guild. Quite a difference there.<br />
<br />
You are not a hardcore raider but you complain about increasing a zone-wide buff, you are not a pugger because you despise them, by your comments Im guessing that you are one of those &quot;casuals&quot; that you talk about, with lots of skill but not a lot of time, which is fine with me. My advice: find a good guild with people similar to you, find your own motivation if you think that Blizzard is taking it away from you (switch roles, go offspec raiding, cancel buffs, do raids with their correspondent tier gear).<br />
<br />
When I read your post I had the impression that you are a bit confused. If you need to find challenge at your own pace I dont really understand why you complain about the 10% buff and not about the 5% one. And if you are complaining about zone wide buffs, just switch them off.<br />
<br />
Hope that was a bit more clarifying than my first answer.</div></div><hr />

If you want to kill the Lich King, grind herbs for a few hours and pay a &quot;high-end&quot; guild to bring you along. Or better yet, just start up a private server and oneshot every boss. Then you have your lore, you hear them speak and you see the death animations.<br />

The reason a huge number of formely decent raiding guild haven't killed LK yet isn't because the fight is beyond them, but because people cba anymore. Trivializing content makes running such content uninteresting and irrelevant.<br />
I can't agree here, because you can't say that content is trivialized with this buff. Some mechanisms will still be deadly, and anyway, most of the time, guilds don't wipe because they don't have enough dps nor enough heal nor enough hp, but because too many people do too many mistakes. Or just don't know what to do.<br />
<br />
<br />
The high end guilds who raid enough and with enough performance to fight the clock and managing to see the content in its proper form were lucky enough to get their satisfaction; most others are now fighting with the fact that nobody who is serious about raiding has any interesting in killing something with 10% to all your stats. Disabling the buff isn't an option, because if your guild was made of 30 dedicated raiders, you would be probably past the problem now (well, not really since only one guild made it with 5% to dmg); if you're still progressing, not using the buff means losing standing to less skilled guilds, which in turn will lead to losing people and that's not affordable in a time where player burnout is already this strong. On most servers there's a handful of guilds struggling with hardmodes and then dozen others not progressing anymore or on raidbreaks because people don't want to be forced to rush through content to face it the proper way.<br />
There are several if not many nonsenses here.<br />
First of all, it's not 10% to all stats. But I guess it's just emphasis to your point, imarite? ;)<br />
<br />
Like you point, only ONE guild has managed to finish the game so far. And there, 500(?) who are the &quot;lucky&quot; ones to be close to finish it (with 11/12 HM done). That means the vast VAST majority of WoW raiders isn't &quot;serious&quot; about raiding?<br />
And if that was true (you made so many enemies right now, didn't you?), then why would they care that a &quot;less skilled&quot; guild gets content done before them, because they disabled the buff?<br />
Finally, you say that people prefer to stop progressing because it's *too hard* and because they know Blizzard will buff them soon enough. Where is the burnout here? People completely stopping because they can't stand away from the fire, or staying until content is nerfed enough/they are buffed enough?<br />
<br />
<br />
What people fails to realize is that this policy isn't casual friendly. True casuals (people who raid 6-8 hours a week) had their best time in Vanilla, where instances were left untouched for over a year; hardcores would do it first, but everyone had their chance at doing it at their own pace, without having constant nerfing or later gear triviliazing the previous content. You couldn't progress in AQ40 till you did BWL, so BWL never lost meaning, and you never had to rush through it.<br />
Again, nosense all over.<br />
Imagine waiting until your tank has enough Fire resistance to be able to tank Ragnaros, or 15 people to have enough nature resistance for that particular AQ fight, or just having enough healers/warlocks/shamans or whatever. Massive massive burnout, if you didn't have a solid raid structure. I really really wonder how many &quot;6 to 8 hours a week&quot; raiding guilds cleaned BWL before BC.<br />
<br />
<br />
The new format is idiot-friendly. It opposes the same concept of guild. There's a very brief progress window for those guilds that make it in the news, then all the content has to be destroyed within a handful of weeks from release to be accessible to all the hordes of sunday afternoon puggers. The casual middleground was nuclearized. Either you're hardcore and make it within a month, or you pug it.<br />
Facts prove you wrong here, because the VAST (again) majority of WoW raiders didn't &quot;make it&quot; yet!<br />
<br />
<br />
As a last note, I've read some tool saying that doing 700 more dps on Putricide won't make you kill the boss easier. 700 dps over 17 dpsers mean 12k more dps which is close to 1 million damage a minute. That's before considering how having 10 or 20 or 30% more HP will make dying to malleable goo or explosions far less likely, standing into oozes less punishing, and tank healing far easier. 30% more healing on HoTs will make it so that every 3 healers will count for 4, and 10 or 20 or 30% more dps on oozes will make the zerg tactics trivial.<br />
Since maybe numbers will help people understand further, once the 30% buffs will be in, you will be virtually running with 23 dpsers and 8 healers, healing feral druid with 85k hp pools and prot paladins close to 70k, with shields absorbing 15k damage, dps dks and warriors sporting 49k hp and just happily standing in every single AoE the game has to offer. EVERY fight aside from LK will be puggable. BQL will be doable with a handful of vampires (and just nuking any failure), Putricide will be trivial, and Sindragosa will become so forgiving when priests and mages move from 25k hp to 35k that it will eventually go down too.<br />
<br />
The only fight that will be effectively challenging to pug will be LK, and that's fundamentally because of unhealable deaths and &quot;don't stand in the fire or autowipe&quot; mechanisms.<br />
<br />
12kdps over a minute is 720k damage, not really &quot;close&quot; to 1M. (But you like &quot;emphasis&quot;, don't you? ;) )<br />
And let's wait the 30% buff before we can &quot;critize&quot; it, because, honestly, even with a slow path and what not, if you or your guild didn't finish ICC by then, you should really question your &quot;skill&quot;. :) (and I for one believe that even with 30% buffs to hp/dps/heal, Putri HM and Sindra HM, will be doable only by coordinated people, too many &quot;unforgiving&quot; mistakes possible in these fights)</div></div><hr />

On all seriousness, if they just add another title like 'Hand of A'dal' or achievement to show that some people can complete Ice-crown content without added buffs it will settle some of the hard-core nerd rage forum posts. I'm pretty sure most of the hardcore raiders just want to stand out from the casuals.<br />

<br />
<br />
To you and the other several posters of this bent. I'm not crying, I'm just spelling out that it makes no sense to advance the buff on a fixed 4-week schedule. It makes far more sense to advance the buff based on the progression of chunks of guilds. 1 is not a chunk.<br />
<br />
As for &quot;take it off&quot;, for a slowly progressing guild this is extremely unpopular. Run buffless for a few weeks and make even less progress than you could have = gquits. That's just the situation a slower guild is in, you have enough problems with turnover as it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
UA revenge was definitely overpowered and I thoroughly enjoyed getting my epeen stroked by randoms as I did 16k on Constructor/Controller tanking in UK. I just fail to understand the PVP aspect of this. UA/Imp Revenge spec literally leaves you with Shield Slam, Heroic Strike, Mortal Strike, and Revenge. Two of these have a cool down, one of them is a rage-using melee hit, and the fourth is only usable if the warrior takes enough melee hits to get a block/parry/dodge. On top of this, only juggernaut is available to spec which is far less useful than warbringer. <br />
Regardless of how hard revenge hits, there is absolutely NO EXCUSE for a melee class to run up to a prot warrior and start beating on it when you know that you are enabling the warriors only spammable attack and giving him rage to use it. The same goes for the argument against the warbringer nerf, what is the excuse for not standing inside the charge range after snaring the warrior? I think in both instances it's a sad case of L2P. A UA/Revenge spec warrior would get torn apart by any caster, and pre-warbringer nerf, any good frost mage could take down any good prot warrior. It was pointed out many times during the various prot warrior PVP nerfs that it wasn't viable for arena and you didn't see many prot warriors on good arena teams. If you stop and think about why that might be, you realize that there is an easy strategy for dealing with a prot warrior, it just happens to be the opposite of getting close and smashing both open palms on your keyboard (the popular strat of the times).<br />
<br />
All that being said, I agree with the revenge nerf, although it probably would have been just as effective to just remove the benefit UA gave to revenge, the nerf still allows for the occasional unintelligent melee class to run up and light up a warrior's 10k+ hit, but it isn't spammable, which is fair. I do, however, disagree with the example Blizzard is making out of prot warriors in PVP though. Go ahead and nerf damage, for the fun in PVPing as prot for most, is more about being tough and annoying than a 6-keystroke sequence that requires 80 rage and perfect conditions to 2-shot a mage with 1200 res. When you change the dynamic from good casters having an advantage over good prot warriors to a level 78 frost mage leveling in storm peaks can kill good prot warriors, you obviously have an agenda. The wrong change was made to warbringer, it should allow intercept to break snare and charge not to because intercept requires rage and charge generates it. I'm up in the air on intervene; on one hand it is a second snare break, while on the other hand it requires a friendly and doesn't allow the warrior to break snare to get close to the caster unless your friendly is near them.</div></div><hr />

My 25man guild is in this middle ground. We've got a lot of smart players with decent gear who want to do progression, but our raid schedule is 9 hours a week (T/Wed/Th 3 hours each), and we've faced a couple of waves of having too many people disappear (RL, burnout, whatever) and ending up only raiding 1-2 nights a week here and there, and/or having to recruit in and retrain newbies on the fights as we go in ICC. Our progression status? So far we're at 10/12 on 25 regular, just missing Sindragosa by 10-15% or so (and not many attempts yet, she'll go down this week once we practice the iceblock dance a little more). LK may take us a few more weeks to nail down. We've got 1 solid 10man subgroup that raids one night a week, they're into 10H now. Our other 10man group has tank attendance problems and is still 11/12 on ICC10. For the most part our 10man runs are serving as extra practice, since in 25man gear we can stay a boss or two ahead of our main 25 raid in 10man.<br />
<br />
We're capable of making solid progress, with or without a buff. But for reasons already stated by multiple posters, taking the buff off isn't really an option. Given the current state of affairs, as much as the buff is a guild-killer, removing the buff is even more of a guild-killer. At the same time, the buff is just &quot;too soon&quot;, and it makes some people show up for raids less because the feeling of achievement and progression is nerfed when you don't know for sure whether finally getting through that last 10% of boss X was largely because of a buff increase or because you honestly got better at the fight.<br />
<br />
These buffs should be spaced out more carefully and slowly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We tried LK for the first time, 60% on the first pull.<br />
<br />
Oh and on top of that riveting gameplay, barely 20 people have signed up for the next week's raids. I'd say the buffs have caused burnout. Big time, I hate to say.<br />
<br />
My statements assume you're running ICC10 normal. You say you tried LK for the first time and got him to 60%. Well well, that's not all that far into phase 2, where the fight is actually a bit harder. Do you want congratulations for getting through the snoozefest that is phase 1? Did you get the LK kill? If not, get back in there. If you have raiders getting burned out because they didn't kill LK on the first day of pulls, they're bad raiders and need to get out. If they're getting burned out because it's 'easy', well, it's not. Not if you didn't get the kill. Try hard modes, the buff is not as applicable there, as the fights have more challenging mechanics.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
ICC10normal was fine imo and was a worthy warmup. I've been itching to start taking on the Heroic version but now I cba, sadly.<br />
<br />
Hard modes are hard. If you think you cba doing them because they're easy, you're wrong. It sounds to me like you're afraid of the challenge. I mean, this is what you sound like to me: &quot;Normal mode was too trivial with the buff, so I am totally assuming that hard modes with the buff are complete pushovers, I'm not even going to try.&quot; <br />
<br />
Also, 10 mans are trivial compared to 25 mans. Make some more friends and you'll find your challenges.</div></div><hr />

I have killed the first 4 bosses on 10-man and had brief go at Festergut in ICC. I have killed nothing else in ICC.<br />

The existence of the buff means I literally don't care whether I kill the Lich King or not, and I'm one of the players who played through WC3 and the expansion. If I don't kill it now then I'll kill it when I'm level 85 in Cata epics. If I happen to join a raiding guild then I'll do what I always do: put in my 100% during raid time, and outside, and raid until we kill him. I'm not bothered either way because they seem obsessed with making everyone kill him, thus making the achievement of actually kill him A-b-s-o-l-u-t-e-l-y W-o-r-t-h-l-e-s-s.<br />

Make it a small little boost so that it feels more like gear progression. I would also have liked to seen a reward for doing it unbuffed like you get in ToC/ToGC for 1-shotting all the bosses.<br />
<br />
I love the idea that more casual or weaker players are able to see content. Hard core and skilled players get the bragging rights of downing the instance weeks previous. We might have 35 raiders with 25 of them being quite skilled and some lesser. Increasing damage and healing lets someone who only needs LK gear sit out for someone who has been benched for Festergut because they don't have enough DPS/healing/health just yet. I like that idea.<br />
<br />
<br />
What people fails to realize is that this policy isn't casual friendly.

<br />
This is crazy. First thing, the instances were constantly re-tuned. Remember Ragnaros being unkillabe? Onyxia being unkillable? Etc.<br />
<br />
Also I HATED (as did many others) the idea that you had to do MC to do BWL to do AQ to do Naxx. Now if you could go in to said instance and totally gear up in 3 - 4 weeks that might be okay but you couldn't. It took me 51 clears of BWL to get full T2 + Crossbow. 51 WEEKS to get ready for the next raid zone. Yes you don't need full tier to do AQ but if you took on an app wearking dungeon gear (which took me 6 months to get) do you think they would be of much use to you on Patchwerk? You have to drag 39 people back into BWL or AQ and hope, really hope you get lucky enough to gear them up.<br />
<br />
This is just plain bad design. Blizzard admits it.<br />
<br />
If you're pride is so diminished by the fact that your guild that just killed LK-25 Normal is now joined by 2 other guilds on server thanks to the buff then just ignore them. I could care less what other guilds or pugs are doing. I care what the other 30-35 people I raid with are doing not the other 10,000 on the server. My fun is no less diminished knowing that XYZGuild has also downed the same content or that a Sunday raider has as well.</div></div><hr />

You make it sound like LK is laughable even with the 10% buff. 5% and even 10% is not that much to help beat heroic.<br />

Anyways, my guild is 11/12 normal 25 and I welcome this buff. The idea of the buff is to make sure everyone has a chance to beat the Lich King. Even if it ends up being cake walk with the 30% buff. It should only matter to you if you manage to beat LK before it reaches that buff, or even, just beating him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
And lol@ anyone who thinks this will make ICC fully Puggable for terrible players. All these boosts do is make your numbers bigger. And anyone who has any clout to call themselves &quot;Real&quot; raiders should know FROM EXPERIENCE that several fights have mechanics that will demand co-ordination, regardless of how Uber you are.<br />

Twin Emperors STILL wipes people at level 80. And you think a Mere buff will make these players steamroll the Lichking?</div></div><hr />

If this is your attitude then I'm pretty sure you're in the second group. WoW requires a lot less time than it used to.<br />
<br />
Sure it is. Crap is crap, they don't realize that are doing, not even bother to read skills definitions or use the one they find animation look nice :)<br />
<br />
Casual are casuals, coz we bother to understand only our own classes and how to play with others in groups. And buff is for us, coz it's boring to farm Coliseum for nice 245 parts (100500 runs to get that uper-duper trinket!!!), so we could enter ICC perfectly prepared. We are not standing near the dungeon before the raid time, but ask for summon sometimes and don't get &quot;minus&quot; for that :) Oh, and if I want to go out this week with my wife instead of raid, other players will understand that and won't kick from static raid group. In my view for casual player: real world &gt; wow and wow is just another game. For hardcore: wow &gt; real world and wow is more than just another game. And ye, I'm playing for like 4 years with breaks as casual player, and 3.x is most casual-friendly wow.<br />

Yesterday we managed to pass Professor to 2nd phase while only 1 slime killed. Without 10% buff 2 of them spawned coz of our low gear. And those 5% made 3rd phase more fast and less dependable on luck.</div></div><hr />

You dont undestand that its is true even without the buff? If you guild havent killed LK normal yet you guild just do not interested in his death. Same with half of ICC HMs. Wanna have fun with &quot; friends&quot; so dont care about progression then. Wanna have both? - Change guild.</div></div><hr />
