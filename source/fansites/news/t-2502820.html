<br />
When you reserve a name, you’ll also choose the realm you will play that character on. There are a few additional things to keep in mind as you make your choice:<br />
<br />
<br />
Players who choose to play on a PvP realm will only be able to create characters within the same faction. This means that if you create an Alliance character, all further characters on that realm must also be Alliance characters.<br />
After WoW Classic is live, you’ll be able to create up to 10 characters on any given realm and can create a maximum of 50 characters across all WoW Classic realms. This character count does not impact the number of characters you can create on the current World of Warcraft realms.<br />
Characters that were created for the WoW Classic beta or stress tests will not be available to use in WoW Classic.<br />
<br />
<br />
To create a character and play WoW Classic, you will need to download and install the client first.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Open the Battle.net desktop app and select World of Warcraft in the game selection menu.<br />
Under the Version menu, select World of Warcraft Classic. If you have more than one World of Warcraft account, you’ll see a second dropdown for Account. In that column, select the active account you want to play on.<br />
Click the Install button. You’ll see an installation progress bar that will show you when the installation is available to play.<br />
Once the installation is complete, click the Play button.<br />
<br />
<br />
You’ll need to select the realm you want to play on then select Create New Character. You’ll be able to choose your faction, class, and race, as well as fully customize your new character and name them. If you change your mind about a character and have already created your three, you will need to choose a character to delete. Please note, the name associated with the character deleted will be immediately available again to be claimed.<br />
<br />
Before you put your plans too firmly in place, we encourage you to gather your allies together to select your new home realm. If you’re looking to reconnect with your old friends and guildmates, be sure to check out our Classic Connections forum.<br />

<br />
Yeah...I mean why even try to make it succeed, if it can be ruined before it even got started. That sure accomplishes it. Whether it's by them being forced to shard all the time, or just having far too many people in the world at the same time; something that wasn't possible back then.<br />

<br />
Yes and no. The slower pacing, the grinding was far more fun in classic. But the rest... nah, don't want it back. While i would like some things from classic back (Seals for Paladins, More permanent totems for Shaman), there's a lot that was simply bad. Especially class design with their many 1 button spells.<br />
<br />
But here's the deal: they somehow still feel a bit better, because you need to buy your skills AND you played a class, not a spec. Right now we don't have 12 classes on live, we have 36 specs on live. And that's the biggest issue (along with pruning). Classes need to feel like a class, not it's own minispec. A Priest should still be able to heal decently even in Shadow Spec, a Frost Mage should still be able to use fire spells; but not as effective. And stop pruning abilities.<br />
<br />
Still: i might play it along with live, simply because of the slower pacing and because i like it, BUT: in the end you are right: Classic is in many cases far worse than live. Especially paladin without crusader strike. BC was simply an improved classic, and Wrath even more. (except shadow priest, the most fun it was in BC)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The worgen starts casting when the camera is on the right side, then rotates to the backside to finish the cast. I wanted to see the full casting animations from behind. Not the same.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, it wasnt. It just was time consuming.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Actually, some classes were just op. Think about shadow priests in battle grounds. Or warriors.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But here's the deal: they somehow still feel a bit better, because you need to buy your skills AND you played a class, not a spec. <br />
<br />
<br />
Having to buy your skills is gameplay that matters for you? To take a flight point to run to a class teacher is fun to you?<br />
<br />
Well. Not to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A Priest should still be able to heal decently even in Shadow Spec, a Frost Mage should still be able to use fire spells; but not as effective. And stop pruning abilities.<br />
<br />
<br />
But competition. And e-Sport! That does not work well with hundreds of skills you cannot balance properly. &lt;/sarcasm&gt;</div></div><hr />

Actually, the fact that Classic is closed realms outweighs everything that retail has to offer. The game will finally get back to having a server community in which players recognize other players. <br />
<br />
That in itself is a reason to play classic.</div></div><hr />

Good old pink tinted nostalgia goggles. I will ask you in 3 months if you still play classic.<br />

I'm curious to see how this plays out. If these servers hold considerably more people than Vanilla servers did, it might significantly harder for players to hold more than a few names in mind</div></div><hr />

Classic as an RPG is just better then retail. It's something you can sink time into and be rewarded for your efforts. <br />
<br />
Take pvp for example. A player that invested time to gather the items to make their character stronger have an advantage over other players in pvp. Unlike retail where everything scales (even levels which is a joke). <br />
<br />
Blizzard has tried to take esport mentalities and bring it into an RPG which should never be the case. <br />
The playing field in an RPG is never even, that's the purpose of investing time.</div></div><hr />

I agree with you what RPGs should be about. Yet, WoW Classic wasnt about it. WoW classic was about a lot of time effort for few content. Also, WoW classic could not allow you to work on something that really mattered outside of raids or premade pvp groups, last to be used to play pvp battlegrounds 13 hours a day. Or even more, if you wanted to become grand marshal. Without any other effort than being online. As like sitting in a tower in alterac. <br />
<br />
A no lifer who had spare time enough could achieve everything in WoW. A hard working guy not so much. There was a guild on my realm who wanted an unemployment certificate to take raiders to their effort.<br />
<br />
That was not just bad, it even was unhealthy to relantionships and people in charge of jobs. WoW Classic destroyed a lot of families and opportunities, and turned people into grinding zombies.</div></div><hr />

It is funny how such a small brain like yours can understand certain words like Pathos but doesn't have enough grey matter to realize that you're just being a PoS for blindly criticizing what others enjoy simply because you personally don't like it.<br />
We get it dude you're sad and angry at life and probably inadequate in a lot of aspects in life... but news flash... It is 100% ok to let people enjoy things that you don't, and no your opinion isn't wanted because you offered absolutely 0 constructive criticism and no insight as to what your thoughts conveyed.<br />
<br />
It is actually quite ironic you have Skinner a behaviorist as a profile picture yet you yourself do not know how to function like a proper human. <br />

Ahhh you mean like how classic crazies have been sh*tting on live for years not most the time without even playing? yeah id rather the community completely shits on them like we used to, giving private server people what they wanted is the last thing they shouldve caved to. They shouldve DDoS'd all private servers until they shut down<br />

I'm not being negative. My point is that Classic and Retail are essentially two totally different games. Classic embraces the traditionalist RPG aspects, making it clearly the superior RPG. Retail embraces the MMO of it all by making the game increasingly accessible and allowing connections to be made over (generally speaking) all players. They are desirable to different players, and that's totally ok. One doesn't have to be objectively better than the other, like a lot of people want to be the case.</div></div><hr />

You mean doing it during working hours for the Blizz team, rather than them dragging everyone in on weekends? No, it's not idiotic. It's much easier for them to do it during the week when they have all of their staff where they need to be, rather than trying to get everyone in during non-working hours (which is easier said than done when people plan things of their own during their non-working hours, sometimes things you can't expect or force people to cancel). If kids/teenagers are taking up the &quot;good&quot; names, then they're truly not that good in the first place imo.</div></div><hr />

Well, modern wow has softened most of the RPG elements of WoW in favor of the larger MMO scope of things. Ultimately they are far less concerned with traditional RPG elemetns, as they don't typically provide gameplay that the audience at large wants. They decided the game was better suited by lowering the barrier to entry, so to speak. By this, classic checks many more of the very specific RPG elements that retail slowly moved away from. That isn't inherently a bad thing unless those were the kinds of reasons why you enjoyed the game before. I'm not saying retail or classic is a worse game, or that either are terrible at being an RPG/MMO. They just have different overall objectives, and thus one caters more to the RPG elements and one to MMO elements.</div></div><hr />

I guess he means things like reagents (just some examples: Ankhs for shaman resurrection, portal stones for mages, ammunition for hunters) spell ranks (at class trainer), weapon skills, soul shards for warlock spells, wood + flint&amp;tinder to light a fire. <br />

<br />
Not really, back then, the leveling itself was meaningful: You wanted to look on the zone where you glimpsed in it and some imp with an skull totally trashed you. You saw more and more on the world where you couldn't go through before. Having such a slow pace helped to really be able to see the whole zone before you outleveled it.<br />
<br />
I know that is simply not the case for everyone: there are people who simply want to be max level as fast as possible, and that's nothing wrong with this. But i think that leveling could have more meaning, especially when you level up. Making the game that you simply want to be max level as fast as possible is not the right way to build an MMO around.<br />
<br />
I personally would love to see an paragon-system in the next expansion; if they don't want to make leveling not more meaningful, at least a system like this could be done to make further leveling more interresting.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, some classes were just op. Think about shadow priests in battle grounds. Or warriors.<br />
<br />
Warriors were overpowered in everything. But Warrior was simply the most complete class. You could see how finished every class was. Warrior was probably the first class they finished completely. Shadow only makes fun as long as you don't have gear. After Naxxramas Shadow was trash-tier, since rogue could instant kill them, as do Warriors. Melee was too overpowered.<br />
<br />
On the other end you could also see that there were many classes that they simply didn't finished at all. Paladin for example: I didn't knew that paladin actually gained increased aggro-buff already in vanilla, since they had before seal of wrath for it, but a tank without a taunt, melee without abilities, abilties that worked around physical damage and holy damage; where half of your abilities need one or the other kind of damage, and you can't stack both. Exactly the change of seal of Wrath to the buff shows that they knew that many classes simply weren't finished. And the multiple changes in BC also shows that too.<br />
<br />
<br />
Having to buy your skills is gameplay that matters for you? To take a flight point to run to a class teacher is fun to you?<br />
<br />
Well. Not to me.<br />
<br />
I thought the same as you when it was changed. BUT: Yes, there is actually a gameplay-element to it. Not only that leveling meaned more when you leveled slower, every PING had meaning in it. For example when you looked at the trainer and saw that you get the new skill or the new rank at level X. And more of it: when you reached the level, gaining instant gratification is not meaningful. And here yes, when you traveled back, went to the trainer, spend your hard earned money on a new skill, buy it, then finally be able to <br />
<br />
This is the difference between live and classic: Yes, was it more of a hassle: ABSOLUTELY. But exactly this makes an MMO an MMO. You need to go to the trainer in any city, you need to buy it, you need to take a detour from your leveling, but then, when you finally finished it, it simply feels more of an accomplishment.<br />
<br />
<br />
But competition. And e-Sport! That does not work well with hundreds of skills you cannot balance properly. &lt;/sarcasm&gt;<br />
<br />
Exactly. Where do we get when WoW would make fun instead of being forced the path of e-sport and making it the next big hit on twitch. Will never happen, but MAYBE, and think of the poor poor shareholders: esport = money, so grab it on the table. Ok, we ruin the game and make less money through it, but ESPORT!!!!!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Howlrunner</div><div class="date">2019-08-13, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, the fact that Classic is closed realms outweighs everything that retail has to offer. The game will finally get back to having a server community in which players recognize other players. <br />
<br />
That in itself is a reason to play classic.<br />
<br />
Did...did you actually *play* the stress test?<br />
<br />
Razorfen EU, within an hour of going live, was filled with racist comments, shouting, and general hatred towards other groups. People were ninjaing Treasure Chest, mobs that people were grouping/waiting to spawn for, and all other of standard douchebaggery went on.<br />
<br />
This was literally within 2 hous of the test server going live to the public as a whole.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, this whole &quot;community rep matters!&quot; thing is total and utter horseshit. It never mattered if you were playing at a certain level. Most top end guilds were starved for geared players, so would accept whatever twatbag applied as long as they had the experience and gear. If you were raiding at a server first/competitive level, you would have known this. The only people that &quot;Server rep&quot; mattered to, were the middle packs of fuckwits who were struggling to put together a Molten Core Raid week after week, because their tanks and healers kept being nabbed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, if you truly are captain asshat, and do somehow manage to get blacklisted? Well...you know you can literally just FUCKING REROLL. The name changes, and literally every action you have undertaken thus far is negated, because no one knows who you are again. Most scammers use alts just for that reason.<br />
<br />
<br />
Seriously, half the people ranting about community had probably never even played Classic at the time, nor actually were doing anything of actual import during the game. The ONLY players that got recognised, were the top server dudes, not the &quot;average joe monkey&quot;.<br />
Pure rose tinted bullshit is what it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Not really, back then, the leveling itself was meaningful<br />
<br />
You can see the whole zone as well nowadays, as you do not outlevel it. Beside that, no, leveling those days was not more meaningful than nowadays. It was about reaching maximum level, and the moment of the first time. The last will not return in a remake. Nowadays, everyone knows everything about world of warcraft. It is not about the game having changed that much, but about the gamers.<br />
<br />
And believe me. People will notice that classic reloaded is not what they expected. Sure, it will begin strong, with millions of players creating a char. Yet.. most, the vast majority, is going to stop playing once they discover how dull leveling was in classic and that you had nothing to do at endgame level if you did not want to commit to a group of players and forget about your real life to a degree.<br />
<br />
Actually WoW Classic even was the worst incarnation of WoW up to now, as it created unemployed nolifers who dwelled in battlegrounds to become grand marshal or who raided Naxxramas with 39 other full time addicts. And this horrible implementation is going to return? With blizzard exactly knowing how many lifes got destroyed with their awkward implementation of time investment mattering that much, combined with the drug-like character of the classic skinner boxes?<br />
<br />
Actually, i see it as a complete misconception to create those addicts again with a classic reboot, repeating the same mistakes again and make people addicts. Blizzard shows their social incompetence on recreating a gameplay of World of Warcraft which leads to a massive amount of gaming addiction and destroyed lifes.<br />
<br />
I really wonder how any of those &quot;developers&quot; is able to look into a mirror without noticing what they are up to create.. again.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I know that is simply not the case for everyone: there are people who simply want to be max level as fast as possible, and that's nothing wrong with this. But i think that leveling could have more meaning, especially when you level up. Making the game that you simply want to be max level as fast as possible is not the right way to build an MMO around.<br />
<br />
Yeah, but sheer time investment isnt that. And that is all what wow classic was about, with way less lore and quests as you have nowadays, with the need to grind at level 5x if you do not play dungeons to continue leveling. WoW was.. horrible. A drug, created by vicious drug dealers who call themself &quot;game designers&quot;. They should really be ashamed of what effects classic had to players those days.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I personally would love to see an paragon-system in the next expansion; if they don't want to make leveling not more meaningful, at least a system like this could be done to make further leveling more interresting.<br />
<br />
A paragon system would be an interesting idea, but i would repair the dull world content first. Sending thousands of turtles into the water, while having no story told doing so, and that in a hundred incarnations, without any engaging gameplay, is nothing i would call compelling.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And here yes, when you traveled back, went to the trainer, spend your hard earned money on a new skill, buy it, then finally be able to <br />

Which just asked you to grind for gold. Nothing else was the outcome.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is the difference between live and classic: Yes, was it more of a hassle: ABSOLUTELY. But exactly this makes an MMO an MMO. <br />
<br />
No, a hassle does not make a game a good game. Effort which is fun does. Well told story and lore does. Flow does. Mystery does. An execution challenge does. A mental challenge does.<br />
<br />
But hassle? Probably in the limited universe of a wow world quest designer, yes. But not in normal players minds.</div></div><hr />

I guess he means things like reagents (just some examples: Ankhs for shaman resurrection, portal stones for mages, ammunition for hunters) spell ranks (at class trainer), weapon skills, soul shards for warlock spells, wood + flint&amp;tinder to light a fire. <br />
<br />
Classic WoW really had much of those little things, Blizzard moved away from that concept more and more since WotLK. <br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah but those are not traditional RPG elements, unless adventure games are RPG...<br />
<br />
WoW was originally modeled around the D&amp;D style of RPG. These kinds of things, as well as stuff attunements, requiring resist gear for certain encounters, having access to your whole class, but specializing in certain elements, they are akin to traditional D&amp;D RPG elements.</div></div><hr />

As a long time player, since second edition of AD&amp;D - lol nope.<br />
<br />
Sure, you get your entire class but still need to specialize like madman. Reagents are almost non existent or stupidly expensive. <br />
<br />
Traditional RPG elements are - playing a role (roleplaying), character growth (even this is not neccessary 100%) and interacting with the story and GM. Everything else is optional. <br />
<br />
Gathering items and using items is a staple only in adventure games. Even telltale game have this :D</div></div><hr />

WoW was modeled after it, not copy and pasted, just like most MMO's of the time. D&amp;D is where many Western RPG's took their influence. Classes require certain items to be able to perform certain task, this is akin to needing shaman needing Ahkn's, Priest needing candles, etc. The difference is, WoW made them be consumed on use, as they adjusting for an MMO format. D&amp;D had more in depth class advancement, WoW had to reign that in for the MMO setting, but you still have that overall class/specialization identity, something retail does not have. <br />
<br />
When I'm talking about traditional RPG elements, I'm talking about the subtle nuances that fleshed things out. There were reasons your character could use this ability, cast this spell, act this way, and so on. Not to say that this is a better method than retail, as they are just two different approaches to playing the game.</div></div><hr />

No, it's not idiotic. It's much easier for them to do it during the week when they have all of their staff where they need to be, rather than trying to get everyone in during non-working hours (which is easier said than done when people plan things of their own during their non-working hours, sometimes things you can't expect or force people to cancel). If kids/teenagers are taking up the &quot;good&quot; names, then they're truly not that good in the first place imo.<br />
<br />
So you as a player, are defending the video game company because it would rather make sure its work force has a singular weekend off instead of having them work one Sunday out of the year to provide a game service for its loyal customers? As if working on weekends now and day is unheard of and ridiculous, especially in the tech business. And I created my names at like 11 PM last night, pretty sure Blizzard's entire work force weren't working last night at 11 PM to make sure I was able to reserve my names, most of the work is automated. And not every kid/teenager is a moron, but the fact only people fitting the description of children/teenagers/unemployed had first dibs is more of the principle of a bad move than whether or not I actually got no names I wanted, which is irrelevant to you because you'll disagree anyway.<br />

<br />
<br />
I get up at 5.30 and still had time to reserve a name at midnight (ok, I didn't, because I don't care, but I could have). If you really wanted a common name, you could have made it work for this one time.<br />
<br />
I reserved my name at 11 PM last night. I got home like 6:30 from work and didn't rush to my PC to reserve a name instead of eating dinner, showering and watching some TV to unwind. I wouldn't wake up at 5:30 AM to reserve video game character name, I'd rather sleep until 7:45. Just because I don't care enough to bend over backwards around a work day to make sure I get first dibs doesn't mean criticizing their day of choice isn't stupid. If it had been Saturday or Sunday, I could have had a shot at first dibs.</div></div><hr />

You can`t be a too long time player if you can`t see the similarities..The armor and weapon restricitions per class, the restricitions of race/class combos...Just shouting and crying out loudly: I came from D&amp;D...Crushed spaceship? &quot;The FSS Beagle was a Space Ship from the Galactic Federation that got lost during a miss-jump and ended up in Mystara Space.

The word what you looking for is &quot;influenced&quot;...obviously not used 1:1, but the similarities are there...too many and too much of them<br />

Of course I am. It involves more external forces that go beyond Blizzard that would also require their time to be rescheduled, it’s unreasonable. There’s zero harm in waiting until a working weekday where the people who are needed will be where they’re supposed to. I guess you’ve never had to deal with logistics when it comes to business, right? It’s a no brainer. It’s how they’ve always done it, it’s why they have maintenance during the beginning of the week and it’s why patch and launches occur during the same time too. There’s no reason for them to change that.</div></div><hr />

I work in banking and earlier this year after we bought another bank, and converted to their system, guess what? When we got all the new printers, computers, and software, we had to come in on Sunday for a couple hours to test it all and make sure it was good to go on Monday. We didn't inconvenience customers further by deciding to do it Monday morning, we came in on Sunday to test it out. It's not an alien idea.</div></div><hr />

Of course, but it’s not a massive change like that is it. It’s another launch, something they’ve done plenty of times with a certain model and strategy. It makes zero sense for them to change that when it effects very little.</div></div><hr />

Did they ever do a name reservation? Even back in 2004? I don't think so, correct me if I'm wrong if you played Vanilla. If not, then this was the first time they ever had to host a &quot;name reservation.&quot; Sure, it's easier to not inconvenience their work staff by doing it on a traditional work day, assuming it's even a lot of work at all considering people were reserving names well into the night presumably long after work hours when there was no one from Blizzard even at offices (meaning much of it is automated), but by doing so they're essentially inconveniencing all of their 18-34 customer base instead. A vast majority of us were at our jobs. But whatever, it's no skin off their nose if they do it at the most goofball time frame for their most loyal customer base, but it doesn't mean they're immune from criticism from those of us that might have wanted first crack at our favorite names that likely went to the High School Junior that doesn't have to support himself and is just home on summer vacation.<br />
<br />
Maybe it's just sour grapes since I was literally on vacation for two weeks and name reservation landed exactly on my first day back to work, but it still sounds like bullshit to me.</div></div><hr />

It's still essentially opening of the servers though, which will always have a large influx of people logging on. Things did break a little and they fixed them pretty quick, but they still need the support of their staff and external staff (such as the company that hosts their data servers in the U.S. and EU) to be ready. It's much, much easier to coordinate that on days where they know people will be working - especially as it's the summer period as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can see the whole zone as well nowadays, as you do not outlevel it. Beside that, no, leveling those days was not more meaningful than nowadays. It was about reaching maximum level, and the moment of the first time. The last will not return in a remake. Nowadays, everyone knows everything about world of warcraft. It is not about the game having changed that much, but about the gamers.<br />
<br />
And believe me. People will notice that classic reloaded is not what they expected. Sure, it will begin strong, with millions of players creating a char. Yet.. most, the vast majority, is going to stop playing once they discover how dull leveling was in classic and that you had nothing to do at endgame level if you did not want to commit to a group of players and forget about your real life to a degree.<br />
<br />
Actually WoW Classic even was the worst incarnation of WoW up to now, as it created unemployed nolifers who dwelled in battlegrounds to become grand marshal or who raided Naxxramas with 39 other full time addicts. And this horrible implementation is going to return? With blizzard exactly knowing how many lifes got destroyed with their awkward implementation of time investment mattering that much, combined with the drug-like character of the classic skinner boxes?<br />
<br />
Actually, i see it as a complete misconception to create those addicts again with a classic reboot, repeating the same mistakes again and make people addicts. Blizzard shows their social incompetence on recreating a gameplay of World of Warcraft which leads to a massive amount of gaming addiction and destroyed lifes.<br />
<br />
I really wonder how any of those &quot;developers&quot; is able to look into a mirror without noticing what they are up to create.. again.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, but sheer time investment isnt that. And that is all what wow classic was about, with way less lore and quests as you have nowadays, with the need to grind at level 5x if you do not play dungeons to continue leveling. WoW was.. horrible. A drug, created by vicious drug dealers who call themself &quot;game designers&quot;. They should really be ashamed of what effects classic had to players those days.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A paragon system would be an interesting idea, but i would repair the dull world content first. Sending thousands of turtles into the water, while having no story told doing so, and that in a hundred incarnations, without any engaging gameplay, is nothing i would call compelling.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Which just asked you to grind for gold. Nothing else was the outcome.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
No, a hassle does not make a game a good game. Effort which is fun does. Well told story and lore does. Flow does. Mystery does. An execution challenge does. A mental challenge does.<br />
<br />
But hassle? Probably in the limited universe of a wow world quest designer, yes. But not in normal players minds.<br />
<br />
You disliked wow from the beginning, but you played it because it was the first MMORPG where you could be casual - but then saying it was all about getting to Max (the not-so-casual-raider approach). Call me confused. Personally I walk away from things I don't like (if possible - and it is possible in case of a pc game or book or movie or music or ...). Yet here you are 15 years later. Call me confused.<br />
<br />
But the reason I replay again is the comparrison between Wow dev's and drugdealers. Sure Wow is build upon the &quot;reward system&quot; that &quot;triggers&quot; most people. But so is every other MMO I know of - although not nearly as bad as say Facebook. But my biggest point is this: <br />
<br />
I live in the capitol of my country, we got plenty of drugdealers here. But I've never touched any drug in my life (appart from weed which wasn't for me) despite of that. Why? Because I know drugs would be bad for me and no drugdealer will ever change my mind. It's my choice and my will is what I'm saying. Same goes for pc-games like WoW. If I destroyed my life and family because of a pc game (drug) it would be my bad choice alone. Self control and taking responsibility for your own choices is whats its all about while navigating a world of temptations (addictove pc-games. social media or actual drugs)</div></div><hr />

The entire principle of Classic is to NOT have to deal with such things. Having a fixed community without the shuffling of sharding is one of the core point of the demands, and the layering is supposed to only last the first couple of weeks. <br />
<br />
I suppose that having so few servers is to ensure that they don't become ghost towns after the initial spike (I expect a lot of people giving up during leveling too), but what will Blizzard do if the population is still too high when layering reach the end of its supposed life ?</div></div><hr />

You could use actions, abilities, spells because you learned them, either from class progression sheet or buying from a class trainer (wow).

It was you who compared wow to an &quot;evil drug&quot; and the dev's to drugdealers. Thats why I responded. If you don't like a game after a couple of hours or days ... just walk away.

Unfortunately, blizzard did not make WoW fully casual. As their developers are hardcore nerds. They only put love into components they love. And if you see how bad world content is, you know its not that.<br />

Because it was. For most. When i started, i did not give a fuck about reaching max level for some months. Just played a few hours a day. At max level, i went into a raiding guild, ending in Naxxramas at the end of classic.<br />
<br />
I hated it to have to setup my schedule for a game and a group and could not define it myself. I ran through all stages of hardcore-raider-nerdism, and if i think about that nowadays, it was the stupidest thing i ever did. <br />

Yet here you are 15 years later. Call me confused.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, today i have lost all patience for blizzard to continue on their path and their mission to create games for as many players as possible. Because if they would, WoW would have an engaging implementation and massive focus on open world content, and would adress solo players as like group players.. but surely not mythic raids or rated pvp as a focus, as like nowadays. I have also lost the patience with blizzard to implement gameplay first, also one of their missions. If you take a look on world quests, you do not really want to tell me it is compelling gameplay, or do you?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But I've never touched any drug in my life <br />
<br />
Well, sorry, but you have. It is called World of Warcraft. And it burns deep into your brain.</div></div><hr />

As their developers are hardcore nerds. They only put love into components they love. And if you see how bad world content is, you know its not that.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Because it was. For most. When i started, i did not give a fuck about reaching max level for some months. Just played a few hours a day. At max level, i went into a raiding guild, ending in Naxxramas at the end of classic.<br />
<br />
I hated it to have to setup my schedule for a game and a group and could not define it myself. I ran through all stages of hardcore-raider-nerdism, and if i think about that nowadays, it was the stupidest thing i ever did. <br />
<br />
No game is worth that.<br />

I agree I wished the world content would be about more than reaching max level in a matter of days and then be left with worldquests. For that reason (plus some more) I'm glad that they'll revive Classic.<br />
<br />
You said you were happy when you just played a few hours a day (and so was I - still am and will be again). But the moment you turned WoW into a chore with scheduels you hated it. Or in you words as far as I understand it, the moment WoW became like a drug to you.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong; I mean this in the friendliest non-patronizing way (otherwise I wouldn't respond) but it sounds to me like the real problem is more about some mechanics in yourself. Like I've said in a previous response: It's all about self dicipline and self control. If that is failing (and it can for me too of course) then the problem is still with you and something you'd have to put some work into trying to make better.<br />
<br />
Yes wow is, like almost any other game, build on the &quot;reward system&quot; that is similar to that of an addict but at least it doesn't try to hide it (like Facebook etc). Same can be said about alcohol or drugs (and lots of other things) but again; the difference lies in self dicipline and self control.<br />
<br />
Have a beer now and then, get shit-faced drunk on New Year, play WoW or any other game for a few hours a day, just don't let it control you but stay in control yourself (I feel like I should end this with an &quot;Amen&quot; lol). :)</div></div><hr />

Do i get you right that you try to blame me for all those classic addicts WoW had created? Do you really go full ad hominem at this point?<br />
<br />
Too easy, friend. Try to argument without taking me as a problem and the root of all evil, if you really seek a debate.<br />
<br />
Fact is, WoW was and even is addictive. Based on the gambling it offers. Based on skinner box effects all over.<br />
<br />
It is not my fault that all those nolifers got created during the days WoW classic was new. And i am sure history is going to repeat.<br />
<br />
it does not matter how strong you pretend to be, everyone can get addicted. Even the WHO sees gaming addiction as a real problem nowadays, and WoW is one of the prominent examples.<br />
<br />
Also, it is you who plays WoW, not me. Can you stop playing?</div></div><hr />

No I don't blame you for all the &quot;addicts&quot; WoW (not you) created.<br />
<br />
Yes I can stop playing but why would I when I still enjoy the game from time to time; <br />
I put my wife before WoW, I put the kids before WoW. I put work, friends, doing the dishes, cooking dinner, going for walks, reading books, watching movies and a lot of other things before WoW. Only if I got spare time left for a pc game I log in. A little bit of prioritizing(!) and self-dicipline goes a long way as I've said :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, i am sure you can. <br />
<br />
You know, many addicts do not know they are addicted. Cognitive dissonance often disallows them to see the inconvenient truth. So they believe in a lie where everything else has a higher priority, while they play every day for hours.<br />

<br />
That much self discipline you have not discovered yet you are already deep in the addiction.</div></div><hr />
