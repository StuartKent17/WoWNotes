Legion - 3.3 Million Copies Sold<br />
Blizzard published sales numbers for Legion, with the total copies sold on Day 1 matching Warlords of Draenor and Cataclysm: <br />
<br />
<br />
The Burning Crusade - 2.4M First Day, 3.5M First Month<br />
Wrath of the Lich King - 2.8M First Day, 4M First Month<br />
Cataclysm - 3.3M First Day, 4.7M First Month<br />
Mists of Pandaria - 2.7M First Week<br />
Warlords of Draenor - 3.3M First Day<br />
Legion - 3.3M First Day<br />
<br />
<br />
With Azeroth on the brink of destruction, heroes from around the world were summoned to drive back the Burning Legion’s armies last week with the launch of World of Warcraft®: Legion™, the sixth expansion to Blizzard Entertainment’s acclaimed massively multiplayer online role-playing game. Today, Blizzard announced that players have forged a truly formidable defensive front—as of the expansion’s first full day of launch on August 30, more than 3.3 million copies of Legion had sold through, matching the all-time record achieved by previous expansions and making it one of the fastest-selling PC games ever. In addition, World of Warcraft’s launch-week player concurrency climbed to its highest point since the 2010 launch of the Cataclysm expansion, as champions from around the world united to strike a mighty first blow against the fel invaders. But the battle has only just begun. <br />
<br />
“It’s been a thrill to see players hunting demons, powering up Artifacts, and freely exploring all the new zones in Legion,” said Mike Morhaime, CEO and cofounder of Blizzard Entertainment. “We worked hard to make this the best World of Warcraft expansion yet, and we look forward to providing players with even more content as Legion’s epic story unfolds in the months ahead.”<br />
<br />
While players are currently entrenched against the first wave of demonic invaders, Legion’s next exciting chapter is already in the works. Last weekend at PAX West, Blizzard unveiled new details on the expansion’s upcoming first major content update, Patch 7.1: Return to Karazhan, featuring a reimagined version of one of World of Warcraft's most popular raids. Players will explore a sprawling five-player Mythic dungeon, facing familiar foes from Karazhan’s past—and encountering plenty of surprises and twists along the way. The update also features a new set of quests unfolding over multiple weeks in the fallen night elf city of Suramar, as well as a brand-new raid: the Trial of Valor, which sends players deep into the vrykul underworld of Helheim. <br />

Barrage (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/120360-barrage) now fires in a tighter cone, and its visual has been improved to better show its area of effect.<br />
<br />
Developers’ Notes-- Barrage fulfills a fantasy of a wild spray of shots in a large area. Of course, that can be dangerous, and often Hunters accidentally pull additional enemies with Barrage, especially in Legion dungeons. We saw this as a failure on our part to convey what it actually does. This hotfix should allow Hunters to get a feel for the shape and size of it and build a reliable expectation of what will happen when they cast Barrage. No change was made to Barrage’s damage. We hope that this helps Hunters and their groupmates to have a more pleasant dungeon experience.<br />

did you increase the honor level required for 840+ rewards? back to 805 after seeing 840 for a bit.<br />
Works like all other world quest rewards. They are not predetermined. But your chance at better loot increases with honor level. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/773361585536372736))<br />

<br />
1st one is a metric that we've always had on expansion launch.<br />
2nd one basically tells you that we have more than 10m (MoP and WoD launch) without them taking away their &quot;we won't be releasing subscription numbers anymore).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well that's day ONE sales, and matched it's highest day one sales numbers from cata, when the subs were at 12mil. I think it's pretty safe to assume it did bring people back.</div></div><hr />

Who even buys an expansion if they're not intending to get in on the first day, realistically? Certainly there'll be substantial sales trickling in for at least the first couple of weeks to maybe a month, but they'll be a fraction of the initial rush.</div></div><hr />

Well, Cata sold an additional 1.4m in the following three weeks, which is certainly not a 'fraction'.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty sure 3.3M includes the pre-purchases. Boxes sold by day 1 includes everything that was bought on and before day 1. &quot;as of the expansion’s first full day of launch on August 30, more than 3.3 million copies of Legion had sold through&quot;<br />
<br />
The issue is afaik mostif not all players in the east (that pay for gametime in hours instead of a monthly subscription) don't have to buy expansions to play them, and they're usually around 50% or more of the number of &quot;subscriptions&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Chances are subs/activity is similar to WoD numbers by now, but we can't really know, it's just speculation.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roadblock</div><div class="date">2016-09-08, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So with Chinese having to buy the expansion like the rest of the world for the first time, it's 3.3mil <br />
hahahahahah<br />
<br />
Essentially if you take them out it's like 50% of what WoD sold in comparative numbers.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saucerian</div><div class="date">2016-09-08, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Accounting magic. These numbers do not mean as much with prepurchases.<br />
<br />

Great point. If you exclude the Chinese as it has always been for these numbers for first day, it is the worst selling expansion.

If wod had 10 million subs in it's launch week.<br />
Legion has more concurrent users in the first week than WoD had in it's first week.<br />

You're either confused or responding to the wrong post.<br />

There was a point in time they bragged about how many subs they had. It got so bad they stopped. They have not started up again.<br />
<br />
If you're going to argue that having 12 million plus subs has the same amount of concurrent players then I'm inclined not to believe you. It's possible, surely, but I am just having a problem trusting their word. It's not like they've been the pillar of honesty and integrity.<br />

You fail to apply logic yet again, did you even read my post? I am not saying concurent users == total subs.<br />

Can you give me any reason to why sub numbers would be lower in the first legion week than they where in the first wod week, while concurrent users are higher in the first legion week than they where in the first wod week?<br />

Because the WoD launch was trash, the servers kept crashing and people were so sicked and tired of it that a lot of them have just put off playing for some time (the hardcore raiders that powerlevelled to 100 in the first week are a minority). Meanwhile in Legion, everyone went different paths on release, so the servers were doing much better and people didn't crash AND people weren't sick and tired of spawns being stolen from them.</div></div><hr />

Eh. They're just going by what Blizzard is saying, and while not a specific number, it's pretty easy to look up what subs were at during the launch week of Cata. <br />
<br />
Is it true? No clue. Honestly, I don't care. It looks like they knocked one out of the park - good on them, they needed to, after the crap they delivered with WoD. These are some of the best MMO designers in the world, after all. I don't get mad when Blizzard does well. I'm not playing Legion, but that doesn't mean I can't acknowledge it's doing very, very well. <br />
<br />
And yes, they're posting these numbers - you brag about the wins, and shove the losses under the carpet. This is something they earned, and earned the right to brag about, and it's something they can use to sell to investors to buy more stock, and make the stock price go up. It's business. If you have a problem with that, don't buy stocks, because they all do it. <br />
<br />
I'll say what I said at the 10 million player windfall they got with WOD - hope they can keep them. They failed with WOD - I think they're in a much better place to keep players around longer this time.</div></div><hr />

Ignite is literally an uncontrollable, mandatory passive on all of our spells, unless you want to kill mobs solely using Dragon's Breath. Unintentionally pulling multiple neutral mobs when you're trying to just attack one mob as a clothie is never a good situation, and now they're saying it's not going to be changed. Yay.<br />
It wouldn't be half as bad if they didn't put so goddamn many neutral mobs everywhere.<br />

Don't worry! Hunters have far FAR larger problems than the radius of Barrage that are being totally ignored! :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I neither play WoW nor care for it, and I don't hate it either. As an English prep teacher, I just wanted to point out the clever use of propaganda that many companies use to gain rep. I want to help you guys see through this.<br />
<br />
In this case, the sentence is &quot;In addition, World of Warcraft’s launch-week player concurrency climbed to its highest point since the 2010 launch of the Cataclysm expansion.&quot;<br />
<br />
After reading this sentence, many players will exclaim &quot;Wow, they have higher than Cataclysm.&quot; <br />
<br />
The truth is, the key word here is &quot;since.&quot; It is used as an excluded point of reference. That means it does not include the 10 million users at the launch of Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, it also means that it is higher than Mist of Pandora, and Warlords of Draenor. So if we draft out a chart, it could look something like this: <br />
<br />
Cataclysm: 10 million<br />
Mist of pandaria: 8 million<br />
Warlords of Draenor: 9 million<br />
Legion: 9.5 million<br />
<br />
Or it could also look like this since I don't know how many post launch week concurrent users the in betweens had. <br />
<br />
Cataclysm: 10 million<br />
Mist: 4 million<br />
Warlord: 4 million<br />
Legion: 5 million<br />
<br />
The real point of this is that Legion has lower than Cataclysm, but higher than both Pandora and Warlords.<br />
<br />
I'll give another example of the use of the word &quot;since.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I have had 3 meals since today's lunch.&quot; In this case, you do not count lunch after you use the word since. This could get a little confusing when using bigger numbers but is exactly what Blizzard wanted. <br />
<br />
I hope you all keep this in mind when reading any released statements from any company.</div></div><hr />

Concurrent users is just how many players are playing the game at the same time. If WoD had 10 million players but only say (as an example) 3 million playing at one single moment, it'd have had 3 million concurrent users, not 10 million. So, Legion only needs to have 3 million on at the same exact time to be equaling the concurrent number of payers that WoD had.<br />
<br />
Legion could have 20 million subscribers but still only have that 3 million concurrent number. It could have 5 million subscribers and still have that same concurrent number.<br />
<br />
Concurrent users does not mean the sub number has sky-rocketed to any number it was before, or higher.<br />
Has the amount of subs gone up with Legion? Of course it has, it's a WoW expansion launch.<br />
Does what blizzard said mean they have exactly what WoD had at this same moment in it's launch? Hell no.<br />
<br />
It's literally PR wording that you guys have somehow taken to mean exactly what you want. Yet I'm apparently a hater for trying to point something out to you. Newsflash, I don't hate WoW. I even have Legion. Do I agree with every little thing blizzard does? No. Who the hell does?</div></div><hr />

<br />
More subs can cause more concurrent<br />
But more concurrent doesn't mean more subs.<br />
Correlation is not relation.<br />
<br />
Also they are talking about concurrent players in relative terms not absolute and we don't know what they are comparing to. For all we know they had 100000 concurrent players which is more than 99999 they had before.</div></div><hr />

I absolutely hated WoD. But, I get now why it sucked so bad. As an artist if I had to work on WoD knowing something like Legion was coming, I wouldn't have felt very motivated either. The quality of this expansion is high enough that I've forgiven the lackluster part of WoD.

That's all that matters. <br />
<br />
I've been watching the launch, and I watched the comments during the beta. I was looking for simularities to WoD. I knew something was off right away with WoD when I started playing, and it only got more common and louder as the first week went by. I quit soon after, and my feelings aligned with all of the comments being posted about the game, and that's when the mass exodus from the game really got rolling.<br />
<br />
I don't see that happening right now. At all. The vast majority of people playing? They seem to be having fun. And, that's great. But, lets wait another week. I usupect it will be more of the same - people enjoying the game.</div></div><hr />

Most of those &quot;rumors&quot; are from months ago. Every game metric site shows activity for WoW is super high right now. Any article you're seeing with that 5m number (it was 5.5 actually, and that only accounts for NA), is using that because it was the last time they reported subs.</div></div><hr />

Asia has always accounted for the lion's share of active subscriptions. If 3.3 million copies sold, you can pretty safely assume there are currently 9+ million active subscriptions worldwide.</div></div><hr />

Meanwhile in Legion, everyone went different paths on release, so the servers were doing much better and people didn't crash AND people weren't sick and tired of spawns being stolen from them.<br />
<br />
Remember that WoD's instability problems were solved the moment they added the sharding system (less than a week in). That system was all what was needed really. Us being split up into separate actual zones doesn't matter when they gained the ability to dynamically split us into multiple parallels of the same zone.</div></div><hr />

You're either confused or responding to the wrong post.<br />
Without real, solid, numbers I'm inclined to call bullshit.<br />
<br />
There was a point in time they bragged about how many subs they had. It got so bad they stopped. They have not started up again.<br />
<br />
If you're going to argue that having 12 million plus subs has the same amount of concurrent players then I'm inclined not to believe you. It's possible, surely, but I am just having a problem trusting their word. It's not like they've been the pillar of honesty and integrity.<br />
<br />
Or... you can keep drinking the koolaid. Maybe they'll bring back ecto-cooler.<br />
<br />
you people even called the &quot;hard&quot; numbers bullshit back then, so there's really no point trying to satisfy you, since it's impossible.<br />
And yes, you people.</div></div><hr />

Is flying really that important to you? I don't get it. It so obviously trivializes all ground-based content in the game. This expansion's zones are literally built around exploring on foot, finding treasures and rare encounters just off the beaten path, beneath bridges, on ledges you can only reach by jumping or climbing around, etc.<br />
<br />
I can't imagine playing through some of these zones, especially Val'sharah, for example, on a flying mount. It would completely ruin the majesty of the zone, and all of the explorable things they put in there at ground-level for you to find.<br />
<br />
WoW isn't a game about flying, by any stretch of the imagination. I get that it's convenient, but I can't understand why someone would quit over its exclusion.</div></div><hr />

And since I care about it a lot more than you, you never will. And I don't care about the convenience, flying IS my immersion in the world. It's been that way for me since level 70. Going anywhere, doing anything, seeing the world from any angle you so choose, finding areas you know other people would just ignore but you find absolutely fascinating...that's what Blizzard removed from me for no other reason than &quot;cuz we say it ruins immersion&quot;. Well, I didn't ask them for their stupid opinion on the subject. They could have even rolled flying back to 60% speed for all I care. But remove it outright? For four patches? <br />
<br />
Nope. Sorry. Enjoying the game in the way I choose is far more important to me than their idea of how I should be forced to play. Make sense now?<br />

Of course not. You're one of &quot;those&quot; people.</div></div><hr />

Shrug.<br />
<br />
The concurrent number of people is as high as the point where WoW had 12 million players. The East never paid for expansions, not now and not in the old days.<br />
<br />
So it is quite obvious player numbers are huge in this launching period, although with cross server technology numbers are even irrelevant. Masses of players everywhere. Give or take several millions :)<br />

If this conversation was still occurring during WoD I would vehemently disagree with you on this. HOWEVER, in Legion I agree wholeheartedly. <br />
<br />
I don't even think it's sunk in completely just how majestic the questing zones feel. So while I will definitely want my flight back sooner than later, I'm perfectly fine not having it right now. The Flight Master's Whistle is probably the most redeeming part for that though. The Barding's for no dazed while mounted or increased mount speed help too, &amp; I wish the grapple hook was usable in more zones than just Stormheim b/c that thing is fun. It really didn't take much for them to make no-flight enjoyable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
for me it is - lack of flying is artificial stupdi time sink - at 845 itlv im already runinging around liek crazy pulling whatever i can and aoe it down in 4 seconds - im spending 90 % of time traveling from point A to B and 10 % actually doin stuff.<br />
<br />
lame lackluster design catering only to unemploeyd people who have whole day to run around and do nothign productive in game</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kojinshugi</div><div class="date">2016-09-09, 08:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I often wonder why people who hate the game so much spend so much time reading about it.<br />
<br />
I quit for three years and the only time I posted anything about WoW in that time was to discuss things they announced about WoD and how it didn't make feel like resubbing (no flying, very few 5-mans, no dailies). Once WoD was actually out, I didn't resub and therefore had no opinions about its quality (how could I?). Legion seemed appealing to me, and the movie hype made me come back.<br />
<br />
After experiencing WoD for two months, I think I made the right call skipping it, but I just can't imagine sticking around and spewing hate, especially about something I haven't played but others have. I was having fun playing other games, instead.<br />
<br />
So as someone who quit because the game was going in a direction I didn't like, I find all my complaints have been fixed - account-wide flying will arrive mid-expansion, and they've made getting around the Broken Isles so convenient that I don't miss it at all (5 min cooldown port to nearest flight master!). There is a ton of 5-man content and they want it to stay relevant. World Quests are like dailies (in that you actually do varied PvE activities instead of endless mob grinding) but less of a structured routine. And there's things I didn't know I wanted, like the extreme emphasis on class identity. Every time my warrior crashes down from Valhalla (we all know that's what Skyhold is) like a meteor, I get a big dumb grin on my face. Suramar downright feels like a story-driven RPG. And all the reward systems are tuned perfectly, so that I feel like I'm progressing no matter what activity I choose to do.<br />
<br />
The game hasn't felt this fun and alive to me since the first half of Wrath, still my favorite time in WoW (I started mid-BC). For the people still hating on it, I don't understand what they could want at this point. Nostalrius? A time machine?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally I feel Legion is light years better than WoD, and Cat blew too. I find this new expansion to be one of the best ever. <br />
<br />
The big question is, let's see the number 6 months from now ? That will be most telling, and how healthy the player base sub is</div></div><hr />

And I don't care about the convenience, flying IS my immersion in the world. It's been that way for me since level 70. Going anywhere, doing anything, seeing the world from any angle you so choose, finding areas you know other people would just ignore but you find absolutely fascinating...that's what Blizzard removed from me for no other reason than &quot;cuz we say it ruins immersion&quot;. Well, I didn't ask them for their stupid opinion on the subject. They could have even rolled flying back to 60% speed for all I care. But remove it outright? For four patches? <br />
<br />
Nope. Sorry. Enjoying the game in the way I choose is far more important to me than their idea of how I should be forced to play. Make sense now?<br />
<br />
Of course not. You're one of &quot;those&quot; people.<br />
<br />
Agreed 100%.<br />
<br />
Legion zone design, is a rat maze, small and predictable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Apparently not what most people are seeming to think it says. Both TBC and Wrath, by far the most successful expansions to date, had far lower first day and first month sales than the expansions that followed, but each saw an increase in subs throughout the expansion as opposed to the fall in subs that every other expansion since has seen. It's perhaps healthy to remember the last sub count we got was below vanilla numbers, and not go overboard with how WoW might be &quot;making a comeback&quot;.<br />
<br />
It is, though, the most successful subscription game in history, so let's not treat it like it's the tortanic either.</div></div><hr />

They did change the subscription fee recently, but that is from paying per hour to paying monthly, just like what players from other country do.However, they still do not need to buy the expansion to play Legion, only the subscription fee becomes monthly subscription.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabever</div><div class="date">2016-09-09, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haha, I bet they would love to release the sub-numbers right now. Too bad you can't have your cake and eat it too. <br />
<br />
Mabye they get &quot;leaked&quot; in the near feature if Legion proves to be a permanent success.<br />
<br />
I don't tink they want to release sub numbers especially bc they aer now considering China in subs. The number of DH's made in the weeks leading up to Legion suggest that this is not as successful as they are making it out to be. My server seems empty.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lyphe</div><div class="date">2016-09-09, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great point. If you exclude the Chinese as it has always been for these numbers for first day, it is the worst selling expansion. I'm not surprised after the WoD experience where people have had enough. Blizzard celebrating these numbers is hilarious though. It's actually really bad.<br />
Anyone that thinks selling 3.3mm copies of a pc game by launch day is bad, is an idiot.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NewBeginning</div><div class="date">2016-09-09, 07:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why would he do that when it is incorrect? It didn't sell all 3.3 million on launch day, it's 3.3 million from the moment pre-orders/purchases went live until the game launched.<br />
<br />
Because it is correct. Video game preorders on all platforms, from all companies are only counted as sales once the game actually launches. This is the way it's always been. How do you think those Call of Duty games were breaking all those records years after year, despite being so heavily preordered?</div></div><hr />

<br />
First day sales, not first day subs. So these numbers are showing the people who purchased in the first 24 hours, not those who pre-ordered or purchased after the first time. So the 5-6 million most likely pre-purchased or waited a few days for servers to settle down.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NorthWay</div><div class="date">2016-09-13, 05:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Erm... no? I thought that was agreed upon?<br />
3M was accumulated sales up until launch. The UK PC charts had it at 3rd place first retail week, and it was not charting at all last week if I didn't miss out something so any further numbers increase will probably be from online sales.<br />
If you haven't paid for Legion - like me - then you can only play the game up to ...is it 85 now? or whatever was your last purchase. So there are droves of players not playing Legion then?</div></div><hr />
