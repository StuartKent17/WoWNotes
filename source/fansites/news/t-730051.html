Jider (http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Stormreaver&amp;cn=Jider&amp;gn=Impervious.) from Impervious (http://www.wowarmory.com/guild-info.xml?r=Stormreaver&amp;gn=Impervious) (US-Stormreaver) is back with another video!

<br />
Description from the Youtube video<br />
Right away you will notice similarities to my strategy for killing Patchwerk. The initial pull spot is at his the end of his patrol path to maximize the time I have for evade-mode intercepts after a Vanish. To eliminate physical damage from the encounter I only engage in melee range when Evasion is up and use Dig Rats and Shadowstep to kite while waiting for the cooldown. Dig Rat placement is critical as I need both locations to ensure the proper kiting path.<br />
<br />
In addition to physical damage, Grobbulus has a few abilities that I had to account for, most notably Slime Spray (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/54364). Not only does this ability do significant damage in a frontal cone, if it hits a player it will spawn a Fallout Slime which would guarantee a wipe. The Slimes are extremely dangerous due to their ability to inflict damage and the difficulties of kiting multiple mobs that move at different speeds. The method I use to counter this relies on the fact that Grobbulus will never cast Slime Spray for at least 23 seconds after the pull or a Vanish. So, in addition to only engaging with Evasion I also only engage immediately after a Vanish which will let me attack for the full duration without having to worry about Slime Spray.<br />
<br />
With the strategy set, the rest of the fight again becomes an exercise in repetition with one very important detail. The kiting path for Grobbulus is very limited due to his leash point at the front of the room and keeping him at greater than 45 yards to stay out of range of Slime Spray. Through trial and error I was able to determine the correct timings to keep him bouncing back and forth inside his room for the duration of the fight (2 hours 45 minutes).<br />

Level 85 Heirlooms (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626282702/2-cata-questions/))<br />
Note that there will be level 85 heirlooms that will not stop working at 80. However, you'll have to get at least one character to 85 to purchase them. <br />
<br />
What incentive, aside from a short leveling burst, will there be to get 1-85 heirlooms?<br />
There may not be a ton of incentive if you have a full wardrobe of heirlooms already. We will be making new kinds of heirlooms though, including some new slots. Many players also reach a point where they can't find anything else to spend badges on, so heirlooms look more attractive then. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626282702/2-cata-questions/))<br />
<br />
If they are only 80-85, they will be very unlikely to get used by anyone, unless they hit the &quot;point cap&quot; for the points used to purchase them and they have a raid to go to. <br />
They will be 1-85. <br />
<br />
Wrath of the Lich King Heirlooms<br />
The experience bonus will stop working. It's also possible they will no longer grow in stats above level 80, but you can probably still equip them. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626282702/2-cata-questions/))<br />
<br />
Pre-85 Class balance in Cataclysm<br />
We're not super worried about class balance below 85 once Cataclysm ships. There will be a short period where things might feel really chaotic as everyone (including us) gets used to new mechanics, talent trees and stat allocation. Losing any current spells is just going to be the tip of that iceberg. Fortunately, we don't think classes need to be balanced on a razor's edge for that period. Any gear you score in that window probably won't last very long once you start leveling again. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626573047/what-will-replace-freezing-arrow/))<br />
<br />
Armor downgrading in Cataclysm<br />
You will get a stat bonus of some kind if you wear &quot;your&quot; armor. You can still wear cloth, mail or leather of a lower armor type if it's a big upgrade, especially if it would get sharded anyway. But the days of Holy paladins in cloth or warrior wearing leather are probably behind us. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626182807/armor-downgrading-come-caty/))<br />
<br />
1-Handed weapons in Cataclysm (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626573044/strength-1-handed-weapons-in-4-0/))<br />
There will be Strength, Agi and Int one-handers in Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
I was more asking if we will have any strength one handers in 4.0 before Cataclysm hits. <br />
There will be that strange and wonderful period in between changing over the classes but before the world changes. That is always an interesting time, but balance will have to be adjusted in so many different ways that we're not too worried about what will happen if Str one-handers do or don't exist. You'll probably replace any level 80 items long before balance really matters again. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626573044/strength-1-handed-weapons-in-4-0/))<br />
<br />
Will there still be tank weapons since Defense as a stat is going away?<br />
We will still make weapons with Stamina and perhaps hit on them. They may not be as valuable as tanking weapons are today without defense, but that's probably not a bad thing. We won't make a ton of them in any case since half the tank classes don't want them. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626573044/strength-1-handed-weapons-in-4-0/))<br />
<br />
Will there be int one handers with spirit on them? I like swords.<br />
There will be healer weapons, but those are unlikely to be swords since 3 healing classes can't use them. Mages and locks will have no need for Spirit. <br />
<br />
Currently holy paladins have the option of wielding a caster mace or sword. Why don't they itemize a 2handed healing mace (usable by everyone except priests) or allow them to wield 1 handed daggers?<br />
The intent is that Holy paladins use a mace and shield to heal. There may be occasional more unusual weapons -- we made a spellpower fist in Naxxramas for instance. <br />
<br />
Loot design<br />
There's a bit of art to the design. On one extreme, you make weapons for each unique spec -- Frost and Fire mages might want different weapons. On the other extreme, you make say 4 types of weapons (as we often do with trinkets) and make them usable by lots of characters. It comes down to there being a sweet spot to loot design (and I don't pretend we always nail it), where you can be lucky or unlucky or you can want an item for which there is lots of competition or an item which nobody else but you really wants. If loot is too predictable then it gets boring and if it's too random then it gets frustrating. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626573044/strength-1-handed-weapons-in-4-0/))<br />
<br />
Are daggers the only fast weapons in Cataclysm?<br />
That's something we have discussed (only fast daggers), but the valuation of weapon speed is heavily tied into combat mechanics and those might still change. For example, we've been considering that nasty ICD on Windfury weapon again.... (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626573044/strength-1-handed-weapons-in-4-0/))<br />
<br />
Weapon Speed<br />
There are definitely times we talk about just doing away with weapon speed. We ultimately don't want to though because we have precious few ways to make one item distinct from another as it is. We're cool if there is a certain weapon speed that you really want because that can mean certain items are particularly desired. It's only a problem when a 0.1 change in weapon speed can trump an entire tier of extra stats, which can definitely happen. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626573044/strength-1-handed-weapons-in-4-0/))<br />

Trap Launcher<br />
Trap Launcher is replacing Freezing Arrow. The functionality is so similar that there is little reason to have both. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626573047/what-will-replace-freezing-arrow/))<br />
<br />
Spells training level<br />
The levels at which you get certain spells are changing, in some cases dramatically. At the moment our design is that Trap Launcher is introduced at lower levels than 80-85. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626573047/what-will-replace-freezing-arrow/))</div></div><hr />

They want people to level through the new content they've come up with slow enough so that it's appreciated. If they allowed the current heirlooms to work until 85, people would fly through the zones, not do half the quests, and then complain once they got to 85 that Blizzard didn't give them enough 80-85 content.<br />

From levels 1-80, you'll be able to gain a maximum of +25% XP from your heirlooms. Once you hit 80 however, you will lose the XP bonus that those pieces provide, although they said they might consider letting the items still level with you to 85. They just won't make you level any quicker.</div></div><hr />

He means that, instead of having us buy new hierlooms, the ones we have now should just stop giving exp past 80, until one of your characters gets to 85, once you have a max level, they will give exp past 80 again.<br />

Clever use of mechanics, imo. That, and it's not an ICC boss; doubtful he'll get anything more than a limp slap on the wrist for it. They may fix the boss so it can't be done any more, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Between previous expansions heirlooms is given the new itemization prior to the new level.<br />
When the items turn 58 and 67 it gain the new itemization (and by that gain 10 and 30 dps on weapons)<br />
So the question is, will heirlooms turn Cataclysmic at say 78,<br />
therefor making them on par or even superior to quest items even if the heirlooms don't scale past 80.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except they're not going to be useless any more. They'll still work perfectly fine in the context of 1-80, and you'll even be able to toss in the new types of heirlooms to use alongside them. Imagine never having to worry about getting gear.<br />
<br />
I agree with the potential for an upgrade to Cata-spec after a while, although I don't think it should be available right off. Blizzard doesn't tend to make leveling in a given expansion/zone of the world easier until quite a bit after that content it released.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I know he also uses DBM, my point is he parses those information and form a logical plan of action from it.

<br />
When it's the 10th time through the old world, it's stale getting the same old gear over and over again. Sometimes we just want to level to cap without having to worry about leveling out of our gear super fast. RAF does the same thing, you level so fast that gear-wise it's hard to keep up. Having a full set of heirloom gear eliminates that problem.<br />
<br />
There's more to the low-level game than getting the gear. I'd rather enjoy the quests and worry about gear when I'm at the level cap.</div></div><hr />

Why don't they itemize a 2handed healing mace (usable by everyone except priests) or allow them to wield 1 handed daggers?<br />
The intent is that Holy paladins use a mace and shield to heal. There may be occasional more unusual weapons -- we made a spellpower fist in Naxxramas for instance.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
That is something they really should fix. Kinda sucks to be only able to use mace and shield as only healing weps as a pala, and as soon you watch for a sword (Always hit and dps wep), you are mostly likely to get strangled, and even if you get it, it feels wrong. And when a healing mace FINALLY drops, some other healing class gets it and you are stuck with your sword that all complains about. Would not mind a 2-handed mace for healing, or a bazooka, whatever, just as long Holy Palas get some more options. :')</div></div><hr />

They're probably removing digrats from the game. Just saying.<br />

It seems that Blizzard has a much firmer stance about abusing a bug than utilizing interesting game mechanics.<br />

I'd agree with you that it's clever use of game mechanics if he wasn't evade bugging the boss to avoid the mechanics of the boss. While future encounters may not be setup to tether the boss as far from their encounter room it makes me wonder why this guy bothers trying this so much, especially when he can very easily get banned.<br />

I like how blizzard banned ensidia for saronite bombs and dont give a shit about the rogue :) (not that i am defending ensidia, neither i am a fanboi)<br />
<br />
The only reason I think they don't is because it's an old boss that no one cares about. He's about the only person even in Naxx other than people there to do the weekly. Though I don't agree with it, why would it matter if someone is evade bugging the Lich King or a level 60 encounter, the encounter shouldn't define whether it's worthy of a ban.</div></div><hr />

You're making demands based on one extremely overgeared rogue spending time playing... If he wasnt doing this he probably wouldnt be playing as much. Less time playing = more chance to quit.<br />
<br />
So this one rogue likes to screw around in a raid that is not relevant... So blizzard should do work to lose one player? So they should spend money to LOSE money? You aren't going to quit because someone can do this... so whats blizzards motivation again?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think because they've heard the complaints of people saying they are having a hard time finding room for all these abilities that we have as is, and that with adding more abilities it'll make things that much more difficult. Yes, they could do for Hunters what they did for Paladin Judgements (split old Judgement into 3 separate ones), but think how much room all those traps would take up: normal version of each trap AND launched version of each trap.<br />
<br />
Or, think of it this way: why have Nature's Swiftness when you could have an instant cast version of each affected spell with a shared CD in addition to the regular spells. It's the same concept, casting &quot;1 spell to cast another&quot;, but there's just no room.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fizyx</div><div class="date">2010-06-27, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd agree with you that it's clever use of game mechanics if he wasn't evade bugging the boss to avoid the mechanics of the boss. While future encounters may not be setup to tether the boss as far from their encounter room it makes me wonder why this guy bothers trying this so much, especially when he can very easily get banned.<br />
<br />
<br />
You have no idea what you're talking about. He doesn't evade bug the boss at all. His strat in no way involves evade bugging the boss, and it would have made it impossible for him to complete if he DID evade bug the boss. When a mob is evade bugged, its health resets. That's not what's going on here. Jider is actually dropping combat, and then getting back into combat again before the boss fully resets. Did all the people who did the same thing to get the Less-rabi achievement get banned? No. Blizzard got around things like this on bosses by making bosses despawn when they leave combat... but Naxx bosses DO NOT DESPAWN ON LEAVING COMBAT. This is clever use of game mechanics, and has NOTHING to do with evade bugging the boss.</div></div><hr />

But I'm just wondering, why has Boub only posted about the 2 solos Jider did (which were awesome), and not any other solo? There have been solos of other Naxx bosses (like Heigan the Unclean) and other WotLK raid boss solos (like Sartharon), but no mention of them (which were done without exploiting).<br />
<br />
Probably because they were done by a dps Blood DKs, which isn't very creative.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He evade bugs the boss, that may not be the correct term for it, but basically he resets the boss but engages him again before he completely resets. Regardless, it's not how the encounter was designed to be done and completely negates the mechanics of the encounter. If people are going to be banned for doing so in other 'more important' encounters just because they're the most current raid tier then he should be as well for this. Just because he came up with a clever way of doing it doesn't mean he didn't bug out the encounter.<br />
<br />
It'd be one thing if this was a hunter kiting it across the instance, but this is using the poorly designed leash mechanics of Naxx to allow the boss to reset, even if it's not completely reset, to completely avoid the mechanics of the fight. Just because it was difficult to do doesn't mean he should be allowed to do it.<br />
<br />
Either way, my only point with all of this is blizzard needs to be more accurate with how they judge such things as ban-able or not. Just because it's content that no one does anymore isn't enough to not be banned.</div></div><hr />

I read of exploits, abuse of boss mechanics, evasion bug, complete waste of 2h45 minutes, and requests for bans because of that video. <br />
<br />
I've been playing WoW for a while, and to anyone that has obtained the title &quot;The Patient&quot; you will perhaps agree that the average WoW player is impatient, selfish, lazy, and often quite mean. I guess it all gets a lot easier behind the safety of your anonymous internet connection.<br />
<br />
As it was developed in other posts on the subjects, in an MMORPG, any individual that tends to stand out of the mass will be frowned upon, by the rest of the community. If you are doing something out of the ordinary, and make it public, you will get more criticism than encouragements. I have not experienced this for myself, however this seems the be a valid statement, based upon most achievements that at least I could read about over the various WoW blogs. <br />
The motivation for my post has to do mostly with respect. You see, I do not play a Rogue myself, and I do not have any in-depth knowledge of this particular fight. I did it back then, with my guild, like most of us. And moved on. <br />
<br />
Now this guy shows up and kills a Raid Boss that was meant by the designers to be killed by 25 people. In a certain level of gear. And he does it alone. Therefore, he stands out of the crowd. <br />
<br />
For the folks that have taken the time to write one of the rude comments posted earlier, I wish you could ask yourself the following questions:<br />
Can you keep the same level of concentration that he showed for 2h45? How many BRB, D/C, soz afk 2 mins, did you do in your last Raid? <br />
Have you ever done something that a large majority of the player base is not able to do?<br />
Have you made a video out of it? Posted it on You Tube? Had more than 10 hits on it? Not counting your own?<br />
Who are you to judge of the way Jider decides to spend his own free time? And be rude enough to call it a waste of space? Does that space belong to you in the first place?<br />
Are you a WoW game developer, and therefore have the right to judge if he cheated or not?<br />
<br />
I believe it takes a lot of skills and endurance to do what he has done. I believe I don't have the passion, dedication, and probably talent, to do something that gets even close to that. Nor is that a goal I wish to pursue, because I have other priorities that doing solo bosses. <br />
<br />
Regardless of your own opinion about this video, do you really think you are being respectful to the guy for what he wanted to show us? <br />
As respectful as if you had to tell what you wrote face to face? <br />
<br />
I doubt it.</div></div><hr />

You can call it clever but its really not that clever, he can only solo 2 bosses by abusing a pathing to reset his cooldowns, and slowly chip away. Its not something only he can do or something that takes alot of SKILL to do. All it requires is timing and waiting while slowly chipping away at a boss. Anyone can do it if they know the timing its not like omfg this kid is doing something so amazing no one else can do. <br />
<br />
Im sure he messaged Boub to put it up on here or got a fanboy to message boub to put it up here. Idk why boub is actually putting it up here because its glorifying someone for something that really shouldnt get much attention or praise at all. If bosses could still &quot;port&quot; their target to them like they used to be able to do awhile back if the target was unhittable (on a cliff etc) or too far, he wouldnt be able to do this because as i said its really just an abuse of poor pathing.<br />
<br />
Kinda funny to see everyone defending this guy when in reality it is exploiting even if a majority of it is using &quot;clever&quot; mechanics (which its not even using clever mechanics its timing his moves vs the bosses moves and abusing pathing as i said before). And im pretty sure the grob video was already on the frontpage a few days ago cause i remember seeing it and the patchwerk on here.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Personally id rather see and would find it more skillful to see people 5 manning the 25 man bosses doing it the legit way. I mean that would atleast be more interesting then this kids videos. Like watching the first 3 drake sarth burn video before the first drake landed, was like WOW because at the time it wasnt something people thought could be possible to do with the current gear etc.</div></div><hr />

seems like a waste of time if you ask me, what in-game benefit did they gain from this? err nothing and I don't think it deserves praise either, 80% of wow players are addicted to the game and this is just one extreme example, days if not a few weeks it must have taken to &quot;work&quot; all that mechanics out.. and for what? It doesn't impress me at all that video and in fact makes me sick that a human has wasted hours on this to in the end gain nothing.. i dread to think if they'll do another one.. the poor soul.<br />
I'm in no way jealous of this as I wouldn't even bother my time doing something so tedious or similar.<br />
I mean come on.. get a life outside of the game instead of wasting it on doing something which to be honest is just sad.<br />

He actually wasted a lot more than 3h since he had to think about ways to beat certain encounter mechanics, he had to practice, he was probably doing mistakes and had to start over so lets give him 20h for all of it. So he wasted 20h of his life. He is so sad. <br />
<br />
Time can not be taken back, as we all well know, so we should all do our best to help him organize his time better in the future so he wouldn't waste it like he did. The time he wasted could have been better spent on doing a lot of daily quests, which are done on daily basis, and therefore are called dailies. By doing the same quests day after day after day, he would have learned them well and would start enjoying them the more repetitive they become and eventually fun would ensue. They would not be as boring, tedious and a chore as they were when they were new. <br />
<br />
As an additional benefit of doing dailies (other then the immense fun factor) you gain moderate amount of gold. That gold stockpiles in one or more of your characters as time passes and you use that gold in many different ways, all of which are fun. For one, you can use the gold to buy consumables which you will use in raids in which you will kill the same boss for 77th time using the same tactics 77th time in a row with the same people you did it 76 times before, all of which love doing dailies just as you which makes this hell of a lot of fun and gives you distinct sense of accomplishment. And maybe an item upgrade which would improve your stats and therefore improving your effectiveness in the raid when killing the boss for 77th time making the encounter shorter, and consequently the raid itself, which in return gives you more time to do dailies which is always fun.<br />
<br />
The other way of using the gold is to buy an item for your character which would net the same results as getting a drop from the boss, except you will have to spend gold and therefore you will need to do more dailies to make up for the spend gold which is always fun.<br />
<br />
So hypothetically, with gear lvl =&gt; infinite, raid time =&gt; 0, in translation, while gear level is nearing infinite value, in return, raid time is nearing 0 which means, the better the gear is the less time we spend raiding and more time doing dailies, which is always good and fun, and in some theoretical infinite point of gear level, raiding time would be 0 therefore all our time would be spent on doing dailies, an explosion of fun. But Blizzard is well aware that there is something as having &quot;too much fun&quot; and because they care for their customers they invented timesinks via raids and instances and set a tight daily quest quota. Although i do not agree with their decision, i partially respect it, because i am partially interested in my well being and a lot more in doing dailies.<br />
<br />
I am sorry, i was getting ahead of myself. Speaking of dailies always has me wired! The point i was trying to get across is that there is a right way to play this game, which is described above and everyone should do it exactly as noted because that is fun. <br />
There is also the other way to play it which is wrong. Jider plays it wrong. He did something that has never been done before, by anyone, and he wasted 20h doing it.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lemons</div><div class="date">2010-06-27, 11:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizz isn't going to ban him, the whole reason his strat works is because he can shadowstep that Unconscious Dig Rat so if they really wanted to stop him they'd just break that mechanic and there'd be no more soloing raid bosses in this fashion. <br />
<br />
PLUS Grobbulus and Patchwerk are pretty special cases, because in most raid scenarios you're fighting in the middle of a big, flat room and there's no platforms to jump up on/down from. <br />
<br />
PLUS 2 hours and 45 minutes is a long time for whatever gold and epics (which would simply be vendored for gold) that Grobbulus would drop. You could make a lot more money if you spent that time doing dailys or farming herbs/minerals and that's not even accounting for the undoubtedly multiple times he failed the encounter, so the repair bills alone would outweigh whatever gain there is to be made, plus there's the cost of all the consumables he used. It's just a prestige kill.<br />
<br />
Point is...they're not going to ban him...they didn't ban him for the first one, and they're not gunna ban him for this one.</div></div><hr />

Answer 1: Because its cheating! Its unfair! And although it doesn't personally affect me in any way, shape, or form, I am so angry! <br />
My Response: Unless you got banned for attempting to do the same thing, there is absolutely nothing for you to be so mad about.<br />

I'm going to assume so many people are mad at Jider due to the fact he puts so much self gratification in his videos, going as far as to make a youtube account so he can solely upload his &quot;accomplishments&quot;. Jider clearly plans on expressing his &quot;greatness&quot; to the world prior to even attempting these fights, thats the difference between him and a normal player who may or may not have a shot at this kind of stuff. I will admit the first video (as full of bullshit as it was) was interesting because of his technique, but now to go and make a second one, with the same fluff and self gratification? Clearly someone needs his e-peen stroked.<br />
<br />
You seem to enjoy defending him and congratulating him, so I suppose its left up to you and many others who seem to miss these tiny details that make Jider so very annoying.</div></div><hr />

There's a bit of art to the design. On one extreme, you make weapons for each unique spec -- Frost and Fire mages might want different weapons. On the other extreme, you make say 4 types of weapons (as we often do with trinkets) and make them usable by lots of characters. It comes down to there being a sweet spot to loot design (and I don't pretend we always nail it), where you can be lucky or unlucky or you can want an item for which there is lots of competition or an item which nobody else but you really wants. If loot is too predictable then it gets boring and if it's too random then it gets frustrating. <br />
<br />
It would be cool if the raid weapons would slightly differ depending on the class and/or spec that is wielding it. :cool:</div></div><hr />

Judgment shouldn't be rendered on whether or not the encounter is relevant for progression guilds. If a player hacks a player hacks, it doesn't matter what they hacked they still hacked and are ban-able because of it. Thinking that the relevance of the encounter should be the judge of whether a player is banned or not is stupid.</div></div><hr />

Armor downgrading in Cataclysm<br />
You will get a stat bonus of some kind if you wear &quot;your&quot; armor. You can still wear cloth, mail or leather of a lower armor type if it's a big upgrade, especially if it would get sharded anyway. But the days of Holy paladins in cloth or warrior wearing leather are probably behind us. (Source)<br />

However, that is what Blizzard uses to enforce banning players. If the content isn't the current tier then they don't seem to care.<br />

As for the Hodir HM incident I take that as Blizzard pretending it didn't happen because they were too harsh with the timer and some guilds had already killed him anyway.</div></div><hr />

You can call it clever but its really not that clever, he can only solo 2 bosses by abusing a pathing to reset his cooldowns, and slowly chip away. Its not something only he can do or something that takes alot of SKILL to do. All it requires is timing and waiting while slowly chipping away at a boss. Anyone can do it if they know the timing its not like omfg this kid is doing something so amazing no one else can do. <br />
<br />
Im sure he messaged Boub to put it up on here or got a fanboy to message boub to put it up here. Idk why boub is actually putting it up here because its glorifying someone for something that really shouldnt get much attention or praise at all. If bosses could still &quot;port&quot; their target to them like they used to be able to do awhile back if the target was unhittable (on a cliff etc) or too far, he wouldnt be able to do this because as i said its really just an abuse of poor pathing.<br />
<br />
Kinda funny to see everyone defending this guy when in reality it is exploiting even if a majority of it is using &quot;clever&quot; mechanics (which its not even using clever mechanics its timing his moves vs the bosses moves and abusing pathing as i said before). And im pretty sure the grob video was already on the frontpage a few days ago cause i remember seeing it and the patchwerk on here.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Personally id rather see and would find it more skillful to see people 5 manning the 25 man bosses doing it the legit way. I mean that would atleast be more interesting then this kids videos. Like watching the first 3 drake sarth burn video before the first drake landed, was like WOW because at the time it wasnt something people thought could be possible to do with the current gear etc.<br />

back at lvl 70 i was doing the AQ opening quest chain. i could farm the packs of green dragons for the fragments of nightmare's corruption solo as a tank. it was very tedious because of the very low dropchance they had back then and the respawn of the packs i could solo. so one day a friend of mine who played a hunter was bored too and we decided to pull a pack of green dragons from seradane in the hinterlands to IF. he kited and i ran beside him to occassionaly taunt when things got tight.<br />
<br />
end of the story: i looted the fragment in front of the bank in IF from the first dragon that got that far (some resets in the tunnels around dun algaz)<br />

this would have made a far more entertaining video than the one with grobbulus ^^</div></div><hr />

Which I completely disagree with. It's stupid to see someone doing this in Naxx and them allowing it while progression guilds who are under pressure of getting world first pushing themselves to the max in this game get banned. I'm not defending anyone who cheats, but the whole bs of this guy being allowed to do this simply because it's Naxx that no one cares about is stupid. Avoiding boss mechanics by resetting the encounter is exploiting and it shouldn't matter what encounter it is.</div></div><hr />

He was in a Realm First/Top 30 US guild (&lt;Impervious&gt;, broke up a few months ago) since 2005. If any of you have raided seriously for that long, then you probably understand his reasons for doing this. If not, just keep in mind that he has been raiding alot longer than you and had bleeding-edge progression in pretty much every instance ingame, maybe he just wanted to try something different.<br />

This is the one word that should explain everything.<br />

Furthermore, this, and maybe future stuff yet unfound, opened up to Blizzard how mechanics can be used when in tandem with others create possibilities that they would not have thought of, and with that in mind, keep an eye out for future relevant content.<br />

Personally I get confused on this one concept regarding the kill though. Either you get out of combat during the fight and the mob evades and heals completely <br />
OR<br />
you stay in combat and he enrages and wipes you after approx. 10-15 minutes<br />

I'm guessing there is a bug with rouges around that issue?<br />
