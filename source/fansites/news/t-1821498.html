Patch 6.2 - I Found Pepe! (Or Not!)<br />
Everyone's &lt;span title=&quot;or least favorite&quot;&gt;favorite bird&lt;/span&gt; got some new costumes and an achievement (I Found Pepe! (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/10053-i-found-pepe)) in Patch 6.2. <br />
<br />
Interestingly, we haven't come across anyone with the achievement yet. There also have been no new Pepe NPCs (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs?filter-search=pepe) added to the database so far.<br />
<br />
So far, 1.31% of players have the What A Strange, Interdimensional Trip It's Been (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/9838-what-a-strange-interdimensional-trip-its-been) achievement, up from 0.41% when we checked back in May.<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Lore<br />
Probably dark shamans were in training until 5.3. Reasons similar to why he used other Horde races, I guess.<br />
Garrosh got crazier and more xenophobic after he brought the heart back to Org, influence of the old god (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/619937476145053700))<br />
didn't say he was immune due to the Divine Bell or some other Mogu method?<br />
Divine Bell was destroyed during Breath of Darkest Shadow iirc (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/619940930154446848))<br />
yes, but unless I misread the tweet, it was said that caused Garrosh to wield the heart without corruption<br />
He didn't get corrupted... at first. OG's can still mess with you mentally, e.g. your heart will explode. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/619949064717664256))<br />
<br />
Hey Muffinus, I recall you stating that fel magic uses souls, so would fel magic be both a form of chaos magic and soul magic?<br />
Some chaos magic does, some doesn't, some shadow magic does, some doesn't, it's like a reagent for some spells, e.g. Soulburn. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/619952369724362752))<br />
<br />
Reputation / Questing<br />
Personal, frequent, weekly story helps hide the grind. Is that difficult to include, and might we expect more next expansion?<br />
Ah, I normally try to avoid game specifics like that. I don't want my personal twitter to be another source of WoW news. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/619732666338795520))<br />
Yeah, we love making the more crafted story pieces to punctuate the max-level experience. We're aimed at more and better. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/619732737180590080))<br />
Difficult might not be the right word, but it's fair to say that they take time, so there are limits to how many we can craft. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/619732830801637376))<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
While the developers have been pretty quiet since @WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/with_replies) appeared, Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Developer Communication<br />
Why is the person it's easiest to get answers from regarding past and present WoW design philosophies someone who no longer works for the company and should be answering Qs from a much larger player base about an entirely different game?<br />
I answer the questions I get. I think a lot of WoW players still know who I am and League players are still discovering how to reach me. I'd much prefer to talk about League. <br />
<br />
is communication from one person on a big game design team better or easier for designers interacting with players?<br />
Personally, I think it's better when everyone communicates. That's the Riot strategy. I think it feels authentic to players (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610819080019275777))<br />
I can also see why some prefer to use one person. Keeps other people from saying stuff you shouldn't say. But that also puts<br />
My entire department is encouraged, if not required, to get out there and talk to players. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610821104597233664))<br />
I'd rather just clarify when someone errs than have a system designed to be so rigid that nobody ever makes a mistake. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610820694461448194))<br />
<br />
Game Design<br />
&quot;I could stay after work and make this a good game... Naaaaah.&quot; *faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaart*<br />
It's typically more &quot;I could fix this UI bug that happens in 0.5% of 5 year old graphic cards or I could add a new feature.&quot; (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610510409712340993))<br />
<br />
My professional opinion is that success has less to do with features and more to do with where the players are. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/605824062678392834))<br />
Right because players just mindlessly migrate, they don't care about things like &quot;features.&quot; God you are thick.<br />
It's not mindless at all. They tend to go where their friends are, and the switching cost of large groups of friends is high. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610511011406188544))<br />
This is not restricted to video games. History is full of better products that couldn't convince users to convert to them. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610511164011737090))<br />
OTOH, users will convert to new things that they didn't know they needed before. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610511280185552896))<br />
So my point was 'tis better to create a new niche than to try and shove someone out of an existing one. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610511394413285376))<br />
<br />
Do you think the constant queueing up and convenience system that WoW has now is better for an MMO? Should travelling exist?<br />
I have a love/hate relationship with queueing for any game, even League. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610819394956996610))<br />
Queuing provides an easy excuse not to make or play with friends. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610819606962253824))<br />
It also gives players motivation not to resolve problems since everyone is replaceable. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610819895106777088))<br />
And yet! So few players would play a game like League or WoW if we forced them to manually build a group. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610820023884513280))<br />
I know that's a cop out answer but I think about this a lot. At best you can provide better rewards for premades. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610820224946847744))<br />
Yet premades already come with a lot of inherent bonuses and it's still often too inconvenient. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610820368006184960))<br />
<br />
At the time you left WoW, comparing to the WoTLK days, was there a difference in the level of passion that the blizzard game designers had? I feel that over time they have grown less passionate and even complacent, and the result glaringly shows in WoD.<br />
I didn't notice a difference in passion from my point of view. Those guys pour their soul into their work. I'm not up to speed on the design so I really don't feel like I can comment, but I wouldn't try to interpret it as the developers not caring. They care very much. Disappointing you kills them. <br />

Another interesting thing came up while I was getting data ready for another post. One player managed to earn Naval Mechanics (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/10166-naval-mechanics) somehow, even though several of the items required aren't in the game.</div></div><hr />

Oh glob...and here is a prime example of why the game sucks as much as it does now.<br />

ONCE AGAIN - nobody is holding a gun to your head and forcing you to do these things. If you feel SO compelled to gain these extra rewards don't blame Blizz. Blame yourself for having zero self-control.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure those random traits that pop up saying &quot;Increases success when on a mission with (random ship)&quot; don't count.<br />
Yeah you can get them on your ship by pure luck, but i'm not getting credit for the achievement when it happens.<br />

As chaud mentioned above what you are referring to are traits, not blueprints. Blueprints are what the mobs will drop so you can purchase them later. The achievement specifically says blueprint. If traits counted then I would have it as well, but none of the traits are checked off and I have had each one.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Eh, I've had the same result as I did in Wrath. Constant wipes, tanks dying, healers terrible, me still doing 40-50% of the overall damage per fight, etc. Granted I have Legendary Meta from MoP, Legendary MoP cloak, Shadowmourne, 2 set bonuses (+20 strength / 5% damage on Exo) and some gems. Even then though it seems stupidly out of proportion than what it should be.</div></div><hr />

I'm having a ball since I'm able to tank them on my pally when back when it was on level I was &quot;stuck&quot; on a warrior... but I'm using them to get back into tanking since I know the dungeons and can just worry on remembering how to tank. Only difficult group I had was a very low dps group. Took us 5 minutes to kill the first trash pack in Lighnting halls. Maybe not five minutes but it was slowwww.</div></div><hr />

That said, I don't find timewalking dungeons particularly fun. As a tank, the only thing that makes 5 mans enjoyable nowadays is seeing how far you can push yourself. This is impossible because of how the mobs are tuned, if you pull more than a couple of packs at once, you will die and no amount of optimised gear will stop it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's because Wrath dungeons weren't built upon the idea that we have now. It was obtaining uncrushable and block as many hits as you possibly could while mitigating magic damage if possible.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Yeah, that part didn't make sense. I believe we even had better than 160 gear at the time when we started. Though I know all Wrath gear has it's correct levels. Example - You wear a 264 piece it'll still be 264 instead of 160.</div></div><hr />

<br />
GM's also don't know everything and assume stuff. They've been wrong multiple times. Pretty sure if it can't be found through datamining (going through the data files themselves) then it's not in game since it can't be there if it doesn't exist in files. Unless they just completely renamed it wrong, but even then something would show up.<br />

<br />
Yes, in this regard the runs were hilarious! Been topping damage meters with both my mages (one about 700 ilvl, the other level 98/99 at that moment) and have had quite a blast because I knew what to do and because I was quite indepentent of healers. On my monk tank, which also happens to be my worst geared Horde toon (except for a decent crafted weapon with 3 upgrades), these 5 runs have turned into a desaster. Halls of Lightning was especially frustrating because people were to dumb to handle the trash before the 1st boss and to handle the 1st boss and Lokens ongoing damage / lightning nova (it's hard to follow one simple command...)<br />
<br />
Anyway, this also proved another thing for me: Nostalgia is bad. In an evolving world, you cannot recreate past experiences, because the setting changes, the rules change, and you also change. Sadly, most people just are not able to comprehend this simple fact.</div></div><hr />

The downside was that I got Gundrak twice, and the Nexus twice. The other was Halls of Lightning which I though might give us a few problems. My groups got through them all very efficiently and without wipes. <br />
<br />
What struck me about them was that some abilities didn't seem to scale consistently ... things you wouldn't expect to hit hard, given what other abilities were hitting for, were surprisingly deadly.</div></div><hr />

Right, cause how lucky are those DK's that can spend 40 minutes killing a world boss by themselves, when I gotta queue up in a group and kill him, and it takes a total of 5 minutes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thing is if it wasn't for the chest / seal then I'd say only about 5% of the people doing them now would still do them. There's no point in queueing for them and doing them if you get basically nothing. The gear is terribly optimized and has one secondary stat most of the time and excludes Versatility and Mastery making the 650 Balefuls a lot better than them despite being 10 item levels behind, plus you can upgrade them to 695 later.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vladimeir</div><div class="date">2015-07-20, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, that part didn't make sense. I believe we even had better than 160 gear at the time when we started. Though I know all Wrath gear has it's correct levels. Example - You wear a 264 piece it'll still be 264 instead of 160.<br />
<br />
<br />
Normal level gear was 163. Heroic Ilvl was 200. When first reaching 70, all the heroics were obviously done with crafted gear and gear &lt; ilvl 163.<br />
<br />
I think LFD made the minimum requirement for wotlk heroics 163.<br />
<br />
Being a realm first player who pretty much hit 70 and went straight into heroics, it'll take players time to get use to (actually having to use mechanics) but is completely doable and not that difficult. 160 is probably still low imo, but they probably lowered it because of the class changes since then.<br />
<br />
Plus, as you said, wrath gear works. That in my opinion makes it a little more fun because all my transmog stuff has a use again for min-maxing!<br />

Yeah, just looked it up. Normal mode loot for the following:<br />
<br />
The Nexus: 159<br />
Ahn'kahet: The Old Kingdom: 167<br />
Gundrak: 179<br />
Halls of Lightning: 187<br />
Utgarde Pinnacle: 187<br />
<br />
Heroic Dungeon Loot: 187<br />
<br />
So yeah, they downscaled our gear to 160 which is just 1 point above regular nexus. While we run heroic dungeons that should be at least 187ish since that's about what we were in after quests and running the regular modes (granted some irregularities from higher players). So this change in item level is completely weird. Sure it may not seem like a big deal but for some classes those 27 item levels can make a difference. Takes with more stamina/avoidance go a long way in some of these dungeons for tanks. Especially to those who die in a 2 pull while I take as ret (oh how fun it was back then too /sarcasm)</div></div><hr />

Yea, I actually realized I mis-calculated the normal instances and looked them back up again. I forgot that it wasn't normalized then and I used Azjol'nerub as base. (I did think that 163 -&gt; 200 was quite a large gap though lol)<br />
<br />
I'd definitely say the 30 ilvl difference is huge for tanks mostly. It was tested though and I guess the input was the dungeons were alright.<br />
<br />
Also, BT gear was ilvl 141/151 and Sunwell was 154/156/159/164.<br />
<br />
Dying in 2 hits isn't fun at all and neither is the resulting wipe but plowing through it as if we were all back in Icecrown gear isn't necessarily fun either.</div></div><hr />

TBC's I don't remember offhand because I only did 2 of those and quit because I was already tired of them, but they didn't feel as slow/deathful (I know, not a word, but you get the point lol) as the Wrath ones.<br />
<br />
Not saying they should be ICC gear level wise, but I think the iLvL threshold should at least be bumped up to either 187 or 200 since that was about right for it's time. 163-&gt; 200 can make a big difference for some tanks/healers. DPS it'd make it go a little faster, but feel the impact for tanks/healers would be a bit more noticeable. Even at those iLvL it be a challenge. Right now the challenge is artificial because you are running in basically Starter Wrath gear for a heroic. Which most people can't do and usually reserved for the higher tier players.</div></div><hr />

Don't have time to find a heroic HFC group only to have it die/disband after a few failed boss attempts. Don't have any desire to run Trashran.

Fourth I think. He was originally in the Blasted Lands, then in the HFP Throne of Kil'jaeden, then came back for some event [WoD launch seems logical but I swear it was earlier than that], and finally now again in the Throne.</div></div><hr />

And a lot of other videos uploaded a lot before Raeg, yet he is the one to consistently get front page &quot;promos&quot; unlike a number of people who actually solo before him.<br />
<br />
The more impressive thing to me isn't that it was a solo kill. Its he was able to keep no one from &quot;helping&quot; him kill it. World Bosses spawn and everyone and their brother shows up to &quot;help&quot;<br />

The one in HFP is the same as the Blasted Lands just boosted levels from what I recall. Not entirely a &quot;Oh he died, but he returned&quot;. There wasn't any for an event.<br />
<br />
This one we have now is a &quot;newer&quot; version.<br />
<br />
But essentially it's because Demons can't die unless they are killed in the nether. So while we kill him on our realm he still lives on. Shows the 3 version locations: http://wow.gamepedia.com/Lord_Kazzak Basically this is just Doom Lord 2.0 gone Supreme</div></div><hr />

<br />
Welcome to World of Warcraft , where not everyone can clear mythic or even heroic and even mythic raiders have alts while their guild doesn't do split or alt runs. Nice to meet you. <br />
<br />
P.S.: If it was a chest suited to your current raid progression then it would be too much of a reward + a loot seal. Common sense goes a long way.</div></div><hr />
