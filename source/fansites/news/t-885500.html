The Grounding Totem change is more significant than the Earth Shield change. It's effectively a nerf, not a buff.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure what you mean. Slight buff to resto yeah, but the grounding totem changes are straight nerf. Our cooldown is getting increased all around. I'm not crying about it, even as a shaman main, but it's definitely on the nerf end of the nerf/buff spectrum.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reverting SH dodges the PVE bullet but it still remains largely useless in PVP. <br />

But they buffed the healing. This is a nerf to the other 2 shaman specs. Resto gets better tank heals in change of increased CD on grounding totem, ele and enh just get shafted.<br />

<br />
The glyph gives Grounding Totem a chance to reflect the cast that it eats, it would be unfair to caster classes to have such a totem be available at the same CD as an unglyphed Grounding Totem. Thus the increase to the CD while glyphed. But now since the CD has been increased from 15s to 25s, reducing the glyphed time by 10s (the increase) keeps the totem use at once per minute.</div></div><hr />

Rebuke already has a 10sec CD.<br />
<br />
<br />
They should at least make it so WoG and Selfless Healer have the same duration and cd. It would be great for PvP and PvE, it would make the Paladin class exactly what it is supposed to be: Holy Warrior. If the made the timing work out, all they would have to do is nerf the % inc to balance things out. It would make Paladins have to heal to keep the buff up.</div></div><hr />

The previous numbers were not designed for medium or well anything but extra large guilds in mind. To be fair to blizzard they were designed when achievements would actually level guilds (ie there was an incentive to do them).

No, you are wrong.<br />
<br />
Since you are not the only one speaking of what you dont know, here it goes:<br />
<br />
Glyph of Grounding Totem<br />
Major Glyph<br />
Classes: Shaman<br />
Requires Level 38<br />
Item Level 38<br />
Use: Permanently teaches you this glyph.<br />
<br />
Instead of absorbing a spell, your Grounding Totem reflects the next harmful spell back at its caster, but the cooldown of your Grounding Totem is increased by 45 sec.<br />
Cheers :)<br />
<br />
And to whoever thinks wind shear is stupidly OP: its a 2second school lock. its 5 sec lock for kick. 4 sec to the other 10 sec CD interrupts.

Not in the meaning of QQ, I just think that this creates a situation where active guilds will be &quot;finished&quot; pretty quickly. And then what? I expected them to introduce new/continued guild achievements in the next expansion, but at this rate, they'd have to do that nearly every content patch.<br />
<br />
that's not a nerf those numbers were pulled out of their ass at launch cause they honestly had no idea, the system wasn't in place for them to pull those kinds of stats til now. now they have stats they can adjust achievements to reasonable numbers. trust me, unless your guild has like 600 members, the new numbers are still plenty high for rest of expansion. if you're in a huge 600 member guild though they good for you, but blizz is not gonna balance guild achievements around that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
40k seems REALLY low for a saving instant heal. I can crit over 90k with it when I'm below 10% health, but then again I'm reforging mastery for a reason contrary to what ppl tell me to do.<br />
Still the nerf to Grounding totem is gonna hurt the other 2 speccs more then it is gonna hurt resto in PvP. Resto is in a really good place and with the Grounding Totem-nerf they are still gonna be there but when considering that Elemental shaman, and to a lesser degree Enhancment, are SOL in PvP they are gonna feel the nerf even more.</div></div><hr />

Yup. The cryers win again. Every single achievement must be balanced around 4 man guild getting them in a month. 3 man raid instances incoming soon. Otherwise it's too 'hard' and 'nolife'.<br />
I was only at 5k by pretty casual glyph crafting. I restock only like 1-2 times per month and post only like once per day.</div></div><hr />

So Blizzard increased the cooldown on grounding totem because the cooldown on the grounding totem glyph was decreased? That makes absolutely no sense. Hardly anyone uses the glyph, anyway.<br />
<br />
And the 4 piece PvP set bonus still sucks. If Blizzard wasn't planning to disable 2x 2 piece in 4.2, no resto or ele shaman would ever bother with the 4 piece set.</div></div><hr />

The change is meant to line up with the spell reflect cooldown increase (I think I was the 1st person to complain about it on forums). For people using the Glyph of Grounding Totem, it's a buff, considering the final cooldown will remain 60 sec and the 4pc PvP set will decrease it to 57 sec.<br />
<br />
AHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA, no.<br />
<br />
They modified the CD on the glyph because of the change. Same for the 4piece bonus (which no one uses. no one gives a damn about 4 piece bonus. 400 extra resil? yes please).<br />
I mean, come on. Thats obvious Oo</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why does everyone think &quot;fishes&quot; is wrong?<br />
<br />
It IS correct grammar.<br />
<br />
You can use fish fairly freely, but &quot;fishes&quot; is used when talking about more than one particular fish species.<br />
Considering it counts all the fish in the game, fishes is correct.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adalwolf</div><div class="date">2011-04-12, 11:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So Blizzard increased the cooldown on grounding totem because the cooldown on the grounding totem glyph was decreased? That makes absolutely no sense. Hardly anyone uses the glyph, anyway.<br />
<br />
And the 4 piece PvP set bonus still sucks. If Blizzard wasn't planning to disable 2x 2 piece in 4.2, no resto or ele shaman would ever bother with the 4 piece set.<br />
<br />
By &quot;Spell Reflect&quot; I mean the warrior ability called Spell Reflect, which got its CD increased to 25 seconds. To line up with the warrior changes, the CD on the Grounding Totem got increased as well. If you use the glyph of Grounding Totem, in the worst case scenario, nothing changed for you, the cooldown remains at 60 sec. If you use the 4pc PvP set, then it's a buff. <br />

You seem to be confused.<br />
<br />
The change is meant to line up with the spell reflect cooldown increase<br />
Glyphed grounding totem is a spell reflect. After the changes, the cooldown is still the same (1.5 sec shorter in 4.1.0 with 4pc), while the warrior spell reflect cooldown was increased.<br />
<br />
Unglyphed grounding totem is not a spell reflect. You claim the cooldown was increased to be in line with the warrior ability, but it makes absolutely no sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Last place of course. Everyone have been able to faceroll over shamans for 6+ years, they don't like it when 1 of the 3 specs actually require some thought processes to kill. Shamans have always been free kills so if/when they are not people will scream nerf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dev 1: Uh oh people are saying Paladin Ability X is too powerful in PVE/PVP!<br />
Dev 2: Nerf it to the ground!<br />
Dev 1: Hmm now the Pally numbers are too low in PVE, the people are saying they can't find raid spots.<br />
Dev 2: That nerf might have been too harsh, let's revert it.<br />
Dev 1: Now people are saying Paladin Ability Z is way OP and Pallys are dominating the DPS charts.<br />
Dev 2: Let's reduce it a bit.<br />
Dev 1: Now Paladin Ability Y doesn't work at all because it used Pally Ability Z.<br />
Dev 2: Hmm... revert that change, and let's modify Y to do ABC instead...</div></div><hr />

it seems most ppl are missing that one? ...COME ON . i dont give a fuck about pvp. it is a really annoying nerf for pve. <br />
i hate that ppl are complaining about pvp issues, when its totally fine in pve . i dont give a fuck about pvp<br />
<br />
