<br />
What? It STILL works with Divine Light, they just added two other heals to the set bonus instead of ONLY one....and reduced the amount by half (20 to 10% is reasonable considering it can bounce of 3 heals now instead 1)<br />
<br />
Personally I like that change....as using only Divine Light would be bad anyway...i can see Holy Light spamming being much more efficient now considering 100% travels through beacon and it will splash a nearby ally for 10% as well.</div></div><hr />

Its hard now, but its 4.2 so there will be a few new pets so it will be easier? :)<br />
The store just serves as an 'easy' way to get them if you want to spend cash for it, but i doubt they will ever enforce achievements that can only be earned if you spend money in the blizzard store to reach certain numbers :P</div></div><hr />

This change is a bit different from live, if i'm reading it right.<br />
<br />
Lets say your a warlock, and before the fight you forget to create a soulstone. Blah blah blah, you guys pull, the fight starts, something goes wrong and a DPS or healer dies. <br />
In live right now, if you were the only battle rezer, you'd have to: Cast Create soulstone, and then cast the actual soulstone on the dead person to rez them.<br />
By the looks of this change, they're making it where you can just bypass creating the stone, if using it as a battle rez, and just cast the spell on the dead person.<br />
<br />
....Or I read something wrong.</div></div><hr />

As others have said it does help to have had some pets that are no longer obtainable or all the childrens weeks pets already, but they will always add more pets each patch or so, so it will be achieveable without buying blizz store pets^ you just have to wait a bit longer to complete it:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doable without pets bought from the store, special one-time events, or the trading card game it is impossible to my knowledge and count (or very close to it if you count even the rarest of companion pets).<br />
<br />
The remaining pets I need excluding TCG/one time event ones (BUT including store in the total) comes out to a total in the mid 140s for me. So even with the store mounts I don' hit the target. Without store mounts/TCG/special event ones I don't think it's possible to break 150.</div></div><hr />

lol...wut?<br />
<br />
They nerfed enh shaman's purged by giving them what...400% increased mana cost? double mana on an already horribly OP ability is negligible at best. Also...6 sec cd reverted for PvE?...you cant be serious. The only fight where you need to spam ss is possibly Omni (assuming you dont have a shaman or hunter...). This is clearly a pvp change reverted cuz of QQ<br />

Also, once again...RoF in pve? adds on halfus and adds on nef are essentially the only things of significance. So no, pve isnt the reason they reverted it.<br />

<br />
Instant cast, same size and range.<br />
<br />
The ground effect would last longer, perhaps 15 seconds. The Freeze effect would be reduced to 5 sec. In PvP, a maximum of 5 players could be frozen per cast. The cooldown would be reduced to 1 min.</div></div><hr />

You do realize you're basing this &quot;nerf&quot; off unofficial data, right? Meaning that the initial (datamined) change never went through, and instead changed them this way.<br />

It means you can be interrupted and have to stop, which can make a big difference in PvP. PvE wise this means you can't use HC as a free FF application without breaking ur rotation. Then there is the oh shit properties of this skill (adds/tank dying) which will go away with a caste time. <br />
<br />
I don't really do arenas, but in BGs this means I can't rush a flag room, rush a base cap..... yeah<br />
<br />
HC is great for making people use their trinkets/cd or punishing them if they can't/won't do so. SotA is another BG where if you are behind a Siege you will pretty much miss HC.<br />

Add tank dies on H-Nef, freeze buys enough time to brez and let the tank grab them again.<br />
<br />
Kiting adds on H-Conclave for freezing your current pack to pick up the second. Same with H-Magmaw when needed to line up the adds under a single HB to keep Chillblains from being staggered. <br />

Its only use is put frost fever on a group if for some reason you don't have any runes up for Howling Blast. 20 bucks says that cast time also resets the swing timer.

everyone who says that rogues/melees are fine atm shouldnt just look at his one guild, melees/rogues are totaly undertuned atm (expect arms warrior) in a top500 it could happen that the rogue is the only player who isnt braindead, but if you play on a level where worldfirst or a good ranking matters, you probably will reroll on a warlock/hunter/shadow/mage for 4.2 progession</div></div><hr />

It's funny that they gave axes to rogues, instead of Swords to shaman &quot;with axes for rogues, there's loads more weapons to be made for both rogue and shamans&quot; or something like that, and yet they keep on giving STR weapon to war/dk's a lot. <br />

It's not good enough, and i don't even play enhancement myself, but since icc, slow 1 handers with agility, have been sparse, or from some of the last bosses.</div></div><hr />

It seems almost impossible to get without buying pets from the blizzard store, which isn't something every can do.<br />
Wasn't it Blizzard's stance to have achievements achievable by everyone, not just those with access to a creditcard?<br />
<br />
According to WarcraftPets...<br />
<br />
61 pets are available from vendors (includes guild achieve pets)<br />
48 pets are available from drops (includes seasonal event pets)<br />
24 pets are available from quests<br />
14 pets are available from crafting and archaeology<br />
12 pets are available from achievements<br />
4 pets are available from Collector's Editions<br />
<br />
Thats 163 pets already, without going to the store. If you narrow it down to one faction, on US servers, it comes down to roughly 155. A dedicated collector who has been playing the one character for some time will easily have 150, or be very close.<br />
<br />
I don't understand why people think they need to get achievements as soon as they are released. New pets are released in-game all the time. If you'd been reading MMO lately, you would realise the following pets have been datamined, and look like they will be available in 4.2...<br />
<br />
- Feline Familiar<br />
- Fire Lasher<br />
- Hyjal Bear Cub<br />
- Creepy Crate (potentially)<br />
- Chirping Box<br />
<br />
Add these to the two pets you will get on your way to 150 (Nuts and Brilliant Kaliri), and that's 7 new pets, without even including the whelpling from the legendary staff.</div></div><hr />

The problem is, they can't stop fiddling. Some of the changes are just not needed, but they just feel the need to tinker with spells. The question is ..... why? <br />
<br />
We can only assume that with the lack of changes to Rogues the last year or so, they are perfect ... a good benchmark. Why don't they simulate a rogue in numerous sets of gear, and then simulate every other class and buff/nerf accordingly. Doesn't seem that hard to me. Oh wait, then we have pvp ..... well there goes my idea of balance, I mean obviously Wrecking Crew is so OP in pvp...</div></div><hr />

The remaining pets I need excluding TCG/one time event ones (BUT including store in the total) comes out to a total in the mid 140s for me. So even with the store mounts I don' hit the target. Without store mounts/TCG/special event ones I don't think it's possible to break 150.<br />

There are 160 pets available through ingame methods, granted this includes some pets that are no longer available such as the Spirit of Competition and Onyxian Whelpling, but still you do not need to pay anything but your subscription to get the achievement.</div></div><hr />

Dear Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Please remove Arenas from the game. Stop ruining the game experience for the vast majority of players because you need to cater to a tiny minority of people who play your failed esport competitively. As a side benefit, rated BG's will actually be played, but they do not require knife's edge balancing of all class abilities.</div></div><hr />

Saving a tank on a moment the healer won't be able to heal him, kiting adds on every heroic mode that frost dks are one of the classes/spec used to do it (magmaw herioc, conclave heroic, ...).

<br />
Now it's useless since they won't give it a longer duration or protection to not break from damage other than diseases. While RoF gets back to instant. Makes no sense.

And you can throw RF where you want to. You can't HC anywhere, that's why it's instant since you need to be meleeing the targets to use it. Just the fact that the mage can throw that where he wants and made ppl there move from it (breaking their casts! You just won there, there is no drawback on it since you at least interrupt ppl casting to move from it, and you protect yourself from melees if you stand on it!). If you can't get melee on a target, you can't HC. Except for melees (and some of them can just ignore your HC like another DK using AMS when expecting a HC inc), ranged ppl didn't have that much problem. He HC you... but well... his purpose is to kill you, so he'll punch you and break it... lol and bgs... good luck keeping ppl blocked there... RoF &quot;I used it, stop casting and move now while I kick your ass from far away LOLOLOLOLOL&quot; is way more effective.<br />
<br />
And arenas? lol... always was a game of comps countering comps and comps that trumph most of the others (and good old comps stayed competitive anyways, just an extra comp avaiable now for a now viable spec) and we DO have a &quot;plethora&quot; of classes/specs that can give you the same problems as a HC can on them with instant aoe stuns, aoe fears, etc... that will be way more deadly (stay there stunned while I bladestorm the hell of their asses).<br />
<br />
And yes, right now, if this change goes live, HC became useless in PvE, wich should make it not a mandatory talent anymore for the spec.</div></div><hr />

# Ravage! additional damage seems to be reduced from 3218 to 330, but that's kinda sketchy so you might want to wait for a confirmation.<br />

Wasn't it Blizzard's stance to have achievements achievable by everyone, not just those with access to a creditcard?<br />
<br />
<br />
It is possible without buying pets from the store. But you will need almost every seasonal pet or old event pets and so on. I currently have 146 pets , and i still need 2 alliance argent pets. Then the 2 pets from the 100 &amp; 125 pet achievement and i'am done ;D. But i have to say that i have the collectors pets ( no blizzcon pet though :( ). <br />
Funny thing is that i don't have all the Childreens Week Pets because i deleted 2 of them in Bc and Back in the Days when the First Childrens Week was introduced i took the bag of gold XD'</div></div><hr />

<br />
How can you have trouble understanding this?! Arcane blast counts for about 85% of an Arcane Mage's damage because the other spells used hit for very little, DK's have a range of abilities that deal amounts of damage over a wider range (and over time). Different classes work differently ya'know.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard: Frost DK doesn't need to be looked at or adjusted as long as mages and rogues are so completely broken and over the top with their abilities in pvp.<br />
<br />
Melee classes should not have cast times on abilities, it makes the game a lot less fun, and it doesn't flow correctly. Not a single warrior I know including myself likes having a .5 sec cast time with talents on slam, a melee ability that pauses the auto attack swing timer. Shattering throw has been clunky and stupid ever since it got a 1.5 sec cast on the PTR. It's not fair or fun, especially when you compare it to a priest who is being trained by two melee behind boxes in the sewers and facing away from the paladin who just bubbles on the other side of the map and just got .5 sec mass dispelled via ground target. It's not balanced is it blizzard?<br />
<br />
Ring of frost should really be removed from the game but since that isn't going to happen, put a 2 sec cast time on it, not 1.5, and clearly not 0. Far too many instant abilities in the game for dps casters. A mage in the hands of a good player is already a total nightmare, they don't need a huge instant ring of frost.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time.<br />
<br />
Edit: Cheap shot opener or garrote opener with a mage deep freeze right into smoke bomb twice in every arena game is the complete opposite of fun. Please fix that.</div></div><hr />

I don't know about 4.2, but in 4.1 Frost DKs main ability is obliterate. Other than obliterate you have 2 diseases to apply and then use frost strike to dump RP. That is about it in a nutshell. Frost DKs have been greatly simplified so they really don't use a wide range of abilities to DPS.<br />

<br />
Valor gets turned in to Justice Points and current Valor gear becomes purchasable with Justice Points.<br />
<br />
I can't remember what happens to your current Justice Points. I know you'll lose them, but I am not sure if you will get gold compensation for them when they are removed.</div></div><hr />

If DKs could still move while casting Hungering Cold, it would still be useful in pvp.</div></div><hr />

Hungering Cold: Only affects melee range. If I get lucky (arena) I get 2 freezed targets of which one is going to go free cos he is my main target and the other can be dispelled. It's not that OP in arena but if you must, replace it with a Repentance-like ability and I bet most DKs wil be happy.</div></div><hr />

Exactly you're including one-time event pets and I'm also not sure but you might be including faction-specific pets in that total which reduces the number achievable even more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
61 pets are available from vendors (includes guild achieve pets)<br />
48 pets are available from drops (includes seasonal event pets)<br />
24 pets are available from quests<br />
14 pets are available from crafting and archaeology<br />
12 pets are available from achievements<br />
4 pets are available from Collector's Editions<br />
<br />
Thats 163 pets already, without going to the store. If you narrow it down to one faction, on US servers, it comes down to roughly 155. A dedicated collector who has been playing the one character for some time will easily have 150, or be very close.<br />
<br />
I don't understand why people think they need to get achievements as soon as they are released. New pets are released in-game all the time. If you'd been reading MMO lately, you would realise the following pets have been datamined, and look like they will be available in 4.2...<br />
<br />
- Feline Familiar<br />
- Fire Lasher<br />
- Hyjal Bear Cub<br />
- Creepy Crate (potentially)<br />
- Chirping Box<br />
<br />
Add these to the two pets you will get on your way to 150 (Nuts and Brilliant Kaliri), and that's 7 new pets, without even including the whelpling from the legendary staff.<br />
<br />
I am at 151 Pets right now, so yeah... i can confirm it *IS* possible ;)</div></div><hr />
