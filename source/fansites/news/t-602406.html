I didn't have much time to talk about everything last week, we had already way too many things on the site. <br />
For all the warriors still wondering where they can get [item=33174], it drops from Enraged Air Spirits (http://www.wowhead.com/n21060), Enraged Earth Spirits (http://www.wowhead.com/n21050), Enraged Water Spirits (http://www.wowhead.com/n21059) and Enraged Fire Spirits (http://www.wowhead.com/n21061) in Shadowmoon Valley.<br />
Terokk now drops [item=32782], it transforms you into an Arakkoa for 5 minutes and the best part is ... it doesn't fade when you change zone, take damage, fight, or anything like that. (but you can't mount while transformed like any other transformation)<br />
I forgot to one loot from the Headless Horseman (added in 2.2.2 during the halloween event, see the other loots in this post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=1390.0)), you can get an awesome pet from him called Sinister Squashling. It's a walking pumpkin that will dig itself in the earth when you don't move. (Thanks to Beeble for the screenshots)<br />

Season 1 gear for honor at the beginning of Season 3<br />
If you read this site often, you know that the Season 1 arena gear will be available from honor points vendor when the season 3 starts. However I missed a blue post written before the week end with a very interesting detail. I also added this to the list of PvP changes in the 2.3 &quot;unofficial patch notes&quot; just below. <br />
Update 12:00 : I should really sleep more, weapons will indeed be included, post was from 08.28 not 09.28 (not my fault, blame Wildhorn)<br />
We've stated on numerous occasions that Season 1 items will be available from honor vendors, and this does include weapons.<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 2.2.2 and 2.3<br />
Small reminder for the beginning of the week.<br />
2.2.2 Patch<br />
According to this blue post on french official forums (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=1016342728&amp;sid=2), the brewfest should start on October 3rd. The 2.2.2 patch should be deployed on live servers tuesday and <br />
2.3 Patch<br />
If you read this post (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=1778517774&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=16#317) from Tigole, you will see that Blizzard plans to release the 2.3 on PTR this week, which means Zul'aman, new items everywhere, official patch notes for the classes changes, and more. <br />
<br />
This week will probably be a very busy one, if you're a member (if you're not, go register ! (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?action=register)) you might experience some problem logging in while the site is in &quot;omg server is burning mode&quot;. <br />
<br />
<br />
Last batch of 2.2 Patch undocumented changes<br />
Viral updated once again his post on the official forums (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=1778015283&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=1#0) listing all the 2.2 undocumented changes. I will only add the latest additions in the post, you can see the old ones in this news (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=1330.0)<br />
<br />
Character Models, Animation, &amp; Spell Effects<br />
Spell Reflect graphic changed; now appears on the character instead of over them<br />
Frostbolt has flashier, more dynamic impact effect<br />
Counterspell has new graphic that encircles the target<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
Grips of Silent Justice now recolored tier 6 warrior gloves instead of recolored tier 6 paladin gloves<br />
Netherweave bandages now sell to vendors for 12 silver, 75 copper<br />
Heavy Neatherweave bandages now sell to vendors for 30 silver<br />
Wicked Edge of the Planes no longer has the firey trail behind it<br />
Sylvanaar Champion's Shoulders have had their strength bonus reduced from +36 to +22<br />
Letters are now soulbound, role players fail to grok reasoning behind this change<br />
Deprecated Tauren Trapper's Pants no longer makes your character's underwear disappear which, if worn by a tauren, comes as a relief to every other race in the game<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
UI &amp; Game Mechanics<br />
Monstrous Kaliri also give soul shards now, still no less obnoxious<br />
The Illidan encounter seems to have changed, now includes a 25 minute berserk timer<br />
Warlock Dreadsteed quest now requires one arcanite bar down from three. Veteran warlocks everywhere shake their vile little fists in rage<br />
Drain Life spell indicates player gains X life every 0 seconds<br />
Resurrection spells appear to be returning players to life with quite a bit more life and mana<br />
Skyguard reputation gain has been more than slightly increased<br />
Tainted and Enchanted elementals in the Vashj encounter now track as Elementals instead of Humanoids<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Comics<br />
Two comics today, the usual Dark Legacy and another one that might reminds you an old Dark Legacy (again) comic (http://www.darklegacycomics.com/29.html).<br />

In your news, you have quote Drysc about first season's weapons:<br />
<br />
It was mentioned at BlizzCon that as arena sets fall off they would make their way to the honor system. So when a season 3 set is released, season 1 would fall off the arena vendors and onto the honor vendors, but this may not include weapons.<br />
Drysc didn't write this post last friday. He wrote it the 28th August !!!<br />
<br />
I think season 1's weapons will be able to buy with honor as it was sayed on french forums:<br />
<br />
Les armes de la Saison 1 d'Ar&amp;#232;ne devraient finalement &amp;#234;tre disponibles aupr&amp;#232;s des vendeurs et accessibles via les points d'honneur, tout comme les autres r&amp;#233;compenses de la Saison 1.<br />
This post want to say that weapons will be able to buy with honor.<br />

It depends what your current hit rating is. If you're capped for bosses, there's no point in adding more hit rating.<br />
<br />
And &quot;exalted&quot; doesn't have an &quot;h&quot; :P</div></div><hr />

I'm guessing if you ever want it just for the looks at any point you can still get the lvl 60 gear.</div></div><hr />

I'd heard 15k for each item, think it was posted on this site a quote from someone at Blizzard, can't find it now though, so I may have dreamed it all :)<br />

Season 3 weapons = Most ARENA points require, must sastify min. arena RATING to purchase<br />
<br />
Season 2 weapons = Drop in ARENA points required, NO RATING requirement<br />
<br />
Season 1 Weapons = Purchased with HONOR points, NO RATING requirement<br />
<br />
Is that what they're trying to say?<br />
