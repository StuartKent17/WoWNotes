Tier 12 Set Bonuses - Additional Information &amp; Clarification<br />
Additional Information &amp; Clarification<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Fire damage-over-time effects from some set bonuses work like Ignite, and will accumulate and refresh damage just as it does.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Mirror Image summoned by the http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage set (2-piece bonus) does not cause him/her to drop threat. It summons a guardian who appears like the mage and casts Fireballs by his/her side.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage 4-piece bonus stats: +15% proc chance to Brain Freeze, +30% chance on single critical effect to Hot Streak, and Arcane Missiles will always proc by the 4th cast.<br />
<br />
<br />
The http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue 4-piece bonus never picks hit or expertise, and never picks the same rating twice in a row.<br />
<br />
<br />
The http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior 2-piece bonus gets its duration reduced based on the number of talent points the warrior has in Booming Voice. It lasts 12/9/6 seconds at 0/1/2 points spent in Booming Voice.<br />
<br />
<br />
The http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter 4-piece bonus does not get consumed by shots that do not cost focus.<br />
<br />

PTR Raid Testing Schedule 5/16-5/17<br />
The next phase of raid testing is as follows:<br />
<br />
Monday, May 16<br />
EU 10:30 AM PDT - Alysrazor, 10 player<br />
US 4:30 PM PDT - Alysrazor, 10 player<br />
<br />
Tuesday, May 17<br />
EU 10:30 AM PDT - Baleroc, 10 player<br />
US 4:30 PM PDT - Majordomo Staghelm, 10 player<br />
<br />
We will be testing on both EU and US PTR realms initially, with other regions to come later. 25 Player and Heroic testing will happen later in the PTR testing cycle.<br />
<br />
As always, the schedule can change at a moment’s notice due to issues with the build, server, encounter, or the fickle, fickle nature of designers. The encounters are all a work in progress; there will be bugs and tuning is not final. <br />
<br />

Fire Damage in Firelands<br />
Creatures in the Firelands will not be immune to Fire damage. Giving raid mobs and bosses immunity to a school of magic just doesn't work well, given that some classes/specs are dependent upon the damage output from that school.<br />
<br />
Instead, we've themed many of the set bonuses around the Firelands. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/175548/tier-12-set-bonuses-feedback) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2522434404?page=3#45))<br />
<br />
DPS classes never benefit from the Dungeon Finder CTA<br />
We recognize it's not the most elegant solution. Ideally we wouldn't offer greater incentives to one player over another based purely on the class role they each fulfill. That said, the disparity in queue times was unacceptable in our eyes, and we saw that sentiment shared throughout the community.<br />
<br />
Perhaps there are better ways for us to lower queue times without having to offer additional rewards to the class role in highest demand in the Dungeon Finder, but Call to Arms is a feature we were able to develop in a much more reasonable time frame.<br />
<br />
Do we like that your only reward from the Call to Arms feature is a shorter queue time? No. But then, if the queue times were more equal for each class role, we wouldn't have added Call to Arms in the first place.(Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/175494/how-is-it-fair-that-dps-never-get-ctas) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2522463654?page=5#83))<br />

<br />
But, having watched this now, I have to change my stance. That's a lot of development time, and unique experience, devoted to what will be a very small percentage of the WoW playerbase. If they could put this in, why couldn't they add more class quests in? Class quests wouldn't have to be this long, or involved.<br />
<br />
And while I admit that this is an improvement, lorewise, over the crafting of Shadowmourne, I also have to say that owners of other legendaries must feel kinda cheated, watching this video--it's just much more elaborate.<br />

The Blue Dragonflight are the aspects of magic, so it makes sense that they'd be somehow connected to a powerful caster legendary weapon. As this expansion unfolds I would not be surprised if all the dragon flights band together with the players to take down Deathwing (well, all dragon flights except the black dragonflight)</div></div><hr />

If they could put this in, why couldn't they add more class quests in? Class quests wouldn't have to be this long, or involved.<br />
<br />
And while I admit that this is an improvement, lorewise, over the crafting of Shadowmourne, I also have to say that owners of other legendaries must feel kinda cheated, watching this video--it's just much more elaborate.<br />
<br />
It's cool content. Shame that most people won't experience it firsthand. Seems like the left and right hands of the devteam don't talk very often.<br />
<br />
Blizzard keeps improving their games alot. Same goes for WoW. Questing has changed alot since Cataclysm, and this questchain proves Blizzards finesse once more. <br />
Just because you and i cannot wield and therefor experience this questchain doesn't mean that the people who do shouldnt experience it. To be honest, thats just being a whiny little selfish brat who cant have all the cool stuff other kids have. <br />
<br />
PS: Would like to add aswell, that a legendary weapon without a proper backstory just isn't a legendary. It would just be another piece of loot, just having orange text for teh lulz (Looking at you here, Thori'dal). This questchain and the things you have to do for obtaining your legendary should trully give you the feeling of having worked for your legendary.<br />
I admit that im jealous i will not be able to see this myself (not much of an alt-gearing guy either), but i do take off my hat for Blizzards work into this quest, and wish all them staff wielders the best of zeh luck getting their legendaries.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. But to remain objective, only the player who has the quest will see it, so if he/she likes extremely goofy stuff, like an undead riding a lasebeam weapon riding a T-Rex riding a giant whale shark &quot;goofy snooky stupid&quot; stuff, that's ok. For the rest of us, it would be appreciated if you would implement a fix that shows the player in caster form in that part, because it's immersion breaking.</div></div><hr />

If they open up the azure sanctum raid in some future patches, then its a different story. Sadly they didnt make Arygos a raid boss for everyone to participate.<br />

You completely missed the point, Blizz has said they dont want to do any involved class specific quests anymore because its so much work for something that only a percentage of people get to see, they would have to make an epic quest chain for each class and each would need to be different... and yet here we have an epic quest chain that will only ever be seen by maybe 5 percent of the playerbase.</div></div><hr />

Exactly my thoughts!!<br />

After years of putting up with other classes not understanding why ignite was such a factor on affecting our DPS, hopefully this will teach everyone a bit more about the mechanic, and how frustrating it can sometimes be!</div></div><hr />

By short, you mean by a few minutes. Yeah, some realms have it better, but my queue times are still the same. Not to mention many people can't be devoted into tank or healer and some are just straight bad if they join those roles without proper gear, especially for the newer heroics. I don't really care too much of the CTA, but they should remove it though. Invites more bad players than usual to tank or heal.</div></div><hr />

Thank you, Snowcrash, for fielding that comment--&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
It's not that I'm opposed to unique, epic, fun questing content. Au contraire, I'm in strong support of it. It's that Blizzard has specifically stated that they DON'T want to develop content that relatively few get to experience, despite repeated player feedback requesting it for class-specific stuff, and now they're essentially doing that for DPS casters. <br />
<br />
I think Legendaries do deserve a story of this caliber. I bet previous legendary owners (even, as I mentioned, Shadowmourne owners) feel kinda cheated by the epic-ness of this legendary's story/questline compared to previous ones. <br />
<br />
But mostly I just would like some consistency. If it's not okay to develop a quest line where rogues have to actually do rogue-ish things (just an example), then I don't see how it's okay to develop a quest line that only will be experienced by a fraction of a fraction (--&gt;ie, not only do they have to be certain specs, but they have to fulfill raid/farming requirements) of the playerbase.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Class quests =/= Legendary quests.<br />
<br />
Why would Older legendary owners feel cheated? That was a completely different era in WoW, where much of the newer questing mechanics werent even in the game yet. What do you expect Blizzard to do, stick to the old ways of handing out legendaries, or try creating a completely new experience for crafting legendaries in the future? Obviously, its the latter.<br />
<br />
There is no middle way in this. People who cannot wield/craft the legendary have absolutely no use for this chain, as they will gain nothing out of it. Neither would it make any sense that you assist the Blue Dragonflight in this chain when ultimatly it leads to nothing.</div></div><hr />
