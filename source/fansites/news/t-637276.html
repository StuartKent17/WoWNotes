Here is the thread for Ignis the Furnace Master feedback. Ignis will be active at 7PM EST on the US PTRs. You can zone into Ulduar before 7PM PST.<br />
<br />
Ignis is located at the Colossal Forge. There is a teleporter from the Expedition Base Camp that will take you there. Both 10 and 25 player modes are active.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Several raids felt that they were finished the encounter after they had cleared Ignus, however they did not stay until it was completely hot-fixed and live during the test.<br />
<br />
This happened mostly, I believe, due to the complications with individuals that released when dead and not being able to relog back into Ulduar. The infamous World Server Down<br />
<br />
It was much more difficult with the Slag pot. :P<br />
<br />
For those that test again, always have a pally ready to DI a rez√©r and no one should release, normal raid procedures for serious guilds.</div></div><hr />

slag pot is hard ? sounds to me quite easy, 5k tickin every 1 second, ezmode for a holy paladin to outheal with just holy light (Theroretic) haven't seen the fight yet, I dont know if the slag pit got hit by a AoE thing or anything, then it could be tricky</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That's how I would buff the encounter, TBH. Make the pot affect 3-5 random people (2 normal) at once, AND make it also do the same damage to anyone within 10 yards BUT DON'T give the splash damage any haste bonus at the end. (Otherwise you'd just stack up and chain heal spam.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shame you need to survive 50.000 damage in 10 seconds for that to get it.<br />
Means you'll need a good bit of healing.<br />
<br />
But, it's probably the key to beating the fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Daelo said that Ignis would be one of the few bosses who didn't have a hard mode in general chat.<br />
<br />
But that could always change once they implement all the achievements.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flamingcloud</div><div class="date">2009-03-05, 01:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You say &quot;the encounter seems to be undertuned&quot; and said the same for flame leviathian and some of the others.<br />
<br />
I think personally this is pretty much what will be going live. They have said repeatedly that there will be hard modes to satisfy the better guilds.<br />
<br />
If these bosses are intended for your average guild to down in a few nights of work then guilds such as D+T will be killing them in a few hours of play.<br />
<br />
I really don't see Ulduar normal mode having much life expectancy at all. I think it will be cleared in its first week personally.<br />
<br />
<br />
Depends how hard they want things. Historically speaking the only bosses in BC on the same level as Ignis are as follows, Supremus, Void Reaver, Akama. I would say that if they want a boss this easy only one should be this easy. There is a difference between a boss that takes a few hours for a top 10 world guild and one that takes 2 pulls for a top 250.<br />
<br />
Flame Leviathan has some complexity and hard modes, it is probably fine as is, after all that was the 10 man. Not to mention the vehicles scale with ilvl and that was 25 man guilds doing it for the most part.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stupid11</div><div class="date">2009-03-05, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shame you need to survive 50.000 damage in 10 seconds for that to get it.<br />

<br />
<br />
Not really. It's basically Burn from Brutallus, but probably even easier to heal through. Burn's last ticks were &gt;3000 a second, and +healing was at about HALF of what it is now, as was total stamina. Not to mention that more than 1 person could have it at the same time. This is only 5000 a second. It will be trivial, especially for the result, which is 150% haste, versus no benefit for Brutallus.<br />
<br />
There needs to be more than 1 person taking this damage at once for this to be hard, and you need to splash it so that people can't stack up.<br />
<br />
Also, only 24m HP? Needs to be at most a 5 minute enrage timer if they want this to be significant at all. With half the raid having 150% haste, you can practically AFK and do 24m damage in 7-10 minutes.</div></div><hr />

I'm a warrior tank in more or less best in slot gear, maybe a piece or two you don't agree with, but that's beside the point. My 10 man group accidentally zoned into heroic mode. Just for fun we pulled. The first mel√©e attack hit me for 40k instantly killing me. It was a single head on attack, so it was legit, but in full raid buffs that was still instant death. I'm wondering if anybody else experienced this and how the warrior tank on the stream survived this? Feel free to armory me, I'm the only Cytokhan in the game.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flamingcloud</div><div class="date">2009-03-05, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But in Wotlk so far, all the bosses have been kill in one night. I did read a GC comment that said something like Ulduar will be harder than naxx, but not kara &gt; ssc/tk harder. <br />
<br />
The game has changed and the bosses will be easier than they were back in those days because they want people to see more content. They also want you to be able to raid with 9/24 friends rather than have to optimise your raid.<br />
<br />
Guilds that have raided for a long time are still optimising their raids so things seem undertuned. I would imagine if you went to 25 man Ignis with a random composition of people in 10/25/crafted naxx epics he would be somewhat of a challenge. And that is what the normal modes of these bosses are being tuned for. Not your 5 night a week sunwell clear guilds.<br />
<br />
<br />
GC defintely did not ever say that, all he ever said was harder he did not say how much harder. Also Kara is way harder than Naxx. If the hard modes are ssc/tk difficulty level that will be a travesty, that is not hard. I am expecting some of the hard modes to be sunwell level(not m'uru level but still hard). They said naxx was designed to be puggable. There is zero chance they want that puggability factor to remain. Ignis is still harder than anything in naxx, malygos, or 0D Sarth even if we killed it two shot.</div></div><hr />

Hmm? He was hitting me 30-33k Granted I am a dk, but still you shouldn't be taking 25% more on an unavoided hit.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flamingcloud</div><div class="date">2009-03-05, 05:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe they meant they will never make baseline encounters as hard as sunwell again. Hard modes are fair game for being as hard, or as impossible as they want, I believe they said there original intention with 3D was that they were ok with the encounter not being beaten until the next tier.<br />
<br />
And they definitely did say naxx was designed to be puggable and that would not be their design for future instances. Just look at flame leviathan, that is almost completely unpuggable. Kiting, slowing, launching people onto it to disable turrets. Ignis is easy but if you don't have a MT quality tank you still would have no hope, he hits like a truck.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There is a massive massive difference between kalecgos difficulty and m'uru difficulty. Realistically Kalec was no harder than Vashj, infact it was easier, guilds just needed to have full bt/hyjal gear and a good raid makeup to make it this level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Its interesting as most guilds clear Sarth 3D, now more and more casual guilds do it too.<br />

<br />
- Reading this thread it seems Ignis, Flame Leviathan, etc. are all easy bossess, maybe Naxx Sartharion difficulty.<br />

<br />
- We wiped on Kalecgos for months untill we discovered how survivability/positioning/100% correct rotations were so important. It was more towards executing perfect strategy rather than having full BT/Hijal gear. Once we done it, it become easier and easier and in the end we didnt even understand what made it seem so hard (before nerf). Getting 25 man to understand exactly the same strategy is a challenge most people don't consider.</div></div><hr />
