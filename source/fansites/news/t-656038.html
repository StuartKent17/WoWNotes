Just to confirm, Tome of Cold Weather Flight is actually a new heirloom item planned to go into patch 3.2. At level 80 players can buy this heirloom item from the Cold Weather Flying Trainer in Dalaran for 1,000 gold and send it to an alt of the same realm, faction and account. The tome can be used to learn Cold Weather Flying at level 68, consuming the tome in the process.<br />
<br />
Please note this feature is not yet in the newest version of the public test realm patch notes updated today. The item and its functionality are subject to change during the testing process.</div></div><hr />

Leveling is my least favorite aspect of the game after I have done it once. I enjoy it thoroughly the first time, and really don't any times after that.<br />
<br />
10% shoulders + 10% chest + always rested bonus + Cold Weather Flying + conquest badges from nearly everything = 70 to CC ready in a few weeks.</div></div><hr />

Sad part is, is that you wont stop.<br />

Funny part is, is its like your throwing a fit because someone got something that you didn't. This does no harm to your gameplay in any way shape or form. And your sad about it. :-[</div></div><hr />

People said the exact same thing when the change to allow flyers in Outlands at 60 was announced.<br />
<br />
Newsflash<br />
<br />
There is no such thing as leveling world PvP anymore.<br />
<br />
The vast vast vast majority of PvP combat that occurs outside of BGs and Wintergrasp nowadays is level 80s ganking people much much lower than them.<br />
<br />
I don't know why people don't realize and can't understand this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
World PvP died before BC was even introduced. The only thing it's ever really been since is ganking. Usually some high level idiot who sucks at PvP ganking lowbies. Half the time when I get ganked. I log in my main and destroy the scrub killing lowbies with little to no trouble. And its not like I have amazing gear either. Just the people ganking usually suck at life so thats why they gank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if they did that then new people who just level to 68 would get it, they are making it so only level 80's can buy it for their alts<br />

are you really that dense? they are changing it so alts can fly around in northrend. that's what the whole post is about</div></div><hr />

Finally, a constructive post that does not go &quot;WAH, something that has no adverse effect to me but benefits others ruins my gameplay, WAHHH.&quot; Can't tell you how glad i am to see one.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it's justified because this is only avaliable for people who have already leveled to 80. Redoing all the same content over and over and over just to get to the point where the game actually matters is just tedious and unecessary. These heirloom and flying changes serve to alleviate the tedium of leveling alts, while leveling on your first toon remains unaffected. You won't be skipping quests on your first toon, but you won't have to keep redoing stuff you've done before either. No one is losing out here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I don't think you understand what this item does. The only reason that users couldn't fly till 77 was because that was when you could receive Cold Weather Training. They are essentially changing it so that you can receive Cold Weather Training at 68.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yes, and there are quite a few of us that have 3+ 80's and a few 70's that we never took to 80, and so on. This made my jaw drop but I think that it's a good thing for those who have already leveled a few.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KandyCane</div><div class="date">2009-07-08, 07:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard stated even before the release of Wrath of the Lich King that they wouldn't allow flying in Northrend till the higher levels, because they wanted people to experience everything, instead of just grabbing a quest, mount up, auto-fly while going on Youtube/Facebook/etc, get back on WoW, kill mob, mount up, fly back. <br />
<br />
With this change, you are forced to level one character to 77 without being able to fly in Northrend, but after that you can make all of your level 68+ alts fly there, thereby saving an awful lot of time(I can't recall how many times my Warrior alt got mashed in New Hearthglen).<br />
<br />
People who whine about this is the same who whine about boss nerfs, Mount- and the Emblem changes. Just because something becomes easier for others, doesn't mean you've been cheated for anything. You level 10 characters to 77 before you could fly? Congratulations then, you've got 10 80's before anyone will be able to fly there at level 68. <br />
<br />
I, for one, will sit back and enjoy as my next alts fly away from those pesky Scarlets without anything they can do about it</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dahrken</div><div class="date">2009-07-08, 07:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can certainly see why they did this and I see it as a plus, I have 3 80's and the addition of this would make it easier if I ever bothered to do a 4th. The fact that it's heirloom means that anyone starting out still gets to experience the content the way it's meant to be the first time. That was always the big thing about new content and why we couldn't fly till 77 they wanted us to really see the content and that wont change for first timers.</div></div><hr />

No you will not. It's not a tome that you can use on all your characters just buying it once.<br />
<br />
<br />
if you have 2 chars 68+ then you need to buy 2 tomes. So still 2kg only your getting it 9 levels earlier. Just seems kind <br />

<br />
Either I missunderstood your post, or you don't know what a Heirloom is. You can't just make a random level 80 go grab this, it has to be your own.... but I'm sure I just misunderstood you :)<br />
<br />
Anyway, it -would- make leveling easier. Nothing is easier than flying. On the ground you have to watch out for mobs, run around obstacles or jump across them. None of this is present in the air(well, there's an occasional mob who can fly as well). Not to mention that you can actually buy a 280% flying mount for your alts(very unlikely for most, but still), which would make leveling soo much faster, and thereby easier.<br />
<br />
Walking = Terribly slow way of leveling<br />
Running = A bit faster.... still a pain in large areas though.<br />
Slow and steady mount = Great for peaceful rides through the woods, also makes leveling faster.<br />
Fast and somewhat steady mount = Huge difference from the rest, makes leveling a lot faster.<br />
<br />
Just slap the word 'flying' in front of the mounts if you're ever considering taking one of those. Alright, so it might not actually make it &quot;easier&quot;. It won't let you kill mobs faster. You can't tramble them or drop a bearbomb on top of them for insane amounts of damage, but it makes leveling faster. If you spend 10 hours on something, then in a way you could say it was easier than spending 16 hours on it, no?</div></div><hr />

<br />
OR a chance to level an alt that you hav'nt considered playing because of the time constraints...think of the posibilies.The developers at blizz are beginning to find out that alot of players already know azeroth inside out, and would like to get into end game content faster.Rather than struggle with the horrible grind 1-80 which some of us have seen probably one too many times, blizz is trying to give us the option to speed it up and get where we wanna be soonest.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">telemain</div><div class="date">2009-07-08, 08:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Leveling in northrend was already too fast without all the heirlooms. Now it's just plain ridiculous. When you start a zone, you'll almost certainly be out of level range for quests before you finish the zone. It makes you quit the zone early and move on to next, even though usually the best quests are the last ones in the zone that wrap up everything :(<br />
<br />
Now you can just fly so you don't even need to pay attention to little details the quests might have. Bad change imo.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fun fact, some of us have seen all the little details. Some of us have seen the little details many many times already. I don't give a crap about the little details anymore.<br />
<br />
I have 11 70+ characters. My only complaint about this is that it won't be out nearly soon enough, and I will probably end up wasting the 1k on a few more chars before it's released.</div></div><hr />

To get northrend flying? Nope, not really.<br />
<br />
Currently I am leveling my alts to 77, and then only level via argent dailies every day while I get my other alts up to 77.<br />
<br />
There isn't much reason to wait. The 1k for flying isn't all THAT much, it's just annoying. If the tome really is one time use then I won't even be wasting money so I'll have even less reason to wait.<br />

My only two thoguths on this are;<br />
<br />
1) With alts getting levelled so quick these days some people have a habit of not fully learning the class. There will always be bad players, it just seams to be getting more of them and all their alts.<br />
<br />
2) As with everything else we are limited to server and faction. I understand why this is done for various reasons but I find it a little annoying. One reason for me having a alt is to have a change, and there is nothing quite like a change of server and faction. This means I've got the slow leveling again, not a big issue but would be nice to have a option.</div></div><hr />

I've leveled 6 chars to 80 now, and I don't mind if my last ones are a bit easier to level. I don't see any point complaining that something as boring and tedious as leveling is made easier for everyone. Including yourself. You cannot really say gaining &quot;Nothing Boring about Borean&quot; achievement for 8th time is actually fun...<br />

<br />
People now level to 80 and need to L2P (although it's always happened, but I see it more now), and Blizzard are just allowing them to do it quicker. The other day, I saw a Hunter in trade who didn't know what &quot;Dazed&quot; meant, and rarely used Concussive shot. As such, they had no idea what Steady Shot (or is it Aimed?) did. <br />
<br />
Whilst I am grateful for these changes, I think it's too much at once. <br />
<br />
The only thing I would like from Blizzard is to make Heirlooms cross faction. With the amount they're bringing in, I think it's about time.</div></div><hr />

Levelled 4 characters to 80 the &quot;old&quot; way. Still have 6 sitting there between 62 and 71. This is a NICE change.<br />

It doesn't dumb the game down..your first to lv 80 still has to do it the old way. Your alt now can do it faster.<br />

Being one of those, 4 main 80s (Keh/Wuv/Kinkeh/Deekay @ Outland) all with CWF/Epix Flying which I ground my ass off to get, I recently levelled a lil 49 hunter I keep playing like an hour of here n there and the thing that keeps putting me off is having to do the same quest / zone runs and the thought of reaching 58 is depressing.<br />
<br />
Ever since the mount change got released and I burnt the last of my Heroism badges on ALL the Heirloom items n have since boosted a Pala/Lock to the 40s and eagerly awaiting the change too epic ground mounts and now this.. it has made my day!

Maybe the name &quot;heirloom&quot; is confusing, but the point is: You can only use this service if you have at least ONE LV 80. If you are fresh to the game. levelling your first character evah - you will have to do it the old way: Coldweather flying only at 77. This change is ONLY for alts.<br />

<br />
This. Seriously, you guys who claim that by making these changes, the game is becoming easier, you guys are seriously damaged. How is it easier? It just makes leveling consume less time. And when you have leveled a character once, you want to spend the least amount of time possible to get to level 80. Well, maybe that's how it's easier, to get to level 80, but what do you whiners care anyways? You can do it too. And if you already leveled many characters to 80, that's your own bloody fault.<br />

(guess what? also solve the some of the problems with gold sellers/powerlevel services!).<br />
<br />
One thing is to give flying to level 60 at OL, an outdated place that it's not the current &quot;place&quot; anymore. Guess they would even allow it at level 40 if Azeroth could be redone to allocate it easily.<br />
<br />
But it's totally diferent when you give flying on the current xpac zone when they clearly stated that they didn't want to make things so &quot;stupid&quot;. For me, it just shows that a new dev team took the place alread... &quot;why they don't keep flying in Northrend? Who did this? What? Content experience? BS, ok, let's change it a little then&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I've done it once and experienced it all!&quot; Yeah? BS. We all know that we can reach level 80 without doing even 50% of Northrend, if you're playing an alt, you have rested bonus, with decreases it even more (lol @ 80 with 3 &quot;starter&quot; maps).<br />
<br />
This would work ok with &quot;at least 2 characters at 80 with cold flying alread and 80% northrend done with those 2 together&quot; or 1 character with northrend loremaster. Then it would be &quot;I've done it alread!&quot; and give the item even for free (at least once) for that. (could even be a reward from the northrend loremaster achievement for your account).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, so this hunter didn't learn his class while killing the 2 million mobs needed to reach 80. Do you really think he would have learned it any better if he needed to kill 2.2 million?<br />
<br />
I don't get it. What's the point besides being able to fly at 68 in Northrend (which is cool, admittedly)? Why make this a tome? Couldn't you just get to 68, enter Dalaran and buy it yourself?<br />
<br />
<br />
How do people not see the point of this? They're rewarding people with an 80 already. They don't want people skipping all their hard work, but if you've seen it already, then there's no reason to see it all again.<br />

pretty nice i guess...you're still paying 1000g so it doesn't make too much of a difference<br />

Gah! Seriously? This has been explained many times throughout this thread alone. It DOES make a HUGE difference, because you can fly as soon as you step foot in Northrend, rather than doing 8 levels on the ground.</div></div><hr />

This. Having levelled 4 toons in Northrend, the prospect of levelling any more fills me with pain, but this will be so much more tolerable. <br />
<br />
If they had made the heirloom a one off 1K which can be passed around between alts to be learnt, then I would be pissed, having spent 4K on 4 cold weather skills, but they haven't, so this move is full of win.</div></div><hr />

1000g? no, not even close, try 6000g (unless you purchased epic flying on your toons at 68), because there is no way in this virtual green world that I will be taking my fat kid 60% flyer across the endless expanse of Northrend. <br />

What's the point besides being able to fly at 68 in Northrend (which is cool, admittedly)? Why make this a tome? Couldn't you just get to 68, enter Dalaran and buy it yourself?<br />
<br />
<br />
The point seems to be (although it doesn't get clear from the Screenshot, I admit that) that this tome has to be bought by a lv 80 character on your account (and same faction).<br />
<br />
It is purely a means to make levelling ALTS easier. Maybe the game checks your rooster, maybe the game only allows this to be purchased by lv 80...no idea...<br />
<br />
&quot;At level 80 players can buy this heirloom item from the Cold Weather Flying Trainer in Dalaran for 1,000 gold&quot; I imagine a lv 68 won't have the option to talk to this trainer. Even a lv 80 won't have this option maybe unless he already learned CWF too...who knows...</div></div><hr />

I'm one of those folks who's actually already leveled a bunch of toons to 80 (7 of them) and have cold weather + epic flying on each of them. I've been contemplating leveling a few more of the classes I don't have yet, but really haven't been able to motivate myself to grind through it all again slowly. With me being able to use epic flying so much earlier, I think I can shave off at least an hour per level, which will greatly re-kindle my interest in lvling another alt. As a matter of fact, I have 4 alts sitting at lvl 70 just because I didn't want to do Borean Thundra for the upteenth time.<br />
<br />
I remember on one toon, I actually skipped Borean Thundra at first and came back to do it after I got epic flying + cold weather. I know it made a world of a difference. Aside from the sheer improvement in speed of travel, being able to easily fly over mobs and traverse more complicated terrain (eg mountain in your way you normally have to go around? now fly over.. or that quest that makes you swim in water for a minute? just fly and zoom over there now) will make lvling my other alts infinitely easier. Oh, and I'll be able to turn in that quest in Dragonblight that gives me a drake to fly around earlier now, haha.</div></div><hr />

Just keep in mind that a new X-Pac is coming with a new (Hero)-Class which will start at lvl 65. So they make 3 lvls in their respective new starting area and teleport to Outland where they can now fly instantly thanks to recent flying changes.<br />
<br />
Northrend leveling will be even faster when you can fly from the beginning...tada lvl 90.<br />

Looks like besides this tome... CWF still lvl 78... Tome can only be bought by a lvl 80...<br />
<br />
Blue Post here about &quot;only a lvl 80&quot;... about CWF still lvl 78... speculation.. <br />

<br />
&quot;<br />
The tome costs 1,000 gold. It is not meant to bypass the cost of the training, but only to allow for level 80 players with alts the ability to fly in Northrend once they arrive at level 68. It's a small perk for those who have reached level 80 and like leveling new races or classes. :) <br />
<br />
Players must be level 80 to purchase the tome and it can only be transferred to a character on the same realm, faction and account.&quot;</div></div><hr />

What I'm trying to say is that, I like the changes they are making to help us level our alts, too bad heirloom items won't work on other realms factions. Would have been sweet with epic flying mount in northrend as lvl 68. ( yeah I allready got 7k gold as lvl 63) glyphs ftw!</div></div><hr />

Firstly, I won't be hunted down by Level 80s any more, as their alts can just mount and fly away. This is both good, as I won't die that often, but sad because I sorta enjoy it. Now, I will only be able to repeatedly gank &quot;new&quot; players, basically meaning I can gank those for all eternity. :D<br />

Secondly, this is a huuuge pull-factor for leveling a new alt. I like that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) You can get around without being limited by terrain<br />
2) You can avoid clumped mobs<br />
3) You can traverse zones much faster as you fly over any obstacles.<br />
<br />
Personally I think the changes they've been making to let folks level alts faster is great. As much as I enjoyed things the first time through I don't really feel that leveling is something I want to do. With all these changes I might even level an alt or two!<br />
<br />
I have to say that anyone with more than 1-2 80s has dedication I lack. Kudos to you for level grinding! My wife is nuts - she has 5 80s, all with Epic/CWF and several other alts. And I know people with more alts at 80. I guess it all comes down to doing what you enjoy. Some like to PVP, some like to Raid, some like to level alts, some like to craft, most like some combination of the above.</div></div><hr />

I think they're still following the model that they want players to 'experience' all the work the devleopers put into designing Northrend.* The goal isn't simply about getting to Dalaran, it's about forcing people to ride around these zones and see the sights.. instead of just flying all over it.<br />
<br />
By restricting it as a heirloom item purchasable only by a lvl 80, that means that user has, presumbly, &quot;stopped and smelled the roses&quot; already (although, haha, I rushed to 80 regardless my 1st time through).<br />
<br />

<br />
It requires you having a Level 80 Charectar to buy the thing. So Portaling a level 68 to Dalaran would not allow you to get the tome on the charectar.<br />
<br />
It's simply to help those who already have 80's level there alt's easier. Anyone who is new to the game will still need to wait until 77 to get cold weather flying.<br />
<br />
Seriously, there is a total fail of reading comprehension in this thread.<br />

Love it, leveling without flying was fun to do once and you can still do it if you don't want to fly, but I'm glad they give people the choice whether they want to fly or not. Which means I'll fly. A lot. A whole lot. From 68 on. Party time.</div></div><hr />

It should be an intense and challenging experience EVERY time. Unfortunately there is no challenge in levelling. It is the easiest and most boring thing in WoW. If levelling actually required that a player know his/her class then we wouldn't have retards doing 600 dps at level 80. I wish there were a challenge.

As the ppl said..maybe WoW is just not your game then. I know that ppl think fondly about games like Ultima, where you could make your own bread from harvested corn, get looted after somebody killed you...or lost XP...possibly even a level if you died to much. Apparently there is at least one game where a trained thief can even steal your equipped items...no afk anymore.<br />

<br />
What kind of idiot would I be to say I must trudge through everything I've already done twice (going on 5 times once the three 70's ding 80), on two seperate realms just so I can QQ about how boring it is running through stuff I've seen 5 times? Nope, not gonna happen.<br />
<br />
The changes do not make leveling easier, it makes it faster. It does not give me any special abilities or short cuts I didn't have before. It makes all that time between fights, between quests, between zones go faster and smoother. It makes it easier to avoid gankers.<br />
<br />
If you want to play the hardcore raider who does it all old school and slow as hell, good for you. Stop whining about ALTS getting it easier. This does not make it easier for a fresh player any more than it did when you were a newbie. The only advantage they get is a better refined combat system and mounts earlier so they don't have to spend more time getting to 80 than you did. Sure it's faster to level now than before but they added 20 levels to the game. It's no longer capped at 60.<br />
<br />
Most people who are playing are probably going to have at least one alt and they might decide to try a new class instead of being forced to level one all the way to 80 just to find out it's not for them. That is a huge time sink to waste just running everywhere. Back when there were 60 levels and the game was new, yes, it made sense not to have a ground mount at level 20 or flying at 60. Oh yeah, they didn't allow that til BC. So quit bitching already. Want to talk about L2P, how about L2STFU.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How asinine is that? They aren't making it easier to fight or breeze through your class. Equating this to easier leveling or giving &quot;hero&quot; status to alts is among the most incomprehensible comparisons I've seen made. Repeatedly. Every time patch notes are released.<br />
<br />
They make something less tedious and the first response is a knee-jerk comment about how they'll give you free 80's or start you at 55 or boost your XP gains (which they do, if you buy them from emblems with a level 80, thus defeating the complaint about newbies getting it easy). Any time they make it easier for someone to level alts, they make it obvious it's for someone who already made it to 80. You can't get anything for a lowbie that'll help them without already having reached 80 at least once. And it's never overpowered or even beyond the blue level of a weapon or armor.<br />
<br />
Can you say you honestly believe that Blizzard would make it that easy to just buy an 80 without effort? If you answer yes, please do cancel your subscription for real and go play something else that'll make you feel mighty with your hours of countless grinding and traveling by foot all over the damned countryside because you believe that's fun and a character building requirement.<br />
<br />
Having gone through it several times, the appeal and fun of leveling has been lost on me. I'm in it for the end game content and fun with my friends, not days (count up all those hours it took to level, it is countable in days) of lonely questing and grinding to make it to 80 just so I can play an alt with my friends and fill a different slot once in awhile. Not everyone wants to go through it again and again and not everyone will have time to repeat 70+ levels of tedium just so a few people can feel the &quot;epicness&quot; of leveling all over again.</div></div><hr />

RIGHT NOW: Every character loses the ability to fly once they hit Northrend. You cannot fly again until you reach level 77, when you buy Cold Weather Flying. So right now... NO FLYING FROM 70 TO 77.<br />
<br />
PTR: Once you get a character to 80, you can buy the scroll that enables an alt to be able to get Cold Weather Flying at level 68. So patch... YOU CAN FLY FROM 70 TO 80.<br />
<br />
This enables *alts* to fly the entire time from level 68 through 80. Alts will not have to use ground mounts from 70 to 77 like mains had to.<br />
<br />
Yes the cost is still 100g per character but they get to fly EARLIER and non-stop.</div></div><hr />

You'd think so wouldn't ya.... but 10+ pages and counting you'll read endless sob stories of how I've personally leveled 21 alts and paid 1k G for each and this is just so bad and game changing that... that... I just don't know if I can go on... this G19 keyboard is all stained with tears and now I'm getting shocks from it...<br />

Oh great BLIZ!!! look what you've done NOW!<br />

I'm in it for the end game content and fun with my friends, not days (count up all those hours it took to level, it is countable in days) of lonely questing and grinding to make it to 80 just so I can play an alt with my friends and fill a different slot once in awhile. Not everyone wants to go through it again and again and not everyone will have time to repeat 70+ levels of tedium just so a few people can feel the &quot;epicness&quot; of leveling all over again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not sure if you replied to the wrong comment or if you took my comment the wrong way, but I'm all for making it easier to get to 60 with alts. I've gone 1-70 4 times and if Blizzard did away with 1-60 tomorrow I'd do a dance on the spot. With another expansion on the way they really will need to seriously look at the 1-60 journey/hell.</div></div><hr />

Yes - you do.<br />

<br />
while i understand most people have an alt or two and probably gear a few of them in epics, i for one can say in tbc i had a main in high level gear, and two alts about a tier behind. with wotlk i have 3 toons equally geared almost and can have another two geared in the same fashion in 2-3 weeks. what does this mean? level another alt and do it again, or be bored and complain like the rest of the qqers.<br />
<br />
oh well, again since i've been leveling alts most of the time these are great, the reasons blizzard is doing it is kinda lame imo.</div></div><hr />

WG doesn't stack with heirlooms. The most you can get is 20% + Rested.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">newbish</div><div class="date">2009-07-09, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">a good idea, have to hit 80 with at least one character so takes away the feeling that everything is then a chore to achieve... if only they would implement a similar idea for when you hit exalted rep with a faction.

Now instead of getting a mage port to dal you can just have an 80 go and pick this up and mail it. That's it. You still have to pay the 1kg for it. This item really hasn't changed anything i don't get why people are saything is going to make leveling so much easier. Sure you get places a little bit faster but you still have to do the same amount of quests as before.<br />

<br />
Or at least make it part of the epic flying package....<br />
<br />
CW Flying 1000g or 10g if you have epic flying skill.<br />
<br />
That would be a nice compromise...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hallis</div><div class="date">2009-07-14, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think this is a good change. I've got 3x 80's already and have not bothered leveling up anything else as of late. Still have 2x 70's sitting in Borean right now. And I haven't played them because I didnt want to drudge through the same content again just running accross maps on a 100% mount. If this will make the grind to 80 a little faster so i can experience the raid content on my other classes then I'm all for it. Everything ive leveled so far have been hybrid toons like my Pally and Druid. Would be nice to level up my hunter that I havent touched since the expansion went live. But it just pissed me off that I had all the nice epic flyers (hell or even a flyer at all) that i couldn't use. So I'm looking forward to the changes. All you other QQing bitches are the same ones that QQ about everything else every single time patch notes are released. So fuck you to those guys/gals/unknown.</div></div><hr />

Not only do we get to avoid any inconveniences that would normally occur via ground mounts, but we get mounts earlier than ever. As long as we all keep complaining that alt-leveling is too (place complaint here) perhaps they'll enable us to teleport to each quest location and ask a local NPC to do all the work for us. Alt-lvling should be easy enough as it is now that we know what we're doing and where we're going, plus they ususally have a hefty amount of rested state that lasts through most of the process.. I had no problem running my little alt-asses around till lvl77. Even then I was too poor to afford epic flyers at the time..Oh wait! Dear Blizzard, make WoW easier please by handing out 100g epic flyers now, or just make gold grow on trees and allow a new gardening proffesion to grow it and hand it out. PLEASE MAKE WOW EASIER!</div></div><hr />

Stop playing wow because of a tome? It's not that bad that your 68+ alts can fly in Northrend, if you dont like it you can always keep your feet on the ground ^^</div></div><hr />

you train flying mount at lvl70 then you have to wait untill level 77 to actually use the damn fly mount? the worst thing blizzard added was the CWFlying thingy... we shouldnt even have to pay fro fly mounts in northrend ffs .....<br />

i think this is just bs,<br />
i leveld 2 chars to 80 now and 1 is at 75,<br />
<br />
i like it that you cant fly thill 77'ish<br />
<br />
i make you work harder to get to 77<br />
<br />

Perhaps work a little harder at Engrish and a little less at WoW???<br />

<br />
1) Why not just remove the 1000g price of Cold Weather flying altogether?<br />
<br />
2) You're letting the people that can afford the 1000g to just bypass the limit until 77 to fly in Northrend. That's a bit broken to me, and they should just lower the level cap instead IMO.<br />

Anyway, nice change, I'll probably buy this for my DK. :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
ye idling on that same alt in dalaran 2 weeks after hitting 80 because your full epic already is.. fun!<br />
<br />
ofc, you aint forced to use this crap, but like useal, will use it anyway.<br />

to bad leveling is a joke now, was kinda the only thing atm that kept me busy. ;(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now my 69 Paladin will buy 150% flying, and then get the Tome so I can fly around Northrend mining on her instead of my Shaman, for her JC needs.<br />
<br />
I used to be a bit OCD with trying to complete everything possible at the same time.<br />
<br />
But as others have said, pick something to want to achieve in WOW and stick to it.<br />
<br />
Complete it, pick something else and move on.<br />
<br />
You will find all stress evapourates and you will enjoy your time much more - try not to get jealous of people who have things you 'need' (read 'want').<br />
<br />
<br />
As for levelling, its never been hard and since the 1-60 XP nerfs its been faceroll, don't QQ if you can't put the time in but want the rewards.</div></div><hr />
