Legendary Staff - Smoldering Essence Droprate Stealth Nerf Confirmed<br />
One of the many stealth nerf deployed yesterday on live realms was a nerf of the questline to obtain Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71086/dragonwrath-tarecgosas-rest/), but not in a good way.<br />
<br />
The droprate of Smoldering Essences required for the Heart of the Flame (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/29307/heart-of-flame/) quest has been considerably lowered, you will now get about 50% less essences than before the nerf.<br />
<br />
<br />
For example, you will now get 9 or 10 essences from bosses in 25-Man Heroic mode instead of 17-19. <br />
Players in 10-Man Heroic mode will only get 3 or 4 instead of an average of 7. <br />
<br />
<br />
This change is surprising and might not be a good news for players, if Blizzard suddenly wants some parts of the game to last longer before the next patch. <br />
<br />
Just like any of yesterday's nerf to the firelands raid bosses, we don't have any comment or information from Blizzard at this point and the only comment is from a Blizzard QA poster who confirmed that this is indeed an intentional change.<br />
This was an intentional change, not a bug.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Simca</div><div class="date">2011-09-07, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This looks like a heroic-only nerf atm, btw.<br />
<br />
It brings the benefit of doing heroic modes to only very slightly above normal modes in terms of drops (10N drops 3 and 25N drops 8 VS 10H at 4 and 25H at 10).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gracin</div><div class="date">2011-09-07, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So that will pretty much put the 2nd 10man staff well into 4.3. That's cute.</div></div><hr />

I can't confirm it - but that's what the thread on the official forums states from a 25-man player who switched to normal afterwards - they still got 8 in normal, which is standard.</div></div><hr />

At least you're not on Failcrank (Fizzcrank). 2nd worst server in PVE progression in the world (take that Scryers!). I don't think we have any 25-man raids on our server.</div></div><hr />

That is a relief. My guild's players can be.... Disappointing to say the least, but I'd hate to leave them for progression. There's at least still hope for me to get my staff.<br />

<br />
It does kinda make sense.<br />
<br />
Having 2 legendary staffs in ONE ten man seems a little well .........un legendary. Remember the days when you couldnt just get a legendary by killing any boss you actually had to kill the hardest final boss after months and months of wiping and it was still on a REALLY low drop rate. <br />
<br />
Now its just kill the same bosses week after week (normal or hc we dont mind) and your whole guild can have a legendary staff.</div></div><hr />

On US-Mannoroth, DM was Dead Mines until Dire Maul was Patched in. Also, Dire Maul was always DM-East/West etc. I didn't see Dead mines called VC up until right before TBC. <br />

I think its a fair nerf for both 10 and 25m i was merely using 10 as a better example.<br />
<br />
If a 10m guild can be running around with 2-3 legendary by the end of the patch that seems very silly to me.<br />

Most servers would end up with 15~ legendaries</div></div><hr />

If you 10 man raiders dont like it, then RAID 25 MAN CONTENT. If you are thinking &quot;hey look at me, i want to be casual and still get the same awesome staff as the 25 mans get&quot; you need to gtfo, or do 25 mans. Legendary items are not for the casual / bad playerbase, get a clue.<br />
<br />
1) Not everyone has the luxuary of doing 25 mans<br />
2) 25 mans are probably easier for casuals as there are more people to cover for the slackers and bad players, which of course you can't do with 10 mans.<br />
<br />
But this isnt a 25 man vs 10 man thread and your elitiest views arent welcome here. Fact is 10 man is (meant to be) on equal terms as 25 man now, but as far as things like these changes go, its heavily unbalanced.</div></div><hr />

If a 10m guild can be running around with 2-3 legendary by the end of the patch that seems very silly to me.<br />
<br />
Most servers would end up with 15~ legendaries<br />

<br />
That was not even going to happen. Most 10 mans would finish just a little before 4.3 and most during it before this nerf. Guess what this means now?</div></div><hr />

I never said 10 wasnt hard, Im simply saying, if you want your staff quicker, then raid 25 man and stop complaining. This sort of whining and QQ proves that the casual community is only concerned about loot and gear. This is why attunements need to be brought back, this is why 10 and 25 man raids should be seperated (ie, no entering 25 unless you have 25 people, no 10 man equivalent of the raid)</div></div><hr />

As a long time 25m raider I just simply got tired of having 16-20 very solid players and 5 terribles who weighted the 25m raid down, When they released the same ilvl loot it was a easy choice to move to 10's with 9 other solid players and actually compete in Heroic content and have done very well.<br />
<br />
This change is ridiculous to say the least and is enraging lot of folks who already felt 10m got the short end of the stick on drop rates as is. I have been in on every boss kill since firelands released. Currently 4/7H and have killed at least 2-3 H bosses per week since week 3 of FL release. <br />
<br />
Still I only have 799/1k cinders and now hear the essences drops got nerfed into the ground? Seriously? When a 25m guild on my server who is just 1/7H and took almost 4weeks after FL to kill rag, and only killed 1heroic boss a week for almost a month, not only has their first 391 staff and almost done with the essences. But have another almost to their 391 staff with a third rdy to start cinders. <br />
<br />
Seems to be a bit of a disparity already and now this? I mean I'm ok with slowing it down or whatever, but I have to ask the question. Why even make a legendary we wont be able to use for current content except maybe a few weeks if that. Basically Seems like by the time I even complete our guilds first staff, 4.3 will be right around the corner if not already out with newer higher Ilvl gear. Will I replace the staff immediately? prolly not, but when new 397 400+ ilvl wpns are avl in next tier of content. I will be so happy i got to use my orange staff for like a month. until it becomes outdated like shadowmourne a and shiny bag token mount. <br />
<br />
Just seems if you make a legendary at least the first person eligible to receive one who has been clearing the content each week like clockwork should be able to get some damn use out of the orange pixels before it is reduced into a simple shiny mount</div></div><hr />

You're confusing 'difficulty' with 'tediousness.' Making it take longer has nothing to do with the difficulty. <br />
<br />
It's still easy, it's always been easy. The problem is, even though it's easy, it's tedious. They didn't make it harder to do, it's just as easy, all they did was make it significantly more tedious.</div></div><hr />

1) Having the ability to do 25 mans is not a &quot;luxury&quot; ANY player can participate in 25 man content now, because guess what.. theres NO attunements! (lol at your fail 1) logic) Also me saying that the 10 man casual community needs to stop complaining is hurting you why? And how does elitism come into the discussion at all? If you want your staff quicker, stop your qq, and join a 25 man raiding guild and get it quicker. It only proves that you and your casual community are all about gear, (which is what it was about all along) And no matter how much you think 10 man is &quot;on equal terms as 25 now&quot;, this is utter and complete horse shit. 10 man is still and always will be faceroll easy compared to 25... several people have confirmed this.</div></div><hr />

At most reports including myself at the current pace with the droprate nerfs, it will be late November even Xmas before our first staff is complete on 10m. SO they make a staff, that takes the better part of a year to make, so you can use it for a few weeks until it becomes outdated? Whats the POINT?. I mean you got folks from 25m guilds saying, &quot;Im not biast but I like this change&quot; OF Course your not bias given your sitting with your orange pixels in your lap laughing at everyone who is just starting essences or still in cinders. It's a simple matter of relevance at this point. Killing every boss since release being 4/7H 10m and still not seeing the staff until end of the year is quite frankly disheartening and makes you re-evalute the game blizz is producing compared to the games on the horizon.</div></div><hr />

Did you realize it this will take 10m guilds even longer? Here, I will direct you towards a chart prior to the nerf. http://www.wowhead.com/quest=29308#comments Scroll down a bit and you will see it. The nerf to 10m guilds was not necessary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Several people? Who? Paragon? Trying to claim because they spent 500+ wipes on raggy 25 man and spent much less on 10 man that that meant 10 man was easier? That's a fail in itself. Even if they used different tactics, they still knew what all the mechanics did inside out and didnt need to relearn anything.<br />
<br />
And how is my 1) logic a fail? Did you see my post earlier in this thread? I'm on a server with maybe 10-12 raiding guilds max, all of them 10 man's because getting 25 competent people together on my server is like expecting to crap gold after eating a kinder egg. So no, not everyone can participate in 25 mans so stop your ignorent &quot;rants&quot; about how you want the good old days back. <br />
<br />
Elitism? Your post is full of elitism. You seem to think your the mack-daddy of WoW and that because you do 25 man's, everyone else is a casual or a scrub. You brought the elitism to the discussion, not me. We're not whining about gear. We're complaining that Blizzard promised us equal opportunities at items such as these and those promises arent being met. By the time someone gets a staff from 10 man, 4.3 could very well be out and kicking. <br />
<br />
It's one thing to want loot handed to you, its another to want to be able to obtain loot when its actually relevent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is fail logic. Joining a 25 man guild now will take even more time than staying in a 10 man. Recipiants of the staff have been chosen long ago and new members will be of the least priority. Also, you seem to believe that getting this staff is difficult. It's not. It is nothing but a tedious time waster that has little to do with skill.</div></div><hr />

So 12 weeks for a 10 man with good rng on drops. 15 more weeks for the last stage with good rng and not missing a raid night. You're going to have a really hard time trying to convince me this is fine and making it live up to the name &quot;legendary.&quot;</div></div><hr />

I always hated when people talked about quitting wow, but I think I finally understand it. If one of my raiders on my 10m team quits, our server is so talent starved finding a replacement will literally be impossible. We can't 9m content, and one after another our whole team is going to quit.<br />

And to say that 25s are harder than 10 mans and vice versa. Blizzard wanted 10 and 25 mans to be EVEN and the SAME. Nuking the drop rates so that 10 mans take even longer than 25 mans, well, that's a bit screwed up. I personally like 10 mans due to the fact that when something goes wrong, we know who did what.

You've not read this thread at all did you? <br />
<br />
Fact is 25 mans were already making staffs are close to 3-4x faster than 10 mans and now this just makes it even slower. 25 mans who already have the staves are ok, they at least have 2-3 by now, whereas most 10 mans wont even have a single staff yet and as said earlier, without good RNG, can be waiting until october/november for their first ones.</div></div><hr />

I've already discontinued my subscription, and I'm 200 or so into the second phase of 1000.<br />
<br />
Look, the staff just takes too damn long to make. We clear 7/7 every week that we raid. We were 6/7 for the first two weeks, and then we've had Rag on farm since.<br />
<br />
The fact is, I'm already tired of this content. I've cleared it for two whole months of raids. In order to complete the staff, I have to make sure I show up and raid 7/7 every week for the next 2-3 months, or 5 months of doing the same exact raid every week, no breaks, no alts, no time off.<br />

<br />
I have read the thread. I do not see your point. I'm saying that it's fine for 25-mans to be getting the staff 2-3 times faster. One out of 15-16 (average) dps players gets it on 25-man, while 1 out of 5 (rarely 6) dps players gets it on 10man. I guess the optimal time for this nerf would be after the good 10man guilds had a good mathematical chance of getting one staff. If you claim that 25mans have 3 by now then mathematically 10mans should have one. <br />
Or maybe you are just comparing to 25man guilds that are/were higher in progression?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why? its the last item to get for most raiding guilds. Most guilds have had rag on pure farm mode for over 2 months. Im sure most guild members dont want to continue to pay for the game for the next 4 or 5 months while we wait for word on 4.3. I think its 100% reasonable for every 10 man guild, logging in only to get this staff to cancel their subs. Nothing stupid about it all. Seems pretty logical imo.</div></div><hr />

Yes, by half. Normal 10's give 1 or 2 essences. Making Stage 3 on regular 10 with an average of 1.5 essences, take almost 28 weeks with full 6/7 clears (Since rag gives none).</div></div><hr />

I understand that they want to limit the legendaries but HM guilds should be rewarded with more. I was in a 10 man at the beginning of FL and it is so biased against 10 mans it is rediculous at least let them get 1 staff, especially with farming out hard modes every week. The top 200 guild I went to JUST got the staff last week and they have been farming the HMs for a while. At current rate they were planning on 3 maybe 4 legendaries at best, now they will be very lucky to get more than 2. I guess I am just glad they got theirs last week and I really do have empathy for the 10 mans out there struggling to get a legendary. There are some very skilled 10 manners out there that deserve the legendary as much or more than many of the 25 man guilds out there. It is slight BS that a 10 man HM guild will be getting the same amount of legendary by 4.3 as a 4/7 Reg 25 man guild. <br />
<br />
Hopefully Blizz will reconsider but its unlikely given that they enjoy making players grind, it keeps the players coming back (it also contributes to the problem of burnout associated with an MMO this old)!</div></div><hr />

The staff was one of the few carrots remaining to counteract the stick of boring, tedious content - grinding daily quests for rep - and monotonous game-play. The fact is, not being able to change it up by playing alts has made the last two months of raiding fairly tedious. If it's no longer fun, why keep paying for it?

Legendary items are not for the casual / bad playerbase, get a clue.<br />
<br />
You got banned and rightly so. There's nothing casual or less &quot;hardcore&quot; about raiding 10 mans. A lot of boss fights have proven to be more difficult on 10 man because the way they are tuned and less room for stacking classes. We still have the same number of officers, loot system and no less effort goes into our raid week than a 25 man does. 25 man guilds make it seem like it's so much harder to organize. They're really not. If you're a serious raiding guild you're composed of adults who show up on time and prepared.The rest is just your raid leader explaining the strategy he wants to use. Still only have 1 of those in each raid team that spends the same amount of time researching .. .. /rant <br />
<br />
As far as the quest items go. Blizzard really screwed up all around on this one. It's already requires the most amount of time to acquire of any other legendary in the game, and now they're further lengthening it... seems kind of silly. This is a change that they should make when 4.3 comes out to discourage guilds from going back to continue getting them, not right now when we're 2 months in and 10 mans are barely halfway, while 25 mans have 3 or something silly.</div></div><hr />

They just realized that if they wanted to even come close to challenging the world first progression guilds, they would have to tune dps requirements for tier 13 to a raid containing what...a dozen legendary staffs? The top guilds are already running multiple raids to get as many legendaries as they possibly can. You can't really fault them for it, it's smart.<br />
<br />
This change was a weak attempt to slow them down, but in reality is too little too late, and only hurts the little guilds who only have the manpower for a single raid per week.</div></div><hr />

This is a total Blizzard oh shit moment. They just realized that if they wanted to even come close to challenging the world first progression guilds, they would have to tune dps requirements for tier 13 to a raid containing what...a dozen legendary staffs? The top guilds are already running multiple raids to get as many legendaries as they possibly can. You can't really fault them for it, it's smart.<br />
<br />
This change was a weak attempt to slow them down, but in reality is too little too late, and only hurts the little guilds who only have the manpower for a single raid per week.<br />
<br />
Yep. This, absolutely this. The real problem is that the staff is more powerful than any legendary they've ever done, and is usable by more specs than any previous (readily attainable and/or 'modern') legendary. Add in that they've made a habit of making most PvE encounters rather heavily favor ranged DPS over melee DPS and the problem is rather obvious.<br />
<br />
It does kind of suck for guys like me who joined a new guild in the last year or so. Most guilds are going to have a lot more people on their staff lists than they ever did for a shadowmourne or warglaives, so those of us that aren't on the top of the seniority/overpowered class of the content patch list end up feeling left behind for another four years until the next legendary caster weapon rolls around.<br />
<br />
E: Oh, and of course small ten man guilds that don't have the roster for a 25 or multiple 10 man runs get completely shafted (lolpun). Have fun trying to finish that before 5.0.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because they're expecting most people to stop caring about FL Raids as soon as they put 4.3 on the PTR.<br />
They nerfed the raid and they nerfed the rewards in kind. Would have been nice if they'd given some notice but it really wouldn't have made much difference if they did.</div></div><hr />

Would have been much better to nerf this from day 1 to keep 10/25m raids on the same level, this will end up having a much lower impact on a 25m guild going into the next content, but meh doesn't really matter a ton in the long run of staves made.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To my understanding, this is only H kills. How many casuals are in those kind of raids. This is effecting the real raiders who attempt Heroic Bosses every week and try to push up their server rankings. <br />
<br />
If they are going to nerf.. they should have given more for H kills and lower the Regular modes. Legendaries should be held by real raiders and not casuals. <br />
<br />
This would make real 10/25 raiding guild get staffs because they pushed Heroic bosses via Heroic Kills and let the others just be casual and casualy get their staffs.</div></div><hr />

Legendaries aren't meant to be a 5 second item. Hence legendary... And so what if 25s can get them a bit quicker. It's about time 25 mans had a reward given back to them. After all, the logistics of 25 mans is still harder and takes more time and effort to setup and co-ordinate. <br />

Look, the staff just takes too damn long to make. We clear 7/7 every week that we raid. We were 6/7 for the first two weeks, and then we've had Rag on farm since.<br />
<br />
The fact is, I'm already tired of this content. I've cleared it for two whole months of raids. In order to complete the staff, I have to make sure I show up and raid 7/7 every week for the next 2-3 months, or 5 months of doing the same exact raid every week, no breaks, no alts, no time off.<br />
<br />
Ahso on winterhoof-us, playtime done 9/19 and I'm probably not going to re-sub.<br />

Please no... I'd personally love to go back to 40 man raids. The large the raid size the more epic a kill feels... 10 mans are tolerable for cleanup when needed, but if I was doing 10-15 man full time, I'd sooner stab myself in the eye with a rusty fork.

Some of the shittier realms don't even have 40 level-capped raid-geared players on, prime-time. 40 mans have gone they way of the dodo. I think it's clear that they can't balance the rewards and challenges well enough between 10/25. They need to settle back on a single raid size.</div></div><hr />

Pretty much this but the timing of how it affects most 10mans seems too ironic to be a coincidence. My 10man had a rough start and I am about halfway with cinders so i'm looking at bare minimum another 4 1/2 months. Call me impatient but that's a tad ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

Think every DK on my server that raided had a lolmourne. 1000 souls, np, 25 geared raiding 10 all day baby. Oh no Caster staff will break the game if everyone has it!! This must be a pvp nerf lolz. Seriously though this does just make it a really boring grind. For everyone claiming legendaries are only for hardcorz 25manz and 10 man casuals should eat a dick are soooooo full of themselves. Please 25 man doesn't make you hardcore and it never has. I wouldn't be surprised to see 25 man go away in the next expansion totally. 25 man allows for more room for fail and is easier on healers. Healing 25 man is a joke compared to healing a 10man. There was only two fights where even paragon said 25 was harder and that was Baelroc and Rags because the enrage wasn't as scary. <br />
<br />
This nerf though is ruthless, 50% is a big nerf. They could have found a better solution. This does bring a boding foreshadow that 4.2 and 4.3 are going to be around for a long damn time. All I know is Blizz is really going to have to do something good for the next expansion and for their sake they better release the info at Blizzcon or this trend of dragging shit out is going to loose them a lot of subs. I don't care, been playing since classic and yet to get a legendary, Uludar I didn't do 25 on my healer and my lock is an alt now so he wouldn't have seen this one either. Thinking of going back and lol farming a shadowmourne on my DK. Too lazy for MC, AQ, BT. Sunwell wouldn't be bad but no bow user.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally, I think this points to 4.3 coming much later than anticipated. They know 4.2 raiding will go adios come 4.3. But if 4.3 is delayed an extra 2-3 months, teams will be sitting on several more legendary staffs than Blizzard anticipated. They have to slow the progression because 4.3 is nowhere near on schedule.</div></div><hr />

By this logic, it is obvious that 10man should be slower. I don't get the drama...<br />

10 mans are supposed to be a comparison to 25<br />
<br />
Yes I understand you can get the staff up to 3 times faster in 25man because there are more players in a 25man...<br />
But that doesn't change the fact that it takes a 10man guild 5months to collect the legendary <br />
And a 25man guild will have 3! by that time.<br />
<br />
This NRF isn't even the problem.... The understanding is that guilds shouldn't be getting legendarys until they are killing 7/7 heroic...because well lets face it... by 5months has come we will be killing Heroic RAG i'm sure.<br />
<br />
Make the Branch of Nordrassil better... Why?<br />
Well no one uses that junk... everyone is either getting the random drop rate heroic caster weapons, Heroic Venomspike or simply killing a heroic getting lucky getting a firestone and upgrading the BOE weapons... Even better killing reg RAG.<br />
<br />
Atleast make an item in the legendary chain equate to being somewhat related to a legendary...</div></div><hr />

Which is why I said that those running 10 mans should be greatful Blizzard decided to allow them to get legendaries.<br />
<br />
And it does have some merit to it. Blizzard could have made the gear levels the same but still kept legendaries restricted to 25 mans. But they didn't.<br />
<br />
You're right, they didn't. And all 10 man raiders came into this expansion thinking that. But with this nerf, I would've much rather been doing mediocre 25 mans as opposed to doing good progression in 10 man. As a 6/7 heroic guild, we will get our first legendary in 3 months. That's absurd.</div></div><hr />

It was bad enough that 10s drop less than 25s even though both have the same number of people that are going to be picking the essences up at a time (unless your guild is silly and is splitting them between two+ people who have the embers part finished, which would be stupid because that'll take even longer to get one finished).</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are different difficulties. You really don't understand that?<br />
<br />
Tier 11, 10man Raiding was harder than 25man, and in tier 12, 10man raiding is easier in that 25man.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably because they're 10M 6/7 or 7/7 HM, they've seen all the content, they've got all the gear, and they were just grinding out a staff or two for themselves or their buddies. By putting the staff out of reach, there's little incentive to keep grinding 4.2 content for months. Might as well take a few months off, play another game or save some $.</div></div><hr />

Fact is 25 mans were already making staffs are close to 3-4x faster than 10 mans and now this just makes it even slower. 25 mans who already have the staves are ok, they at least have 2-3 by now, whereas most 10 mans wont even have a single staff yet and as said earlier, without good RNG, can be waiting until october/november for their first ones.<br />
WTF 25m guild has 3? LOL. MAYBE MAYBE the extremely elite got their staffs and boss kills world 1st type guilds have 2. But the far vast majority of even good 25m guilds have 1 right now</div></div><hr />

There was a time in TBC where the then world's best guild didn't have one single Warglaive drop in over a year of killing Illidan. That guild was Nihilum.

<br />
So you have two ranged caster dps in your 10man raid?<br />
<br />
Most 25man raids have between 6-10.<br />
<br />
You are complaining that 25man raids are working on their second staff, while 10man raids haven't completed their first one. Well, once you complete a staff in 10mans, 50% of your caster dps will have the staff. Can you say that 50%(3-5 people) of caster dps in 25mans will have their staff? No, you can't.<br />
<br />
Most likely you will get another staff completed by the end of Tier 12, which will be 100% of your ranged dps getting the legendary, once again, you really think that 6-10 people in a 25man raid will get their staffs?</div></div><hr />

We have 4, and more that need to be rotated in for others. It's not that black and white. Just having 1 staff when it's in the relevant teir would be nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You've also got to consider the fact that the DPS increase in getting a single staff (while a lower percentage of overall raid dps in 25) is pretty significant. AND to actually be able to have the benefit of 1-3 for ACTUAL progression is where the disparity in 10 vs 25 is coming from. 10 mans will see staves very late into tier12 when progression will be slow or non-existent.</div></div><hr />
