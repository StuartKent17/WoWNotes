Sindragosa<br />
The frostwyrm featured in the video is most likely (as in &quot;not officially confirmed&quot;) Sindragosa. Little is known about her for the moment but through datamining we already know that she holds the title of &lt;The Frost Queen&gt; in game and is very closely related to Arthas. One of the subzone of Icecrown Glacier is also named Sindragosa's Fall. (Screenshots of the model of Sindragosa were obviously taken on a non-official server as Icecrown isn't available on live servers for the moment)<br />

Tom Chilton and J. Allen Brack interview on buffed.de<br />
Getbuffed.com (http://www.getbuffed.com/getbuffed/videos/show/5) also posted an interview of J. Allen Brack (Production Director) and Tom Chilton (aka. Kalgan, Lead Game Designer), it's shorter than the one from gamona (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=13408.0) but we still learn a bunch of new things on Icecrown and Arthas. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;div&gt;&lt;object width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;357&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.dailymotion.com/swf/kiA0DQDuBR16mOJLNL&amp;related=0&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowScriptAccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.dailymotion.com/swf/kiA0DQDuBR16mOJLNL&amp;related=0&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;357&quot; allowFullScreen=&quot;true&quot; allowScriptAccess=&quot;always&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br />
<br />
What can we expect from the currently closed zones in the Beta?<br />
J.A.B: Icecrown is the home of the Lich King. So you'll see the seed of the scourge power. So there will be lots of different scourge things that happens there. Eventually there will be an actual raid to face the Lich King. That will not be when we release Wrath of the Lich King. That will be later on. In Storm Peaks we actually have two different dungeons, that are based on the titans, which are the creators of Azeroth. The next dungeon to open will be the Halls of Lightning.<br />
<br />
T.C.: In Icecrown Glacier, theres something a little bit different that players may not have seen before, which is the Horde and Alliance quest hubs are actually gunships that are flying above the zone. Theres an Alliance gunship and a Horde gunship which are sorta the quest hubs.<br />
<br />
J.A.B.: The idea behind it is, the Icecrown glacier is so full of the scourge, that neither the Horde or the Alliance have been able to get a toehold, and to create an actual base. So they've actually flown these goblin and gnomish engineering vehicles up and they act as the quest hubs.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Halls of Lightning are also closed. What awaits us in there?<br />
J.A.B.: The Halls of Lightning is the second of the titan dungeons that we'll be releasing with Wrath of the Lich King. I did a playtest of Halls of Lightning last week and its coming along real well, looks really cool. The art style for it is very good, very exciting. It looks other-worldy. It definitely has a lot of other worldy kind of influences. The architecture that the titans have is really different from the Horde and Alliance architecture. So it just looks very ancient, very powerful, very titan'ish.<br />

Tanking in Wrath of the Lich King<br />
We *will* give you the tools to do it. We just might not give you those tools the same way another class gets them. There are no two-handed tanking weapons, yet I suspect 50% or more of DKs will use two-handed weapons. Neither DKs nor druids have shields. Druids need defense less than other tanks because they can achieve crit immunity. We can do something similar for your damage reduction (bake it into bear form, or put it in a talent are two obvious choices). Now, when you get your leather though, we are assuming you gem and enchant it as a tank would.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry we are neglecting paladins on the forums. None of the tanking trees are very far along yet, and ironically the DK ones are probably the most stable. The paladin ones may be the least stable since the class changed so much, so it's hard to offer a lot of comment on specific talents right now. I mention druids a lot because we are talking a lot about them right now. The Arms and Fury warriors recently got some really nice work done on them, so hopefully Prot will follow. (But again I stress we won't know if the talent trees offer all of the threat, mitigation, survivability and tools they need to until we compare endgame tanking more.)<br />
<br />
As far as what the Prot warrior brings to a raid, it is true that all tanks bring some ammount of target debuffing. But more importantly, we are in the middle of a pretty big analysis of raid buffs and debuffs. It is a large enough topic that we probably shouldn't muddle up this thread too much of that discussion, but in brief:<br />
<br />
The overall goal is that you should want to bring raiders because they are your friends or because they are very good players, not because their buff is so awesome that you can't live without it. We would like you to be able to get all of the big buffs and still have some remaining slots that you can fill how you want (you know assuming you have enough healers and CC or whatever). We would like to get things to where no single spec always justifies a raid spot because their buff is impossible to replace or live without. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/8765643774-tanking-in-wrath-of-the-lich-king.html))<br />
<br />
Tanking in Wrath of the Lich King and Itemization<br />
No class should need an awesome set of tank gear for a L76 dungeon. Once you get close to 80 and start to talk about heroics, then you absolutely need some good blue tanking gear, and that kind of stuff is available as drops and quest rewards.<br />
<br />
Our early tests suggest DK mitigation, avoidance and health aren't far below other tanks (assuming those tanks are using similar gear and aren't coming in with Sunwell epics). Their avoidance tends to be a little higher and stamina a little lower, but not significantly (and I should stress that these are very preliminary tests). It could be that the mobs just hit too hard.<br />
<br />
One change we made recently is baking in the old bonus from Blessing of Salvation into tanking forms. Up until now you were pretty much just doing without the old Salv because there was no way to replace it, and many raiding guilds will tell you that buff is (was) mandatory. Now you get it for free.<br />
<br />
That obviously won't help survival much, but it will affect threat enormously. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/8537883754-death-knight-tanking-impressions.html))<br />

Feral Tanking and Itemization<br />
I totally get this. Druids won't be popular tanks if everyone knows them as the OOM tank. When I say &quot;big health pool&quot; I'm not talking about 30% more than a warrior, and I'm not even sure that's the route we'll go. But since the &quot;big health&quot; idea generates a lot of discussion, I'll walk you through our thought process.<br />
<br />
Druids are going to have a harder time hitting the armor cap in Lich King largely because there is no leather tanking gear, and virtually no bonus armor at all (except on a few pieces like rings and necks). Now we can't just make druids do without armor, or they won't compete with other tanks. We can't just bake the armor into Dire Bear Form though, or we risk making resto druids even better in PvP. So when I have mentioned big health pools, that is partially because we're trying to solve the problem where druids need armor but can't get it. Big health is a way to do with less armor, but it's not a total fix for the situation, it definitely has drawbacks, and it doesn't mean 30% more health and 30% less armor. If I had to guess, all of the tanks will end up having pretty similar endgame stats, minus obvious things like block.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind how good a well-geared druid tank would be in live if we hadn't added Sunwell Radiance. It is surprisingly easy to make bears too good or not good enough. We have to tread carefully.<br />
<br />
But we haven't changed the design of wanting bears to be able to MT. And that doesn't mean technically they can MT but all the healers complain and as soon as the warrior logs on, you eagerly swap him back in. MT means MT.

Roar of Sacrifice making hunters invulnerable / Pet survavibility in WotLK<br />
Obviously Roar of Sacrifice is a bug.<br />
<br />
The burst issue is one worth more discussion. We have hesitated giving resilience to pets because to some extent we do want them to be killable. When you're the other team all ganging up to kill a pet while enduring tons of damage from the hunter, it can feel like a long time, and then the hunter just turns around and brings the pet back.<br />
<br />
One thing we're not crazy about is the pet-as-guided-missile strategy that some hunters seem to employ (send your pet in, then ignore it the rest of the fight.) You should want to heal your pet and otherwise try to keep it alive and not just use it as a delaying tactic.<br />
<br />
Now I'm not saying pets are already too tough, just that we don't want to get them that way, which is why we haven't gone the resilience route yet. But I would be interested in hearing more discussion about how much more health a pet would need to feel like they weren't getting one-shotted. Alternately, maybe talents that affected chance to be crit (or granted something on being crit) would be more appropriate. If in the end you think resilience is the only thing that will keep the pet alive, let us know that too.

<br />
Pet's Charge changes<br />
It's not a game balance issue really. We wanted to make the tanking pets feel different from the DPS pets by having one Charge and one Intervene.<br />
<br />
It might make sense to swap Dash / Dive with Charge / Swoop though for tanking pets. They might have to be on the same cooldown.... We'll think about it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/9023656642-boars--charge-the-now-lost-fun-factor.html))<br />

Wolf: Furious Howl<br />
I'm not sure why Furious Howl had such a low range. My suspicion is it just hadn't been touched in a long time. It's 40 now. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/8765584820-feedbackwolf-skill--furious-howl.html))<br />

Protection paladins in WotLK<br />
It's great to see your feedback on protection paladins. This is really useful because we feel we may still have further work to do on them for Wrath. Because of all the paladin changes we've made, the prot paladin is probably a lot less good to go than other tanks -- especially the Death Knight which has had to receive a lot of attention since it's a brand new class. We're looking forward to seeing how protadins are looking in the endgame, because until then we won't really know if you've got all the stats and tools you'll need to do fully champion your intended role and speciality.

Scourge Strike / Upcoming changes<br />
<br />
I am personally not convinced Annihilation is mandatory. If you remove diseases with Obliterate, you can reapply them again with Icy Touch and Plague Strike. The only time it feels really necessary is if you are Frost and want to get two Oblits in a row, or you are in a raid sitation where you can't afford to let Ebon Plague fall off.<br />
<br />
At this point, we are leaning towards Scourge Strike as an Obliterate replacer that hits for Shadow damage and doesn't remove diseases. With it, you wouldn't need Annihilation as Unholy so that point is moot. You would still have Plague Strike (and Blood Plague in general) for the hot removal effect.<br />
<br />
Desecration would be changed to work off Plague Strike, since the compulsion is to open with it anyway. All other talents that currently affect Plague Strike and Scourge Strike would continue to do so.<br />
<br />
Then we'd add a talent that converts Blood Runes used in Blood Boil to Death Runes. Blood Boil's AE damage feels good for Unholy. It has already been changed to a non-taunt with no cooldown, so it is basically an AE Blood Strike.<br />
<br />
With this new talent you could do:<br />
Icy Touch (F) -&gt; Plague Strike (U) -&gt; Scourge Strike (FU) -&gt; Scourge Strike (FU)<br />
<br />
That one is a little like Frost. But with Epidemic, you could sometimes do:<br />
Scourge Strike (FU) x3<br />
<br />
And if you had Corpse Explosion and / or Bone Armor, you could sometimes do:<br />
Icy Touch (F) -&gt; Plague Strike (U) -&gt; U -&gt; U -&gt; Scourge Strike (FU)<br />
<br />
The Unholy Blight idea is interesting too, but we finally got the current version in a place where it feels fun, so we are inclined to keep it there. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/9023784522-suggestion-upgrade-scourge-strike.html))<br />
<br />
Heart Strike and Improved Icy Touch bugs<br />
I wouldn't be at all surprised if Heart Strike's debuff wasn't working correctly. There was also a bug with Improved Icy Touch increasing haste instead of decreasing it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/9023786960-heart-strike-findings-blue-please-reply.html))<br />

Yeah me too, it's a little bland compared to what we're used to seeing. It would've been awesome if it was just the intro or outro for the trailer, pretty much how the Illidan part at the end of TBC trailer was.<br />

What I got from it, is that those are questions asked by the members of their site, so you can't blame them if their users come up with retarded questions.</div></div><hr />

The punchline comes at the end. The concept of having King Terenas tell his dreams about his son and seeing how they turned out as he would've wanted but in a very dark and twisted way is nicely done, but it just lacks the rush the previous cinematics used to give you. Like I said, it would've been the perfect intro or outro of the cinematic, with the other part being the old school scenario of seeing most of the races fighting/preparing for battle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree to a certain extent.<br />
<br />
The soft, serene and almost mourning music in this cinematic does its job perfectly along the narrator in capturing the dichotomy what has become Arthas, the Lich King.<br />
<br />
Sure, it's not action packed, but really, every trailer has to be a blockbuster movie ?<br />

A trailer is meant to entice viewers, and tbh, this was successful. The previous WoW cinematics were just random fighting that could be from any game, much like the WAR cinematic. This at least tells a story, and cleverly so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
J.A.B.: The idea behind it is, the Icecrown glacier is so full of the scourge, that neither the Horde or the Alliance have been able to get a toehold, and to create an actual base. So they've actually flown these goblin and gnomish engineering vehicles up and they act as the quest hubs.<br />

<br />
Atleast I was right on the part that it would be a zeppelin and a flying steamtank.<br />
<br />
I like them both, the horde one got a huge bomb loading mechanism that shows on the top deck. The dual zeppelin looks kind of cool.<br />
Alliance one look bigger, but it might not be. I also like the cannons sticking out of it :)<br />
<br />
I hope they will move around in the zone and not just be hovering the same spot.</div></div><hr />

I think you may have watched the cinematic without sound.<br />

Sindragosa's Fall... well obviously this is where the blue dragon Sindragosa &quot;fell&quot; as in died, maybe while flying, and was frozen into the ground. Well, until Terenas' offspring came.</div></div><hr />

Frostmourne claims souls, and Arthas killed Terenas with Frostmourne. So it may not be just a story pun to hear Terenas' words while Arthas awakens Sindragosa (and by this apparently raises the undeads'... whatever they have that equals morale)<br />
or<br />
the souls of the ones killed by Frostmourne are trapped in the blade, forever trapped in their memories, and maybe the Lich King can &quot;playback&quot; any memory at will*, for his amusement or, in this case, to 'highlight' the events in the cinematic, which of course contradict yet confirm Terenas' words.<br />
<br />
* maybe kinda like Dread's &quot;music&quot; in Otherland (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otherland)</div></div><hr />

Fully agree, the cinematic is full of Irony and it fits perfectly with Arthas story.<br />
is just awesome just to hear the voice of King Terenas Menethil II<br />
saying: <br />
&quot;My child...I watched with pride as you grew into a weapon...of righteousness.&quot;<br />

<br />
The trailors (at least the past two) are about the new things in the game, not lore. The game is going into the future, not the past. We are creating lore while we play. Besides the ashbringer is in the DK quests(dont wanna spoil it but there you go). This is showing arthas and who we have to face. So what if there are no races fighting, that was because in the last 2 parts of the game:<br />
THe first was the release of the game and it showed most of the playable races.<br />
The second one(bc) showed the two new races and outlands PLUS illidan.<br />
Now this one is showing arthas and the voices in his head, lol. But no new races, just a new class. The DK is going to be epic and they probably dont wanna include it. But this one was good.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Knyx</div><div class="date">2008-08-21, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very cool cinematic. I prefer it over the previous ones.<br />
<br />
While I will admit that the WoW and BC cinematics were more &quot;dazzling&quot; due to the special effects and the action sequences, I thought the WotLK trailer was much more fitting.<br />
<br />
Previous cinematics have just been a random grouping of scenes intended to highlight a particular class and what they can do. They made very little reference to the story itself. They could have been cinematics for any game. Look at the BC cinematic. It's just some random scenes and then &quot;Oh, by the way, Illidan's here too. Say hi Illidan. He thinks you aren't prepared.&quot;<br />
<br />
This one made no bones about why you are going to Northrend. <br />
<br />
&quot;Here's Arthas. He's a bad mamma jamma. Some bad shit's about to go down and he is the one responsible for it. He has a dragon, and an army of undead. Go get him.&quot;<br />
<br />
I think it did a lot more to set the tone for the upcoming expansion than any of the previous ones did.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dukamok</div><div class="date">2008-08-21, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most of the people who didn't like the trailer probably have no idea what's going on in it or what's behind it (NAMELY the voice of King Terenas). I think this works much better as a CINEMATIC trailer for the game itself and the story, rather than the plain old random everything fighting everything crap (how could people &quot;miss&quot; that?)<br />
<br />
Oh and graphically it's incredible as well. &quot;No special effects like in the last 2&quot; my ass.</div></div><hr />

Could you expalin what is to be desired? <br />
Lemme guess: random fighting between horde and alliance, random fighting against Undead, and random death knight duels. This game isn't all about pvp and fighting, its also about continuing lore and the game evolving. This suits northrend, it gives an intro to the lich king, frost wyrms and the lich kings vast undead armies. IMO this is way better than their past two.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Very much so a Blue name. Madrigosa, Tyrigosa, et al. I doubt Arthas would have any sway over him, bar maybe a grudge for having yet another Blue Dragon as a Frostwyrm, Sapphiron being the first named one we saw.<br />
Malygos' reasons for turning on the magic users of the world tho' is supposedly due to the problems such magic wielders have caused:<br />
<br />
First Invasion by the Burning Crusade and the eventualy Sundering of the world.<br />
More Invasions by the Burning Crusade.<br />
The war between the High Elves of Silvermoon and the Amani Trolls.<br />
Various other wars.<br />
<br />
It's like a bigger case of a parent letting the kids take the car one evening and coming back to find a smoking wreck in the garage.<br />
<br />
Additionally, taken from WoWwiki;<br />
<br />
<br />
Most Blues have names ending in &quot;gos&quot;, or &quot;gosa&quot; for females. Sometimes synonyms of the word &quot;blue&quot; find their way into a blue dragon's name as well.<br />
<br />
Much like the Red Flight uses strasz for males and strasza for females.<br />
<br />
So, sadly, yet another Blue falls, and the Flight becomes smaller and smaller.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There doesn't need to be any fighting. Not even one alliance/horde banner for that matter. Like a previous poster said, there is no catchy quote. Even the &quot;everyone serves the one... true... king&quot; might have worked. <br />
<br />
Also, there is no lore explanation of anything. You may recognize who is talking and what happened, but for people that doesn't know anything about Arthas might as well think that his father was another Lich King. The intro barely shows his Scourge army with blue stuff frothing our of their mouths. <br />
<br />
The only action was the dragon been awaken/resurrected/whatever. Every other character in that intro was almost standing still. Even Arthas just stands there looking at Frostmourne for seconds before he does any other movement. There is nothing that can attract the larger audience. There isn't anything that can get everyone all pumped like TBC intro did. <br />
<br />
Like I said, there doesn't need to be any of the classes to make an awesome intro. To give you an example, with the same audio of his father talking in the background, they could have resumed the life of Arthas from his birth to how he became the Lich King and end the way it ended. Or his father talking to him at the craddle and then ending the way it ended with at least some catchy phrase or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So in one hand we have a cinematic of the 2nd expansion (and almost a &quot;the end&quot; for a long plot that started in WC3) and on the other hand we have a cinematic of a NEW game that looks similar the cinematic from old-WoW when it was NEW.<br />
<br />
The time for WoW to show it's classes, their powers, etc... passed... let it for the new games that need to show it (WAR), they're finishing a storyline. Don't forget, we're used to DKs in WoW, they're just playable now (have we ever saw a Draenei or &quot;real&quot; Blood Elf and their cities in old WoW?).<br />
<br />
Looks like ppl want the cinematic to show more in-game stuff that they can't see 'cause they're not playing the beta. The cinematic isn't for that. Keep reading mmo-champion and other sites for beta info.<br />
<br />
I don't remember TBC cinematic (btw, the cinematic of the 1st expansion after a long wait! They needed to make it &quot;common! come back to WoW! It's full of action for everyone again!&quot;) showing Tempest Keep, Black Temple, Hellfire Citadel, Mag, Gruul... Just the two new races and the atmosphere of their cities (remember, new races, new cities, like old-wow cinematic remember?), then they're just doing random fights in what looks like some of the OL places and then the crazy one mumbling about not beeing prepared showing his powerfull wings.<br />
<br />
So WotLK cinematic show way more of the reason for xpac to exist (Arthas), his story (that could be done in TBC about Illidan), the irony of it (the prince that become not exactly the King that his father wanted) and, guess what, probably most of what we'll see in northend, snow :)<br />
<br />
Remember that The Lich King was way too quiet in Northend and we didn't knew why... that's why... a huge army getting ready to take Azeroth (don't forget the info about LK attacking Azeroth in the event for the launch of WotLK).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here we have an example of side A, the lore fans who enjoy scenery, take their time leveling, read the full quest, and probably a few RPers somewhere in the crowd.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I do fully agree with all people here, stunning graphics and I love that exotic music with the woman singing (LOTR-wise) but I wanted to see something more than just Icecrown; where is the jungles of Sholazar Basin, where is Valgarde, the Tuskarr from Borean Tundra and where is the ancient Dwarf fortress of Ulduar??<br />
<br />
I pray to Blizzard they make 2 cinematics........(maybe this was just a sneak peek?)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Here we have an example of side B, the ones who likes the jumping, sword-swinging orc from TBC's trailer, who grinned at the dwarf shooting his rifle and sending the bear to the tauren from WoW's first trailer.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, it's a different trailer. I would've liked to have Sindragosa fly instead over a mass of Scourge vs Alliance/Horde, with the Lich King watching silently above. I would've liked to have him catch a glimpse of one of the death knights who turned, who now fight along side the mortal races (and some fancy special effects to follow from a DK move). Would I have preferred more out of this trailer? Yes. Am I dissatisfied with this trailer? Hell no, it looked great. It's just not Blizzard's usual style.<br />
<br />
Oh, and for all those who were talking about moving to the future, into WotLK, other trailers showed the future areas as well. The difference is that this one, much like 2.4 and 2.1's trailer, showed a glimpse of the future while talking about the future's backstory. Blizzard's new style, it seems.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I agree, those are the reasons Malygos is doing what he is doing. But what suddenly got him into action? Is Arthas posibly behind it? Im not saying Blizz wouldnt just put Malygos in as an adversary untill they unlock Arthas as a final boss, but they usually have contiunity to tie things together.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's exactly what I'm talking about. <br />
<br />
One of the reasons why I'm dissapointed with the WotLK intro is because it doesn't motivate you to play it if you are a new gamer. We know who Arthas is, who is talking in the background and what we are expecting from him and his army because we have played WoW for years. Some of us have even played the old warcraft games. But those who will look at WoW for the first time won't understand what's going on. <br />
<br />
At least in the WAR intro you see armies fighting each other, so you expect huge battles with their unique, but the same time similar classes countering each other. In the WotLK you see some guy in plate with a really nice sword defrosting a skeletal dragon and an army of undead getting all pumped.<br />
<br />
I don't know. Maybe I was expecting something a little more... motivating, or even longer. Don't get me wrong, it is a really nice piece of work. But is just not enough. It doesn't show anything to the player other that he is a king and is forming an army of undead.<br />
<br />
btw... if the zone where the Scourge is is supposed to be so full that both horde and alliance have flying hubs, then his army in the intro should have been more impressive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In no cinematics have they ever gone and shown towns for example, i'm not sure how you can ask for them, in tbc cinematic they show random fighting because they had nothing truly epic to show, and then they showed Illidan 'you are not prepared'.<br />
<br />
In this one they have the epic armies and then finally they show the lich king looking awesome, i'm really not sure why anyone wants to see cinematics of things they have already seen screenshotted from the beta.<br />

New gamers won't play a game that doesnt interest them.. ie: they see this trailer on youtube most viewed -&gt; think its well made cgi, but go *shrug* i'll go play that game with the hot evil elf almost making out with the hot not-so-evil elf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
its an INTRO. A lot of you are disappointed in the &quot;trailer&quot; and think it would be better as an &quot;intro&quot;... Well it is!!<br />
<br />
another thing, its more than 30 seconds longer than the TBC cinematic. <br />
<br />
Stop whining, this video delivers</div></div><hr />

<br />
WoW Cinematic - Introducing us to the World (for those that hadn't played the original games)<br />
TBC Cinematic - Attempting to explain the fact we're going to a foreign power ranger world<br />
WotLK Cinematic - Reminding you that there is a story line behind the game.<br />
<br />
I don't particularly wanna see the same old classes fighting. i've seen it all before in the other cinematics. I wanna see the Lich King, I did and a lot more.<br />
<br />
I can't wait! Bring on Northrend!<br />
<br />
P.S. I don't care if this trailor attracts new players. I'm not a new player and I really could care if Blizzards 13 million subscribers goes up.</div></div><hr />

You mean Broken/Lost ones? And they were also part of the Alliance (and Warriors, Paladins, Hunters...)? LOL<br />

What's next? &quot;I saw Velen in westfall kicking some defias before TBC was announced&quot;. :)</div></div><hr />

Well, first off, it's an early preview of the opening cinematic, not an advertising campaign. The opening cinematic of a game is generally not intended to draw in new players.<br />
<br />
Second, WoW is almost 4 years old and creeping up on 2 expansions. The game is at the height of its popularity, having transcended video game culture and entering into the realm of pop culture. If people aren't interested by now, they never will be.</div></div><hr />

Imho, it wouldn't be a lot better with a combat, if better at all.<br />
<br />
The ironic twists of Terenas Menethils flashback speech, the emerging of the frost wyrm, the overlook of the scourge forces, the music, the atmosphere.. all perfect.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aetius</div><div class="date">2008-08-21, 08:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The punchline comes at the end. The concept of having King Terenas tell his dreams about his son and seeing how they turned out as he would've wanted but in a very dark and twisted way is nicely done, but it just lacks the rush the previous cinematics used to give you. Like I said, it would've been the perfect intro or outro of the cinematic, with the other part being the old school scenario of seeing most of the races fighting/preparing for battle. <br />
<br />
<br />
Agree with this completely. Visually awesome, loved the music and King T's voice talking about Arthas but there is nothing else to it. The part with the Frost Wyrm? why did they put that in, when up to this point, no one had really cared about it. <br />
<br />
The point is to draw hype, so why not put in stuff people can relate to and get pumped about. I always thought it was cool how they had quick flashes to the different faction/race/classes and them doing battle. <br />
<br />
Also agree that this should be like an intro or an outro of the trailer, just like some eye candy to go along with another trailer. Music, voice, and visuals were awesome...just feel like its more of a video about arthas instead of us trying to become more powerful and doing battle with him or his minions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's where you're wrong. This was not a promotional teaser. This is the actual opening cinematic of the game. The point of it is not to draw hype. It's to give you something to watch when the game loads up to set the tone. <br />
<br />
Releasing it early was probably to build hype, and we can debate whether or not they should have released it early as a hype machine. But the cinematic itself? Not made with &quot;hype&quot; in mind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
and that's good, <br />
because they didn't have to make it all flashy (well, imho the dragon and the runeblade thing with the snow-crystals fallin onto it were pretty awesome), but instead make you think back, about what had happened in the past, remember the storyline AND, for those who want to make something hyped (i personally think that deathknights are already super-hyped, for instance the last fanarts were almost all dk's), is the dragon. i personally don't know what role she (if it is the dragon every1 talks about) might play, so here's something to think about.<br />
<br />
what did you have to discuss about the bc and vanilla intros?<br />
<br />
edit: could've been a bit longer tho, seriously. But we all know, blizz-cinematics are short</div></div><hr />

the graphics as usual were well done though, just full of fluff. ( maybe that's what were supposed to look forward too)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love the video, I think it's awesome. Maybe it's b/c I know the lore and am already excited for it.<br />
<br />
For the Warhammer people, good riddance. I don't think Blizzard will miss you much, they have a few subscribers already. See you all back in about 3 months (it takes a while to admit you're wrong or it would most likely be sooner).</div></div><hr />

<br />
that.<br />
<br />
About the Warhammer trailer, it's actually kinda ridiculous, showing off how one class can kill another, not really interesting. Tells me that &quot;WAR&quot; will be more about posing and acting cool then about actual story and immersion.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azerek</div><div class="date">2008-08-21, 11:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Left no plot to base an expansion off, all it is is Arthas summoning a frost wyrm and stirring up his undead army, and a narrating force showing the irony of the situation. <br />
<br />
I went back and watched TBC cinematic and was much more pleased, gave me goosebumps infact. It gave a plot, showed what was implemented and threw some action in there was well as some sinister drama. This one was just more of something cool to watch. Granted, the CGI was awesome and the slowmo was a cool effect (be it wasted on watching snow fall to frostmourne, should've been used on the dragon or something).<br />
<br />
If this &quot;It's not a trailer, it's and intro&quot; story is true, I'd say I was alot happier, because this would make an awesome intro to a bigger cinematic, but as a full cinematic itself, no dice.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">yarai</div><div class="date">2008-08-22, 12:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cinematic was visually stunning, but I didn't shiver or grin when I watched it. I love Arthas as a character and all, but the scripting felt like it was building up to a sort of &quot;Well, that's what Arthas did, so this is how players will respond: queue the montage, Jimmy!&quot; Instead, I felt like, &quot;Okay...so where do I fit in all of this?&quot;<br />
<br />
One of the reasons why I felt the previous two cinematics worked was all the action and the fact that they included &quot;player characters&quot; doing cool things. Plus, it's fun cheering your faction on. I mean, c'mon. The orc in TBC sliced the naga in half. And then the BE priest had insta-res.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I understand what he says (maybe 90%) but some words are difficult like &quot;Righteousness&quot; and some others.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fablewynd</div><div class="date">2008-08-22, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought it was absolutely amazing! :O Blizzard has really outdone themselves, and, thank God, they have gotten back to do cinematics with an actual storyline. The original WoW, and in a lot of ways the TBC one was simply a pretty cinematic, showing a load of characters using different abilities, big woop (-_-&quot;) Yes you had the little narrative of Illidan on the TBC one, but the original Warcraft 3 movies were brilliant, they were masterfully done and they told a small part of a story.<br />
<br />
I am so glad they didn't stick in some token characters using new spells from the expansion to pad it out, they stuck, soley on Arthas and made him the centre of the expansion, which is the main thing. From what I have seen so far on the Beta, and what has been disclosed already, this expansion will be a story, everything will bleed into everything else and the lore will be much more prevalent, all building up to a creshendo with Arthas. That is what WoW has lacked, a story, a purpose. Illidan is all well and good but he is hardly a mastermind badass villain who could actually wipe out the world if he wished to.<br />
<br />
lol, and I keep thinking King Terenas, at 1:36 is gonna do a whole Mufasa/Lion King &quot;Remember! Who, you, are!&quot;<br />
<br />
I just hope they do Arthas justice. Illidan was such a disappointment really, in terms of lore. Arthas is such a massive lore figure, and such a massive power that even the Burning Legion feared him. It is sad that the Icecrown/Lich King raid will be both a 10 man and 25 man, because the thaught of 10 people defeating the Lich King is pretty upsetting.<br />
<br />
The cinematic has captured what it needed to capture, and it told a story. What I loved about it, and what I also loved about the TBC cinematic, was that it payed homage to the old cinematics, in that when Illidan is speaking, it re-used his theme music from the TFT intro movie, and just with this new movie, Arthas' theme music from the end movie from TFT is used again. Little things like that just show Blizzard is a company that goes the extra mile in terms of history and development.<br />
<br />
I think Blizzard is making a massive mistake not doing the Warcraft Movie in its trademark CGI graphics. <br />

For English&lt;=&gt;French, you could go the long way and use LEO, a great German&lt;=&gt;many languages translator ;)<br />
Like, look up what &quot;righteousness&quot; means in German (http://dict.leo.org/?search=righteousness), and then translate &quot;Rechtschaffenheit&quot; (http://dict.leo.org/frde?search=Rechtschaffenheit) to French :P</div></div><hr />

Something simple would do...right at the end when he looks up, the camera should turn towards the alliance/horde airships flying over northrend, or as someone said earlier, the ships landing near the shores. That type of thing. The player should have been mentioned somehow.<br />
<br />
Quite surprised they didnt milk the video for all the DK action they could..</div></div><hr />
