Have you tried Helya on mythic? For 9/10 mythic raiders, this is definitely still not easy mode. It went from &quot;almost impossible&quot; to &quot;hard&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because on Mythic mode having 5 taints each round meant you had a few options: You could 5 heal, but you won't make the damage requirements that way. Or you could (are required to) bring either a warlock who would have to dispel every single round as well or, as most guilds have done it so far, bring shadowpriests for mass dispel.<br />
<br />
It sort of pigeonholed you into bringing shadowpriests because it was mana efficient and easy. I suspect that's what they wanted to get rid of so it could become a healer's job again. Although we'll likely still use shadowpriests anyway, at least it's an option now.</div></div><hr />

Odyn: He no longer spawns 5 adds to deal with, we did 10man Heroic Alt run due to not having to raid, we only had 3, which made it a joke. Helya, adds has like 3 million HP and the water bloobs has 2 mil each. We also only had 2 debuffs from what I remember.</div></div><hr />

At least for us on Sunday this happened only on Normal, and only on p1 at that. All other times it was full 5 adds. This was with a 10-man raid.</div></div><hr />

There is 5 debuffs on mythic. tainted explosion is the dmg from dispelling the taint.</div></div><hr />

We had 3 debuffs on Helya this week with 10 people. They definitely need to fix that, it sucks bringing a third healer just for a dispel. We have no Locks and a Spriest whom can't make all the raids (works away from home occasionally). We're not struggling with much else other than the fact this is forcing us to essentially bring more people in off-specs than we would want, and it sucks for them too since we do that or we don't raid.</div></div><hr />

Because the rewards were out of sync with the level of challenge it presented. Even with the limited amount of time it takes to complete the available raids, I'm hard pressed to find a reason to do ToV N/H rather than EN on the next higher level of difficulty. Or keystones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Big design flaw then once again. It's pretty hilarious how the hardest content gets nerfed fast for the sake of nowadays half decent raiders can clear content.<br />
This game is infested with handholding addons, and on top of that it receives nerfs whenever not more than 50 guilds killed something... I get it they want to prevent burnout and sub loss, that's why the raids and patches are flying out like crazy atm. Hardcore raiding outside the top 10-15 is DEAD.</div></div><hr />

Because clearly people can't do it and we have a new raid coming very soon. No point having a raid harder than Nighthold out that gives zero useful upgrades.<br />
<br />
Personally I'd have been fine without the nerfs but they can't keep the debuff numbers the same at low player raids. Sick of running more healers than we actually need just for a dispel.</div></div><hr />

There is. It's called do a lower difficulty, or if your so casual, LFR was specifically made for those players. Blizzard don't need to punish players who like harder difficulty because of casuals when they have their own mode made for them.</div></div><hr />

Remove mythic raids, remove rated pvp, and let the gear snob tryhards screw off and never come back. Game will be just fine. There's lots more semi-casuals, casuals, and turbo casuals than all the top guilds combined.</div></div><hr />

So basically remove off what has driven the game since Day 1? You don't have to do mythic or rated pvp. It's not meant for you obviously. Hell I don't even know do it anymore yet I think it's one of the most important things in the game. And the game won't be just fine if they did that FYI. Who do you think keeps subbed all year long? It aint casuals like me who come and go as we please. It's those so called &quot;hardcore&quot;. They never cancel. Most people who don't raid or do serious pvp do cancel and quite often. Blizzard has said this before. When you feel like you have no connection you don't log in. And doing challenging stuff with guildies and friends creates said connections. <br />
<br />
Seriously your comment is so off base it's crazy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
there are more dumb ppl than smart ppl .... so should we favor them?<br />
<br />
'if every single hardcore player quit, so what &quot; you will have a semi minecraft game filled with retards<br />
<br />
isn't it better to MAKE those ppl to actually use their brain and get gewd, even those so called casuals will step up their game or atleast gonna try , if the requirements of doing rewarding stuff is *LOW* so many will stick to that * LOW*and never are going to step up their game.... they're getting shiny loot even with wrong rotation,wrong position,etc... so why should they even bother to adept? instead of lowering the game quality and make it dull isn't it better to add depth and make it challenging? ppl who are beyond retardness will drawn. other will survive</div></div><hr />

<br />
also almost 600 guilds are on 2/3. and about many thosands on heroic full clears<br />
<br />
<br />
so blizzard introducses 4 fucking difficulties in the game but content gets still nerfed?<br />
<br />
whatever man thats just sad<br />
<br />
God, you are so wrong... . 50 guilds is like 0.001% of the player base, and 0.00001% of the actual raiders. So, you cant say,,ppl can clearly do it,,. The level of commitment for mythic raiding is sky high. You do know that there are players out there capable of doing hard content, without ,eat, sleep, raid,, routine. Why should they be denied this, just because the content is so overtuned?<br />
Blizzard understands that they cant do content for 0.00001% of the paying players. Even mythic should be more accesible for non or semi hardcore guilds. <br />
Hope my thoughts make sense.</div></div><hr />

Being 7/7 IMO doesnt say much without knowing your rank, over 2500 giuilds are 7/7, and I can easily tell you, half wouldn't even be that if gear didnt carry them to 885*, vs 860-ish when it came out. Or the few next weeks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Noobs and casuals have LFR and Normal mode, there is literally a person without arms that can clear this level of content.<br />
<br />
If you're not pushing heroic mode its because you just dont care about higher difficulty or dont have the time.<br />
<br />
Stop asking for shit that you dont need.<br />
<br />
Casuals have the base barebones game just like every other game in history.<br />

<br />
The difference of time investment / skill requiremnts of a 3-4 day mythic guild (a healthy normal playstyle) vs a 7 day hardcore progress guild is huge, so huge that if you design a challenging encounter for them - it becomes practically unkillable for anyone else.<br />
<br />
Now blizzard has 3 options<br />
<br />
1) Bring out mythic for 50-150 guilds that can down mythic hellya (thats 700-800 people of 5 million seeing that content. Which is not going to happen, its a waste of recources ), while heroic isnt challenging enough for most guilds.<br />
<br />
2) Make mythic baseline much easier, and you will have 500 guilds killing her on the first day. This kills the entire race.<br />
<br />
3) Or a mix of the two, Make it incredibly hard - but plan nerfs a few months in.<br />
<br />
Seems reasonable no?</div></div><hr />

Rolf I know damn well that they splitrun, I'm not a retard, but it STILL DOESN'T explain fuck all. If you killed Xavius yesterday, as in rank 2600something I wont look up at 8AM. I won't even tell you Gz, you killed it with an avg Ilvl of 885+ nothing impressive at all. Heck we finished EN 2 months ago in 10 days. With an avg Ilvl of 875.5. <br />
<br />
That's a whole 10 Ilvl, you know how much that means? You can 5 heal every single fight in the tier including Cenarius if you're really bad at this game. So my post actually means something. Did I type 860, yes but that's a mistake that has now been cleared. Killing an end boss with the same Ilvl that it drops isn't impressive. That also means being 7/7, doesn't mean fuck all without knowing the ranking, as the skill level is SO LOW in those guilds.<br />

Because top guilds matter in this context, since his context is talking about Mythic as a whole. Where over 2500 guilds has cleared it, and FYI half of these doesn't even Mythic spam, or grind AP. So they don't have 895, they are mostly all at 885'ish with this many weeks of caches and killing farm. In the top end, ofc they grind, but thats out of this context.</div></div><hr />

Class stacking / exploiting / grinding 24/7 is also not really impressive.<br />

Good thing no one really class stacked EN and there was no exploits, was farming a factor yes, BUT AGAIN in this context of the post you quote they are IRRELEVANT. It doesn't change my original point of half of these guilds wouldn't even be able to clear EN Mythic if gear wasn't such a joke to get. That you're 885 by the time you get to Cenarius/Xavius. This also explains why people hit these ''brick walls'' thats called Odyn. IMO other than his bugs, hes not even hard.<br />
<br />
But they'll be stuck since they clearly arent meant to be doing end game mythics while it's still somewhat hard. They'll need nerfs which is fucking sad. Mythic is supposed to be hard. The only time I'll say Mythic is overtuned, is if the mechanic is just flat out impossible to do. Like lets say Odyns blast still 1 shots you from full HP or takes you down to 5%. Then yes I'll agree it needs a nerf.</div></div><hr />

EN seemed to be quite disappointing for top guilds. I'm still unsure wether this was due to the titanforge mechanic or not.<br />
Would've liked to progress in ToV without the nerfs but it'll still be quite a challenge (Helya).<br />
We've only killed Odyn M last night so guess we're one of the hundred scrub guilds :P.<br />
Nerfs are always tossed in when several dozen of top guilds kill stuff.<br />
<br />
Considering the Titanforge mechanic, ilvl/gear won't be a problem at all, it'll just be bashing your head into the boss as much as you can and pray for RNGesus for lucky streaks.</div></div><hr />

Titanforge is a problem, getting BIS loot from dungeons and getting BIS 885 gear from a mythic 7 isn't rewarding at all, it's just plain stupid. I shouldn't spamgrind mythics to get 890 to do ToV.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not even sure what to say to this...<br />
<br />
Well you can start by admitting it's the truth. I really don't hope you think the 2600 something 7/7 guilds spam mythics for AP and 895 gear. Because they dont, and they sure as fuck doesn't have 895, and more towards 885 at this point. But because I'm nice, I'll now take a guild that killed Xavius in the last 3 days and give you their log for avg Ilvl to prove my point.<br />
<br />
http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/eu/ravencrest/Solar+Flare THEY KILLED Xavius 1 day ago, and here is their log, avg Ilvl of 883, AND THERE MY POINT GOT PROVEN.<br />
<br />
https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/XxTQwVcBp9zgnNr1 Notice avg Ilvl of 883. Yea, don't talk out your ass ^^</div></div><hr />

thats like saying you can hit 895 with worldquests. Theoretically yes, but practically no, not even close.<br />
<br />
Raids and one mythic +12 a week is by far the best way to get gear. Ive run over 600 mythic +, and raid mythic up to Ilgynoth once a week. Most of my gear comes from the raid or the bonus weekly chest<br />

Please tell me you're joking just to piss me off, because you're doing that rather well making a clown out of yourself. I can with 100% confidence tell you LFR raiders has 0 to say about nerfs. If you HONESTLY THINK, an LFR raider as something to say about things needing a nerf, then I'm sorry, but you're out of your own mind. They don't balance mythic around LFR raiders who cant break 200k DPS if i gave them a 880 toon with level 54 weapon. Just stop yourself.<br />
<br />
Even worse, Mythic nerfs, like I'm sorry to break it to you, but you're perhaps just not good enough to do Mythic ToV. Did I find Odyn boring as f? Yes I sure did, but I'd say it's perfectly tuned. Guarm is a retard check can people look at their debuffs. We've wiped 0 times on guarm to DPS being bad at doing DPS, or healers doing good HPS. It's always been X player is retarded and can't run to their mark.</div></div><hr />

Did it ever occur to you that ToV was released far too early for the majority progressing on EN at that time? That with the Nighthold being released mid January no one is going to give two fucks about Odyn? It's ok for the super hardcore because they are able to farm copious amounts out of raid hours for their legendaries/extra gear etc, for the rest of us on progress there is literally no respite, constant progress since EN opened, through ToV and will continue with the NH. How does anyone seriously think that these raiders have the time to farm or do anything else when they are spending the majority of their game time raiding? They don't and these players are quitting in droves.<br />
<br />
An encounter should not be 10-13mins avg of add killing, I don't care what you say. The fact that you basically admitted that Odyn is boring, before saying it's perfectly tuned means you literally don't have a clue. I guarantee that if every raider had the time to put aside as much as the top 100, we'd be needing a top 1000.</div></div><hr />

Good thing you don't do Mythic then, because you're clearly clueless. First a fight can be boring and tuned correctly, I found several fights over the years boring, but did they have the correct tuning? Yes the sure had, great job fam. <br />
<br />
Examples of MY PERSONAL OPINION OF BORING BOSSES BUT STILL GOOD FIGHTS AS A WHOLE<br />
Examples since you're 100% going to want them due to you being wrong in the argument. I find Ursoc to he boring. Why? It's a fucking tank and spank, we 3 shotted it on progression when it was still ''hard'' we didn't need vantus rune. We actually laughed at how easy it was. Nythendra, sure as hell isn't fun. You stand still, you get rot, stand still unless melee run out last sec. If ranged, stand still and move after it explodes. <br />
<br />
Killrog, swap to adds zerg boss, nothing interesting still tuned correctly. Tyrant, same as killrog just it actually has Edict which can kill you.<br />
As you can hopefully agree or anyone can if they EVER DID MYTHIC HFC, these fights weren't undertuned easy, nor where they too hard, they punished you for fucking up. But I still found them boring.<br />
<br />
Was HoV released to early?<br />
No it wasn't, blizzard even said IT'S A FILLER RAID UNTIL NIGHTHOLD, meaning it's meant as content for people who has cleared EN *cough* Mythic guilds 7/7 *cough* So it was fine, had EN not been a joke of a raid, then yes I'd say HoV was fine. But when you have 2800 guilds (just checked) who has done Xavius Mythic, I think its about time. We also have over 12000 guilds with Nythendra down, many of these 1/7 guilds PUGGED PEOPLE but wowprogress still tracks as 10 are from the guild. I'd like to think after 3 months if blizzard has raids lined up for the entire Xpack so we dont get a new SoO/HFC; then NH is comming out at the correct timing. 3 months is more than enough to clear the content you wanted.<br />
<br />
Why does Odyn suck?<br />
Phase 1 is redundant on Mythic, phase 1 was meant to show you the mechanics that'll come into play in phase 2 so that you dont get overwhelmed. We know the mechanics, we don't need phase one. In total I think we've had 3 wipes on P1 over our 120 pulls in total. Why did we wipe? We used several hours and came to the end of the raid where players get sloppy.<br />
<br />
Is HoV overtuned?<br />
No, it's punishing just as it should be, I'm sorry you're a baddie, but you can fix that on your own.</div></div><hr />

No it wasn't, blizzard even said IT'S A FILLER RAID UNTIL NIGHTHOLD, meaning it's meant as content for people who has cleared EN *cough* Mythic guilds 7/7 *cough* So it was fine, had EN not been a joke of a raid, then yes I'd say HoV was fine. But when you have 2800 guilds (just checked) who has done Xavius Mythic, I think its about time. We also have over 12000 guilds with Nythendra down, many of these 1/7 guilds PUGGED PEOPLE but wowprogress still tracks as 10 are from the guild. I'd like to think after 3 months if blizzard has raids lined up for the entire Xpack so we dont get a new SoO/HFC; then NH is comming out at the correct timing. 3 months is more than enough to clear the content you wanted.<br />
<br />
Why does Odyn suck?<br />
Phase 1 is redundant on Mythic, phase 1 was meant to show you the mechanics that'll come into play in phase 2 so that you dont get overwhelmed. We know the mechanics, we don't need phase one. In total I think we've had 3 wipes on P1 over our 120 pulls in total. Why did we wipe? We used several hours and came to the end of the raid where players get sloppy.<br />
<br />
Is HoV overtuned?<br />
No, it's punishing just as it should be, I'm sorry you're a baddie, but you can fix that on your own.<br />
<br />
Wow never seen someone so worked up over a game before. Is this guy complaining that casuals can do what he does now? He ain't even cleared mythic ToV and goes on like he is a devine gaming entity lol</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately there are many many people like the one you quoted in WoW.. They think that are the be all and end all because they can do this mode of raiding and they think they know everything and they expect everyone else to kiss their feet because of it.. But in reality they are more than likely some basement dweller no lifer who never goes outside..</div></div><hr />

Rofl, My guild and I clear Mythic, I'm not complaning over people are clearing the content I did while it was still somewhat relevant. What I'm mad over is people demanding nerfs because a boss is hard. I raid mythic for the challenge. Mythic raiding and roleplaying is the only reason I'm even playing this game. I don't do PvP, I dont hunt achieves or mounts or whatever you want. I play for those 2 things.<br />
<br />
I get mad when I see a HC raider thats just not good enough to do mythic, or heck some LFR/Normal raider, demanding that Mythic gets nerfed. It's meant to be hard, not be easy.</div></div><hr />

I fail to see your point? What I can sure is still valid, what does me being 2/3 Mythic in top 400'ish progressing Helya have to do? Please tell me, you're just being a troll at this point. I did the entire mythic EN and did and still raid Mythic ToV just not over xmas break. We WILL progress Helya after newyears and such even if we know we won kill her before NH. Why? I said I enjoy the challenge and everyone in the guild does.<br />
<br />
Also saying I'm a troll, all my points are pretty much true if you look into them. But if you wan't to call me a retard, PM me and I'll send you my Btag shit my personal info if you think you need to personally attack me.</div></div><hr />

Read my previous point. You rant and rave like you are the god of gaming, when you ain't even cleared ToV. There is a challenge, and there is you not able to do it. If you are as good as you think you are would you not have cleared it by now? Come on, like 50 guilds have done it already, why don't you? You have already quoted me on this. Read it again please, as I do hate repeating myself.<br />

I never called you a retard either lol? It's funny how you see your opinion as fact as well lol<br />

Well you sure as all make it sound like you wan't to, saying I'm a loud mouthed person, when I havent even cleared mythic. Yea sure seems like you'd like to hence sure ask for my details so no one has to see you do it. But no shit, the content is HARD, ITS SUPPOSED TO BE HARD. I like it being HARD, its MYTHIC, it's not meant to be easy, it's meant to be HARD. I give out crititism, and correct people where they are either wrong, as saying EN is too hard (lol) Too easy (agree), or is just flat out broken. I respond to what IMO makes a fight a boring fight (Odyn) but is still correctly tuned (just please remove phase 1 fight is else as it should be). I've never said I was the god of gaming, I'm in a roughly rank 400 guild, I'm more than happy with the guild, but I don't wish the raid to be nerfed because rank 2600 guild finds Odyn to be too hard.<br />

No I'm not, I'm pointing out flaws in your comments if I did in the past, else to others, I'm giving in one post my own view on the few fights, and giving some raw facts. Like the number of guilds being done with EN, how HoV is a filler raid, and how it's correctly tuned, to be punishing just as it should be. Also learn to interact with people. Well, sorry if you feel offended by what I say. But as I see it, all my points are as close to facts/down to earth as they can be. Without spewing out DONT NERF YOU CAN KILL IT 1 GUY DID, or THIS IS TOO HARD, PLZ NERF IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ODYN HITS BACK.</div></div><hr />

Raids and one mythic +12 a week is by far the best way to get gear. Ive run over 600 mythic +, and raid mythic up to Ilgynoth once a week. Most of my gear comes from the raid or the bonus weekly chest<br />

Your opinion matters equally as much as someone farming LFR . Having invested your life into Wow make your opinion on TOV nerfs more valid. This change either was / wasnt directed at you, but &quot;normal&quot; people are definitely happy with it.<br />

First a fight can be boring and tuned correctly, I found several fights over the years boring, but did they have the correct tuning? Yes the sure had, great job fam.<br />
<br />
Well I raid mythic actually, I've already been progressing on Odyn for wipe after wipe now, you're missing the point many people will scorn you for which is raiding is supposed to be &quot;fun&quot;. If an encounter is laboriously designed in such a fashion that it's only difficultly lies with repeating the same mechanics over and over again for over double the amount of time of any other boss, just to see if you can endure it's shit for 10mins, you are absolutely wrong in stating that it is tuned correctly, hence why blizzard are nerfing it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Examples of MY PERSONAL OPINION OF BORING BOSSES BUT STILL GOOD FIGHTS AS A WHOLE<br />
Examples since you're 100% going to want them due to you being wrong in the argument. I find Ursoc to he boring. Why? It's a fucking tank and spank, we 3 shotted it on progression when it was still ''hard'' we didn't need vantus rune. We actually laughed at how easy it was. Nythendra, sure as hell isn't fun. You stand still, you get rot, stand still unless melee run out last sec. If ranged, stand still and move after it explodes.<br />
<br />
Yes I agree these fights are also boring, but they last a 1/3 of the time it takes to kill Odyn.<br />
<br />
<br />
Killrog, swap to adds zerg boss, nothing interesting still tuned correctly. Tyrant, same as killrog just it actually has Edict which can kill you.<br />
As you can hopefully agree or anyone can if they EVER DID MYTHIC HFC, these fights weren't undertuned easy, nor where they too hard, they punished you for fucking up. But I still found them boring.<br />
<br />
Yes you found them boring, and both fights you just described again we're fast paced regardless of them being &quot;easy&quot;, you deal with mechanics, the boss dies in a reasonable amount of time, correctly tuned.<br />
<br />
<br />
Was HoV released to early?<br />
No it wasn't, blizzard even said IT'S A FILLER RAID UNTIL NIGHTHOLD, meaning it's meant as content for people who has cleared EN *cough* Mythic guilds 7/7 *cough* So it was fine, had EN not been a joke of a raid, then yes I'd say HoV was fine.

<br />
Right so by your logic, this raid was only for the hardcore guilds who cleared EN mythic week one and had a nice easy farm time before it was released? I just can't fathom why you cannot understand statistics, if 2800 guilds have cleared EN mythic and a small fraction of that have killed Odyn, what does that tell you? That everyone &gt;100 are &quot;baddies&quot;?<br />
<br />
<br />
Why does Odyn suck?<br />
Phase 1 is redundant on Mythic, phase 1 was meant to show you the mechanics that'll come into play in phase 2 so that you dont get overwhelmed. We know the mechanics, we don't need phase one. In total I think we've had 3 wipes on P1 over our 120 pulls in total. Why did we wipe? We used several hours and came to the end of the raid where players get sloppy.<br />
<br />
So you're saying an encounter doesn't need a whole phase, yet complain that the boss was totally tuned correctly... astounding. Ah but you finally get it, people getting sloppy, well people will get sloppy when they're doing the same phases over and over for 10mins before even trying to handle phase 3.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Is HoV overtuned?<br />
No, it's punishing just as it should be, I'm sorry you're a baddie, but you can fix that on your own.<br />
<br />

<br />
So by your logic which I find more idiotic. A fight cannot be correctly tuned, yet be boring? Odyn IS ONLY BORING because of phase 1, add all their HP to phase 2 and it's fine. Also again, as I've said to other too, just saying you're progging on Odyn doesn't say much. If you're a rank 2800 guild, I damn well hope you struggle with a hard boss. You only got 7/7 because you got carried by 885 gear in EN (which I also proved new 7/7 Guild did) Over a span of 4 weeks, 580 Guilds are 2/3 and 860 are 1/3.<br />
<br />
Thats damn well good numbers, just around 1/3 of the guilds having gotten the first boss. Because you have to remember out of those 2800 atleast a few hundred got Xavius during ToV being out MEANING THEY HAD LESS PROGRESS TIME. Each and every boss is tuned rather well, other than Helya needing 2/3 Sp's and perhaps her huge HP pool.<br />
<br />
Also there is nothing wrong with being a baddie, if I make it out to be that. But the truth is, baddies will also get stuck on a hard boss. During HFC when my guilded raided 1 day a week, I raided in 2 other guilds for the remainding 6 days. Both guilds got stuck on the harder bosses like gorefiend for a good 2 weeks, and got stuck on mannoroth for a good month. And honestly, NONE OF THEM complainined about it. They knew fights like Xhul and Tyrant got carried by gear, and knew they are baddies. But they didn't want a nerf, people enjoy the challenge, thats why you do Mythic. Nerfing mythic because baddies can't do them is just dumb.<br />
<br />
And a final thing ToV is meant as a filler tier, as in, this is extremely hard content. I never saw anything crying over Archimonde taking 3 resets to kill. Yes you read that correctly, It took Method the guild that got Helya in 3 days. over 3 resets worth of gear to down him. Archi didn't see many nerfs other than before he died.<br />
<br />
<br />
Final note, because this is too stupid to bother, people wont learn that Mythic is meant to be hard.<br />
<br />
Tyrant took more than 10 pulls to kill. She for pretty much everyone took a good 70+ wipes, which sure isn't fast when the avg from the people I know from rank 150-1800. Used roughly the same on Odyn or are closing in on that number and getting to P3 consistently.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It does, Carnedge. It's always been like this, too. I think back to our most hardcore days during Vanilla when we raided 4-5 nights a week, plus additional ZG and AQ 20 raids during weekend late nights. I don't even remember, really. It was constant. Fun, but constant. I had the time and flexibility back then, and that's how I was able to do it. We all did back then. We were &quot;in the race&quot; for whatever it was worth.<br />
<br />
More free time translates into more progression of your character (and everything else), and that translates into kills and faster kills for those concerned about &quot;the race.&quot; I'm not saying skill doesn't matter. It does. Big time. Skill doesn't mean anything, though, if you can't get past other big hurdles, and this is something only guild masters, recruiters, and other guild/raid administrators fully understand. There are TONS of great players out there who have no idea how hard mythic raiding actually is since their only job is to be at the raid, prepared, buffed, and cranking out damage.<br />
<br />
Free time AND flexibility are indeed the most important variable, followed by reliability and attendance to reach the required 20 (which also is about free time and flexibility). Leadership must constantly engage in administrative efforts to make sure you have 20 solid people each night. Absences WILL happen, and people WILL disappear without notice, sometimes to never reappear. Ever. After that comes the sustainability level of your raiders, meaning all of them have to be fine with lots of wipes, slow progression, little to no raid loot, playing with more strangers and being open to that, tolerating personalities, etc. This sustainability ideally lasts the entire expansion. Most often it doesn't. Your raiders need to ENJOY this process. Trying to figure out who your loyal reliables are takes a lot of time. Once you have these &quot;basic&quot; things in line, then you start looking at skill (throughput, staying alive, timing), preparedness, strategy, communication, etc. This is the &quot;easy&quot; stuff that often solves itself if you have dedicated people. They often go hand-in-hand. We could also talk about morale, synergy, attitude, mood, etc. Lots of guilds collapse due to toxic, cynical, elitist people. Sustainability is a rare trait among guilds, especially raiding ones. They might last one or two expansions, but then they implode, break up, etc. This is because they have no actual foundation besides the raid itself. Lacking relationships. Another discussion there.<br />
<br />
If you can't find a consistent, dedicated group of 20 people, even with some backups who are willing to play bench, you can't begin progression. Blizzard still doesn't let guilds use group finder to get that last person you might need, and this really hurts efforts, too. This is an easy hurdle for big guilds to cross since they can lean on their previous record and bodies. It's kind of like inheriting wealth. There's nothing wrong with this by the way. However, the advantage is often taken for granted. Ever hear some dude on the forums proclaim, &quot;It's easy to get 20, brah.&quot; Lots of this talk during Warlords after all of the serious 10-man were sacrificed for the new mythic 20 change. You often hear this from raiders who don't play administrative roles. For smaller, newer guilds, this is a gigantic, often impossible challenge to overcome. Tons of guilds get 14-19 people and never get off the ground, even though they have skilled, reliable people. Snagging a mythic Nythendra kill is the first step. Getting her a second time and then farming her is the second step that many have failed to do. The third step is getting Elerethe and Ursoc down. Another big hurdle, along with farming them after. Dragons is the next big step since it requires further precision from all 20. The list goes on.<br />
<br />
Our biggest challenge is trying to get the same 20 people each week. I don't think it's happened yet - there is always one, two, or three &quot;shuffles&quot; to the raid team each week. It's happened with tanks and healers, too. That being said, we've been able to get 4/7M on a two-night per week raid schedule due to dedication, loyalty, raid experience, preparedness, leadership, recruitment, and finally raiding skill. If you can get 99-100% attendance from your 20 you will progress MUCH faster and things will become MUCH easier.<br />
<br />
It would be interesting to see how rankings would change on each server if all guilds raided on the exact same raid nights for an equal amount of time. &quot;The race&quot; doesn't mean much since we can't properly compare apples to apples. Guilds that raid earlier in the week will get kills faster and higher rankings, even if they're sloppier, take more attempts, and are not as good as other guilds. If these &quot;early-week&quot; guilds also raid 3-5 nights a week, such as with a Tues/Wed/Thurs schedule, their rankings will naturally be even higher, giving them the appearance of &quot;being better.&quot; It's all about time and schedule. Guilds that raid three nights per week need to be ranked against other guilds that raid three nights per week, etc. Take it a step further and only rank them against other three-night guilds that also raid on the exact same three nights. That would give us a more valid picture of what's actually happening out there. The most progressive raiding guilds - the smallest minorities - deviate even further, and that's why they don't really matter when it comes to broader discussions, such as this current TOV nerf.<br />

Quite easy. Pretty much all guilds having the skill to kill Helya allready killed her. <br />
<br />
Blizzard has 2 options after that, seeing the low numbers of kills.<br />
Either they do nothing and tryharding guilds may kill her once they overgear it even more than they allready do. Which is the stupid option.<br />
Or they nerf an overtuned raid to fit the dificulty with the rewards so non top tier guilds can finally kill her without loosing sanity/members/time. Which is obviously the smart option, the one blizzard took.</div></div><hr />

Yes, and? It's still better than nerf it. If people haven't the skill to kill her atm, so let them get better stuff and try it again, and again, and again until they kill her. Making her easier is not a good solution, they just ask players to be brainless to kill.</div></div><hr />

Remove mythic raids, remove rated pvp, and let the gear snob tryhards screw off and never come back. Game will be just fine. There's lots more semi-casuals, casuals, and turbo casuals than all the top guilds combined.<br />

besides whining like little kids for years untill blizzard removed first badge/vp tier and trinekts , then vp gear , then mid expansion dungeons , then whole endgame besides raiding and mythic still couldnt beat 5 % participation even when there was f...all to do in wod ? - ye what did they do what affcted causal 95 % of playerbase indeed.</div></div><hr />

I completely disagree. There are plenty of guilds who have killed Guarm currently who could kill her, given a week or two more attempts. You act like there's guilds not in phase 3 currently. The guilds who will steamroll her tonight or tomorrow could easily have killed her, they just don't have enough attempts yet. Raiding three days a week only gets you so far.<br />

I hardly doubt that 5% of the playerbase was able to change the game to that magnitude. That's delusional.</div></div><hr />

So, you cant say,,ppl can clearly do it,,. The level of commitment for mythic raiding is sky high. You do know that there are players out there capable of doing hard content, without ,eat, sleep, raid,, routine. Why should they be denied this, just because the content is so overtuned?<br />
Blizzard understands that they cant do content for 0.00001% of the paying players. Even mythic should be more accesible for non or semi hardcore guilds. <br />
Hope my thoughts make sense.<br />
<br />
then go lfr so no it doesnt make sense, read my post correctly<br />

also stop making shit with 00000000 prercentage<br />

A few guilds in the world sure, a 1-2 hundreds people. Bad luck. But you'll always have people who could &quot;have just killed her before nerf, promise we are good&quot;. From BC to Legion, nothing new. Fact is blizzard took action early to impact the less people possible and helping the most at the same time : christmas pause is just arround the corner and nighthold just after.

Even if NH is just as hard, it's got far better rewards and is a better use of your time. ToV has overtuned fights and crap loot so guilds are only doing it right now because there's nothing better to do.</div></div><hr />

Yea sure seems like you'd like to hence sure ask for my details so no one has to see you do it. But no shit, the content is HARD, ITS SUPPOSED TO BE HARD. I like it being HARD, its MYTHIC, it's not meant to be easy, it's meant to be HARD. I give out crititism, and correct people where they are either wrong, as saying EN is too hard (lol) Too easy (agree), or is just flat out broken. I respond to what IMO makes a fight a boring fight (Odyn) but is still correctly tuned (just please remove phase 1 fight is else as it should be). I've never said I was the god of gaming, I'm in a roughly rank 400 guild, I'm more than happy with the guild, but I don't wish the raid to be nerfed because rank 2600 guild finds Odyn to be too hard.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
No I'm not, I'm pointing out flaws in your comments if I did in the past, else to others, I'm giving in one post my own view on the few fights, and giving some raw facts. Like the number of guilds being done with EN, how HoV is a filler raid, and how it's correctly tuned, to be punishing just as it should be. Also learn to interact with people. Well, sorry if you feel offended by what I say. But as I see it, all my points are as close to facts/down to earth as they can be. Without spewing out DONT NERF YOU CAN KILL IT 1 GUY DID, or THIS IS TOO HARD, PLZ NERF IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ODYN HITS BACK.<br />
<br />
Lol the god of gaming here talking all of this smack, yet it took them 2 weeks to take down Guarm after taking down Odyn.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but nerfs were a good idea - nighthold comes out in less than a month and will make TOV completely irrelavent. best to make the content slightly more accessible to the audience its meant for, and more in scale with the gear that it drops, b/c it certainly is not worth the effort reward wise.</div></div><hr />

I'm just saying, out of the 400 or so guilds who had Guarm dead, I would assume atleast 50 of them had phase 3 progress on Helya. That's not to say they would have got it, but to be that far is pretty damn good.</div></div><hr />

You have to do literally nothing in the game to not gain power right now. So if you dont do a single thing... why would you suddenly wnt to do raids ? i don't get this type of behaviour. With Trait 35 all PvE content gets a 5% nerf. But you want more... you get up to 10% nerf with trait 45.</div></div><hr />

I can with 100% confidence tell you LFR raiders has 0 to say about nerfs. If you HONESTLY THINK, an LFR raider as something to say about things needing a nerf, then I'm sorry, but you're out of your own mind. They don't balance mythic around LFR raiders who cant break 200k DPS if i gave them a 880 toon with level 54 weapon. Just stop yourself.<br />
<br />
Even worse, Mythic nerfs, like I'm sorry to break it to you, but you're perhaps just not good enough to do Mythic ToV. Did I find Odyn boring as f? Yes I sure did, but I'd say it's perfectly tuned. Guarm is a retard check can people look at their debuffs. We've wiped 0 times on guarm to DPS being bad at doing DPS, or healers doing good HPS. It's always been X player is retarded and can't run to their mark.<br />
<br />
Youre not getting the point. The guy doing LFR or lower end mythic bosses pays 12$ a month, so do you. The guy doing Normal has an equal right to be challenged by Raidcontent as you do. I can only laugh at people beeing offended by Mythic nerfs. Blizzard gave you an extremely fair tuning system - if youre extremely good at the game - you get to clear Mythic in its hardest form at release. If youre not so good - but heroic is too easy - you get to be challenged by a nerfed - yet still hard mythic system.<br />
<br />
The whole whining seems to be because more people are getting mythic items and challenging your heritage as the chosen raider. Please get over yourself.</div></div><hr />
