Players with an active subscription or game time on their World of Warcraft account will be able to create up to three characters per WoW account and have the name(s) reserved before WoW Classic releases worldwide on Monday, August 26 at 3:00 p.m. PDT.<br />
<br />
We will release details regarding realm names and realm types later this week so you can coordinate with your friends on where to begin your adventure. If there are high numbers of players congregating on individual realms during the name reservation/character creation process, we will post warnings about the potential for long queues on those realms, giving you time to choose alternate realms. Also please note: Character creation will be limited to only one faction per realm on PvP realms.<br />
<br />
After release, the number of WoW Classic character that can be created per WoW game account will change to the following limits:<br />
<br />
<br />
A maximum of 10 characters per WoW Classic realm.<br />
A maximum of 50 characters across all WoW Classic realms in your region.<br />
Only one faction per realm on PvP realms.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is no overlap regarding character limits with World of Warcraft, so if you have 50 characters in Battle for Azeroth you can create 50 more characters in WoW Classic.<br />
<br />
WoW Classic’s worldwide release is almost here so it’s time to get started organizing and planning your path to level 60!<br />

Artifact skins unlock question<br />
In Legion I played Horde and I unlocked the mage tower appearance. Recently I leveled a Human Warrior and I want to unlock the 3 other colors for the mage tower appearance. Can that be done on my new warrior or do I have to unlock them on my Horde character?<br />
As Cedrad said here, this does need to be done on the character who has the original unlock, in this case that would be your Horde Warrior. Once they have completed the requirements to unlock the other colors though those would be available to use for Transmog by other Warriors on the account (spec restrictions still apply) (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1107245-artifact-skins-unlock-question/) / Official Forums (https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/66874/7))</div></div><hr />

Should help reduce the number of people in login queue on launch day, too — it takes care of a bunch of people who would’ve otherwise only signed in on launch day to reserve character names with no intention to play until a few days later.</div></div><hr />

You mean on servers that no one knows are going to be used, or turn into the next disgusting cesspool like Moonguard 2.0?<br />
<br />
And no, it's not better. It's just as bad, if not worse. Because now people will be reserving names on servers they're probably not even going to end up on. And of course no one's going to delete them, because what incentive is there to do so?</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure Blizzard will come out in a few months and say we will be wiping pre-launch name reservations on such and such a date.</div></div><hr />

Would you rather someone just logs in faster than you, saves 10 names, then sells them?<br />
<br />
This way, you can actually have a relatively decent chance. No need to whine about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. When classic goes live do you really wanna waste a ton of time trying to figure out what name is open/ what appearance you want for your character? Do you really wanna spend 10 minutes trying to come up with names while your friends are waiting?<br />
<br />
2. Having people create names ahead of time means less &quot;name selling&quot;<br />
<br />
3. Having some people create ahead of time will make a filter on when it goes live a lot of people will go in right away, while some will be busy making characters.<br />
<br />
4. Creating ahead of time makes planning servers with friends easier. <br />
<br />
5. People cresting characters ahead of time helps blizz figure out what servers will likely have the most players and the biggest day 1 load.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your logic is truly atrocious. Let's look at it logically:<br />
<br />
A) If they didn't do this, you'd log in on launch day and try to spam reserve the names you want on the servers of your choice. If, as you argue, the server turns into a cesspool, then tough shit, you're in the exact same bad situation you're accusing the early reservations of potentially having, meaning this is no longer a con for early reservation. It's a neutral point.<br />
<br />
B) They do it the way this blue post proposes. We find out the realms THIS week (AKA before the 12th, which is NEXT week), we therefore know the realms in advance of reserving our names, and we fight over reserving our names exactly like we would on launch had they not done it this way, again making your criticism invalid by simply being neutral.<br />
i) By doing it this way, an added benefit is that, as the blue post says, if it's revealed before launch that the realms you reserved names for are grossly imbalanced, they'll give you the ability to move that character for free prior to launch.<br />
<br />
How you can spin this news as a negative thing truly boggles my fucking mind. Some people will complain about anything, won't they? With this proposed method we get the same risks of reserving names at launch, EXCEPT people can only reserve 3, not as many as they want, AND the servers aren't bombed by people logging in, AND you'll get a FREE chance to move realm BEFORE launch if you ended up picking a bummer of a realm. <br />
So I ask again, how the fuck is this a bad thing? Why are you even complaining?</div></div><hr />

Nothing but it can be nice to reserve a name especially if it's meaningful or popular<br />

Layering is there to prevent there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's stated in this very post that they will be revealed later this week.<br />
<br />
<br />
Couldn't we do this at like 6pm PT?<br />
<br />
They chose this specific time in order to line it with the start of August 13th in CEST timezone. It's exactly midnight for most of the Europe. That's their new thing with global releases that always line up with midnight in CEST.<br />
<br />
<br />
Waiting for them to open WAY too many servers and then having half of them be dead 1-2 months later<br />
<br />
That's why they have layering. So one server can virtually serve as multiple servres for about a month, maybe 2. That way they have much lower risk of opening way too many servers.</div></div><hr />

Luckily vast majority of popular streamers are NA, so only have to avoid forsen and one's set. Though he will in all probability roll on a PVP-realm and I'll go PVE, so even simpler.</div></div><hr />
