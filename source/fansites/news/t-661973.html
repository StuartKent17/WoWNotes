<br />
Other sites started it, I'll try to finish it. Think twice before you read this post, we have a lot of spoilers here.<br />
<br />
Most of this stuff will be announced at the Blizzcon anyway, if you didn't take the time to order the live stream you might want to consider doing it. We will probably see a lot of interesting things here. <br />
This year, for the first time, you'll have the opportunity to enjoy a live Internet stream of BlizzCon coverage from the comfort of your own home. The stream includes the same content as the DIRECTV pay-per-view event, but you do not have to be a DIRECTV subscriber to purchase it. It consists of over 16 hours of video, including interviews and commentary, main stage presentations, and tournament coverage. It’s now available to order for $39.95, and purchasers will also receive the BlizzCon 2009-exclusive in-game pet, Grunty the Murloc Marine (not available in all regions). Head over to the BlizzCon 2009 Live Stream website to get more information, to test video playback on your system, or to place an order.<br />

<br />
Forums - The WoW Cataclysm General Discussions forum (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?board=38.0) is now available. <br />
<br />
Update - Another update from the Something Awful forums has been confirmed and is now integrated to the post. (The original quote was removed by the author's request on SA)<br />
<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft: Cataclysm<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft: Cataclysm is the next expansion for World of Warcraft. Dark and forgotten threats that have long stayed out of sight have finally arrived on our shores, unleashing a cataclysmic event upon Azeroth and now preparing more nefarius plans to take it back.<br />
<br />
Level Cap<br />
The level cap in the next expansion will be slightly lower than expected this time around; 85.<br />
<br />
This suggests Blizzard wants more room for expansions before hitting the level 100 cap. With less leveling to do (along with the revamped leveling listed below likely to increase the speed and ease of leveling), leveling a new race remains appealing for new and existing players alike.<br />
<br />
Leveling from 80-85 should be a much bigger deal, the idea is to make sure that gaining a level really means something and doesn't make you feel like you just have 4 more levels to go. <br />
<br />
New Classes<br />
Cataclysm doesn't introduce any new classes to the game. Instead, Blizzard have offered more race and classes combinations to players. The Some of these have alreadly been datamined from the 3.2.2 Test Realms. The An Injured Colleague (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/13986/an-injured-colleague/) quest and it's new Night Elf counter-part help to introduce the lore for these new race and class combinations, so we can probably expect to see more of these for some of the less traditional ones.<br />
<br />
Human Hunter (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/36575/human-hunter/)<br />
Orc Mage (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/36576/orc-mage/)<br />
Night Elf Mage (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/36579/night-elf-mage/)<br />
Dwarf Mage (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/36580/dwarf-mage/)<br />
Blood Elf Warrior (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/36583/blood-elf-warrior/)<br />
Dwarf Shaman (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/36584/dwarf-shaman/)<br />
Undead Hunter (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/36586/undead-hunter/)<br />
Tauren Paladin (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/36587/tauren-paladin/)<br />
Tauren Priest (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/36588/tauren-priest/)<br />
Gnome Priest (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/36589/gnome-priest/)<br />
Troll Druid (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/36590/troll-druid/)<br />
<br />
<br />
New Races<br />
The events of the cataclysm has caused two new races to seek new allies. The Goblins for the Horde and the Worgen for the Alliance.<br />
<br />
Goblins<br />
Deathwing once again sought the services of the goblins, as slaves. Unable to refuse such an offer, the goblins were enslaved by him. A large group have resisted however. With their previous homes devastated by the cataclysm, they escaping to an island off the coast of The Barrens. As they strive to recover, they come across an Orc captured on an Alliance ship and rescue him. The Orc turns out to be none other than Thrall himself, and in return offers the Goblins a place within the Horde. These events are carried out in a quest line, allowing players to experience first-hand the reasons behind the Goblins' shift from neutrality.<br />
<br />
Worgen<br />
The cataclysm has cracked open the Greymane Wall, finally revealing what has happened to the kingdom of Gilneas and its citizens. With the Worgen curse taken hold, they have found a partial cure, allowing thme to retain their Human minds even when transformed. Venturing forth from Gilneas and seeking help from the Alliance, they have decided to join them, to combat the new threats of Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Gilneas will make extensive use of the phasing system (much like the Death Knight starting area), to show what happened while the kingdom was cut off from the rest of the world and lead up to present day.<br />
<br />
Worgens will have two forms, a Worgen form and a Human form. Players will be able to customise the look of both forms.<br />
<br />
New Content<br />
Cataclysm will be the first expansion not to introduce a new continent, instead making use of previously unreleased zones and revamping existing ones.<br />
<br />
Classic Azeroth Revamp<br />
A cataclysmic event caused by Deathwing and Azshara will change the face of Azeroth as we know it. Most of the new content for Cataclysm will take the form of a revamped Azeroth, taking advantage of newer additions to WoW such as phasing and daily quests. Most of the quests and mobs in the classic zones will also be redesigned to make leveling less painful. With the revamp, a greater narritive and sense progression will be offered to players. Some zones and dungeons will change drastically to fit this, e.g.,<br />
<br />
The Barrens will be split into two separate zones of two different level bands.<br />
Azshara will become a low level (~10-20) zone.<br />
Some of the zones like the Thousand Needles will be flooded.<br />
Durotar is wrecked and apparently Orgrimmar could be destroyed. A new Orc city is rebuilt over the course of the expansion.<br />
Gnomeregan will be part of the expansion as well and gnomes might be able to reclaim their capital. (The last part is still unconfirmed)<br />
Wailing Caverns will be become a lush tropical area as a result of the druid's magic.<br />
The Blackrock Spire will erupt and a new version of Blackrock Mountains will be available, apparently Ragnaros will be back too.<br />
<br />
In the aftermath of the cataclysm, and the new conflicts on the horizon relief efforts can be found in many zones and new open PvP areas similar to Lake Wintergrasp.<br />
<br />
Flying in Azeroth<br />
Part of the redesign of the Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor is the introduction of flying to the two continents, allowing access to many new areas and quicker travelling across the large continents.<br />
<br />
Classic Dungeon Revamp<br />
Redesigning Onyxia's Lair in Patch 3.2.2 was just the first step. As most of the leveling will take place in revamped areas of Azeroth, so too will the dungeons, allowing players to use them to level from 80 to 85.<br />
<br />
Unreleased Zones &amp; Dungeons<br />
With the addition of flying mounts to Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms and the redesign of many zones, most of the previously unreachable or incomplete zones will now be made available to players. This is where most of the new content from 80 to 85 will take place. Some of these are,<br />
<br />
Hyjal (present)<br />
Gilneas - The Worgen starting Zone.<br />
Uldum<br />
<br />
It is unclear if the old Goblin locations such as Kezan and Undermine will be included in Cataclyms with the revelation of the goblins' plight, but several new islands have also been risen from the seas by the events of Cataclysm, some on the backs of giant sea turtles and whales, with the addition of several underwater zones.<br />
<br />
Characters and Events<br />
<br />
[b]Deathwing<br />
Deathwing the Destroyer / Neltharion the Earth-Warder (http://www.wowwiki.com/Deathwing) will play a major role in Cataclysm. Having been driven mad by Old God whisperings and turning against his own kind only to be fail in his attempts, Deathwing has sunk into the shadows. While the Horde and the Alliance were busy fighting back the Burning Legion only to then be beset with the Scourge, he has been lurking and moving things into place. After Lady Sinestra's failed attempts to create a Twilight Dragonflight (http://www.wowwiki.com/Twilight_dragonflight), he again retreated to Grim Batol and succeeded where she failed. With his results seen in the Obsidian Sanctum, he has finally created the supreme Dragonflight he sought and plans to unleash it upon the world. But what of the Old Gods' sway over him?<br />
<br />
Azshara<br />
Queen Azshara (http://www.wowwiki.com/Queen_Azshara) will also play a major part in Cataclysm. Unknown to many mortal races, long forgotten by others, and believe to be dead by her own kind, she has not been dormant in depths of the Maelstrom. Having those around her transformed by the Old Gods into Naga after her failure in the War of the Ancients, she has become far more powerful and a greater threat than she once was. Not content with just Nazjatar and the depths of the sea, Azshara seeks to reclaim power and reign once again. With the true plan behind Lady Vashj's support of Illidan remaining a mystery we do not know what hand Azshara has yet played. The big question remains, is she now serving her &quot;saviors&quot;, the Old Gods?<br />
<br />
The Cataclysm<br />
I'm still not sure who is the true end boss of Cataclysm is, but the cataclysm appears to have been caused by attempts to incantation to summon extremely powerful beings using an ancient incantation by Deathwing and Azshara. They're both very powerful, but the cataclysm itself suggests something more powerful is behind it, perhaps their shared past of Old God influence?<br />
<br />
The Guardian of Tirisfal<br />
Malfurion Stormrage will be returning to Azeroth to aid in the creation of the new Guardian of Tirisfal - Thrall! Med'an's (http://www.wowwiki.com/Med'an) role in these events is currently unknown.<br />
<br />
The New (New) Horde<br />
Thrall will hand over the leadership of the Horde to Garrosh Hellscream, while he serves as a coordinator for both the Horde and Alliance forces in and effort to combat the new threat of the Naga and Black Dragonflight. Without Thrall to keep Garrosh in check, he declares open war on the Alliance. In the political upheaval Cairne Bloodhoof is implicated as a traitor to the Horde and murdered by Garrosh. Cairne's son Baine takes over as the new Tauren chieftan. This could explain why Baine was removed from the game in Patch 3.2.2, you can find more information about this in Ahmo Thunderhorn - replacement for Baine Bloodhoof?

Although I don't think they would go through all the trouble in revamping Azeroth, its a very good Idea. I do hope they do the race combination though!<br />

<br />
Human Hunter - Nathanos Marris, the first (and only so far) human Ranger.<br />
Night Elf Mage - This is the easiest one, the Highborne are back, as we know from 3.2.2. We could also bring Illidan, a non-Highborne Night Elf mage.<br />
Blood Elf Warrior - They always existed, as Blizz said when they decided to replace them by the hunters.<br />
Dwarf Shaman - Wildhammer Clan dwarves.<br />
Undead Hunter - Nathanos &quot;Marris&quot; Blightcaller. Just got to EPL and say hello to his pets from me, OK? And, oh, Sylvanas Windrunner. I guess after the betrayal of the RAS, she could probably want to be closer to home.<br />
Tauren Paladin and Priest - The &quot;Sun Druids&quot; talking that appeared on 3.2. If Elune is the source of both Night Elf Druids AND Priests, why not the Tauren with An'shee and the &quot;Light&quot; of the Sun?<br />
<br />
The other 3 race/class combo I leave you for speculation. Your guess is good as mine.</div></div><hr />

BREAKING.<br />

<br />
<br />
I don't like the new class thing though, just seems (very) pointless, and sort of destroys the uniqueness of the races.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If any of this is true, I hope they wont revamp the old world. That would suck big-time. Imagine never being able to return to the old world. It'll all be totaly fucked up. <br />
<br />
No way this can be true.</div></div><hr />

I don't really see why they would give us more race/class combos, to be honest. Although much of the other is very possible, and might very well come true. I guess we'll see in a week or two ;)</div></div><hr />

Only ONE new druid race? That automatically makes me think either: Worgen will be druids, and Goblins won't, or this is all just fake info added to make players get excited. They go out of their way to make class balance (One new paladin, one new shaman for horde/alliance, respectively), then give horde another druid, but not alliance?<br />
<br />
This really does just sound like an April Fools joke, tbh. An april fools joke in August, :P (I'm aware this was datamined from the PTR, but who says blizz doesnt put them there as a joke?&quot;</div></div><hr />

Troll Druid LOL I just can't see it, but I guess we needed another druid race in the Horde.<br />

Blood Elf Warrior lol c'mon Blizzard, you know we used to make fun of them because they are so femenime they are the only class that can't be warriors, you ruined it!! no more pussy BE jokes =(<br />

in the other hand:<br />

Redesigning Onyxia's Lair in Patch 3.2.2 was just the first step. As most of the leveling will take place in revamped areas of Azeroth, so too will the dungeons, allowing players to use them to level from 80 to 85.<br />
<br />
As far as I know, Ragnaros will also be back in this expansion. <br />
<br />
<br />
everything sounded pretty great until i got to this part.<br />
<br />
going back to the old zones is fine, especially if they are revamped and taking advantage of the phasing tech. to be honest that actually sounds like it could lead to some cool stuff with a good mix of new fun and sweet nostalgia.<br />
<br />
but repeating the dungeons too? and the raids???<br />

It is all pretty awesome. What you need to realize is that there is a very vocal (and thankfully very small) minority of the WoW fanbase who are made up of bitter malcontented basement dwellers who will whine and bitch and moan at every single decision Blizzard take with their hugely successful MMO. Sadly most of these types tend to dwell on fansites such as this and the official forums, unleashing their amazing insight such as &quot;OMG EPIC FAIL WTF BLIZZ&quot; and &quot;CASUALS RUINING THE GAME WTF BLIZZ&quot; to the surprise of no-one. Of course they continue to pay their monthly fees and play a game they can't stand for no apparent reason other than masochism.</div></div><hr />

Most of those new race/class combinations make absolutely no sense. Worgen as a playable race makes no sense. Goblins are supposed to be a neutral race.<br />
<br />
Flying mounts in azeroth is terrible news for world PvP'ers. Azeroth was the only fun place left to world PvP. In northrend and outland everyone just hops on their flying mounts and runs away. <br />

<br />
But, people are getting bored of WoW because there's nothing much to do once you've reached the levelcap. Yes, you have raids and you succesfully kill the bosses in said raids, but after that, you have to wait another month or 2-3 to get the next raid to go through. An expansion should -expand- the world, -expand- the content and -expand- the re-playability. How is revamping the old world going to expand on anything? All it does is giving us a little push to level yet another alt to see the &quot;new&quot; content.<br />
<br />
Now, of course they could revamp the old world and give us the same amount of actual new content WotLK or TBC had, because then it would be a dream of an expansion, but I sure as hell hope this is the case, because having a revamped old world with 2-3 level 80+ zones would be incredible boring and not worth the money, in my humble opinion.</div></div><hr />

Actually, it is a design one, the ones that work on terrain and buildings are designers. Just create a sandbox server with your WoW and see how unfinished and full of &quot;light&quot; tricks old Azeroth is.<br />

You misunderstand. Let me put it this way: the guy who designed the art and architecture for, say, Ulduar is not the same guy who got in and coded the polygons.<br />

The guy who coded the polygons is working on retexturing azeroth, which requires minimal input from the art department. The art department is off working on a new game.<br />

Most of the new race/class combos make no sense. Sure you can find a few NPC's of each race that are the exception, but as playable characters they don't seem ... right.<br />

However, I have to say that Undead Paladins would be a 180 degrees on the current lore. Paladins were the only humans immune to the Scourge plague.</div></div><hr />

<br />
also you mentioned that they will remove barrens as a low level zone and split it in 2 high level zones then i realized that not so long ago they added a zeppeling between Thunderbluff and Ogrimmar so if that be the case it will allow fast travel without having to run thru the high level zone.<br />
the only thing that i don't like about all of this is that it will feel kinda weird you running around kalimdor for example level 80-85 barrens and right besides it Mulgore full of low level mobs. assuming they don't use phasing to hide the low level areas in barrens.</div></div><hr />

Just keep in mind that it takes a LOT to make me post something on the front page and I'm definitely not speculating here. <br />
<br />
Except the fact that you just said none of it has been officially confirmed yet, which means this is all speculation. You didn't really provide sources for any of your information at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft: Cataclysm is the next expansion for World of Warcraft. Dark and forgotten threats that have long stayed out of sight have finally arrived on our shores, unleashing a cataclysmic event upon Azeroth and now preparing more nefarius plans to take it back.<br />
<br />
<br />
Speculation that it's the next expansion.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
New Classes<br />
The expansion doesn't have any new class. Instead, Blizzard will offer more race and classes combinations to players, some of them have been datamined on the 3.2.2 Test Realms.<br />
<br />
Human Hunter (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/36575/human-hunter/)<br />
Orc Mage (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/36576/orc-mage/)<br />
Night Elf Mage (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/36579/night-elf-mage/)<br />
Dwarf Mage (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/36580/dwarf-mage/)<br />
Blood Elf Warrior (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/36583/blood-elf-warrior/)<br />
Dwarf Shaman (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/36584/dwarf-shaman/)<br />
Undead Hunter (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/36586/undead-hunter/)<br />
Tauren Paladin (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/36587/tauren-paladin/)<br />
Tauren Priest (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/36588/tauren-priest/)<br />
Gnome Priest (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/36589/gnome-priest/)<br />
Troll Druid (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/36590/troll-druid/)<br />
<br />
<br />
That sounds quite interesting, but still where's the source? You don't really show us much here. <br />
<br />
How would you know which class and race combinations Blizzard are going to put in their next expansion?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Level Cap<br />
The level cap in the next expansion will be slightly lower than expected this time around; 85.<br />
<br />
This suggests Blizzard wants more room for expansions before hitting the level 100 cap. With less leveling to do (along with the revamped leveling listed below likely to increase the speed and ease of leveling), leveling a new race remains appealing for new and existing players alike.<br />
<br />
<br />
The second part makes sense, but still no source. Complete speculation as far as I can see.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
New Races<br />
The events of the cataclysm has caused two new races to seek new allies. The Goblins for the Horde and the Worgen for the Alliance.<br />
<br />
Goblins<br />
The Goblins have found themselves washed upon an island off the coast of The Barrens, their islands devastated by the cataclysm. As they strive to recover, they come across an Orc captured on an Alliance ship and rescue him. The Orc turns out to be none other than Thrall himself, and in return offers the Goblins a place within the Horde. These events are carried out in a quest line, allowing players to experience first-hand the reasons behind the Goblins' shift from neutrality.<br />
<br />
It is unclear if the old Goblin locations such as Kezan and Undermine will be included in Cataclysm with the revelation of the Goblins' displacement.<br />
<br />
Worgen<br />
The cataclysm has cracked open the Greymane Wall, finally revealing what has happened to the kingdom of Gilneas and its citizens. The Worgen have ventured forth from Gilneas and sought help from the Alliance, deciding to join them to combat the new threats of Cataclysm. <br />
<br />
<br />
Considering the Cataclysm happened over 10000 years ago, they took their time looking for new allies. Worgen weren't on Azeroth 10000 years ago and I'm not sure but Goblins might not have been around either.<br />
<br />
It's complete illogical speculation that they could be the new races. If you even bothered to read up on the lore behind both races you would understand that at the current point in time it makes no sense for either Goblins or Worgen to pick a side.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gilneas will make extensive use of the phasing system (much like the Death Knight starting area), to show what happened while the kingdom was cut off from the rest of the world and lead up to present day.<br />
<br />
Last but not least, Worgens will have two forms and will be able to morph between a human form and a worgen one. Players should be able to pick both appearances when they create their character.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Speculation. Although if Gilneas where to be released, it probably would be home to tones of Worgen.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
New Content<br />
Cataclysm will be the first expansion not to introduce a new continent, instead making use of previously unreleased zones and revamping existing ones.<br />
<br />
Classic Azeroth Revamp<br />
A cataclysmic event caused by Deathwing and Azshara will change the face of Azeroth as we know it. Most of the new content for Cataclysm will take the form of a revamped Azeroth, taking advantage of newer additions to WoW such as phasing and daily quests. Most of the quests and mobs in the classic zones will also be redesigned to make leveling less painful. Some zones will change drastically to fit this, e.g.,<br />
<br />
The Barrens will be split into two separate zones of two different level bands.<br />
Azshara will become a low level (~10-20) zone.<br />
<br />
Flying in Azeroth<br />
Part of the redesign of the Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor is the introduction of flying to the two continents, allowing access to many new areas and quicker travelling across the large continents.<br />
<br />
Unreleased Zones &amp; Dungeons<br />
With the addition of flying mounts to Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms and the redesign of many zones, most of the previously unreachable or incomplete zones will now be made available to players. This is where most of the new content from 80 to 85 will take place. Some of these are,<br />
<br />
Hyjal (present)<br />
Gilneas - The Worgen starting Zone.<br />
Uldum (Most likely as a dungeon)<br />
<br />
Classic Dungeon Revamp<br />
Redesigning Onyxia's Lair in Patch 3.2.2 was just the first step. As most of the leveling will take place in revamped areas of Azeroth, so too will the dungeons, allowing players to use them to level from 80 to 85.<br />
<br />
As far as I know, Ragnaros will also be back in this expansion. <br />
<br />
Deathwing<br />
Deathwing the Destroyer / Neltharion the Earth-Warder (http://www.wowwiki.com/Deathwing) will play a major role in Cataclysm. Having been driven mad by Old God whisperings and turning against his own kind only to be fail in his attempts, Deathwing has sunk into the shadows. While the Horde and the Alliance were busy fighting back the Burning Legion only to then be beset with the Scourge, he has been lurking and moving things into place. After Lady Sinestra's failed attempts to create a Twilight Dragonflight (http://www.wowwiki.com/Twilight_dragonflight), he again retreated to Grim Batol and succeeded where she failed. With his results seen in the Obsidian Sanctum, he has finally created the supreme Dragonflight he sought and plans to unleash it upon the world. But what of the Old Gods' sway over him?<br />
<br />
Azshara<br />
Queen Azshara (http://www.wowwiki.com/Queen_Azshara) will also play a major part in Cataclysm. Unknown to many mortal races, long forgotten by others, and believe to be dead by her own kind, she has not been dormant in depths of the Maelstrom. Having those around her transformed by the Old Gods into Naga after her failure in the War of the Ancients, she has become far more powerful and a greater threat than she once was. Not content with just Nazjatar and the depths of the sea, Azshara seeks to reclaim power and reign once again. With the true plan behind Lady Vashj's support of Illidan remaining a mystery we do not know what hand Azshara has yet played. The big question remains, is she now serving her &quot;saviors&quot;, the Old Gods?<br />
<br />
The Cataclysm<br />
I'm still not sure who is the true end boss of Cataclysm is, but the cataclysm appears to have been caused by attempts to incantation to summon extremely powerful beings using an ancient incantation by Deathwing and Azshara. They're both very powerful, but the cataclysm itself suggests something more powerful is behind it, perhaps their shared past of Old God influence?<br />
<br />
<br />
Speculation. Where's the proof? It just seems like you guessed some stuff from what Blizzard has been doing and what people have found then jumbled in some extra words and called it news. I do appreciate the effort you put into writing stuff up for the front page as I learn a lot about upcoming patches from them but just stop with the silly speculation. You don't work for Blizzard so how would you know anything that's going to happen? You don't so this is just speculation, like I've said too many times already.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's complete illogical speculation that they could be the new races. If you even bothered to read up on the lore behind both races you would understand that at the current point in time it makes no sense for either Goblins or Worgen to pick a side.<br />
<br />
Speculation. Although if Gilneas where to be released, it probably would be home to tones of Worgen.<br />
<br />
Speculation. Where's the proof? It just seems like you guessed some stuff from what Blizzard has been doing and what people have found then jumbled in some extra words and called it news. I do appreciate the effort you put into writing stuff up for the front page as I learn a lot about upcoming patches from them but just stop with the silly speculation. You don't work for Blizzard so how would you know anything that's going to happen? You don't so this is just speculation, like I've said too many times already.<br />
<br />
<br />
For the new race combos, I believe MMO discovered them while datamining the new patch 3.2.2 ptr</div></div><hr />

<br />
so many posts about how the game is easymode and how great vanilla was blah blah blah<br />
<br />
they're trying to bring back the feel of vanilla by hopefully basing a lot of the game in the old world and people moan about not creating new content. amazing.<br />
<br />
I imagine any new expansion will feature a fuck load of new content. revamping the old world alone is gonna take a shit load of work on top of anything else. new races and race combos + a revamped selection of levelling zones will be great for those of us who have done the old world and outlands 5+ times. even if the old raids are revamped they're going to change dramatically from the ones we used to do at 60 due to all the new mechanics and ways of thinking.<br />
<br />
I for one cannot wait to fly my epic flyer around the old world. will finally make the 5k seem worth it.<br />
<br />
also it got me thinking that maybe they're planning to release this expansion relatively quickly, maybe in time for christmas, and have the 85-90 one out relatively (12 months?) quickly after. if you think about how quick the content patches for 3.x have been coming lately it might make sense.<br />
<br />
my only complaint is a lot of this could and should have been done in a major content patch. fixing the old world for flyers and sorting out some of the old zones, azshara for example.</div></div><hr />

Disappointment is a big word. I would love to see all of this content in the game at some point, but it shouldn't be the biggest chunk of content in an expansion. As I said before, the main goal of an expansion is to expand, with some slight hints of revamp. The main goal of patches is to revamp, with some hints of expanding.<br />
<br />
However, while I do like the sound of this newspost (even if it sounds farfetched and unsourced), the story behind the Goblins is just too retarded (unless this version is a very simplified version). A greedy race with a sole purpose of making money, without any loyalties and a strong neutrality (to make more money), won't just sell their soul (or give up their greedy practices) to the Horde just because they did something nice for some random Orc that appeared to be Thrall.</div></div><hr />

Shame if it's only 5 level increase.<br />
<br />
Would the new races start at level 55 or 1? As it said they would have a history of what happened and how they came to their factions, would fit in with the quests along the way you can get the items like totems in that area.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reusing old content is fine, as long as they give us new content. Opening up some zones that were previously unused are a good start, but I don't want to have to run the same dungeons that I've done a bunch of times before. I would love to run h sfk, but I want some new instances too.<br />
<br />
Assuming all this news turns out to be true, it seems like WoW will be finished after this expansion. They've brought us full circle. I don't think I would want anything after returning home. I hope at the end of the expansion, after the final Raid boss has been defeated, there's an epic server-wide quest chain that sets in motion the destruction of the world.</div></div><hr />

I wanna sail the seas, set sail to the tomb of sargeras, do some shaggy deals in undermine, getting chased by pirates, be one, meeting the trade princess, meeting king rastaban, discovering the true isle of the zanzalar trolls, i even wanna fall into mountain kezan...<br />
<br />
not bloody revamping of dungeons, not only a lvl raise with 5...and even ragnaros is coming back, mc was (i know, its getting way old) just a setback i gues...<br />
<br />
I dont want any of those new classes, except maybe worgen &amp; troll druid, belf warr and human hunter...ud hunter is just plain ridicule...im allrdy seeing the jokes from the future ud hunters on my servers 'yeah, i know i should have come out of that void spot, and thats why we wipped, but my wolf just ran off with my leg and trigger finger, i blame him'.<br />
<br />
and flying in azeroth ? i heard that wow is build in many layers 'atop' of themselves, so isnt that kinda almost impossible then ? i sunk 1 time through icecrown and i saw many other zones flashing beside me...endless pit ftw, but need to admit, after 20 min i closed wow...<br />
<br />
and if they gonna revamp all the dungeons to higher lvl, what about new char who wanna do a dungeon instead of questing/pvping ? or what bout the old wep in it, like onyxia ? do we keep em or let em also drop, next to usual loot ? or worse...just adjust the stats, remove the whole old helmet from the game and put 1 new word in the name of the helmet...voila, new expansion gear...<br />
<br />
and what bout aq40 gate q line or all those nice old tier sets i still wanna collect ? or quelserrar, vanilla legendaries, semi-legendary priest and hunter weps, etc ?<br />

I work with a guy who used to play wow, and he has 2 friends that work for blizz, one a gm and the other doing something design related.<br />

A few weeks back he was telling me how one of his freinds was trying to get him to play again. He rejected the 25 year (or whatever) friends and family key so the friend then tried to get his interest with some inside information. he told him that the next expansion would see a major revamp to the old world including zones and instances, and also that flying in azeroth will finally be allowed.<br />

now it could of all been a tall story but tbh this guy isnt like that, he's generallly a quiet guy, well educated and hardworking. i cant even remember him ever telling me any stories of wild nights or the like.</div></div><hr />

Flying in old content! Revamped old dungeons! WTB heroic Wailing Caverns!! I think revisiting reimagined old content will be absolutely fun! And I think it will make leveling new characters interesting again!</div></div><hr />

Yeah... there better has to be a lot of other stuff not mentioned yet or i´m not impressed at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not true.......... you know that leveling 80-85 will take much!much! longer than any other level cap because its story base, meaning you have to complete a huge quest line to advance and that is just one great big content and continents..... welll you wont be on contitents but you would be across tons of islands in the great sea.<br />
<br />
And well for talents...... we already have tons, suggesting that the 5 talent points would be really big and by level 85 dude your 75 talent point will prolly make you a super hero<br />
<br />
And adding to that the graphics is presumably much better and game play 1-85 will be sooooo much better</div></div><hr />

Blizzard is giving &quot;all players&quot;* what theys always wanted.<br />
*relative<br />
<br />
- Flying in Azeroth<br />
- The old world is dying out. Just used for auctionhouses.<br />
- Adding new races<br />
- Adding more compination (human hunter was often a request)<br />
- Old epic dungeons, nobody visits anymore.<br />
- most likely/probably graphic update<br />
- Too less story. more queststory lines.<br />
- reroll / twinks making is soooo boring / azeroth questing is boring<br />
<br />
--&gt; revamping old world, making more combinations. and new races (it iwll feel like a new Wow- WoW2 just with more updated style and with things blizz learned in 5 years)<br />
<br />
- phasing will make old zones 3 times more useful and interesting.<br />
- you could level one zone for at least 15-20 level, with possible zone phasing<br />
<br />
Now Blizzard is giving people what they want and they are still QQ ....<br />
<br />
The expansion after could be revamp BC (partly wotlk), adding more zones to all continents so people need to keep in touch with all 3 :D, level 85-90 :D<br />
<br />
Edit: and the final Expansion will blow everything: 4th continent, bigger than bc and wotlk, 90-100 : the end of an era ;)<br />
<br />
Edit2: I wouldnt be suprised if the interface would also get a huge update if all of that is right</div></div><hr />

That one I call BS, since Med'an is clearly being built as the new Guardian. But that doesn't say that Thrall can't join the new Order of Tirisfal. The New Order is not a speculation.<br />
<br />

4. Some of the class combos (UD Hunters Tauren Paladin, Dwarf Shaman)<br />
<br />
Actually, there are already undead hunters (Nathanos Blightcaller and Sylvanas Windrunner) and dwarf shamans (Wildhammer Clan) in game. The Tauren Paladin can be related to the new quest of &quot;Sun Druidism&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will explain the class combos 1 by 1<br />
<br />
Tauren Priest- Makes sense they will use the same stuff trolls use not the light<br />
<br />
Tauren Paladin- Instead of using the light the tauren paladins will be a mix of warriors and shaman/druid<br />
<br />
NE mage- highborne<br />
<br />
Dwarf Shaman-They're really clsoe to the earth and wildhammers had shamans.<br />
<br />
the rest makes sence.</div></div><hr />

Much of this is just speculation and exaggerated from rumours.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be surprised if some of this was true, some of the race/class combos could be probable, but more or less only<br />
Human Hunter, Night Elf Mage and Gnome Priest.<br />
<br />
Why would the level cap just be 85? Any source for this? Why 5 and not 10? It doesn't have any direct effect on how it is at the new max level, wether it's 85 or 90.<br />
<br />
Why would the old world just get fucked up all of a sudden?<br />
<br />
Flying mounts in Azeroth is completely unecessary and would just take a huge load of work just to hear people complain that they're being ganked by flying level 90's on 4500% flying mounts in STV.<br />
Only reason to se Azeroth redesigned for flying mounts would be for a Emerald Dream expansion, which we probably won't see this time.<br />
(For those who do not know, the Emerald Dream presents Azeroth without sentient beings, thus it would be just one large continent, Kalimdor, since the night elves never would be there to fuck everything up and blow it all to pieces.<br />
<br />
And why wouldn't there be a hero class?</div></div><hr />

Hmm, I wonder if the starting quest will be the same... like go kill these boars over hear or instantly get you into the cataclysm story line... like killing naga instead of boars.<br />
<br />
From my understanding. It is like a massive explosion has happened in the maelstorm which possibly sent typhoons and earthquakes all over Azeroth. The world that we know today... is going to be completely different.<br />
<br />
I wonder if they are going to phase Azeroth until you finish your WoTLK questing... to give your character a more linear storyline. It would be strange to level your character in a world filled with Death Wing and Azshara; which has the lich king slain... to then take a portal to Outlands to kill Kael'Thas... not once, but TWICE!</div></div><hr />

Not that you'd need them, you'd already know about them.<br />
<br />
<br />
So you post information on the frontpage which &quot;takes a lot for that to happen&quot; but unable to cite where said information came from?<br />
<br />
It's one thing to cite an anonymous source --- it's done consistently to protect the source itself in sensitive situations, i.e. police sources, cabinet members, political aides, etc. They're typically done in the style of &quot;A source close to Blizzard has released the following information: &quot; with some snippet about Blizzard not having made an official announcement so the source couldn't be named or a reference to the sensitive nature of the information. All of which translates to &quot;Hey, this is going down. I'm not giving out my name b/c I don't want to be fired. Also, if you want more information in the future you'll protect my identity.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's another thing to cite no sources and then say you're incapable of actually citing any source.</div></div><hr />

Trolls can get stv &gt;.&gt;, and for gnomer well they can actually get 2 starting areas because blizz needed to revamp the zone above stormwind so that can turn out to be a huge mountain were the river from sw came from mines and the 1-10 levels could be the mountains above gnomer and the shore beside it making it an airfield and submarine base</div></div><hr />

The Kirin Tor has nothing to do with the Order of Tirisfal. <br />

<br />
Most of those new race/class combinations make absolutely no sense. Worgen as a playable race makes no sense. Goblins are supposed to be a neutral race.<br />
<br />
Flying mounts in azeroth is terrible news for world PvP'ers. Azeroth was the only fun place left to world PvP. In northrend and outland everyone just hops on their flying mounts and runs away. <br />
<br />
I was really hoping Blizz would continue their idea of &quot;hero classes&quot;. I know making an entire new class is difficult but for me its hands down the most exciting part of expansions. <br />
<br />
<br />
See I don't really understand your point of view at all. If anything this is the most monumental change they could make. Instead of simply adding more they are adapting the world to reflect the changes the players have had on it over the past five years. I've seen Ony's head up in Org zillions of times now and it seems more like decoration then part of the game at this point. Making old content relevant again is not only a large task, but makes the game feel a lot more alive then it would from simply adding a new class that throws off game balance. If the changes and updates to Ony are just one step in this direction I think WoW could change for the better.<br />
<br />
I envision a WoW where the world felt small again. With max level characters interacting with lowbies because they were constantly crossing paths aside from running back and forth from the AH to the mailbox. Sure some people might leave cause they find it boring, but that will happen regardless of what the next expansion entails. I think it is going to be fun if they bring back old Azeroth. I just hope they do it justice.</div></div><hr />

I'm a veteran player that has been playing since day one of retail (and before during the betatesting). I really do enjoy WoW a lot more at levelcap than back in the days because there's actually something to at levelcap now (apart from having your HS set to Kargath and do nothing but MC/BWL all week).<br />
<br />
I also like going back to the old zones to level alts. But I really don't want an entire expansion to focus on leveling alts. Yes, all this stuff sounds amazing if true (and I hope it's true), but people that want something to do at max level or don't like leveling alts (I know a lot of people that have one character and a few 10-15 alts that they never got higher (also playing since vanilla)) shouldn't be left out, since this target-group is still the biggest chunk of the WoW playerbase.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
No it's really not. I really wanted Pre-BC servers and reading 80% of this news post make me furious. I want new content to play and explore. I don't want Blizzard digging up the old Instances and Raids and messing with them. Making them 10 and 25 player MC which all the kids will PuG for emblems. I want to play the Classic game at 60, with 40 people the way it was when it was out at that time or not at all. <br />
<br />
An expansion should be new fresh content and not this utter laziness. Yes making Azeroth flight friendly will be a bit of work. Nothing like making a new continent from scratch though. Worgen and Goblins, sounds cool. New classes for races? Utter crap, not interested. The new slow leveling seems cool, making it an achievement to level and not a boring slog thats the same. <br />
<br />
If they actually re-use the old raids, instances, areas then I'll quit after 5 years of playing this great game. Re-using Onyxia in the next patch is bad enough but I guess this is what we get because Blizzard are concentrating on their next source of money instead of their dedicated fanbase on WoW. Trial of the Crusader / Champion was a massive slack for a BT equivalent raid and Onyxia is just stupid. Theres no reason to bring her back. The Pre-BC people don't want to play the old content at 80, we want it back at 60 the way it used to be. <br />
<br />
I know this could be a massive troll, fake info and it's just a game but Seriously, I've never played a game as much as WoW and it's horrible to see stuff like this happen to the game. <br />

<br />
i wouldnt say that<br />
cause if they revamping zones so beatyful you wouldnt recognize anymore is harder to make a new continent.<br />
revamping 30 zones + flying is more work than making 8-10 new ones from the cratch<br />
<br />
+ they add phasing to the old world, at least 5 new zones as it looks like and revamping old epic dungeons<br />
<br />
<br />
so where is there less work?!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LrdPhoenix</div><div class="date">2009-08-15, 01:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to agree with people here. While the idea of revamping the old world sounds nice and all, if the majority of the expansion is just phased old world areas, it will really feel like a cheap cop-out. Unless they plan on adding this in addition to Maelstrom zones and/or making this &quot;expansion&quot; only a 6-9 month cycle till the next &quot;real&quot; expansion after that... will like I said, just sounds like a cheap cop-out.<br />
<br />
<br />
It said it will make use of phasing, but it sounds like a complete revamp and rebuild of the original world, meaning even new characters would wind up playing in the new Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor, and not just high level characters. Would certainly make leveling interesting again. Like a whole new game. <br />
<br />
I was expecting something like this to come along eventually. A good number of MMOs go about revamping old content to be in line with the quality of newer content sometime down the road. Some do it by a major graphics overhaul of old models and textures and stuff, some do it by world redesigns. <br />
<br />
With the quality of world building and quest design and lore and all that that's gone into BC and definitely WotLK, it makes original WoW content look like Warcraft: Orcs and Humans versus WotLK's Warcraft 3, so that's obviously the areas that they would focus on if they were to overhaul the old world.<br />
<br />
I think it's great, if it's true.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yawnteh</div><div class="date">2009-08-15, 01:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically why many people wont believe in this is because Blizzard has never said that it would be upcoming, and that these things would take loads of time. Now therefor when it finally comes people dont like it cause its a part of an expansion that they have to pay. <br />
<br />
People see brand new continents when they hear expansion, along with 10 levels to level and alot of new stuff.. but if you think about it changing the old world into new zones with perhaps new models, new quests and basically new everything (except for the name) would not be that bad. <br />
<br />
They have also stated that it wont be only old stuff but new stuff aswell such as UNDERWATER CITIES . Thisll probably mean an underwater mount and maybe even better.. underwater fights.</div></div><hr />

Emerald Dream will be 86-90.<br />
<br />
Planes set... the Sageras expansion, the end of all ends... 91-100.<br />
<br />
Thrall handing the horde to Garrosh is awesome. Garrosh killing Cairne is more awesome. It means there will be more of an actual PvP aspect to the game. The next expansions PvP is going to be about large scale PvP ladder system. Ladders for WSG, as an example.<br />
<br />
Hopefully they will either create more world PvP zones, then just one. Or, make a better world PvP zone because WG was total fail as a FFA zone.</div></div><hr />

You know, where the information is unusually accurate for being &quot;speculation&quot;.<br />
<br />
No source?<br />
&quot;I cannot cite sources.&quot; tell Blizzard immediately what happened. An employed snitched. The correct way to handle it it say nothing - then Blizzard is as frustrated at it as the nay sayers.<br />
<br />
And this isnt a revamp of the old world; They are talking about splintering the two old contents... this is going to essentially be new content entirely if it is true. Having phasing and such business from the very beginning requires the content to be re-written and produced again. I can assure you that the phasing technology is not something they can simply slap onto existing content and make it work right.<br />

I dont expect this all to be true.<br />
But I didnt expect there to be such high-and-mighty, holier-than-thou-art reaction to the pre-Blizzcon speculation from the community. They said they dont post stuff on the front page without having a great deal of faith in the information - if you cannot believe them on that merit after months (years) of very reliable information then you have personal problems well beyond the scope of this site and a video game that you may be a little too involved in for your own well being.<br />
<br />
Yes - I made an account to post this.<br />
Yes - I will be back to have a REALLY good laugh if this all turns out to be true.<br />

Emerald Dream will be 86-90.<br />
<br />
Planes set... the Sageras expansion, the end of all ends... 91-100.<br />
<br />
Yup. They are gonna sell us two expansions. One for 80-85 &quot;Cataclysm&quot; and one for 85-90 &quot;Emerald Dream/Nightmare&quot;. Just like they did with Starcraft II they are going to be splitting them into multiple pieces of software to generate more MONEY,</div></div><hr />

<br />
wow is now pretty much the same story progress as the mega man series<br />
<br />
mega man = war of the ancient, battle against a constantly growing evil<br />
<br />
mega man X = vanilla, new evil surfaces and old ones come back<br />
<br />
mega man zero = TBC and LK, confronting old evil once and for all catastrophe happens<br />
<br />
Mega man ZX = this if true, post apocalypse with everyone in a war with each other betrayed, etc</div></div><hr />
