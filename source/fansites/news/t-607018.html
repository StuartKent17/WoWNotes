I read it to mean that mage's polymorph spell will still heal. But if you get polymorphed by an NPC, it will no longer heal you, just incapacitate you.</div></div><hr />

That's also how I read it, I wonder if that includes shade of aran. It'd make the fight much harder for entry level raiders.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Basically if you have no/few interrupters or high DPS (outgear the encounter basically), it becomes quite harder - if he reaches evocation the raid is most likely dead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Indeed this thing is so fecked up as it is that I don't know how worse can it get.<br />
Stop feckin with us Blizz.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zwai</div><div class="date">2008-04-23, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">- Like the Void Shatter change.<br />
- Like the Brilliant Glas change.<br />
- Still undecided about the new match making system, since it might give lower rated teams an even harder time. I mean you already face up to 50% S3s pushing ratings as it is.<br />
- Like the Arena point calculation change though.<br />
<br />
Improved Blink change sounds good, but who, except for a few uber skilled Mage+Rogue teams, would spec Arcane/Fire in the first place when doing PvP. It's a nice duelling or zerging spec but in Arena with equally skilled and equipped opponents it takes &quot;glass cannon&quot; to a whole new level.<br />
<br />
I also like the tradeskill CD change. Now if a raid until 11pm I still can transmute at 8pm the next day and don't have to wait 2 hours longer. Kudos for that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quick Dawnstone, Reckless Noble Topaz, Forceful Talasite are now all available at the Quel’danas gem vendor.&quot;<br />
I take it those are the rare spell haste gems. Do they mean the recipes? Anyone on PTR got some infos how much they will cost? I do hope they don't go the &quot;50g per recipe&quot; route like for the epic cut patterns.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mazorp</div><div class="date">2008-04-23, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's them saying the LPS should have never been so expensive in the first place. This actually makes the &quot;best&quot; enchants the most expensive as well. It'll lower the cost a bit also on a number of enchants (+spell damage to bracers for one, which is stupidly expensive for what it is). I don't make money off enchanting, never expected to. I got it for the extra 24 spell damage.<br />
<br />
I find it extremely stupid how Blizzard will remove the heal on Polymorph for NPCs but not for Mages. It's like them admitting it doesn't need to be there but they'll never fix it for Mages...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
We also wanted to give everyone a heads up to some changes that will be in an upcoming patch, altering how points are gained and players are matched in the arena system. The patch with these changes is scheduled to release before the start of Season 4.<br />
<br />
The implication of the last sentence is that there is still enough time before Season 4 starts to get a patch through the PTR and into Live. They also said they would give us at least 2 weeks notice of the start of S4. So, given that 2.4.2 is hitting the PTR this week, I think we do still have 3-4 weeks before S4.</div></div><hr />

I for one am happy for this change. The AH alliance side on our server is god awful. LPS go for 30g, and Voids go for 30g. At least this will make voids hopefully 60+.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The change only affects Boars. Growl will still scale with Hunter attack power like all other pet spells, it just won't scale with boosts to the pet's attack power.</div></div><hr />

I think you're missing the point. You can't &quot;fk up&quot; something when you're doing it on purpose… They're making the change specifically to lower the price of LPS. A &quot;fk up&quot; would typically be an unintended side effect, which this is not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's always been worse for Warlocks with our &quot;tanking demon&quot; (Voidwalker), the main difference being that yours sort of scaled, and you had feign death.<br />
Quite frankly if Blizzard did this to equal the score on this subject, they should'v instead made Warlock minions scale (or hell, fix pet scaling as a whole, hit, crit, resilience).</div></div><hr />

But other weapons are unchanged, like Talon of Azshara is still unique and Claw of Molten Fury is still Main-Hand Unique.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fist Weapons will always stay Main-Hand or Off-Hand just because of the fact that Blizz is too dumb to make them fit either way.<br />
Also, Caster and Healerweapons will always stay Main-Hand because they don't want Shamies running around dualwielding Lightfathom Scepter or something ;)<br />
<br />
Like the change of the smithing weapons, but it comes 6 months too late.... wondered the whole time why they didnt change it before, cause they changed the Kara Main-Hand weapons, like decapitator, a long time ago :-(<br />
<br />
and finally i don't have to pay ridiculous prices for LPS in the AH anymore :)</div></div><hr />

They WILL NOT start season 4 while the Arena Tournament is still ongoing..... i really don't know how many times this has to be said before it sinks in.</div></div><hr />

It is documented ..... Manrito said something a few posts back about it and it is also on the front page of MMO Champion.<br />
<br />
Blacksmithing BOP Weapons Dual-wieldable in 2.4.2<br />
Blacksmiths are probably going to be happy, all their BOP Weapons have been changed and aren't unique anymore ! That's a nice change alone, but if you took the time to read the 2.4.2 Patch Notes you probably remember seeing something mentioning Main Hand weapons changed to One-Hand .... Well that's the case here, you can now dual-wield them !<br />
