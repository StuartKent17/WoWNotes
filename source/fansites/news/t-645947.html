The Noblegarden is now live on european servers and will be available in the US in a few hours. Before you read the &quot;guide&quot; you have to keep in mind that this event is very simple. <br />
<br />
1. Brightly Colored Eggs are hidden in the starting town of each races: Bloodhoof Village, Brill, Falcowing Square, and Razor Hill for the Horde. Azure Watch, Goldshire, Dolanaar, and Kharanos for the Alliance. The eggs are only in this town and will respawn in a few seconds/minutes, it probably won't be enough during the first days of the event because a LOT of players will be camping them. They're hidden in different spots of the town and might be a little hard to find at first, but it becomes very easy when you know what you're looking for. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/april/noblegarden_egg1_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/april/noblegarden_egg1.jpg) http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/april/noblegarden_egg2_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/april/noblegarden_egg2.jpg) http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/april/noblegarden_egg3_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/april/noblegarden_egg3.jpg)<br />
<br />
2. Looting the eggs will give you a <br />
http://static.wowhead.com/images/icons/tiny/achievement_noblegarden_chocolate_egg.gifNoblegarden Chocolate (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=44791) or one of the rare item from the event, you can also buy all of them with the chocolates if you're lucky enough with your eggs. Please note that <br />
Dressed for the Occasion (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?achievement=249) and Sunday's Finest (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?achievement=248) will not work if you buy the items from the NPC, you have to find the items in an egg to complete the achievement. (These 2 achievements are NOT part of the Noble Gardener (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?achievement=2797) meta-achievement.<br />
<br />
3. When you've got enough chocolate to buy all the items you need for the achievements, the only thing left to do is to complete the achievements that require you to travel in other zones/continents : <br />
Desert Rose (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?achievement=2436), <br />
Spring Fling (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?achievement=2419) / Spring Fling (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?achievement=2497) and <br />
Noble Garden (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?achievement=2420) / Noble Garden (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?achievement=2421). <br />
<br />
The Noblegarden Vendors (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/april/noblegarden_vendor.jpg) will let you buy the items you want if you can't find them in eggs.<br />

<br />
This is wrong. When an egg gets picked up, a new one spawns. Which, for once, means that the more players picking up eggs, the easier they are to find!</div></div><hr />

2 rabbits (yes, despite having learned the rabbit pet earlier, you can still get the item from the eggs)<br />
2 elegant dresses<br />
2 tuxedo shirts <br />
1 tuxedo pant<br />
2 spring robes<br />

<br />
The first 15 minutes we had to ourselfs, then a mage from my guild showed up and we we're just the 3 of us for maybe an additional 15 minutes, then people started coming, ending up with about 15 egghunters.<br />
<br />
was funny to do a /who Elwynn and imagining all the 40 people showing up we're in goldshire hunting for eggs.<br />
<br />
My girlfriend got her title at 03.11 and I got mine half an hour later, due to having bad luck finding the female taurens and orcs. Rare breed I might add..<br />
<br />
Found my female dwarf by doing a /who dwarf and cross checking the sex on armory ..<br />
<br />
All in all quite fun and we're both happy we got it done.</div></div><hr />

Yes, you have to find it yourself in an egg.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Was farming eggs at 2am though.<br />
I was lucky enough to get the pet rabbit from an egg, saving me 100 chocolates, of course when i got the second rabbit drop my sister was not impressed :D<br />
<br />
I had a spot in Kharanos where i could cover 6 eggs at once, moving no more than 5 yards to loot.<br />
<br />
Finding an Orc Female was a pain, but i managed to nab one during wintergrasp, the worst part of this by far was the 5 minute cooldown on the Spring Flower.<br />
<br />
Nothing worse than seeing a &quot;rare&quot; female, and being unable to bunny it because i wasted my CD on a nelf</div></div><hr />

Don't sell yourself short! Once every five minutes is quite respectable for anyone over level 30, and downright impressive at level 80. ;)</div></div><hr />

yeah pretty much did 75 eggs in the first 30 minutes then it took me 2 hours to get the other 75 &gt;_&lt;</div></div><hr />

Female toon with bunny ears and Black Mageweave Pants, chest and boots. Rar.</div></div><hr />

Best spot for me was Falconwing Square. Camping at fountain and under the bench, was the only one doing that most of the time.</div></div><hr />

I still have 70 of them in bank and no idea what am I supposed to do with them...<br />

<br />
You shoulda bought hundreds of these:<br />
<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/?item=21537<br />
<br />
That's what I did on both my 80's, stored like 500 in their banks. It's amazing for food, much better than the shitty 15k HP default/mage food. And I don't have to spend money on food every few days. :D<br />
<br />
Also, they stack with water, so you can regen a mana bar in like.... 10 seconds.</div></div><hr />

The Noblegarden event just didn't feel like it was enough, or there should have been a giant bunny mount included that you could buy for like 500 chocolates or something..</div></div><hr />

At least 50 kids running around collecting eggs like crazy flies that would KILL to get these eggs.<br />
Apparantly i &quot;stole&quot; 1 egg from a guy, from his &quot;farming place&quot;, and he yelled at me :P<br />
<br />
Evil event.<br />
<br />
<br />
OMG! LOL I had that issue this morning. People running around like chickens with their head cut off, looking for these eggs. I get to one and start looting before another person, and they scream at the top of the ingame lungs LOL!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Someone bit me for taking an egg.<br />
<br />
But still, spent 4 hours on the event, went to sleep for 6 hours, logged on, completed the last achievement seconds later, and I was the first in my guild to get the title.<br />
<br />
I thought it was just right! Normally, I can't be bothered with events like this, but Noblegarden was pretty good. I love how Blizzard didn't take it to Northrend/Outland, because that's not too fair on lower level characters, or those without the expansions.</div></div><hr />
