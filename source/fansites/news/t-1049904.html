Stars Spine of Deathwing 25 DPS<br />
Stars recently shared their DPS meter from the Spine of Deathwing fight, which you can see below. Unlike the KIN Raiders meter, it does not show just the tendons. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
RIFT / Trion Worlds Database Compromise<br />
If you ever played RIFT or made a Trion Worlds account, you should change your passwords (http://www.trionworlds.com/en/games/account-notification)! <br />
<br />
<br />
We recently discovered that unauthorized intruders gained access to a Trion Worlds account database. The database in question contained information including user names, encrypted passwords, dates of birth, email addresses, billing addresses, and the first and last four digits and expiration dates of customer credit cards.<br />
<br />
There is no evidence, and we have no reason to believe, that full credit card information was accessed or compromised in any way. We have already taken further action to strengthen our systems, even as we, with external security experts, continue to research the extent of the unauthorized access.<br />
<br />
You will notice on your next log in to our website that you will be required to change your password, and existing Mobile Authenticator users will also need to reconnect their Authenticator. When you log in, you will be prompted to provide a new password, security questions and answers, and be given the option to connect your account to our Mobile Authenticator to enhance your account’s security.<br />
<br />
If you have used your username and password for other accounts, especially financial accounts or accounts with personal information, we suggest you change your passwords on those accounts as well. We recommend that you carefully review your statements, account activity, and credit reports to help protect the security of those accounts. If you need information on how to obtain your credit report or believe any such accounts have been breached, please see below for more information.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, if you own the RIFT game, you will be granted three (3) days of complimentary RIFT game time once you update your password and security questions. Additionally, once you update your account and set a new password, your account will be granted a Moneybags’ Purse, which increases your looted coin by 10%, even if you have not yet purchased RIFT. <br />
<br />
<br />
Real ID / BattleTag and Real Names<br />
To be clear - BattleTag does not display your real name to anyone. It's an anonymous nickname system. The entire point of BattleTag is to be a unified, anonymous nickname you'll use across all Blizzard games.<br />
<br />
The Real ID system, of course, does display your real first and last name. But you have to choose to be mutual Real ID friends with someone, and only then will you both see each other's real first and last names.<br />
<br />
Real ID and BattleTag are separate systems, and they don't intersect. The intent with BattleTag is specifically to offer all the great features we've been able to offer with Real ID (cross game chat, etc.) but with an anonymous nickname.<br />
<br />
The game displaying your own real first and last name to you, I understand, is a concern for some, and we appreciate that feedback. It is not, however, displayed to anyone else, or part of the BattleTag system. The only way someone else can see your real name is if you've both mutually agreed to become Real ID friends.<br />
<br />
The current implementation of BattleTags in the Diablo III beta is of course a first go, and we've already read a lot of feedback and are aware of a number of issues. Keep it coming, though. <br />
<br />
<br />
Happy Holidays from the Community Team<br />
The Community team will have a reduced presence on the forums, Twitter and Facebook over the holidays while we unwrap Winterveil presents and ring in a new year with friends and loved ones. We resolve to be back the first week of January. In the meantime, whether in Sanctuary, Azeroth, Mar Sara or beyond, we hope that you and yours share in the warmth of the season… and may all your loot be epic.<br />
<br />
Remember that Greatfather Winter and the Mod Squad are still watching, so be sure to stay on your best behavior. See you next year! <br />

Because that has anything to do with it if he got a kill or not...<br />
<br />
They filtered out 10 man and made a screenshot for their own reasons. Probably because 25 man and 10 man can not race in the same 'league' (if you want to call it that) because they are not the same. You also don't mix 3vs3 arena with 5vs5 arena.<br />
And don't be pissed when they favorite 25 man because that's the format that has always been used for world first races.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This.<br />
<br />
It's sad to see that even despite Blizzard being very clear that 10 and 25 mans are tuned very closely to one another in difficulty, some communities still retain the old-school mindset that the 25 mans are the true standard for progression. There's always the argument that 25 man guilds are harder to keep organized, but at the level of play being examined here, there's never a shortage of geared talent ready to fill in at a moment's notice. Not to mention that while both raids receive the same amount of drops per person, 10 mans see much less of the loot table than 25 mans do on any given encounter, there's much less diversity of gear to loot council out to the raiders fulfilling the most demanding roles. Some mechanics are more difficult to handle on 10 man, others more difficult on 25 man, but all-in-all, progress needs to be accepted equally amongst the two.<br />
<br />
Silent and In extremis deserve just as much if not more applause than Paragon for their Spine kills (both had it down at least 2 full days prior). Major grats to the both of them and shame on the otherwise-awesome Chaud for not giving them the recognition they deserve. MMO-champion has done so much for the WoW community, but with that power comes responsibility.

It's sad to see that even despite Blizzard being very clear that 10 and 25 mans are tuned very closely to one another in difficulty, some communities still retain the old-school mindset that the 25 mans are the true standard for progression. There's always the argument that 25 man guilds are harder to keep organized, but at the level of play being examined here, there's never a shortage of geared talent ready to fill in at a moment's notice. Not to mention that while both raids receive the same amount of drops per person, 10 mans see much less of the loot table than 25 mans do on any given encounter, there's much less diversity of gear to loot council out to the raiders fulfilling the most demanding roles. Some mechanics are more difficult to handle on 10 man, others more difficult on 25 man, but all-in-all, progress needs to be accepted equally amongst the two.<br />
<br />
Silent and In extremis deserve just as much if not more applause than Paragon for their Spine kills (both had it down at least 2 full days prior). Major grats to the both of them and shame on the otherwise-awesome Chaud for not giving them the recognition they deserve. MMO-champion has done so much for the WoW community, but with that power comes responsibility.

You really don't see the problem here? 10 and 25 mans can never be the same so it can never be a fair race. 25 mans have been the race to world first format since TBC and 25 mans are much more fun to watch.<br />
No one in the whole world puts together two different sizes of teams in the same competition. It doesn't work because they are not the same and it's thus not fair.<br />
<br />
We should all see it as two seperate races and they should post two seperate newsposts. One for 10 man and one for 25 man.<br />
<br />
Blizzard can try all they want but it's never going to happen. They are NEVER going to be the same difficulty. Just because they drop the same loot now doesn't mean they are the same in difficulty.</div></div><hr />

I dont know how anyone can even try and argue against this, its spot on.<br />
It really suprises me that Blizzard still have not implemented a seperation between 10 and 25 Achievements when its obvious theres always going to be a bitterness between the two until it happens.</div></div><hr />

Lol this is so retarded. THE MATH IS THERE, 10 man can NEVER be the same as 25. And even Blizzard said &quot;tuned very closley&quot; because they can't tune 25 man and 10 man equally and therefor should never be threated equally. If you have any understanding of math, you can easily sit down and compare a boss in 25 man and 10 man and you'll pretty fast realize that in every case, the numbers doesn't add up and 10 man will always end up easier. Also it's mainly scrubs playing 10 man and blowing everything out of proprtion about difficulties. Why don't you start a 10 man website if you are so interested in 10 man crap raids and you can report however you want.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe they do this because a lot of people care about this news. They post news that the people want to see. <br />
<br />
And barely got a sight on the frontpage? Look again. They had one post for WF spine, one for WF Madness and one with their video of Spine and an interview. Seems like a lot of people have this unexplainable hate towards Paragon. The title of this newspost is not Paragon got world third 25 man Spine kill. No, it's Dragon Soul Progression. So where is this favoritism for Paragon?</div></div><hr />

It's been like that for a long time. They ban people telling the truth about Paragon or in 25v10 discussions even if there's nothing going beyond the civilized discussion. On the other hand, if a person defends paragon/25s he can usually get away with heavy flaming/swearing/trolling. <br />
<br />
I am really amazed at Hereticus's work on that part - he was probably the only one taking care of paragon fanboys crying on these forums when KIN got their kill. Even though people who countered those paragon fanboys got banned themselves by other mods, lol.</div></div><hr />

Silent got World First 10man. MMO-Champ seems to report 25man race on frontpage. <br />

agree with this, and i think its shamefull of mmo-champion they only recognize 25man raiding this way. Cause whenever someone starts a topic about 10 - 25man we are getting infractions.I think its unfair, that eventually we see a flame wars of 10 vs 25 in this post, but all the people that open up their minds on that will get a infration, maybe even a ban. While probaly Chaud who will then have started this flame war will not even get nothing. 10 vs 25 man are both equal.</div></div><hr />

you read it again? ok you see that number? How it says 25? yeah that means there talking about 25 MAN GUILDS. They are world 3rd in 25 man. it says nothing about them being world 3 period. see how it says Dragon Soul 25 Progression Rankings and it has the number 25 shown 3 times in just four sentences.</div></div><hr />

I see the concept of weighted sums and linear algebra is alien to you. Actually, mathematically you can equate both to have the same tuning, yet that would lead to 10-man being more punishing, to the point that it would kill the core of 10-man raiders. Similar to how Naxx-10 was harder than Naxx-25 at WotLK's release, though none of the hardcores that generally do the math did the 10m for the WFs, hence, didn't really need to announce it flaws, we've seen a similar thing happen with t11 as well.<br />
<br />
All in all, the tuning of both difficulties unless you are among those first-100 is pretty much are close, as the ones at the higher margin has the logistics to beat the 10-man handicap that of which that equated its difficulty that of the 25-man. The best example of it is, how Kin Raiders apart from their 50m roster, had entered a fight with 7 mages, 5 rogues and 4 Shaman.<br />
<br />
...and shame on you chaud for living in the previous expansion, as obviously you've only posted 25-man progression.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a phenomenon one can easyily observe around everyone or everything with outstanding success. Does anyone remember the Ensidia Fanboy/Hater times? It was actually completely the same. I never understood, why groups of 'haters' form around every possible successful thing.<br />
<br />
Prominent examples? Look at Justin Bieber! Personally, I never listened to his music, so I don't know if he is really that awful. But I'm quite sure there is a hell lot really hardcore sucking music out there, a lot worse than his music. The only reason for the hate against him is that he has a lot of young and in the eyes of some people kind of annoying fans. But why the hell bother?<br />
<br />
What about that hate against the concern apple? I really am not that much into this stuff to know if apple products are really that bad. But why the hell should I bother? At times when apple was not that succesful, no one cared. Then, a lot of people (some of them kind of annoying in the eyes of others) began to like their products (for whatever reason) and suddenly, there are tons of haters...<br />
<br />
Tell me one good reason, why I should care if some girls suddenly like a book or a movie about vampires? If they are bragging about it all the time, well I stop talking to them, but I would never go to the Internet and write blogs and all kind of stuff about how much I hate this story.<br />
This list could go on for really long, there have always been these kind of haters at all times... (anyone remember Take That?)<br />
<br />
I think it's stupid to do something out of peer preasure and to like something, just because everybody else likes it. But in my opinion, it is just as stupid and kind of pathetic, to hate something and starting a 'anti-cult' for the only reason, that it's liked or loved by sooo many others.<br />
<br />
Same goes here for Paragon. At times where Ensidia dominated WoW, there were a lot of people that just grudged them their success. Then a farily unknown guild names Paragon made a few world firsts, everyone gave their grats to them and had their malicious pleasure for Ensidia. Now, Paragon dominated the Rankings for a long time, actually nothing much has changed since their first WFs and here we go, we have groups of people that just grudge them their success. Just wait a few firstkills, and suddenly we all are going to hate KIN Raiders.<br />
<br />
Why can't everyone just play their own game, cheer for their preferred guild if they want to and grant others succes if they achieve it?<br />

Lol when i wrote &quot;tune equally&quot; i didn't mean that 25 man and 10 man having the exact same numbers? Did you really read it like that? Sad. You can never reach a level where you can say 25 man and 10 man are equally hard, they can be close, I can't argue against that since it can be close. But the math is there to support the fact that it's impossible to achieve the same difficulty in both raid size as it is now.</div></div><hr />

Then that is your choice.<br />
Many other cross-game communications before battle.net did not require email addresses, nor even real names.<br />
Therefore there was no need for that part of RealID in the first place.<br />
It came as a result of a flawed attempt to introduce responsibility for actions on the forums, something which would have been far easier by making a single currently selected character show on all your posts, irrespective of which one was active when the posts were made.</div></div><hr />

This. 10 and 25 are obviously different and meant to be different. We're not comparing Touring car race results to Formula One, even if they'r racing on the same course. It's a different sport, plain and simple. Having reports about 10-man progress would still be nice.</div></div><hr />

Actually, mathematically you can equate both to have the same tuning, yet that would lead to 10-man being more punishing, to the point that it would kill the core of 10-man raiders. Similar to how Naxx-10 was harder than Naxx-25 at WotLK's release, though none of the hardcores that generally do the math did the 10m for the WFs, hence, didn't really need to announce it flaws, we've seen a similar thing happen with t11 as well.<br />
<br />
All in all, the tuning of both difficulties unless you are among those first-100 is pretty much are close, as the ones at the higher margin has the logistics to beat the 10-man handicap that of which that equated its difficulty that of the 25-man. The best example of it is, how Kin Raiders apart from their 50m roster, had entered a fight with 7 mages, 5 rogues and 4 Shaman.<br />
<br />
...and shame on you chaud for living in the previous expansion, as obviously you've only posted 25-man progression.<br />
<br />
10-man more punishing only if you put 25man numbers on the 10man version. And they'll never be the same, that's something nobody can say otherwise. The only way to dream of something like that would involve even map redesign for both versions to achiev things like small space to move for both. Anyway, stop reading at naxx10&gt;naxx25... Guess I know thousands of superb players then... lol.</div></div><hr />

But the math is there to support the fact that it's impossible to achieve the same difficulty in both raid size as it is now.<br />
<br />
Nope, math does not depend only consist of X amount of more damage, it may translate to end-results, however, dynamic features such as how 10-player and 25-player setting would fit are the essentials of the tuning. If blizzard is to tune 10-man with the a model reflecting that of 25-man roster, then you would get a harder 10-man due to how logistics are handled.<br />
<br />
25-man roster holds the possibility of including 80% of game's class specializations whereas this number is reduced to 30% for a 10-man guild, if say this guys were to extend their roster to that of a 20-people group they'd still only be at 65% level of completeness, aka, class stacking is not in favor of 10-man guilds.<br />
<br />
Another factor in it is that how roles are distributed for the raid: Say for 10-man you are to have 2 tanks and 3 healers with the remaining 50% being dps, at most extreme cases this number gets as much as 70%. However, for 25-man, a standard is around 2 tanks, 7 healers and 16 dps, which is 64% of the raid group, whereas when going for the extremity of 1 tank 4 healers, which leaves the raid group with 80% of its remainder being the dps(20 people), even if we are to favor with +1 in healers, this number is still going to be as high as 76%(19 people). <br />
<br />
This was general composition-wise now to relate this with how many dpsers each side has: In the normal case, 25-man is to have around 220% more dps than 10-man, assuming both setups are to get all available buffs, with the extreme case 25-man is to be able to output 170% more, however, bear in mind that this output is more susceptible to a change in 10-man composition's parameters rather than that of 25-man, and Blizzard does not balance the game around the extreme cases, because when they do, they also end-up having to nerf it asap similar to how they had increased rag hc's enrage by 3 more minutes or nerfed some of the healths for spine etc.<br />
<br />
In terms of ideal model the game is balanced, however, it is the human factor that deviates from the model, and taking that into calculations can very well end-up restricting gameplay to a retarded extent that every 10-man guild that is below the first 100 ranking may never get to progress in heroic modes of fights.<br />
<br />
<br />
10-man more punishing only if you put 25man numbers on the 10man version. And they'll never be the same, that's something nobody can say otherwise.

<br />
The post above may be considered as a response to you as well. Regarding map design, the current ones compatible for what you can tune for both with only problem being player perception, hence, the very reason why Blizzard had restricted access to game's functions for add-ons that helped overcoming that factor, aka the AVR...<br />

Appreciate that. If anything, that will hopefully stop the bickering on this thread. <br />

Blizzard can try all they want but it's never going to happen. They are NEVER going to be the same difficulty. Just because they drop the same loot now doesn't mean they are the same in difficulty.<br />

Lol this is so retarded. THE MATH IS THERE, 10 man can NEVER be the same as 25. And even Blizzard said &quot;tuned very closley&quot; because they can't tune 25 man and 10 man equally and therefor should never be threated equally. If you have any understanding of math, you can easily sit down and compare a boss in 25 man and 10 man and you'll pretty fast realize that in every case, the numbers doesn't add up and 10 man will always end up easier. Also it's mainly scrubs playing 10 man and blowing everything out of proprtion about difficulties.

That's why he says it on his profile page, too, as his tag line even. &quot;not good with computers&quot;, pink, turned around. Supposed to be funny, but really just serves to show off to everyone that he can use a div-layer with style information that others can't, making the newbie ask &quot;how does he make the text look like that?&quot; which makes him feel all warm and fuzzy inside because he is just that good. Well, except that the reason the newbie cannot make text like that is because it requires more privileges.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, he's not good with computers, he's got things to learn. I hope he will eventually become as good as Boub.<br />
What I like about Boub? He is completely modest, from the ground up. He works for the community self- and tirelessly. And still, he has a plain profile like ever other user. It shows he is part of us (even though he runs the site), which makes him very sympathetic. Plus, his newsposts are good. Messed up? He admits it, and joins the laugh. Here?<br />

This has a condescending ring to it. Be quiet and move on. Well, and then the unfunny usertag. And nope, I am not trolling. Sorry if feedback hurts.

Oh, Right. Get your facts straight. I'm not sure if you were around at T11 or not, but that shit on 10man was insanely overtuned, With the exception of Al'Akir.

In Tier11 some encounters was harder but mainly due to setup. Now is a different story.<br />

25 human players vs 10 human players alone on that note 25 man will always be harder. I know 10 man guilds don't wanna discuss it and uses buffs/setup as an excuse, but that won't ever change ;)<br />

How come you neglect the MAIN thing making 10 man harder? By that logic I could say &quot;Well some encounters are harder because you're more people but that's a different story&quot;. You need to bring into perspective what it MEANS to only have 10 raiders. You get less raid cooldowns, for one (trust me, i'm feeling this one on Zon'ozz and Ultraxion) It's a bigger deal to swap out a healer etc. instead of losing 14 % of your total healing (assuming 7 healers, I haven't raided 25 man, but you're 2.5x more players, meaning 2.5 times more healers probably) we lose 33% (!) of our total raid healing because of one player. <br />
<br />
Bottom line, you can't say 10 man is easier because you favor 25 man, Nor do I say 10 man is harder ALWAYS. Different bosses are harder on different player settings, Yor'sajh is a shining example of one were 25 man is significantly harder.</div></div><hr />

You get less raid cooldowns, for one (trust me, i'm feeling this one on Zon'ozz and Ultraxion) It's a bigger deal to swap out a healer etc. instead of losing 14 % of your total healing (assuming 7 healers, I haven't raided 25 man, but you're 2.5x more players, meaning 2.5 times more healers probably) we lose 33% (!) of our total raid healing because of one player. <br />
<br />
Bottom line, you can't say 10 man is easier because you favor 25 man, Nor do I say 10 man is harder ALWAYS. Different bosses are harder on different player settings, Yor'sajh is a shining example of one were 25 man is significantly harder.<br />
10 man can cover buffs and 10 man guilds can change the setup just like 25 man, it's just an excuse. I do agree that some encounters are close, but just take Zon'ozz, Unsleeping and Ultraxion, over 5x as many kills in 10 man.<br />
<br />
You don't need the same amount of dps, healing, cooldowns, combatress etc. because it's not the same encounter...<br />
<br />
25 man raiding isn't 10 man content with 25 people. But for some reason 10 man guilds think it is ;)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZenX</div><div class="date">2011-12-23, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In Tier11 some encounters was harder but mainly due to setup. Now is a different story.<br />
<br />
25 human players vs 10 human players alone on that note 25 man will always be harder. I know 10 man guilds don't wanna discuss it and uses buffs/setup as an excuse, but that won't ever change ;)<br />
<br />
I don't say 10 man is easy, but it is easier than 25 man. <br />
<br />
<br />
quick we have to buff mages now, they are lowest on dps.....lolObviously arcane sacrifices sustained dps for ultra burst dmg, but we all know that. I think they are pretty balanced.as for 10v25?meh to me 25man is the yardstick for world first progression, it always has been, it always will be. I dont even bother to look at 10man results or guilds. This tier especially is far harder on 25man, heroics even more so. But thats not even the point. 25man (or whatever the largest size is) will ALLWAYS be the yardstick for world 1st progression, and so it should be.<br />
<br />
Seeing how it made to the end of a page, I'm going to quote myself for some of you blind...<br />
<br />
<br />
Nope, math does not depend only consist of X amount of more damage, it may translate to end-results, however, dynamic features such as how 10-player and 25-player setting would fit are the essentials of the tuning. If blizzard is to tune 10-man with the a model reflecting that of 25-man roster, then you would get a harder 10-man due to how logistics are handled.<br />
<br />
25-man roster holds the possibility of including 80% of game's class specializations whereas this number is reduced to 30% for a 10-man guild, if say this guys were to extend their roster to that of a 20-people group they'd still only be at 65% level of completeness, aka, class stacking is not in favor of 10-man guilds.<br />
<br />
Another factor in it is that how roles are distributed for the raid: Say for 10-man you are to have 2 tanks and 3 healers with the remaining 50% being dps, at most extreme cases this number gets as much as 70%. However, for 25-man, a standard is around 2 tanks, 7 healers and 16 dps, which is 64% of the raid group, whereas when going for the extremity of 1 tank 4 healers, which leaves the raid group with 80% of its remainder being the dps(20 people), even if we are to favor with +1 in healers, this number is still going to be as high as 76%(19 people). <br />
<br />
This was general composition-wise now to relate this with how many dpsers each side has: In the normal case, 25-man is to have around 220% more dps than 10-man, assuming both setups are to get all available buffs, with the extreme case 25-man is to be able to output 170% more, however, bear in mind that this output is more susceptible to a change in 10-man composition's parameters rather than that of 25-man, and Blizzard does not balance the game around the extreme cases, because when they do, they also end-up having to nerf it asap similar to how they had increased rag hc's enrage by 3 more minutes or nerfed some of the healths for spine etc.<br />
<br />
In terms of ideal model the game is balanced, however, it is the human factor that deviates from the model, and taking that into calculations can very well end-up restricting gameplay to a retarded extent that every 10-man guild that is below the first 100 ranking may never get to progress in heroic modes of fights.<br />
<br />
The post above may be considered as a response to you as well. Regarding map design, the current ones compatible for what you can tune for both with only problem being player perception, hence, the very reason why Blizzard had restricted access to game's functions for add-ons that helped overcoming that factor, aka the AVR...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, adding on to this is how the bias of &quot;More heroic kills in X 10-man because it is easier in 10-man&quot;, however, what you nimrods can't comprehend is that there are more 10-man guilds then there are 25-man guilds. To be exact with numbers, the number of guilds who has Morchok on Normal are 3780 in 25-man and 31716 in 10-man. <br />
So upon making comparison for a percentage of boss kills, you at least need to take the number of kills for the entry boss for the instance, so that a more healthy comparison could be made. <br />
<br />
Hence, stop it with your 25 &gt; 10 threads, just because you want to be the hipster-cool guy in forums or show-off how much of an idiot you can be, or just cry to Blizzard regarding it, with them if not being frustrated enough with answering such questions already,would respond to you that these fights are balanced around factors you are incapable of comprehending...</div></div><hr />

Thats not gonna happen, nor should it. It's not really a valid concern for them whatever one camp think the other is easier or not. As long as both settings are (SOMEWHAT) comparable thats all that matters.<br />
<br />
They will never be equal whatever its 25 being harder than 10 on some encounters or 10 being harder than 25 on another encounter, its impossible for them to be equal.</div></div><hr />

Stars had the benefit of knowing the raid comp Kin used and Paragon actually had the benefit of watching the technique vid from Kin (since it was released on the 21st and they downed the encounter on the 22nd) before killing the encounter. Which misses the point: even if Paragon had gotten the kill in 5 attempts over an hour after coming back from the ban, it's still their own damn fault for cheating.

Sigh as I've stated times and times again, 10-man and 25-man can be made equal, however, we would end-up paying up with even further homogenized specs to the point that we'd essentially end up with:<br />
1- Tanks<br />
2- Healers<br />
3- Casters<br />
4- Melee<br />
5- Pet-assisted<br />
<br />
Furthermore, such an optimization would either yield undertuned or overtuned (all) bosses for both difficulties, this tier was a pretty much close one, the only problem is how players have interpreted the data of kills for respective difficulties in a wrong resulting in the same flame-war...</div></div><hr />

We get it, you want credit and you don't want people to tell you you're doing the easymode version of encounters. I'm sure 10M heroic modes can be tough, but they'll never be as difficult as 25M heroic modes, period. It's ridiculous how touchy people get on this subject, and they'll go as far as to being completely blind to avoid having their insignificant achievements on a game become undervalued somehow. <br />
<br />
Either way, you're raiding 10man for a reason, and chances are it's not for the &quot;added difficulty&quot; (it doesn't have one rofl), it's because you'd RATHER play 10man, or your pc can't handle 25man, and theres nothing wrong with that. <br />
<br />
Look at it this way, even if blizz managed to balance 25 and 10man versions of encounters perfectly so that both have the same difficulty (impossible, because of the very nature of the lockouts, but whatever), NOBODY would still care about 10man raiding. 25man has always been the world first race/meaningful progression format, and that's not changing anytime soon. If you're in it for the difficulty and the e-glory (lolol) then raid 25man, if you're there to enjoy the game with 9 of your friends, or your pc can't handle 25man, play 10man, and compliment yourself and your teammates on jobs well done everytime you down a boss, cause chances are not alot of people will care.</div></div><hr />

I'm not saying anything about which is harder, I haven't raided since WotLK so I can't judge the difficulties. I just want to say that your math is flawed. You have a 2/3/5 comp in 10man, you bench 1 healer and have 66% of healing and 120% of dps. On 25 you have 2/6/17 comp (at least that's what I presume from the damage meter in this post), you bench a healer and you have 83% of healing but only 106% of damage. Even when you bench 2 healers, you have the same healing as if you bench 1 healer on 10 man but only 111% of your former damage. Ergo benching healers is actually better damage increase mathematically on 10 man than on 25. (The fact that finetuning the right amount is harder in lower amounts of people is a different thing though, that you should've mentioned instead)</div></div><hr />

So because you've stated it several times it's a fact that everyone should just agree to...aha. 25 man has 15 HUMANS more and that's a huge factor. In my mind there's to many factors, it's not equal now and won't be just because you state your oppinion several times.<br />
<br />
May I ask, you raid 10 man right? Have you tried both?<br />

You have your opinion and that's just fine, we don't have to agree ;)<br />
<br />
I have raided 25 for the entirety of WotLK, while still doing 10m, and had progressed 10m and 25m alike in t11, and switched 10m for t12 after I have returned from my hiatus, where I had found my guild both migrated and FC'd with a reduction to 10m.<br />
<br />
As I have stated in my posts, it is not about there 15 people more, but rather how their performance is effective compared to their raid size, with how compositions yielding more variant possibilities in 25m than 10m, making it more versatile, with that possibility of versatility may get reflected to difficulty to the point that people mistake it for 25m being difficult than 10m due to how they had upon their transition had hand-picked the better one from their greater roster of supposedly good players. This is similar to how people argue regarding how Baleroc was harder due to its while they were very well able to orchestrate a tactic of kiting him at enrage, with a scenario of 2 players being ineligible to dps at such a time would translate 6 players for 25m.<br />
<br />
I think it is the general part of playerbase who is the flag carrier to the idea of 25m&gt;10m, that thinks that 10m is 25m tuned for 20 people less, while it isn't.<br />
In essence, it is similar to how Frost DW and Unholy dps is for DKs(t13), while they are really close in sims, the upper limit is dependent on how well the player can channel their execution capabilities regarding the mechanics of respective fights. However, people only argue one being more easier to play than the other solely due to how many top end players or &quot;scrubs&quot; play them, while considering the spec EZ mode due how a Frost 2H that does not care for the diseases gets to steamroll you in BGs due to you having no-resi gear on you etc.<br />
<br />
Specs are close enough similar to how BM and MM is close to each other on sims, while top raiders, have to be MM due to sustain that small difference of 3.6%, while this does not translate for the lower-end players who wouldn't see something more than 1% of a difference, and at the time they reach the same boss, if that 1% really matters that is due some other player in the group no doing their work properly.<br />
<br />
Simply put, in such topics of discussion(Be it 10m or 25m being argued to be harder or easier) how every other person trying uphold their argument as a fact while disregarding everyone else, yet trying go under the &quot;opinion&quot; rock whenever their argument is proven to be void, rather just admitting they're wrong and retreat.<br />
<br />
What I simply want, is provide proper proof if you are trying to argue on such matters, and if you don't have the balls/vagina to do that, your just flaming.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lerrielin</div><div class="date">2011-12-23, 06:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All this debate about what MMO-Champ should track and shouldn't track... fundamentally isn't MMO-Champ not an official WoW site? It's a godly site, but at the end of the day shouldn't the standard that it decides to follow be determined by what the staff of MMO-Champion, not by Blizzard or anyone else for that matter? <br />
<br />
As far as I see it, debates are fine, but some people are strutting about with misplaced and way out of proportion senses of entitlement acting like they somehow know better than all the folks that put this site together and asserting what MMO-Champ NEEDS to comment on regarding progression. <br />
<br />
It's not like the info isn't out there. Sites like WoWProgress and Guildox shows what's being done at a glance (albeit a bit clumsily for some groups, though this usually isn't a problem for world top guilds as these guilds won't be doing raiding alliances and the like, which is what can confuse these tracking sites). <br />
<br />
Besides, to those people asserting things along the line of Blizzard &quot;counting&quot; progression, last I checked there wasn't even a blue-based compilation of kills, achievements and relative dates of accomplishment outside of manually digging through Armory, which is what non-official sites like WoWProgress and Guildox automatically pull from. TLDR: If it upsets you THAT MUCH, go make your own site, build it up like MMO-Champ did, and then you can show/comment on whatever way you'd want to do with the progression rankings. For everyone else who are sensible enough to participate in discussions, happy holidays! :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
As I have stated in my posts, it is not about there 15 people more, but rather how their performance is effective compared to their raid size, with how compositions yielding more variant possibilities in 25m than 10m, making it more versatile, with that possibility of versatility may get reflected to difficulty to the point that people mistake it for 25m being difficult than 10m due to how they had upon their transition had hand-picked the better one from their greater roster of supposedly good players.

<br />
But make you a bet, 25 man is going to be cut from wow in the expansion after Pandaland aside from 25 LFR. So until that i am going to raid 25 man and you will raid 10 man and hopefully we both will be happy about it ;)</div></div><hr />

You're a big fat phony. We didn't news Paragon in ages (probably since they got banned/apologized), I did however news a korean first kill while I was on a fucking plane (https://twitter.com/#!/Boubouille_MMO/status/148123779787268097/photo/1), don't go all QQ favoritism on me. :(</div></div><hr />

The content is tuned/balanced around the number of players that the mode supports, nothing more. More 10man kills doesnt mean its easier, (i thought this would be clear even to the not so bright individuals out there), it just means that there are more 10 man guilds out there because, (and i can vouch for this coming from eu's lowest populated server), it can be nightmare to put a 25 man squad together. <br />
<br />
Until blizz say otherwise why dont you just stick a freaking cork in it cos its getting boring and...this may come as a shock to a lot of you...we really dont care!! Are things really that bad for you in real life that stroking your ego and thinking your better than someone else because of what size squad you raid in an MMO make you feel better? Its pathetic and i feel sorry for you, you people give this game a bad name. None of you have any proof to back your claims, its all just ego-inflated opinions. <br />

<br />
Actually, with how raiding turned out to be with t12, aka having to rip your ass for 2 months to see the same bosses become easier in the same cycle through nerfs to the point that you could have killed them almost 10% of the time you've spent, I had simply quit the raiding scene, and had quit the game until blizzcon where they had announced modes that would allow others to see story development through easier modes(aka PvE Scenarios and LFR) for accessibility which made me happy, as the way I played the game previously didn't seem natural to me as I am the kind of person that would spend 90% of his free-time for finishing a novel. Except LFR, I'm not touching raiding, and assuming that DW HC modes has no additional story elements to add-in to the game, I won't be stepping up to do anything above LFR for at least 1-2 months.<br />
<br />
Regarding how raids are to be modified, only the time will tell, as a prediction for 25m's removal is just too early to be thrown.</div></div><hr />

Then Ensidia got Naxx and EoE, Method got OS103D, Ensidia got most of Uld, Irae AoD One Light and Stars Alone in the Darkness, Paragon got Anub'Arak and HLK.

<br />
I would presume that they are playing both games. But I highly expect the MoP world first races to be a bunch of guilds we never heard of, and the &quot;big&quot; guilds already over completely switched to SWTOR by that time.<br />
<br />
That is, assuming that SWTOR can have the complexity that WOW bosses have. (The one mid-level raid I watched looked like they have it down already)</div></div><hr />

We get it, you want credit and you don't want people to tell you you're doing the easymode version of encounters. I'm sure 10M heroic modes can be tough, but they'll never be as difficult as 25M heroic modes, period. It's ridiculous how touchy people get on this subject, and they'll go as far as to being completely blind to avoid having their insignificant achievements on a game become undervalued somehow. <br />
<br />
Either way, you're raiding 10man for a reason, and chances are it's not for the &quot;added difficulty&quot; (it doesn't have one rofl), it's because you'd RATHER play 10man, or your pc can't handle 25man, and theres nothing wrong with that. <br />
<br />
Look at it this way, even if blizz managed to balance 25 and 10man versions of encounters perfectly so that both have the same difficulty (impossible, because of the very nature of the lockouts, but whatever), NOBODY would still care about 10man raiding. 25man has always been the world first race/meaningful progression format, and that's not changing anytime soon. If you're in it for the difficulty and the e-glory (lolol) then raid 25man, if you're there to enjoy the game with 9 of your friends, or your pc can't handle 25man, play 10man, and compliment yourself and your teammates on jobs well done everytime you down a boss, cause chances are not alot of people will care.<br />
<br />
<br />
Im wondering why if 10m heroic is so easy why paragon, the supposed best guild in the world (untill now) could not down it with 7 days trying before they went up to 25man?</div></div><hr />
