Wonder why there are so many more different melee weapons, compared to the amount of caster weapons available...<br />
<br />
I was wondering the same thing. As a mage who thus can't use maces or shields, doesn't feel staves are an option since they're always less spellpower than a 1H/OH combo at the same ilvl, and doesn't need hit since everything in Ulduar is swimming in it, I have in 25-man Ulduar a grand total of two mainhand, one offhand, and two wand options *including* hard mode drops seen so far.<br />
<br />
It's not really much better than it used to be when everyone wanted everything KT dropped and nothing else from all of Naxx. It's just not all on Yogg this time, but there are still one or two drops per slot every single caster (and sometimes healer) in the raid wants while the rest get sharded or people grudgingly take as a temporary stopgap. Yay poor itemization!</div></div><hr />

Because there are more types of melee weapons with much less crossover in stats than casters have. The same reason there's more plate gear than mail.</div></div><hr />

That comic was a bit difficult to follow, I don't think it was accurately illustrated. Punch-line didn't seem humorous either or at least the way they tried to deliver it. Thanks for the explanation because the comic had me lost.<br />

<br />
<br />
Staff of Endless Winter is the Mage best in slot weapon for both Fire and Frostfire. If you're Arcane or Frost, then you probably shouldn't be caring about what is best for your class since you're playing an inferior spec for Ulduar to begin with.<br />
<br />
There's one thing people fail to realize when comparing MH/OH to Staves now... we have a Staff enchant which helps makes up for the loss of Spell Power. Also remember, we get Crit from Spirit now. (84 spirit on the Staff = 46.2 crit = 150.2 crit rating on the staff). Then add on the 2 sockets with a +9SP bonus. It's the perfect place to put those stupid blue gems nobody wants. <br />
<br />
Have you even looked at the MH/OH combos in Ulduar? The only main hand weapon that is a true upgrade to TTT, is the 25 Yogg HM weapon. The rest are barely sidegrades, and in some cases (depending on what stats you need/want) downgrades.<br />
<br />
Ulduar itemization wouldn't look so bad if Naxx wasn't itemized so well. <br />
<br />
And I agree with another poster... Teh Gladiators is horrible. I never read it for obvious reasons, decided to click on it today, and realized why I never read it. :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm TTW fire. Frostfire is, by the way, just as inferior as Arcane according to Rawr.<br />
<br />
The only reason the Staff of Endless Winter is BIS is it is the only ilvl 239 weapon that doesn't have hit on it. Show me the 1H dagger or sword without hit that's ilvl 239. If it existed, it would be better than the Staff of Endless Winter.<br />
<br />
The staff isn't better because of an enchant that gives another 18 spellpower. It's better because it's 7 ilvls above the only meaningful 1H options. (Hit options aren't really options since the tier is already swimming in it.)<br />
<br />
This tier is horrible for casters. They added 800 items, and about 8 of them are for mages or locks. And we share desire for all the same pieces. Makes for a bad chance of getting any upgrades. We sure do create a lot of abyss crystals these days though.<br />
<br />
<br />
Have you even looked at the MH/OH combos in Ulduar? The only main hand weapon that is a true upgrade to TTT, is the 25 Yogg HM weapon. The rest are barely sidegrades, and in some cases (depending on what stats you need/want) downgrades.<br />
<br />
Runescribed Blade off normal mode Auriaya is an upgrade for Turning Tide as well. And better than Yogg normal mode Soulscribe. But there are NO 25-man hard mode non-hit 1H options. Zero. Zilch. It's a gigantic gaping hole in the itemization, and forces us to use a staff that's inherently lower power than a 1H non-hit ilvl 239 item would be. (Best in slot doesn't necessarily mean GOOD, sometimes it just means the best of the terrible choices available.) I keep hoping someone discovers a nice 239 sword without hit.<br />
<br />
Edit: To illustrate my point, go into Rawr and edit the Runescribed Blade (BIS 1H) and give it 587 spellpower, the amount it'd have if it were ilvl 239. It should even have a gem slot since the Starshard Edge does (which isn't even in Rawr for now) but even without that, it pops out ahead of Staff of Endless Winter. The fact there are no ilvl 239 offhands to put it with even holds it back, but it'd STILL be better than an awful stat-heavy spell-light staff. Edit Ironmender into the stats of Wisdom's Hold (the only ilvl 239 off-hand, a damn SHIELD) and suddenly this hypothetical ilvl 239 Runescribed Blade with a hypothetical ilvl 239 Ironmender comes out a TON ahead of the staff. The staff is a consolation prize for Blizzard being unable to give us the good options we need to be properly powerful at ilvl 239.</div></div><hr />
