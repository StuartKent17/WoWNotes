That has nothing to do with what i'm talking about.<br />
<br />
Right now i log on twice a week to raid the same stuff over and over. Next patch, same thing. I won't do the troll heroics because i don't need gear. There is absolutely nothing wrong with having more than 1 set of raids out at the same time to keep people busy.<br />
<br />
If 4.2 were to come out, i'd log on to raid 3 or 4 times a week plus the new dailies and zones, etc.<br />
<br />
4.1 is going to make no difference for anybody thats done even the normal mode raids. Its a long wait, for nothing big.</div></div><hr />

I don't. Raiding and, more specifically, tanking are the funnest things I have ever done in a video game. You guys claim to be complaining about a &quot;lack of content,&quot; when really what you're complaining about is a lack of content that caters specifically to your tastes. If you don't like to raid and overcome difficult heroic challenges with 9 or 24 other people, then your options are severely limited. Sure, Blizzard could add in more single player functions, but the meat of the game will always be raids and PvP. If you don't like to raid or interact with other people, what are you doing in an MMO?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Raiding is fun.. theres nothing wrong with raiding. I don't agree with having to do the same boss twice, once normal once heroic, but whatever works.<br />
<br />
You can only raid for so long before you clear everything for that week. What do you do after you've done your 2 nights of raiding? I do some arena until i get frustrated enough to call it quits, but thats it.<br />
<br />
Once you've gotten your honor gear from bgs, there is no reason to do them anymore. Once you've gotten your points in arena, its only fun for so long until you get owned by facerolling warriors and get fed up. You can only raid so much in one week, especially when it only happens is 9 or 24 more people are online.<br />
<br />
Its not interesting anymore.<br />
<br />
It has nothing to do with not liking playing an mmo, its that the mmo has 2 things to do, one being something you can only do for a few hours a week, and the other is the same crap over and over again facing the same 3s comps hoping you get one that isn't going to counter you.<br />
<br />
I don't know what it is thats so different about cataclysm, but i've never been so bored with the current content as i am now.</div></div><hr />

Say the patch comes last week of April which is most likely will, they won't put 4.2 on the PTR until beginning of June the earliest. Then another 2-2 1/2 months before it goes live.

Raiding and, more specifically, tanking are the funnest things I have ever done in a video game. You guys claim to be complaining about a &quot;lack of content,&quot; when really what you're complaining about is a lack of content that caters specifically to your tastes. If you don't like to raid and overcome difficult heroic challenges with 9 or 24 other people, then your options are severely limited. Sure, Blizzard could add in more single player functions, but the meat of the game will always be raids and PvP. If you don't like to raid or interact with other people, what are you doing in an MMO?<br />
<br />
Raiding 12/12 is fine and fun, but doing the same bosses AGAIN because now they drop items with a few more stat points and have 1 or 2 new abilities is not fun for a lot of people. Why is it so hard to just put the challenge there for the bosses originally, or meet it half way to at least cause people to progress a little slower. Heroic modes are not new content, some of them are interesting and very very hard, but some of them are made difficult in the most as-sine way you can imagine. Kind of like heroic ramparts in BC just meant everything hit you 5x harder then usual..yeah that was &quot;heroic&quot;.<br />
<br />
This sort of content pushing was fine back in Vanilla and for a MMO that's starting out, WoW has been out for a long time now and yet the content releases are still pretty much the same in terms of time and content...why is that? Why has the development not evolved more? Why has the money that has been made not gone to further the overall experience of the game?</div></div><hr />

My point was that the original work wasn't credited, unless the original work was done by the same artist and he later simply added a mage to it. Which judging by his other artwork it could very well be. I'm not saying the copy I have is better by any means, simply posting it to show that there was an original before the WoW related addition.</div></div><hr />

Oddly enough, I was just talking about that the other day.

<br />
1. Blizzards goal to make raid content more accessible to the playerbase was extremely successful in wrath, but it had the unfortunate side effect of allowing most semi-serious raiding guilds to steamroll through the normal mode content. The relative ease of the content meant players were spending less of their playtime actually in the raids and more in the overworld. <br />
<br />
2. Blizzards efforts to make single player content less grindy. This was also wildly successful in wrath, with the vast majority of factions having rep tabards, and very simple quick daily grinds. <br />
<br />
These two factors together meant that the player would run out of things to do much more quickly than in BC or Vanilla, where rep grinds were torturously long, raids had a very high barrier to entry, and heroics were hours long time investments each. Wrath had one thing going for it that cata does not however, heirlooms. The implementation of heirlooms was a massive success for Wrath. When 'finished' the solo end game content, leveling alts was more fun than ever before, providing much needed relief, and, eventually, a whole new batch of things to do at the end game. <br />
<br />
Trouble is, there was so much downtime between raid tiers in wrath that people leveled a lot of alts. Anyone who's played the BoA enchant market can attest to the sheer volume of alts people were leveling. Now many/most raid oriented players have all the alts that their interested in. I myself only had 1 max level character until the very end of BC when i finally got a second toon to 70. My roster now consists of 5 85's, and a toon of at least level 70 of every other class except rogues. There are simply no more alts to make.<br />
<br />
So you have easy solo content, extremely accessible 5 man content (even bad heroics groups take less time than skilled runs in BC), the smallest ever physical expansion of the end game world, and no alt leveling. This is why long time players are burning out.<br />
<br />
I myself allowed my account to expire last week and won't be renewing until 4.2<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
TL;DR: Blizzards efforts to cut out the downtime between actually doing things was too successful, and leaves many feeling like they've run out of things to do.</div></div><hr />

The sloppy work from Blizzard is for all to see. 4.1 should be out at least 2 weeks ago and nothing is happening. More and more ppl are quitting raids cause quite frankly there is a expiration date on how often you can do the same stuff before dying of boredom. <br />
<br />
Im growing more and more into RIFT - it has some great endgame content that ppl are just starting to realise. I just hope that we dont get the 12 year old kids coming to destroy the game. The comunity on my server is fantastic. And always something to do !</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, I raid heroic raid content and I PvP. Yes, I'm out of things to do, except for the raiding evenings. Fun? Not so much. Alts? 5 at 85 and 2 more incoming. 4.1 won't bring me anything new except making my honor grind a bit less painful. Well, woopedeedoo. The whole PvP reward thing should have been fixed eons ago at Cata's launch anyway.<br />
<br />
I'm sure a lot of people will enjoy the revamp of ZG/ZA for the first week or two, but what do you do when you've exhausted those, after?<br />

<br />
this, plus the fact that you don't pay for loot anymore, you pay for ilvl. Reforging, while looking like a great tool at first, makes players only care about ilvl and not the items themselves.<br />
With the amount of loot dropping from 25man, it's extremely easy to gear up, even if the items are not BIS.<br />
In the end, you end up not needing real upgrades MUCH faster than before, and thus removed the need to go kill a certain boss. <br />
When caped with currencies, with almost nothing to spend it on, when you don't need gear from farm content, seriously, why still go kill a boss?</div></div><hr />

2: Firelands will come out about june / july and we will be in there until Xmas with maybe a 5 man AQ rehash thrown in for good measure ( I mean there is not much old content left to bring back). Then we will see the deathwing raid and a new ICC will be born</div></div><hr />

I was in a not particularly good raid guild at the beginning of wotlk. We had cleared all of Naxx in around a month after the expansion launched, after 2 - 2 1/2 months all my gear was best in slot bar the drops from OS 3D and Malygos, which like many guilds mine was incapable of doing.<br />
<br />
So not exactly clear how things are more boring now? I stopped playing before Ulduar hit and didn't come back till ToC as there was nothing to do. My DK had pretty much the best tanking gear going and even my Shaman alt had pretty much everything going.<br />

Take the actual size of the &quot;outlands&quot; zone for The Burning Crusade and the size of &quot;northrend&quot; for Wrath of the Lich King expansion and compare to the content you have now to do. The zones are spread out and boring. Bad phasing is bad.<br />
<br />
Honestly what is there to do but farm while you que for dungeons? In all honesty i got the cata quest achiv leveling my dk. as my main i finished each zone for the rep and higher end rewards so i was ahead of the game a lil bit when i hit 85... when i was done i had nothing to do 3-4days max ALL quests done.

Interesting that Blizzard is adding more cooking/fishing dailies to the game. I wonder what exactly is the intended purpose behind such a move?

I wonder what exactly is the intended purpose behind such a move? Don't get me wrong, it may be useful for helping skill up those professions (perhaps even a new achievement or two) for altoholics such as myself, but I feel this is something of a lower priority.<br />
<br />
I suspect it is a first step in getting people to visit the other capitol cities which are now ghost towns. There is currently little reason to visit any city other than Orgrimmar / Stormwind.</div></div><hr />

Like everyone else I totally love that Org wallpaper! I do have one teeny gripe about it. All the guards are the same exact orc. No skin color variation, no different hairstyles, they're all the exact same model. Other than that it is totally amazing!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Say the patch comes last week of April which is most likely will, they won't put 4.2 on the PTR until beginning of June the earliest. Then another 2-2 1/2 months before it goes live. For the first time in four years I'm really dissapointed in Blizz. Going from 3.0 to ulduar was only about five months.<br />
<br />
So you work for blizzard and can 100% confirm that 4.2 wont be on the ptr till june? Cause if you do thats pretty cool if not you need to stop talking like you know whats gonna happen. If this patch was 4.0.9 no one would be as upset as they are. I personally laugh that people are so upset by this. I still log on raid with my guild 3 days a week do an alt raid 1 day a week pvp 2 days and do 3-4 heroics a day for all my alts. If you cant find something in this game you still enjoy doing maybe you should quit.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">F-Minus</div><div class="date">2011-04-11, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They invested way to much for revamping old zones and not delivering enough new content for level 85 folks. Why should a level 80 guy care about revamped quests chains from 1-60. Yes the revamped zones look nice, but after I flew over them once, I've seen enough and do not wish to revisit, except when I level an alt and even then...<br />
<br />
Well if we look at it, 85 is not 90 half the content. Also half the stuff that was shown at Blizzcon was cut from the release game. No guild Talent Trees, no Path of Titans etc. etc. quite sad. <br />
<br />
The scattered new zones also don't help the cause. If I want to go to Twilight from Uldum, I have to HS to Orgrimmar and port there, doesn't make sense in the slightest. At least they should make portal hubs in each of the new zone to every new zone - to make them feel coherent. Every major city should have the same portals, cause right now, every city except Orgrimmar and Stormwind is dead - even worse as Darnassus was up to this point. <br />
<br />
Dungeons and Raids are fine, but are getting stale now. New content is badly needed. <br />
<br />
All in all I think we expect more from the game as the engine is able to deliver without a complete overhaul. Some of us play this game for ~7 years now, so ofc we're going to get bored quicker as people who just picked up with Cataclysms release. That said, I think they should make 2 teams, one that focuses on game content (raids, dungeons, zones, quests, balance, etc..) and one team that tries to move the core game engine forward to new standard, graphic and physics wise - and don't get me wrong, the art style is fantastic, but the low-res everything is not. Instead of having a rivet drawn it could easily be modeled by now, the windows could be glass instead of flat solid textures by now. We can't even get new high-poly character models, which I think it's really sad and all Blizzard comes up is some excuses.</div></div><hr />

Which judging by his other artwork it could very well be. I'm not saying the copy I have is better by any means, simply posting it to show that there was an original before the WoW related addition.<br />
<br />
The copy you have is basically the art with name cut out. The artist that made the background (a long time ago) is a well-known artist Greg Martin. What I wonder is why someone used it as a background, put there the WoW toon, and posted it... without even mentioning his name, but leaving the name of the background artist. It's not Greg Martin who did the toon, he's basically more concerned with.. you know, real artwork, as you can probably see from his gallery. <br />

EVERYTHING is ALWAYS pushed back. All Blizz has said is that 4.2 will go on the PTR Soon(TM) after 4.1 releases. God knows when that will be. I agree we won't see it before July. At this point I'm thinking maybe late Aug/early Sept. :/</div></div><hr />

Can say whatever you want, but going so long without new content is inexecusable. Considering we won't see the new raid before June - and that's if we're lucky - no, honestly, I find that rather outrageous. Cata's current content has been exhausted weeks ago.<br />
<br />
Yes, I raid heroic raid content and I PvP. Yes, I'm out of things to do, except for the raiding evenings. Fun? Not so much. Alts? 5 at 85 and 2 more incoming. 4.1 won't bring me anything new except making my honor grind a bit less painful. Well, woopedeedoo. The whole PvP reward thing should have been fixed eons ago at Cata's launch anyway.<br />
<br />
I'm sure a lot of people will enjoy the revamp of ZG/ZA for the first week or two, but what do you do when you've exhausted those, after?<br />
<br />
I whine. Yes. I'm in a whinemood. I enjoy the game overall but I just can't stomach the lack of fun additions to the game to supplement my raiding evenings.<br />
<br />
I think what they've missed in improving the quality of life for players (i.e. everything's easier, more streamlined, less of a grind) is that it means that people will be out of shit to do. They need more content desperately, but instead their content patch development has grinded to a halt because they're making some sort of retarded MMO FPS, and Bobby Kotick won't sign the check for additional developers, when lost subscriptions can be made up for by selling TRH to idiots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They really failed the fans hard this expansion, and actually prior to Cata's launch with twelve months of ICC. You have to remember, this company is not what they used to be. They'll lie to fans for a quick buck anymore, remember &quot;BoA cross-realms&quot;, &quot;New Dances&quot;, and &quot;MORE content, FASTER&quot;? They released a half-baked expansion, as you can tell since &quot;Firelands&quot; got removed, 5 levels, low amounts of new zones, etc. Firelands was worked on the same time everything else was. So what happened? Going by blizzard's track record, LAZINESS. They probably wanted to, and probably still are holding it back so they have it easy to relax during their release schedule. Themselves saying they moved their A, B, and C teams onto Titan, D3, and SC2, while leaving people with limited experience working on this game has shown they just don't care anymore, and the end product has shown this itself. <br />
<br />
The game is in the most miserable shape it has ever been in before right here, right now, and the worst part is it has finally gotten a worthy competitor to the MMO scene. I'm actually curious to how many people either; cancelled to play Rift, let their subs run out since they're playing it, or are playing both at the same time. I'm curious to how much their sub base has finally dropped do to their epic follies.<br />
<br />
The sad part is, WoW is at it's most profitable state right now, thus people thought they'd put equal investment back int the game instead of putting the mass of profits into their other projects seemingly. People came back in droves hoping that Cata would jump-start WoW to what it was in it's prime. They all just came back to see that blizzard just DOES NOT CARE about the fans anymore. To be honest, if they said &quot;we still care&quot;, i'm calling BS just as their latest QA's have proven they're lost, they're not the same blizzard anymore. They all think that their fans are suffering from Stockholm Syndrome and will let them get away with everything from putting far less effort into the quality of the game, far less urgency into getting content out faster which they promised they would, and recycling mass amounts of content/assets. 4.1 has a bunch of stuff nobody asked for in it, and 4.2 was a 7-boss raid last we heard, and this isn't good for replay value sakes for the players.<br />
<br />
Blizzard, if someone there is reading this, I'd just like to say thanks for the good times through BC, but it was all downhill from there. I thought Wrath was a fluke, but at this point it's clear it was just an indication of worse things to come. You guys really failed me, one of your long time fans, and I'm sure I'm not alone. When 4.1 hits, I won't come back for recycled content and features I don't care about that has little to no impact on the game. When 4.2 hits, I probably won't be back then as well, since after I put my time into it, and get quickly burnt out on 7-bosses, I'll be in the same state again. Thus, I'm just saving my money up, putting it into other games instead.<br />
<br />
I honestly believe we're looking at the real beginnings of the fall of WoW here, in various ways. It was a good ride through BC, bumpy in Wrath, and now it's just an empty husk of what it used to be at one time, it's on life-support now basically. Can't believe this happened to my favorite game of all time. Can't believe it's being done by &quot;PC gaming's savior Dev&quot;. If it weren't for Steam right now, PC gaming would be a thing of the past, and Valve isn't doing much better for us outside of their tops DD system. I have to turn to consoles to get my fix anymore...</div></div><hr />

As for Patch 4.1 - not so stunning work. Talk about a HUGE filler patch. Recycle and padded with fluff, it's an distraction technique and nothing more. It's looking like we're going to be seeing 4.1 sometime in May, a full 6 months since the Cataclysm. Thats not a good situation for Blizzard. And then probably another month, possibly 2, until 4.2 hits with some real content? Ouch.</div></div><hr />

The idea of the daily fishing quests in Orgrimmar/Stormwind was a given with the focus back on the old world, but to add nothing in the way of incentive or reward with &quot;new&quot; content seemed sloppy...<br />
<br />
The new fishing and cooking quests are mainly for people who are leveling up near those cities. The bags offer the same loot and you can only do ONE quest per day, now you just get to pick the city. Theoretically, you now have a better chance of doing a daily that gives 2 tokens, since if the ogrimmar is for 1 token, you can check the other two cities and possibly get a 2 token one there.<br />
<br />
But mainly these quests were for people leveling a tauren or undead who don´t want to go to ogrimmar for daily quests.<br />

<br />
GC needs to learn to focus and to learn what the term ´feature creep´ is, it has ruined many a games.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of unnecessary things being added to this patch at the last minute. The new fishing and cooking dailies will ony be used by a few leveling toons and and by curious 85s.. they are definitely not needed<br />
<br />
The tank goodie bag is not needed. Gear inflation will take care of the tank shortage.. once everyone is in 353s, heroics will be much much easier, which will bring the tank queue back to similar to Wotlk. The easier heroics are, the more people will try tanking them. Also when 4.2 launches and the VP change happens, a lot of tanks will be doing heroics just for the JP that for a few weeks will buy upgrades.... and again, at that point, you will now have everyone in 359 gear, which makes heroics even more faceroll, which means tanking is much much easier.<br />
<br />
Looking for guild tool. Again, a nice feature, but it is not needed now and was only recently added to the PTR. <br />
<br />
They need to get these 2 new heroics out and get Firelands on the PTR so that is released soon. I htink a lot of the angst isn´t with how long these 2 heroics are taking, it is with the uncertainty of how long after 4.1 it will take to get 4.2 out. Once it is on the PTR and is playable, players will be happy to see it could come in June.</div></div><hr />

Personally I'm glad they've been keeping us in limbo about when the first big content patch is gunna drop. The anticipation is what keeps some interest burning, imo. Really would like to see more dungeons in the interims tho - they just get so boring so fast. IDK.</div></div><hr />

U dont quiet understand. It doesnt mean if u quit playing, u quit whole wow scene as whole. Also it doesnt mean that u &quot;care&quot; if u might write something positive/negative about this game's current state. Mostly now though it's a lot of negative comments, especialy if you happen to be a person who is realistic enough and bothers to write something.

I can see following things to see if they've changed/improved enough to get you to resub, but I'm definitely not one of those people. If a game has disappointed me to the point of unsubbing, I'm not going to waste my leisure time following its every move looking for a reason to resub.

While I do not agree with most of what you said, somethings I do. As for the quote above I am currently playing both because I can actually have FUN in Rift. I still LIKE WoW but there is nothing for me to do anymore since I refuse to heal with the game in its current state. I hated BC healing, I started healing in Vanilla and I can say from experience I never wanted to go back to Vanilla but some hardcore idiots wanted the &quot;good ol times&quot; back and ruined the game. I don't care who hated Wrath I actually ENJOYED dungeons because I didn't have to look at them for more than a few minutes. I'm not gonna lie, I hate blizzards dungeons I never ran a single one back in Vanilla because they were long and boring. BC I started because they were shorter but STLL to boring with all the &quot;Trap this, sap that, Sheep this&quot; It slows down the instance and bores me to death. They did away with CC in wrath and while it made it to &quot;Easy&quot; for some made it fast enough I didn't have time to get bored.</div></div><hr />

The artist that made the background (a long time ago) is a well-known artist Greg Martin. What I wonder is why someone used it as a background, put there the WoW toon, and posted it... without even mentioning his name, but leaving the name of the background artist. It's not Greg Martin who did the toon, he's basically more concerned with.. you know, real artwork, as you can probably see from his gallery. <br />
<br />
This is just very weird... ;)<br />
<br />
Yeah, from what I can read from his comments on this image, he says that someone just splattered a mage on top of piece. <br />

He seems rather calm about it, I guess because they left his signature unaltered.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kara is the best Work BLizzard has done in terms of raiding content - IMO ofc. I think they should we should see seperate 10 and 25 man instances again. Not meaning 1 is better than the other - Just diffrent. Same Itemlvl gear - diffrent look but will match if you do both.<br />
<br />
But we all know this will not happen since BLizzard has found a cheap way to &quot;balance&quot; 10 and 25 man junk content.<br />
<br />
Currently playing RIFT atm - game that has ENDLESS possibilites in terms of Raid encounters cause you are not locked down to 1 spec needing special gear. YOu can switch and become a viable healer - tank or dps. WIth ALOT of variety.<br />
<br />
Instead .. BLizzard locked WOW down into forced 31 points trees....</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Honestly that's about the quality of Rift's graphics. It's totally within the capability of a mid-to-high end machine to play a 3-D game at that level of quality. The problem from Blizzard's point of view is that most people who play WoW couldn't play Rift or a similar game reasonably well. I sent a few guildmates a trial code for Rift and we leveled toons together to about ten. One could barely run the game at all (His computer ran it so poorly that we could watch his toon stutter step from our end), the other had to use the lowest settings and regular got graphics skipping even then. Even ignoring for the moment the time and expense required to update all the models and textures to something that looks like the wallpaper image, they'd probably lose half or more of their subscribers if they tried it.</div></div><hr />

To late already in my case.<br />
<br />
Playing RIFT and absolutly loving it - both the openended LVL experince of swapping specs every lvl (if you want to) AND the endgame content. Just fantastic game with mature settings that feel like WOW without flying bunnies. <br />
<br />
RIFT is what WOW should have been in terms of CATA. Blizzard went the other way and hopefully that will keep the kids playing WOW - and more mature ppl playing RIFT. That is at least my experince of the game so far. Got into some great and helpfull groups and absolutly loving it.</div></div><hr />

Agree completely. I was done with Fishing dailes BEFORE cata Launched. And done with cooking dailies for recipes 3 weeks ago. The people who think quests to other cities will make more people stay there rather than SW/ORG are fooling yourselves, people will buy mage portals there and Hearth back. Those Cities are dead and will stay dead.<br />
<br />
By the time this patch goes live I will have enough extra cooking tokens to buy a 200 cooking token hat (IF THEY ADD ONE) , never got around to the dalaran one, cooking dailes outside dalaran took a lot longer to complete.<br />
<br />
So seriously, what the heck is the point of these new cooking and fishing dailies ????????????????</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly people-any numbers that come after the 4 are major patches. 4.0.6 was a minor patch-this one is a major.<br />
<br />
Not every major patch had a Raid attatched to it-that was in Wrath only. They want patches to be less monolitich than Wrath (having everything plus a raid) <br />
<br />
That's what they mean by getting patches out &quot;faster.&quot;<br />

Agree completely. I was done with Fishing dailes BEFORE cata Launched. And done with cooking dailies for recipes 3 weeks ago. The people who think quests to other cities will make more people stay there rather than SW/ORG are fooling yourselves, people will buy mage portals there and Hearth back. Those Cities are dead and will stay dead.<br />
<br />
By the time this patch goes live I will have enough extra cooking tokens to buy a 200 cooking token hat (IF THEY ADD ONE) , never got around to the dalaran one, cooking dailes outside dalaran took a lot longer to complete.<br />
<br />
So seriously, what the heck is the point of these new cooking and fishing dailies ????????????????<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1)It's getting people out of the Org and SW<br />
<br />
2)Incredible benefit for those still training professions via the dailies (Who wants to level fishing, amirite?)<br />
<br />
3) More dailies for alts.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is one of those things you need alts for to really enjoy.</div></div><hr />

It is a minor patch, it might say 4.1 but the content is very little and taking way too long to release.<br />
<br />
If it was completely new dungeon zones i might be more understanding, it's recycled content we've already done with upgraded loot tables.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The devs are too busy playing Rift to find out why people are leaving WoW. They learned they found a better home. It's just time guys. It's just time.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrowNoble</div><div class="date">2011-04-20, 10:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So for the 1st major patch of Cataclysm, they are ... recycling existing content. After the big deal about ZG being removed, they then backpedal and put it back in and call it &quot;new&quot; content? Seriously, with the amount of income they have they can do far better than this. Although I can't say I'm surprised as Blizzard has been recycling content and calling it &quot;new&quot; for years. BC hits and &quot;new&quot; classes available (horde pally, alliance shammy) with &quot;new&quot; heroic dungeons (recycled BC instances). Wrath comes out and a &quot;new&quot; Naxx comes out (recycled vanilla 40 man), more &quot;new&quot; heroics (recycled Wrath instances) and &quot;new&quot; hard mode raids (same dungeon, same models, just different stats).<br />
<br />
It's also sad that major patches are so few and far between. In vanilla, the last patch was 1.12, BC had four and Wrath had only 3. The continuing trend is less content for the subscription buck. Again considering they have vastly higher resources than other companies, WoW should be getting more major patches more often with more content.</div></div><hr />
