When we initially designed and implemented the auction houses, the driving goal was to provide a convenient and secure system for trades. But as we've mentioned on different occasions, it became increasingly clear that despite the benefits of the AH system and the fact that many players around the world use it, it ultimately undermines Diablo's core game play: kill monsters to get cool loot. With that in mind, we want to let everyone know that we've decided to remove the gold and real-money auction house system from Diablo III.<br />
<br />
We feel that this move along with the Loot 2.0 system being developed concurrently with Reaper of Soulsâ„¢ will result in a much more rewarding game experience for our players. <br />
<br />
We're working out the details of how the auction house system will be shut down, but we wanted to share the news as soon as we made the decision in order to give everyone as much advance notice as possible. Please note that the shutdown will occur on March 18, 2014. We will keep everyone informed as we work through this process.<br />
<br />
Josh Mosqueira and I wanted to provide everyone with a little more information behind this decision, so please have a look at the video, and stay tuned to this site for further updates in the months ahead.<br />

<br />
Jokes apart, they realized that AH was basically a system which was going againt the game purpose. Hence the only way to fix it was the removal.<br />
<br />
I appreciate this drastic decision - not only because i've never been a fan of AH, but also because they have taken the courage to turn the game into the right direction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gold AH, lol? So now if you don't have an uber item to trade, you won't be able to trade at all. Diablo 2 works like this, the only reason Diablo 2 works is because Ladders reset the wealth system. Ladders in D3 will help, but Gold will be practically useless. Not really sure how I feel about the GAH being taken away, because now, I cannot log in and play for 60 minutes and spend 10 minutes in the AH, I will have to post on forums, and log in when people are available etc etc to make trades. I would rather have the GAH and have it reset with Ladders.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Auction house helped people to get an honest price on items, it helped to add more variation to items and made it easier to buy/sell/trade whatever you want.<br />

Removing this feature will just send us back to the stone age, help players scam others with overpriced items also let the chinese run over the market.<br />

All I ever did was cheese difficulty by using AH to get a better weapon every 5-10 levels with the best gem available.<br />

With Loot 2.0, the economy will be reset. This is the path I see most people taking unless they do something to prevent it. Will gold no longer be the economy after this happens? My guess is it could be gems or something else. They could also just make gold drops much higher to make it so 100b isn't much gold in the expansion.<br />
<br />
I fully support this as long as they prevent that. Otherwise, people who just buy tons of gold right before the expansion will ultimately be the ones buying everything people want, making trade prices not reasonable for any &quot;legit&quot; players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Git along, little doggies.<br />
<br />
I think the lack of actual revenue from the RMAH coupled with the tremendous feedback from console gamers about &quot;aahhh, this is how D3 was supposed to be&quot; sorta made this a slam dunk.<br />
<br />
I mean, the Console's been out how long before they made this announcement? Not very long at all.<br />
<br />
The data had to be overwhelmingly in this direction for Blizz to close the AH for good considering not only how much work they put into it, but how they delayed the launch, then delayed the AH, then pushed back against the tremendous backlash they received. <br />
<br />
I love this decision. But man alive, when looking at the data, it musta been one of those &quot;cats and dogs agree, even zombies and brains agree...&quot;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jerycho</div><div class="date">2013-09-17, 06:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm actually surprised to see such a drastic approval from the forums for this. I'm just used to seeing so much QQ. Anyway, I think it's the right decision although my gf is currently fuming over it. She buys all her gear which I feel goes against the entire point of the game. I personally haven't been able to access the AH or been able to trade items due to some technical errors on Blizzard's end that they can't figure out so I'm not attached to it in anyway. Game stays the same for me. Grind gear for myself or have nothing at all :)</div></div><hr />

Orrrr just do it the old fashioned way and get loot from drops? Why do people seriously like Pay 2 Win with gold or real world money? I understand competition, but it ruins the uniqueness of item drops. Soooo happy for this update as well as Loot 2.0!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I sure hope that they start giving gear drops as you play that can actually improve your character vs. the 8 - 10 levels below that drops now. While my highest level character could (when lucky) help gear my lower level characters none of them ever got drops at level that they could use or that improved their gear -- that is bad design and necessitated using the auction house to get at level gear that improved a character.</div></div><hr />

P2W ruins the game for everyone else, and it's this intent that certain players indulge in it.<br />
<br />
Hawken is a recent game that suffered from this. It's new update shaved down some of the P2W factor, but it's still there enough that unless you have a max level, fully unlocked mech you are gonna struggle to have fun pubbing matches.</div></div><hr />

I also assume that the gear from RoS will have to be so much better than what we have now so that it makes everyone's bought power from the AH pointless.</div></div><hr />

Why do people seriously like Pay 2 Win with gold or real world money? I understand competition, but it ruins the uniqueness of item drops. Soooo happy for this update as well as Loot 2.0!<br />
<br />
Because the chance to get better loot is related to the existence of the auction house. Thousands of players connected easily via one platform region wide, the personal chance to get useful loots must be down because of the easy access to buy them from the auction house.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's called Loot 2.0. Relax. More of the gear will be focused on your spec meaning that more of the drops will actually be focused on YOU rather than truly random crap. As well, you'll actually have more chance at Legendaries and those Legendaries will rock even harder. <br />
<br />
This change will encourage you to play more because like in D2, you got gear from playing.<br />
<br />
The game is a dungeon crawler. By definition, it's a gear grind. Blizz is easing up on that a fair bit, and adding random Loot Runs and other ways to bust out of the monotony, but if anyone's thinking they can just buy their way to victory, then...no.<br />
<br />
That is a mistake that's been corrected. Without Loot 2.0 and the many other Quality of Life gameplay changes Blizz is implementing, I'd agree with you. Closing the AH with the current loot system would be a disaster. <br />
<br />
That's not what's happening. Frankly, with Loot 2.0, you won't need the AH. Not really. <br />
<br />
The question now becomes what do we do with our gold? I guess I may finally have enough money to upgrade my gems????<br />

Diablo 3 would be released way earlier but thanks to their &quot;activision&quot; interest on making money out of it (with RMAH), the game was delayed and delayed... (and got old even before release)...<br />
<br />
RMAH basically almost killed D3. Guess they want RoS to res the game, so, bye bye AH.<br />

Now on to offline mode, thanks... was really interested in playing the hardcore mode, was mid nighmare dificult when almost lost my character due to a stupid DC... never played it again, not worth as it is.</div></div><hr />

Exactly this. I hate the fact that I require being logged online just to play a solo game. I understood that with the GAH/RMAH, they had to keep your characters on a server and all, but the fact that I can't play without a net connection or just simply play a LAN coop with my wife as she sits 5 feets from me at her desk is fucking irritating.<br />
<br />
Or dying mid fight because of a net hiccup. We deal with that all the time in WoW, but that's an MMO. D3 is not. It's a single player game with coop abilities, it shouldn't be treated as persistently online to play. :mad:<br />

<br />
It succeeded brilliantly at its intended purpose. It just had the minor side effect of killing the game for a large portion of the player base.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is extremely stupid, the AH is incredibly useful for anyone that wants to play the game for more than 15 minutes a week. I don't get why people opposed the AH, except for the idiotic notion that without an AH they could make the drop rate on good items much higher. So now if you want to be competitive you will have to use 3rd party sites/forums for trading?<br />
<br />
<br />
Terrible decision. Oh well, the game was fun while it lasted, but I will not tediously grind my way through inferno on all my chars until I finally have gear that is semi-decent enough to let me play on MP1 and then do it all over again so I can play on MP2 ...<br />
<br />
Diablo 3 is an ARPG. The endgame is the item find. What's the point of playing when you can get a set of gear good enough to breeze through MP10 for a few million gold on the AH? At that point you're already done. With the AH gone, you actually progress through the game by playing it. When you can progress more in 10 minutes on the AH than you can in months of game play, you have a problem.</div></div><hr />

It was a disaster from day 1. It didn't succeed.. At all<br />
<br />
It worked for what blizzard wanted it to work for. Another cash stream at the expense of a good solid game.<br />
<br />
It worked cause it allowed them to give over a million copies of D3 away for free as long as you stayed a WOW subscriber (which many gamers were paying anyway and brought in more money consistently) and still keep cash flowing in by skimming a little off the bottom and top of every RMAH transaction.<br />
<br />
It was successful for blizzard cause it sold millions of copies off it's past iterations but a massive failure for gamers overall.<br />
<br />
I know my family isn't buying the expansion but its good to see the Auction house being removed though, maybe something good will actually come of D3 after all. If only blizzard had listened to gamers complaints about the RMAH from the start and it's negative impact the PR for this game might have been better.<br />
<br />
And as far as getting rid of both the RMAH and the Gold AH, I think both had to go. The RMAh has to go bacause they were designing the game around it and the RMAH was the problem.<br />
<br />
The gold AH had to go cause they actually did revocer from teh AH bug and the massive amount of gold pushed in game.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure about everyone else but it seems gold has little value in game with trillions and trillions floating around. I know my gaming buddies are still sitting on trillions of gold and items from the AH bug that was never confiscated. I imagine blizzard is working pretty hard behind the scene to get things back to a reasonable gold level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
D3 is and arpg in which the main goal is farming mobs to get loot. If you insert in the formula a way to get loot faster without actually playing, here's the main problem with AH. Add to it the fact that getting good loot becomes really hard after a certain treshold (because you need to find very specific stats and roll them the highest possible) then AH becomes the best way to gear a character, which basically kills the game purpose.</div></div><hr />

<br />
can someone give me a synopsis of the problems with the AH?<br />
The loot and game design was balanced around the idea that you had access to the AH and if you got something you didn't want, you could just sell it and buy the piece you did want. Sounds fine on paper but considering the whole point of Diablo is to kill shit and collect gears, it was counterintuitive to make the way you progressed in the game to be playing the AH instead of playing the content. It wasn't as fun and it made loot drops largely a bummer instead of something cool.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zubub</div><div class="date">2013-09-17, 07:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have mixed feelings on this one,<br />
I am overjoyed that Blizzard's is listening to the player base, while putting their own coffers aside.<br />
I am also saddened, as it returns the people who are going to buy equipment and gold to the shady underworld of digital goods trading, with no verified reputable sources. I'd expect to see more and not less spam from b.net friend requests advertising 3rd party gold websites.<br />
I enjoyed making some cash from the RMAH while playing this game in a completely legitimate manner, I am sure it kept me playing longer then I would have had the AHâ€™s not existed in the first place.<br />
The game in its current state feels deeply flawed, and I cannot quite put my finger on anyone specific thing. The full D3 economy seemed to be a wash of massive inflation due to no true gold sinks (BoPs or Cosmetic only items).<br />
I am interested in seeing what Loot 2.0 brings to the table, perhaps it will be enough for me to check out Reaper of Souls.</div></div><hr />

<br />
can someone give me a synopsis of the problems with the AH?<br />
<br />
Diablo is a grindy game. Essentially it's about killing monsters and hopefully drop some awesome loot of of them. The AH provided you access to buy the best gear in the game EXTREMELY rapidly and just faceroll all content and no longer require you to &quot;farm&quot;, leading you to get bored and suffer burnout and no longer play after a few months.</div></div><hr />

I'm glad they're pulling the plug. I've been casually playing found only on both SC/HC sides and having fun with it the last couple of months. <br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to the expansion and think it will do for D3 what LOD did for D2.<br />
<br />
As an aside this also very likely clears away a lot of design issues with Loot 2.0 which can now be set up in a relatively straightforward way without a lot of side stuff from the auction houses to think about.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully they are planning other trading features to take its place, such as the ability to link items and perform trades without joining a game.<br />
Seems like a risky move with a lot of risk of negative reception, especially those who put real money into the AH. Kudos to them for taking a chance on it.<br />

Although, title of this news post could be better worded, as it implies that the AH has already been closed... Actually we have six whole months.</div></div><hr />

Hard to come up with numbers of course but if blizzard had listened to customers, the RMAH would have never made it into the game to start with. The gold AH maybe but not RMAH.<br />

The nail in the coffin was when we all found out drops would be designed around the RMAH.<br />

They've probably determined that by this date, the profitability of the AH won't be worth the upkeep. They obviously aren't making the profit they were making when the game first came out. They are shutting the AH down because of profits, but under the veil of &quot;listening to the players&quot;.<br />
<br />
I hated the AH as much as the next guy, and was a major factor in not only driving me away from the game, but making me not want to come back and play as well.<br />
<br />
That being said, what are players who have billions of gold supposed to do now? I guess with Ladder seasons it won't matter, that gold will be in the Non-Ladder and won't matter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fixed it for you. <br />
The auction house is the entire reason I only play 15 minutes a week. I bought all the best gear with money/gold now I have nothing else to do. Keyruns? Why? It's not any fun when I trash mobs on MP10 with my super leet all bought set of gear. Paragon farming seems like the only thing to do and that is incredibly boring especially when mobs just drop in front of you. With this change, players will be encouraged to get on and actually get their own damn gear to see some real progression, not wait for their birthdays to roll around for that $20 gift card to the auction house.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be fair, they have done it a few times by cancelling/rescheduling games. Eg, just look at Titan, re-scheduled the whole thing, must have cost them an absolute fortune. Same with Lord of the Clans, and Starcraft Ghost.<br />
<br />
On topic though, am kind of happy about this. On one hand, it helped a casual player like me get some better gear to do Inferno with (bought some gear upgrades for a couple of Euros), but ultimately, its far better for the game overall.</div></div><hr />

Completely agree on this that closing the gold auction house (I was never a big fan of the RMAH) is akin to a big win for D2JSP for instance.<br />

I wouldn't mind more account-binding (for instance, you can bind to stash but not trade) but I guess that is a bit of a difference between WoW and D3. Frankly after being a D2 vet, the soulbinding has actually made me gravitate far more to WoW than Diablo.</div></div><hr />

I spent 10 years playing Diablo 2 (mostly) alone, hardly ever traded for any items or gems and still had a blast. What the hell people? I loved not knowing all the sets, all the best possible &quot;in slots&quot; gems and item combos. That's why I played the game for so fucking long. The discovery of new items. New, improved gear. In Diablo 3, that ENTIRE aspect of the game (that niche that made me want to love Diablo as a game and a genre in itself) was simply gone, because of the AH. Oh, you found a new axe? Well, too bad idiot - there's like 5000000 more with better stats than yours, so HA! No variety, no surprises... NO DISCOVERY! The ultimate DEATH of Diablo's gameplay. So, seeing this change, I believe the expansion will bring about a great change for Diablo 3. It will be like the old glory days (LOD) and I can't fucking wait to play it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Loot is the way it is because they wanted people to use the RMAH/GMA they have even admitted to this. Removing the AH and fixing loot is a good thing for those who like playing ARPG's and grinding for those who don't ARPG's are not for you.</div></div><hr />

It's like you are in an abusive domestic relationship and because Blizzard chooses to finally let you go outside, you're grateful.<br />
<br />
When all is said and done, the AH, which completely circumvents the whole reason to even play a loot-crawler, will be live for 21 months --1.75 YEARS! That's a shameful amount of time, and it's disrespectful to the player base who told them it was a terrible idea time and time again prior to launch and even more vehemently for months after. It's like Blizzard's leadership has grown so out of touch with the average player that they think whatever they release, gamers will just go along with it blindly. Then when they fuck up they act at a snail's pace to correct anything that's glaringly broken. The pace of their patches is unfathomably slow, especially for a &quot;AAA&quot; studio. They should feel embarrassed.<br />
<br />
Blizzard claimed that it was a core mechanic that the game couldn't function without, so it looks like this is confirmation that the devs were just lying to us all along. The only reason they are doing a 180 on the auction house is because the amount of people still playing has dropped to embarrassing levels. They could make this change TODAY yet they choose to wait another 6 months to try and milk as much money as they can prior to the Reaper of Souls expansion. They are also just sitting on Loot 2.0 which is being pushed back as a major feature of the expansion rather than releasing it now for free. <br />
<br />
All this and they STILL have no announcement about PVP. What a joke.<br />
<br />
D3 isn't the Diablo that Blizzard needs, it's the Diablo that Blizzard deserves.</div></div><hr />

I spent 10 years playing Diablo 2 (mostly) alone, hardly ever traded for any items or gems and still had a blast. What the hell people? I loved not knowing all the sets, all the best possible &quot;in slots&quot; gems and item combos. That's why I played the game for so fucking long. The discovery of new items. New, improved gear. In Diablo 3, that ENTIRE aspect of the game (that niche that made me want to love Diablo as a game and a genre in itself) was simply gone, because of the AH. Oh, you found a new axe? Well, too bad idiot - there's like 5000000 more with better stats than yours, so HA! No variety, no surprises... NO DISCOVERY! The ultimate DEATH of Diablo's gameplay. So, seeing this change, I believe the expansion will bring about a great change for Diablo 3. It will be like the old glory days (LOD) and I can't fucking wait to play it.<br />
The key words in your post there are &quot;mostly alone&quot;... The reason the AH was a good idea was because of what happened to D2's online community that's now going to happen to D3's. The scamming and RMT made D2 a joke, none of which you personally had to deal with if you played mostly alone. Funnily enough, all that discovery and such you're talking about didn't exist in D2 either, anyone who played online mostly knew everything there was in the game, knew exactly what gear they were shooting for and it was no different in that regard than D3 is now. The difference for you personally is that you weren't part of that community in D2 but because you CHOSE to use the AH you were in D3, you could have just played it exactly the same way you played D2 if you wanted to and would have preserved all that concept of discovery.</div></div><hr />

I mean, I understand where you're coming from cause I was hugely let down at the start, but id wait and see. Just from datamining alone, <br />
<br />
Clans fully featured with ranks/chat/new UI / trade system.<br />
Loot 2.0 system, which actually has game build changing items, if you read through the item list, half the items can change a build completely one way or the other.<br />
Removal of the AH and with better loot comming in after that, it will clean up full bought chars with $$ or huge chars. It's pretty much the old d2 ladder reset with new items comming they just destroy the old ones which could be good for people like you who need fresh start if you have not been playing.<br />
<br />
The new ladder system / Paragon level system with spending points.<br />
<br />
New endless modes of mobs for loot, updated ubers etc..<br />
<br />
<br />
to me it's starting to look like D2 like it shoulda been but better.</div></div><hr />

They are great for profit in the short term but terrible for retaining a player base in the long run.<br />
<br />
For example, someone could spend $50 and get a ton of gear for, say, a WW Wizard build and only have to walk around and spam 3 buttons and lots magically drop. That's not compelling game play.<br />
<br />
In hindsight, they could have made the AH work by doing several things:<br />
<br />
Put a cap on how much someone can post an item for.<br />
<br />
Implement gold caps<br />
<br />
Make gold harder to obtain<br />
<br />
Certain gear sets BoE meaning once you put it on, it can't be traded which leads to less recycling.<br />
<br />
All of these things apply in the WoW economy and on most servers it's as stable as can be.<br />
<br />
TLDR; they should have followed the WoW economy model closer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
sitting here in awe..and shock just like wow, omg and wow over and over. Biggest news event in d3 all year, that is freaking crazy. Never thought that would ever happen and its one of the main reasons i stopped playing because my characters were to weak and the only gear i could find and get was from the AH but i was always to broke to afford anything <br />
<br />
so I'd log i and play and get bored cuz i needed millions of gold for 1 item, and i had 500k saved up took me a whole day, felt worthless grinding all that to be able to afford gear, and i play casually so its not like i can just play day and night like some people can (not jealous, just saying) now everyoen can be on even ground from the start and any gear you find you can be proud of and dont feel like you are competing with 1000's of others, it killed the game for me when i find a legendary and check AH and see 50 of the same thing...makes loot feel worthless<br />
<br />
Now..with 2.0 loot and all the changes with reapers...INSANE! my interest in the expansion just jumped 200% cuz now i feel i can come back prior to expansion and start getting geared and getting some paragon levels, and level my barbarian (i play demon hunter main) and start finding loot, real loot. <br />
<br />
My only thing is now, with the removal not until march 18th of 2014, does that mean reaper of souls will be released on that day or very close after? that would only give them 5 months or so of beta? if beta is announced/released at blizzcon (most likely) or even december, thats 4 months of beta, then removal of AH in march...maybe reapers is coming spring 2014? they are pretty far along, and we know all the new modes thanks to datamining (assuming everything makes the cut in time) so....all i can say is...bring it on....i am ready!<br />

<br />
No it was not a small percentage, it was quite large. In fact, towards the end of the game's life time, I'd say well over 60% of players were buying almost everything from Ebay.<br />
<br />
And what's more, is with Diablo 3, Blizzard has just planted the seed of &quot;Buy my gear&quot; in people's heads. Now people will flock to Ebay and stuff, since they have the notion in their head they can/should just buy their gear.<br />
<br />
But at the end of the day it doesn't really matter if someone else is buying gear or not because unless you're a shallow, retarded twat who actually gets mad when they die in some random Diablo PvP, you shouldn't care at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
It makes more long-term sense to let the &quot;Pay-to-Win&quot; subset of players take the risks that they're already aware of when engaging in such exchanges with seedy third parties than to continue to allow the player base to hemorrhage at the insistence of protecting this subset from itself.<br />

<br />
Pay to win/AH was not the problem, it was the loot system. D2 loot was more reliable...you knew when a wand dropped what the stats would be like. D3 you get not only have a larger variable range within the stats, but the kind of stats that can be on the item vary to much. <br />
<br />
Even after loot 2.0 there is a need for a system to transfer items between two parties. D2 trade chat/games was a terrible way of exchanging items, never made use of third party sites back then. To shady for me. So the need something...it could be an AH or it could be some sort of barter system where you post an item + a list of wants.</div></div><hr />

You are ignoring the fact that the AH had a direct impact on drops. That was the biggest issue. The fact that farming wasn't even worthwhile, and you would almost NEVER get a piece of loot that was an upgrade for your own character. It was all about farming crappy gear to save up for better gear on the AH.<br />
<br />
People will still buy gear, sure. You can't control that. That wasn't really the issue though.</div></div><hr />

This. Pretty sure they would not have closed the AH if it was profitable. $$$$$$ Respect for Blizzard? - dont be fooled...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kurashima</div><div class="date">2013-09-17, 08:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lets be entirely honest here, theyre shutting it down because after the initial cash flowed in from the real money AH, it stopped making any money because nobody was using it. If they had left it as an ingame gold only AH it might have worked. By adding real money, they turned it into a Facebook game, and the longevity on those is pretty short.<br />
<br />
Ill be glad to see the back of it</div></div><hr />

Brofist to Blizzard for finally removing the most cancerous thing they've ever implemented in a game. <br />
<br />
Now.. If they would only unfuck the changes they made to WoW Resilience, we'd be in business!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Auction house helped people to get an honest price on items, it helped to add more variation to items and made it easier to buy/sell/trade whatever you want.<br />
<br />
Removing this feature will just send us back to the stone age, help players scam others with overpriced items also let the chinese run over the market.<br />
<br />
I hope you guys are satisfied.<br />
<br />
I think so too. The Chinese market is to sell gold or items. I'd rather buy from a trusted secure source, but the point is, i'm going to buy no matter what. I'm not going to grind hours on end and waste my life away to afford something I want. <br />
<br />
So this change drives me further away from Diablo.</div></div><hr />

You don't explain other than saying &quot;well looks like i'll be playing again&quot;. To me it sounds like you are sour that people could spend their money on loot and you cant, because you live at home with no job, so you feel at a disadvantage. Which is quiet sad and remind me of little whiny kid bitches</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JimPaladin</div><div class="date">2013-09-17, 08:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are ignoring the fact that the AH had a direct impact on drops. That was the biggest issue. The fact that farming wasn't even worthwhile, and you would almost NEVER get a piece of loot that was an upgrade for your own character. It was all about farming crappy gear to save up for better gear on the AH.<br />
<br />
People will still buy gear, sure. You can't control that. That wasn't really the issue though.<br />
<br />
Actually I'm pretty sure the issue was people buying gear and having better gear than others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No it's not at all. Why does other people's gear even affect you in an entirely PvE game? lol<br />
<br />
People don't want to be FORCED to use an AH instead of playing, so that they can play. It's just a bad design.<br />
<br />
But, you know, believe what you want.</div></div><hr />

The AH did not bother me compared to other issues I had and I am still unlikely to pick up Reaper of Souls unless it is 10 bucks. DIII just did not have the lasting replayability for me along with game play and story being a bit blah. I am a bit spoiled from picking up Borderlands2 for 10 bucks though. Blizzard rarely has sales or price drops until way later.<br />
<br />
From the viewpoint that the AH influenced gear creating a reliance on the AH is something that bothers me and feels underhanded. The gold AH was suitable for my needs so it did not bother me much. Seeing that Blizzard wants to create a better experience with rewards is a good thing.</div></div><hr />

They still have lots of changes to make to even slightly interest me anymore, leveling up felt crappy as often you'd get a skill, try it, ditch it back to normal. no choice, no decision, 95% straight line maps. While stats was a no brainer in diablo 2 after a while, it was hella fun while I was a noob trying to balance em out. Skill build was also pretty fun, just brutal as until later patch you had to reroll.<br />
<br />
so for now, diablo 3 is still not worth to replay ah or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But where will it stand after that? RoS is going to have better gear, making the AH gotten gear (mostly) irrelevant. So I guess thats a wrap, now we can actually play Diablo again assuming Reaper is nicely priced (I'll take it for 30-40, considering I got Diablo for free due to the whole promotional they were doing). Huzzah.<br />
<br />
Now, don't ever do that again, or we will storm whoever was behind that. One screw up is fine, two we are going to have issues... Three+ is EA levels here.</div></div><hr />

Normally they always try to find a way of not saying they were wrong, by implementing another solution, again something that is met by backlash. Anyone not seeing how this is good for the game's future is probably in extreme minority.<br />
<br />
I think we will soon see how mighty Blizzard truly can be in another game, and that will be Blizzcon Wow expansion 5 announcement. Expect something pretty mindblowing. They are on a roll.</div></div><hr />

Great change :D, also I agree with Aeris, this does put a timescale on the release of RoS.<br />
<br />
Which also means, it puts a timescale on next WoW expansion, or rather reinforces the signs of when it will drop:<br />
<br />
Fall 2014.<br />
<br />
Because if RoS comes out in spring 2014, then once again it will serve as a stopgap for WoW players to have something during the long wait for next expansions, just like D3 was when waiting for MoP. Also, there is no way they are releasing both expansions at the same time.<br />
<br />
Of course, this timeline for WoW was completely to be expected, given that wow xpac will not be announced until Blizzcon, and is not in beta yet.</div></div><hr />

i've put about 500-600 hours into D3 now, and that was with AH where i could buy tons of upgrades in no time<br />
<br />
removal of the AH will add soo much more!<br />
will be so much more fun to farm since you will actually find your own upgrades and not just from ah<br />
<br />
<br />
now i'm even more hyped for RoS</div></div><hr />
