Becoming Illidari: A Look at the Demon Hunter<br />
Early access to the new Demon Hunter class will be available starting August 9 to those who have pre-purchased the Legion expansion and have at least one level 70 character on their realm. To help you prepare for your new role as one of the Illidari, we’ve sent scouts into Mardum to learn more about this powerful hero.<br />
<br />
To begin your training, Game Designers Eric Maloof and Graham Berger team up to take you through the features of the Demon Hunter in this class preview video.<br />
<br />
<br />
One of the newest recruits to the Illidari, you’ll begin your journey at level 98 in demon infested Mardum. As you make your way through this dangerous land, you’ll begin to learn the skills of a Demon Hunter, their history, and become proficient in harnessing the power that goes along with your chosen path. Be warned – not every Illidari makes it through. Ask yourself this question —What are you willing to sacrifice to save Azeroth from the Burning Legion?<br />
<br />
Before you make your character, you’ll need to know a little bit more about this hero class. In order to create a Demon Hunter, you’ll need to have at least one level 70 character on your account. You’ll also need to choose between two races within the character creation screen – Night Elf or Blood Elf. To take part in the early access for the Demon Hunter, you’ll also want to purchase (https://eu.battle.net/shop/en/product/world-of-warcraft-legion) the Legion expansion, though everyone who purchases the expansion will gain access when Legion releases on August 30.<br />
<br />
Here are just some of the great abilities you’ll have to look forward to when you embrace the ways of the Illidari:<br />
<br />
As one of the Illidari’s newest recruits, you’ll begin your journey at level 98 on the shattered, demon-infested world of Mardum. As you make your way through this dangerous land, you’ll begin to learn the Demon Hunter’s skills, gain an understanding of their history, and start to become proficient in harnessing the power comes with your chosen path. Be warned—not every Illidari has made it through this trial. Ask yourself this question: What are you willing to sacrifice to save Azeroth from the Burning Legion?<br />
<br />
Before you make your character, you’ll need to know a little bit more about the requirements for unlocking this hero class. In order to create a Demon Hunter, you’ll need to have at least one level 70 character on your realm. You’ll also have the option to choose between two races: Night Elf or Blood Elf. To take part in the early access period for the Demon Hunter, you’ll also want to pre-purchase the Legion expansion. Everyone who purchases the expansion after it launches on August 30 will also gain access to the class.<br />
<br />
Here are just some of the potent abilities you’ll have at your disposal when you embrace the ways of the Illidari:<br />
<br />
Spectral Sight (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/188501-spectral-sight): Demon Hunters’ blindness belies their true powers of perception. They rely on magically augmented sight to detect enemies—even those that hide behind obstacles.<br />
<br />
Metamorphosis: Demon Hunters transform into hellish forms, enhancing their formidable powers. Damage-focused Illidari (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/191427-metamorphosis) gain incredible swiftness and damage allowing them to finish their prey, while those who prize defense (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/187827-metamorphosis) become nigh invincible in their demonic forms.<br />
<br />
Demon Hunters also possess supernatural mobility: They can double-jump, vault in and out of combat, and even glide with their wings unfurled to unexpectedly descend upon their prey and surprise enemies from above.<br />
<br />
Learn even more about the Demon Hunter by watching the Developer Q&amp;A Part 1 (https://youtu.be/5Nfpg5HT9ng?t=42s) and Part 2 (https://youtu.be/2PdvE0ye7AE?t=10m48s) with Senior Game Designer Jonathan LeCraft.<br />
<br />
You are now a little more prepared to be the hero Azeroth needs against the Burning Legion. Good luck on the battlefield—even with such power at your disposal, you’re going to need it.<br />

Warlords Season 3 PvP Disqualifications<br />
As part of our ongoing commitment to maintaining the integrity of Arena and Rated Battleground ladders, we’ve been scouring the ladders regularly for players who engage in win-trading, boosting, and other such harmful activities. Historically, disqualifications have only taken place once a season has concluded, but we’ve been performing these investigations throughout Warlords Season 3.<br />
<br />
As a result, we’ve identified a number of accounts—over 6,000 in total throughout the season—that had engaged in such behavior. These players were explicitly and purposefully disrupting the rated ladders in an attempt to gain or provide other players an unfair advantage and/or rewards that they didn’t deserve. As a result, the accounts that were identified as benefiting from these actions, as well as the accounts of the players who performed them, have been disqualified from earning rewards in Warlords Season 3.<br />
<br />
Among the most recently affected players were some from teams that had qualified for our upcoming Road to BlizzCon 2016 regional tournaments. Following a thorough investigation of these accounts, these players are also disqualified—and as stated in the official tournament rules (NA, EU), these players are now ineligible to continue competing in this year’s Road to BlizzCon. Affected teams will be contacted by Blizzard and allowed to use their one roster swap (if available) to bring in another player so that they can continue competing. Should a team be unable to maintain a roster of at least three players, they will be disqualified and replaced with the runner-up team from the same qualifier cup.<br />
<br />
We are committed to upholding the integrity and competitive nature of our ladders. We’re looking forward to a truly epic Road to BlizzCon, and can’t wait to see how things progress into Regionals and the Legion expansion.</div></div><hr />

About 7 seasons too slow for me. Win trading has been an issue since TBC and is just now being addressed. It's about time though, nothing better than seeing cheaters lose.</div></div><hr />

Pity it is still very much a slap on the wrist. They get no season rewards for this season but otherwise no punishment. I mean if you are not going to get season rewards without cheating and the only punishment for getting caught is to not get rewards then you may as well cheat. If you get caught you haven't lost anything anyway.<br />
<br />
I mean, why not do something meaningful, strip all past PvP rewards and titles from the account and flag the account so it can't get PvP rewards in the future. That would be at least some sort of deterrent assuming they are stopping short of doing anything significant like suspending or banning the account.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am all for this but the problem with DDoS attacks is that they usually originate from botnets and the people in WoW who commit those attacks do actually just &quot;rent&quot; botnets and then spam their target - so for Blizzard there is absolutely no way to know that they are doing this. Yeah, they could monitor if people that are matched again such a person end up getting high packet loss/ latency but even then that is probably not enough evidence for them to take action. Only thing you can do against that is by making sure that you never connect to a TeamSpeak/ any other server (or use Skype) with you real ip. If I ever were to do that, I would use a VPN just for the voice chat.</div></div><hr />

Win-trading and boosting is not cheating or exploiting. They deserve nothing of that you suggest. They're only guilty of disrupting the ladder, not disrupting the game, therefore the only punishment of exile from the ladder they disrupted is logical.</div></div><hr />

They keep nerfing everything else that was too strong (WW and Outlaw this time) and yet DH are still running around murdering everything with seemingly no attention being brought to it.

Timezones got nothing to do with it, they could have scheduled European maintenances on Tuesday, but they chose not to do so for whatever reason.</div></div><hr />

They keep nerfing everything else that was too strong (WW and Outlaw this time) and yet DH are still running around murdering everything with seemingly no attention being brought to it. The fact that Fury of the Illidari still does 100% damage in pvp is a joke when they've already done like 2 or 3 passes of tuning back and forth on other classes.<br />
<br />
I did notice a comment they made a little while back that said since Demon Hunters wont be able to choose any talents until they start to level after Legion, they are planning to increase their damage and stuff to compensate. Its gonna be a helluva ride lol</div></div><hr />

It's not even an actual problem, it's an assinine complaint over something you chose to do. If you wanted the early access, then pre-order digital. IF you chose to not do that then you're not entitled to the early access. The entitlement is unbelievable *shakes head*</div></div><hr />

It really does suck that someone who wants the early access (or even to play the expansion from launch) and also wants the CE goodies has to buy the game twice. It doesn't sound kind of messed up to you that for whatever reason, Blizzard can't authorize/give out early access keys to people who order a physical copy of the game? With the digital version already being vastly more convenient the two things shouldn't really be mutually exclusive. If anything, forking out for the CE should be the one that gives it all seeing as it's the most expensive version of the game.<br />

You chose what &quot;reward&quot; you want, and there isn't an all inclusive package. Do you want early access? Get the digital CE, you get early access and the in-game goodies. Want the physical goodies? Buy the physical and forfeit the early access for some sweet loot. It's not even early access to LEGION, its one class that is gimped till they can level past 100, for 3 weeks. If it was a crack at the xpack itself, sure I might be more on your side. As it stands I got my fill of DH on beta, if you didn't well too bad, pre-order if you so wish.</div></div><hr />

We came within a hair's width of having digital pre-orders get an exclusive Glaive skin, is more the the problem.

<br />
Whatever kind of damage you think you do is kinda irrelevant to be honest. Taking lackluster talents is never a good idea. If you take prepaired there is literally no reason to not also take momentum. Which rules out fel eruption.<br />
<br />
If you didnt take felblade you most likely took bloodlet and are using it as part of your rotation?<br />
<br />
Anyway it leaves you with 1 generator, 2 spenders and 2 cd's to use. (Demons bite, Chaos strike, Blade dance, Throw glave and Chaos Nova)<br />
<br />
Chaos nova being around equal cd time as Eye Beam,<br />
<br />
The only complex part about this spec is having the 15 fury for Blade dance every 7-10 seconds. Everything else is just: Use when not on cd.<br />
<br />
Most likely those talents arent worth takiing anyway :/<br />

Win trading has been an issue since TBC and is just now being addressed. It's about time though, nothing better than seeing cheaters lose.<br />
7 seasons ago they hadn't invested in eSports like they have now. It's definitely late, but pretty welcome - too many people think cheating is a victimless crime, that everyone does it, and that's it's acceptable.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Pity it is still very much a slap on the wrist. They get no season rewards for this season but otherwise no punishment. I mean if you are not going to get season rewards without cheating and the only punishment for getting caught is to not get rewards then you may as well cheat. If you get caught you haven't lost anything anyway.<br />
<br />
I mean, why not do something meaningful, strip all past PvP rewards and titles from the account and flag the account so it can't get PvP rewards in the future. That would be at least some sort of deterrent assuming they are stopping short of doing anything significant like suspending or banning the account.<br />
<br />
They need to be consistent across the board, Battle.net-ise. Overwatch is permanent account closure - why should it be any different for WoW? It should be worse for WoW ranked play, to be honest, or ranked play in Diablo. Cheat in ranked play - you don't get to play anymore, at all.</div></div><hr />

You have to wait until you get into the artifact weapon to see its complexity, like going into demon form every 15-20 seconds because generating extra soul fragments is beneficial with a specific trait, it makes them reduce the cd of eye beam which with the right talent triggers demon form after it is done. It is pretty sweet, and bloodlet + master of the glaive is a great rotational ability and with 2 charges you can snapshot and AOE snapshot. I like it.</div></div><hr />

Nope, Nope, NOPE. They even had a countdown clock for US and EU release of Cata and MoP to show the difference. EU got the expack release at 3am, while it was still 8pm on East Coast. Getting patched 24hrs after US is just a translation and data ship issue. But to think that for competitive guilds, an 8hr advantage is only a &quot;seems&quot; like, or intangible benefit, then you must not be competitive. 8hrs can mean the difference between best in slot pre-raid, or just close enough.</div></div><hr />

Paying gold for boosts is perfectly in line with the Blizzard ToS. Nothing wrong with paying in-game gold for whatever. It's only paying with real-life money that is bannable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does it matter that much that they almost added an extra pre-order bonus at the last minute that has a longer-lasting effect than simple early access when the version of the game that would prevent a player from getting a digital pre-order in the first place is the edition made specifically for players who like to collect things?<br />
<br />
It kinda does, yeah. Gotta nip it in the bud now before it starts becoming the norm. Might be a crappy item model now but in the future it could be a good one, or something even better.</div></div><hr />

Buy a standard edition, than enter CE key and they should refund the standard edition - that is what they did last expansion.</div></div><hr />

Well that's not what they're doing. Their Q&amp;A on the topic, as well as Game Masters and devs on Twitter, have all said what they'll do is 'refund' you a copy of the digital key you initially used, which you can then &quot;give to a friend!&quot;.<br />
<br />
This assumes too much to be useful, particularly if you want cash back, though I'd even settle for Battle.net Balance so I could buy some character services, to be honest. Unfortunately, the system as it currently stands is &quot;buy the game twice and try to fence a Legion digital key after Legion comes out to someone interested in the game who hasn't bought Legion yet and doesn't want the pre-order bonuses&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is in fact, buying the game twice. Who are you going to give this key too? Are you that wealthy you can just buy 1 expansion at the price of two? Who would buy a Legion key from a stranger at blizz retail price? The whole concept is pointless. Especially with Demon Hunter early access, everyone I know already pre-purchased. It's just moneygrabbing greed, even worse than last year.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I got surprised over when pre patch hit, many US players on this very forum didn't believe when I said EU players would get the patch 24 hours after US players - after 11 years of this favorism<br />
<br />
Your right. It's totally favoritism. I mean, why wouldn't they roll out to the EU, you know - since the company HQ is based there - oh wait.....hmmmm.... Funny thing - it's actually NOT based in the EU. It's in Irvine, California? Weird. I don't know how that happened. This is sarcasm, by the way. It's completely aimed at you.</div></div><hr />

I don't PvP much, and this is a weird concept for me. If you're playing against another team, how exactly can they trade for a win and screw you over? I mean, if you just hand them the fight for something in return, how is that screwing you over? I see people say they've been win traded on, clearly as a bad thing. I'm just confused by that. Seems to me that it would be bad for everyone else, but how would you know it was done to you specifically?</div></div><hr />

<br />
In some cases legitimate and honest players miss out on opportunities BECAUSE of these people who manipulate the ladder and engage in unfair/dishonest game play or cheating. In some cases good players have simply quit because the integrity of the game has gotten so bad.<br />
<br />
Kickbotting is a PERFECT example of this... a problem that will continue into Legion. Get into a high enough ranking and it will feel like every other team you play is cheating using these kickbots. But don't you dare start using it yourself because we MIGHT ban you. But good luck increasing your rank without it!<br />
<br />
I know that the argument is made that these players will likely just create a second account. Let them. For some people the risk of losing things they could NOT get back is enough to keep them from doing it.<br />
<br />
But lets say you are a mediocre player, and you probably wouldn't ever get end of season rewards anyway. If you cheat and then are disqualified, you haven't really lost anything. Because had you not cheated you wouldn't have got it anyway. So your &quot;punishment&quot; isn't really a punishment at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I see your hyperbole, well played. The 24hr headstart every tier is meaningless because American guilds simply cannot devote the amount of time needed to keep a prolonged raid marathon like the europeans can. True, we also don't dedicate enough time to alt runs and split runs.. They both play a part. Most americans, from what I can see... aren't taking the time off for expac launches like they used to (like, TBC, wrath, and Cata where people took that day off, and managed to level cap within the day).. this is partially the result of blizz procrastinating the release of raid content. And further to my original post: When the EU gets the expack 8hrs before US, and has 24hrs of gear farming time before their side of the race starts, that means they essentially have an extra 36hrs of gear farming before the actual starts. Server downtime not withstanding.<br />
<br />
TL;DR<br />
The 8hrs advantage isn't the absolute.. it is simply a component that plays a part.</div></div><hr />
