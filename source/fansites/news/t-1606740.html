CASC Conversion in 6.0.2<br />
As previously announced, the Warlords of Draenor 6.0.2 pre-patch marks our transition to the new “Content Addressable Storage Container” (CASC) file format system. This transition is an automatic process that will occur through the Battle.net desktop app as it installs Patch 6.0.2. While it shouldn’t require any action on your part, we have a few notes on the process that can help ensure a smooth install.<br />
<br />
By default your Battle.net desktop app is set to download future patch data automatically. If you’ve turned yours off we recommend re-enabling it to download the 6.0.2 patch data. It’s a pretty big patch, and starting now will save you precious Iron Horde-killing time on Tuesday. Your background download settings are configurable per-game, and you can also adjust things like download speed, among other settings.<br />
<br />
There will be one small final patch on 6.0.2 release-day that will include the last few files to install the patch. Right now we’re expecting it to be around 100MB.<br />
<br />
If you’re one to leave your computer on and Battle.net desktop app running, on the morning of the patch release the install and conversion to CASC will happen automatically.<br />
<br />
Hard drive fragmentation can slow down just about anything you do on your computer, but especially when a program needs to move around large data files, like this patch and conversion process will need to. If you haven’t defragged your hard drive in a while, we recommend looking into it as a possible install-time saving preparation step. Note that defrags aren't typically necessary or recommended if using an SSD.<br />
<br />
If you’re coming back to the game and looking to reinstall from scratch, be aware that all game discs out in the world are printed using the old MPQ file format. That means that if you attempt to install from those discs after 6.0.2, the Battle.net desktop app will instead install by downloading the game. That’s of course not necessarily a bad thing, especially because downloading can actually sometimes be faster than a disc install. Discs being printed for Warlords of Draenor, and for future “Battle Chests”, will be printed in the CASC format and they’ll be able to be used to install from as before.<br />
<br />
If you encounter any problems with the install or conversion please visit our Technical Support forum. For additional troubleshooting instructions or to speak with Blizzard support please use the Battle.net Support site.<br />
<br />
While we've tried to ensure as speedy a conversion as possible by using most of your existing game data, this is a complex process, and depending on your hardware, hard drive fragmentation and free space, among other factors, this still may take a bit of time to complete. We hope some of these hints help cut that down even further.<br />
<br />
Apparently it's not removing the old files, so you're going to use more space.<br />
Not entirely accurate. As the conversion processes each MPQ, it deletes it. At the end of the conversion you should be at or around the same folder size if you've already downloaded all of the 6.0.2 data to this point, and should only need around 4GB free for the conversion itself.<br />
<br />
Something people have noted in testing though is a lack of &quot;garbage collection&quot;, which would cleanup redundant files after new versions are installed. This is an issue mainly in a beta environment as constant (sometimes daily) updates are released and redundant data builds up very quickly, but it isn't something that will immediately result in a larger install upon release of 6.0.2. Implementing garbage collection is something our engineers are working toward.<br />

Level 90 UBRS<br />
There will be an item level restriction to queue for the limited time level 90 UBRS dungeon (http://beta.wowdb.com/items?filter-ilvl-min=550&amp;filter-ilvl-max=550&amp;filter-reqlvl-min=90&amp;filter-reqlvl-max=90&amp;filter-quality=8&amp;filter-slot=2359278), but we're still evaluating exactly what we want that number to be. Note that the dungeon is tuned for players with at least a few pieces of Siege of Orgrimmar LFR gear. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/343980-level-90-ubrs/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/14730503828?page=1#19))<br />
<br />
Patch 6.0.2 Changes<br />
All game-wide systems and content changes being introduced with Warlords are implemented with 6.0.2. That's all class changes, new character models, any end-of-seasons for PvP or Challenge Modes or Brawler's Guild, item squish, the new Premade Groups finder, any tuning or balancing, and pretty much every change that affects the game in a holistic way, all happen next Tuesday. So yeah, it's kiiiiiind of a big deal.<br />
<br />
Oh also there's the pre-expansion event that happens too, so there's also some new content between now and the actual expansion launch.<br />
<br />
What isn't available in 6.0.2, and requires Warlords of Draenor, is walking through the portal and experiencing the actual content of the expansion. Garrisons, dungeons, raids, quests, mounts, etc. etc. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/343785-so-jp-vendors-are-gone-on-october-14th/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/14730503730?page=1#12))<br />

No hyperbole, just want to know why its excusable to be low on numbers as a pure dps class. MM is our only dps-strong option.<br />
On what fight? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/517851769842319360))<br />
On any. Patchwerk specific, it seriously feels like BM/Survival underperforms. Vague but AoE as survival is also not there.<br />
We virtually never make Patchwerk fights; that would be an extremely niche case in practice. Not a fair comparison. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/517852371024506881))<br />

Which abilities do you define as 'Barrier' and 'Block' for monks?<br />
Block would be like Stagger and Purifying Brew (%-based). Barrier would be like Guard and Expel Harm (AP-based). (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/518204795039911937))<br />

EQ buffed (through ECL Perk)? Thought we were going to put more dmg into CL and less into EQ per your post forever ago.<br />
Ele AoE DPS w/o EQ is average. With EQ is amazing. The change is to make sure it's amazing. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/517850794733731840))<br />

PvP<br />
Are we going to be seeing skirmishes in the pre-patch? If so, can we play them in-between seasons?<br />
yes and yes (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/518133935532806144))<br />
<br />
Any news on whether xp-on and off brackets will be merged come WoD?<br />
they will not for the same reasons they have never been merged (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/518146393328738304))<br />
<br />
Make PvPers have their rating achieves reset but keep titles. So there is something to look forward to in WoD, I want to again<br />
understand the desire here. We could definitely provide something cool seasonly here. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/518475717995405313))<br />
<br />
In large scale PvP like Ashran or even AV, ranged seem much better than melee in crossfire scenarios, thoughts/opinons?<br />
Different classes/specs have strengths/weaknesses in different scenarios. We're ok with this. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/518517941231702017))<br />
<br />
Tank specs used to work well in PvP without being OP, in wrath for example they were perfectly viable.<br />
For every person that says &quot;X was perfectly viable/balanced in expansion Y&quot; there's a person that disagrees (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/518518165383675904))<br />
Balance is certainly subjective and usually a matter of perspective. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/518518345931706369))<br />

Telaar post-Warsong quests should be phased to remove the orcs, no? we beat them out of the town<br />
Phasing divides players and prevents you from helping a friend through content you've already completed. We use it sparingly. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/518204552365891584))<br />
There are TONS of places where one could argue for a &quot;problem solved&quot; phase, but we generally don't do them. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/518204694510850048))<br />

New World of Warcraft Comic: Blackhand<br />
A master tactician, Blackhand has never been one to shy away from battle. No matter what enemies the Blackrock orcs face, he has always identified a weakness to take advantage of, and used it to lead his clan to victory. His strength, tenacity, and cunning are legendary among Draenor’s orc warlords.<br />
<br />
But even the best strategists can only do so much when outnumbered and overwhelmed. When ogres attack the Blackrock clan's domain, Blackhand exploits every advantage he can think of and finds he’s still unable to turn the tide of battle. With his warriors pitted against impossible odds, Blackhand has to look for aid in truly unexpected places. Will the price of the Blackrock clan’s survival end up being too high? <br />

Forsaken all of a sudden have high forehead, and receeding hairline. Same for the orcs. This needs fixing, the new hairstyles are horrendous as of right now. And that worries me, because blood elves are having some of the most elaborate hairstyles, and they are already delayed (http://cogitationesastalnaris.blogspot.com/2014/09/the-blood-elves-only-fashionably-late.html).

90% of the players in beta love the new models. If the &quot;community&quot; you're referencing is non beta players, than your sample is irrelevant. Having played all new races in beta, I'm telling you, they are all better than the pics. <br />

Do you think we, as costumers, shouldn't expect a high-quality work? All i want is to every model to look as good and polished as the dwarf does.<br />
The new models look promissing but there's still a lot to fix, and i'm afraid they rushed them and will release them in a poor state.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coconut</div><div class="date">2014-10-11, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I love the work they've done on the models themselves, most of the hairstyles look like hack jobs. With the exception of male dwarves, female humans, some orcs and some of the female undead, they range from major departures from the original to simply horrible. Male humans are the worst offenders here.<br />
<br />
We've got disturbingly bulky hair (male human N.11), flat hair (male human N.12, undead female N.5), hair mesh that doesn't seem properly scaled with the head (male human N.8) or doesn't connect well (undead male N.8), roots texture that doesn't shade properly with the hair mesh (quite visible on human males, especially in contrast with the old models), and even though the mesh has more polygons and higher resolution, the texture seems less detailed (compare human male N.2; the old mesh does a better job at simulating individual strands of hair, both on texture and the top of the cut).<br />
<br />
The Undead hair lost its distinctive features. It used to look dry and matted, with split ends, like it was full of dust and dirt. Now the straw-like appearance is gone, and it looks like the Forsaken are great fans of hair gel. Some hairstyles simply look different (undead female N.8 is combed on the other side). All human beards look different for no apparent reason. It was a simple matter of how those shapes connect to the face, but it appears like no effort was made to keep the original style. Human facial hair N.2, the goatee, goes all the way up to the lower lip on the new version, while the old one only covered half the chin. N.8, the mustache, should have been bushier and reached down to the jaws on the sides, but instead it tries to immortalize Joseph Stalin. They almost look like they were made from memory.<br />
<br />
I hope that, once the entirety of the models are done and they start looking into adding new customization features, the hair styles will be looked at again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah as much as I ususally defend Blizzard, the Orc and Dwarf models are of a much higher standard than the other models. Orc/Dwarf/Gnomes and Tauren look utterly redone and &quot;current gen&quot; (for WoW anyway), the others have only had minor touch ups or texture upscaling. I don't dislike most of them by any means but I don't think they're as good as those three.<br />
<br />
Still don't like the eyelashes on the female orcs though. They're waaaay too glamorous. I mean, can you imagine fem orcs getting up and putting mascara on? Aside from that they look badass though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But seeing the face by face comparisons just show how far off they are from the originals. The undead face isn't even the same shape, let alone same features.<br />
<br />
Human female is just...wow...<br />
<br />
They half-#$$ed it, and while I am glad they are updated, I just can't believe how much same face is going on. I knew it was going to happen with how they handled pandaren, but seriously. Some of the animations aren't even the same? Iconic running man fall for Orc is gone, so if you liked that, too bad!<br />
<br />
Skilled modelers, just piss poor at interpreting the original designs to keep the &quot;spirit&quot; of the character.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are making up very exaggerated numbers. There's been ongoing and consistent feedback from many beta players who don't care at all for the models.<br />
<br />
It's fine if you like them. You don't need to make things up to try to support yourself. Just own your opinion.<br />
<br />
As a beta player, the models are a very mixed bag for me. Human male beards are godawful. I don't care for the continually ditzy-looking female Humans, but I've never liked their look. The new models don't improve them. Female Gnome faces completely negate their former charm. Orcs and Trolls look good, as do Dwarves. Female Tauren are probably the worst of the lot, and are a huge disappointment. Am still trying to decide how I feel about Undead and Night Elves.<br />
<br />
I guess this is the part where I should say that 92% of beta players agree with me. lol.<br />
<br />
Seriously, I think the new models may come as quite a shock for many players. The thing that has been the hardest for me to deal with is the fact that, for some models, nothing I do seems to be able to really bring back the look of the original character I created.

Wod's going to be a masterclass in how the Devs got it so wrong. It was around 13 months after Cata they finally started talking about the mistakes.<br />
the sheer Generic look on the facial expressions alone is just utterly damning how long have they delayed the models? years.<br />
Most human females just look like clones there isn't an excuse apart from one this entire expansion has been half arsed from the start with no real direction<br />
and the abundance or lore they have to work with This was the very best??. fair enough some of the models aren't ready yet but the very least they could do is make sure EACH face looks different.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they don't consider changing animations at least to be similar to old ones, I might quit this game finally after 10 years playing on and off, because my character is my main thing I watch and control when I play, core of gameplay and seeing different animation after 10 years its like playing another race, like halfrace, just NO.<br />
<br />
To people that might reply wiith switch to old models in options, no... I LIKE new models I just hate they changed animations, why, just why touch core animations and something that makes your race and give you the feel to it. Models are looks, animations are feel and spirit of each race you play.</div></div><hr />

I must say that most races at this point have different faces. But the female human, however, as pointed out, is indeed lacking face variation.<br />

This is not entirely correct. They do pay attention to these forums, as it's the biggest(?) fan community besides their own. They have pointed this out personally. They might not read every thread for all I know, but I am pretty certain they catch the most active threads. Zarhym even posted on this forum once, with an account specially made for him, to show it was legit. I am sorry I haven't saved my sources on this, but someone else probably have.<br />

It is there, and it is so much better than on live, where it is a rigid piece that behaves more like a clay mold than hair. But on beta it flows when moving, billows around when spellcasting, and is very fluid overall. I have one myself, and I was very positively surprised.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gonder</div><div class="date">2014-10-11, 09:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think the excessive liveliness of the new running animations will ever really suit my own fancy, can't really think of another way to describe most of those animations other than extremely stupid, even for this &quot;cartoony&quot; game, which is an understandable name to call it though, though honestly, pandas aside, it's lore is just far too dark, and seeing people prancing about like this, in a universe such as this, seems way too over the top. As of far, I've got the biggest gripe with the new human male model. Seriously though, I know a lot of hate got showered down on the original models, and that I can understand, though in my opinion, their bodies were just built to fit almost any piece of armour perfectly, they could look good in just about anything.<br />
<br />
Now though? Well, it doesn't really seem to be the case anymore, because of their general body shape and all, though I personally don't have an issue with that. My issue mostly lies with their appearance in general, the faces and hair and whatnot. So far, the faces haven't been lining up with their originals too well, though most importantly, the hair just looks bad (kind of noticed it's an ongoing issue with a lot of the races, where a lot of the hairstyles are way too flat compared to the originals). <br />
<br />
The biggest example of this on the human male is the soldier cut for the human male. What the effing hell happened there? He looks like he got struck by lightning, before being sucked into a vortex. What the actual fuck, my Marshal Dughan looks like complete rubbish now. Other than that, I'm glad I never grew much of an attachment to the humans in this game, or else I'd be really struggling here (my worgen male's human appearance also seems as though it's going to be ruined).<br />
<br />
Anyway, one other small thing is the fact that an orc, an ORC, has no body hair. Seriously, you think an orc is going to give two shits about looking good on paper? No. I'm sure an orc would rather look like a hairy badass, who would want little more than to go out and kick some sweet ass. So far, and has been the same the entire time, dwarf males have been holding out the best. I've got at least three new dwarven characters planned out for the release of this patch, can't wait.<br />

Use the damn old models if you don't like the new ones.<br />
<br />
<br />
We are now at crunch time, they have no more time to dick around with this stuff or they might as well postpone the launch for another 3 months like they should have set for, given all the people they need to train and get up to speed, yes they would have totally lost some subs, but they stand to loose far more with having thing undone, underdone, or not completely done. So much of this content going through it feels hurried and unfinished, yet they simply have not more time. They need to wrap this up and just live with the consequences of totally unpolished piece of work. <br />
<br />
There are so many thing most people have yet to experience, only a few of the many actually got beta invites the rest had to either read about or watch video feeds of it. Looking and reading about a game you been playing for years, is not the same as actually playing it yourself. So many are going to look way beyond the pretty picture of the content and get a real feel for the first time in a game they won't even remember playing, because in this expansion everything is change, everything. <br />
<br />
Blizzard been getting it from the people that been paying attention for months, wait til the people that have not get in the act. There are going to be threads about everything under the sun that have been discussed until the many the have paid attention are blue in the face. There is a perfect storm about to happen here and when the dust settles Blizzard will be bring out both the change and nerf tools to fix it. Hopefully they manage to get it all nerfed and fixed it a patch or they will see even more leave, that truly want to play it and were extremely excited, only to be truly disappointed at what they had to wait year and half for. It is a ten year old game as many seem to want to concentrate on, but they have a ton of people still play this game and/or want to come back after a very long time. Some are simply not going to be able to adjust to this current model other that just raid, will just go about the usual stuff and not even worry about the rest. <br />
<br />
The majority though that don't raid at all, will be the focal point here as to how warm and fuzzy this content is going to feel to them and they might be able to overlook a few things likes scrapping professions, making the garrison feel like you are actually doing daily rep grind quest in 5.0 content, with it slow bleed way of leveling. These models are but the tip of the ice burg, wait till we get to the actual expansion, that is going to be some very fun reading material.</div></div><hr />

Model updates are one of the major improvements and features of the next major expansion so why is it that so many people should have to use old models and not enjoy the new ones, simply because the new ones look so drastically different for certain races?<br />
<br />
Frankly, to me, it's a promise not kept.</div></div><hr />

blizzard probably has some of the best artists in the industry when it comes to digital design of characters, so I'd like to know where they could hire these mysteriously awesome designers from to do a better job <br />
<br />
Models are going to look &quot;different&quot; because of how many more polygons they are using now, people like you will never be satisfied with model changes.</div></div><hr />

still... my dwarf females will never have same spirit... enough to say I have one &quot;old styled&quot; character, which old looking face is huge part of, and that old looking face is just done VERY BADLY comparing to the original one :(</div></div><hr />

You seem to believe that the art team has full leeway on whatever they want to do. Its not.<br />
<br />
They could very well be highly talented, they are not the ones that decide when to release the expansion, how much work to do and the orientation of the game.</div></div><hr />

the heck are you talking about, I don't believe whatever words you are trying to put in my mouth<br />
<br />
the other person is complaining that blizzard artists are incompetent because they do not like the character models essentially. Which is ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

They are all twins! The differences between them are so small and they barely resembles their original face! What's up with that! I respect all the hours given here but as a female gamer I really care for my characters look and right now the faces of the female human and also night elf looks so strange, its like a new game, where did WoW go? There is no variety part from wrinkles, lip color and eye color! What the heck!<br />
<br />
I would rather have a wider variation of the beautiful faces than the goofy emotes. :( *cries in a corner*<br />
<br />
I gues i will have to make my druid into a male worgen or something! Bwah! :(<br />

This was the first time I've seen all the faces side by side. Is it just me or do all the new Human Female faces look almost identical? Comparing them with the originals, I'm left scratching my head wondering who in their right mind thought these new models did the originals justice? <br />
<br />
Armature community modders could do 1000 times better than these highly paid Blizzard employees. Just visit the Skyrim nexus if you don't believe me.<br />

I know right? People make such a big fuss about a graphic update on an already technically outdated game.<br />
<br />
The good thing would have been to add some innovative content or maybe just update the environment of WoW. Face it,you are going to look at your character face for some days,maybe a week and then it will be forgotten. Thats a really short-sighted type of content. <br />
<br />
Next expansion: &quot;duh guys we going to add some fish animations in the water areas rejoice it will be 50% of the content!&quot;</div></div><hr />

They used to be well groomed and smooth and now they are all messy and dirty looking. They cleaned up orc hairstyles when people complained that they didn't like the messy look (even though an orc should look messy and dirty) but not the humans. And the poor soldier hairstyle when from a short practical haircut to Frankenstein's monster, it looks ridiculous<br />
<br />
I like pretty much everything about all the updated models, most races look great like Tauren, Dwarfs, and Trolls. But for male humans they waited way too long to reveal them and then I guess couldn't listen to feedback because it was too late to make changes, or they just didn't care enough to. Faces are one thing, I wouldn't be so upset if I didn't like my character's new face since I rarely see it, but I see my hair all the time since I never show helms, so it's really frustrating that hairstyles I once liked look terrible, and so do most of the others</div></div><hr />

When it comes to undead male, the face doesn't really fit the body very well (face is too broad), and it's really lacking in choice. And the female model lost most of what made me like the old model. The new face on the undead female model is a bit weird, sort of a angry evil witch look – and movement, running and jumping animations lost the uniqueness it had.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skylia</div><div class="date">2014-10-12, 07:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Tauren Female faces are just so upsetting, they have cat/bear noses, that is not a cow nose :( and the black coat texture is now grey and her open-mouth idle is just...derpy. Half of these models feel unfinished, I can't believe Blizzard is letting this go live...I would much prefer it if they delayed the races that they thought weren't done (which is most of them). My Night Elf's face now has a smile, what? The Human Females look even more dopey than their old models. If they butcher Blood Elf Female faces like they have butchered many of these I am going to be furious.<br />
<br />
I'm not one to complain much, I DO love a lot of things about the new models but there are so many things wrong with the faces (and some of the animations) that it feels rushed as heck. Maybe we will see fixes in upcoming patches...I sure effing hope so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you actually looked at the Idle animation on an undead male WEARING GEAR on the ptr or beta? <br />
You can harldy see the motion sickening Idle animation from the shoulders when he is nacked...but on my geared mage, the difference in animation is HUGE!</div></div><hr />

Ok, ok. That's great that they added TONS more detail to the characters. They are very detailed. The art staff did what they were told to do.<br />
<br />
But would it have killed them to add a few more options?!?!?! What the hell? Is no one on the art staff possessing a single iota of creativity? And how about some smaller noses? All the human dudes in the game look like they are about to pitch face-first into the dirt from being so off balanced.</div></div><hr />

Besides some faces having NOTHING TO DO with the current ones there is also the weird face expressions they put. They tried too hard and in the end it looks like a weird pixar/disney character.<br />

Ugh just saw the male undead faces too. Some are completely diferent from the old ones. The &quot;soulblighter&quot; look alike face now looks like he had poop spread over his face. Come on.<br />
<br />
In short both my male and female undeads would end up totally diferent from what they used to be. Pure nonsense.:mad:</div></div><hr />
