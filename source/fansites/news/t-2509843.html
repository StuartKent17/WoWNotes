tbf, they are just realistic that the launchspike won't last forever and by having minimum amount of realms, you lessen the chance of having a bunch of ghost towns.</div></div><hr />

I don't buy that argument for a second. <br />
If realms really stagnated, they could easily offer free transfers, kind of like they're doing RIGHT NOW. <br />
They decided to try save a few bucks at the expense of the players. They shouldn't get a pass for that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They have never in the past 15 years given free transfer to leave a low pop realm.<br />
<br />
If they didn't limit the realms, you'd be bitching how blizzard tries to dig your wallet for that transfer money out of your dead realm.</div></div><hr />

What about PVE?<br />
i know a lot of BR's who wants to play on the new server too and they dont want to leave their characters in other realms like westfall and such<br />
<br />
Also... this shit is going to be Hosted in Chicago as all other Latin American and Brazillian servers, since blizzard has money to make yearly blizzcons, but to not buy or even rent 2 Datacenters in Brazil so players doesn't suffer with 114+ MS every single time.</div></div><hr />

I have buddies on other realms but they aren't on the list of options. <br />
<br />
I would also caution against moving. I did it once back in the day and it was terrible. Few people end up transferring and those that do get the shaft on a dead server while you are just removing the queue for those that stay in the process. I think it's been said before but I'm just reiterating it. <br />
<br />
I'm on whitemane and we pretty much have a 4-5k queue every single night without fail. I've never actually seen it dip from there since launch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, there aren't really nearly 250 realms anymore. Connected realms makes the functional number of servers closer to 100 or so (between 2 and 6 servers are connected).<br />
<br />
Connected realms do pretty much everything you would expect merges to do...except that Blizz doesn't have to deal with forcing people to change names.</div></div><hr />

Nah dude, there won’t be any drop off. Classic will be just as popular six months to a year from now as it was when it launched because I like it. And since I like it and I’m the center of the known universe, I refuse to accept anybody with an opinion different than my own exists.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And that is any different from your attitude how?<br />
<br />
I was told by very serious people with their superior opinions that people would stop playing Classic after a few hours once they realized how boring the game is.<br />
<br />
Then I was told by very serious people with their superior opinions that people would stop playing Classic after a week or two once they realized how boring the game is.<br />
<br />
We are approaching a month with no slow down.<br />
<br />
Not saying that there won't be a drop off, but it didn't happen nearly as fast as most nay-sayers said it would, nor as fast as Blizz strongly implied by their words and actions.<br />
<br />
I'm waiting for the next revised date by those very serious people with their superior opinions. In the meantime, it may be worth considering that Classic may very well just hum along at a steady clip for a good many months. Classic may even grow slightly. The people that held your opinions have already been proven wrong, so why are you assuming that they will be right in their next prediction, or the one after that, or the one after that....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, and the free transfers aren't working. They had the right strategy, they just didn't execute. It has nothing to do with them trying to save money, and everything to do with them trying to minimize dead servers without having to merge servers at a later date.<br />
<br />
And they're not getting a pass. They fucked up with their estimations. More people are playing than they thought, and the drop-off isn't happening as fast as they thought.</div></div><hr />

Lol, the servers themselves cost next to nothing to spin, it's not hard to see why they would rather make sure there will be enough players to sustain long term play than have dead servers 3 months from launch.</div></div><hr />

So much this. Just image how much of this mess couldve been avoided by having 30 servers to preregister names instead of the original 13 they released.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So completely tank a server's population later instead of fixing it the right way first?<br />
<br />
If they had made a few Brazilian realms off the bat, this wouldn't even be a problem. Instead a portion of the US players transferred off so now the remaining US players will go from either a High pop realm with a mostly Brazilian playerbase to a medium mix of the two cultures or worse a low pop realm. <br />
<br />
I don't mind the Brazilian players who attempt to speak English when I explain I do not speak the language. I've seen both sides get very hostile about it though. I asked if a group could speak English since I don't know Portuguese and they responded with I should learn their language. I said that it is a US server and that he already speaks English. Told him it would be a lot easier for him, being bilingual, to speak in his mostly fluent English over me not knowing a single word in Portuguese trying to communicate. He was offended until I explained to him that I was not saying it as some sort of bash on him speaking his language, but it would make things go a lot smoother since I don't know the language. The other side of the coin is the disgusting racist Americans saying pretty terrible things in trade/lfg when someone isn't speaking English. Yikes.<br />

<br />
Why would I leave Thalnos? Did you read what I even wrote? <br />
<br />
We lost a large population from Americans angry that Brazilians rolled there on the first transfer. They will be opening transfers from Thalnos to a new Brazilian server. By doing so, the population on Thalnos will again take a hit. Our queue is ~600-1000 people. A 10 minute wait at tops, which I think is at a good spot. I get a long with the Brazilians and even have one who I met while questing who quit his Brazilian guild (one of the bigger ones on the server) to join my guild of friends.<br />
<br />
I am at work and happened to be on break when that popped up. I am in no way a &quot;no-life poster&quot; and I sure as hell wasn't aiming to be the first post because I don't care about that. Maybe you should reflect on yourself before you judge someone else?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nobody its going to transfer to this new realms unless there is a better &quot;server&quot; service for South America, you see, probably 60% of the Latin America and the entire Brazil are playing from 150 ping to 230 ping on retail. On classic some people are having from 180 to the 290. SO moving to an entire new server with the same quality of life it will not appeal. <br />
<br />
Hek even people from the Latin America groups are saying &quot;yeeey finally blizzard will give us better ping&quot; and i am like... dude its a realm not a server stop being *****s.<br />

On classic some people are having from 180 to the 290. SO moving to an entire new server with the same quality of life it will not appeal. <br />

I'm not talking about the new brazilian server dude. I'm brazilian and do not want to play with other brazilians. I'm talking about layers and how blizz cannot remove them on big realms without causing massive problems.</div></div><hr />

Because they are expecting people to move thats why and it will not happen if there is no better quality. Big population its tied to Layers and tied to comodity. I bet you if blizzard launchs a South American server with the realms in that server, Thalnos, Faerlina and Herod are going to drop in queues. Thats why.<br />

FOr some fucking reason the Hall of Fame of Latin America want to fight big streamers... and all the followers are going to those servers xd</div></div><hr />
