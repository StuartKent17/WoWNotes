Admiral Taylor's Greatsword<br />
Has anyone heard anything on if this sword is going to be moggable in upcoming patch or not yet? I'm still hoping it will be, but I can't play the PTR to find out.<br />
Admiral Taylor's Greatsword (http://www.wowdb.com/items/118080-admiral-taylors-greatsword) will be eligible for transmogrification in an upcoming 6.2 PTR build. To keep things fair, there will also be a Horde equivalent (in a different color) as a treasure that could be found in the Jungles of Tanaan.<br />
<br />

<br />
awesome now give me back the sword I vendored!~<br />
If the item has been misplaced in the time since it was originally obtained, there will be an in-game way for players to obtain the sword again.<br />
<br />
Will it be like the vendors in pandaria?<br />
It will likely be a vendor. Details are still TBD at this stage. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/369696-admiral-taylors-greatsword/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/17085899084?page=5#81))<br />

Tyrande's Slience<br />
Finding the outcry over changing the name of an unreleased ship a little silly. Nothing is lost by changing it. No reason at all to keep it. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/590913398793109504))<br />
When our options are &quot;upset some people&quot; or &quot;don't upset some people&quot; with literally no other factors that's an easy decision. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/590939223739490304))<br />
I think it's far more silly that you actually listen to the &quot;outcry&quot; of people complaining about the ship's name to begin with...<br />
So you're offended that we don't want to offend people? I don't think we can help you. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/590914448803500032))<br />
There are TONS of things that could be considered more offensive in the game, but everyone knows its only a game. <br />
Eh, this change hurts nothing, makes some people happier, and took *maybe* 2 minutes to do. Pretty straightforward IMO. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/590937562690248704))<br />
stick to your guns for once<br />
Offending people for no reason is not a &quot;gun&quot; we'd like to &quot;stick to,&quot; sorry. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/590697042730741760))<br />
Meanwhile, if you ignore them as any sane person should, you make sure that they don't have power.<br />
We're talking about a 2-minute change, here, not the FUTURE OF WORLD OF WARCRAFT or any such silliness. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/590971721655701505))<br />
I'd imagine it's more of a perceived lack of integrity and / or caving to people inventing insults where non exist.<br />
I don't get how sticking to our goal of making our game accessible to everyone is a &quot;lack of integrity.&quot; (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/590971964753317892))<br />

Raid Finder<br />
That's good to know. I know LFR isn't popular but I like it just to see that end content.<br />
It's pretty popular (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/587871805693493249))<br />
Well, that's good to know too. I suppose I meant.. 'not popular' in regards to the people who easily rage in it.<br />
Curbing toxic behavior is an interesting topic. Open to discussion for improvements. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/587872291972747264))<br />

What would you like to see improved? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/587873457385275392))<br />
give people the chance to *learn* things, not a blind Zerg.<br />
Challenge: every time the group wipes, someone gets really super mad, verbally. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/587874186044911618))<br />
Then let them be mad and ragequit. Why cater to those who don't want a challenge?<br />
Has a negative effect on existing players, can cause a chain reaction. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/587875894200401920))<br />
Then reward and promote good behaviour.<br />
How? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/587876507646738432))<br />
You could peak at league of legends - they are making a player reward system I think.<br />

Are Seals of Tempered Fate remaining the Bonus Roll currency? Does that mean we can stockpile them before HFC opens?<br />

If the last 10 years are any indicator we know one thing for sure about 6.2 wont be involved. <br />
Mekkatorque was in SoO, what makes you think he isn't interested in the future of Azeroth? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/587875520680857600))<br />

so glad to see Hogs found a home in-game! One small request. Could we see Hogs get a new model, rather than a shrunken Hogger?<br />
Hogger is hogger man! That's like asking my cat not to have a tiny head. He can't help it. And it's cute. It's really tiny! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/587862029349687297))<br />

Nothing the damage is done. Just don't put one in the next expac please<br />
&quot;Just don't&quot; is not entirely convincing feedback. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/587846525604204545))<br />
ok how about if you've done it once(account wide) khadgar can teleport you past the quest chain but you sacrifice the exp?<br />

Potentially interesting topic: how do you feel when you die in the outdoor world? Do you ever? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/587874888561459201))<br />
I actually really hate dying in the outdoor world LOL. Fine with it in raiding though as it happens.<br />
What if the area you're entering is elite, but you know there's a rare leveling weapon there? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/587875308226777088))<br />
I love a challenge - and feel so sorry for how over simplistic the game has turned, in terms of levelling, talents, buttons etc.<br />
Several things in WoD posed a challenge for me, mostly Wanted targets/leveling elites. I liked that. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/587876382136344577))<br />
<br />
One piece of feedback i'd like to give on the current boss models is Archimonde is very underwhelming as he currently is<br />
Often find that the fight makes the visual impact. E.g. Lei Shen. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/587877352555749378))<br />

They'll get right on that, right after more alliance weapon models are usable by Horde... like all the lvl 60 pvp weaps :p</div></div><hr />

Honestly? Good. This is a progression based game, and skipping to the end is not rewarding. There is a new garrison-based catch up mechanic in 6.2 for alts.<br />
<br />

Yes, like before when we didn't have re-roll coins. Or followers to raid for us. <br />
<br />
Garrison is catch-up mechanism and re-roll coins is for upping chances a bit. If you had 10 coins from day 1 you would re-roll on everything in the beginning and gear up exactly twice as fast in first weeks. That way blizzard would balance around the coins and it would just be bad for those who didn't have 10 stacked.</div></div><hr />

If they keep the costs for the shipyard in check, it's the best solution. The current costs for the ship yard and the ships are over the top considering the naval missions will award 640 catch-up gear and that ships can be destroyed if they fail a mission.<br />
<br />
Starting with new followers in the form of ships is better than continuing with the current ones. Simply increasing item level for followers makes it a non issue for anyone that stocks up on tokens to make all their followers hit the cap the moment the patch hits. You should not be able to stock up for a new patch. And new seals was pretty much a given. Every MoP tier had it's own seal.</div></div><hr />

The cost of the shipyard was changed to 150 resources on the PTR - the cost in the final release isn't known right now. Hard to make any judgements until they release the final cost.</div></div><hr />

I think Farahlon will come in like 6.3. Or maybe the final patch of the expansion with it being similar to timeless isle. There have been several hints about it through quests, missions, and a few NPC quotes.</div></div><hr />

You realize that Tyrande's Silence was a pretty badass name for a boat right? Silence is power more so than noise is power sometimes. Tyrande's Silence is just as easily seen as silencing the enemy, which was my first thought through destruction, and I thought it was badass. But seeing it as some sort of women should be quiet shit is pretty foolish and hunting something to call misogynist. Instead of battling actual misogyny. Lore's answers were pretty poor anyways and basically danced the questions. I get its an easy fix, but instead of proving they aren't misogynists they changed the name basically admitting it was misogynist. Correcting something only means you were wrong to begin with. There was no wrong here and was merely an example of coming to a conclusion then making facts fit your conclusion instead of objectively looking at the issue. Should no female players have silence as a spell so that it can never be refereed to as Female Player's Silence and misused? While we are at it lets take away swords they look too much like dicks and just fit into the power structure that dicks are powerful and vaginas are weak. <br />

I get it doesn't make a difference what the name of an imaginary ship is, but its moments like this that I wonder if people who feel they are fighting for equality realize that this isn't the right battle and is hurting a cause that has an actual place in the world. People should be equal, but sometimes you aren't doing yourself a favor by looking for anything that could be construed to be offensive despite all context. CONTEXT fuckers learn about it. Context like grammer are the difference between &quot;Helping uncle Jack off a horse and helping uncle jack-off a horse&quot; make sense now? If Jack is sitting on that horse we can pretty safely assume he wants down from the horse despite the grammar. Just like if Jack is under the horse grabbing at its dick we can assume the latter. Because of Context clues.</div></div><hr />

It's more like everyones' head-canon Tyrande is a lot different from actual Tyrande.
