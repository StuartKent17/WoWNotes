Seeing the Tier 17 sets really makes me wish there was a dye system in WoW. Probably not a full blown one where you can die every single bit of armor any way you like, but one where you could choose out of a lot of different color schemes, maybe? A lot of the Tier 17 stuff would look really good to me with different colors. I barely like any of the color combinations they're using this time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No it's an Arrakoa Golem. Blood Elves don't really have a place in Draenor as far as i can see. The lore currently is that before outlands, the Arrakoa were a very stuck-up, noble and proud race, worshiping their sun god and harnessing the powers of the sun to smite any interlopers from their tall spires in Arakk.<br />
<br />
They are probably going to have alot of solar-related imagery/architecture and lots of ornate, golden stuff such as that glorious looking dagger.</div></div><hr />

I also noticed down in the corner that there's a piece of map whose shape reminds me of the mini map around Garadar. Placeholder for the other continent, I guess.</div></div><hr />

Well, the blade of it anyway. So, so similar to it and what with Diablo being another Blizzard IP it seems like an intentional nod to it.<br />

You can see it sometimes when the hair or helm bugs out for some reason and your character appears &quot;bald&quot; but with a flat hair texture on their heads. That texture is the hair we see above. it acts as a base and as a &quot;hair under the helm&quot; effect for the helms which show a bit of hair in bits and corners.<br />

The whole race is called Eredar. Draenei means exiled in their language. They are true Eredar, those who serve the BL have been corrupted. If most of the race agreed to serve the Legion why not few more? Also 'twisted' - they might as well be all called Reek.</div></div><hr />

They are draenai traitors. The Eredar who chose to join the legion when sargaras came are Manari. The Eredar who chose not to are the Draenai.<br />

These are Draenai who have since betrayed their good bethren and joined guldans forces. But that does not make them Manari.</div></div><hr />

I think it has to do with my strong reaction to Tier 10 and this feels like a re-hash of that. When Tier 10 came out, I hated it but shrugged it off, but to see them go back to a similar look is aggravating, because it just does not fit the class.</div></div><hr />

TBH the last time I can remember ever needing that spell in a raid was the drake trash in DS, and even then it was only the short duration I was running lfr. We will live on without it just fine. Pet growl will cover most of the relatively rare situations a hunter needs to taunt anyway.</div></div><hr />

Oh boy, what Bullshit is this going to be?!<br />
Draenei that service the Legion are called Eredar.<br />
<br />
Adding on to what others have already said, have you even once considered that the Sargerai is the name of a faction and not an entire race? Judging by the name and explanation, they are probably Sargeras' personal pawns who follow and serve him alot more specifically than other Eredar/Shadow Council members.<br />
<br />
It's no different than demons under service of Illidan are still called demons, but a hand full of them are also part of the Illidari council. Calm down dude.</div></div><hr />

They basically said for WoD that our HP/and DMG would get squished but look at the details of it.<br />
1. HP-once squished both player and creature(enemy) HP doubles keeping them essentially even to each other<br />
2. DMG Creature(enemy NPC) DOUBLES, where has player dmg not only doesnt but we actually do less looking at the ability drops in dmg percentage and also PLAYER CD's get lowered but not enemy NPC's CD's.<br />
SO BLIZZARD IS LYING WHEN THEY SAY WE WILL DO THE SAME DMG AS BEFORE BUT EQUALY SQUISHED and no one wants to call them on it I have had multiple post on Blizz's sight ignored or deleted when i ask so now i am goiong as big as possible please post on other sites. The only answer I have come up with is that BASELINE has been replaced with SCALING. But I for one actually want to see this equation.</div></div><hr />

Alpha. It's Alpha. It is Alpha. Alpha it be. Alpha, not beta, not release, Alpha. <br />
<br />
also you did not ask a question. big or not.<br />

Nothing here is reflective of the actual product and is only part of the numbers calculations and testing for final equilibrium which is a step that is miles away. <br />

He means lore wise. The blood elves took the Anima Golem technology from the thunder kings fortress (alliance side, Jaina got the Thunder King's power imbued into a staff) and indicated they are going to integrate it into their own and experiment with it for other purposes.<br />
<br />
That construct is either a blood elf anima golem or a magic imbued Arakoa golem.</div></div><hr />

Actually it is more like me complaining because the chef is using rotten vegetables to make the soup as this info was released prior to Alpha and with alpha is not getting any better player damage is getting lower not fixed meaning they know its wrong and are making it worse so lets say I have an atk that does 200% weapon dmg now but when alpha was about to release it is now only 150% and now 3 weeks later they change it again to only 100% but enemy NPC dmg to player goes in reverse then by the time the game release we will have gone from 200% to 20%. Also I realize why they are doing this is to &quot;persuade&quot; us to be more team involved and less solo they have even talked about trying to be more group friendly which is why they are making normal and heroics like flex which I do like but I would still like to be able to solo some content. And before you say anything another indicator is your followers specials that will also help you in combat in certain situations having a brawler from your arena assist you for a minute or medic but some people dont want to deal with the garrisons. And less we not forget the alpha/beta of MoP and we all saw how that turnrd out, Oh wait minus 2 million subs.<br />

<br />
please pay closer attention I am not concerned with 1 shotting an enemy npc, I AM concerned with them 1` shotting us. Essentially what they have been saying for the past month or so when they released the squish info is that PLAYER health and CREATURE health will not change just appear lower in number that is fine, but they also said that they were DOUBLING CREATURE DMG TO PLAYER but if you look at all the notes all of the player dmg in response is cut down (230% weapon dmg DOWN TO 130%) and so on through all classes, as well as making tanks be more healer dependent. Meaning if it took 5 hits for the PLAYER to kill the CREATURE it will now take almost 10, However if it took 10 hits for the CREATURE to kill the PLAYER before it will now take only 5. This is what i am talking about not 1 shotting them I am fine with the current damge we do now, hell i wouldnt even care(if they were honest and upfront about it) if they still had the Player reduction of DMG to the CREATURES but to further hinder us they are also DOUBLING CREATURE DMG.</div></div><hr />
