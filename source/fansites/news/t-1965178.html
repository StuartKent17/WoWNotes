Patch 6.2.3 Hotfixes - March 15<br />
Achievements<br />
<br />
Fledgling Hero of Warcraft (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/10657-fledgling-hero-of-warcraft): Fixed an issue where characters that reach level 20 while inside of an instance were not receiving credit for the achievement.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Posts<br />
Hearthstone Promo<br />
1st: is the achievement in the game yet?<br />
2nd: Do I need to level a character to 20 or can I get the achievement on this character ?<br />
3rd: Does the character have to be a newly made character?<br />
<br />
1. Yes<br />
2. You need to level a character to level 20. The achievement isn't retroactive.<br />
3. No, if you have an old character around that's lower than level 20, you can simply level that one. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/405078-questions-on-the-hearthstone-promo/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/17610911383?page=1#17))<br />

Powershift Macro doesn't work. &quot;/cast !Cat Form&quot; does nothing. On Live I can shift out and shift in back instantly.<br />
We've added a cooldown on reentering a shapeshift form you just left. It's not a GCD, though, (1/2) (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/705945001327357952))<br />

Is the health and damage supposed to be so high? I really hope it'll get squished down to a reasonable amount.<br />
Tuning is still ongoing, but the overall increase to health pools is intentional. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/705953045834674177))<br />

<br />
The daggers for assassination actually look quite nice, and they're sheathed on your back. Pretty bad-ass imo. I do agree with the dog teeth comment however (sub's artifacts). <br />
<br />
I also think blizz takes pot shots at rogue players here and there too. For example, I'm playing alpha on my assassination rogue and I exit the class hall. I stop and look up to notice I'm standing in the &quot;whine and cheese&quot; shop. Lol, made me laugh so hard.</div></div><hr />

And I haven't even touched it. It's kind of like their storytelling: amazing from afar, i.e. Chronicle, but absolute dogshit in implementation, i.e. nearly all storytelling in WoW. They're like that douche who calls himself an &quot;ideas man&quot; as an excuse for being utterly useless at actually doing anything.<br />
<br />
Man, this is coming across as unnecessarily bitter. But maybe I am. Resubbed less than a month ago and already have the login fatigue: log in, immediately bored, alt-tab or log out. I'm sure a big factor is my server; being Tichondrius, it's all PVP all the time with maybe one or two mythic guilds spamming in Trade, and I'm pretty much fucking done with even giving WoW PVP the benefit of the doubt anymore. Played vanilla for a year, did MC and BWL progression, so I just want to like, do normals, but the social fabric of the game is frayed beyond repair due to Blizzard's capitulating design choices since Wrath. Ugh. This got way longer than I intended.</div></div><hr />
