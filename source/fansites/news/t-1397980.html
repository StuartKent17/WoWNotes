Blizzcon Dev Interview Recap<br />
Gamebreaker (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVYZqrlsO-0) had the chance to talk to Ghostcrawler before Blizzcon, so this entire interview looks back at Mists of Pandaria. <br />
<br />
PvE<br />
<br />
Raid Finder is finally in a decent place, but there is always room for improvement. <br />
Flex hasn't had a huge impact on the number of people using Raid Finder. <br />
The drop in the number of tanks in Raid Finder is partially due to how they are treated. (If you want faster queues, be nice to your tanks!)<br />
<br />
<br />
Proving Grounds<br />
<br />
Proving Grounds worked out well, the devs will upgrade it and keep working on it in the future. They could break it up into a melee or ranged DPS version, provide more feedback when you make errors, or maybe even bring it to lower levels.<br />
The team is still thinking about letting you enter LFR with a lower than normal item level if you have the gold proving grounds achievement, especially with alts.<br />
Proving Grounds aren't perfectly evenly balanced for every class and spec, so they shouldn't be used to compare the different classes and specs. <br />
<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
<br />
The Live Raid bosses were picked because they are visually interesting and would fit in the timespan allotted.<br />
The big unannounced feature was really two features. One was cancelled and one was delayed until WoD. Ghostcrawler will let us know when it is added though!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Posts<br />
Connected Realms and Faction Balance<br />
Unfortunately it's not possible to solve faction balance completely. I expect many of you have heard us say this before, but there are way more Horde overall on European PvP realms than Alliance. On EU PvE realms it's the other way around, Alliance outnumber Horde. Short of forcing people to faction change (which is not a realistic option), there will always be faction imbalance to a certain degree.<br />
<br />
However, when choosing which realms to connect, we picked ones that improved the situation wherever possible. And in Warlords of Draenor, the PvP zone will make use of cross-realm technology to ensure there will be a good faction balance there to help with the PvP objectives.<br />
<br />
First of all, other than paid faction changes (20 euros or so lol) there are no incentives from your side to improve the situation at all. In fact, doing nothing only generated more revenue for you guys due to paid faction changes, where the outnumbered faction simply joined the winning team.<br />
Actually we have a great incentive to improve the situation: player happiness. If that isn't taken into account, we actually lose revenue. This is why we offer free character migrations for people on realms with queues, and if the realm is heavily imbalanced in favour of a particular faction, we tailor the FCM to ease that imbalance.<br />
<br />
So what could be done to somewhat solve the problem or flatten such an inbalance? Well, you could offer free faction changes. Other games have done that, you could do it. You have the tech to switch races in the blink of an eye. So there's no excuse not to offer it. While of course, for some realms where you have distributions like 1 : 10 you might want to offer a bit more than just a free faction change. Because, who would want to switch to the helplessly outnumbered faction anyway? But maybe a mount, or a pet (you are good a creating that stuff and selling it for 5-20 bucks anyway) or maybe some recruit a friend benefits. There are possibilities. There are things Blizzard could do.<br />
We've experimented with this before, and found that people are reluctant to move without their friends, guilds, etc. Plus, as it was mentioned above, no one wants to be the first one to move because they don't want to run the risk of ending up on the minority side. I personally don't think any kind of incentive like you mentioned would be enough to persuade a significant number of players to change faction, be disconnected from at least some of their network of friends, and potentially put them in a weaker position than before from a PvP standpoint.<br />
<br />
Having said that, we developed Connected Realms technology to help with low population realms, and we'll continue to look into ways to help with faction imbalance. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/280377-connected-realms-for-unbalanced-realms/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8715481514?page=2#21))<br />
<br />
Trial of the Gladiator<br />
From what I've seen and read, Blizzard are alternating days for more people to participate in arena and RBGS, so there will be more ques for both during them days, when it is not arena day, there will be skirmishes which i believe the community has been asking for, for a while now. I personally like this idea, as it means i can level up alts for pvp and just leave them in their competitive pvp gear whilst i get the chance to Gear my main. Personally i found it boring and tedious gearing up 3-8 alts and this change means i can be competitive on all of them. I see this change working positivity as it will stop win trading and make pvp competitive and fun once again.<br />
From what we know right now I believe alternate days is indeed the current plan.<br />
<br />
Everyone, please continue giving your thoughts on this feature but remember that the system is still in the works as we take on board your feedback, so try to keep it constructive<br />
<br />
EU blue does not deny Arena ladders canceled (atleast he did not say thing about it), but US blue says that thay have no plans to cancel it.<br />
I'm sorry if my post was confusing. As Lore said, we have no plans to remove the current Arena ladder. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/280374-arena-once-a-week-only-in-the-expansion/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8691049267?page=11#209))<br />

PvP<br />
PvP players feel like 2nd class citizens this xpac and well PvP lvls vs PvE, caps, tccy buff, much wrong after patch thoughts?<br />
We made a ton of changes to support PvP this xpack. You can disagree with the changes but I don't buy the 2nd class argument. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/382248412231380992))<br />
Example 1 &quot;I don't agree with the PvP ilevel change. The costs were worth than the problems it created for world PvP.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/382248517156102144))<br />
Example 2 &quot;Blizzard changed PvP ilevel because PvP players are second class citizens.&quot; See the difference? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/382248617722925057))<br />
<br />
My concern w this mindset is the message new players see: &quot;What you're doing now doesn't matter. Just level.&quot;<br />
I think the message is that it is almost played as two games, and most players are playing the max level one. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/382209618228699136))<br />
<br />
is it time to give spells a different function/dmg in pve and pvp? Make balancing easier. Balancing for pvp and pve is awful<br />
We give spells different functions in PvP all the time when we think that is the right solution. It's not a universal panacea. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385142276009119744))<br />
<br />
So you'd rather people get burnt out on gearing, than actually participate because it's fun?<br />
In fact the opposite can also be true: if we're not careful, players will engage in unfun things just for the power rewards. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/379427636377710593))<br />
<br />
So, do you play to address the joke that Blood DK's are in 2's?<br />
Sigh. Tanks in Arena are rarely fun for anyone but the tank. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384846004987498497))<br />
<br />
Have you ever thought about adding a spectating system for arena matches?<br />
We would love to, but technically it is not a trivial thing to build. (Not impossible, just not trivial.) (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384843988441632768))<br />
<br />
And ironically you maintain a very deterministic system in pvp. I guess pvp players aren't deserving of the joy of rng loot?<br />
We'd actually like to make PvP rewards less deterministic. We'd just have to be careful about how we did that. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384841995849449472))<br />
<br />
PVP is too deterministic. I would like drops from battlegrounds.. also at low levels.<br />
We don't like PvP rewards being so deterministic, but have yet to come up with a good design for an alternative. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/388718654063263744))<br />
<br />
Ghost , it pains me to see that you guys would sacrifice world pvp when you have pvp servers .<br />
I think flying mounts and server transfers had much bigger effects on wpvp than ilevels. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/386968916485894145))<br />

last time at blizzcon you said,you want offer many ways to get vp/gear/rep. Fact was that daily quests were the only way (c)<br />
There were many ways to earn valor and gear. There was only one way to earn rep, but even that we changed later on. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/388434691755241472))<br />

<br />
I am glad to see proving grounds doing well and interests to keep working on it to improve its use as a tool for players who want to improve themselves. It is also nice to see Flex tech bringing in far more flexability to the organized raiding scene in particular with the developers trying to kill the PuG raiding scene in favor of the random queue system.<br />

The big unannounced feature was canceled. But it was actually two things. And one of those things is merely delayed.<br />

...does anyone else feel like the big unannounced feature was scrapped and they're just trying to cover for it by doing something else?<br />
Just looking at all the new stuff brought in I am all the more curious what the developers was thinking of. It is possible that the delayed feature is the scaling down thing which is on the list of ongoing projects. I dont see what is wrong with replacing a scrapped project with something else when the alternative is getting nothing.</div></div><hr />

When 5.4 came and went, I think most assumed they were talking about Flex. Haven't heard any discussion on the &quot;unannounced feature&quot; since then. They could have just not mentioned it if that was the case, but they did. Though this certainly points towards scaling characters down for old instances.</div></div><hr />

Honey, if you're one of the DPS in LFR doing under 100k, then yes, you're being judged too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Calling people honey is incredibly condescending, which is probably why you did it, but in case you weren't aware, it's a jerk move.<br />
<br />
Regarding DPS in LFR doing under 100k: They might be getting judged, but they aren't getting kicked. I very rarely go into LFR, but the dozen or so I've seen have had tons of DPS below 100k, a couple people remark afterwards lol terribad dps, then move on. There is rarely any discussion about kicking those bad DPS.<br />
<br />
However, if a tank misses even one gouge on He, DPS scream bloody murder to kick the tank. Should that tank be kicked for failing? Sure, if every DPS under 100k were to be kicked as well, which would be damn near half of them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is true. The problem is, that you can pull some crappy dd's through lfr....with a crappy tank you are screwed. You can go without 2-3 dds...with 1 healer missing...but you need those 2 tanks.<br />
Then there is the problem that if one tank does not know what to do, there is only one other tank to explain it to him....cause not every dd knows exactly what a tank has to do in a particular encounter(just like tanks often don't know everything about the healer or dd job). If you have no idea of an encounter as a tank then it will be very obvious within the first minute of the fight.<br />
And last but not least you got many tanks that behave like &quot;F*** you all!&quot;-divas screwing over entire raids very well knowing that if they leave then the raid is dead. If you check for quitters that leave raids because &quot;the raid is not good enough for them.&quot;and compare that to the number of tanks, healers and dds in such a raid then the percentage of tanks and healers that quit is way higher than that of dds(at least my experience).<br />
<br />
I think it would be solved if tanks would be less mandatory. On the one hand a bad tank would then not hurt so much...and on the other hand tanks would actually have to try hard to earn their spot. We would need encounters where 3 tanks would be a benefit(even if one of them is crap)...but if there is just 1 tank then the encounter should be possible too. The current situation leads to diva-tanks and on the other hand players that always expect tanks to be perfect(cause if they ain't it always results in a wipe)...</div></div><hr />

I think it was for 5.5 , but they cancel patch, so feature delayed for WoD, and they also scrapped half of it as they didn't like how it went</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So, 'one was cancelled and one was delayed'? We know Timewalking is in the game, and they've said they just don't want to enable it until they have a good way to reward players for doing it. I'm guessing Timewalking is the 'delayed' feature.<br />
<br />
The 'cancelled' feature? Hmm...I have no idea. I don't think any near-feature was ever datamined in Pandaria and not implemented?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aureth</div><div class="date">2013-11-16, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They probably cancelled the feature so they could put as many hands on deck to get WoD pushed out the door ASAP. Which, well, makes sense-given that the past two expansions had unacceptably long tails at the end, they know this time they need to actually get it out at a decent time, and I think for the first time in their lives are actually working under a time constraint. It might not be one put on them by anyone, but since they've been dropping, rather than gaining subs, they don't want to take any chances regardless of how big they still are.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for faction imbalance, they should really look at Rift and just offer cross-faction guilds and groups. That won't help PvP servers, but absolutely *nothing* they do will help the high pop PvP servers with severe imbalance; unless they connect high-pop realms that's a lost cause. At LEAST they could solve half the issue of guild recruitment and such for PvE if they'd just put in cross-faction. It's apparent story-wise; the war is over, the next bunch of WoW is going to be Azeroth vs. Bad Guys, and it would be the most sensible thing they can do gameplay wise. With this, the higher-pop unbalanced PvE servers would at least have the more populated faction open for recruitment. Wouldn't again be a perfect fix, but it would be another attempt at some kinda fix. (Would deal with issues with racials as well, since you no longer would have to all jump to a faction because of certain racials. I'd like them to take out some of the racials anyway and leave the fun ones, but they seem adverse to that for some reason.) <br />

They should at least balance it better before they use that as a way to give people benefits, its easy to get gold on some classes and a lot harder on others (and it usually forces you to play and game/enchant totally different then in real raids)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Regarding DPS in LFR doing under 100k: They might be getting judged, but they aren't getting kicked. I very rarely go into LFR, but the dozen or so I've seen have had tons of DPS below 100k, a couple people remark afterwards lol terribad dps, then move on. There is rarely any discussion about kicking those bad DPS.<br />
<br />
However, if a tank misses even one gouge on He, DPS scream bloody murder to kick the tank. Should that tank be kicked for failing? Sure, if every DPS under 100k were to be kicked as well, which would be damn near half of them.<br />
<br />
<br />
I dont expect 100k dps in LFR.. I'd say 40-50k is min before I wonder what's up, and 70-80 average to good, 100k+ is usually done by people with some experience beyond LFR. <br />
<br />
I actually think the new loot system for 6.0 will help LFR, less chants and gems as a something that will help the more casual crowd LFR is aimed at.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been tanking for the majority of my WoW time and being a raid lead for a normal/heroic guild I'm very familiar with the fights and how they work. So when I get into LFR and the other tank insists on not paying attention to mechanics or disregarding any sort of coordination I have no recourse. Or the opposite: the taunt-happy tank who seems to operate on the principle that if it isn't attacking him something must be wrong. It's just frustrating because a poor tank can actually block a good tank from doing their job in several fights, or simply lead to their deaths by inactivity.<br />
<br />
I don't bother to tank LFR any more for that reason. I don't receive any personal recrimination from people and I've never been blamed for another tank screwing up, but the fact is that I like being a tank because it gives me control of the encounter and in LFR it's just too often ripped away by the other tank.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZehGeek</div><div class="date">2013-11-16, 09:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is true. The problem is, that you can pull some crappy dd's through lfr....with a crappy tank you are screwed. You can go without 2-3 dds...with 1 healer missing...but you need those 2 tanks.<br />
Then there is the problem that if one tank does not know what to do, there is only one other tank to explain it to him....cause not every dd knows exactly what a tank has to do in a particular encounter(just like tanks often don't know everything about the healer or dd job). If you have no idea of an encounter as a tank then it will be very obvious within the first minute of the fight.<br />
And last but not least you got many tanks that behave like &quot;F*** you all!&quot;-divas screwing over entire raids very well knowing that if they leave then the raid is dead. If you check for quitters that leave raids because &quot;the raid is not good enough for them.&quot;and compare that to the number of tanks, healers and dds in such a raid then the percentage of tanks and healers that quit is way higher than that of dds(at least my experience).<br />
<br />
I think it would be solved if tanks would be less mandatory. On the one hand a bad tank would then not hurt so much...and on the other hand tanks would actually have to try hard to earn their spot. We would need encounters where 3 tanks would be a benefit(even if one of them is crap)...but if there is just 1 tank then the encounter should be possible too. The current situation leads to diva-tanks and on the other hand players that always expect tanks to be perfect(cause if they ain't it always results in a wipe)...<br />
Because DPS are dime a dozen, and tanks and healers you have to wait. <br />
On your last point though, why have Tanks have to specificly earn their spot? Why not everyone have to earn their spot? <br />
Diva tanks is because if you're doing Fallen Protectors and some random Warlock is yelling &quot;TANK, TAUNT THIS FKN ADD OFF ME, GOD DAMN IT,&quot; when the add isn't tauntable and fixates, you're not going to be very happy. Nor people constantly pulling ahead of you. <br />
<br />
Some people do know the enounter, and are willing to give a quick rundown, but when you have people like this:<br />
<br />
TRANSLATION:<br />
<br />
I rolled a Tank into LFR without reading up on the fights and expected to inconvenience 24 other players by asking them how to do my job. Blame the terrible tanks that can't be arsed to read boss mechanics for the 30 min queue times.<br />
Really discouraging, even if you do know a basic idea of what to do. Reading about the encounter, is different then actually seeing it, specially in a 25 man setting.<br />
<br />
<br />
The drop in the number of tanks in Raid Finder is partially due to how they are treated. (If you want faster queues, be nice to your tanks!)<br />
<br />

Have you actually tanked in a really bad run? Mob mentaility is strong. Specially when everyone doesn't know what their doing, and a Warlock on protectors during He's desperate measures is like &quot;TANK, TAUNT THIS FKN ADD, BADDIE&quot;, and it takes not only me, but a DPS warrior who tries to taunt the fixated add, to tell him it's fixated.</div></div><hr />

They will start to release expansions more often, they will give fewer patches per expansion, and will provide us with fan art and &quot;new expansion&quot; content ideas for 5-6 months while we hold our sub fees waiting for a new expansion, but no experience any new content. MoP has barely been out for a year, maybe about 14 months, and they are already telling people that it will no longer be updated. So from now until WoD everything will once again feel irrelevant. I want to believe blizzard cares about its customers, but at the end of the day money&gt;quality product. They need to take a lesson from Anet, with multiple teams working on big projects that are spaced to come out at different times. I find it hard to believe that anet can afford more developers that Blizzard activision. <br />
<br />
Also i truly believe Activision is the kiss of death to any beloved franchise because they try to market it to everyone, make it as generic as possible, and release as much content that costs money as possible. Every Call of duty costs $60 with another $60 for dlc content (if you buy the season pass, its more if you dont). WoW on the other hand charges $15 monthly + $40 for expansion. Figure they try to release an expansion every 18 months. $15*18+$40*2= $350/18=19.222*12=$233.33 per customer per year, just to play the most up to date current content. That doesnt consider any extra purchase for the game. Activision is great at business but lousy at making a good game, and i say the WoW community finally speaks up with their vote that count, which is your money. Break the shackles of this game that abuses you for your money.</div></div><hr />

Agreed completely, and you are always the first to get targeted for a kick after a wipe. It is so much less annoying to just go as a healer and just relax and cast spells. You don´t have to play hard or be stressed, just mindless spam a few spells and you will never get kicked.<br />

It's not just about PVP. Most stuck around because they got even MORE pvp. It's the bloated side that took the easy road.<br />
<br />
But now you can't pvp or pve. You can't sell anything, you can't buy anything. You have to use 3rd party websites to do anything more than LFG. OR, you can pay $150 to transfer your 6 toons to another server. 10 months of subs.<br />
<br />
The solution? Real damn easy. Flag this faction/server for free transfers, to anywhere. Give it a cooldown. Want to transfer to the bloated side? That'll cost you extra. Want to transfer to a server not bloated? FREE! All other servers, regular price. What's so hard about that?<br />
<br />
Just like saying &quot;connected realm&quot; vs. &quot;server merger&quot; is a move to keep the stock from plummeting, they don't want to do &quot;free&quot; transfers either to alarm people into thinking the game is on a nosedive for subs.</div></div><hr />

I will never tank again because people are idiots. If you want to wait 30min in queue then all you have to blame is yourselves, no one else.<br />
<br />
So you were too lazy to take 5 minutes of your time to look up an LFR tank guide on the Internet or even look in the Dungeon Journal, yet it's the other people who are the idiots? Of course, it could never be your fault, right?<br />
<br />
As a tank, you have responsibilities. You're in charge of positioning the boss, tanking the right mobs and switching with the other tank at the right time. Other players (DPS, healers) have responsibilities too, but their decisions usually have less impact on the proper execution of a fight, and more importantly: they can get away with not knowing the tactics. As a tank, you can't. You need to know every aspect of the fight before you pull. If you can't handle these responsibilities, don't queue up as tank.<br />
<br />
This is IMO also the reason there's not a lot of tanks. Most people just want to have a nice, laidback run, without the pressure that comes with being a tank.</div></div><hr />

^ This. If I'm tanking and I do something wrong, I'll own up to it and apologize (yes, I know I may be in the minority here), but I'm not the type to make the same mistake repeatedly. If you don't accept my apology and are rude about it, or are blaming me for things that aren't my fault, I'm outta there. You can enjoy your wait. I'll either queue again and get another near-instant queue, or go do something else, depending how fed up I am.</div></div><hr />
