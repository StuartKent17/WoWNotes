&lt;Hides in a shelter before people get a chance to comment&gt;<br />
Today we’re pleased to introduce the Pet Store for World of Warcraft, a new way for players to obtain in-game pets to join them on their adventures in Azeroth. Two brand-new companions are now available for purchase exclusively at the Pet Store in the online Blizzard Store: Lil’ K.T. and the Pandaren Monk.<br />
<br />
Make a Difference: Pandaren Monk Charity Pet<br />
Enter the Pandaren Monk, ( http://us.blizzard.com/store/details.xml?id=1100000763 ) a martial-arts expert who’s here to help celebrate the upcoming fifth anniversary of World of Warcraft. He may be cute, but he’s proof that even the softest of critters can overcome the hardest of circumstances. For every Pandaren Monk that finds its way to a player’s side between now and the end of the year (December 31, 2009 at 11:59 PDT), we’ll donate 50 percent of the $10 purchasing price to the Make-a-Wish Foundation in an effort to brew up a little hope, strength, and joy in a child’s life.<br />
<br />
Lil’ K.T., the Littlest Lich<br />
Lil’ K.T. is a miniature lich who bears a striking resemblance to the legendary lord of Naxxramas, Kel’Thuzad. But don’t let his diminutive stature fool you: Lil’ K.T. has a diabolical laugh and wields true power at his bony fingertips, randomly wreaking icy havoc on critters who dare to cross his path. You can now buy this new pet for $10 on the Blizzard Store. (http://us.blizzard.com/store/ )<br />
<br />
In order to receive a purchased pet, you’ll need to merge your World of Warcraft account with a Battle.net account. For more information on Battle.net, please visit the FAQ. ( https://us.battle.net/faq/index.html ) For more information on the new Pet Store, visit the Pet Store FAQ. ( http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_US&amp;articleId=29845 ) <br />
<br />
A few more details ...<br />
<br />
You will get a code after purchasing your pet, you can either use it for your own account or give it to a friend.<br />
If your Battle.net account is linked to multiple accounts you can only give it to ONE of your account. <br />
At this time you can already redeem them for both EU and US Battle.net accounts<br />
Pets are account bound<br />
<br />

<br />
However, 50% to the Make-a-Wish Foundation sounds good enough to buy the Pandaren Monk.<br />

Pet Store FAQ<br />
Why are you introducing this service?<br />
The Pet Store provides a new way for players to obtain unique companion pets outside of the game, which is something that has been requested by many players who enjoy World of Warcraft's non-combat companions.<br />
<br />
Will more companions be available for purchase in the future?<br />
We plan to add more pets to the Pet Store in the near future. Keep an eye on the official World of Warcraft website and the online Blizzard Store for details.<br />
<br />
Where can I go to purchase these pets?<br />
You can purchase these in-game companions by visiting this link or heading to the online Blizzard Store, where you'll find the Pet Store pets under the Collectibles tab. <br />
<br />
Will I be able to acquire these Pet Store pets by questing, through holidays, on in-game vendors, or by any other in-game methods?<br />
No. Pets purchasable through the Pet Store will not be obtainable through quests or other in-game means -- they're only available through the online Blizzard Store.<br />
<br />
How do I redeem a Pet Store pet once it's been purchased from the Blizzard Store?<br />
After you purchase the pet, you'll receive a code that can then be redeemed on any World of Warcraft account via Battle.net Account Management. You don't need to redeem the code on the same Battle.net account that made the initial purchase – feel free to send the code to a friend as a gift.<br />
<br />
Will these pets count toward pet-related achievements?<br />
These Pet Store pets will count toward the total number of pets a character has for achievements like Plethora of Pets or Lil' Game Hunter.<br />
<br />
Will these pets help me in combat?<br />
No, these pets are strictly cosmetic. They have some fun animations and sound effects, but they will not help you in PvP or PvE. <br />
<br />
What characters will receive the Pet Store pet that I purchase?<br />
Once you redeem your code on an individual World of Warcraft account, every character on the account will receive the pet in their in-game mailbox (including any characters you create in the future). If you wish to purchase the pet for multiple different World of Warcraft accounts merged with the same Battle.net account, you will need to buy a separate pet for each World of Warcraft account individually.<br />
<br />
**Please Note** If a character transfers off of the account where the pet is bound the pet will be lost.**<br />
<br />
How long will these Pet Store pets be available?<br />
We do not currently have any plans to remove these pets from the Pet Store. The Blizzard Store purchasing page will provide information on any changes to availability.<br />
<br />
In what regions are these pets available?<br />
The Pet Store pets are available only to players on realms located in North America, Europe, and Korea. A Battle.net account is required in order to redeem the pet.<br />
<br />
Charity Pet<br />
What charity will I be supporting when I purchase the Pandaren Monk pet?<br />
Donations from every sale of the Pandaren Monk pet through December 31, 2009, will be given to the Make-A-Wish Foundation. To find out more about this charity, please visit www.wish.org.<br />
<br />
How much of every Pandaren Monk pet sale will go to charity?<br />
For each Pandaren Monk sale, we'll donate 50% of the $10 purchase price to the Make-A-Wish Foundation. For more information on this charity, visit www.wish.org.<br />
<br />
How long will you be making this donation?<br />
We will continue to make a donation for each Pandaren Monk pet purchased until December 31, 2009 at 11:59 p.m. PDT.<br />
<br />
Will the pet still be available for purchase after the donation period is over?<br />
Yes, you will still be able to purchase the pet after December 31, and we do not currently have any plans to remove this pet from the Pet Store. The Blizzard Store purchasing page will provide information on any changes to availability.<br />
<br />
Does this mean you'll be introducing more services like this in the future? Will you be introducing the ability to buy epic weapons/etc. in the future, for example?<br />
As with the pets, mounts, and other items players can obtain through Loot cards from the World of Warcraft Trading Card Game, Pet Store pets are purely cosmetic and just for fun. Like other paid services we offer, such as Paid Name Changes, Race Changes, and Character Re-Customizations, the Pet Store service is entirely optional and intended to provide players another means to enjoy World of Warcraft in a way that isn't detrimental to the game and that doesn't detract from the gameplay experience for players who choose not to use the service.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the panda does nothing, so they'll donate money to a charity. KT kills critters but blizz keeps all the money. Guess which one will sell the most? Coincidence?<br />
<br />
Also, maybe two years down the road there will be a store to buy your epix.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casteroc</div><div class="date">2009-11-04, 08:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I kind of like this idea even though I know it will upset a lot of people because they will see it as a leading down a slippery slope that ends in selling gear for money. Personally I don't think Blizzard will ever do that, but who knows. In reality this is nothing different than what they do for Collector's Editions, so I don't think it's a big deal at all.<br />
<br />
I'll definitely be buying the Pandaren Monk. The Make-a-Wish foundation is a great organization that Blizzard has done some great work with in the past.<br />
<br />
Finally, I don't understand why people get upset that Blizzard does whatever it can to make money. What else do you expect a multi-million dollar corporation to do? If you don't want to give them your money, then don't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't like it? Don't buy it. Get over yourselves and realize Blizzard is a company who's first interest is to make money, not bend over backwards in light of some imaginary moral compass people only have as an excuse to throw a temper tantrum over trivial crap. <br />
<br />
That said, some of you need to read up on &quot;Slippery Slope&quot;.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vashdakari</div><div class="date">2009-11-04, 08:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">50% is actually really good in the world of charity donations. Like Eyetotem said, usually they're just giving a dollar or something, or even better, the undisclosed &quot;portion of your purchase goes to&quot; shenanigans.<br />
<br />
While i don't fully agree with the whole &quot;buy your stuffs&quot; idea, it at least is better than the Cardgame, where you'll buy cards and cards and cards hoping for a random loot card. This way they're just straight up taking your money and at least you're getting exactly what you want.<br />
<br />
I've never bought anything WoW related outside the usual subscription fee, but i'd be tempted with the Pandaren.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Firstly, to the people complaining... so what? You don't HAVE to buy them and the people that do won't get any advantage over the people that don't.<br />
<br />
I am totally going to buy both of them when i get paid... Pandaren Monk 50% goes to Charity and Lil' KT... HE FRICKIN KILLS CRITTERS!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">farinar</div><div class="date">2009-11-04, 08:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seriously? What is up with the comments here!?<br />
It's 50 % of the price for charity! That's quite a lot! And it's a good cause!<br />
Or don't you people care about small children dying? Seriously, some of you disgust me!<br />
You always QQ that Blizzard wants all your money! Now they're fucking giving it away to people who needs it more! And do they get - &quot;They want money!&quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah sure, it's only the Pandaren pet that gives money to Charity but it's still a damn good message to send that they not only care about their player-base or our money but that they also care about charity. Years ago they took in a sick boy, gave him a phoenix, let him design an NPC, gave him a unique weapon and so much more! It's a very good and noble cause and if you're against that then maybe you should try being a dying child who really wants to ride a pony before he dies or something.<br />
<br />
Also, if you're so much against a company trying to raise more money then you're downright dumb. They don't force you to buy the pets but merely offer them if you like them. They don't go &quot;Buy pet or we'll kill you in your sleep.&quot; If you're against them selling pets, then fucking just don't buy the pets. However, I'm sure a lot of you people will actually buy them.<br />
<br />
People seem to think that everything Blizzard does is to earn more money. Seriously. Do you expect a company not to want more money? If you do, then you're retarded. Afterall, the money goes to designers, writers, actors, programmers, musicians and many more that makes the game you are playing today. They do this to offer more cool pets and more service to the playerbase but ofcourse nobody seems to like Blizz despite the fact that they support charity and will give you a fucking free in-game pet in 2 weeks at their 5 year anniversary.<br />
<br />
Blizzard already gives us a lot and charge us a low price of 14 $ each month for all the great content and gameplay we get. These pets costs 10$ and if you don't like giving money to a good cause or supporting the people keeping the game alive then it's your choice. I like the fact of them donating money to charity, so I'll buy the pandaren, cos it's hella cool also.</div></div><hr />

<br />
last I checked this wasn't a korean mmo with a cash shop.<br />
<br />
And while this is only 2 pets, it won't just end here.<br />
<br />
Is the plan for the additional 'character customization' they've talked about wanting to have, to be purchase based?<br />
Like every godawful mmo that has any form of money &gt; ingame items.<br />
----<br />
Thrall Face - $10.00 us<br />
Dread Lord Horns - $5.00 us<br />
Dread Lord Wings - $20.00 us<br />
<br />
Don't forget a mount shop.<br />
----<br />
Limited edition Flame Leviathan mount - $50.00 us<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also. People on their high horse about charity. The Pandaren Monk donation only lasts for 2 months (dec. 31)<br />
Lil K.T. is not a charity item at all.<br />
<br />
Using charity as a means to ease in a powerhouse money maker like this, is pretty low in all honesty.<br />
The 50% donation is great and all. But it won't always be there. And I highly doubt we'll see such a thing very often, if at all after the Pandaren.<br />
<br />
This pretty much spells out all the high end pet and mount models, and who knows what else they have cooked up. Will be purchasable only in a year. <br />
I love collecting pets and mounts. Many people do. We pay a subscription fee for a reason, for access to rewards like these pets as long as we can devote ourselves.<br />
<br />
They aren't forcing you to buy them, no.<br />
But like I said, the quality/quantity of new vanity this-and-thats will diminish to a nonexistent level in a year.<br />
Why make a brand new mount/pet model, with unique animations and/or sounds and give them away in game?<br />
When they can now massively profit off them. Our subscription fees paying designers to make PREMIUM content, that our subscription fee doesn't cover.<br />
<br />
The TCG is a different story. A couple loot cards per each series of cards. No big deal.<br />
But now any new pets/mounts/etc at any time during development are up for grabs to be shoved into their shop. It's a devastating path that will very greatly hurt the customers in the long run. This isn't a free mmo, it'd be completely understandable and acceptable if it was.</div></div><hr />

The only reason they are probably doing the charity thing is for people who wouldn't do it at all in the first place will probably buy both if they are buying one. <br />

Bingo. The TCG has dominated the market for cool in game items like this. The Monk and lil KT are far cooler than the TCG pets (imo) so I will be happy to only have to pay $10 for them if I choose rather than $50+ or whatever nutty amounts the monkey and hippogryff baby go for.<br />

This is good supplemental income for Blizzard especially since they are facing the very real threat of permanently losing half their player base to Communism. No better way to prove Capitalism is better than through methods like this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Many operations that give 1% are on items they are normally selling without giving to charity, plus there is production costs. Providing this costs Blizzard very little, even including the initial development cost. I would expect similar percentages or much higher for similar items like a signed autograph.<br />
<br />
Yes, this is a slippery slope blizzard is going down. They are just cutting out the middle man in the process of doing so (instead of going though a TCG or though direct TV). I would not be surprised if they started offering mounts too (seeing that you can get them with the TCG anyways). I would be mildly surprised if they started offering titles for $ though.<br />
<br />
Everything is worth what its purchaser is willing to pay for it. There are a lot of people that are willing to pay 10x cost of subscription right now. This just helps empty the pockets of those willing to do so. PLUS you can tease someone for outright spending money on that, they have no excuse (they can't say, but it was everything else in the collector's edition I wanted) unless they lie and say it was a gift.<br />
<br />
If this type of system helps keep the current subscription fees as their current value (instead of going up with inflation) I'm all for it. Provided that they don't start offering items that can obtained in the game in some way other than spending real $$.</div></div><hr />

as a mater of fact, they are ran by rainbow juice created from the tears of laughing unicorns.

Oh and people c'mon... sure, Blizzard could make these available in-game via an achievement or whatever, but it's not like Blizzard is selling tier gear for money akin to how some other games sell items for real money. WoW isn't a microtransaction-supported game. These are just fun items that you can buy... don't people also buy the loot cards on eBay for pets and mounts? Instead of going to some random lucky eBayer, you're now supporting the company you know and love (or possibly hate right now :P).</div></div><hr />

I've seen tons of changes lately: PvE to PvP, gender change, race change, faction change, etc. That's fine. But trying to drag more customers in the net of Blizzard just whispering the word &quot;charity&quot; makes me feel bad and embarrassed for being a Blizzard customer.<br />

Not only do you now pay monthly for a game that is not better than alot of free games (only the community is larger hence more group play etc which makes it seem better) but now you also have item stores.<br />

So Euro-users are actually spending $14.76, and Pound-users are shelling out $14.87...<br />

No, I am paying it 10 euros. If I feel the need to do something nice for someone less fortunate than me, I will personally hand him, them, whoever... 10 euros.<br />

I work as a volunteer 4 days/week in a hospital to entertain and/or help children (2-5 years old) who had bad luck with cancer fight.

Are you really dense enough to think that the server upkeep is more than a tiny percentage point of the huge waves of monthly income pouring in from the millions of people playing this game. <br />
<br />
This game is all profit. Even with a full time staff of developers, QOL employees, marketing, event planning, hell janitorial and maintenance staffing, and IT/datacenter services WoW is so hugely in the black that it's almost obscene. <br />

But as long as there are fucktards willing to throw money at them for worthless things like vanity pets they will by all means take it. Lulz at the people sticking up for corporations. Consume consume consume you fucking automatons.</div></div><hr />

I know any business is about making money, ut blizz seems very desperate for cash as of late and as a consumer you have to ask yourself where is the line drawn.

Would you rather they be rewarded in the redeemable prizes for the TCG? I promise that you will end up spending alot more then 20$ and you still might not get the pets. Oh and the money you spend on that doesn't go to a good cause. <br />

This is a very slippery slope indeed and that sad part that some ppl are too fucking stupid to realize it, not saying that you have to care but being ignorant to the situation is something different entirely. Quote me, flame me, or ignore this post idc just stating what very few can seem to see.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is an outstandingly profitable company, one of the most profitable in the industry at the moment. This isn't evil. Blizz isn't 'desperate' for cash, they're simply looking to expand. Check their hiring website sometime; they are CONSTANTLY hiring new people. They've got hundreds and hundred of programmers, GMs, artists, and more working for them. They're expanding currently into South America. People sue them left and right because they want a piece of the pie. That adds up to a lot of cash. Will Blizzard likely post a multi-hundred-million-dollar profit next year? Most likely. But there is nothing bad about that.<br />
<br />
In any case, vanity pets are just that - vanity. They're offering nothing that changes gameplay, and have drawn an EXTREMELY hard line with goldsellers and pay-for-play-and-gear services.<br />
<br />
And that said, dayum, I'm getting me a Lil KT. Also, whoever said that they'd rather spend the money on themselves instead of some 'stupid charity'.... /spit.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
I could've understood 2-3$, but that price is just insane..<br />
<br />
You got too much money if you're buying those pets, in my honest opinion.<br />
<br />
If 10 bucks is 'having too much money' in your opinion, then you may want to rethink your priorities... WoW probably shouldn't be near the top. Or among them at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
when they start selling items that enhance actual gameplay for real money.<br />
that's the line.<br />
before they do most people won't give a shit. and I am one of them.<br />
and when they do I'll cancel my account and most likely A LOT of others, so I'm pretty sure they won't<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
11.5million(customers) x $15= $172,500,000 per month<br />
as far as I know it's 11.5 mio accounts. that doesn't mean that each of these accounts gets blizz another 15bucks/month as they hardly ever delete inactive accounts and some people pay per gamecards and don't play 12months/year<br />
it's probably half of what you wrote</div></div><hr />

Its hard to come up with 10$ when you are barely scrounging enough money every 2 months to buy your game card. Living out of your parents basement with no job doesnt have alot of income. <br />
<br />
Why is everyone so bitchy about this? Its not like you are being forced to buy them. If they stated &quot;We are raising the monthly fee by 10$&quot;...then yeah I could see that. But again, mindless idiots posting about things they dont understand.</div></div><hr />

Bit annoyed that essentially Europeans have to pay more to get the pet, but then it always seems to be the case anyway. :P I may get Lil' KT I may not (no intrest in the Pandaren monk tbh). If I see him in-game and he's awesome with a side of awesomesauce I may treat myself to an early Xmas present. Heck at least some of the cash is going to charity. Could u imagine the shit-storm of QQ Blizzard would face if they hadn't given some of it to charity.<br />

1. Blizzard realizes that there are lots of scams going on where players are selling pet shop codes for in game gold.<br />
-- Blizzard allows the pets to be tradeable.<br />
2. Players buy pets and sell them for lots of gold, and then use the gold to buy crafted items.<br />

<br />
<br />
I'll make a correction to this statement. While MS does have vanity items that change character looks as you said, some of the things they sell in-game for money include certain things that would probably do fine as an in-game currency sink. Examples include paying not to lose EXP from dying, the MS equivalent of &quot;re-speccing&quot;, and an in-game lottery system.<br />
<br />
And while some of the microtransactions in WoW do affect gameplay (Faction Xfer, Realm Xfer), the rest of them, including these new pets, do not provide tangible in-game benefits. That's how the TCG items and Collector's Edition boxes worked as well. You pay extra to get cool things that don't do anything that provides a significant advantage in-game.<br />
<br />
So again, if you think WoW is going on a slippery slope with these micro-transactions, take a look at one of those free MMOs, like MapleStory, and you'll be appaled at what some of those free MMOs sell.</div></div><hr />

Does this mean you'll be introducing more services like this in the future? Will you be introducing the ability to buy epic weapons/etc. in the future, for example?<br />
As with the pets, mounts, and other items players can obtain through Loot cards from the World of Warcraft Trading Card Game, Pet Store pets are purely cosmetic and just for fun. Like other paid services we offer, such as Paid Name Changes, Race Changes, and Character Re-Customizations, the Pet Store service is entirely optional and intended to provide players another means to enjoy World of Warcraft in a way that isn't detrimental to the game and that doesn't detract from the gameplay experience for players who choose not to use the service.<br />

<br />
A charity, and the people it serves, does not care how much each donator donates in proportion to their income. If Blizzard only donated $5 TOTAL, the charity wouldn't care, it is 5 more dollars to make dreams come true.<br />
<br />
$5 dollars, depending on the charity, can give a child clothing for the winter. Can provide one more meal for a poor family. Can do so much. If you think these charities actually sit around and whine about how much money a donating organization can donate, then you need to get off of your couch and actually work to help people. Because you clearly haven't.</div></div><hr />

The great thing about capitalism? If you can't afford it you don't have to buy it. You have a choice. If you really want it, go get a job, beg your parent, rob a store and get it. <br />
<br />
Micro transactions aren't a new concept. If you own an Ipod touch and buy apps, you've already done it. Ton's of other MMO's do it. <br />
<br />
Also for people who lack the ability to understand how a business survives. Sure WoW in the current state is profitable, but then what happens 5-6 years down the line? Eventually WoW will plateau, and shrink. Blizzard's revenue is going to ensuring that they will remain profitable in the future as well by developing new IP's and games.</div></div><hr />

Not only are they trying to make money but they're having their profits by donating half the sales of the monk to charity. Which is just terrible that they're doing this whole thing on launch when the most people are likely to buy. =( I say we take the people who work for blizz, and the guy who owns that 7/11 down the street from you. And the guy at the soup place down the lane, and everyone trying to sell something on trade for a profit, and throw them in a pit! How dare they try to make money.... EVIL <br />

FUCKING BLIZZARD, ARE YOU TRYING TO GET MONEY OUT OF US BECAUSE PEOPLE IS QUITTING OR WHAT?!<br />
<br />
well, I think is known that 11million isn't the number anymore, it has been declining since WTLK , people bought the game, and quitted, oh yeah, and the ones who hated WTLK quitted, so Blizzard decided to get greedy by allowing pve to pvp server transfer change , gender change, faction change, etc, things that they said it &quot;NEVER WILL HAPPEN&quot; but it did because they want the money, greedy fuckers, WOW is just becoming another SRO but with subscription, I was wondering what was next.... days later they come up with &quot;pets&quot; wtf?! what is tomorrow? selling witches dress and ninja suits? <br />
Oh yeah, and with the expansion pack where you can only level 5 levels they also got greedy, not 10 but 5 levels so they can release another Xpac in 1 year or so.<br />
<br />
<br />

Soon WOW will be so expensive I will have to change to SRO or any other MMORPG<br />

note: I know is cosmetic, but if you dont have it you are not a &quot;cool&quot; kid....while in the free MMOs you pay for these items and that mantains the game, and you choose not to give any money to the game by not buying this kinds of items, but WOW, wtf! WE PAY MONTLY!</div></div><hr />

Again, where do you think those free MMOs get their money to stay in business and to make a profit? Micro-transactions. And to make sure they get a steady stream of revenue from them, they'll make some things that you would think would be standard in the game as micro-transactions. Those things include preventing EXP loss, buying a pre-made character of the XXth level, Gender changes in games where gender actually affects gameplay, and in some games, you even have to pay to participate in certain in-game events!</div></div><hr />

Epic retort, bro. Lemme know when you take off your tin foil hat.<br />
<br />
Back on topic, they even SAY that this service is explicitly cosmetic. They chose to do this specifically because it has no effect on gameplay or on people that don't use the service. This isn't the end of WoW, and there's nothing wrong with Blizzard wanting to make money. There is ESPECIALLY nothing wrong with them giving a huge chunk of it to charity. To the people that complain that they aren't sending enough of the cash to charity, then you should propose that you will match and exceed their donation. Their likely-over-hundred-thousand-dollar donation.<br />
<br />
And, again, this is NOT a new phenomenon. Blizzard has been doing this for YEARS through the card game. If anything, the cool vanity stuff now costs LESS because mofos can't sell them on Ebay for 500 bucks.</div></div><hr />

First with paid transfers, paid name changes, gender changes, faction changes, &amp; race changes (class changes soon). Now, a &quot;non-combat pet store&quot; where you buy in-game pets. This is the beginning. I predict within a year or so they'll introduce buying mounts, titles, tabards, guild name changes, etc. Then eventually they'll introduce buying gear, crafting mats, and probably &quot;premade leveled&quot; characters (if you pay extra the character will come with a set of gear). Buying gold from the Blizzard store might come about one day also.<br />

<br />
It's a service where they give you an item in exchange for money.<br />
There is no other purpose than to make money. Video games are a BUSINESS.<br />
If they didn't offer 50% to charity, people wouldn't be like &quot;they should give some to charity!&quot;, but if they do offer 50% of it to charity people are like &quot;give more!&quot;<br />
Just be happy they're giving 50%, whereas most big business charities offer 1% and then brag that they give. It's an amazing cause.</div></div><hr />

The charity aspect? It's the start of the holiday season. Everyone and their grandmother is doing donations to various charities. And as others have said already, 50% of $10 as a donation is better than what most companies do.<br />
<br />
I don't know. Maybe this doesn't phase me because of a previous MMO I played. Before playing WoW, I played Maple Story (lol, I know). Now *THAT* is a company that tries to milk you for every cent you have. You wanna participate in x-holiday's event? Charge at least $5 to get something from the &quot;cash shop&quot;. You wanna get *anywhere* in the game? Charge money IRL for virtual currency to buy stuff that expires in 90 days (or less, in some cases). At least these pets are *permanent*.<br />

<br />
on one hand We don't want WoW going the route of idk say.. Maplestory? (everything is BOUGHT online).. WoW is worth 15 dollars a month.. that's where it should stop. Vanity items,pets and mounts should all be in-game rewards. the things like realm transfers,renaming, race change etc i can see because it's a huge change. but pets? come on blizz.. They're getting awfully close to &quot;paying real world money for an in-game advantage&quot;. <br />
<br />
next up well see... &quot;Dance Studio is here! for only 15$ you can unlock the SW or Org dance studio and have a blast!&quot;<br />
<br />
on the other hand.. who doesn't want to help kids? i mean.. if they decided to up the monthly fee and gave the extra 5 bucks to kids i would be all for it, hell if they gave in-game stuff to people who made donations directly to the charity I would.</div></div><hr />

Read about the new feature before you spew your nonsense. You are giving Blizzard 5$ for each pet you buy, the other 5 is going to charity. That is a great % they are sending to charity.<br />
<br />
So i guess they should charge TWENTY bucks for this great vanity-pet, since TEN (!!!) dollars will go to charity!<br />
NO, MAKE IT A HUNDRED!!! (50 for charity, guys!)<br />
<br />
Not to mention the awesomeness that is having microtransactions in a subscription-based game! It's like having Pay-TV and Pay-per-view at the same time! Wow!</div></div><hr />

back in the day:<br />
<br />
WOW:<br />
you paid montly and everything else you would get it by playing, the concept was that you pay and depending on effort that is what you get.<br />
<br />
<br />
FREE MMOs:<br />
you pay me nothing, only if you wanna be part of the cool kids you will have to pay to get cool items.<br />
<br />
<br />
today:<br />
<br />
WOW:<br />
pay me montly and I want more money, so if you wanna be a cool kid you will have to pay real money to us.<br />
<br />
FREE MMOs:<br />
stay the same, pretty much like WOW, but without montly charges.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I just think WOW is getting way too greedy, but whatever.<br />
:'( kills me that WOW is not and will never be the same, never again.<br />
<br />
<br />
If it bothers you so much, quit WoW and go pay a free MMO. You forget that Blizzard is a big business, they exist solely to make money. As far as business goes, they DO do a great job of trying to please customers as opposed to many corporation. 90% of cool things still come from hard work, though. You can buy 2 pets, amazing, but to get a Little Fawn or a Hyacinth macaw, you still have to work your ass off. You can buy a Spectral Tiger off eBay, but an ironbound proto drake still requires work.<br />
<br />
Blizzard does work their ass off to keep this game running, even if most people are too ingrateful or whiny to realize that. They have the right to try and make more money.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, apparently that charity drive made $18,000 with auctions for in-game weapons that do affect gameplay drastically. These pets, sure they may give you &quot;Awwws&quot;, kind of like how Tier gear did in vanilla WoW, but if you think that's so much of a big deal, then I don't know... :-X</div></div><hr />

lol just give it some time dude, you will see, playing this game for so long has thought me that:<br />
<br />
WOW is going that direction..... the &quot;WE WILL NEVER&quot; ....is known as &quot;MAYBE , IF WE CAN MAKE IT WORK&quot;<br />
<br />
for example:<br />
we will never - pve to pvp tranfer<br />
we will never - people change faction<br />
we will never - change gender<br />
<br />
but $$$$$$$ changes people , and of course, companies, I know is all bussiness, but WOW is going that direction.<br />
Before I would NEVER even think Blizzard would sell gold, now I think they will, just give it some time, or even sell items that make people OP, they are going that direction because of money.</div></div><hr />

uh... last i knew pets weren't required... and one of them is (at the moment) there for charity.<br />
<br />
so... you don't like the idea of paying 10 bucks for a pet? don't.<br />
<br />
<br />
or perhaps them taking $5 of the $10 for the monk is greedy? fuck it, donate 10 bucks on the make a wish site and skip the monk all together.</div></div><hr />

Yes but how many people would rather have a deer or blue and purple parrot over a freaking pandaren and miniature version of a boss that both have unique animations and sounds... Blizzard isn't forcing anyone to buy anything, true, but you know that there will still be a lot of people that will buy these just to feed their pet collecting hobby even after the charity thing is over...</div></div><hr />

Again, in some free MMOs, you have to pay for extra in-game benefits that are probably standard in WoW.</div></div><hr />

You do realize that none of those changes actually affect gameplay (combat and performance, obviously being on a different faction does change certain things such as locations and people), right? They've simply grown more comfortable with changing things, and if it doesn't change gameplay and people want it, why not add it? It's optional.<br />
Gold and gear however, will detrimentally change gameplay. There's a line that they probably know not to cross.</div></div><hr />

If you don't like the idea of paying real cash for a vanity pet, then don't. A vanity pet store is not the same thing as the Korean MMO's. Those offer items that do enhance gameplay by offering weapons, exp, gold, whatever. A vanity pet helps you level or play WoW any better than a player who doesn't have a vanity pet.<br />
<br />
And if you don't like the way Blizzard conducts it's business, then shut up and cancel your subscription. It's just that simple.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah well, the fact that Lil' K.T does not contribute to Make-a-wish, means that K.T is probably considered the prototype product for new stuff.<br />
<br />
No problem with that, i don't plan on buying these pets, despite little K.T tendency to ice tomb critters and laugh. It gives me a chuckle, but chuckles are not worth ten bucks (Discount Comedian CD/DVDs please)<br />
<br />
All in all though, if you have a problem with the pets, don't buy them.</div></div><hr />

If anything, this is a massive discount from that, because you typically have to pay a couple hundred or more for a cool loot card off of ebay.</div></div><hr />

Some of those kick ass pets that were found by this site a few weeks back are likely to be next on the Pet Store...<br />
<br />
Those being the Corehound Pup,Wyvern Cub,Gryphon Hatchling, and the Toxic Wasteling...<br />
<br />
It would make sense if they were all always contributing to charity, but no... seems like Blizz definitely learned from the Arena Tournament and Blizzcon Internet Stream... people will pay through the nose to get mini pets and other collectibles...<br />
<br />
IMO they should have left the mini pets for real money thing to the TCG...<br />
<br />
<br />
Ooooh, I forgot about the Wyvern Cub! I hope they sell that one soon, I'd love to have it!</div></div><hr />

Or they could just hire next time someone who has elementary knowledge of economics.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if they really wanted to give money to the charity, they could open a random devs garage and sell the first ferrari they see.<br />
<br />
If the cash shop makes WoW f2p, I am for it. 8) Sadly, the power of mamon is unresistable.</div></div><hr />
