Armory Stats - Professions<br />
It is another quiet holiday week, so today we are taking a look at the professions of Level 90 characters at the end of Mists of Pandaria and Level 100 characters today. There are 3.7 million characters and 2.5 million accounts that make up this sample. Keep in mind data collection started recently, so there may be some characters that we haven't come across yet.<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor also changed how professions work, significantly reducing the incentive to cap your profession right away by not gating items with a required high skill level. In Mists of Pandaria, 95% or more of players capped most professions, but this has significantly changed.<br />
<br />
If you have any requests for other stats be sure to let us know in the comments, as a quiet week is a good time to fulfill requests! <br />

Some are still relevant to mains (JC, Enc) but after a couple of weeks the gear becomes mostly pointless with very few exceptions. The random roll stats is pretty irritating but I understand why they added the functionality to do so.</div></div><hr />

Mining and Herbalism became totally void, cooking also. Buff-food you can produce with cooking is not worth any more as you can get 100's meals from the barn.<br />
Maxing Alchemy was way easier than my main's professions Jewelcrafting or Enchanting (which both are not maxed until now!) - one daily cd for the mana potion's recipe and then brewing mana potions (mandatory for healers) until 700.<br />
I have no miner any more, though my ores are crowding my character's banks. Draenor stones - for work orders at the mine - are also stacking, instead the grain from the garden is too less every time, even with a level 3 garden. So you need herbalism to get 1000 grains fast enough for the pet. Then you don't need them any more.<br />
<br />
I will max-level the professions for the achievements, then use the barn for the 100's meals, my alchy for the flasks and potions, my main's enchanting and jewelcrafting for upgrading the equipment and the remaining professions will be ignored as soon as they're 700.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">middling</div><div class="date">2014-12-31, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">RE: professions<br />
From a person that had every profession maxed in Mists I am finding less and less incentive to do much with my professions this time around.<br />
I got all my alts started on day 1 of the expansion, made some gold selling the 630-640 armor, made some gold selling savage blood through mining primal spirits but now it just seems kinda blah.<br />
I don't even do the daily cooldowns anymore. I was super excited to read about doing 3 daily CDs at once only to learn they scrapped that idea.<br />
There is not much point getting professions to max anymore. Also it's a bit of a double edged sword. On the one hand I love that the missions give out decent gear over time, but at the same time this gives me even less incentive to work on my professions.<br />
I'm sure there are people that are still playing the AH game relentlessly by crafting as much stuff as possible but that's just not me.<br />
I also miss having any incentive to go out and get certain recipes. Whether that is gated behind a certain skill level, gated behind a reputation or gated behind a mob drop in a dungeon.<br />
I fondly remember farming Gnomeregan for recipes. Personally it made me feel a bit more special having recipes that were a bit harder to get.<br />
However, I will say for newer players it's probably very nice to not need old world materials or the need to visit the trainer 6-8 times before you are max level.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Felade</div><div class="date">2014-12-31, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only thing about the new professions that bothers me is Savage Blood, and lack of shuffles. Enchanting is just as good as it has always been (source of free enchants for myself, mats and enchants sell well). Jewelcrafting has potential, since the number of sockets people have will tend to increase as people farm gear, and I bet Blizz will slightly increase the drop rate of sockets as we go along. The armor crafting professions depend too much on Savage Blood, and 15 is a bit too much for an upgrade patch. However, I've still been able to sell the base patterns enough to pay for the gear I bought on the first few days of level 100.<br />
<br />
I think the lack of shuffles is there so that we don't feel like we need the synergistic effects of having every profession on several alts like we have in the past. It was a fun interaction, but having to level so many alts with professions was too steep a requirement. Professions like Enchanting, Jewelcrafting, Inscription and Alchemy are still useful on alts, though.<br />
<br />
Its funny to me that people complain about how long it takes to reach 700 skill in their professions. Why does it matter how long it takes to reach 700 if you can do everything that's important starting at 1 skill?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the main thing people want is the &quot;extra&quot; materials created when your skill is 700.<br />
I don't know the math on what % better it is, but as far as I know that's the only advantage.</div></div><hr />

Herbalism and Mining are useless now, I did not even bother to send my gathering char to Draenor.<br />
I have ore and herbs like never before and can do less with it than ever.<br />
<br />
Enchanting is a bad joke now, especially since old enchants can not be applied to items above itemlevel 600.<br />
Engineering got three pets, an useless toy and the swap-blaster which for some stupid reason is not a toy, everything else is just new versions<br />
of things we had before.<br />
<br />
Oh, forgot about cooking and fishing.<br />
Cooking is useless now because the best meals are supplied by the barn.<br />
Fishing got canned with this stupidly quick change to alchemy, before it was not half-bad.</div></div><hr />

All of my alts who have crafting professions are at 100, and yet I have only crafted a couple of items. I do the daily cool downs on them all ... i have shiatloads of crafting materials but no motivation to craft anything. If I could outfit an alt entirely with gear that i made, then yes I would make stuff.<br />
<br />
The first week I crafted a neck for my guardian druid, then made/bought a dozen re-rolls in an attempt to get some bonus armor. It really turned me off to the crafting professions in WoD. Since then ... i made a couple shields and engineering googles. Occasionaly some cards for decks.</div></div><hr />

Plus the Enchanters Study illusions are awesome. Must have been a lot of JC rerolls since it was inferior for some classes DPS-wise last xpac. I'm planning on doing 2 JC rerolls myself.<br />
<br />
Engi is still up there from last xpac and non-consumable versions of the glider, jeeves, and moll-e make it one of the best main profs. Definitely the best for quality of life if golds not a huge deal.<br />
<br />
But yeah, don't see how the other profs can keep up unless they introduce new craftables. At least tailoring has bags.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I miss sitting down to a task and finishing it, I leveled all my alts profs in MoP, but the thought of doing it in WoD, or the point of even doing it. It is just rubbish, the slow grind of logging on each day making the craftables.<br />
<br />
They've ruined professions. I haven't even gone out into Draenor to gather any of the materials needed, they've all come from my garrison. The only exception would be those god damn traps for the barn, which I hate grinding with so many other players in the same location.<br />
<br />
They should scrap all gathering professions and make them part of the main professions, you get LW and you can skin, you get enchanting you can disenchant, so it makes sense. Make going out into the world and spending a little time gathering materials to level your professions part of the game again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The removal of so many enchants/item enhancement makes that a non-thing. Crafted PvP gear was a waste of time at least on my server. Market was flooded with em undercut below crafting cost. <br />
<br />
Sure mining/herbing isn't that useful now but what would you even do with it if the price was higher. Flasks/potions are cheap right now. Gems are basically the easy to get green ones or over budget blue ones that aren't worth the current investment this early. <br />
<br />
I acknowledge the issues, but I've seen no solutions in WoD. The rich don't really have a reason to spend their money and the poor aren't sure how to make it. The only thing I see that might help with that is the game time selling thing. That could redistribute wealth some.</div></div><hr />

Herbalism is useful, as herbs are still somewhat difficult to come by relative to Ore. Now, Mining, that is utterly useless in every way now. I'm convinced that there will be a major change to the gathering professions in a patch or two.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Eh, Garrison mines/herbs are going to be nerfed some more.<br />
<br />
Overall I am thinking that the Garrisons are going to see some sweeping changes once Bliz gets back to work and starts parsing the data ... and of course subs drop in the first quarter. I would not be surprised at all to see a drastic sub drop in next report.<br />
<br />
BTW, if you want to know why people aren't missing flying, its cause they don't leave their garrisons. The only place people are out in the world (not questing) is gathering lumber.</div></div><hr />

Frostweed, and only Frostweed, holds any value. If you are an Alchemist level Alchemy and running an alchemy shack, you most likely will have a shortage of Frostweed if you play casually (2 hrs a night or less). You need 5 frostweed per day for the daily book, 5 per work order, and if you are running a tradepost too you run into days where Frostweed is the mat of the day.<br />
<br />
Just using herb garden, even at level 3, you gotta pray to the RNG gods to get more than 20 in a day. Somedays I'd get 7 from my work orders, 0 in the garden.<br />
<br />
Beyond Frostweed every other mineral and herb in this game is on par with trash loot. My reagent bank is overfilled.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chickenbuttlips</div><div class="date">2014-12-31, 05:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a great disparity between the crafting professions, which is directly tied to the issues with gathering professions. The exceptions would be jewelcrafting and enchanting, which suffer from a lack of resources in one way or another. This has been my experience between my main and 12 max-level alts (mind you, these are all estimates and not exact figures):<br />
<br />
Materials<br />
<br />
Mining<br />
Between 13 toons, ranging from level 1 to level 3 Excavations, time spent on gathering ore takes between 30 to 45 minutes combined, approximately 5 to 15 minutes each. <br />
<br />
Herbalism<br />
Between 7 toons who currently have the garden unlocked, level 1 to level 3 respectively, time spent on gathering herbs takes about 20 minutes combined, 2 to 5 minutes each. Each toon has Fiona working in the garden and grows a specific herb (i.e., Gorgorond Flytrap, Frostweed, Starflower, etc.).<br />
<br />
Skinning<br />
I only have 2 skinners in my coterie of commanders that spend anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour farming 200-225 skins. I timed myself on my last farm run for leather in Nagrand and it took an hour to get about 250. <br />
<br />
Cloth<br />
Sumptuous furs take a lot of time to gather. I have a system down where I send out my skinning alt to Nagrand to farm beasts, which seems to be the most efficient way to get the fur I need. During the same hour it took for me to get 250 skins, I got 110 sumptuous furs. This process is repeated 2 to 4 times a week in order to keep up with tailoring demands for my main alone. Only one alt benefits as well, but only as an after thought. My third tailor gets nothing. So I switched from tailoring to mining, since that toon is also a jewelcrafter.<br />
<br />
Crafting<br />
<br />
Tailoring<br />
The Hexweave daily cool-down requires 20 sumptuous furs and 10 Gorgorond flytraps, with 5 sumptuous furs required for each work order. I run out of furs every two days or so, hence my farming above (see Cloth). Even the barns cannot keep up with demand. However, epic items sell for the same price, and in some cases lower, than Blacksmith weapons on the Auction House. Hence, my entire focus is on my main and upgrading his gear.<br />
<br />
Leatherworking<br />
Burnished Leather requires 20 skins and 10 flytraps, much like tailoring. Since skins are more readily available via skinning in Nagrand and I only have one leatherworker, I have to farm leather 2 times a week. Even so, I run out of the skins very quickly and have been forced to make a third and even a fourth trip out to Nagrand. On paper, the mats required seem easy to obtain, but in practice it is actually drawn out, with many occasions where I do not have the required materials for the daily cool-down and/or work orders. <br />
<br />
Jewelcrafting<br />
Currently, the only way to get gems is through the daily jewelcrafting cool-down and/or the Gem Boutique, not via the ore which was traditionally the only means to get gems. The mats required for cool-downs and recipes makes this a rather arduous and monotonous process. Consequently, my raiding main only has green-quality gems in Warforged sockets. There's no point in making the blue-quality gems at this juncture when considering that the pieces I'm wearing will become obsolete in the coming weeks. At this rate, I don't think I will have blue-quality gems in pieces until the next raid tier.<br />
<br />
Enchanting<br />
I was one of the fortunate ones who benefited from the guaranteed Luminous Shards, so I have quite a few from those first few days of leveling, which I use for the daily Temporal Crystal cool-down. In contrast, the dearth of Draenic Dusts has remained even after the fix. My alts have fed my main, as I have an Enchanters Study in nearly all of my toons' garrisons for that reason. Using my main and 12 alts quest rewards, I manage to maintain a regular flow of work orders and daily cool-downs without a break. Note: I do not disenchant items that are worth 35 gold and above for obvious reasons.<br />
<br />
Blacksmithing<br />
No issue where, except I have more materials than I could ever need. I now have over approximately 7,000 of each ore across all my toons. I have two Blacksmiths and they are well-oiled machines pumping out piece after piece of armor and weaponry. And as you can imagine, I am making some good dough because of it. I find this to be the most lucrative profession in the game to date.<br />
<br />
Alchemy<br />
Since herbs are no issue, I have managed to make over 100 Greater Draenic Intellect Flasks to feed my main and still have over 200 Alchemical Catalyst in the bank. I have two alchemists, but only one who is producing the flasks and pots I need for my raiding main. Because I am able to get what I need from one toon, my second alchemy alt pretty much does little to nothing with her profession.<br />
<br />
Inscription<br />
Inks are not a problem when you have 7 or more toons with the Herb Garden in their garrison. It was a struggle at first, but that was resolved the moment I leveled my herbalist-alchemist toon. I now have more than enough inks to get the daily cool-down and work orders completed on a regular basis. In fact, I found this profession nearly as lucrative as Blacksmithing, specifically in relation to the weapons and trinkets that can be crafted and sold. <br />
<br />
Engineering<br />
Once again, with the plethora of ore available to me, I have no issue maintaining a regular stream of work orders and fulfilling the daily cool-down. Since I consider this a fun profession more than a necessary one, given my main is a tailor-enchanter priest, I am neither content nor ambivalent about the changes made to professions in WoD. <br />
<br />
Summary<br />
<br />
In summary, there is clearly a disparity between professions that range from the mundane to utter frustration. The corollary is the inordinate time necessarily spent in garrisons and/or gathering materials makes for a disjointed experience, where what should be a secondary part of the game (e.g., professions) is now on the main stage requiring the attention of a high maintenance, and rather jealous, mistress. I agree that the professions in Mists were a bit over the top easy, but this expansion seems to have taken professions to a whole new level and one that isn't necessarily good for the average player. I don't think it's entirely bad, but there certainly is room for improvement. <br />
<br />
My suggestion would be to lower the yield of ore in the garrison mine, leave the garden as it is, but increase the yield of materials when farmed outside in the world (by 2 to 5 each), thus rewarding those who explore the world on a regular basis. Barns need to produce more skin and fur, even more than what can be farmed outside in the world. This should solve the scarcity issue. As far as enchanting, more time needs to pass before an objective assessment can be made. The change from getting shards to dusts was definitely a step in the right direction. And in regards to jewelcrafting, let us prospect all that ore collecting in our banks for gems, for the love of Christ! There's no reason we should need ONLY the daily cool-down and/or work orders to get the one and only gem used to cut green-quality gems. It just seems ridiculous. I can see using Taladite Crystals for blue-quality or epic gems, but not something that should be more readily available.</div></div><hr />

Because of that, it doesn't feel like I am working towards anything anymore. There's no goal at the end there, well, no obvious one. That's how it feels.</div></div><hr />

There's an easier way to do this.<br />
<br />
Get a trading post on a character with abundant garrison resources (and go ahead and use the work orders to sink extra ore and herbs, 30 resources for 5 items can be a good deal.) There are five traders, and each one has items that sell high and low-- 20 is low, 50 is high, 30 is average. Wait for the day when the trader who offers 5 fur for 20 resources comes in and use your excess resources for fur. This has one small problem-- you have to click to confirm every 5-- but it's an easy way to supply your tailoring needs.</div></div><hr />

I'm not enjoying most of them at all. And the vast disparity between crafting profession requirements (my blacksmith is easily supplied, while my LW and tailor run dry constantly) in addition to the garden/mine being basic buildings while the barn requires a medium plot and a lot of frustrating time spent trapping?

There's less reason to have them, but there's still a couple reasons that I can think of off the top of my head.<br />
<br />
1. If you have the profession, you can get the BoP crafting materials quicker via profession daily. <br />
2. This only pertains to some professions, but there's still profession specific mounts.<br />
<br />
Granted, you might not care about either of those, but personally those are two reasons why I'd want a profession.</div></div><hr />

Out of curiosity, how long have you been playing? If its been since before BC did you enjoy what was required to make and upgrade the epic weapons? I know I sure as hell did. The moment i got my drakefist hammer I was so happy. Then I went about getting the materials needed to upgrade it further. Not because I needed to but because I WANTED to. This upgrading epics isn't new shit but the way they have gone about it is borderline abusive this time.<br />
<br />
If you haven't been playing that long I can understand how you might like the way they have been utterly gutted better.</div></div><hr />

they certainly got nerfed but im still making 50-100k gold weekly just from daily cds and crafts which is really nice at this point of expansion - biggest gain is from saving gold which i was spending on crafting mats in previous expansions since this time garrison is supplying them so its pure profit. i could understand thought that they feel nerfed for people who dont run 11 alts proffs cd :)</div></div><hr />

I have been playing since launch. I just view the new system as being about the same as before. Instead of grinding out harder mats, or the like, it is all just time gated now. Same concept of waiting just a different system to get there in the end.</div></div><hr />

There's only a finite amount of mobs that you can skin. Ppl are fighting in Nagrand and other areas for either caging elites or trying to kill for leather/fur. Probably not double. But maybe about 1.5x or something like that. You not only have sooooo many herb and mining nodes out and about the world, but you GET an herb garden and mine in your Garrison. Leaving us skinners to fend for ourselves. We have to give up a spot for a Barn. And even then, the yield isn't quite on par. With what we get from Barn plus skinning in the world, miners and herbalists get more natural yield and with greater ease.</div></div><hr />

At present the only professions I have capped are alchemy twice, skinning twice, herb and mining (obviously) three times. Every other profession is sitting around 650-675 or so. I the desire these professions are just not worth it give the amount of mats need to make anything and the cd's everyday that go with them. Not really have anything besides epics in both tailoring and leather working really make them worth the time of day to make them and given this far into the raid cycle, not worth bothering to grind out mats to not really make anything off the labor it takes to grind them out. <br />
<br />
It really would have been better had Blizzard just removed them from the game for what they ended up doing to all of them. Mining is even worthless, because everyone has so much they the can skip days and weeks without in going into the mine. If the point was to make them useless, they accomplished that, if the point was to slow boat the ability to really progress or level profession to fast they achieved that as well.<br />
<br />
I think they should just complete remove them in the next expansion given what they have done to them in this one. If we are not going to have a garrison going forward, its going to be rather difficult to even level them. What is the point of even leveling them, if they are just going to make them level one patterns anyway.<br />
<br />
These profession huts are largely a joke they really do not offer the ability to really not have the actual profession. There skill set is so limited and not a lot can be done with them otherwise.<br />
<br />
It would have been nice since they no longer wanted to give the ability to level at least armor profession by making beginner pvp gear, which was usually DE anyway. They should have given the ability to make transmog sets from vanilla on up that are no longer in the game or at least given the ability to make the various piece from sets that are no longer in the game, so people could have those complete set with the right piece. Anything besides just making epic pieces of gear.</div></div><hr />

I have cooking, first-aid (because of fishing and cooking), and fishing maxed on 7 characters so far. Fishing got maxed because of Nat Pagle, otherwise it probably only be on one or two right now. <br />
<br />
Archeology will stay undone, because I only leveled it because I could fly from place to place without having to use the flight path system to do it. The FP's just don't get it when it comes to leveling this profession and the rewards are really not that great for it to take even longer now to level, its one of those profession that is nice to do when you really have nothing else to do, but it does not make or break the character(s) if not completed. Mist was nice because of having the collected pieces in the Seat of Knowledge, I know the WoD pieces are being placed in our garrison, but if the garrison is a one hit wonder, then it not really worth the investment because its not something that going with us on the journey forward past this expansion, unless of course they change their minds.<br />
<br />
Even secondary professions are not really worth the time to level. I really only do fishing to pass the time away between dungeon queues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Get a trading post on a character with abundant garrison resources (and go ahead and use the work orders to sink extra ore and herbs, 30 resources for 5 items can be a good deal.) There are five traders, and each one has items that sell high and low-- 20 is low, 50 is high, 30 is average. Wait for the day when the trader who offers 5 fur for 20 resources comes in and use your excess resources for fur. This has one small problem-- you have to click to confirm every 5-- but it's an easy way to supply your tailoring needs.<br />
<br />
This is absolutely brilliant! And I have just the alt for it, my 2nd alchemist/herbalist who is sitting on over 5,000 garrison resources. Thanks for the suggestion!!!!</div></div><hr />

I'd love to see some stats on the size of the normal (non LFR) raiding population. Both Players and Characters with data points LK, Cata, MoP and WoD. What I'm most curious about is how many players have killed a boss or two in Normal (and not LFR) nowadays as compared to pre-LFR. Proportionally (because I realize not as many people play as much anymore), are the number of people who participate in Normal or higher raids these days less or greater than before LFR? That make sense?</div></div><hr />

They should scrap all gathering professions and make them part of the main professions, you get LW and you can skin, you get enchanting you can disenchant, so it makes sense. Make going out into the world and spending a little time gathering materials to level your professions part of the game again.<br />
<br />
Essentially also my feelings about the state of professions in Warlords of Draenor.<br />
<br />
I haven't crafted a single Tailoring item on my main character. I miss the amount of crafting I did in Wrath of the Lich King for myself, my guild, and for sale on the Auction House. I disenchanted anything left over, which was great for making bags to hold my stuff. Recipes came from vendors, dropped from raids (which wasn't a problem on my realm until Cataclysm ****ed over the large pugging community). Now, more so than ever, it feels like I am fighting the game itself to be able to be a tailor. What is the point, anymore? Enchanting isn't in quite as bad a state - although Blizzard needs to address the amount of dust created from disenchanting AND revert the change to rare-quality items DE-ing into dust instead of crystals; really, not the best brainstorm there - but, again, there is an interactivity that is missing.<br />
<br />
Skip to 13:52. Although TheKephas was speaking in reference to raids and instances, I feel the principal is the same.<br />

This is how I feel, its a waste of time now. Everything I COULD sell on the AH is bound to me. Things I CAN make takes to damn long for a ridiculous sum of items. The ONLY one I enjoy now is Fishing ... and again its because I can sit down and power it out to max in a length of time designated by me, not by the creator of the game. If I want to power level a profession the same day, that should be my choice, I don't need someone telling me &quot;NO&quot; because they feel otherwise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as them being super useful early on, they honestly hit it out of the park. It's just a bit awkward now when i'm sitting here on my 670+ main with no use for it. Then looking at my 610 alt and asking myself if dumping almost 6 figures into Bloods for 3 pieces of 670 gear is a remotely good idea (hint: it's not).<br />
<br />
I'm mostly pretty happy with the core changes, but there's definitely room for improvement. I firmly believe crafting should be a core feature of any RPG type game claiming to have any depth - especially a multiplayer one, and WoW does need to go a bit further in this department. <br />
<br />
A real sore point for me is how it's kinda stink to look at all the sweet 655/665/670 BoEs floating around, many of which sell for ~10k, whereas you have to spend 5x that to get a comparable BoE from crafting. It's not quite balanced there, and i think crafting should be favoured over random crap dropping in the world. Scabbards and stuff are fine, i mean i dumped 6 figures into that because it's God tier. You get one of them to drop? GRATS. But crafting shouldn't be trumped by as many lucky drops like it is.</div></div><hr />

It is a multiple choice poll, so you might see a lot of folks with just 1 of each gathering prof, whereas enchanting/jc might be worth stacking in multiples.

logging in every day, and spending 5 seconds on your profession will naturally bring you to 700. I was getting minumum 3-4 skill points a day with inscription, just by doing my cool downs. As i said, just by doing cooldowns 3-4 skill a day. simple math over 40 days later since xpac launched that's OVER 100 skill points. this isn't including the +10 skill up's by using the mats created by the daily cooldown, and garrison buildings. So just natually doing that every day i reached 700 like 2 weeks ago on almost all my alts professions. So, your explanation of there being no benefit to being capped doesn't explain how people haven't gotten to 700 naturally by now, which is what i was suprised about in my original post.</div></div><hr />

I'm holding off on any raid stats until I am more confident we have most level 100 characters in the database. We can't really go back in time and look at kills back before LFR, as the people that were playing then are often no longer playing, so even using achievements to check wouldn't give you any useful data. You can look at SoO progression data (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3984-armory-stats-siege-of-orgrimmar-progression-blue-tweets-dlc-439) to get an idea of how many players are only doing LFR vs Normal though.</div></div><hr />

There used to be some good to them in the past, special gear, toys etc.. Now Everybody can make their gear regardless of what they actually have for a proff.<br />
<br />
The same people who were unwilling to put in the time to work professions before are the same people who are unwilling to put in the time to work professions now. When the expansion first launched, I thought the same as you did. As a Scribe, the start of an expansion is when I make the majority of my money from Darkmoon trinkets. I was very upset that anyone could get that trinket via their garrison without actually having the profession.<br />
<br />
But that fear ended up being unfounded as that didn't happen. I had no trouble making selling card and decks. As far as &quot;special&quot; items are concerned, those still exist and they absolutely require the profession to access them. Mounts for both Tailoring and Leatherworking, any and all upgrade tokens for items/armor which are still selling very well on my server, Engineering goggles still require the profession to equip them like they always have. The list goes on, but your claims simply are not true.<br />
<br />
Same goes with the complaints about having to &quot;grind&quot; the professions. Its no different than it was before. Daily CDs have existed for a long time, and the best items for professions have always required the mats from those daily CDs ever since daily CDs were introduced years ago. But now its actually faster to craft those items since you can get the mats from both your daily CD AND your appropriate garrison building. You can also buy extra with all those free Primal Spirits you get from your mine and herb garden.<br />
<br />
With max Inscription I make 10 War Paints a day from my daily CD. I get another 12 per day from my Scribe's Quarter with a follower. So it takes a whopping 5 days to make a basic item, but without my garrison it would take twice that long. All of that still only requires I log in once per day to get those materials, so there is no more grinding now in WoD than before.<br />
<br />
A lot less actually. No more having to grind reputations in order to buy formulas or patterns. I was also able to drop Herbalism as my garrison provides all the herbs I need. No more spending a couple hours each week fighting with other people for nodes. Even with everyone having access to an herb garden, I still easily sell ink on the AH. With free herbs available to everyone, people are still unwilling to gather them in order to get their own crafting mats.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mandatory how? Highmaul drops better gear than the crafted upgrades. My main is a 671 Warlock and I have not crafted or purchased a single upgraded item. I had some of the basic crafted items, but replaced them all from Highmaul. Anyone using an upgraded crafted item does so out of personal choice, but there is absolutely no need for them.<br />
<br />
Yes not everyone raids at the same level, but those people who are not in a serious raiding guild need those upgraded items even less. They may want them, but they don't need them. So yes, people will still buy them, but its no different than any other crafted item. You are either willing to put in the time to craft them, or you are going to have to buy them from the people who do put in the time.</div></div><hr />

The exceptions would be jewelcrafting and enchanting, which suffer from a lack of resources in one way or another. ,<br />
<br />
&lt;snip&gt;<br />
<br />
Summary<br />
<br />
In summary, there is clearly a disparity between professions that range from the mundane to utter frustration. The corollary is the inordinate time necessarily spent in garrisons and/or gathering materials makes for a disjointed experience, where what should be a secondary part of the game (e.g., professions) is now on the main stage requiring the attention of a high maintenance, and rather jealous, mistress. I agree that the professions in Mists were a bit over the top easy, but this expansion seems to have taken professions to a whole new level and one that isn't necessarily good for the average player. I don't think it's entirely bad, but there certainly is room for improvement. <br />
<br />
My suggestion would be to lower the yield of ore in the garrison mine, leave the garden as it is, but increase the yield of materials when farmed outside in the world (by 2 to 5 each), thus rewarding those who explore the world on a regular basis. Barns need to produce more skin and fur, even more than what can be farmed outside in the world. This should solve the scarcity issue. As far as enchanting, more time needs to pass before an objective assessment can be made. The change from getting shards to dusts was definitely a step in the right direction. And in regards to jewelcrafting, let us prospect all that ore collecting in our banks for gems, for the love of Christ! There's no reason we should need ONLY the daily cool-down and/or work orders to get the one and only gem used to cut green-quality gems. It just seems ridiculous. I can see using Taladite Crystals for blue-quality or epic gems, but not something that should be more readily available.<br />
<br />
Good post. As mentioned, if you are playing alot (4 or more hours everyday), you end with lots of mats relative to the people who play just 1-2 hours a day, max.<br />
They need to increase yield of special mats such as Taladite crystals because it can literally take 2-3 days just to get mats for one blue gem.<br />
<br />
I also suggest that players be given a choice to go for special buildings (Salvage yard, pet menagerie, mines, fishing shack and garden at each point instead of the fixed path. so that if I want herb garden first, i get it first.<br />
<br />
Another thing that really needs to be considered is reducing gold prices of some mounts, plans, rep rewards (5000 gold for a follower..like what?), even the flying training costs because this is what annoys me now. Its way too grindy. Saving gold or having to play AH just to get things at a reasonable pace is not fun. I mean you can play BGs, Arenas, do dungeons, pet battles, do quests etc, there IS a lot of content, but it takes way too much time to buy some of the rewards if you try to do both these things at the same time. <br />

I don't blame you for not leveling archaeology, but your reasoning is flawed. One, it actually levels ridiculously fast. They countered the no-flying by adding more dig spots to each site. You can level from 600-700 in probably just little over an hour at most if you're diligent. Especially if you get lucky with a lot of Nagrand digsites and you have the corral outpost - no dismounting while archaeologalizing is amazing. Also, about the displaying artifacts, well, it's no more pointless than the Seat of Knowledge displays. They may not continue with the garrison in the future, but it isn't going to disappear. Sure, you're not going to go there anymore in the future, but how often are you frequenting the Seat of Knowledge these days? Probably not very often.<br />

Gathering professions are completely useless now that you can pick materials from your labor camp even without having that profession. I myself have tailoring and enchanting. Enchanting is downright laughable now. You can only use 4 enchants in gear above 600ilvl yet i have book full of enchants. <br />
<br />
Stupid changes continuing with blizzards path of simplifying and dumbing down the game to a point when it becomes phone app.</div></div><hr />

It's mental in fact. <br />
<br />
The removal of personal advantages from professions made them mostly worthless. The only few useful profs are now Alchemy (dominantly) with JC and enchanting to some extent. I also have to say that the daily prof CDs are very annoying especially since only some professions are able to market their daily materials on the auction house, rest of us are pretty stuck with them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes because it was so hard to predict, that a good number of players managed to foresee the disaster before beta hit in, yet Blizzard stubbornly insisted, yet again, that they found the one true path and their vision is, as always, awesome. <br />
<br />
It's quite evident most of the devs do not play the game regularly which results in ideas being pulled out of their backsides with absolutely no forethought, be it professions, class design, pvp.<br />
<br />
The only department that deserves praise for this xpac are the artists, as always, and the encounter designers. That would be it. <br />
<br />
Everyone else could use being forced to play the crap delivered for 4 hours a day till the end of the xpac, progress 'as intended' through all levels of content. Maybe then they'd gain some insight. I'd start from the top, with the lead designer. <br />
<br />
The lack of vision for the game as a whole is appalling. There is no synergy between old and new, there are no attempts to correct what does not work and make it flow with the game as a whole. Things are being thrown in and pulled out every xpac with little reflection on what went wrong and how to avoid a similar situation in the future. Not to mention the arrogant attitude and never , ever admitting to maybe not the most fortunate choices resulting in very little respect from the playerbase.</div></div><hr />

When the expansion first launched, I thought the same as you did. As a Scribe, the start of an expansion is when I make the majority of my money from Darkmoon trinkets. I was very upset that anyone could get that trinket via their garrison without actually having the profession.<br />
<br />
But that fear ended up being unfounded as that didn't happen. I had no trouble making selling card and decks. As far as &quot;special&quot; items are concerned, those still exist and they absolutely require the profession to access them. Mounts for both Tailoring and Leatherworking, any and all upgrade tokens for items/armor which are still selling very well on my server, Engineering goggles still require the profession to equip them like they always have. The list goes on, but your claims simply are not true.<br />
<br />
Same goes with the complaints about having to &quot;grind&quot; the professions. Its no different than it was before. Daily CDs have existed for a long time, and the best items for professions have always required the mats from those daily CDs ever since daily CDs were introduced years ago. But now its actually faster to craft those items since you can get the mats from both your daily CD AND your appropriate garrison building. You can also buy extra with all those free Primal Spirits you get from your mine and herb garden.<br />
<br />
With max Inscription I make 10 War Paints a day from my daily CD. I get another 12 per day from my Scribe's Quarter with a follower. So it takes a whopping 5 days to make a basic item, but without my garrison it would take twice that long. All of that still only requires I log in once per day to get those materials, so there is no more grinding now in WoD than before.<br />
<br />
A lot less actually. No more having to grind reputations in order to buy formulas or patterns. I was also able to drop Herbalism as my garrison provides all the herbs I need. No more spending a couple hours each week fighting with other people for nodes. Even with everyone having access to an herb garden, I still easily sell ink on the AH. With free herbs available to everyone, people are still unwilling to gather them in order to get their own crafting mats.<br />
<br />
Those daily cooldowns you are talking about could be circumvented partially with a transmute master for additional mats. This time around people who chose transmute mastery got shafted, hard. Same goes for potion or flask mastery. those are worthless now. PLUS, those daily cooldown could be sold or given to another toon to be used in crafting something. Thats not an option now unless I want to waste a garrison plot on a building that requires ores frm the obligatory mine you get. this can be added to with an actual miner. I want items my BS can make that people actually NEED like something to add sockets to gear like we had at one point, remember? But no, this time we have to hope RNG favors us with an epic with sockets otherwise its right back to raiding hoping the same item drops with sockets repeat ad nauseum.<br />

Lest we forget we will not have our garrison come next expac.</div></div><hr />

There's no more cutting gems, it's crafting gems. Taladite gems are crafted from crap and not cut from a Taladite gem. Greater Taladite gems are cut but with extra crap... Prospecting is non-existent even though True Iron Ore shows &quot;Prospectable&quot; in the tool tip. Shouldn't jewellery crafted from Jewel Crafting contain gems crafted as well? Nope, more random ore to make jewellery. Ruined!<br />
<br />
Giving every single character the ability to mine and pick herbs in their Garrisons?! Now there's no value in having those professions in this expansion.<br />
<br />
Changing the items that can be enchanted and preventing older enchants from being used on new gear? Why!?<br />
<br />
In general based on the professions I have, I'd say Blizzard screwed up when it comes to professions for this expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to agree, I have never been a hardcore raider or PVP although I have dabbled with both,<br />
<br />
The one thing I did do though was level alts and have all the professions Maxed including Secondary professions,<br />
<br />
It was a achievement for me, now I have people in my guild who never had a maxed profession now telling me about how much gold there making etc<br />
<br />
and the amount of mats on the AH just makes me sad, the AH on the server were I play is flooded with crafted gear mats etc , I have never struggled before to make gold, now I am.<br />
<br />
For me Blizzard have taken the idea of the farm in MOP and just let it go totally out of control with no thought on the effects in the game economy. What is the point of Transmutation or Elixir or Flask, Prospecting, They say dont buy gold because it ruins the game economy this has done more to harm the game economy then gold buying, <br />
<br />
I dont want to play farmville in wow anymore.<br />
<br />
Totally Ruined it for me.</div></div><hr />
