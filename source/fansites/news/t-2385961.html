Battle for Azeroth - Spells and the Global Cooldown<br />
I wanted to provide feedback on a change that went out in today's build (26297). All DPS and HPS cooldowns are now on the GCD. This includes WIngs and Seraphim for Paladins, Trueshot for Hunters, Battlecry for Warrior, etc. to name a few. This appears to be a change that affects every class.<br />
<br />
This is a bad change because its very awkward and I urge Blizzard to revert this. I spent some time on a Paladin today on Alpha and it felt super strange to hit Wings or Sera when I wanted too without them activating. I was usually was in the middle of a GCD and had to keep mashing my keybind so it would activate as soon it could. WoW has a very responsive combat system so when I hit an ability like this, I would like it to trigger at the time of the initial button press, not when the next GCD is open. If defensive cooldowns like Ardent Defender are still off the GCD, then their burst damage/healing counterparts should also be off the GCD as a matter of balance and consistency. I can only imagine how this feels for classes and specs that depend on their CDs more heavily like a Mage. If you play one of these classes or specs, please speak up.<br />
Thank you for the feedback. This set of changes reflects an experiment in the latest Alpha build. Some context and explanation follows.<br />
<br />
The &quot;global cooldown&quot; was so named because it originally was nearly universal. In the early days of WoW, virtually all abilities were on the GCD, with some of the only exceptions being &quot;on next swing&quot; attacks like the old Heroic Strike and Maul, which didn't have an immediate effect when activated. For melee players especially, with mostly instant abilities, the global cooldown was the metronome that governed the rhythm and pacing of WoW combat, including the agile Rogue being able to act more quickly than others. But over the years, more and more abilities have been taken off the GCD, to the point that, depending on class, spec, and talent choice, it's possible in Legion for someone to have 10+ abilities in their spellbook that ignore the &quot;global&quot; cooldown. <br />
<br />
Recently, we took a step back and surveyed the landscape of what did and didn't respect the GCD, looking to justify each of these decisions anew. This process is still ongoing, and further changes may come.<br />
<br />
Aside from setting the overall pacing of combat, abilities being on the global cooldown can create potentially interesting choices: If you're in an arena match and are low on health being melee attacked, but so is your target on the enemy team, do you use your next GCD to try to finish off your opponent, or to get yourself out of harm's way? That's a nuanced decision, where a skilled and experienced player is more likely to intuitively make the right read of the situation. If your defensive/escape tool is off the GCD, then there is no decision: You simply do both.<br />
<br />
But on the other hand, taking something off the GCD improves responsiveness, and opens up avenues of reactive gameplay. Until Wrath of the Lich King, most spell interrupts were on the global cooldown. Back then, someone tasked with interrupting a boss (Reliquary of Souls in Black Temple was notorious in this regard) would often stop using any abilities at all when it was their turn in the rotation, lest they find themselves on cooldown and unable to interrupt. That's technically a decision, but more of a nuisance than a satisfying choice. Similarly, trying to use Lay on Hands to save the day in response to a sudden dip in your tank's health, only to have the spell fail to cast because you'd executed a standard part of your rotation a half-second prior, simply felt bad. We have no plans to put either of those abilities back on the GCD.<br />
<br />
This brings us to a broad category of abilities that are off the GCD in Legion: Offensive burst cooldowns. These are almost always pre-planned and not generally used in response to an unexpected situation. With them off the GCD, talenting into such abilities often just becomes a matter of adding another line to a burst macro without any additional gameplay as a result. In endgame raid and dungeon situations, stacking all possible cooldowns has an outsized impact on someone’s total performance, while in PvP, the fact that major damage amplifiers can be applied simultaneously with an outgoing damage ability (e.g. Battle Cry/Recklessness -&gt; Avatar -&gt; Mortal Strike) heavily limits counterplay and makes worst-case burst damage more severe. <br />
<br />
Thus, we're putting most activated offensive cooldowns, along with On Use offensive trinkets, back on the GCD. We will tune these effects around this change (see, for example, the increase to the duration of Recklessness in the latest Alpha build). Abilities like the Elemental shaman's Stormkeeper have demonstrated that an offensive cooldown that takes the place of another spell (and even has a cast time) can still feel very potent. <br />
<br />
Finally, while we wouldn't make a gameplay change solely for this reason, there is some additional upside to being able to better telegraph the activation of a major cooldown via animation and visuals. For example, Battle Cry/Recklessness has a warcry animation associated with it, but in practice that visual is virtually never seen, since it's usually overriden by an attack animation milliseconds later. <br />
<br />
When you're used to a specific ability being off the GCD, there is some learned muscle memory that will make for a jarring experience when that changes. Or abilities that have always been macroed together may now need to be split out into two separate keybinds. Thus, we realize that initial reactions to the change are likely to be mixed at best. But we're making these changes with an eye towards long-term improvement to the pacing and feel of combat, as outlined above. <br />
<br />
Please play around with these changes, and let us know what you think: Are there any specific offensive cooldowns that we've changed in this build that feel especially bad? Are there any abilities that are still off the GCD but don't need to be?<br />

Correct me if im wrong but some classes are changing in alpha and getting away from ''vulnerable windows'' were you unload all your stuff, also I played during wrath and only few abilities were off the GDC back then so it's no biggie for me but I can understand why some players will hate the change.</div></div><hr />

Pre-WC3, the Sunwell was a font of arcane energy (leading to the high elves getting glowing-blue eyes). Then as part of their backstory in TBC, the blood elves began turning to fel magic, and while most blood elves didn't actively partake, there was enough fel energy in Quel'Thalas that mild corruption in the form of green eyes happened. Now the Sunwell is running on a Naaru heart, infusing it with the Light, and the blood elves have been on M'uru's Advanced Detox Program since retaking the Sunwell. I'd be surprised if this didn't also manifest in the high elves, unless the high elves become void elves en masse to follow Alleria's example, and to combat their flagging numbers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And frankly it's inelegant. Now these spells actually do something other than just act as a dps boost, but it still feels clunky having to line them up in this manner. If any class is in a position where they have to spend 3 GCDs, or more if they have a trinket, that class is going to feel like shit. If they're short term cooldowns it'll be even more tedious.<br />
<br />
Of course, class abilities are getting trimmed down, but if that's the case the stacking shouldn't really be an issue. <br />

This could be really bad though for specs like Unholy DK who already have 10 abilities they have to activate at the start of their rotation. This could also be really bad in PVP in terms of feeling like you can never kill anyone due to all the defensive cooldowns being off the GCD. I personally got sick of battlegrounds when it took 5-6 people to focus down one healer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First, who cares about how it affects PVP. If those people don't like bursty gameplay or want they want them to have to make Important Decisions based on the GCD (boring), then make different rules for PVP and PVE - we already have major differences now between the two anyway.<br />
<br />
Second, putting offensive CDs on the GCD does NOT &quot;slow down&quot; gameplay. All it does is make you feel like you're wading through molasses when you push your buttons. For something like Wings, we're talking about something you use once every 2 minutes... so it has no real effect on gameplay speed. Popping a CD is supposed to be FUN and rewarding, and I love building up HoPo, waiting until right before I'm going to Templars Verdict, and then hitting wings as I use TV. It's a fun combination and makes starting the CD a little more fun and nuanced.<br />
<br />
I actually think more things should be removed from the GCD. Defensive CDs like ice block and bubble should be off the GCD because dying to the GCD boss is stupid and not-fun and isn't even something you can plan for.</div></div><hr />

Blue high elf eyes (and underwear) are available on the Blood Elf model. You don't see those available for player creation. Same with Eredar skins.

Odd since these, technically, don't exist. The blue-eyed blood elves tend to be the ones who left Lordaeron before the Sunwell got nuked and weren't addicted, hence they didn't tap into fel magic. Those are actually called High Elves though; and they don't quite exist in masses (close to extinction), plus it's rather difficult to recruit more (as opposed to Void Elves).</div></div><hr />

Therein lies the problem.. ability bloat. Not saying we need BC one button wonder locks or arcane mages again but the feel of some core abilities just seems overshadowed when there are so many sources of damage. I remember them saying something one time about all the sources of damage Enh had and wanted to tune it down... well look what legion did and for a whole xpac dks end talents were only utility... Im all for slowing the game down honestly. I think haste was the worst thing they ever added. I want core abilities to mean more/do more. Not over 9000 wet noodle strikes. If they want to do the class fantasy they really did it wrong. An arms war shouldn't have an higher AMP than any rogue/cat/monk/enh etc</div></div><hr />

Is this everyones first time using the model viewer? They've been there as long has blood elves and have been marked unplayable in the client for just as long. Theres also Eredar customization options for draenei and Wildhammer for dwarves, they've been in there for ages to help blizzard make NPC's. <br />
Its why some private servers have them, because it's just as simple as flipping a switch to make them options and that's a switch blizzard hasn't touched in 11 years, the draenei have the WoD horns in it too but they made a whole new race instead of just enabling it for players. The golden eyes might be but the blue eyes are as old as time and they'll be a new race before they become a customization option.<br />
The golden eyes will probably be an option for this whole light and void theme they're going for fun because there is no void in this expansion, just good old fashioned Alliance vs Horde. There is no war in Ba Sing Void.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Their stated reasons are rather weak. Wanting to allow players to &quot;play around&quot; other people using offensive GCDs for PvP isn't interesting at all. Its a nuisance. It adds nothing to the game. Being able to macro together Bloodbath, Blood Fury, Avatar, and Battlecry onto 1 button hurts no one. Honestly its just button bloat.<br />
<br />
I cannot follow their reasoning that throwing offensives on GCD would impact large dungeon pulls or raids at all. Its simply not going to work. Say you have a 10 second 30% DMG buff on GCD, and an 8 second 30% haste buff on GCD, you will still want to stack your offensives. If even short duration burst CDs you just pop them second (Avatar into Battlecry/recklessness). The only thing this really impacts is classes using 3 or more burst CDs that have less than 10 second windows.<br />
<br />
Go ahead and ask any disc priest on Live how annoying it is that you cannot macro together Evangelism with Velens because of Envangelism's GCD. It doesn't add any skill to the game to need yet another keybind. Its just button bloat.<br />

<br />
I would be fine with this if all we had for every class was 1 offensive CD, but we have many many more. And not only that we have trinkets, that will now be on GCD. It all seems we will be forced to go from CD stacking to spreading them out, or if there's a talent choice, pick the passive one. Mage/Warrior will probably be the biggest to suffer, Mage because they've always been burst oriented and Warrior because they have so many CDs and Battly Cry CD is really short.<br />
<br />
It really seems there is no good choice if they globally force GCDs back like this, it will likely lead to either more pruning, which itself feels really shit.. Or us having to deal with it, which ruins the fluidity of the gameplay.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love this, why? Because everyone says. &quot;Don't change it, that is the way it was&quot; well then it should be changed. Cause it was like this in vanilla BC and wrath. Mid wrath they started removing stuff from gcd into late data<br />
<br />
So if they didn't change this, these would always be on GCD.<br />
And this is a good change. It will make them more of a epic moment, you cast it and the duration will be increased to compensate as they said. But it will allow you to see the animation, prep yourself. And move from you &quot;cooldown&quot; keybinds to your &quot;spam DPS&quot; keybinds. <br />
Also this is big in PvP, it stops the &quot;I use a cooldown then instantly hit you with my strongest spell&quot; this gives people a prep time. Stopping the massive burst. No more &quot;ok he is about to hit me with a 5 combo point.&quot; *dead* oh turns out he popped 4 cooldowns all at once eith no warning then hit the combo point...<br />
<br />
I like the change and can't wait to see it fully implemented. It will slow down combat and make these epic buffs and effects feel more important since it isn't just bank instant and done. Would be cool to even some be cast like demonic empowerment (not in the like &quot;use all the time&quot; but the use it then go all out)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MasterHamster</div><div class="date">2018-03-24, 09:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Increase duration a bit to offset and it's no big deal. WoWs combat has gone to the point where it feels so smooth it lacks any real impact. The game has gone far, far too close to an ARPG. People complain that an activated ability can't be seamlessly woven in? Then the game has bred the wrong expectations. That as soon as a trinket or CD is ready it should more or less auto-activate, with zero drawback.<br />
<br />
Changes like this can indeed improve it, even though as usual, players will just see it as a nerf and complain. Yes, it will feel a bit clunky, because you're used to not having to care about the GCD. The fix is to increase duration a bit, not to revert the change.<br />
<br />
There's a lot of things in &quot;modern&quot; WoW that has created this idea that everything in the game should be like a silk-wipe gently helping you through everything, and anything players don't like should instantly be removed. Part of what makes a game fun is the obstacles, hurdles and the &quot;issues&quot; so you have something to figure out and overcome. And yes, even tiny things like whether a cooldown is on a GCD or not is relevant there, because if your damage burst abilities isn't on a GCD or have any other drawback, it's a no-brainer that doesn't really enhance the experience. <br />
<br />
This is however just a minor thing when it comes to WoWs current issue of how fact paced it is. And when you play a &quot;slow&quot; class or leveling, it really feels like a handicap. I'll use an example of playing a lowbie mage in a dungeon, at least before 7.3.5, and even regular cast spells feels &quot;clunky&quot; because the melee and tank are obliterating everything before you can barely have time to cast anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hGQ97tCTOs<br />
(I will probably be playing this when I change at least my pally to those golden eyes)<br />
<br />
As for the whole blue eyes/green eyes/golden eyes discussion, it's a hard one, the blue eyes come from the old arcane powered Sunwell, when they lost that and started tapping into the Fel to feed their addiction, those who did had their eyes turn green over a short period of time, but the Sunwell has been restored, and it's been restored by holy magic, not arcane, and the practice of tapping from fel magic and demons is gone, so yes the green Blood Elf eyes should be gold now, all of them, but can you make that kind of a sweeping change across a race, have all their eyes turn gold, something that impacts a player characters look that much?<br />
<br />
Same goes for the blue eyed High Elves really, the Sunwell has been restored, but do they have to reconnect with it in some physical or magical way or would they automatically have that connection again? And when they have that connection again wouldn't their eyes turn gold as well over time as well?<br />
<br />
So in that regard shouldn't most Blood Elves and High Elves be golden eyed at this point?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not the case, it's originally, but it's retconned long ago.<br />
<br />
The majority of Belves had never practised or even known about Fel magic. The only exposure to Fel they actually experienced was due to Rommath's and his magisters' usage of it to rebuilt Quel'Thalas. Being close to Fel sources turned their eyes green.<br />
<br />
Also lore-wise Helves can have natural blue, green, red and even purple eyes :p In another thread I quoted ToD book, where it's stated that Alleria, for instance, had natural emerald green eyes.<br />
<br />
-- edit #1<br />
<br />
Here:<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, lore-wise there's Helves w/ green eyes and Belves w/ blue eyes, eye colour is not definitive, the split is ideological, not physiological. You don't have to do anything yourself to get green eyes, just hang out around Fel sources long enough, and your eyes will turn green. You don't have to be a Fel magic practitioner.<br />
<br />
Moreover, old lore also stated that green eye colour occurred naturally, for instance, in ToD books Alleria had naturally green eyes, some Helves had purple and even red eyes.<br />
<br />
<br />
She nodded, covering the remaining distance and stopping only a handspan away. From here he could see the pointed ears poking up through her hair, and the wide, emerald-green eyes that slanted up at the corners. ―I am Alleria Windrunner, and I bring you greetings from Anasterian Sunstrider and the Council of Silvermoon. Her voice was lovely, musical and rich, and Lothar suspected it was pleasant even in anger.<br />
<br />
But in WoW Helves have blue eyes and Belves have only green eyes for gameplay reasons :p</div></div><hr />

Odd since these, technically, don't exist. The blue-eyed blood elves tend to be the ones who left Lordaeron before the Sunwell got nuked and weren't addicted, hence they didn't tap into fel magic. Those are actually called High Elves though; and they don't quite exist in masses (close to extinction), plus it's rather difficult to recruit more (as opposed to Void Elves).<br />

Oh I think that Void Elves would have assimilated all High Elves by now, so there are only a handful of Silver Covenant NPCs left. They have to get all the player characters from somewhere. :D<br />

<br />
Their stated reasons are rather weak. Wanting to allow players to &quot;play around&quot; other people using offensive GCDs for PvP isn't interesting at all. Its a nuisance. It adds nothing to the game. Being able to macro together Bloodbath, Blood Fury, Avatar, and Battlecry onto 1 button hurts no one. Honestly its just button bloat.<br />
<br />
I cannot follow their reasoning that throwing offensives on GCD would impact large dungeon pulls or raids at all. Its simply not going to work. Say you have a 10 second 30% DMG buff on GCD, and an 8 second 30% haste buff on GCD, you will still want to stack your offensives. If even short duration burst CDs you just pop them second (Avatar into Battlecry/recklessness). The only thing this really impacts is classes using 3 or more burst CDs that have less than 10 second windows.<br />
<br />
Go ahead and ask any disc priest on Live how annoying it is that you cannot macro together Evangelism with Velens because of Envangelism's GCD. It doesn't add any skill to the game to need yet another keybind. Its just button bloat.<br />
<br />
Also Blizzard, can you give ONE example where you would not want to stack offensive burst CDs in PvE?<br />
<br />
When the boss has more than one DPS check and your CDs won't be available for the second if you use them both on the first. You may need to split them out so you have CDs for both in order to make the checks.</div></div><hr />

Ahh CANT WAIT to get back the old feel of combat. Having half my abilities off GCD feels horrible, no planning required just smash your buttons when you want/can.<br />
Having some skill included in combat again is an awesome change. It will change nothing in PvE since pressig those wings every couple minutes rly isnt any different with or without GCD. But in PvP it makes all the difference. Thank you Blizzard. Hopefully they will take as much off the cooldown and balance the classes around it.<br />

<br />
They didn't make these changes because they &quot;realized&quot; it was too fast for normal people. Read the actual post. <br />
<br />
Not all raiders play &quot;24/7&quot;. You're generalizing by comparing us to an extremely small percent of players. <br />
<br />
Just because people may (I don't) like slower gameplay during leveling does not mean they want slower gameplay in their end-game. <br />
<br />
WoW never felt like Dark Souls. The philosophy behind game development should and is &quot;easy to learn, difficult to master&quot;. You're not supposed to slow down the pace of a successful and skill based system to cater to people who can't or don't want to learn because they think &quot;yer cun onlee be gud by do play 24/7!&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
The GCD change is centered around balancing, animations and an attempt at giving players decision making procees as opposed to a set rule that applies to multiple situations. This doesn't mean you're going to suddenly be good because having CDs off GCD was making you bad. <br />
<br />
There are certain classes like Rogues where this will feel very clunky. Vendetta off GCD? Shadow Dance off GCD when we already know how awful that was?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did you not read the part where they are deciding what does and doesn't go on GCD?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crookids</div><div class="date">2018-03-26, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you not read the part where they are deciding what does and doesn't go on GCD?<br />
<br />
Yes. Did you?<br />
<br />
<br />
This brings us to a broad category of abilities that are off the GCD in Legion: Offensive burst cooldowns. These are almost always pre-planned and not generally used in response to an unexpected situation. With them off the GCD, talenting into such abilities often just becomes a matter of adding another line to a burst macro without any additional gameplay as a result. In endgame raid and dungeon situations, stacking all possible cooldowns has an outsized impact on someone’s total performance, while in PvP, the fact that major damage amplifiers can be applied simultaneously with an outgoing damage ability (e.g. Battle Cry/Recklessness -&gt; Avatar -&gt; Mortal Strike) heavily limits counterplay and makes worst-case burst damage more severe. <br />
<br />
Thus, we're putting most activated offensive cooldowns, along with On Use offensive trinkets, back on the GCD. We will tune these effects around this change (see, for example, the increase to the duration of Recklessness in the latest Alpha build). Abilities like the Elemental shaman's Stormkeeper have demonstrated that an offensive cooldown that takes the place of another spell (and even has a cast time) can still feel very potent.</div></div><hr />
