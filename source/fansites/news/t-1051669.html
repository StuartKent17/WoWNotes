From Blizzard ofc. mmo-champion is Blizzard's advertisement. Only Blizzard would have these kind of stats available. They didn't say sample size or anything about how data was collected so would be logical to assume it is Blizzard internal numbers or just made up.</div></div><hr />

The same way we do for all of our other similar posts, take the data from a large sample of level 85 characters on armory. If you are interested in doing something similar / how to collect similar data, see http://blizzard.github.com/api-wow-docs/</div></div><hr />

No they don't, it's cause TBC had the proper design team in place, which later got shifted over /fired to other games for Blizzard..</div></div><hr />

I am sure I like many hate it when gear becomes more homogenized looking like the classes over time and the game in terms of playing it. You look at old weapons and they looked to have &quot;made sense&quot; for swinging them, not just decorative pieces used to wear or hit people with. Talk about the katana looking swords, and smooth looking armor, without the bulging over-sized shoulders, giant belts, overly flamboyant other armor slots. Some people just want to keep the more traditional looks, not walking disco players or to just be unique (which being unique says nothing bad when players get older gear to achieve it over new content).</div></div><hr />

I agree. I just stopped playing WoW (after a long 5+ years) as a result of burnout and boredom with the highend raiding (thanks, firelands). Watching this video, frankly, made me glad I did. Congrats for the world first but goddamn does this look boring. With no prior knowledge of the fight beyond this video, it looks to me like &quot;burst down this tentacle. Now, move away and burst down this tentacle&quot; for 15 mins straight in a race against how often you yawn and scratch yourself. I don't mean to sound like an ahole intent on badmouthing the game, but wtf Blizz? Is this tier as boring as this video indicates? I'm sure the dps/hps required is as tightly tuned as we'd expect from an end boss, but the mechanics seems as challenging as not nicking my nuts while shaving them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed. As a Combat Rogue I have no offhand choices for current content (daggers only), so I'm in the same boat.<br />
<br />
See how the most common weapon for Rogues used in transmogrification is one that shares a model with a sword? I wish Blizzard would get the hint and at least allow dagger &lt;-&gt; 1H sword transmogrification like bows, guns, and crossbows. :mad:</div></div><hr />

TBCs weapons have colour and creativity, while being really easy to obtain.<br />
Wrath of the Lich Kings weapons are really dark and boring. Skulls and death everywhere.<br />
Cataclysms weapons have some good ones, but as they are all quite new everyone already have seen them resently and the weapons due to that lack any kind of uniqueness.<br />
<br />
These are my reasons of why things are as they are.</div></div><hr />

Second - The lack of love for classic 60 pvp gear is due to the &quot;you had to be there&quot; part of the ability to transmog them. Vanilla pvp gear can only be transmoged to with the feat of strength. So you need to have been playing at least 5 years+ and on top of that to go Area 52 and not stormwind/orgrimmar to pick up the gear that can be used for transmog. I am a fan of the vanilla sets with the grandmarshall dagger and a few misc pieces which are amazingly from cata (cloak/belt/offhand)</div></div><hr />

Maybe its not about Blizzard being lazy but the fight looks like a joke to me compared to other fights like &lt;list urs here&gt;.<br />

DPS needs to burst things down fast enough so the raid doesn't wipe/ the tank doesn't die, rather than only making things impossibru for healers or tanks for once... Instead of moving out of fire, they now have to prevent a fire (in a manner of speaking). Deathwing as a whole (spine and Madness) is very cool to me and an interesting approach, as I've grown a bit tired of avoiding tail swipes, cleave and fire breaths... And let's be honest, if Deathwing did a tailswipe, he'd have taken out dwarven district aswell.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Samin</div><div class="date">2011-12-26, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the reason why so many people transmog to TBC gear is because TBC allowed raiding for less hardcore players, so that's where many players got into raiding even those who already played during vanilla but never raided seriously back then. So TBC is where many players have their first raid experiences, the fond memories of learning the mechanics of the game, playing together with friends and finally getting those tier pieces. All those memories are attached to that, so of course people see those sets as superior.On the other hand, despite the fact that not everyone like the dark/death style of wotlk gear, especially ICC has the bad memories attached that it lasted for ages. That makes the gear look less attractive too.This gets especially clear with vanilla gear. It just looks bad compared to even TBC gear (to not even start with post-ulduar hi-res gear). It's mostly the memories attached to it from the times back than. But don't let that devalue the choice for it. It's just that most of the time the choice is not done because the gear was &quot;better&quot; back then but because it has some emotional value to you. I agree that there are few exceptions like the thematic sets like shaman T1 or druid T2 where the way it fits the lore of the class can make up for the lack of quality for the eye.Personally I always liked to see my paladin more as a only-necessarily-lawful-good knight rather than a lawful good zealous inquisitor. I like T2, but I always prefered D3 (TBC-Heroics) over T2 and T6. I even liked the white T8 much more than those. But alliance-paladin T9 just fits the best for what I imagine of my paladin. But I think for paladin most peopel still reforge to T2 or T6 because they either think of a zealous retributor (T2) or a holy justicator(T6). That also affects the weapon choice simply because they have to fit the style of the set, so just look at it. The first 3 weapons match T2, the last two fit T6.I personally use Quel'Delar because Iit does have an emotional value for me as a non-raider back then as a (relatively) powerful weapon that I used for the rest of the expansion (I got it the night before they nerfed the drop from non-elites). So to me it just looks really awesome and I'm unable to to give it a fair judge because of those rose-tinted glasses. (Even though I'm reasonable enough to *not* use it for my D3 transmogged set, not that I could because it's tank..but even if I could I wouldn't)</div></div><hr />

Why would someone transmog into newish gear they JUST had rather than transmog into gear they haven't worn in years.<br />
<br />
Lol, let's transmog hand of rag into hand of rag! hahahaha<br />
<br />
But really, who'll transmog the gear he just used for, maybe, months again? Transmog works the other way, new is the old, old is the new.<br />
<br />
I can see only a few cases for cata weapon transmog like the 2hand archaeology sword that someone took ages to finally get when 359 is crap and then he just transmog that shit everywhere because he's really pissed for the time wasted lol or Sulfuras that only seems to drop after warmaster dropped his 397 mace, etc. lol<br />
<br />
Altough we're talking about weapons, I do transmog my cata armor with cata armor models. For example, one can finally use matching belt/boots for his T12 ret paladin set instead of DK's belt/boots, or DK's belt for his DK tank tier set, etc. I'm doing that kind of transmog now to &quot;fix&quot; my Tier sets.</div></div><hr />

Differences I've noticed: <br />
1 new add during tentacle, they kill him before he casts, I'm guessing its lethal if he casts. <br />
And phase 2, bloods spawn and rush to deathwing to heal him.<br />
<br />
I expected more changes to him than this... Maybe there are, but hey the tight enrage makes it a huge dps and healing intense encounter. Excellent kill.</div></div><hr />

You know why BC dominates? Because most of the content is easily done in small groups or even solo. Brutal gladiator weapons look decent and cost about 1-2 BGs worth of honor. Classic is, despite lower level, less available than BC content. Lingering attunements, mostly ugly weapons (save for some in BWL) and the &quot;t1 t2 = best ever&quot; craze is miniscule at best. WotLK is somewhat available thanks to ICC mount/achievement runs, but few transmog into Cata weapons since there's little novelty in transmogging to another &quot;current&quot; weapon. We'll see cata weapons in MoP instead, with pvp weapons either Wrathful (LK)or Ruthless. Making this into another &quot;see, BC is better than Cata&quot;-discussion is just sad. BC had it's good points, I find it funny though that BC, which was first to introduce arenas, flying mounts (RUINED WORLD PVP) and had to use gating techniques to slow people down in raid progression is seen as the best expansion, but hey, that's nostalgia for ya. Forget the bad, cherish the good. Always complain about the present, eh?</div></div><hr />

The most popular item doesn't mean that's the item that people like the most but rather that people like it plus it's easy available to them, they might really like a item that has less than 10% drop change and have been grinding that for some time but haven't had that yet. Second that's only the top 5 items and we have had 4 expansion* (if you count vanilla as an expansion, which it isn't). So that Cata doesn't have any on the top five isn't such a big deal, because yes that's only 5 items. Also people just recently have cata items so they are recently bored with them plus some people haven't even transformed their current cata gear and they don't show up on the list.</div></div><hr />

I honestly don't believe any of the &quot;older models were better&quot; crap. They weren't, they just have a different style. This i actually a good thing, because you can mix and match styles quite neatly, and often I even find BC models to just look like utter crap.

<br />
No, wrong. They are harder for the top guilds, yes. But for the other 99% of raiders that see even the heroic content, they don't even get a chance to fight the same version of the boss. It gets a slight nerf after 1-2 weeks, then a major nerf after 4-5 weeks, then it becomes steamroll friendly 2 months in. If you happen to be a guild that is slightly behind in progression, you never actually get to fight the boss in it's original form, heroic or not.</div></div><hr />

I guess that items that aren't transmogged aren't counted. I mean... if the weapons that aren't transmogged also were counted I think you'll see a different list.<br />

<br />
Firstly, I don't remember that many whine threads regarding the look of TBC items.<br />
Secondly, I think what's important here, perhaps just as much as the look, is the nostalgia factor. For many people who've been playing WoW for a long time, TBC still represents the golden era of the game. <br />
Each people will give you his/her own reason, but I think large part of this is because TBC was when people started to be good at the game. You could no longer raid without having a clue about what you were doing (which was very well possible in vanilla, until halfway through AQ40). I think that's something that is too easily overlooked. People got better and cared more about their achievements (as in, what boss they downed) and items.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He dies around 4.5mil on normal mode. So I have a feeling he dies around 6.7mil on heroic...makes sense. Not totally sure atm only 6/8hm haven't seen madness heroic /sigh someone give me 10 mages and 5 rogues!</div></div><hr />

Well the quest reward stuff was incredibly ugly. However, the stuff from the later raids was some of the best that has been seen in the game. So it isn't too strange when you take that into consideration.</div></div><hr />

BC was, in my opinion, the height of Blizzard's art design as far as armor and weapons are concerned.<br />
<br />
The problem is that most people never had a complete armor set at the same time, instead they'd have piece of various sets and their gear ends up clashing terribly. This is particularly prevalent these days when you're leveling through outland, you don't even see the beautiful tier sets. <br />
<br />
Today, Blizzard is much better at giving you a matching, coherent set of gear. It's just sad that the gear itself isn't as iconic or well-crafted.</div></div><hr />

I'm not a hardcore raider, or even a raider most of the time. But for me, and I think most people, it's not so much about the difficulty of the fight, as much as it is that the entire encounter feels uninspired and anticlimactic.</div></div><hr />

TBC still represents the golden era of the game.

All the numbers ignore fighting the boss(es) in beta and fighting the bosses in normal. Guilds effectively get the strategy, gear/spec requirements before the boss even hits live. They smash directly through to the last boss and don't have any RL exhaustion from struggling through prior bosses. That to me is a HUGE factor. Prior expansions most bosses either changed completely, were incredibly broken, or were not available at during the betas, and of course normal mode didn't exist either.<br />
<br />
Give me 100 swings at bat with a AAA league pitcher and I'll hit a major leaguer's pitch much faster than had I just went directly to the major leaguer.</div></div><hr />

[BC was] Accessible to everyone but with an upper end of play that was truly demanding and unique. <br />
Prior expansions most bosses either changed completely, were incredibly broken, or were not available at during the betas, and of course normal mode didn't exist either. <br />
No, wrong. They are harder for the top guilds, yes. But for the other 99% of raiders that see even the heroic content, they don't even get a chance to fight the same version of the boss. It gets a slight nerf after 1-2 weeks, then a major nerf after 4-5 weeks, then it becomes steamroll friendly 2 months in. If you happen to be a guild that is slightly behind in progression, you never actually get to fight the boss in it's original form, heroic or not. What are you actually proposing? Remove the PTR so that top guilds do not have the opportunity to practice against the most difficult bosses? Experience has shown that to be ineffective with bosses like Sinestra and Lich King's platforms. You also seem to oppose the stratification and incremental nerfing of raiding. I suppose it can be frustrating wiping at 3% and only downing it the next week after a nerf and not knowing whether you'd have gotten the kill. Incremental nerfing doesn't make a huge difference once world first has been achieved though, pretty much everyone recognises that it is more difficult to get a boss down for the first time. To achieve accessibility and retain raiders willing to devote over seven hours a day to obtaining a world first, it's a necessity. You presumably wouldn't oppose accessibility since you cede that the bosses of the latter expansions are in fact harder for the top guilds. The implementation is sort of similar to FPS games: most will complete it once on normal mode, those that want to steam through it just to check out the hype/story will play through on easy (LFR) and the dedicated players will ramp it up to hardcore (heroic). Hardly anyone complains that Halo has a mode other than legendary.</div></div><hr />

Just wondering, the link for the Rogue weps Twinblade is the 353 ilvl version, which is from Cata, so am I missing something? If 0% are from Cata, then this should be the old wep link, but I know of several people who have mogged the Cata version, since it is much more accessible, so, maybe more than 0%?</div></div><hr />

The CHT doesn't match my current set of gear, but I sure as HELL still have mine - and my Perd's Blade too. They're the only weapons other than pure vanity items I've kept over the years.<br />
<br />
There were certain weapons that, in vanilla, marked you as a &quot;good rogue&quot; for the first time - the fact that you were not just in attendance for Domo and Rag, but were also WORTHY of weapons from them...that was something back then.<br />
<br />
So yeah, it doesn't surprise me at all to see those in the top five for rogues.<br />
<br />
What really surprises me is the lack of super-druidy weapons on druids. Many staves out there scream &quot;druid weapon&quot; - and it's just odd not to see them.<br />
