From the SWTOR website:<br />
<br />
<br />
We’re excited to announce that later this month we will be conducting our largest Beta Testing Weekend yet, specifically designed to help us stress test our servers in preparation for the launch of Star Wars™: The Old Republic™.<br />
<br />
They also invited everyone that signed up for the beta before the 11th of November.</div></div><hr />

It's a stress test, everyone who had applied to beta test is in for a weekend and a large chunk of sites have keys to give away.<br />
<br />
They are in no way desperate, they have almost a million physical pre orders.</div></div><hr />

Hmm. The only people that I saw were grumpy were those that didn't understand the point of a stress test and trying to max out the servers. Those that got to play didn't have much negative to say. Beta is there for a reason. There are always going to be things that people won't like. However, those calling the game crap are just either negative by nature or feel that there has to be a winner or loser in this WOW vs. SWTOR argument. Both can, and will, co-exist quite well. TOR has its 900,000 hard copy US pre-orders, plus another estimated 1.5 to 2.0 million digital and international pre-orders. The game will play differently than WOW, which is good. We need many new ideas to come to the MMO table so EVERYONE can improve their product. Competition spurs innovation and creativity. If SWTOR and GW2 can come out and hold on to 4-6 million subscriber base, that puts pressure on Blizzard to do their best. Likewise with the others. Everyone wins. There doesn't always have to be a loser.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure who'd get into the beta and call it that. I can imagine people who were accepted into the beta and were too impatient at the size of the queues that were involved on the first stress test night, but it's hard to believe a normal player would have significant issues with the game as it is right now.<br />
<br />
It wasn't laggy, it wasn't particularly buggy; there was just a massive queue to get in at the start. Loading screens for one or two things took a little longer than one might prefer, but it's a stress test, and things got better as the weekend wore on.<br />
<br />
I doubt you. But for your friends who didn't like it - I'm glad they've determined that they'll not be playing, and that their input has apparently done away with any desire you'd have to play the game. Play what you like, and don't begrudge what others do for enjoyment (when it doesn't infringe on the enjoyment of other people).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly, if you're from the generation who grew up with the &quot;instant gratification&quot; mind set (I want it, and I want it NAO!11!!), this game may not work for you. The quests have rich story lines, and you need to actually go through the cinematics and make a choice, which will affect how good or evil you choose to be.

Loved the fact that the quests would take you to a cinematic and you had to pay attention and make a choice on how to respond instead of the WOW: click accept and look at ur map to get the quest done... 2 thumbs up so far from me... cant wait to get into beta and see more of the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Neither Assassination or Combat spec are hard, but if i had to say ''which is hard between the two?'' It would of course be Assassination. I played Assassination for months then finally switched to Combat, and not only getting a huge DPS increase I realized how easier it was than Assassination too. Don't get defensive over someone saying ''combat is easier blah blah'' just because that's your spec and you like to think it's actually hard to a certain aspect when in fact its easy.<br />
<br />
DPS wise: combat &gt; assassination &gt; sub<br />
<br />
skill wise: sub &gt; assassination &gt; combat<br />
<br />
In my opinion.</div></div><hr />

So did Rift. <br />
<br />
That's all I'm sayin'.<br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly, if you're from the generation who grew up with the &quot;instant gratification&quot; mind set (I want it, and I want it NAO!11!!), this game may not work for you. The quests have rich story lines, and you need to actually go through the cinematics and make a choice, which will affect how good or evil you choose to be. I think focusing on the way they do quest lines is a bit different than the usual run of MMOs that are out there, and I don't mind that at all. I'm in the mood for something different after 7 years of WoW, not that I plan on leaving WoW in the immediate future.<br />
<br />
If you're waiting for something different from WoW, then don't settle for SWTOR. Yes, the questing and storylines are grand and nerdy-fantastic and familiar to the Bioware TOR games but....<br />
<br />
Max level? Quests done? Oh look, time to get ready for the raid. Hmm, maybe I'll just do some BGs while waiting for them to log on. Ho. Hum.<br />
<br />
It's all flowers and daisies and puppies until you get to what you're going to be doing for the rest of your playing career (unless you roll tons of alts). The exact same thing you're doing now in WoW.<br />
<br />
<br />
Me too - a very small minority compared to the 99% who had positive things to say.<br />
<br />
You're deluding yourself; you should probably stop that. Most professional game reviewers share my exact same concerns, especially veterans that've been watching MMO release after MMO release for the last 8 years. The game will be fun for 2 months and everyone who reached endgame will leave when they realize it for the WoW clone it is.</div></div><hr />

They said they would be making them usable in all specs, and combat needs slower main hands. Guess the equip is what they come up with so combat rogues could use them also despite their speed.<br />

Rofl Wow Clone, everything is a wow clone, if they take elements from a game that made it successful and build upon it. So technically wow is an Everquest, Warhammer Online, Guild Wars, and any other mmo that was released clone. Since they use the leveling concept, the questing concept, the mount concept, the idea of killing high level bosses.<br />

LAAAAAMMMMMEEEEEEE.... It's not where BM and Survival fail. They know what they nerfed and what they didn't since the majority of the players hit Heroic dungeon levels.<br />
Survival need more Mastery Bonus and reversal of the Agility cut at Hunting Party. Kil Command is ridiculous.

<br />
Pretty much this. Anyone dismissing any other game as a WoW clone has completely missed the boat. WoW did not invent the MMO genre, it simply took what worked, polished it up a bit, added some flavour, and we all know how well that went for Blizzard. Now BioWare has taken it to the next level, they simply took what worked, polished it up a bit, added some flavour, and we'll see how that goes. <br />
<br />
The simple fact is that games that try out a radical departure from the norm usually fail or stay very small, especially MMOs. Players don't want revolutionary gameplay, that's why, for example, the Nintendo Wii failed for gamers. What gamers want above all else is smooth sailing, WoW has offered that for years now and I'm willing to bet that it's one of the biggest things the game has going for it. Amidst a sea of MMOs that are either too niche for some people, too clinky for others, and too bugged for anyone else, WoW stands out as a relatively stable game with a ton of players.<br />
<br />
So if BioWare wants The Old Republic to be a success, what they need most of all is a very polished experience, an experience that feels familiar (this is an absolute must-have if you want to appeal to the general MMO public, people don't want to have to spend weeks or even days learning the ropes, it has to be instantly accessible) and finally retain a lot of players. Revolutionary gameplay is not required, despite what many forum-based naysayers would like you to believe, what is required is fun, stability, and friends. I happen to believe The Old Republic has all three, and someone else's opinion may differ.<br />
<br />
But to say the game will quickly crumble into a pile of fail simply because it's a WoW clone shows just how little people really understand how games in general and MMOs in particular work.</div></div><hr />

Actually they pretty much packed several servers full of people, there were queues for much of the time I believe.<br />
<br />
Granted, I skipped most of the weekend because of the massive clusterfuck of people(the server I've been testing on actually seemed to have the most people).<br />

Now there is Minecraft, which allows me to express that same creativity that Legos did, but also with added RPG elements that I enjoy from other games. <br />

Also I would like to point out MMO-Champion did not receive any Beta keys for SW:ToR (they are not 'recruiting from a WoW Website') they were given to Curse.</div></div><hr />

Are you seriously that silly ? You're either new to rogue or don't know jack shat about your class. You're refering to the equip effect of the main hand i presume since its the only thing that screams &quot;combat&quot; on the stats, if you look at the daggers min max dmg it's still that of a main hand dagger (which appeals to Muti/Sub spec) so to make it viable for Combat they add the Equip effect of 45% dmg increase on your combat spec CP generators.<br />

One thing that is &quot;lame&quot; is people using the world &quot;lame&quot;.<br />

Playing Beta = Amazing considering its in Beta (final stages).<br />

No game that comes out of Beta has it all, even WoW.<br />

So did Rift. <br />
<br />
That's all I'm sayin'.<br />
<br />
<br />
How can you even compare Rift to TOR? Rift was WoW 2.0 with (Rifts dynamic events), TOR has simply more going for it ... <br />
<br />
No one cares if it kills WoW or not, infact it good if it wont since it promotes more competition within the MMO&quot;RPG&quot; genre.</div></div><hr />

Stop calling other noob, then you clearly dont know much about combat spec.<br />
The proc immediately granting 5 combo points and cause your finishing moves to generate 5 combo points. Lasts 6 sec. With Restless Blades that is 10 sec of you Adrenaline Rush and Killing Spree each finish move. So with like 45-60sec icd/proc rate, its like 60 sec less cd each minute.</div></div><hr />

Not sure how, because of its art style they are using? Because TOR is an MMO and every MMO that ever released after WoW must be a WoW copy/ripoff/x.0 ?? Is it because there is similarities?<br />
<br />
WoW is EQ 2.0. See what I did there?<br />

Anyway, TOR won't end up as Rift, it has enough differences and features to carry it.</div></div><hr />

You need to get invited by Bioware/EA/Lucas after you put your code in. That invitation email contains the download link etc.<br />
<br />
Also, they have 2 types of closed betas. First is the &quot;regular&quot; beta where people can log in/play/test everyday. Then there is &quot;weekend&quot; beta where you are invited for a weekend and then lose access again till they invite again or till they do another weekend beta.<br />
<br />
I've been in a couple of weekend betas. This key does not seem an invitation for a &quot;regular&quot; beta but only the &quot;weekend&quot; beta. So, once you enter the beta code, you will still have to wait till the next weekend beta (could be this weekend, could be next, or in 3 weeks!). On the other hand, if this key is only for weekend beta, then it is useless if you had registered with Bioware earlier than 11/11/11 and opted in for beta. Because for all those opted in prior to 11/11/11 they sent out stress test invites last week. So you are already &quot;chosen&quot; and will be invited to the next weekend beta. Maybe with these extra keys they want more people for a 2nd stress test, I don't know.</div></div><hr />

I'm not defensive at all...I'm rolling on the floor laughing at your numbers. Even if they manage 2million they will end up like AoC once the new setting lost its magic(which is after about 2-3 months). That's the sad truth. I would love to have a game that can seriously compete with WoW...but I'm fed up with all those stupid promises how great the next new game will be and how much better than WoW it is...just to read 3 months later that it already passed its subscribers peak and is on the way down. Every single time a new game with an expensive license comes out it's exactly the same show....and everytime guys like you come out of their hole and promise that this time it will be different. You are like one of those &quot;tomorrow the apocalypse will happen&quot;-prophets...sooner or later you will likely be right.....but untill then you gonna be wrong again and again and again...and...again.</div></div><hr />

I think it will be a solid game and sell well but calling it a WoW killer is fing stupid, not everyone likes science fiction, let alone starwars, but i do expect more subscribers to drop though. WoWs time has come and I think blizzard will try and keep it going strong until the release of there new MMO, we all know Project titan is supposedly a brand new IP for blizzard let alone a game changer in the MMO world, so i would expect they will try and pull another WoW all over again and shock the world with a new and crazy way to play MMOs, and i suspect wow will continue to be support and slowly go into a F2P option service if the player base gets to low.</div></div><hr />

So much stress for no reason. After reading the thread up until this point, I've gathered that the 'wow-diehards' are already up at arms at a new mmo. Please, give it a break. World of Warcraft has been steadily losing subscriptions since Cataclysm released. Once you cope with the fact that not everyone that plays wow feels the same way as you, you'll feel much better. See.... Rift is doing fine. While their community is not as big as WoW's, they still manage to keep rolling out content. SWToR is going to bring the Star Wars fans and Mass Effect fans into the MMO genre, and if you have been following the creation of SWToR at all, then you would see that THAT is their biggest goal, not killing wow. As a company, I'm completely positive Bioware doesn't prioritize trying to bully WoW off of the market with their 10 million subs or whatever. Rather, they are going to focus on creating new mmo content, because let's face it...anything in World of Warcraft is a given for every other MMO to have now.Will WoW fall to SWToR? LOL you people who label things wow-killers are quite hilarious. No, no this won't be the wow-killer... but as wow gets older and older and stays on a steady decline with their sub base, who knows. Maybe one day. What I predict will happen, though, is SWToR will introduce new ways of doing things, new pvp modes, new dynamic content, just like Rift did...and wow-sub's everywhere will continue to demand Blizzard takes it up a knotch...and either they will or they won't. But it will add pressure to WoW from a development standard.Anyway, to those who feel they can just laugh at everybody else's decision on what game they want to play: play the freaking game you like playing and stop hating on what everyone else wants to do. You are not special. Go Sit in the corner.</div></div><hr />

I'm not defensive at all...I'm rolling on the floor laughing at your numbers. Even if they manage 2million they will end up like AoC once the new setting lost its magic(which is after about 2-3 months). That's the sad truth. I would love to have a game that can seriously compete with WoW...but I'm fed up with all those stupid promises how great the next new game will be and how much better than WoW it is...just to read 3 months later that it already passed its subscribers peak and is on the way down. Every single time a new game with an expensive license comes out it's exactly the same show....and everytime guys like you come out of their hole and promise that this time it will be different. You are like one of those &quot;tomorrow the apocalypse will happen&quot;-prophets...sooner or later you will likely be right.....but untill then you gonna be wrong again and again and again...and...again.<br />
<br />
have you played the beta? and have you seen the pre-order numbers? can you see into the future? Out of 20 real-life friends that got into the beta.. (some the general) 1 isn't a fan... ToR isn't for everyone... some will stay will WoW... &amp; you know what? THAT'S OK!<br />
Btw i'm not one of those people that (come out of their holes) to call the next mmo a wow-killer... i do NOT believe ToR will kill WoW... it's a 7 year old game.. some people grow tried of it (this guy).. nothing more. it's still a great MMO.<br />
You don't see ToR devs saying &quot;you're not in azeroth anymore&quot; they're aiming to bring more ppl into the MMO market. they are not gunning for subs from other MMO like Rift did..</div></div><hr />

I was in last weekend's test, and you definitely do NOT need a good computer to run it. My computer is about 4 years old (it's a laptop so it hasn't had any upgrades since I got it), and I was able to run it very smoothly at decent settings (I think I could have gone max settings but I never bothered to try, was too absorbed in playing). <br />
<br />
I was worried that Bioware would not do justice to one of my favorite franchises of all time, but the game greatly exceeded my expectations. It's easy to pick up, the only time i lagged was in the starting zone, in the first hour of the test when there was hundreds of people running around. The questing system is very immersive, and fully voice acted. I could go on, but I've probably violated the NDA enough by now.<br />
<br />
To those saying it's a WoW clone, what did you expect? WoW set the standard for the industry, and given that a majority of mmo players play WoW, it makes sense to make it a smooth transition for their target market. Trust me, the game is different enough to be refreshing, yet familiar enough to not be overwhelming.<br />
<br />
Don't hate on it until you try it.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunatley this is par for the course. I loathe the fact that people feel they need to validate their choice of MMO by immediately hating on any other MMO that comes out. The inevitable comments &quot;See you back in 3 months&quot;, &quot;Its just a WoW clone&quot; , &quot;It will fail&quot;. Acting as though WoW is some sort of inevitablitly that is unescapable. I wish the people who make these kind of comments would realize that they do not need to validate their descision to play WoW by trashing other games (that they never even tried).<br />
<br />
Honestly I am to the point of exhaustion with the term &quot;WoW killer&quot;. I quit WoW nearly a year ago after playing it for 5 years and I honestly couldn't give 2 shits whether WoW dies, lives, falls off a cliff, gets married, gets divorced, becomes and alcoholic, Goes to AA, or goes and fucks itself.</div></div><hr />

It's well polished for the state of the game leading up to release. I've played a Powertech to level 21 and downed a world boss in a raid. All the tools are there. They are not as neatly polished as WoW's tools but I have no reason to believe they won't get there. ToR does a few things very well that WoW doesn't do.1) Story. As much as I liked the Death Knight and Worgen story lines, they pale in comparison to the scripted stories for each character class. The only other game with an epic storyline that is as good is Lord of the Rings Online. ToR's voice acting is hit or miss but generally very good with respect to the core story lines for a class.2) Companions are generally a nice touch and a distinguishable game mechanic from WoW.3) Spaceships are no where near SWG but they are good enough to be fun and practical. Besides, who doesn't want to own a spaceship? It's easily the most satisfying housing &quot;reward&quot; in any MMO. I'm hoping they eventually allow cosmetic customization to the EQ2 degree or the LotRO level.That said, ToR needs a few features that I hope Addons can solve. Equipment Manager, Looking for Group/Dungeon/Raid, Flashpoint summons and some form of Recount are all glaring UI issues that need some resolution. ToR's story telling get's repetitive after the first few zones though there's not much you can do about that. There's only so many variations on story plot and thousands of quests.The game will do well. It'll pull some people away from WoW. Blizzard's hoping that it only pulls those that did the Annual Pass subscription. If you're in that group, you'll more than likely come back to WoW versus paying for two subscriptions. ToR will however, survive and prosper.</div></div><hr />

Good Lordie this is so true, I hate it. Why can't people just be like hey I really liked X-Game it's a good game but I played it so long I just needed a change of scenery? Or why can't people be like WoW is a great game I'm just more of a Sci-Fi nerd than fantasy. I or Vice Versa. I mean I don't understand the need to hate. Besides a game that is healthy competition for WoW would be good, because it means we won't get another half arsed expansion like cata cause they'll have to be on their toes so no matter what game you're rooting for you should be excited about the other, because one game pushing limits will make the other do the same it's win/win for everyone really.<br />
<br />
So can't we all just get along and enjoy video games and hope both games do very well in the future for everyone's sake :)</div></div><hr />

So you can learn to play your class. <br />
<br />
Regardless of the hype now, SWTOR will be made or broken by its retention levels - just like every other MMO. It can launch with huge bugs, and so long as they get fixed within the first 30 days it'll be OK.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think it may take a few months to get there, but SWTOR will eventually capture that classic Star Wars feel. There'll be exactly two Sith, and the one remaining Jedi will be a n00b.</div></div><hr />

The proc immediately granting 5 combo points and cause your finishing moves to generate 5 combo points. Lasts 6 sec. With Restless Blades that is 10 sec of you Adrenaline Rush and Killing Spree each finish move. So with like 45-60sec icd/proc rate, its like 60 sec less cd each minute.<br />

<br />
It takes 5 or 6 days playing casually to go 1 to 85 for most people. 120-144 hours may seem like not a lot of time to you, but to the average person that is a pretty significant investment to be playing a videogame. The &quot;hardcore&quot; gamer can probably do that in less time with full heirlooms and straight questing, but you have to keep in mind that to be at that level of play, that requires a much greater time investment to begin with.<br />
<br />
That said, I played TOR this weekend and I was extremely impressed with it. It's not WoW, and I love the fact. From my initial impressions, it strikes me as a much more casual MMO. There is a good chance that TOR will not cater to WoW's hardcore demographic, and I couldn't be happier. The players that would skip the cinematics and ignore dialogue for the sake of &quot;leveling efficiently&quot; will not enjoy this game. WoW's player community - especially on their own forums - is notorious for being one of the whiniest, self-entitled, elitist demographics in the history of the industry and most if not all of that stems from the &quot;hardcore&quot; playerbase. I have my fingers crossed that TOR will drive them away (which in reality, it would be pretty generous to say that the &quot;hardcore&quot; players make up even 5% of the total playerbase) so the rest of us can bro it up. <br />
<br />
You can't look at TOR like a typical MMO. It's a glorified Knights of the Old Republic game - especially from what I've played - and it doesn't take long before the first starting area's story ropes you in. I remember infiltrating Korriban in KOTOR and pretending to be apart of the Sith Academy and thinking to myself &quot;Man, this is pretty damn cool rising through the ranks and dealing with backstabbing students.&quot; and being disappointed that the Korriban segment was only a few hours long. I remember thinking &quot;damn, wouldnt it be cool if they made a Sith game like this&quot;, and imagine my delight when I first started playing the Sith Warrior's story. Same thing with the Smuggler. A whole KOTOR based on being a sarcastic, gun-touting smuggler. That shit is awesome. They're literally KOTOR games except without the whole &quot;you have to save the universe you are the chosen one&quot; hero's journey, you're a regular dude trying to distinguish yourself. And you get a whole story. A co-op KOTOR with having the added bonus of endgame/pvp/raiding/whatever after you kill your story's Big Bad and the game would normally be over.<br />
<br />
The lack of auto attack, the sound effects, and the different animations for attacking (you even dynamically block enemy's attacks automatically like in KOTOR1/2) and mob ragdolls made the combat feel engaging and a lot more exciting than WoW's &quot;1112 1112 3211 1112&quot; whack-a-mole where every animation is the same one each time and characters don't even look like they're fighting each other. And by Level 6 I was already involved in backstabbing and betraying bitches and conspiracy as my Sith Warrior, and I forgot that I was even playing an MMO at a few points, and was only reminded by it when I saw other players in the same area. <br />
<br />
I've rambled on about this game enough, but I've been so thoroughly impressed with it. It's not WoW, and that's a good thing.</div></div><hr />

You're surprised that there's betrayal and backstabbing in the Sith storyline? I guess I better not tell you that the Jedi Knight's story deals with learning the ways of the Jedi, heaven forbid.</div></div><hr />

You have redeemed the key, the message is just bugged. Check your list of redeemed codes, you'll see you're in for Beta Event 1 - which is the first stress test.</div></div><hr />

I had the same problem until I checked my Curse account settings and found that I had &quot;Allow Curse to Send Email&quot; unchecked. It could also be a browser addon interfering.</div></div><hr />

That was the problem. Would have been helpful to have that in the instructions. Thanks! :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pacster</div><div class="date">2011-11-16, 10:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That said, I played TOR this weekend and I was extremely impressed with it. It's not WoW, and I love the fact. From my initial impressions, it strikes me as a much more casual MMO. There is a good chance that TOR will not cater to WoW's hardcore demographic, and I couldn't be happier. The players that would skip the cinematics and ignore dialogue for the sake of &quot;leveling efficiently&quot; will not enjoy this game. WoW's player community - especially on their own forums - is notorious for being one of the whiniest, self-entitled, elitist demographics in the history of the industry and most if not all of that stems from the &quot;hardcore&quot; playerbase. I have my fingers crossed that TOR will drive them away (which in reality, it would be pretty generous to say that the &quot;hardcore&quot; players make up even 5% of the total playerbase) so the rest of us can bro it up. <br />
<br />
I've rambled on about this game enough, but I've been so thoroughly impressed with it. It's not WoW, and that's a good thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
More of this. It's not like the exact same thing has been written about every other MMO before. Hell, even the AoC-guys claimed that the playerbase ist much more mature and civilised(which was pretty funny given that the marketing of Funcom was like &quot;the most brutal inet game&quot;...&quot;blood and breasts&quot;...which surely attracts mature players) than that of WoW.<br />
Deal with the fact that it's going to be the exact same childish players that run around in WoW...because those are the MMO-players that go for e-peen stuff. SWTOR is NOT a roleplaying game...it's about the same old &quot;I kill you and laugh&quot; and &quot;My equippment is more shiny than yours&quot;-stuff.<br />
And believe me....after the first high level char the game will just be about &quot;Skip the videos and blah blah and get me to max level&quot; cause the number of different quests is limited and gets repeatative sooner or later(kill, rescue, collect, defend, search/get info, steal...and that's the same in all games). Vids are nice...so is voice...for the first char. The second time it only gets on your nerves cause you already know that stuff and it needs time to load, cancel etc..<br />
But really annoying is this AoC &quot;decide between 5 answers of which all 5 or at least 3 have the exact same effect(or just get rid of one answer and you have to choose between the remaining 4 again)&quot;-dialogues. That sucks already with the first char cause most of the stories are really boring(and have been around in 100 other games already). I hate that already in single player games and it definitely is a curse in MMOs.</div></div><hr />
