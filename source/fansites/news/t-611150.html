It was on the PTR atleast a long time ago, but when will it be released?.<br />
<br />
<br />
your talking about 2.4.3 i think, atm there is nothing on ptr.<br />
<br />
On another issue, does the ''small'' arena change mean you cannot sack a voidie before an arena match starts to get the shield?<br />
Because i think, together with druid/priest prehotting thats the only buff with less then 30 secs.</div></div><hr />

Stormwind Harbour is being build on life-servers atm, so that it will be finished when WotLK hits :)<br />
Talents from the addon for TBC users will be implemented shortly before the addon is released, just like TBC ;)<br />
So there's nothing to wait for atm as testing for Wrath will take some months still and the addon will not be released towards the end of the year. So if you're bored of the actual content go out, i think we got summer :D</div></div><hr />

Unholy<br />
Bone Armor reworked: Moved from tier 6 to tier 8. Your diseases will now also cause Crypt Fever, which reduces an enemy´s attributes by 1%. Crypt Fever lasts for 18 seconds and can stack up to 3 times.<br />
Crypt Fever reworked: Reduces the runic power cost of a Death Coil by 5 and reduces the cooldown of Death and Decay by 5 seconds. ( Used to be the same as Bone Armor is now, causing the crypt fever debuff ).<br />

Lasts 5 minutes. ( This new talents replaces the role of the old Bone Armor ).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
These three are mistakes, just shift each one over on spot and you'll get the correct effects.<br />

<br />
Morbidity ( New Talent ): Reduces the runic power cost of a Death Coil by 5 and reduces the cooldown of Death and Decay by 5 seconds.<br />
<br />
However, the talent trees are still unfinished as per Ghostcrawler's post:<br />
There are a few bugs in those tech trees. Off the top of my head,<br />
<br />
-- Killing Machine and Deathchill benefit Frost Strike. Killing Machine only procs from white attacks.<br />
-- There are no stacking diseases. Icy Touch causes Frost Fever and Plague Strike causes Blood Plague. You can talent to get a few more spells that cause those diseases, and Unholy can add two more diseases (Ebon Plague and Unholy Blight). This makes Unholy Blight quite useful because it's the only way to get 4 diseases up for Blood Strike or Obliterate.<br />
-- Sudden Doom does benefit from Heart Strike. Heart Strike hits very hard and has a nice debuff with PvP and PvE uses (think Icy Veins, Windfury, Frenzy, Flurry and a host of boss abilities). It's less confusing than the previous debuff and isn't dependent on a next strike.<br />
-- Chilblains lasts twice as long.<br />
-- Abom Strength benefits the raid.<br />
-- Imp Rune Tap lowers cooldown as well as +health.<br />
-- Crypt Fever doesn't affect attributes, but it boosts the damage of other diseases on the target.<br />
-- Corpse Explosion costs 1 Unholy (remember Raise Dead is free).<br />
-- Blood-Caked Blade doesn't cause a disease. It adds melee damage to existing ones.<br />
-- Morbidity lowers cooldown on DnD and cost of Death Coil.<br />
<br />
I'm sure there are others. We'll get them fixed up.</div></div><hr />

Probably one month before release of WOTLK* and most likely it will have all WOTLK talents and changes like AGI for ench shamans, new steady shot for hunters etc.<br />
<br />
* WOTLK will come this year between October and December - because it is Blizzard I would say late November/early December is release date.</div></div><hr />

<br />
* WOTLK will come this year between October and December - because it is Blizzard I would say late November/early December is release date.<br />

ENHANCEMENT.<br />

Come on people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
also the critical healing talent for shamans is a pos imo, the 20s debuff is too long. 10s and I'd consider it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mind Mastery only gives 15% instead of 25% spell damage now from int. Graneted, its not that huge of a nerf, but it figures they do this because &quot;most mages will consider going arcane now, lets nerf their spell damage increase in the tree!&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
oh well no biggy, we only lose about 60-80 spell damage from it -_- (by level 80)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reading-comprehension<br />
<br />
The buff gets reduced. It's not a debuff.<br />
<br />
You activate the talent, you get +60% crit chance for healing spells for 20 seconds. <br />
Your first heal crits after 3 seconds - you have +40% remaining crit chance for 17 seconds.<br />
Your second heal crits after 10 seconds - you have +20% remaining crit chance for 10 seconds<br />
Your 3rd heal crits after 15 seconds - crit chance back to normal, tidal force effect is spent<br />
Your 4th heal crits after 18 seconds - no -20% crit debuff since tidal force is not present anymore.</div></div><hr />

damn I was going to change my mage for WOTLK, from deep Frost to Fire or Arcane -- and now they go and buff deep Frost! :P<br />
<br />
still I am hoping the final Arcane tree will be good</div></div><hr />

Yes, because a 3 minute cooldown burst compares to shatter crits. ;)</div></div><hr />

Yea because a mass of dots hardly compares to a mages shatter combo which almost every class can escape from right?<br />
