Talon's Vengeance Faction Unlocked<br />
AlopexGames (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/5a1hgt/how_to_unlock_the_talons_vengeance_faction/) shared how to unlocked the Talon's Vengeance (http://www.wowdb.com/factions/2018-talons-vengeance) faction:<br />
<br />
<br />
Start the Falcosaur quest line (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6054-Patch-7-1-Live-This-Week#falcosaur) and progress far enough to unlock a mount.<br />
Talk to Aviana (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/97925-aviana) in Highmountain to unlock the vendor so you can start grinding reputation. <br />

The Falcosaurus quests are on a daily gate or a weekly gate? Or there is something more to get the other quests to pop up?<br />
daily (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/791297720799469568))<br />
to be on the same page, we are talking about the quests after getting the hatchling and leveling it to 25.<br />
yesm (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/791299822779191300))<br />
<br />
what do we do when the day comes our falcosaur finds out we're the ones who killed his mother and orphaned him in the first place?<br />
The end of the questline will answer that (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/791341907007770624))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Can you tell me difference between balancing a moba compared to an MMORPG<br />
Interesting question. They aren't that different from a high level. In both games, you want for players to be able to pick the character they want to play without worrying that poor tuning on the part of the devs makes their choice sub-optimal. Frustration is &quot;what bad looks like&quot; in both games. That's the main feeling you are trying to prevent.<br />
<br />
Here are some random musings off the top of my head. I haven't done a really robust analysis of the similarities and differences.<br />
<br />
Burst damage (how much damage can be squeezed into a small time frame) is an important consideration in both genres.<br />
<br />
Sustained damage is more important in an MMO, especially in PvE. In PvP in either genre, you rarely have time to deliver on sustained damage for very long. (When LoL players talk about sustained damage, their time frame is still nothing like a WoW boss fight.) Sustained damage is also a lot easier to simulate than burst damage, since tiny changes in the variables of the burst situation can have massive effects.<br />
<br />
Movement and positioning are more important in the MOBA. They are important in the MMO, especially in PvP, just less so.<br />
<br />
Rotations are more important in the MMO, since sustain is more important. As a corollary, minimizing down time (even fractions of a second) is really important in an MMO for sustain, which leads to the inclination to try and automate or script.<br />
<br />
Crowd control is really important to tune well in both the MOBA and the PvP part of the MMO. CC for PvE isn't a big deal to tune.<br />
<br />
Things like cooldowns and resource management are about equally important in both genres.<br />
<br />
Scaling is easier to balance for a MOBA, because you know what the max level character with best gear looks like. In an MMO you are often designing around guesses for what gear and scaling may look like years from now.<br />
<br />
A lot of MMO rewards are designed around rarity. You might create a best in slot weapon, but very few players may be able to achieve it. Everyone can generally get anything they want (excepting purely cosmetic items) in a MOBA.<br />
<br />
Class tuning is a really big deal for the MMO because players have so much time invested in that character. Plenty of MOBA players have mains too, but they still arguably lose less if that character is rendered temporarily unviable. In an MMO, you may be preventing someone from being able to raid or PvP if you nerf their dude. In the MOBA, they may be understandably grumpy about it, but they can usually just play another character.<br />
<br />
The player experience in PvE in the MMO is more about paying attention to external cues while trying to maximize throughput. Things like clarity (understanding what is going on) are slightly less important because much of what you are doing is rote after many trials, and you probably have fewer split-second decisions. In the MOBA, you almost never encounter the exact same team fight twice, so being able to read the situation, analyze, and make a decision quickly become really important.

Wtf, why such an underwhelming reward for 10k gold? They couldn't even make it an UPDATED model?<br /> 
<br />
Model? They couldn't even recolor!</div></div><hr />

Saurfang falls over after 3 hits. Why couldn't they make it an actual challenging fight, drop your stats to a normalized value and make it like an actual 1v1?</div></div><hr />

Must be great being able to recolor something and claim the plaudits for such work. Lazy, boring and vastly unimpressive.</div></div><hr />
