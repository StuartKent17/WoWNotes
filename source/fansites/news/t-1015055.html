The lead designers were originally going to talk about this topic at BlizzCon, but it didn’t really match the content of the rest of our “Intro to Pandaria” presentation, and seeing as how we finished our 90-minute slot with 93 seconds remaining, there wouldn’t have been room for it anyway. But several of us did bring up the issue with players and media we talked to, and it even ended up in at least one FAQ, so we figured we’d go ahead and get the information out there. Note that unlike much of what we presented for the upcoming Mists of Pandaria expansion, this is not an announcement. It’s more of a problem we’d like to address, and a couple of ways we potentially might do so. Feedback is certainly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Big Number Syndrome<br />
Hey, our stats are growing exponentially. If you look at everything from the Strength on a weapon to the damage being done by a Fireball crit or the amount of health the Morchok boss has, they look downright absurd compared to the numbers for level 60 characters in the original shipping version of World of Warcraft. It’s not exactly a surprise that we were going to end up here, and we knew where we were going every step of the way, yet regardless, here we are.<br />
<br />
<br />

Fig. 1. Item level vs. character level. Brown = vanilla. Green = BC. Blue = LK. Red = Cat.<br />
<br />
The numbers grew so much primarily because we wanted rewards to be compelling. Upgrading from a chestpiece that has 50 Strength into one that has 51 Strength is undeniably a DPS increase for the appropriate user, but it’s not a very exciting reward. Such negligible increases can drive players to do some weird things, such as skipping over tiers of gear or entire levels of content. This is particularly relevant when we’re talking about a new expansion. We don’t want level-85 players to have a reasonable shot at level-90 dungeons and raids (or PvP opponents) just because that content is balanced for gear that isn’t much better than what the level-85 players have.<br />
<br />
So we arrived at this point in a logical fashion, and we don’t really think we should have handled things any differently. However, it’s still a weird place to be, and it’s about to get weirder. These aren’t real items, in that we don’t know for sure what the item levels will be in patch 5.3 and patch 6.3 (if only we planned that far ahead!) but they are reasonable guesses, and you can see just how ridiculous the items look.<br />
<br />
<br />

Fig. 3. A theoretical item from patch 6.3.<br />
<br />
So what do we do about it? There are two general categories of solutions. The first is to make the numbers appear more manageable and the second is to actually change the numbers.<br />
<br />
Mega Damage<br />
The first solution could include changes like adding commas and the like to large numbers. We could also compress all of those 1000s to Ks and all of those 1,000,000s to Ms, much like we do with boss health today. Internally, we have been calling this the “Mega Damage solution” because instead of your Fireball hitting for 6,000,000 damage, it would hit for 6 MEGA DAMAGE (queue the Arcanite Ripper guitar solo).<br />
<br />
<br />

Fig. 4. Mega Damage. Name/screenshot not to be taken seriously.<br />
<br />
If we can make numbers such as floating combat text and boss health and item stats a little easier to read at a glance, then maybe we can endure numbers increasing exponentially for many digits to come. Now there are some very real computational limitations. PCs just can’t quickly perform math on very large numbers, so we’d have to solve all of those problems as well. Even today, tanks can hit the ten digit threat cap on some encounters.<br />
<br />
Item Level Squish<br />
The second solution actually involves compressing item levels, which is why we call it the “item level squish solution.” If we can lower stats on items, then we can lower every other number in the game as well, such as how much damage a Fireball does or how much health a gronn has. If you look at the item level curves, you can see that most of the growth occurs at the maximum character levels for the various expansions. This is because we keep rewarding more and more powerful gear to make the new raid tier and PvP season in an expansion reward significantly better gear than the previous one. However, those huge item level jumps don’t accomplish a lot once the character level has increased again. Very few players notice or care how much of an upgrade the Black Temple loot is over the Serpentshrine Cavern loot when their characters are level 80.<br />
<br />
With that in mind, we could go back and compress the big item level increases that occur at level 60, 70, 80 and 85. The Mists of Pandaria gear would still grow exponentially from patch to patch, but the baselines would be a lot lower. Health could go from 150,000 back down to something like 20,000. The big risk of this approach is that players will log into the new expansion and feel nerfed… even if all the other numbers are compressed as well.<br />
<br />
In other words, your Fireball will still do the same percentage damage to a player or a creature that it does today, but the number would be smaller. Logically, this seems like it would work, and it does. But it feels weird. When we tried this internally, everyone agreed that it just felt off throwing a spell for hundreds of damage when you are used to it doing thousands of damage.<br />
<br />
I came up with an analogy -- even though I know logically that people drive on the left side of the street in the UK (we drive on the right side of the street in the US) and wouldn’t be surprised to see it, it would still feel really disorienting if I was driving in the UK and had to make a right-hand turn.<br />
<br />

Fig. 5. Item level vs. character level before and after ‘squish’. Brown = vanilla. Green = BC. Blue = LK. Red = Cat<br />
<br />
So Now What?<br />
As I type this today, we haven’t decided on which if either solution we want to try. Maybe we’ll come up with yet another solution. Maybe it’s the kind of thing we can put off for another expansion so that players don’t have to adjust to the new talent system and a drastic item level compression at the same time. Or maybe it’s better just to pull the Band-Aid off fast and fix everything at once. Time will tell. I did, however, want to outline the problem lest any of you believe we don’t think there is a problem. There is. We’re just not sure of the best solution yet. If your answer is that stat budgets don’t have to grow so much in order for players to still want the gear, our experience says otherwise, and thus these proposed solutions exist. Your thoughts on the matter are valuable.<br />

<br />
As I said, I personally think it's a good idea (Though I'd be sad to lose my big numbers), the backlash from it would be insane.<br />
<br />
One thing I do immensely dislike about it is, it will make Old Content challenging again. Some people might like this, but personally I like the fact that I can faceroll my way through TBC and WoTLK raids with a small number of people to get Transmog gear.</div></div><hr />

Squish it. It might feel weird at first, but so would thousands of a stat on an item.<br />
<br />
Just make sure to rebalance all mobs health &amp; damage at the same time, or its going to get crazy.<br />

It will also could bring back a little less disparity between classes and specs.</div></div><hr />

Allow the same increased curve for the next xpac, so that you are getting rewarded strong with ilvl jumps. But then before an xpac launches, squish the numbers down and decrease the disparity between a fresh max level and a fully-raided max level right before the level grind of the next xpac.</div></div><hr />

It's pretty much the same problem with the world today: exponential growth of money, resource consumption, population, etc... On the topic: I think a mix between both solutions would probably be the best decision. Nerfing everything down ma feel awkward but it makes much more sense than a single nobody doing 3 million damage with an auto-attack. Other type restrictions could be implemented such as: you need more strength to bypass some sort of defense but you end up doing the same damage; implementing a mob resilience in which it reduces the critical strike chance against the mob, so you need to stack more than for lower level content; same for hit rating which already is in play. There is so many ways blizzard can workaround this that presenting these two only &quot;solutions&quot; makes me feel that they're being lazy about the issue... Just sayin'.</div></div><hr />

aye a poll would be lovely but I imagine we can all see what way it'll go already.<br />
<br />
I amglad they've seen the silly that stats were getting to and how dumb it was to massively inflate stats at the end of Wrath. I'll be glad that it won't be such a big ilvl jump between areas as well. I mean, when you finish Northrend, you immediately have to go up from ilvl 174s and whatever to 272s. It's a huge jump and always has me worried on a new char how long it's gonna be before I'm in good enough gear to do the new dungeons for the area. My only concern here is how capable we will be when solo'ing old content afterwards. At 90 will I still be able to do my weekly Attumen solo? What about MGT or BWL?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shiftyshifty</div><div class="date">2011-11-04, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I too am with (what seems to be for now) the majority in saying that the &quot;squish&quot; solution is best. The only problem becomes how to you balance the leveling content and old raids/leveling dungeons. With less of an increase in stats, the lower level dungeons will fall into that category of &quot;skippable&quot; meaning that, because the gear improves at a much slower rate, you can feasibly succeed in a dungeon &quot;tuned&quot; for levels much higher than you would previously. That said, I like the idea and think that it would be a good proving ground to weed out the mature players who understand what is going on and the immature ones who cry &quot;NERF!!&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Did you even bother reading the article? I thought this was actually one of the best they have done.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry but I personally don't want to see tanks with 1 million HP (with the rest of us floating around 800k) and average DPS numbers in the 100k-150k+ range because bosses have close to 1 billion health. I understand that it could technically work, assuming the content scales at the same pace we do. But it would feel somewhat stupid.<br />

They need to find a way to fix this curve, and fix it quickly, or in 2-3 expansions we'll see priests with 100 million hp soloing heroic Ragnaros.</div></div><hr />

I would feel really wierd to go from hitting for like 60-70k crit at the end of an expansion to hitting for only say 10k crits next expansion. One thing they could do i just not scale gear so drastically every expansion, i get you have to make gear enough of and upgrade that people will actually use it but do you really have to go as far as making stats on greens at the beginning of an expansion twices as much as the end game gear from the previous one? I saw just keep the stats on a consistant increase without any MAJOR jumps like they do every expansion.</div></div><hr />

They should of let previous epics still be good for the leveling duration, and not have to inflate numbers so much every new X.0 :/As for the two choices. I like big numbers, they are fun to watch... specially with my druid tank's health :D (BC was fun for that, more health then everyone ^^). But I also get the server load bigger number imposes on the servers, so might as well have a nice &quot;RESET&quot; button for the 5.0 pre-patch, and just start fresh from there, and be damned if there is QQ(cause let's face it, there will always be QQ everyone about anything and everything!). The main concern is, what about the next expension? in the graph it shows cata with a huge jump.. woudl they nerf all epics from raids by then so it feels more in check with their new model?&quot;MY EPICS HAVE BECOME GrEENS!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
As I said, I personally think it's a good idea (Though I'd be sad to lose my big numbers), the backlash from it would be insane.<br />
<br />
One thing I do immensely dislike about it is, it will make Old Content challenging again. Some people might like this, but personally I like the fact that I can faceroll my way through TBC and WoTLK raids with a small number of people to get Transmog gear.<br />

They would squish everything in the game. from your itemlevel to the hp of a boss. it would be totaly the same as it is right now in all aspects. only the numbers would be lower.<br />

Even with that whole Mega Damage idea, or anything similar, our systems will still have to compute ridiculously large and increasing complex numbers, which becomes a serious technical problem very quickly.It will be really weird to experience the squish but it's really the only way to go. My largest concern regarding it is actually the leveling process though, not anything endgame. Endgame will be built and balanced extensively with this in mind when it happens, so there's nothing to worry about there at all. But going back through all the 90 lvls (as I don't really see this being a task that would feasibly be completed for 5.x) of leveling content and making sure it all works is a seriously daunting task (which is why I don't think it'll happen in 5.x). But if anyone can do it, I'm sure Blizz can. The biggest concern after that will be forum backlash of &quot;Y I duz only 2k dps nao?&quot;</div></div><hr />

I don't think it's good. The current number system is good, maybe when we go into thousands of stats they can add K's or something as suggestion in solution 1.<br />
<br />
I don't think people have a big issue with the numbers - just with the ratio of health pools to damage done in PvP. I was hoping that would be changed to a model where it's more like Wrath than it is like Cata.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I would be majorly disappointed with an item crunch like solution 2 seems to suggest. I don't wanna go back to doing WotLK type damage that I was doing two years ago.<br />
<br />
Also I don't understand what's wrong with small increases on item level stats: they don't want people to be able to use gear they worked hard for in the future expansion? It's stupid... yeah, I never understood why there was such a huge ilvl jump; it's probably what I hate most about WoW and what I dread most about every new expansion.<br />
<br />
I also think it's weird that these are the people that consider it 'too much work' to rework Outland and Northrend to fit current lore, but are now suggesting they rework how every spell and health pool in the game scales. Stupid.<br />

Yeah, I'm a little angry with this idea.</div></div><hr />

It would make soloing old content harder, especially for non-plate wearing classes. But if they squished our stats, they would have to lower the stats of pretty much everything in the game by the same amount. The idea is it should feel the same as it does now if you are doing content relative to your level.

The squish might make it feel like we've been nerfed, but it's all relevant.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suprimus</div><div class="date">2011-11-04, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the solution is easy. If you look at Anarchy Online wich is/was a very advanced mmo in the matter of stats. Items dropped from a boss like now, but it wasnt always itemlvl 300, it may have been 288. Up from last expansions 250. And strenght went from say 250- 300. 50 up. But the big difference between wow and AO was: AO = most dps gets the loot. You didnt have as many instanced raid bosses, but rather groups from both factions went to the boss and had a dps competetition. So if 1 grp had 300 gear, and the other had 288, the 300 would win. But it wouldnt be by 50k damage, but something like 5k. So the differences was much smaller. This makes, best gear = win. not so good gear. = good enough to do shit, but not win. This sums something like this in wow= 250-290 ilvl gear = normal modes. 290-300= heroic raids. If your damn skilled. 275 - 300 = heroics. Then they wouldn't have to make the loot differences that big. Just go up by 25 by each patch and new raid.. Think a little about solutions and workarounds before you flame. This idea is not set in stone, but I think it could be a good one. And aswell, getting tokens in heroic would give you gear ilvl 300. so you got rewarded for the hassle. Problem with todays is its to much upgrade in each expansion. They have to make it so older content dose'nt get easy-mode, but rather a bit easier. But you have to get new SMALL upgrades to be relevnt in new raids... Hope you understand what I'm talking about.</div></div><hr />

How would it make anything more epic than it is now? As far as I've understood, it'd be a squish of EVERYTHING in game, meaning, every single mob, etc. So you'd do less dps, but the boss would also have less health than they do now...<br />

I did get it. I understand everything is relative.<br />
<br />
But without huge, gigantic ilevel jumps between expansions, Old Content will become more difficult, they even mentioned this in their own FAQ<br />
<br />
<br />
However, this also means the difference between each level between 1 and 85 will be less significant, so you may find that an enemy 5 or 10 levels below your own will be a little tougher to deal with than it was before.<br />
<br />
Of course they will scale EVERYTHING down, but it's impossible for mobs to still be 'challenging' at 80 but 'faceroll take 20 of them on at the same time' at 85, when they are planning to cut down the huge jumps.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crucialus</div><div class="date">2011-11-04, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It would make soloing old content harder, especially for non-plate wearing classes. But if they squished our stats, they would have to lower the stats of pretty much everything in the game by the same amount. The idea is it should feel the same as it does now if you are doing content relative to your level. Old raid bosses would be more difficult, relative to how they are now, and may keep non-plate wearing classes from soloing even Vanilla raids.<br />
<br />
I don't think I get you? If they squish everything (not a nerf), then a boss that would do, say, 3k damage per second would start doing much less (300?) so wouldn't that be the exact same when it comes to soloing?<br />

No, he gets it. Vanilla content would be harder, so would TBC and wotlk relative. This is a GOOD THING.<br />
<br />
Vanilla scaling would remain completely intact, that is to say, vanilla stats and encounters are the CORRECT WAY to scale.<br />
<br />
They want to nerf the crazy scaling AFTER that, which wasn't linear at all. Remember with the launch of TBC, we had the new combat rating system. In vanilla, stats were granted as a fixed percentage (piece of gear gives you 1% crit, affects your exact crit rating, for example).<br />
<br />
Older content would be harder (relative to now) at max level (but exactly the same at the relevant level), this is a good thing, it would make me want to play again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the squish would work - I've been noticing this for a while now. It's weird to get weapons with more stamina that my chest piece had in the last expansion. And really, it was only Cata where things got so out of control. It felt right to have the amount of health I did at the end of Vanilla, and BC, and Wrath. But Cata just blew that out of the water.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doombringer</div><div class="date">2011-11-04, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Neither solution is particularly elegant. As he highlights in the article, a level 80 piece of gear will not be a great jump from level 60, let alone 70. It can lead to people holding onto old gear and bypassing content, etc, etc, as he also mentioned. To put it into perspective, imagine if the gear you got in Tier 11 at the start of Cata was only a mite bit less powerful than the newest and latest in 4.3?<br />
<br />
I suppose a solution to encourage players to get an upgrade rather than keeping old gear would be to have the old gear's stats cease to function after a certain level or at a certain point in time. &quot;Valid only until level XX&quot; and all. This is STILL an ugly 'fix.'<br />
<br />
Also, with an Item Squish, the content will need to be tuned accordingly, and that means that we will not necessarily easily blow through lvl 60 Blackwing Lair at lvl 85 like we do right now -- retro runs can become harder, and less desirable to run. People run these because they CAN obliterate them easily, it's part of the fun.</div></div><hr />

But you'd still be doing the same amount of damage - the article says that. It would only be the numbers you're seeing that have changed. If I'm reading it right.<br />
<br />
This part here:<br />
<br />
<br />
In other words, your Fireball will still do the same percentage damage to a player or a creature that it does today, but the number would be smaller. Logically, this seems like it would work, and it does. But it feels weird.

I don't think you're right. They're talking about leveling and that the difference between level 49 and 50 will be less significant than it was before.<br />
<br />
If you jump from itelevel 400 to 410 today, it will be the same relative increase as 500 to 501 because the boss HP won't increase at the old rate, but at the new rate. Only the numbers are going to be lower.</div></div><hr />

I saw just keep the stats on a consistant increase without any MAJOR jumps like they do every expansion.<br />
<br />
They HAVE to do that though or else the first tier(s) of raid content are complete jokes to anyone who completed the final tier of the previous expansion.<br />
<br />
Example: Heroic LK dropped 271 gear. First tier of Cata raiding dropped 359. That's 88 ilvl difference. Now, imagine you just cut that difference in half. That would mean that the first tier of raiding would be 44 ilvls above that of the final tier of the expansion before. You'd end up with ilvl 315 gear being dropped in this hypothetical first tier raid. Now, let's look at what that equates to in-game. That's about 2nd tier dungeons (Stonecore and Vortex Pinnacle). Now, I don't know how many of you had Heroic ICC gear, but you didn't replace that very quickly AT ALL. Stonecore and Vortex Pinnacle were jokes for most if you had that much gear. To make this gap between expansions smaller than it already is would severely drop the difficulty and satisfaction of raiding at the beginning of an expansion, an issue that was ALREADY a problem in Cataclysm.</div></div><hr />

For example if we reduce from 120k to 20k, that means everything is going down to approx 17% of what it is currently. Lets take Mekgineer Thurmaplugg for an example. He has his hp reduced to 17% of what it is, therefore has 1173 hp (originally 6900). Now he his mean to take about 1 min to kill (ish). So 1173/60 so 19.55. 19.55 is the group dps required to make the encounter last long enough. Split that between 4 players (tanks do same as dps at this level) then that's 4.88 dps per damage dealer. At a dungeon level advised to be 24-34. That's just rediculous. That would mean that from 1-24 you'd be doing less than 4.5 dps... They're gonna have to do something about that.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Were finding it harder to create more an more addictive versions of crack to sell our junkies&quot;<br />
&quot;I know, tell them that all the crack they had before was actually all the same crack, and that in the NEW expansion, the crack's going to be EVEN better!&quot;<br />
<br />
The game needs to be less about trading up on pixels, and more about doing things that are actually entertaining. Can an MMO as big as WoW, with as much momentum as it has, actually change direction?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I second this. However, they mentioned before that this change would make it so that mobs 5-10 levels below you would be much more difficult then they would be currently due to the slope of the curve. So I think in general it will make old content harder to solo.</div></div><hr />

For example if we reduce from 120k to 20k, that means everything is going down to approx 17% of what it is currently. Lets take Mekgineer Thurmaplugg for an example. He has his hp reduced to 17% of what it is, therefore has 1173 hp (originally 6900). Now he his mean to take about 1 min to kill (ish). So 1173/60 so 19.55. 19.55 is the group dps required to make the encounter last long enough. Split that between 4 players (tanks do same as dps at this level) then that's 4.88 dps per damage dealer. At a dungeon level advised to be 24-34. That's just rediculous. That would mean that from 1-24 you'd be doing less than 4.5 dps... They're gonna have to do something about that.<br />
<br />
But if you read thaey are squishing 60+. The graph itself shows the same line on pre and post squish. 0-60 will be 0-60 as it always is, then 60+ will be more in line with that level of 'growth'</div></div><hr />

<br />
Example: Heroic LK dropped 271 gear. First tier of Cata raiding dropped 359. That's 88 ilvl difference. Now, imagine you just cut that difference in half. That would mean that the first tier of raiding would be 44 ilvls above that of the final tier of the expansion before. You'd end up with ilvl 315 gear being dropped in this hypothetical first tier raid. Now, let's look at what that equates to in-game. That's about 2nd tier dungeons (Stonecore and Vortex Pinnacle). Now, I don't know how many of you had Heroic ICC gear, but you didn't replace that very quickly AT ALL. Stonecore and Vortex Pinnacle were jokes for most if you had that much gear. To make this gap between expansions smaller than it already is would severely drop the difficulty and satisfaction of raiding at the beginning of an expansion, an issue that was ALREADY a problem in Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
But you do know that the stonecore and vortex items would have lowered stats as well thus being again in the exactly same situation as you were before the squish?<br />
<br />
The problem with cataclysm was that the old content remained the same while the new content wasnt adjusted perfectly</div></div><hr />

<br />
Old content is easy to solo now because of the VAST difference in ilvl eg 200 ilvls if you reduced that to 20 ilvls then you would only have say 20 more str over a char doing it as current content. Even with the nerf to %s of health and armor etc its still going to be a LOT harder to solo stuff.<br />

Even though the big numbers are always great to see, I speak for myself when I say whether I crit for 90k or 10k, if it's a big crit for that expansion, then I'll be excited for it. It's all about %'s anyway. For the people who are worried about soloing old content my only response is, it's an mmorpg. The idea would be for you to start becoming social and get friends to do the content with. It will bring back the social aspect of the game knowing that you'll need more people to do old content and not just become anti-social. Not to mention I play a warlock. It's not fair that I can solo old content up to a certain point and then a deathknight just blows thru most of old content (and some this expac old content *see atramedes*). Everyone has their own opinion, but mine is this is a game focused on a community of people doing stuff. Squish the items and bring back the community in WoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really just trying to understand this.<br />
<br />
Look at the first graph. See that HUGE difference between the gear at the end of one expansion and the gear in the next? Okay, now look at the 2nd graph. See how those are a LOT closer together now? That means that relative to the previous content, your gear (and therefore your character) won't be ridiculously more powerful, meaning that that older content will be more difficult than it is today. It'll have the same difficulty AT LEVEL as it did originally, but going back and trying to solo it later will be much more difficult since you're not scaling as quickly past it as you get newer and newer gear.</div></div><hr />

Most people like big numbers, the bigger the better, your character should feel significantly more powerful at max level than it did and the previous max level and they know they run the risk of losing A LOT of people if they were to knock everyone back down significantly, I don't care what anyone says, it would simply feel wrong being at Wrath level stats/DPS at 90. They should just smooth the scaling out a bit. Besides, it's Blizzard's fault, they brought up the problem in Wrath and then released Cataclysm with the biggest leap in stats in the game, partially because they compressed 10 levels into five, they also made changes that were supposedly for PVP in the huge HP inflation and also partially because they inflated item levels too much. They could have made upgrades upgrades without big stat differences if they just stuck with making new items simply better itemized with each tier.</div></div><hr />

This will mean only one thing : BIG NERF ! forget solo (or mini grouping) old content to farm mounts or transmo armor. BT would need 10 people minimum at least. Also, I don't get it, what you have against big numbers. I think it is fun to hit for 600k dmg. I don't have any prob with that.

You explained it just fine. When you cut everything down by a flat % (Like most people in this thread seem to think Blizzard will do), the difference in those numbers is still the same % wise, but the real difference is much smaller, 10 is 50% of 20, 100k is 50% of 200k.<br />

They can't just flip a switch and scale down everything, or Cataclysm will still have a ridiculous jump.</div></div><hr />

If Illidan has say 5million HP now and you do 30k DPS<br />

He will have 500,000 HP then and you do 3k DPS.<br />

Nothing will change, as long as blizzard accurately apply the same relative scaling to all bosses HP and Damage right back to vanilla as they do to characters. Obviously if they only did this to players then things would be messy, but I doubt they would.<br />
<br />
Things only really got out of control in Icecrown imo. The gaps were much, much smaller until then. Then suddenly icecrown set a new precedent of increases with the 30% buff aswell, and then shit really hit the fan in cata. The damage and hp we were seeing at the end of icecrown should have been the dmg we get in cata now imo, but it got way out of hand somehow along the way.</div></div><hr />

It's not 5 more levels. Though your character only gains 5 levels, that is actually paled in comparison to how much their stats grow from the 88 ilvls of gear they get while leveling.</div></div><hr />

Illidan comes along and is THREATENING THE UNIVERSE WITH DOOM, he is pure evil and looks like NOONE can stop him. We get geared to the teeth, bring 24 other people along, and GASP, we kill him. Then Sunwell comes and OMG NOONE CAN STOP HIM EITHER, we gear a bit more, and kill him. We are the most powerful people in the universe. Then Wotlk comes out, and a level 71 player is doing more damage in greens than the crazy geared people at 70 were doing. Their power was INSTANTLY diminished to the point where the gear they got become negligible. The Lich King came along and now HE CANNOT BE STOPPED BY ANYONE AHHHHH. Thus far, WoW has taken the Dragonball Z standpoint, where every badguy is just a retarded amount more powerful than the last guy. Not saying theres anything wrong with it, but I do think that a players gear at 85 should at least make a decent leveling set until 90 with set bonuses and weird detailed trinkets. If a lvl 85 heroic 4.3 item has +500 int on it, the raiding stuff at 90 should start out with 600-650. It IS better, noone in their right mind will stick with their 85 gear, but it isnt THAT much better; going from +500 to +4,500 is just silly. I think a +40-60 itemlevel progression makes much more sense than a +200, and watching a clothies health go from 5k, to 10k, to 30k, to 150k just doesnt make sense, especially this expansion (seems like the jump from 30k to 150k is uh...a bit extreme). So yes, I vote squishing and I'd rather see it sooner than later to get used to it now and if people hate it well TOO BAD coz you all already made your WoW commitment for the free Diablo :P</div></div><hr />

Whilst &quot;The Squish&quot; definitely seems like 'best' long-term solution, I think there should be (imho ofc) some compromise or added feature to the squish that retains a part of the awesomeness of the BIG numbers.My suggestion would be to obviously go with the squish for all internal data (server &amp; client side) to reduce the pointless computation overhead that is inherent with large numbers. Along with the squish, they should still maintain - a simple mapping (f.ex. ) b/w- the 'squished' number format (f.ex. 20k HP) - and the current number format (f.ex. 200k HP)This means that the client could always display 20k-HP as something like 200!mega-HP (example copied fer teh lulz).A system of the above nature could solve the over inflation problem for the long-term, whilst still maintaining a positive momentum of character power progression between the time before the change and after the change.</div></div><hr />

In fact, i was expecting it at the end of WotLK, since it was clear that stats, hp, damage and numbers in general were goin up wild. Every expansion should be a reset of gear, since we get new content, new items, and so on. Big nerfbat on old content should be a decent solution, since the problem is confined on how steep is the growth. Anyway this brings on the table lots of problems, let's see what they have in mind.<br />
<br />
This was unavoidable with Blizzard's the insistence of &quot;gear resets&quot; every content patch, to much emphasis the be placed on the gear and less on the content/design. I would have liked to seen &quot;gear overlap&quot; vs &quot;gear reset&quot; this desire for the developers to force people to upgrade is misguided at best and completely wrong/destructive at worse.<br />
<br />
Gear overlap is were the top level gear from the previous tier is slight better then the normal level gear from the current tier within expansions and the Top level tier of the Previous expansion is still viable as entry level gear in the current expansion. Gear overlap would allow players catch up by buying previous tier armor from Badge vendors while not forcing anyone to upgrade merely based on iLevel and controlling the explosion of stats.<br />
<br />
Example... (iLevel are NOT Accurate for current game content, this is an example)<br />
Vinilla:<br />
- Entry Gear: iLevel 55-60 <br />
--- Tier 1 (N) : iLevel 65<br />
--- Tier 1 (H) : iLevel 72<br />
--- Tier 2 (N) : iLevel 70<br />
--- Tier 2 (H) : iLevel 77<br />
--- Tier 3 (N) : iLevel 75<br />
--- Tier 3 (H) : iLevel 82<br />
Burning Crusade:<br />
- Entry Gear: iLevel 80-85 <br />
--- Tier 1 (N) : iLevel 90<br />
--- Tier 1 (H) : iLevel 97<br />
--- Tier 2 (N) : iLevel 95<br />
--- Tier 2 (H) : iLevel 102<br />
--- Tier 3 (N) : iLevel 100<br />
--- Tier 3 (H) : iLevel 107<br />
Wrath:<br />
- Entry Gear: iLevel 105-110 <br />
--- Tier 1 (N) : iLevel 115<br />
--- Tier 1 (H) : iLevel 122<br />
--- Tier 2 (N) : iLevel 120<br />
--- Tier 2 (H) : iLevel 127<br />
--- Tier 3 (N) : iLevel 125<br />
--- Tier 3 (H) : iLevel 132<br />

It would only be the numbers you're seeing that have changed. If I'm reading it right.<br />
<br />
This part here:<br />
The issue for &quot;old content&quot; is not the players as they level, it is the players that are at max level and hitting old content. Take a look at level 60 on the chart. The gear really isn't changing at that level. Thus in Molten Core the loot that drops there and the tuning of the bosses will not change one bit. BWL/AQ might get slight tweaks but not much if any. So a level 60 today would see zero change as there is nothing to change.<br />
<br />
However as a level 85, I would see a change in my run through that instance. My gear is easily going to drop 200 ilvls. So yeah I'll have less health and do less damage. So therefore, the difficulty of Molten Core is going to increase. Will it be tough? Not likely. But I might not be able to solo it like I could today.<br />
<br />
This is something that will happen up the chain. TBC bosses will start seeing nerfs to their health, but a Cata player is going to get nerfed significantly more than those bosses were so therefore they would be harder than they are today. Things should feel more inline with Wrath content, but I would argue it will still be slightly more difficult. The Cata content should have the same degree of difficulty.<br />
<br />
<br />
In any case I am in favor of the shrinking thing. Do it every patch before each expansion to keep the silly inflation in line.</div></div><hr />

Those are real nerf, not just &quot;a feeling&quot;. Nerf for real the dps/tanks at the begin of the next expansion, Welcome to the Club !<br />
<br />
Do you really think tanks care what spells they are healed with? The healing changes was for healers, no one else. You know why? Because healing was completely and utterly broken. You had to heal with 1 spell, and you had to have paladins heal with that spell, else you could not succeed. It forced weird gameplay, weird gearing and anything that counted was throughput, throughput, throughput. Yes, it affected tanks, but only because the healing mechanics was so broken, that it made tank itemization useless. Avoidance might as well not have existed in WotLK.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SleepySlug</div><div class="date">2011-11-04, 05:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Neither solution is particularly elegant. As he highlights in the article, a level 80 piece of gear will not be a great jump from level 60, let alone 70. It can lead to people holding onto old gear and bypassing content, etc, etc, as he also mentioned. To put it into perspective, imagine if the gear you got in Tier 11 at the start of Cata was only a mite bit less powerful than the newest and latest in 4.3?<br />
<br />
Please take into account the current expansion section of that 2nd graph. This is an issue they've already thought of and the solution is not to include current expansion content in the squish. So while older gear will have ilvls that differ by less, rate of growth within the current expansion would remain relatively unchanged. 4.3 gear would still be a good upgrade over 4.1 gear.<br />
<br />
I'd also assume that if a squish solution was adopted that it'd also be taken into account that it would be a process that would be repeated on a semi-regular basis. Although, keep in mind that further iterations of squishes would not need to take older content into account, only that of that newly replaced xpac.</div></div><hr />

For instance (just a off my head example) you could have a buff thats only present when you are wearing all ilvl 600 gear, like the buffs u get now for wearing all leather. Like maybe the new bosses require less dps but they require a resistance or so, thats not present on the gear itself but that you get when you are wearing a full set. If you didnt have the full set you'd die every boss move. I understand its kinda pointless to give every boss the same buff though its just an idea to work along those lines, if you HAD to wear level 90 gear to do level 90 dungeons some how, then ud still be able to solo old content because those raids wouldnt have the restrictions so you could wear lvl 85 gear for those.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As I said, I personally think it's a good idea (Though I'd be sad to lose my big numbers), the backlash from it would be insane.<br />
<br />
One thing I do immensely dislike about it is, it will make Old Content challenging again. Some people might like this, but personally I like the fact that I can faceroll my way through TBC and WoTLK raids with a small number of people to get Transmog gear.<br />
<br />
I'm sure it's weird in the beginning, but we will adept like we did with all those item levels. There was a time were 20 strength was much, now it's less than the difference between normal and heroic version.<br />

It's the only way and i hope they go for the squish.</div></div><hr />

Acutally from your example it's (6x10^4) or (6e4). I point this out not to be a prick, only because lots of people WoW age end up bombing science tests based simply on not knowing how to use a calculator, while knowing how to do the actual math correctly.<br />

On topic: Squish!<br />

Allow the same increased curve for the next xpac, so that you are getting rewarded strong with ilvl jumps. But then before an xpac launches, squish the numbers down and decrease the disparity between a fresh max level and a fully-raided max level right before the level grind of the next xpac.<br />

That is precisely what the item squish mechanic was outlined to do. Note the cata jump (as we are still in cata) in the final graph.</div></div><hr />

Just adding on something tiny like cata -&gt; Pandas 10% dmg buff people will still notice and be ok with, we dont have to go from 30k - 30million dps surely.

The problem with cataclysm was that the old content remained the same while the new content wasnt adjusted perfectly<br />

It's an issue of relativity. I mention the Stonecore and Vortex Pinnacle instances as examples for what a RAID'S difficulty would be if those differences were cut in half, not of the difficulty of those instances. Obviously those would be even EASIER.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem with cataclysm was that the old content remained the same while the new content wasnt adjusted perfectly<br />
<br />
The thing is, older raids and such would become more difficult. <br />
<br />
Let's say a 40 man raid boss at level 60 had 1 million health, and a baseline level 60 player had 5000 hp, and they're doing, say 600dps. there's a major difference between player and boss, despite both being at 100% stat power. Once a player reaches level 85, they've got 150k hp and they're doing 30k dps. That level 60 boss has only 6.66x the hp of the player, and produces negligible damage.<br />
<br />
Once the Squish occurs, the level 85 player only has 20k hp (1/50th of the boss) and puts out 3k dps. The Vanilla raid boss's damage/HP wouldn't likely change any, as they were implemented into a linear system and wouldn't need to be adjusted.<br />
<br />
40 man raid bosses would be difficult (or at the least, very time consuming) at almost any character level, simply due to the character to boss ratio (40:1). 25 man bosses would be more difficult to guess at, as they were all produced under the exponential model.</div></div><hr />

For example the mob could loose a hand in a fight due to a crit. But yes, there is no point of being able to hit for gigatons of damage, because that would be like the player is some kind of a god. In pen &amp; paper games there are max level. After that players get more power instead of more skill. By power I mean players become landlords, then earls, then kings... And then they die! A human can reach only so much in his life. You can't live forever and train all the time and gather muscles of an ore carrier truck. And you can't get muscles of an ore carrier truck in like 50 years either. So make the rewards be something else than better items or levels. Otherwise you do end up squishing things / having those massive numbers. Warriors could gather land, buildings, settlements, and an army. Mages could gather land, mage tower, mystical caves, and golems. And so on. Propably we won't see most of these other approaches in Wow, because &quot;Wow is not meant to be all-in-one-game&quot;. But there you have the options.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barreveler</div><div class="date">2011-11-04, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, like, say I just finished soloing the Shattered Halls heroic, most mobs there have 20-100k HP, would that go down if my character's health was reverted from 120k to 20k?<br />
<br />
Yes. <br />
<br />
Theoretically the proportions should remain the same. If mobs in Heroic Shattered Halls are 70 elites and have 20k health, and you're 85 and have 120k health. Assume a 90% proportional reduction of all stats (which would be extreme) you would have 12,000 health at 85 and the mobs would have 2000 health. <br />
<br />
Likewise, if you were doing 30k DPS at 85, you'd do about 3k dps post squish. You'd still one or two shot mobs in Heroic Shattered Halls, but everything would be scaled lower.<br />
<br />
However, gear introduces scaling problems. Suppose we take 1 Burning Crusade weapon that has +20 strength, and another that has +26 strength. Reducing that by 90% you run into the problem that if the gear has &quot;whole stats,&quot; you now have a gear with +2 strength and a piece of gear with ?? what? + 3 strength? the scaling issue just made that piece much more powerful. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SleepySlug</div><div class="date">2011-11-04, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You explained it just fine. When you cut everything down by a flat % (Like most people in this thread seem to think Blizzard will do), the difference in those numbers is still the same % wise, but the real difference is much smaller, 10 is 50% of 20, 100k is 50% of 200k.<br />
<br />
They can't just flip a switch and scale down everything, or Cataclysm will still have a ridiculous jump.<br />
<br />
It wouldn't be a flat %. Again, look at the proposed graph. Now I know this isn't exact numbers or anything, but if you want to squish things into a closer curve, the things furthest out are going to change the most. What this means in English: TBC gear will change the least, Wrath gear would experience a larger change than that, Cata gear would experience and even bigger change, etc. until they reached current content which would just be slid on top of it with a more familiar curve that we're used to seeing within a current expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Theoretically the proportions should remain the same. If mobs in Heroic Shattered Halls are 70 elites and have 20k health, and you're 85 and have 120k health. Assume a 90% proportional reduction of all stats (which would be extreme) you would have 12,000 health at 85 and the mobs would have 2000 health. <br />
<br />
Likewise, if you were doing 30k DPS at 85, you'd do about 3k dps post squish. You'd still one or two shot mobs in Heroic Shattered Halls, but everything would be scaled lower.<br />
<br />
However, gear introduces scaling problems. Suppose we take 1 Burning Crusade weapon that has +20 strength, and another that has +26 strength. Reducing that by 90% you run into the problem that if the gear has &quot;whole stats,&quot; you now have a gear with +2 strength and a piece of gear with ?? what? + 3 strength? the scaling issue just made that piece much more powerful. <br />
<br />
This is the problem that would make old instances incrementally harder and content higher than you would be incrementally easier.<br />
<br />
You've fundamentally misunderstood this problem and the solution.<br />
The reductions will NOT BE LINEAR. Level 70 mobs WILL be harder for you to kill at 85 than they are now. That's the whole point. This isn't just to reduce big numbers, this is to smooth out the game scaling, so older content isn't as trivial. The increases in power have NOT BEEN LINEAR. 0-60 is almost completely LINEAR, with the exception of T3 where we spiked up to ilvl 90 for some things.<br />
<br />
Since then we have spiked up insanely. It's these reductions that will be reduced, and your overall relative power will be reduced. Thinking it will be a flat 90% reduction is completely wrong. NO FLAT REDUCTIONS.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maccaruso</div><div class="date">2011-11-04, 05:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing is, older raids and such would become more difficult. <br />
<br />
Let's say a 40 man raid boss at level 60 had 1 million health, and a baseline level 60 player had 5000 hp, and they're doing, say 600dps. there's a major difference between player and boss, despite both being at 100% stat power. Once a player reaches level 85, they've got 150k hp and they're doing 30k dps. That level 60 boss has only 6.66x the hp of the player, and produces negligible damage.<br />
<br />
Once the Squish occurs, the level 85 player only has 20k hp (1/50th of the boss) and puts out 3k dps. The Vanilla raid boss's damage/HP wouldn't likely change any, as they were implemented into a linear system and wouldn't need to be adjusted.<br />
<br />
40 man raid bosses would be difficult (or at the least, very time consuming) at almost any character level, simply due to the character to boss ratio (40:1). 25 man bosses would be more difficult to guess at, as they were all produced under the exponential model.<br />
<br />
That's a bit incorrect. The &quot;squish&quot; would happen to mobs as well. Using your given example above the player's health is reduced rougly 7.5x (150 K to 20K) which mens Ragnaros would go from 1 million health to roughly 133.3K health (1 million/7.5).<br />
<br />
Blizzard would have to keep everything relative.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZenX</div><div class="date">2011-11-04, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Or you can adapt the style of having the larger health pools and numbers with reducing the digits to an abbreviated form(K for 1000, or 2^10 to be more precise) for where you just ignore the lower digits for the sake of reducing the needed effort of calculation... For example, suppose in the case of that ilvl 750 piece of item, assuming a player wearing gear on par with it will have around 366K attack power, or 0,36M attack power, now at this point suppose I am to crit with an ability outputting something 4xtimes more than this number of 1.830K or 1,83M. However, this is similar to how we had and attack power of 366 and did 1.830 or 1,83K damage, hence, my proposal would be to keep the big numbers in terms of the player sees it(omg 1M crit) whereas adapting a notation where digits below 1K are truncated(essentially zeros), and similarly 1M count when we are on the order of those numbers. Some may ask whether how can this be handled with lower level gear and transitions? There are two alternatives to it: 1 - This would require the player to be more aware : Any item used that has its required equip level smaller than the character's current level by 5 levels will act as a gray quality item. 2 - This may be a harder modification to be done on the engine, and a bit more fancier to handle: Change the items’ stat representation with an equation of “Stat = Modifier*ilvl”, and otherwise it is a case of displaying the stats, the engine responsible for the calculation will be only concerned with the modifier and will handle the calculation with this modifier parameter, though, I need to make some serious calculations to how to list this modifier and its growth level. TL;DR: Trick us into doing billions or zillions of damage, while handling the computing with numbers of 3 or 4 orders smaller than them, aka always deal with number of 4 significant figures or 4 digits(1,234 or 4321 etc.) for the calculations. Edit: In addition, for the prevention of players one-shotting bosses, apply the modifier of challenge mode for anyone who's entering the raid instances of past expansions with them being tuned for 10-man mode, and player tuned to be on the appropriate level(e.g t11 heroic gear on lvl 80 for ICC), thought this may not be viewed well by many people(sorry mione) So no more soloing of raids...&quot;</div></div><hr />

Everything (stats, health pools, damage &amp; healing down) is cut down by the same amount, so it would just like loving the decimal one place to the left. You going from having 100,000 health hitting a target with 1,000,000 for 25,000 to something like 10,000 health hitting a target with 1000,000 for 2,500. I'm sure people will make an addon to add an extra 0 or two to the combat log to make you feel more powerful.<br />
<br />
You do not understand what is happening.<br />
<br />
<br />
Vanilla raids were designed for lv. 60 players.<br />
Level 70 players are roughly three times stronger than level 60 players.<br />
Level 80 players are roughly three times stronger than level 70 players.<br />
Level 85 players are roughly three times stronger than level 85 players.<br />
<br />
You can solo Molten Core, because you equal about thirty level 60 players all by yourself.<br />
<br />
What the item squish would do, would be to get rid of the massive increases between lv 60 and lv 80.<br />
Lv 70 characters won't be vastly superior to lv. 60s. Level 80 characters won't be vastly superior to 70s.<br />
<br />
However, the raids will still be tuned to their appropriate level.<br />
<br />
<br />
Right now, the difference between lv 60 and lv. 70 is about the same difference between lv. 1 and lv.60. The same goes for 70 to 80.<br />
What the item squish does is change it so the difference between lv. 60 and lv. 70 is the same as the difference between lv. 50 and lv. 60.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Basically, don't expect to solo anything you couldn't solo one expansion earlier.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ryme</div><div class="date">2011-11-04, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right now, they just need a simple piecewise function to allow gear to increase from expansion to expansion but at a linear rate, or perhaps you could get away with some slight exponential growth depending on how much effort you want to put into the function.<br />
<br />
The discontinuity from each point just needs to be sufficient enough that gear from old expansions still sucks when we change to the new one.</div></div><hr />

I know it wouldn't be a flat % change, but the people arguing about Old Content are saying &quot;Oh it's fine just cut Illidans Health, Your Health and Damage to 10%, IT'S ALL THE SAME WITH SMALLER NUMBERS&quot; when this is nothing like it would be. <br />

a simpler fix would be to just scale up to that point slowly. if they rush into it then they are burying themselves to jst get up to ludicrous amounts of stats like in the second picture. why do we need a massive jump or a reset on our stats?</div></div><hr />

Honestly though, I see the squish as the best way forwards. It needs to happen for the good of the game. Also the technical reasons given are valid, if every calculation starts needing to be done with 512bit numbers (ass number I know..) it will have a small effect on performance, not least on the servers, from calculation times to even just database load times.</div></div><hr />

You do less damage, have less HP -- and so does the boss.If they scale only level's 60+ down -- then, and only then, will any content get harder.<br />
<br />
If you look at the graph they made, it clearly depicts vanilla at ilevel 60, BC at ilevel 70, and wotlk at ilevel 80, cata up to ilevel 170'ish at last tier. With a squish like that, yes, old content will be more challenging. You will have a 10 itemlevel difference between BC and WotLK, instead of 150. You would gain almost no stats from level 60 to 70, and a BC dungeon would not be soloable for a level 80 character.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">valenwood</div><div class="date">2011-11-04, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the stats on items don't have to change with a squish, per se. you can keep every item in the game the same, and grow them the same, as the 6.3 example, even. but just make the damage those items produce go down, divide all damage, healing and health pools by 100. this way gear can increase at the same weight, we don't have to nerf all the old gear, and the solution of having large numbers in the threat stack, or damage stack, get relieved. like if i skill currently has a damage formula of something like <br />
<br />
damage = AP*1.20 + .4*weapon damage.<br />
<br />
this would now be: <br />
<br />
Damage = AP/100 * 1.20 + (.0004)* weapon damage<br />
<br />
the issue is less seeing 10000 str on a weapon (relatively small number for a computer to use), as it is having the servers compute trillions of threat points, that's a lot of significant figures. wrath gear would still be able to be 20 tr vrs 26 str, but all stats just affect things less. we would all have smaller health pools (some rounding here would occur, but on the order of 1 part in 100) and do less damage, but still not have to worry about fractions of a strength.</div></div><hr />
