The Secret Finding Discord has figured out the Hivemind Mount!<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/december/hmBanner.jpg (https://warcraft-secrets.com/guides/the-hivemind) <br />
<br />
You will need a group of at least five players to acquire The Hivemind (https://www.wowdb.com/items/156798-the-hivemind). There are many pugs going in LFG. You should all have the same warmode setting while working on the puzzle together. <br />
<br />
Step 1 - Purchase and equip the Talisman of True Treasure Tracking (https://www.wowdb.com/items/27944-talisman-of-true-treasure-tracking). This is obtained Griftah (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/19227-griftah) in Shattrath. Keep this equipped for the entire puzzle. <br />
<br />
Step 2 - Acquire the colored crystal monocles. <br />
Note: Players have reported that your party only needs one of each monocle, but each one should be held by a different player. According to these reports you do not have to acquire any of these monocles personally to unlock The Hivemind (https://www.wowdb.com/items/156798-the-hivemind). It is possible to join a group of four players who have these monocles already, but who have not completed the Suramar Beams, and join them at that step.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Green Crystal Monocle - complete the Skyreach puzzle. <br />
At the end of the Skyreach dungeon, you can interact with the Basic Instructions banner. <br />
Interact with the small glowing orb on the console and colored lights will appear in the distance. <br />
Use the console to perform the following sequence: Right - Up - Down - Up - Right - Right - Up - Left - Down - Up - Left - Down <br />
A chest will appear at the top of the console, loot the Green Crystal Monocle. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yellow Crystal Monocle - complete the Halls of Origination puzzle. <br />
Enter the Halls of Origination and take the stairs on the right. When you’ve reached the elevator jump down to interact with the Stellar Refraction device. <br />
Click each constellation that appears to change the colors of other constellations nearby. Once they are all the same color, the chest will spawn containing the Yellow Crystal Monocle. <br />
An addon has been developed (https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/hivemind-hoo-puzzle-helper) to help solve this puzzle.<br />
Note that you can invite players to your party after the puzzle has been solved, and they too can loot the chest containing the monocle. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Crystal Monocle - complete the letter puzzle. <br />
You will need to read letters located all over Azeroth. <br />
Letter #1 - Shattrath at 65,69 behind Griftah. <br />
Letter #2 - Highmountain at 57.41, 27.91 on top a wood crate.<br />
Letter #3 - Karazhan raid on a table in Medivh's Chambers.<br />
Letter #4 - Razorfen Downs at the end of the instance on a table.<br />
Letter #5 - Mount Hyjal at 44.41, 46.65 at the top of the tree.<br />
Letter #6 - Icecrown at 70.73, 73.35 near the border of Crystalsong Forest.<br />
Letter #7 - Townlong Steppes at 37.7, 63 near the base of the structure.<br />
Go to Borean Tundra to the top of The Nexus and loot the Gift from Ms. Graham (https://www.wowdb.com/objects/280845-gift-from-ms-graham) at 27.45, 27.12 to acquire the Blue Crystal Monocle. <br />
<br />
<br />
Step 3 - Disabling the Suramar Beams. <br />
In Suramar at 41, 69.5 there are four colored beams, one for each monocle. <br />
There are also 4 withered NPCs that correspond to each beam / monocle. <br />
Rikei (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/132595-rikei) (red) located at 71.86, 62.57<br />
Blom’an (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/132596-bloman) (blue) located at 46.89, 28.61.<br />
Giluzui (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/132597-giluzui)(green) located at 19.95, 46.39.<br />
Yorilan (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/132598-yorilan) (yellow) located at 43.58, 81.82. <br />
Each member of your party must be at a different withered, equipped with the corresponding colored monocle. Equipping the monocle will make the withered hostile to you. The remaining player will stand by the doorway with the colored beams.<br />
Bringing the withered down to 1% HP will cause it to cast Draw Energy. This will cause that withered’s color beam to briefly be removed from the doorway.<br />
The 4 members of your group handling the withered must carefully time bringing the NPCs down to 1%, while the fifth player stands near the doorway, waiting to go in. <br />
Once all beams are down, the 5th player must quickly get to the dresser and interact with the Lost Cat Toy (https://www.wowdb.com/objects/280903-lost-cat-toy). <br />
This will cause the player to be teleported out and take damage. Make note of the amount of damage taken, as this is required to complete the next step. <br />
<br />
<br />
Step 4 - Lady Chaton in the Court of Stars<br />
Take the entire group to Lady Chaton (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/132599-lady-chaton) in the Court of Stars (https://www.wowdb.com/zones/8079-court-of-stars). There are numerous manakittens that can be pet. Each time you pet a kitten it gets a stack of Purring (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/261364-purring) for 15 seconds. <br />
The damage the 5th player in your party took when getting teleported out of the Suramar room is the number of stacks you must apply to different cats. <br />
The order of the cats compared to the damage taken is Fluffy, Shadow, Mew, Ash and Bella. For example, if the player in your group took 15904 damage then you would need 1 stack on Fluffy, 5 stacks on Shadow, 9 stacks on Mew, 0 stacks on Ash and 4 stacks on Bella. <br />
If the damage taken was only 4 digits long, ignore Fluffy. <br />
If the damage taken was only 3 digits long, Ignore Fluffy and Shadow.<br />
Make sure to start with the cat that has the highest stacks needed, as the stacks quickly drop after 15 seconds. <br />
Once all necessary cats have their required stacks, an orb will appear. Click it to be teleported to the next puzzle. <br />
<br />
<br />
Step 5 - The Jumping Puzzle<br />
All five players will need to get to the other side of the room through the jumping puzzle. <br />
Assign each player in your group a position, from 1 to 5, and follow this jumping guide (https://imgur.com/a/74diE8r).<br />
With all five players across, walk up to the door together. When all players are at the door it can be opened.<br />
<br />
<br />
Final Step - The Arcane Crossing<br />
Stand about 4-5 steps from top of the stairs. <br />
The objective is to get all five players over to the other side, by riding the lightlock disc.<br />
Nobody can cross solo. There is a single combination of 3 players within your group that can cross together. The rest will cross in pairs of two.<br />
One person is capable of crossing with any other player. Think of them as the &quot;anchor&quot; player.<br />
Mark each player in the raid with an icon. Through trial and error, send two people at a time onto the disc.<br />
When a pair makes it across, one of them is the anchor. Do some more trial and error to figure out which one it is.<br />
Once you have identified the person who can cross with anyone (the anchor), you must now identify the group of three people that can cross together. This will be the only group of three capable of crossing at the same time. It will consist of the anchor player + two other members in your group. Call this the &quot;trio&quot;. Use trial and error again.<br />
Once you have identified the trio that can cross together, you are nearly complete. <br />
The anchor player will always stay on the disc, and only come off in the final step.<br />
With the trio on the disc, drop one of the two non-anchor players off at the finish. You now have two people on the disc. (anchor + one member of the trio)<br />
Drop the other member of the trio back off at the start, and pick up another regular group member. Take them to the finish, where they will get off, and the member of the trio who was at the finish will get back on. <br />
Both of these members will ride on the disc back to the start, and pick up the third member of the trio. Ride back to the finish, and drop a member of the trio off at the finish. You now have two members at the finish (one member of the trio, one regular member).<br />
The anchor and remaining member of the trio ride back to the start where the remaining member of the trio will hop off the disc, and pickup the other regular member of your party. Drop this person off at the finish, and pick up the member of the trio who was waiting at the finish. You should now have both &quot;regular&quot; members at the finish, the anchor and one trio member on the disc, and one trio member at the start. <br />
Ride the disc once more to the start, and pick up the last remaining of the trio. All three of you ride to the finish, and hop off at the same time. Approach the door as a group, and open it.<br />
Surrounding The Hivemind (https://www.wowdb.com/items/156798-the-hivemind) are five shadowy pools. Each member must stand in a different pool and click on The Hivemind (https://www.wowdb.com/items/156798-the-hivemind). <br />
Once all players channel their spell at the same time, the mount will be yours!</div></div><hr />

Same, I mean it could happen but it kinda kills my motivation, esp for something so complicated. I remember doing the only the penitant achieve in fire lands which wasn't nearly that hard and was still painful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It isn't motivation for me, rather that by the time I get to that point in time - the simple act of trying to find 4 other people who are after the mount and who are all on EXACTLY the same phase in a long chain - that will be close to impossible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The people who say stuff like this are the people that don't actively try to find and put together a group. Its not close to impossible to get a group together because everyone will be looking for a group when they get to the part that requires a group. Stop being lazy or stop complaining.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">schwarzkopf</div><div class="date">2018-12-16, 03:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its not close to impossible to get a group <br />
<br />
So you are making the illogical assumption that everyone doing this will do it at EXACTLY the same rate, and that in 3 weeks when I get up to that point - that a whole stack of people will be up to that exact point in the chain as well.<br />
Or maybe they will know I'm coming and wait for me ... lol.<br />
<br />
As a comparison - when I was doing the Ba'al chain, I met a grand total of ONE other person doing the chain during the ENTIRE thing, and we were not on the same part.<br />
<br />
Be rational dude.</div></div><hr />

You only need the same group of people to complete it starting with the beams in the doorway in Suramar, to the end. Everything up to that point can be done alone.</div></div><hr />

Or maybe they will know I'm coming and wait for me ... lol.<br />
<br />
As a comparison - when I was doing the Ba'al chain, I met a grand total of ONE other person doing the chain during the ENTIRE thing, and we were not on the same part.<br />
<br />
Be rational dude.<br />
<br />
For this chain, when the group part starts, that’s it. You finish it with that group. I understand your point, but this isn’t the same as the riddle worm or the lucid nightmare. Those had a long chain of individual steps. Hivemind is solo monocles then a Court of Stars group.<br />
<br />
Yes, a whole stack of people will be at the colored barrier step. You need four separate monocles and the damage code you get is unique to your group. Once someone leaves, such as a group cycling a 5th person, you have to do the colored barrier again for a new damage code.<br />
<br />
Think of it like this. There are four keys to a door, behind the door is a short dungeon. Players can earn one key or all four (like old attunements), then find a group to put together one of each key. This group uses the keys, gets the code, then completes the dungeon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really. Technically all players without the mount are at the colored barrier step. All you really need is the griftah neck. I had zero monocles when I got my mount. Just get all four monocles and you’ll eventually find a group, or look for a group selling a 5th spot. Don’t make it any harder than it needs to be.</div></div><hr />

This is one of the few things they've done right in BFA. There needs to be more content like this - non-raid, non-PvP structured group content. This is an MMO, not a single-player game. Any excuse I have to continue to play the game with my friends is a good thing.</div></div><hr />

And apparently only the people who helped you get the hivemind can get on the same hivemind. So if you do it in a pug, chances are high that you'll never see these people again and this 5 person mount becomes a one person mount.</div></div><hr />

You missed the point. He wasn't criticizing people without the mount. He was saying that none of the steps prior to the Surumar beams is required for the 5th person in the group. Which means if you have a group of 4 with the monocles, anyone can be the fifth person. That's why he meant by &quot;Technically all players without the mount are at the colored barrier step&quot;. Just that they can step in the beams with no prior work and go from there.<br />
<br />
So now or at any time in the future, your needs to get this are a group with the monocles and a 5th body. Your chances of finding such a group are highest if you go get all 4 of the monocles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People have 1 1/2 years to get this mount. Just how in Legion there were people ALWAYS doing the most mundane of group tasks like farming shards, fishing reps, rare drops, etc. Once BFA came out, all the Legion farm groups disappeared. If in 1 1/2 years you arent motivated to get this mount, then accept the fact that you won't get it and move on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i'll be honest, i also prefer when things specifically like this are solo, but it's an online game so needing to group for it is fine by me. not only that but the grouping part of this is really quick, you get in a group through group finder, kill 4 things at the same time, pet some cats, hop around on some discs, and then hold hands to cross some purple stuff. the group part, using the guide, will take you less than an hour.<br />

<br />
I completed it in about 45 minutes with a pug. I only bothered to acquire the green monocle since that is the easiest one to get imo. I then joined a group that already had the yellow, red and blue, and we did everything from that point on (suramar beams, court of stars, jumping puzzle, and arcane bridge) together. Arcane bridge was the longest part as its trial and error to figure out the combination of people, which will be different for each group. Rest of it is static and just follow the guide to success.</div></div><hr />

There is nothing &quot;difficult&quot; other than the last part. Every other step is 100% static and you just read the guide and follow it.

Well if it's useless then you don't need it.<br />

Over 400 other mounts to go farm. God forbid one makes you work with people in an MMO.<br />

problem is completing it next week a lot of people will be done and it will be almost impossible to get the group going. <br />

Form your own group then. There were always going to be people selling it. Just like people who sold Alani before it was made a BoE mount. Or people who sold the one in Legion.<br />
<br />
When I make my group I ain't gonna charge people for it personally. Don't see the point.</div></div><hr />

You do not have to do any previous secrets. You do not have to even acquire all the monocles. You can just buy the neck and join a group that has the monocles already, and start the Suramar Beams step. Or if you want to get the monocles to experience all the puzzles, you certainly can. I opted to get one (the green one) as it was easiest, then formed my own group in group finder and invited someone with red, someone with blue, someone with yellow and my friend who did not have any monocle.</div></div><hr />

What crystals are you talking about? The only thing required to start working on any of the monocles is buying the necklace from Griftah.</div></div><hr />

There is only one thing to click after buying the neck, and that is the letter, and you only need to do that if you want to go for the blue monocole, which is not required ultimately to get the mount.</div></div><hr />

I vaguely remember reading somewhere that the red, green, and yellow objects behind Griftah were clickable teleports to their puzzles. I have yet to see proof, but those objects are not required for anything. You only need the blue piece of paper on the far right of the table behind Griftah for the blue letter chain. You are free to completely ignore the blue monocle chain, as long as the group you form or join has someone with a blue monocle.</div></div><hr />

1. Get the Griffath necklace (needed for later steps)<br />
2. If you're lucky, check for a group with a completed Halls of Origination event, you enter the dongeon and loot the chest.<br />

It's not about 'getting along.'<br />
<br />
It's that when this is no longer shiny and new, no one is going to want to do it. The people who want it will have already done it and won't do it again, and the people who don't want it... Well, they won't do it, pretty straight forward.<br />
<br />
I get along with everyone I've played with in game (with the exception of a couple hostile people) and even I know this is a bad way to implement a mount that people WILL want after this expansion is over. Unless they plan to nerf it to be soloable later, in which case, why not make it soloable now?<br />
<br />
As someone who quit because I wasn't enjoying BfA, this is rather sad. I either A) give them money for a product I deemed mediocre a long time ago so I can get it, or B) hope to christ it gets nerfed so I can solo it later, since no one will do it after BfA is over.</div></div><hr />

All of the mobs are separate, and need to be brought down to 1 health at the exact same time. In addition, the withered only channel the beam for a few seconds, giving very little time to get to the bookcase to get the item needed to continue.<br />
<br />
In other words: A solo player can obtain all four monocles and trade them probably, but IMMEDIATELY after the monocles are aquired, you need at least 5 people to continue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Getting all four crystal monocles can be done solo. An individual doesn't need to get all four crystal monocles though. The next step requires a five man party with four of your five party members each needing a different monocle. One person in your party won't need even a single monocle. <br />
<br />
Bringing down the barrier and beyond is the only mandatory group content of this mount.</div></div><hr />

This is patently false. At any time in the groupfinder there is usually a group available that is looking for people to do old achieves. As a matter of fact when I was looking for a group for this mount there were still groups looking to do the kneeling achieve from firelands and the fishing achieves from Legion.</div></div><hr />

I agree that the 5 man requirement is fine for right now, but in 2 years it will be extremely difficult to find 4 people willing to do this if they already have the mount. Not sure what the best resolution is to that. Certainly not another endless halls, that REALLY was not fun.</div></div><hr />

Sad cause there were groups sellin the green and yellow monocles. haha While there were groups offering free yellow chest. The green one was cake to do.

We had an awesome group as well. took about 2.5h or so from beams to mount. There were LOTS of groups on the cats parts. We were at the same point as everyone else at the time, the platform puzzle. Nobody had crossed..then suddenly a spanish video of a group made it...followed by an english speaking group. We had ours within 40 mins or so after seein that video clip!<br />

The guys a game designer for HS, who gives a crap what he says, the hole in the floor has been there all expansion. I doubt anyone will get banned. but people can do it properly if they so wish. You have people selling it for gold doing it that way of though. so that's a lot of people getting &quot;banned&quot; if they do end up going that root. but you have speed runners doing glitches in old raids/dungeons for mount/gear farming, so nothing will happen.</div></div><hr />

I was debating whether to put that in, since it's just a matter of paying gold.<br />
<br />
I guess it is hidden though. In it goes.<br />

Its not close to impossible to get a group together because everyone will be looking for a group when they get to the part that requires a group. Stop being lazy or stop complaining.<br />
<br />
Not an issue currently, but those after it after BfA would be incredibly hard pressed. It's like trying to get them Garrison raid invasion achievements, trivially easy when everyone was doing them every week during WoD, to becoming next to impossible now due to how rare the summon items are on an individual basis.</div></div><hr />

At any time in the groupfinder there is usually a group available that is looking for people to do old achieves. As a matter of fact when I was looking for a group for this mount there were still groups looking to do the kneeling achieve from firelands and the fishing achieves from Legion.<br />
<br />
Yes. There were groups LOOKING.<br />
<br />
You do realize you only need two people to do the kneeling achieve (I think 4 total on 25 man)?<br />
<br />
For all you know, that group will sit up all day and not move. And be up tomorrow. And the next day. And the next day.<br />

And this is WITH cross-realm.<br />

<br />
I only did the Green Monocle, so it took more time to fly to the dungeon then to actually get it. It took about 5 minutes to join a group, then maybe 10 minutes for everyone to get in their right spots. I would say from start to finish, it only took maybe 1.5 hours. We did the jumping puzzle first try without even using voice too. Such a great group!</div></div><hr />

Yes, people have begun selling the mount :P<br />
<br />
You just need a group with one monocle colour each on four people, the fifth doesn't even need one.<br />

Jump on the train now, lots of pugs going on. Just be patient and enjoy the puzzle :)</div></div><hr />

You call them customers. Im usually selling any of the 4 monocles whenever people need one. It doesnt take long to do the monocles but I can see how people might want to skip the vashjir or halls of origination parts.</div></div><hr />

when everyone will be doin it<br />

problem is completing it next week a lot of people will be done and it will be almost impossible to get the group going. <br />
<br />
such a shame blizzard is turning favourit solo activity in game aka mount farming into forced interaction with people you will never meet again and about whom you literaly couldnt give less fucks about<br />
<br />
We did it as a guild group. It is my understanding that, if everyone was willing, you could get the 4 people with the monocle to do the hunt again, from the light narrier step, to get your mount.<br />

the multi-person capability link isnt that you can enter someone mount, is that the mount get a 10% speed buff for each person. <br />
<br />
That mean the mount move 50#% faster if you are with the ppl that you complet the quest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They’re linked. The multi-person capability is what gives the speed buff, which is why they’ve restricted it so that only the people you solved it with can mount with you. In essence it’s just a normal one seater mount for the majority who have pugged this.</div></div><hr />

This mount would be wonderful for multi boxing, even being the most ugly mount ingame, if it could fly and be used by all alts.

&quot;The multi-person capability is a special perk just for your established Hivemind group (the 5 people you last completed it with). If you want to link with different people, you can! Just complete it again with a new group.&quot;<br />
<br />
Great, so now it is just another random jellyfish mount...<br />
<br />
Good old Blizzard. Announce something sweet, but in the end you can expect a nasty surprise! Next up from Blizz: &quot;Don't worry guys, we've heard that you wanted a true multi-passenger mount, so we'd love to announce that starting from tomorrow you'll be able to buy the first ever multi-passenger mount from the Blizz Store for only $39,99, OR get it for FREE by buying a 10-year subscription plan!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Alani was just like that.<br />
<br />
Legion had it.<br />
<br />
People have been selling mountruns since BC for shit like Alar.<br />
<br />
There are also groups doing it for free in the Custom part of group finder.</div></div><hr />

Quickly, Role Players, you guys got Blizz to backtrack on a 10+ year stance against cross-faction talking and issue an &quot;emergency hotfix&quot; less than 48 hours after 8.1 all because some RP addon with less than 1k total downloads got broken. Apparently Activision-Blizzard's thick headed devs will only listen to RP complaints. <br />
<br />
Please, find a reason to give Blizz why this will ruin RP servers! This mount is actually fun :(<br />

You'd be foolish to pay for Hivemind, especially when there's so much demand for it. Get one 1/4 of the monocles and look for/create a group in group finder (if you get the yellow one then you are basically Tank/Healer status in regards to demand for these groups). After you find a group with all the monocles, you can easily get the mount done in less than an hour by following the guide.<br />
<br />
Even for those who get it way after, there's always things like the Achievement discord to get groups going. I still see people forming groups for that firelands achieve in that Discord.</div></div><hr />

Was wondering if that was hidden enough to count, since were are other world objects that reward toys in MoP. But I'll throw it in anyway, they snuck that one in in a later patch IIRC.</div></div><hr />

I thought this was an rpg? Where players actually do things together? :)</div></div><hr />

One thing doesnt exclude the other.<br />

An rpg also allows you to experience the game the way you want to, doesnt it?</div></div><hr />

Ok.<br />
<br />
i dont get the point of your post. There is group content and there is solo content... raids are group content only. Scenarios are solo content, just like the mage tower in legion. The majority of the content can be done both ways. So lets not tell others how to enjoy playing the game, as long as they dont spoil other people's experiences?</div></div><hr />

Nobody is telling you.<br />
<br />
Just that if you want this mount get grouping. Otherwise tough.<br />
<br />
There are 400+ other mounts to choose from. And as you said the content can be done both ways. This one chooses the grouping up way for it. Deal with it and do it or don't get the mount.</div></div><hr />

I dont understand why you are telling me deal with it or dont get the mount. ???? Did i wrote anything to cancel group quests???<br />
<br />
I first wrote about the restrictions on the multi seat mount, and that was it. People should first read what people say before criticizing them.<br />
<br />
And i know there are +400 mounts out there... i have at least the 300 mount achiev.</div></div><hr />

Ah shit. Then I do apologise mate. Honest mistake. :)<br />

Grats on the 250 as well, as it is hard.<br />

I got to 300 with the help of the class hall mounts. I think they all count. When i was buying the last mounts of the 12th class i got that achiev.</div></div><hr />

Your mistake is targeting my unique comment and disregarding the general opinion on this mount, which i posted against.<br />
Some are complaining this mount requires several people in order to obtain it, while the same people complain that this is an rpg where people are supposed to play together, that's why they're begging for vanilla wow.<br />
Just the troubled audience that can never be content with anything.</div></div><hr />

look, i really don't want to keep this discussion going, because honestly i think we both have more interesting things to do here on the forums and in real life as well. So I will try to reply swiftly. when you say:<br />

Blizzard finally(in BfA) creates something awesome like this, and still people complain.<br />
<br />
You will be able to get it later on. Of course not by just running into people doing this in-game, but if you join the Secret Finding discord you can easily find people to do this with. There will be several people in that discord willing to help you out even if they already have done it. I'm one of them.<br />
And you don't have to use voice communication yourself - especially if you're not the one leading the group. In my group we had 2 people leading, 1 guy talking a bit and the other 2 never saying anything or just using the in-game chat.</div></div><hr />
