Legion - Nightfallen and Withered<br />
We previously looked at (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5327-Artifact-Trait-Calculator-Fishing-Artifact-Nightborne-Gnome-Hunters-Tweets) the Nightborne (http://wow.gamepedia.com/Nightborne). Today we are looking at the Nightfallen and Withered. When the Nightborne are exiled, they are cut off from the Nightwell. This transforms them into the Nightfallen and eventually Withered. <br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Developer Communication<br />
Question for you awesome people: Game devs get accused a lot of arrogance. How do you know when a dev is being authentically humble? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/667101654731259904))<br />
Can't think of any 'humble' devs, but humble can be very close to 'pushover'. But if you need the opposite go find @Holinka.<br />
Also, if someone thinks I'm arrogant because I troll people who insult me personally, I'm fine with that. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/667496340604096512))<br />
I think the community wants more admittance to poor design<br />
One challenge there is once you admit a mistake, there can be an expectation that it will be fixed very quickly. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/667499497681891328))<br />
<br />
Interviews Watcher with are so good because he doesn't do this. He admits mistakes and seems to know what players think.<br />
Do you think players often claim &quot;arrogant&quot; when what they mean is &quot;I disagree with your direction?&quot; (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/667145459559895040))<br />
Yes. He is very good at not spinning things. You can trust what he says. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/667145668608176128))<br />
<br />
My view of you changed over time aswell. Often you were seen by the community as the decider &amp; bringer of bad news/nerfs <br />
I'm not a fan of the &quot;spokesperson&quot; policy. The more devs who communicate, the more real the whole org appears to be. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/667467047152955392))<br />
<br />
You gave me a headache! Btw, why the focus on humble? Why not something else (empathetic, informative, ...)?<br />
I don't get accused that much of lacking empathy or not sharing information. Arrogant comes up a lot so I wanted to dive into it. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/667488409691123712))<br />
<br />
Arrogance is easier to achieve with 140 characters.<br />
.That is true! I know I come across as flippant on Twitter because I lack characters for nuance. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/667494496377004033))<br />
<br />
If you could guarantee &quot;flawless&quot; CM feedback, would you still communicate with players? And why?<br />
Great question. I think so, just because I personally enjoy it. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/667727075122409472))<br />
Also, no disrespect to CMs, but players probably also enjoy being able to reach devs directly. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/667727256282787840))<br />
<br />
What if there was a better way to structure the community? Some people are much better at feedback and others dilute them<br />
I've considered some kind of &quot;anyone can view but invite only to post.&quot; Would that feel too velvet ropey? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/667868516595269633))<br />
<br />
Reputation / Questing<br />
What's your take on WoW starting zones ? For example, what would you change if you could ?<br />
We redid Elwynn a couple of times while I was there. Emphasis was on showing a good time and telling the story, not teaching. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/666428377239191552))<br />
I do think you end up killing tiny wildlife for a bit too long in most zones. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/666428466036764672))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
success breeds arrogance. It's human nature.<br />
It's funny because I see the opposite where I work. Success just creates greater pressure to live up to those expectations. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/667145296435003392))<br />

<br />
Exactly, the Fury Weapons are bullshit, complete utter bullshit, but I actually like one of the Arms Artifacts, the one with the skull, so I wonder if I can change my Fury Artifacts into Arms? But probably not.</div></div><hr />

I think they said something about size of weapons being off or something, but based on these images, and the hilts, many of the mage swords look like 2h, and none of the fury do.</div></div><hr />

Yep, here's the source: World of Warcraft Q&amp;A (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5259-World-of-Warcraft-Q-A)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mormegil</div><div class="date">2015-11-28, 08:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's pretty obvious now that those fury artifacts were designed as 1h weapons and then they've listened to the overwhelming backlash and changed their design plans for fury to TG.<br />
<br />
if they are going to scale up these weapons so that they are 2h I sincerely hope they don't just straight increase the scale, it'll look like we're carrying around a couple of planks. A simple length increase would look better IMHO.</div></div><hr />

Ion tries, and his personality is one that inspires trust. He's not the most dynamic guy on the stage, but he flings the least BS - and, it's his job to speak for a team, so he may have to communicate ideas he doesn't necessarily agree with. He took the heat for the flying debacle, and stood up pretty well to it. Others might not have. <br />
<br />
And, IMHO, no matter who tries to blow him up, Holinka is just a dick. Maybe if he spent less time trolling people and working on his content, we wouldnt have failures like Ashran. And, if they stop him from speaking publicly, Lore will have an easier job, because it seems like half of his job is telling everyone what Holinka REALLY means whenever he posts something, or speaks on a panel.</div></div><hr />

I care and many others do too as we've seen. Why are you so offended? Just don't read it if it bothers you. It's not like there's much else to post about the majority of the time so it's nice to see.</div></div><hr />

We have to choose between posting giant posts where everyone will not read most of the post and then having gaps in content or posting more reasonable length posts consistently, especially with less important news. The setting changes are interesting but would have been overlooked in the initial post that was already very long. We constantly see people mentioning they didn't know something that we have posted in the news as it is, so giant posts would make the problem worse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you serious? If anything, LoL is an &quot;MO&quot;. The &quot;massive&quot; stands for a big open online world where the player avatars can randomly meet each other. So no, LoL is not an MMO.<br />
<br />
The warrior weapons really look awful. It's all got that vrykul vibe. With the class hall being also vrykul themed I have the feeling that blizz wants to sell vrykul as the &quot;ultimate warriors&quot; with all that dragon shit and stuff on the weapons. Just awful, I am not some puny human warrior. But okay, transmog it is then. They just totally messed up the fantasy with those. Arms is kinda okay but most of the variations just suck.<br />
The warrior &quot;CI&quot; should be like &quot;no shiny floating things, no laser beams inside of weapons, no animal or dragon themes, no holy, golden glowing shit&quot; the theme of the warrior is that we don't need any god or magic, just the power that is inside ourselves.<br />

<br />
Hello? Well of Eternity?<br />
If memory doens't fail me, elves were cut out of the Well when it imploded and Illidan used a vial of it to create a new one at Mount Hyjal, where Nordrassil grew up.<br />
Highborne left behind created the Nightwell.<br />
Highborne exiled from Hyjal split in 2: the ones that went overseas and created the Sunwell (high elves) and the ones that went south and resort to demonic power (Shen'Dralar).<br />
<br />
So, ALL elves are arcane junkies. Just Night Elves did a better work hiding it behind the &quot;it's a Titan gift, we're better that any of you&quot; excuse.<br />
<br />
Also, the Night Elf Moonwells scattered around the world. If I remember correctly, Night Elves granted access to them to the High Elves that didn't follow Kael'thas.</div></div><hr />

&quot;lol&quot; no it isn't.<br />
<br />
It's an online multiplayer Action-RTS. Action implying you take active control of the unit, rather than many. Similar to how an Action-RPG consists of active control of one character, rather than the passive control of many.<br />

<br />
Most of what he says and he states this from time to time himself that that when discussing and/or answering questions about WoW, he tries to apply them to both LoL and WoW in general terms. There are still a lot of people that enjoy his insight from being both in and out of Blizzard and now being with Riot. <br />
<br />
No one person is forced to read what MMO-C post from him, but just the same I do enjoy reading what he has to say after all this time.</div></div><hr />

I will stay with my T6 transmog and BT weapon/shield for my tank. Vrykul are not warriors, they are berserkers. This would fit fury, but not the other two specs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The big Alpha datamine did suggest a complete lack of skills like Mark of the Wild, Blessing of Might etc. Those buffs were never that &quot;fun&quot; or &quot;interesting&quot;. Solo, it was nice to have for the buff it provided. Groups/Raids, it became a &quot;must have&quot; to complete the encounter. Rather have more abilities that give you short term buffs, on a relatively short cooldown.</div></div><hr />

Ok after looking at them more I have to agree at least 3/4 of the warrior artifacts look like shit; alright all the fury ones look like shit and most of the arms ones.</div></div><hr />
