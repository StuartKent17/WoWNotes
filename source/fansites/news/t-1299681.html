Blizzard Insider #48 - Interview with Tom Chilton on Patch 5.3: Escalation<br />
In Patch 5.3: Escalation, players fight back against the aggressive reign of Garrosh Hellscream, once proud War Chief of the Horde. His crimes are many and his allies are dwindling, but he still holds the Horde capital city of Orgrimmar and retains full command of a vast army of loyal Kor’kron elite soldiers, fed by reinforced supply lines running throughout the Barrens. <br />
<br />
Toppling the tyrant will not be easy.<br />
<br />
To prepare you for this monumental struggle, the Blizzard Insider discussed the content in Escalation with Game Director Tom Chilton.<br />
<br />
Blizzard Insider: Before we dive into the details of Patch 5.3, can you tell us about how the previous patch, 5.2: Rise of the Thunder King, has gone?<br />
<br />
Tom Chilton: Overall we’re very happy with how the Thunder King raid turned out. I think it ranks among our best ever as far as size, scope, and overall quality of raid mechanics goes. Lei Shen in particular stood out as a great final encounter for the raid, on par with Yogg-Saron or Ragnaros. One of the more experimental aspects of the Thunder King patch that we’re especially happy with is the Determination buff, which gives all Raid Finder group members a 5% boost whenever they wipe. Raid Finder groups tend to have players of all skill levels, so this change has really helped these groups hold together and learn the mechanics of more difficult encounters, which overall has made Raid Finder groups a more viable option for progression.<br />

<br />
Blizzard Insider: How does Escalation fit into the larger story arc for Mists of Pandaria®?<br />
<br />
Tom Chilton: Patch 5.3 tells the story of what’s been happening on the Kalimdor home front while the continent of Pandaria was being explored across the South Seas. As the name implies, the core conflict revolves around Garrosh Hellscream and his escalating war efforts. Of course, the Alliance opposes Garrosh—for obvious reasons—but now even large factions of the Horde have turned on Garrosh as well. They’ve grown tired of his constant warmongering, and so Vol’jin leads the Darkspear trolls in open rebellion against their former war chief. Garrosh seems to be universally despised, so now players on both sides of the Horde and Alliance will soon get a chance to take a swing at him.<br />

<br />
Blizzard Insider: Can you talk about the new features being added with Escalation? What features are you most looking forward to seeing players dig into?<br />
<br />
Tom Chilton: The new Scenarios constitute the backbone of the Escalation patch, and we think players are going to have a lot of fun with these. Another big change will be the new events in the Barrens (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3189-Noblegarden-Begins-Tomorrow-Giveaway-Patch-5-3-World-Changes-Blue-Posts-TCG-Art). The main supply lines that feed Garrosh’s war machine in Orgrimmar run throughout the Barrens, so players must win victories there first before they’ll be able to take on Garrosh directly. From the design side, we want to use the Barrens events to experiment with end-game open world content in new ways and try to get away from some of the more repetitive aspects of daily questing. As a result, we shaped the events as a series of dynamic events, rather than a straightforward progression of daily quests. We hope this ends up feeling much more fluid and freeform than previous end-game quests, with players of both the Alliance and Horde rampaging around, raiding Garrosh’s supply lines and spoiling his war efforts. Plus, just having the Horde and Alliance together in the Barrens at the same time will open up a lot of opportunities for world PVP.<br />

<br />
Blizzard Insider:Can you talk a little about the changes to PvP combat? In what ways do the mechanics of PvP evolve in Escalation?<br />
<br />
Tom Chilton: One of the biggest evolutions in PvP stems from the changes to the Resilience system. Mechanically speaking, Resilience stays much the same as before, but most of it has been removed from gear, and instead players are getting a much higher innate level of Resilience. Gear still matters in PvP, and certain gems and enchants will retain bonuses to Resilience, but the overall survivability difference between players with different sets of gear is narrower after patch 5.3. This means player skill plays a larger role in determining the outcome of a PvP battle than before. Plus, the Resilience change has the secondary benefit of allowing PvE players to cross over more easily into PvP, since they won’t have to first collect a separate set of Resilience gear in order to survive.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/may/thumb/bi4804.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/may/bi4804.jpg) <br />
<br />
Blizzard Insider: How about new PvP content?<br />
<br />
Tom Chilton: On the PvP content side, we’re also adding a new Battleground and a new Arena with Patch 5.3. The Battleground is called Deepwind Gorge (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3229-Patch-5-3-Deepwind-Gorge-Battleground-PvP-Power-Change-Blue-Tweets-TCG-Art) and it features a “gold grab” mechanic, where both factions race to collect a certain threshold of gold for their side. Players can get gold in two ways, either gradually over time by holding key strategic points around the mining operations, or they can steal a gold cart from the other team’s base and drag it back to their own base. So Deepwind Gorge essentially combines classic “king of the hill” with “capture the flag” PvP mechanics. <br />
<br />
The new Arena is called the Tigers’ Peak (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3245-Tiger-s-Peak-Arena-May-10-Hotfixes-Valor-Points-and-Rewards-BoP-Reagents-TCG-Art), and it experiments with the concept of “high ground” in an interesting new way. The Arena geometry includes several raised pillars, the tops of which are ringed with fences. These fences do not block line of site or ranged attacks, but they will catch any player who gets knocked back into them, thus enabling ranged players to hold the high ground and snipe or land heals from on high a bit more easily than they could otherwise with normal un-railed pillars.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Blizzard Insider: Can you go into details on the new Scenarios in Patch 5.3? Has the design philosophy of Scenarios changed much since they were first introduced at the beginning of Mists of Pandaria?<br />
<br />
Tom Chilton: One thing we thought that Scenarios lacked after the launch of Mists of Pandaria was a sense of possible failure. Don’t get me wrong, they were always meant to be quick, fun, bite-sized pieces of content, but I think we can offer more of a challenge to players who are ready for it. So we’re introducing Heroic versions (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3211-Heroic-Scenarios-CM-Quest-Reward-Titan-s-Grip-and-Polearms-Blue-Posts-Hearthstone) of several existing Scenarios, plus all the new Scenarios coming with Patch 5.3. <br />
<br />
Unlike most normal Scenarios, the Heroic versions will only be available if you’re already in a premade group with two other players. Since the difficulty will be ramped up, we wanted to be able to tune the Heroic Scenarios around a group of players who know each other and are used to playing together. Plus, since it’s easier to build a group when you only need two other players, rather than the usual five, we figured Scenarios are a good place to experiment with requiring premade groups again.<br />
<br />

<br />
Blizzard Insider: Let's talk loot. What kinds of items can players expect to find?<br />
<br />
Tom Chilton: Players can definitely expect the usual Item Level upgrades. In addition, we’re also tweaking the loot system so players have option to choose which spec they wish to receive gear for (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3196-Battleground-Roles-Loot-Spec-Menu-LFR-Difficulty-Blue-Tweets-HS-Interview-Comic) . This means, for example, you can collect gear for your tank spec while you’re DPS-ing, or vice versa, which makes it easier to collect different sets of gear for your off-spec. In addition, on the art side, we’re also reintroducing the old world Dungeon Tier 2 armor sets (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3214-Darkspear-Rebellion-Items-April-16-Hotfixes-RNG-and-Loot-System-Blue-Tweets-Comic) back into the game as rewards for the revamped Barrens content. This enables new players to collect some of the older gear sets for Transmogrification without having to go back and farm the old world dungeons<br />
<br />
[b]Blizzard Insider: Anything else you’d like to share before you go?<br />
<br />
Tom Chilton: Yeah, one more thing—another cool feature we’re adding with 5.3 is the ability to see other players’ Pet Battles (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3239-Patch-5-3-Pet-Battle-Spectating-Blue-Tweets-Riot-Toxic-Player-Behavior-Fan-Art), so you can conduct Pet Battles with an audience now. Other than that, we just wanted to say thanks again to our all of our play testers who’ve played through the 5.3 content on the Public Test Realm—your time and contributions are always much appreciated.<br />

PvE Gear in PvP<br />
This one is a bit of an eyeful, so be prepared for a long post. I recommend reading the whole thing, but there is a TL;DR at the end. If my memory serves me well, this will be my biggest post since joining the community team!<br />
<br />
Mírion has hit the nail on the head in pretty much all of his posts in this thread so far. Rated PvP has been seeing a decline in participants over time; however this is not because of balance issues as most people assume it to be. It is mostly due to the increased separation and distinction between PvP and PvE gear. As has been said, getting a full set of PvP gear is not really that hard in the sense of difficulty, but it is when you consider the grind and the feeling you get in those first few steps of PvP without the right gear. <br />
<br />
I am sure that most, if not all of you here have at least once had the experience of entering into PvP either late in an expansion or season. If you have, then you know how difficult the process of getting your honor set and first few conquest pieces is. You start off by getting hit by trucks and attacking back with the damage of a wet noodle, as your gear gets better though, the experience improves and you start having fun. But you have to remember that it's those first few steps which are the most crucial to people continuing their PvP experience.<br />
<br />
This separation of gear has caused a decrease over time in the number of PvP participants because the first few steps into PvP are so daunting for those who try it that the turnover results in a drop rather than an increase. For PvP, because so many people get scared away from it when they first have a go, you have much less &quot;fresh blood&quot;, so to say. This ends up resulting in there not being enough new players sticking with PvP to compensate for those that decide to move onto something that is better suited to them.<br />
<br />
Let's take two examples of people who are taking their first steps in PvP right now and making their decision if this is something they want to keep doing: <br />
<br />
<br />
Player A is an established raider. They’re geared out in some pretty sweet ToT items, but wants to try out something new.<br />
Players B is a freshly dinged level 90. They’re keen-eyed to try out PvP and has their crafted PvP set.<br />
And to have them here to be used in the two below examples, Tyrannical, the BiS PvP geared player having a bit of fun in battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now the below scenarios are extreme cases, you will not always be coming across a BiS person in PvP, and there are ways in which to increase your enjoyment when starting out such as playing with friends. While a lot of players will push through this initial hurdle and start to enjoy their time in PvP, I just want to give you some examples of what a first time experience can be. <br />
<br />
Epic storytelling time #1:<br />
Player A:<br />
A enters an Arathi Basin match, bright-eyed and keen to try out this aspect of the game that's entirely new to them. The gates open for A and they charge off to Lumber Mill and engage their new-found foes. They are having a jolly time doing some decent damage and even scoring a kill while no one is attacks them, however then Tyrannical on the opposing side decides to attack A and he dies in an instant. A wonders what happened, but ignores the occurrence the first time.<br />
<br />
A resurrects at base and heads out into the battle, but the same thing keeps happening — A goes into battle, gets attacked and dies. They get tired of this happening repeatedly and decide that PvP is not quite their cup of tea.<br />
<br />
Epic storytelling time #2:<br />
Player B:<br />
B just got their Crafted Dreadful Gladiator's gear and an okay BoE weapon from the Auction House. They queue up for a battleground and get thrown into Twin Peaks, ready for battle they run out of the gates bearing down on the opponents flag, eager to capture it and bring glory to their team. <br />
<br />
Another person manages to grab the flag before B can reach it, but that's okay — B now wants to go take down the enemy flag carrier. Little to B's knowledge, Tyrannical has the flag and is running along to bring it to their base. B intercepts Tyrannical and starts attacking as hard as he can but is doing little to take away from Tyrannical’s health. Tyrannical decides that the damage B is doing, while minimal, is becoming a nuisance, B is attacked and dies in moments. Like A, B ignores this first occurrence and decides to head back in to battle. But after this situation is repeated they become frustrated by doing so little damage and dying so quickly. They give up on PvP and move on to another aspect of the game where they feel they can make a more meaningful contribution.<br />
<br />
As you can see, both players entered into PvP, bright-eyed and looking to have some fun, but they were met with a brick wall as they began their journey. Because of this brick wall that they encountered though, their motivation waned until they gave up and eventually decided to move to something else. The changes that we have planned for patch 5.3 are designed to improve the first time PvP’ers experience to try and increase the retention rate of newcomers to the scene. <br />
<br />
The change will also ensure that PvP gear remains the best possible choice for PvP, do not fret over this. What we is to improve the experience for those starting out in PvP and as such increase the pool of players and the size of the community; which in-turn makes the experience of current PvP’ers playing the game that much better too.<br />
<br />
TL;DR — The changes help increase the size of the PvP community and makes PvP more welcoming to new players, without making PvE gear BiS.<br />
<br />
Making PvE gear BiS something I'm a bit scared off, since you nerfed the PvP gems it just seems like the pure stat gems will be better. Hope you're keeping an eye on them. <br />
However any additional gem sockets come at the cost of the Ilvl budget, lowering some other stats. Base stats will be near, if not exactly identical when scaling comes into account. The reason that PvP gear will be stronger is because of the PvP power stat that is not taken into account for the Ilvl budget on items.<br />
<br />
In the blog you posted it said that you removed resilience on &quot;most&quot; pvp pieces, are they still on trinkets? <br />
At this time Medallions still have Resilience on them, Insignias, Badges and Emblems do not have resilience. This can possibly change in the future, but right now we will be keeping an eye on trinkets to ensure that they do not become a problem.<br />
<br />
what about player C ?<br />
I was giving some examples of situations where players take their first few steps into PvP. The examples I gave were enough to display the point behind the post, any more would have just made it far too big for anyone to read.<br />
<br />
anyway... without these double proc, how do you kill a healer? <br />
Coordinating burst and having good CC timings and effective target swaps. I take it from your posts that you are referring to difficulties killing a healer solo, first off — bad idea; it's do-able, but I would definitely recommend going at them with a friend. Healers are built around the concept of being able to, if played well, keep a team of three players alive against another team of three players, generally 2 DPS and a healer. If a healer was designed to be taken down by a single player in a 1v1 situation, then what kind of hope would they have in keeping a group alive in arenas or battlegrounds?<br />
<br />
Healers can be killed and are far from being immortal, you just need to apply the appropriate pressure and play your cards right. <br />
<br />
begin with ... these trinket should not even exist, or certainly should not be allowed to use them in pvp.<br />
<br />
these trinkets currently have a unique function spoil the game. <br />
Those trinkets offer a different playstyle and have received multiple changes to adapt them for PvP. Not only this, but those trinkets will also be susceptible to the same effects of the Ilvl cap as every other piece of gear in patch 5.3.<br />
<br />
There is a PLAYER C which you didn't consider in your example. Player C enters a Battleground to get trashed like player A and player B but does not quit.<br />
<br />
While a lot of players will push through this initial hurdle and start to enjoy their time in PvP, I just want to give you some examples of what a first time experience can be. <br />
But I do understand where you are going with your post. But if the situation you give is accurate, then once that player reaches full BiS PvP gear, they will just stop until a new season comes around. A better way to entice people like this to play and continue to play is not to just offer them a way to enhance their characters power which is quite limited in how far it can go, but rather to also provide other rewards like those planned for patch 5.3. Some of the rewards we have planned are for when players reach 2500 rating, they can get a special tabard and a cloak. We also are thinking of potentially adding in rewards for accomplishments such as X number of RBG's or Arenas won. <br />
<br />
Also, I am not sure where the progression of gear is being halved. The gear progression is no different from what it has been in previous seasons (Elite weapons being the exception), outside of the start of Season 13 where Elite gear was better than the normal one. In all previous seasons the progression was as follows:<br />
<br />
Crafted PvP gear Honor Gear Conquest Gear Elite weapon (Only one that was an upgrade)/cosmetic elite upgrades<br />
<br />
Now the progress of gear will be as follows:<br />
<br />
Crafted PvP gear Honor Gear Conquest Gear Cosmetic upgrades<br />
<br />
So in the end, the progression of gear has not really changed apart from the Elite weapon just becoming a cosmetic improvement. All this change is doing is leveling out the playing field a bit more to make entry into PvP a lot less daunting to help welcoming more people into the PvP community — this helps the entirety of the PvP community, even the player C you mentioned as they now have more people to play against.<br />
<br />
You don't get ilvl 440 gear and go to take on Ra-Den.... that is why there is other raids and LFR to gear up and &quot;progress&quot; to finally take down Ra-Den one day. The point is to grind and get the gear to be able to do so.<br />
<br />
Same with PvP. You don't just slap on gear and expect to take down a fully geared PvP player, that is just silly and should not be accomplished by someone with PvE gear. <br />
PvE however has dungeons, heroics, LFR and then raiding in order to ease you into the process, so you are able to participate in gear appropriate content until you are able to enter raids. When a PvP player starts off their journey, they have no equivalent of dungeons where the health and damage of their opponent isn't insurmountable. They are thrown straight into a raid, where they have to overcome a raid boss with the gear you would normally use in a normal dungeon.<br />
<br />
Why not make BG with a ilvl cap and pitch players with a certain amount of PvP ilvl against each other and those with better gear against their counterparts. <br />
That's kind of what this change does, without diminishing the overall pool of players. It also accomplishes multiple other tasks as well, such as helping prevent PvE gear in PvP. <br />
<br />
I was refering to the gear grind through the upgrade system in patch 5.1 <br />
This system got a lot of disapproval from the PvP community, from the feedback we received it was deemed best for it not to return in patch 5.2 or 5.3, which I am sure a lot of people here are glad to hear.<br />
<br />
and, as you said, the expected elite gear in patch 5.2 which was abandoned during the first few weeks in favor of the 5.3 system. <br />
This was removed because the gear inflation that would have occurred with season 14 would have been immense. Also, the difference between someone starting out in PvP and someone in full elite would have been too big. The new system for 5.3 was developed and deemed more appropriate and better for the community as a whole.

Patch 5.3 Release Date<br />
Do you know if 5.3 is coming out this month or not for sure. I heard that is what you guys are aiming for but not sure if its a possibility it might not happen. <br />
At current, it won't be much longer. We're hoping to get it out soon (and not the usual soon). I can't confirm more than that for you right now. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/260849-where-is-nethaera/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8728854060?page=2#35))<br />

Death Knight Changes and CC in PvP<br />
I'm glad they're reverting the nerfs and buffing necrotic strike, I was getting worried. <br />
That's not the case anymore, the developers implemented a different change so that Death Knight diseases will no longer gain benefit from Tricks of the trade: <br />
<br />
Change reverted: Festering Strike reverted to deal 200% weapon damage. Change reverted: Scourge Strike reverted to deal 135% weapon damage. Change reverted: Unholy Might reverted to 15% Strength increase. Frost Fever and Blood Plague: The damage from these two diseases can no longer benefit from the damage increase granted by Tricks of the Trade.<br />
<br />
How can one class just flop over the second he makes one tiny mistake, while the other can survive 3 people dpsing him while his healer:<br />
<br />
- Runs of to get out of combat and ress<br />
- Sits in multiple full CCs <br />
Speaking of CCs and (burst) damage, which is something that gets mentioned from time to time:<br />
<br />
The developers are keeping an eye on both burst and CC. Not being able to play your character for some time isn't fun, and neither is being bursted from 100% to 0.<br />
<br />
Crowd Control is an integral part of World of Warcraft PvP. Without it, it would be little more than tunneling down your opponent. CC introduces the opportunities for skill and timing to come to shine in a way that wouldn't be possible in its absence. <br />
<br />
What helps developers the most are specific examples. They do see the YouTube videos that the community shares from time to time, and all too often, they're taken against an undergeared opponent, or a player has every conceivable RNG going for them when they post a highlight. <br />
<br />
Nonetheless, they're looking at simplifying CC and diminishing returns in the future, and they already recognize that some abilities and combinations of abilities can lend themselves to burst that's higher than what they'd like, such as Incanter's Ward (which was recently modified on the PTR to Incanter's Ward now allows the Mage to gain up to a maximum of 15% increase to spell damage, down from 30%, but the effect now lasts 25 seconds, up from 15 seconds.). That's the kind of ability that they'd likely 'smooth out' a bit, as they did in this case, where its effects get spread out in such a way as to not damage PvE dps, while lessening its burst potential in PvP.

Please please remember they are now releasing mini patches between major patches.<br />
<br />
I knew this QQ would happen.<br />
<br />
Blizzard &quot;OK we are going to release a major Raid Patch every 6 months and a smaller patch in between.&quot;<br />
<br />
Community - Great that will give us some filler content to do between raid patches.<br />
<br />
... Time passes ....<br />
<br />
Community - OMFG why is the smaller patch not a major patch.<br />
<br />
Would you rather they just release major patches every 6 months?<br />
<br />
I am much much happier with the current model.<br />
<br />
With the exception of 5 mans (which they have admitted they wish they had done now) the amount of content and the speed we are getting it is much higher than ever before.<br />
<br />
Do I wish they had done a couple of 5 mans sure, I 100% agree as long as they did not rain epics like the 4.3 5 mans did.<br />
<br />
By the time 5.4 gets released we will have had 3 unique massive raid tiers within a year with 13(ish) wings of LFR (with the expansion hopefully lasting 18 months).<br />
<br />
Me personally I would take 13 wings of LFR &gt; 3 5 mans as to me it gives more variety for my alts and for earning valor, but I 100% understand that some people would prefer more 5 mans.<br />

From the design side, we want to use the Barrens events to experiment with end-game open world content in new ways and try to get away from some of the more repetitive aspects of daily questing. As a result, we shaped the events as a series of dynamic events, rather than a straightforward progression of daily quests.<br />
Has anyone done the barrens open world events, and how do they play out? Sounds quite interesting!</div></div><hr />

We hope this ends up feeling much more fluid and freeform than previous end-game quests, with players of both the Alliance and Horde rampaging around, raiding Garrosh’s supply lines and spoiling his war efforts. Plus, just having the Horde and Alliance together in the Barrens at the same time will open up a lot of opportunities for world PVP.<br />
<br />
This is most excellent. <br />
<br />
Finally we are doing more stuff in the world - apart from dailies - instead of instances.<br />

Oh man!<br />
<br />
First of all: Have you completed ToT? Are you geared? And second: You expect a full blown 12 boss raid every 3 months or what? Despite the fact that at the end of the day a tiny fraction does HM, a small fraction does normals and still less than 50% do LFR? Are you so egoistic that you want to deprive all the pvpers and NON-raiders of content?</div></div><hr />

I still think they are clueless and the resoning behind the PvP changes is way of base.<br />
<br />
I dinged 90 and worked my way to a full honor set with 0 crafted items. Especially in random BG where most people are headless chickens you can easily be usefull in fulll blue questing gear. Imagine the outrage in PvE if armor sets making you ready for the latest tier of raiding was given freely to fresh 90´s??<br />
<br />
IMO the problems in PvP are:<br />
<br />
- It´s all become a CC/burst timing game, with blanket CC/silence being way out of control<br />
- Infinite mana pools. Even OOM´ing a healer is no longer an option<br />
- Instant casting.. Hard to silence/interupt when 90% of spells are either instant casts or uninteruptable<br />
- BALANCE.. Yes this a major issue. Some classes are extremely OP thus making some arena combos godlike<br />
- Imbalance of selfhealing on non healer/hybrid classes. Rogues can vanish and recoup indefinently, warriors second wind, warlocks are almost tanky etc, while a class like DK has almost 0 selfhealing.<br />
<br />
A few personal gripes<br />
<br />
- Choosing the skills that are and are not allowed in Arena. Like Warlock tele portal on multiple level arenas.<br />
- Severe skill/ability/spell bloat. You need a razer Naga 9000000 and 200 macros and 400 keybinds to play properly.</div></div><hr />

To be honest pvp needs to be scaling everyone to the same item level. It can still reward awesome gear that would be decent in the open world, and look awesome. They also need to create pvp and pve versions for the majority of spells in the game. That would balance pvp, and i dont see a problem with it. People wanting to one shot noobs wouldnt like the changes, but they need to quit the game anyways.</div></div><hr />

Isn't the problem with WOW in its entirety? The gear from freshly minted level 90 to current expansion standards, PvE or PvP, is beyond reason. Monty Hall is a great way to describe WOW's loot, they do all this work in the name of balance and then the loot guys come along and it all goes to hell. They need either to jack the crafted gear up as the expansion draws on or allow the early sets to be dirt cheap so people can move into them as fast as possible</div></div><hr />

ICC for 13 months.<br />

Yeah WotLK was super amazing!<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong Ulduar and ICC where high quality raids.<br />
<br />
ICC lasted 13 months though.<br />
<br />
In MoP we are getting 3 very high quality raids to last 18 months (only 5 months longer than the entirety of ICC).<br />
<br />
In WotLK we had 2 very high quality raids in 25 months.</div></div><hr />

Yes, you are correct. They are just now realizing how bad it was to let it go on. This expansion is the first where it's a serial gap between a fresh 90 and a fully geared 90 (in PVE or PVP gear). And this will only worsen in upcoming expansions. The problem is so big, that the only way to really fix it, is to just get rid of gear entirely and actually balance the game, which they can't seem to do for the life of them. Even if they did the great item crush, it would only bring along new problems while solving others. The changes they are making now are not really addressing the issue, they are in-fact, avoiding the real issue, and just pushing it under the rug and hoping nobody will notice.</div></div><hr />

The equivilent would be a PvP player jumping into LFR. Which they do a lot of the time, and do just fine.<br />
<br />
So what are you whining about? Its not like they made it so you can jump right into Arena with blues or PvE gear and dominate is it? And PvP gear will still be superior to PvE due to how PvP Power works.<br />
<br />
I think the only people who are complaining are those who don't really understand what's going on.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry to burst your bubble but GW2 did not invent those &quot;dynamic world events&quot;, they did copy them from another game...<br />
<br />
(plus, the events are only &quot;dynamic&quot; or &quot;fun&quot; for the first... 10 levels or so and then they just get repetitive and bland)<br />

That would happen if he doesn't grasp the concept of hit/exp cap. Other than that, while he would perform lower than his pve friends, he would still perform decently. Not to mention, &quot;cheating&quot; LFR ilvl check and etc.<br />
<br />
Now on the other side... a pve geared player in pvp... well... 0 pvp power... only base resilience... hehehehe<br />
<br />
That happened back in TBC when they introduced arenas and arena season gear/resilience. Ppl would farm the pvp gear to go to raids. Most of the time pvp gear, like weapons and gloves, were BiS (or the last step before BiS) for pve. Wich was stupid.<br />
<br />
The fact that pvp resil/power won't impact item budget should warn anyone of that happening again.<br />
<br />
Back in MoP beta when they came with the pvp resil/power idea. Lots of players warned (myself included) them that it would create 2 problems:<br />
<br />
1) PvP gear with free pvp stats (no item budget cost) would make pvp gear good for pve like it was in TBC;<br />
2) PvP power and Base Resil + Gear Resil would creat a huge gap right on the second MoP pvp season and at the end of the expansion would be stupid. And on top of that, would make the 1) reason even stronger (because of the increased ilvl with free pvp stats with no impact on pve stats), while the same would not happen for pve gear in pvp.<br />
<br />
Blizzard just ignored and kept going with their idea &quot;if it pvp def/atk worked in swtor and others, it will work in WoW, but let's just make a few changes so they won't say we copied it&quot;... their changes just screwed the idea they took from said games.<br />
<br />
Ok, they kept pvp gear in a lower ilvl than their supposed pve equivalent, but only that and heroic gear had no pvp equivalent, not that it would matter for pvp anyways since pvp power/pvp resil owns hard in pvp (but in a pve setting a pve player would need heroic gear to have the same &quot;own hard&quot; feeling against his fellow pvp geared friend in that raid thanks to the free pvp stat...) and that was only what they did to &quot;fix all the problems&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I am bad at trying to be sarcastic in my posts when I want to be. lol :) Not sure the true originator of the MMO as far as I know it was Everquest and if so then all MMO's since have in some form gotten their idea's from EQ.<br />

I'm not sure what did you raid on TBC but no pvp gear was any better than any pve gear because pvp gear was using a stat slot, so you always lose 1 stat while using pvp. My guild didn't accept players using pvp gear because it was a waste on raiding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
people do need to be told how to gear and use talents. People aren't born with this knowledge you know! Everyone had to learn it at some point. Just because it's not new to some people doesn't mean it's not new to others. If they are willing to learn then they do fit into the game. They won't learn everything overnight. Want to keep this game alive then encourage and help new players instead of berating them for needing help.</div></div><hr />

And when you see toxic comments like this from the diehard fanboys, one can understand the slow decline of people wanting to play MMO's when they are treated like crap from others. The sad state of the MMO community in general.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I'd be real happy if a lot of people did leave the mmo genre. The games were much better when they weren't mainstream, imo. Maybe it won't be good for huge businesses but the quality of the community would surely go up.</div></div><hr />

lol... i love these kinda people. You think GW2 was the first game ever created? What they are copying has been in games since UO.. and certainly Rift would be a bigger comparison than GW2.

As long as they are bad players, I would be fine with that but trying to recruit is already hard enough without more actual real non-nerf raiders leaving. The toxic environment is the entitlement crowd thinking because they log in, they should get just as much as everyone else.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrile</div><div class="date">2013-05-17, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From the design side, we want to use the Barrens events to experiment with end-game open world content in new ways and try to get away from some of the more repetitive aspects of daily questing. As a result, we shaped the events as a series of dynamic events, rather than a straightforward progression of daily quests. We hope this ends up feeling much more fluid and freeform than previous end-game quests, with players of both the Alliance and Horde rampaging around, raiding Garrosh’s supply lines and spoiling his war efforts. Plus, just having the Horde and Alliance together in the Barrens at the same time will open up a lot of opportunities for world PVP.<br />
<br />
This is most excellent. <br />
<br />
Finally we are doing more stuff in the world - apart from dailies - instead of instances.<br />
<br />
Hopes it works out well.<br />
<br />
I hope in the future they mix both together. One thing Blizzard often fails at is swinging the pendulum too far in the opposite direction. I can see a future where we spend all our time riding around old-world zones looking for random spawn events..... I thought Isle of Thunder was awesome and could have been better if some of the player-spawned rares were more éventish´ rather than just a mob to kill... but still have a mix of dailies.<br />
<br />
It is like what they did with scenarios.. players were burned out with doing heroics.. so they made scenarios... and then completely stopped making heroics... now players are sick of scenarios and begging for heroics...<br />

So because there are a bunch of people who quit right after encountering difficulty with something, they have to hold their hand with it because they really want them to participate. /smh<br />

Ya this is becoming the norm now. Look at the constant nerfing of easy normal content.

This really is similar to the LFR issue. A lot of raiders hate that ´newbs´ can see raids with LFR. What they don´t realize is that without LFR, there wouldn´t be 13 boss raids being made.<br />
<br />
The blog spells out the problem, and dismisses a better solution. There needs to be a way to separate new players who start pvping in the middle or end of an expansion away from highly geared players. In pve, you have catch-up mechanisms that keep you from getting stomped because of your bad gear. You have to run the easier dungeons and raids first to get gear. In PvP, there is no catch-up.. the only way to get gear mid-late expansion is to get stomped with no hope of winning for months.<br />
<br />
But really, I am tired of pvp in WOW.. they should do what the hardcore pvpers want, and only let the hardcore people compete. Then because there are so few of them, the devs can stop this stupidity with wasting dev time adjusting gear and talents because of pvp every patch. I mean, this is the third major change to resilience and pvp gear this expansion already... every time they state what their goal is and make it sound like this will help, and it hasn´t..</div></div><hr />

What many of the others have said is true. Blizzard copies everything and twists it just enough to not break copyright laws. Look at how much is a copy of something else just for MOP alone. Their originality has long been diminished.<br />

Here is what blizzard SHOULD have done;<br />
Buff the honor gear to get it closer to the tyrannical.<br />
It is that simple.<br />
That simple buff would render all the other changes pointless.<br />
<br />
It takes next to no commitment grinding full honor gear.<br />
As it is it takes no more than max 2 days casually pvping to gear a fresh char.<br />
And if that is still too much for the roleplayers make vendors sell that honor gear for gold, mid season.<br />
Non pvp gear is not meant to be in pvp, pve players should not expect their pve accomplishments to carry over to pvp.<br />
<br />
Ruining game balance to accommodate pve gear in pvp is just dumb. <br />
It is horrible decisions like this that causes the majority of your sub losses, constant back and fourth screwing with balance; seemingly w/o any clear path/ leadership.</div></div><hr />

Giving everyone baseline resilience is going to be really nice for Player A. Player B is going to continue to do absolutely no damage, while dying only SLIGHTLY slower because he has no health pool. <br />

While there is a certain degree of truth to the &quot;gear is everything&quot; perspective, I love how he completely ignores the possibility of players being aware of their own relative weakness and playing accordingly. If you're undergeared, you can still heal, spot, cc, guard flags, team up with others, etc. Mr. Chilton seems to be talking about a model of WoW where there is zero expectation that players will ever think. Oh, wait, that's the current model for WoW, that he helped to create. :mad:<br />

Event if you get used to it (which is the case with any upgrade) I really hope this becomes succesful and Blizzard will embrace much more dynamic events in upcoming patches and expansions. It makes the world feel more alive and dynamic.<br />
<br />
Ofcourse this is just the first step and knowing Blizzard, they're always careful with new systems like this, but if it's succesful, they will put more of it in. I hope dynamic events become a strong part of leveling in 6.0 and I hope we'll see them in the form of PUBLIC QUESTS where teamwork without a group actually works. With scenario style bosses where you don't really need a tank and deticated healer, these public quests without an actual party can definately become reality.<br />
<br />
Last step is to make public quests scale (health/dmg wise, maybe even more mechanics) with the amount of people contributing it would be ultimate.<br />

Indeed. Not to forget that healers have more and more ways to do some ok sustained DPS these days, when there's not too much healing needed. So if scenario's need a bit less healing, throw in some dps. People need to accept not all content is made specifically for their role. Just like questing and leveling in healermode isn't the most efficient, but it's doable. Same with scenario's. Nothing new in my view.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ogemaniac</div><div class="date">2013-05-18, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;I take it from your posts that you are referring to difficulties killing a healer solo...&quot;<br />
<br />
Given that a healer, of any spec at any time in WoW's history has had a virtually ZERO percent chance of killing a DPS 1v1, why should the DPS's chance be very high, either?<br />
<br />
One of the most frustrating things about playing a healer in bg's is that there are only three possibilities if you find yourself 1v1 vs a DPS (or tank)<br />
<br />
1: You die<br />
2: You run away<br />
3: Someone else shows up and tips the balance<br />
<br />
The possibility of actually killing your opponent is negligible, and only accomplished if you severely outgear them, or stumbled on them while they were on death's door and oom. Even then it is not likely that you will kill them - classes with lots of self-healing, such as DK's or warlocks, would have to be asleep in order to be killed by a healer.<br />
<br />
I have always thought that healers should do much more damage than they currently do. It would have minimal impact in PVE. In fact, I think it would be a positive, as it would allow for fights where healers switched between healing and DPS during different phases. Currently, healer DPS is so low to be negligible in such cases. If it were tank-like, in contrast, such fights could easily become reality. As for PVP, what would it change? If it made healers OP in organized PVP, that could be balanced by slightly lower healing. It certainly would make unorganized PVP a lot more fun for healers, and you would likely see more of them as a result. No one likes finding themselves where the only possible outcomes are lose or tie. It is absurdly frustrating.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jamie71</div><div class="date">2013-05-20, 09:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">MOP made me quit PvE completely and PvP is not looking to good. I still think they are clueless and the resoning behind the PvP changes is way of base.<br />
<br />
I dinged 90 and worked my way to a full honor set with 0 crafted items. Especially in random BG where most people are headless chickens you can easily be usefull in fulll blue questing gear. Imagine the outrage in PvE if armor sets making you ready for the latest tier of raiding was given freely to fresh 90´s??<br />
<br />
IMO the problems in PvP are:<br />
<br />
- It´s all become a CC/burst timing game, with blanket CC/silence being way out of control<br />
- Infinite mana pools. Even OOM´ing a healer is no longer an option<br />
- Instant casting.. Hard to silence/interupt when 90% of spells are either instant casts or uninteruptable<br />
- BALANCE.. Yes this a major issue. Some classes are extremely OP thus making some arena combos godlike<br />
- Imbalance of selfhealing on non healer/hybrid classes. Rogues can vanish and recoup indefinently, warriors second wind, warlocks are almost tanky etc, while a class like DK has almost 0 selfhealing.<br />
<br />
A few personal gripes<br />
<br />
- Choosing the skills that are and are not allowed in Arena. Like Warlock tele portal on multiple level arenas.<br />
- Severe skill/ability/spell bloat. You need a razer Naga 9000000 and 200 macros and 400 keybinds to play properly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well PVP is the only thing i do now, and your post has hit the nail firmly on the head,<br />
<br />
a couple of other points id like to make is why is anything that takes an iota of effort removed from the game, <br />
<br />
example gearing up a pvp set? why bother now? why not just run LFR till your ready to commit Harakiri to get gear then go do some pvp.<br />
<br />
Also by making everything so easy to get now you take away any sense of achievement, People expect everything now , they dont want to work for it<br />
<br />
they dont respect those that have played the game like myself for 6 years and know what the basic tactics are for say AV or AB or EOS.<br />
<br />
Your filling the game with scrubs, its hard enough now to get descent players who want to put effort into anything. <br />
<br />
80% of my guild has stopped playing wow, they have all gone to LOL because there fed up with the WOW bullshit the whiny scrubs that play <br />
<br />
and as far as i can see your bending over backwards to accommodate them . You will lose a lot more people, And I really dont understand why <br />
<br />
your constant tinkering with PVP, one last point , <br />
<br />
now that PVE gear is viable in PVP are you going to make PVP gear viable in PVE? nah didnt think so.</div></div><hr />
