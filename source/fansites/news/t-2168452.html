Patch 7.2 - Assault on Broken Shore<br />
Khadgar will have a new quest (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/46730-armies-of-legionfall) for you once Patch 7.2 is live, sending you to the Broken Shore to fight the new Legion presence. This quest sends you into the Assault on Broken Shore scenario, where you head down to the Broken Shore, fighting your way through the Legion presence on the beach, island, and up to their ships. <br />
<br />
Familiar faces such as Velen (http://wow.gamepedia.com/Velen) and Illidan (http://wow.gamepedia.com/Illidan_Stormrage) will fight alongside you. Completing the scenario unlocks the outdoor Broken Shore area and rewards an item level 855 helm (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/146729-ph-broken-shore-scenario-cloth-hood) and item level 860 Order Hall Armor Set upgrade item (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/146721-archmages-grandiose-armor-kit). <br />

Ghostcrawler - Reaction to Players Unsubscribing<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Unsubbing is often seen as the only ‘real’ way by players to express their displeasure in a way that affects the devs. However, one thing I’ve never known is how devs themselves react to this. Do you double down? Scrap plans? Abandon the game?<br />
There are a couple of different ways to answer this.<br />
<br />
Developers do care if you stop playing their game and they want to know why. However, for games like WoW and LoL, the answers are almost always “I have less time to play now (job/school/family” and “My friends don’t play anymore.” (I’m basing that on having seen a lot of data - it’s not super open to debate.)<br />
<br />
Dropping a game because of a specific design change (despite what you might read on forums / Reddit) is actually pretty rare. I know it happens, but if you’re stack ranking the reasons why people quit, those specific responses end up being so far down the list that it is hard for a development team to take actionable feedback. It’s really rare you see “Wow, that change we made cost us 10,000 players. Let’s revert it!” So overall, I would not advocate boycotting a game as a way to make a statement, especially if deep down you still love the game. You’re just not likely to drive change as a result.<br />
<br />
(As an aside, the best way to drive change is still to try and clearly articulate your concerns in some public forum and hope that the developers take it seriously. I have talked to plenty of players to know how frustrating that answer might be, because at the end of the day, there just isn’t some kind of magic key that you can use to 100% guarantee that you will unlock that lock. Nevertheless, it’s still the best hope you have.)<br />
<br />
Now, there are long term trends in the lifespan of a game. At the end of the day, I have really only worked on three games (Age of Empires, World of Warcraft, and League of Legends). All three are games that have lasted for many years, but there are macro trends of engagement, meaning sometimes you’re gaining players and sometimes you’re losing players over the course of a few months or a few years.<br />
<br />
And it’s interesting. When you see a lot of players leave over the course of say half a year, it usually spurs two diametrically opposed views on the development team. You will get one faction of “Players are getting bored - we must be bold and innovate!” You get another faction of “We are changing the game so much that we’re losing our soul! We need to get back to basics!”<br />
<br />
Like with so many things, it’s rarely so cut and dried that you must pick one of those directions over the other. Often the answer ends up being that you need to innovate in one direction, while still making sure the game is easy to return to, and perhaps even getting back to something familiar or even nostalgic in yet other designs.<br />
<br />
My perception has been that the players and developers in the “We’ve changed too much!” camp tend to be those who are less engaged with the game than they once were. Losing track of change usually happens to players who once played every day and are now playing once a week or once a month. They remember being super engaged with the game and knowing everything that was going on, and so the dissonance of that no longer being the case for them is really striking, perhaps even alienating. On the other hand, players who are still really engaged are the ones most likely to need something fresh and new so that they don’t run out of stuff to do. <br />
<br />
Overall as a developer, I tend to advocate being bold and innovating. This depends a lot on your business model. Some games really want to create new players as a fast as they can because they can’t hold on to current players for very long. (That’s not a holistic criticism - it’s just a different model.) But a game like League tends to be more reliant on keeping current players than it is on attracting new ones. (Example: if you’re a young man in Korea, chances are you either play LoL or have decided it’s not for you. There probably isn’t a young man in Korea who has just heard of this new LoL thing and wants to try it out.) For League, we weigh most of our decisions on resonance with active players. Yes, it is entirely possible to change so much that you drive players away, but we think the risk of stagnation is greater. So for League, the answer is usually double down. YMMV.

Most of his questions are being asked about game dev work in general, and whether you agree or not, much of his insight on it, past or present, is still relevant.<br />
<br />
Example: How he said &quot;Highest reason for player drop off is due to available time or friends not playing&quot;. That is 100% relevant to WoW, LoL, and almost any other persistent game on the market today. Design changes, almost always, do not drive mass exodus of players.<br />
<br />
He may not work for Blizzard anymore, but he still has relevant insight to the industry.</div></div><hr />

Lol. Why does your blood boil because what he says? He works outside of blizzard now, so he can open up for more of these wow questions, while before he had to be more careful what to say. His insight is more valuable now then before. I find it helpful, and often skim through those GC posts if I find the question interesting. <br />

A world first guild saying balance is great AND GC saying people don't leave because something got nerfed? This comment thread will be exciting!<br />
<br />
Balance is better non-competitively for DPS. It's still pretty bad in general when some specs are completely situational with hard downsides and some are good for every situation with little downside.<br />
<br />
For a world first guild to say &quot;balance is great&quot; and stack only a few classes is just them lying through their teeth to ass-kiss Blizzard into looking the other way if their guiild members happen to break the EULA.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">anon5123</div><div class="date">2017-02-13, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So overall, I would not advocate boycotting a game as a way to make a statement, especially if deep down you still love the game. You’re just not likely to drive change as a result.<br />
<br />
So what are you supposed to do? Sit there and play a game you don't enjoy, hoping and praying that the developers might change it?<br />
<br />
The devs won't listen to us, they just keep changing the game in ways that stray further and further from the original game. Now it's practically World of Diablocraft, with homogenized classes, bland generic gear, random drop legendaries, instant gratification everywhere, no difficulty to anything except high m+ and mythic raids....<br />
<br />
WoW is too far gone, too far from the state I enjoyed it; it would require absolutely drastic changes for me to truly enjoy it again. That's why I'm unsubbed and currently playing an older version that I enjoy much more.</div></div><hr />

There's always a top spec in terms of balance. It's impossible to perfectly balance the numbers.<br />
<br />
I'd say the fact that all specs are viable is enough to say Blizzard did a good job.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hirako</div><div class="date">2017-02-14, 05:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Am i the only one who finds it weird that they think class balance is fine, yet they stacked 3 DPS?<br />
<br />
It's impossible to have every DPS spec of every class to have the exact same numbers. There will ALWAYS be one class/spec that does higher numbers and top tier guilds will take advantage of that. With that being said, it doesn't mean the miners aren't balanced. You don't need those numbers to be the same to say they're balanced.</div></div><hr />
