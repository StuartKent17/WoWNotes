It says in the fine print that if you buy them now and attach a collectors edition, you will get a 25 dollar credit to your account at some point, but you'd REALLY have to want these now to do that.</div></div><hr />

Different mounts you can obtain. Anniversary events give you deathwing mount, ram and wolf mounts<br />

These are attached to the 15th anniversary collectors edition which may have confused you</div></div><hr />

Blizz was pretty upfront about this when they announced the anniversary stuff months ago. We knew these mounts were gonna be store mounts in addition to part of the collectors edition. And as others have said if you bought collectors edition and want these now, you'll get refunded for em when it comes out.</div></div><hr />

i dont hate them being store mounts per say, but at least wait til the actual CE it comes with comes out... not months prior?<br />
<br />
this just seems like desperation</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Completely invalidating them and forcing their buyers to nonsense nonsense&quot;...<br />
<br />
These 2 mounts don't sell the Physical CE, the box and statue do. These 2 mounts being offered at the store is in keeping with how other CE rewards have been working for quite some time now. <br />
<br />
Whilst it's no doubt timed (not desperation, business 101) to boost numbers for the report, not a single fucker worth respect would be &quot;forced&quot; into buying them or feel that their physical CE that they ordered is somehow invalidated.</div></div><hr />

In what way exactly are they desperate...? Seen people make that claim so many times over the past decade, that any and all stuff added or announced spells &quot;desperation&quot;... <br />
<br />
If they're in a state of desperation, do you really believe 2 store mounts (which many of us won't buy anyway) would make a difference? Store mounts do not keep players subscribed and playing, which is needed for players to see value in store items to begin with.</div></div><hr />

that is exactly what a company desperate for a quick cash influx (48 hours pre quarterly report) would do.<br />
<br />
that's business 101. I just wish they had used 2 different mounts instead of taking from a CE that isn't even released yet.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, people like me who did foolishly get the CE are waiting for them to release to collect the $25 rebate (not even the mounts now, just a rebate lol) <br />
<br />
it is one of the most transparently desperate move i've seen a company make in a bit pre quarterly report. They must not wanna go to their shareholders and say they have notta at ATVI</div></div><hr />

So you're salty you spent money on something you didn't want to buy?<br />
Ties nicely into exactly what my point was. <br />
<br />
Desperation means struggling. If you think Blizzard's struggling and thus must grasp for the cash influx that they'll get from these pretty underwhelming (by store mount standards especially) products, then I've got a bridge to sell you in China.<br />

Wow that dislike ratio and the Youtube comments.... makes this board look like its just full of shills :P<br />
<br />
Been a constant for a while now, ever since Classic entered later development stages, really. Even videos announcing new content, survival guides etc are heavily downvoted by the crowd only wanting their own preferred news and nothing else. <br />
<br />
And I'm 100% sure there are no &quot;shills&quot; on these forums. It's also against the rules calling people such.</div></div><hr />

You don't have to shill so hard here, we're all still (somehow) wow fans or we wouldn't be here.<br />
<br />
It's just desperation, and blizz could do better. <br />
<br />
at least save these mounts for the store until the day the actual CE comes out. or not, i got it for the rag statue anyway and don't plan on playing retail so /shrug</div></div><hr />

Seem pretty obvious to me considering you literally said this crap would invalidate your purchase.<br />
Another one using the &quot;shill&quot; argument because they simply do not have anything of value to contribute. Conspiracies all around, eh? <br />
<br />
Sad.<br />
<br />
The one time Blizzard became desperate in regards to WoW, was during WoD. And it was not financial ruin they were facing, it was about player goodwill and retention long-term. They still pulled in 800 million USD on a bad year from the product. If they were desperate, they wouldn't release store mounts considering the backlash it creates (and yes, rightly so) from the online sphere where the vocal people are.<br />
<br />
It's a blatant move, but desperate? No.<br />
<br />
I'm reporting and moving on. Can't be bothered with people so dedicated to fallacies whilst showing a complete and utter lack of self-control.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I said it kinda invalidates the selling mount of the mounts with the purchase. Why don't you calm yourself a bit there with the defensiveness.<br />
<br />
They are desperate which is why they keep releasing store mounts. It's abusing whales for short term cash influx right before the qtrly report. It's kinda a mobile game move, which i guess makes sense for the new blizz<br />
<br />
the mounts were kinda on the lower end of why i got the CE so not a big deal for me, but it is bad optics for them which is why it is MUCH more downvoted than the last few store mounts. It's just not a good look for them, and i luv blizz so i want them to do better.<br />
<br />
I'd have just handled it differently is all /shrug. Put them up the day it dropped with the CE and introduce new mounts now.<br />
<br />
It's not so much the putting store mounts up 2 days prior to 3rd qtr report that is the desperate part, i mean it is but that's 100% fine. It's plucking the mounts from the upcoming CE that ring of desperation.<br />
<br />
Regardless, we can agree to disagree Queen. Good talking to you, and have a wonderful night!<br />
<br />
EDIT: wait, did you really just threaten to report me over... nothing at all? lol. i mean ok, but i'm sure the mod is gonna luv wasting his or her time on that waste of time</div></div><hr />

Yeah, it's sad that 15yr veterans aren't getting anything as cool as the Statue from Year 10. Kinda figured 15 years would have meant something given that that length of time for any game is almost impossible now, but it hasn't really been 15 years since everything reset at Activizzard day.</div></div><hr />

we knew this from the start, the CE made it very clear, also you can buy it, and when your CE comes in, it will give you 25$ on your account.<br />

<br />

<br />
no, not how it works, see this is why your wrong.<br />
<br />
a reskin is when you get a model and put a new skin on it.<br />
<br />
think of it like this, if you get a cat and skin it, then put a dog skin on it, it will not look like a dog... You cant just change what the shape looks like, you need to change the shape itself.<br />
<br />
But if you took it down to the bones, put dog flesh on it, and then the dog skin, it would look like a dog, almost atleast.<br />
<br />
That is why models are not skins,<br />
<br />
A skeleton is the bones<br />
a model is the shape<br />
a skin is the texture<br />
<br />
you cant interchange them...<br />
<br />
<br />
for example in the top there you coudlnt just take the skin of the phoenix and put it on the protodrake and say its suddenly a phoenix, it needs a new model.<br />
<br />
skin is whats on the surface, not the shape of the flesh beneath.</div></div><hr />

The previous store mount came out not really that long ago. If Blizzard had at least waited until the anniversary to put them up on the shop, it might not be received that badly.<br />

They aren't fighting just whining. I don't have an active sub that's fighting not bitch on forum while giving them money. Though, I don't really mind store mounts not that I can buy them with tokens before tokens, I cared though.</div></div><hr />

I like the mounts but I ddin;t buy the collectors edition so thats my own fault. I have no problem with exclusive collector items. The Mini Diablo, Panda and murloc pets from Vanilla was the same thing through its own collectors edition.<br />
<br />
Now I can see how putting it on the store can be a good thing as it can provide people who couldn't afford the mount a way to get it through other means , and thats pretty cool. Only problem is, it;s just another store mount and store items are a cancer as far as I am concerned when we already sub for a full price game.<br />
<br />
Personally I would have rather they made it collectors only. But nothing I can really say is going to do make me sound different. Blizzard are not going to change it and I am sick of complaining about it. I can only shrug at this point.<br />
<br />
Thankfully for me the store doesn't affect my own enjoyment of the game. I can still enjoy WOW regardless of their horrible practices through their cash shop</div></div><hr />

hehehe, you just prove my point... he has golden stuff on him... so you get the feel that he is made of Stone or marbel.... but these anniversary moint have the same color on everthing.... even the Plate thing they have on their chest is Marbel... so it just feel like a bad paint job.... with no tought what so ever... and again... having an Animated thing with 1 color makes your eyes go crazy since there is no Contrast...<br />
<br />
If you also see they have a sadel... why not make it look like a real sadel.... and then the breast plate... that would make it 10 times more awesome and at least you have some Contrast... this looks like some Modern painter just color 2 eyes on a white back ground and call it art XD</div></div><hr />

Celebrate by purchasing? Oh Blizzard, why are you so silly?<br />
<br />
It’s their anniversary, so we have to buy them a present. And in this case, we give them money and even get something in return!<br />
<br />
Yeah, I find it stupid too, but at least we do get the raid and Deathwing mount, so we can celebrate without paying as well.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, nobody (and by nobody, I mean me) really gives a shit about any mount anymore. How many are we up to now? 400? It’s honestly become like Pokémon... gotta catch em all!

The previous store mount came out not really that long ago. If Blizzard had at least waited until the anniversary to put them up on the shop, it might not be received that badly.<br />
<br />
Right now, it just looks like putting two (three, but the alabaster ones change per faction) mounts on the shop in quick succession.<br />
<br />
This is exactly it. The optics look bad a few days before their report to shareholders. A quick desperation of cash influx<br />
<br />
Had they put out other mounts instead, and dropped these 2 during the CE release I doubt there’d be a fuss. It isn’t like they are special looking anyway imho<br />

I genuinely don't think Blizzard are the bad guys for making store mounts, it's probably not even up to Blizzard, they obviously are aware of the negative reaction and know they're pissing people off - it's the people that enable the suits by repeatedly buying them. Imagine a different timeline where store mounts didn't take off and all the mounts in the store today were available in game some way. The anti-consumer consumers don't understand this sadly. <br />

I mean, even that's not going to change anything. I believe there's a contingent of at least a million wales who will always be subbed to wow, regularly use character services and buy every mount/pet - I see so many Sylvian dreamers it's ridiculous, as long as those people exist, these practices will continue.

Y'know what's sad - these mounts obviously took very little resources to make compared to most store mounts, imagine the reception if Blizz just gave them to you for the 15th anniversary - the DW mount for doing the raid, the wolf/ram for doing the PVP, and the faction mount for actually playing the game. It's not a huge deal - but to actually give players something cool rather than expect them to pay for it to celebrate the anniversary, would have been nice.</div></div><hr />

It literally is though. So the beak is slightly different and there's less fur sticking out because it's supposed to look like a living statue. <br />

Blizz was pretty upfront about this when they announced the anniversary stuff months ago. We knew these mounts were gonna be store mounts in addition to part of the collectors edition. And as others have said if you bought collectors edition and want these now, you'll get refunded for em when it comes out.<br />
<br />
Not really a refund if it's just BNet balance that you can only give right back to them. Not very charitable if you ask me.</div></div><hr />

It is a new model. And many of the differences were quite obvious about it. Some of the more obvious being the head, claws and tail, some of the less obvious being the smoother body and the cracks. Even if they did use the old model as a basis and work from there, the alterations make it a new model or if you wish to be pedantic: an updated model, not a reskin.</div></div><hr />

Yeah but see, the difference is that FFXIV is actually good, while WoW on the other hand...<br />
<br />
<br />
One complements a good product with some fun bonuses for those who want them, the other is pumping mounts in the cash shop in order to boost end of quarter revenus to keep shareholders happy, all the while not giving a flying fuck about the player's enjoyment.<br />
<br />
I'll tolerate a cash shop if the game is good and the stuff in there is purely cosmetic, but when the game sucks, and they're just compensating their sub losses by selling us crappy 25$ mounts? Then hell to the fuck no, I won't stand for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think FFXIV is the game you want to go to war with when it comes to cosmetics and value. FFXIV shoves more freebies on you than anything I've ever seen, sometimes you want to laugh and beg the game to stop when it's randomly putting entire sets of cosmetic armor into your inventory like an elderly woman with chocolate bars on Halloween. <br />
<br />
The current active event gives a full set of cosmetic gear, with multiple change outs, and some housing items. The last event gave a four seated mount, a full set of cosmetic gear, a hairstyle and music scrolls for your house/apartment.<br />
<br />
Also, the bowl of oranges was a reward from a past Heavensturn. Thing is FFXIV does not really repeat events, they have new ones, with new storylines, rewards, mechanics, etc each year. They give a ton of cosmetics, emotes and housing items from those. About a year later they take the old event items and put them on the shop, which I think is a fair compromise.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be sore about cash shop in WoW if they treated things more akin to FFXIV. In WoW though you get so very little. Miserable, recycled events, never any new hairstyles, no emotes, no dances, nothing barely at all. <br />
<br />
They can't even update the armor past classic. Same robe model 15 years later, just slap a different texture on it and hope no one notices.<br />
<br />
Let us not even get into housing and the glut of art assets that requires. Not that I would have confidence for Blizzard to support it properly but I'm still perturbed about even the basic concept being as mangled and abandoned as it was.</div></div><hr />
