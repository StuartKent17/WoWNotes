When immune to the stun of following abilities, Maim, Bash, and Hammer of Justice will no longer cause player spells to be interrupted but they will still interrupt NPCs.<br />
The Retribution Paladin talent Vindication no longer reduces the targets stamina or intellect but does correctly lower agility, spirit, and strength as mentioned: http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=17631617432 (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/5/17631617432-vindication-talent-change.html)<br />

Vindication Talent Change<br />
We are in the process of completing a hotfix that could go live as early as this afternoon that will make the Paladin talent Vindication no longer reduce Intelligence or Stamina from the target it is applied to. The talent will continue to reduce Agility, Spirit, and Strength as it currently does. We felt this change will help balance the ability out, especially in the lower arena brackets where they are very prominent, while not being a negative impact on a Retribution Paladinâ€™s PvE dps.<br />
<br />
Once this hotfix is live, the tooltip will be incorrect until we can update it in the next content patch. <br />
<br />
Why with Ret is it always a hotfix for any other class it's ok to let them dominate an entire arena season?<br />
Increasingly it felt like someone playing against a Ret-Pally really only had 60% of their health bar because Vindication took away 20% from the start and then Hammer of Wrath kicked in when they had 20% left. This change was something we could confidently hotfix and would have a minimal to no impact on the PvE side of things. <br />
<br />

ETA for classes Q&amp;A<br />
We are working on them pretty much everyday. We hope to get the first couple up this week but like I have mentioned before, these take a lot of coordinating with other regions and in turn translation to get them all ready together. You will start seeing some soonish. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/17615565513-why-do-people-say-that-blizzard.html))<br />

[US] Mountain Dew In-Game Pet<br />
The in-game pet is not available yet. A few things still need to be completed before it will be available so I don't have an exact time frame to provide. Keep an eye out though as it isn't too far out. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/17617975297-mt-dew-ingame-pet.html))<br />
<br />
Only one Auction House<br />
There are multiple NPCs in each major city that link to one Auction House. Splitting up into a separate auction house for each city is something that was somewhat done years ago and wasn't a big plus for the economy.<br />
<br />
We also don't feel that the auction house really needs to be connected through NPCs in Outland or Northrend or anything as those are areas where front line battles are taking place and not quite as focused on merchant sales. We want players have a reason to visit the home cities and the AH is one of the reasons that fits this nicely. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/17616155424-why-is-there-only-1-ah.html))<br />
<br />
Crowd Control in Arenas<br />
The point I was making was that a common sentiment seems to be:<br />
<br />
1) Only classes with multiple forms of CC on different DR (typically embodied by the Frost mage) are capable of playing intelligently and with finesse.<br />
2) If you aren't one of these classes, you are only faceroll.<br />
3) Faceroll classes require no skill. It's the class winning, not the player.<br />
4) Therefore, it is offensive if faceroll classes ever win.<br />
5) Therefore, those classes really shouldn't be represented in Arena.<br />
6) The only way to fix this problem is for every spec and class to have equivalents of Blink, Frost Nova, Polymorph etc.<br />
<br />
Number 6 just isn't our design, and it definitely homogenizes the classes more than we are comfortable with.<br />
<br />
Even if you want to argue that warriors are too weak in PvP at the moment, which I don't think is a foregone conclusion, they have certainly been quite capable at points in WoW's history. If you are of the mindset that warriors should never be in that situation because they are a faceroll class, then your vision for WoW PvP is probably at odds with that of the developers.<br />
<br />
We think classes are capable of playing with finesse even if they aren't a class with layered CC and escape mechanisms. What I mean by that is that you need to play intelligently and respond to your surroundings. You need to use your cooldowns at the right time. You need to sometimes at least think about switching targets. Even if warriors aren't there at the moment (again debatable) we don't really think warriors need a couple more types of CC and escape mechanisms to get there. With the addition of Juggernaut, they probably have all the tools they need and it's just the numbers that might need adjusting.<br />
<br />
Some of you just need to untangle the definitions of cleave, burst, melee and faceroll and stop using them all completely interchangeably. It's imprecise and just confuses everyone else.<br />
<br />
Now, in those situations where a class or spec just beats someone over the head with MASSIVE DAMAGE and doesn't have to be particularly clever or even sentient to win, then that is faceroll, that is a problem and not at all what we want in the PvP game. I don't think warriors are in that spot now. DKs and Retadins have been there before. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17616155423-gc-you-nailed-it-on-the-head-bravo.html))<br />

Turning off achievements announcements<br />
An option to turn off achievement announcements is something that has been brought up in the past but currently we don't plan to implement. While initially there was a lot of achievement spamming when the system launched, it has calmed down considerably to where even seeing alts complete things isn't much of an issue and you can pat your friend on the back for completing something for the 3rd time on an alt.<br />
<br />
You can turn off seeing other peoples' achievements by going into the chat window settings and turning off the achievement announce in the 'other' category, but I understand that this is not what this thread is about.

Chaos Bolt ignores Deterrence<br />
Deterrence is an unusual ability -- it grants spell deflection. Chaos Bolt always hits, so technically it is working correctly by ignoring Deterrence. We don't see any reason to change this behavior at this time. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17631617053-why-does-chaos-bolt-still-pass-detterence.html))<br />

Vindication Nerf<br />
If an class is so powerful among less skilled players that it dominates but totally ineffectual against the best players in the world whose skill is high enough to counter it, we don't think that makes it balanced. The game needs to be fun for everyone, not just the most elite players. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17615565589-the-vindication-nerf-was-so-stupid.html))<br />

MP5 on Gear<br />
Regardless of any other changes we might make, mp5 just doesn't seem to provide enough point for point on gear. It's possible (likely?) we'll just increase all of the mp5 on gear. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/17631617314-paladins--should-we-start-collecting-mp5.html))<br />

Shaman changes in 3.2<br />
The class Q&amp;As are not lists of patch notes. Many of the questions are more philosophical in nature. The Resto shaman list of patch notes is shaping up to be among the longer ones this time around, but we aren't quite ready to share the specific changes yet. <br />
<br />
I mention this so you can help remind players (of any class) when they respond to the Q&amp;A with &quot;But they didn't buff my spell.&quot; (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/17619782879-shamanpve-is-blizzard-still-not-convinced.html))</div></div><hr />

Vindication reduces Stamina not Health. On my character that's 13% initial reduction instead of 20%. Hammer of Wrath range is then even slightly lowered, for me it's 18% instead of 20%. Meaning I play with 69% health pool instead of 60%. That's still pretty amazing but It's just a matter of time before Retribution Paladins call him out on his mistake.<br />
<br />
P.S. These are my numbers from my character, I sure other people will have different ones as this debuff essentially scales with gear.</div></div><hr />

I thought it was because of the reduction to health that Vindication was good, that's why they are getting rid of Stam in the -20% stats :). <br />

come on...at least understand the fu*&amp;ing spell....60% of their health...OH REALLY? <br />
20% stats != 20% health<br />
20% from maximum Hp to hammer != 20% Hp after vindication ....so the window to hammer is smaller...AND FFS i got 4500 AP self buffed and i crit alot with hammer ...but its not always a kill shot ...so the crap with starting at 60% is even bigger BS<br />
<br />

i dont care about the nerfs...im use to them...but this ignorance towards the spell is....................................</div></div><hr />

Rets can't interrupt (don't say hammer), they cant really snare, they have long cooldowns on the cc and now they are removing the 'mortal strike' (I thought the whole point of vindication was to give something like MS/wound) debuff.

Vindication was perfectly fine until a few days of massive QQ which lead to the recent nerf.<br />
Edit: Oh, yeah, I forgot about the recent Retribution Aura nerf due to Rogue QQ. ::)<br />
<br />
What are they going to nerf the next time a burst of QQ comes? Hammer of Justice? Repentance? Sacred Shield? <br />
<br />
Considering the 60% Blue post, I guess Hammer of Wrath is the next candidate... (although, following this twisted logic, wouldn't players who start against Execute classes start with only 80% HP as well?)<br />
<br />
For the love of God, why can't they just focus more on redesigning Rets to stop the endless PvP QQ and make them more competitive in PvE?</div></div><hr />

Am I the only one that sees this a little bit of flawed logic?<br />
<br />
The fact is we had a 20% stats reduction which had been in place for years and it was very balanced when compared with the 50% healing debuff.</div></div><hr />

Calling it before another one of these rolls around. Nerfs to Repentance, Judgment, and/or Art of War. Because that's the only thing left that people can cry about.<br />

<br />
Not only they don't know how those 2 skills work (didn't they nerf vindication's 20% a while ago alread?), but they also justify it with a reason that would be more than enough to justify a BUFF to ret paladins!<br />
<br />
&quot;skilled ret players crunch noobs&quot; + &quot;skilled ret players are crunched by other classes skilled players&quot; = buff Ret OR unbalanced number of noobs between lower and high ratings.<br />

Because it worked like a mana burn, once the fight start healers would always lose mana. Int nerf is a good idea, but I don't think stamina was needed.</div></div><hr />

You are so late on your QQ. Ret hasn't been able to 2-3 GCD burst ANYONE down since... umm 48 hours after WotLK launched. Ret isn't a viable force in arenas. GC just said if retadins are stomping on you it is because you are shitty and in the lower brackets.</div></div><hr />

Yeah actually you're right. The flood is because Blizzard made Ret much less shitty than Vanilla/TBC. Are they good? If you are a skilled player. Are they viable in this &quot;elite&quot; arena? No. So yeah, you are in the bracket where you will fight the occasional Ret paladin. If you do chances are he made it to 1800+ because he is better than 99% of the other retadins out there.<br />
<br />
And finally NO! For the last time this mythical &quot;I died in 2 GCDs to a ret paladin&quot; myth has to stop. You have over 25k hp and 860 resil. You reduce crit damage by over 23%. You CANNOT die in 2 GCDs. Melee + SoC proc + Crusader Strike + DS + Melee + SoC proc and they ALL CRIT you will probably die. If that happens, buy a lotto ticket. Oh, and fire your druid for not casting NS or Swiftmend. Oh, and fire yourself for not deterring or disengaging.<br />

Comparing Rpal to Warrior or Rogue, they got only better burst, but lack cc, lack slow, lack MS effect. So basicly they dont like -20% hp on arenas, but they hav nothing against -50% of effective health made by MS.<br />

Ret paladins are alot better in pvp in general than in the past, that we both agree on. As far as the occassional ret paladin in arena goes, i believe thats false. They are one of the most played classes in arena now and have high representation in the SK100 (even though that isn't the sole basis for my argument). Cleave/Burst damage is at a high, so i believe you're going to see more than the &quot;occassional&quot; ret paladin. I have died in a HOJ duration from a paladin, as i'm sure many other people have. Did all his abilities crit? maybe. Does it happen quite often? i'd say more often than i would like it to. My druids main is a paladin, and we speak on that issue quite frequently (Mirage's main is Vvax, a paladin on the same server). And as far as me not protecting myself or avoiding the damage.....deterrence has a 1min CD, and i can also be stunned during deterrence which basically screws me over. You're also acting as if the rets partner stands there and does nothing, arena is a team aspect of WOW, so while i don't think you took that into account i will just put it out there, but it's neither here nor there. Resilience is cool and all, but against damage that is mostly magic and unmitigated, it sucks. And a pally can HOJ 3 times before my deterrence is back up, so yea.....ill make sure i do that more.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. yea qwerty MS effects are kinda lame right now, i think 50% is a bit too much. However that is another argument.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really can't count the amount of times I've been completely facerolled by a retribution paladin.<br />
<br />
It takes absolutely no skill whatsoever. You just basically run up to me, apply JoJ, and then time a couple of cooldowns with your swingtimer. Eventually it crits so ****ing hard I go below 20%, at which point you simply take a step away and kill me. Bear Form barely mitigates this at all. Absolutely ridiculous. And you don't even need to apply a debuff that removes a ****load of my HP. (Around 6k in bear form and 4k in cat form) Thank God that last part got nerfed now which should make the burst far more manageable.<br />
<br />
Retribution Paladins simply shouldn't be viable until they can figure out a way for it to demand skill. They have more than failed so far. I am so tired of being killed by Paladins without the slightest hint of a clue... -_-</div></div><hr />

It still reduces the other stats by truckloads, making a huge and pretty much passive cut into mana, regen and damage.<br />

Lowering someone's Health Pool by several thousand made Ret burst a large problem especially when paired with another melee class. <br />
<br />
The root of problem is really how ret does damage. You have 3 abilities and hit them as they come off cooldown. You don't have a particular order or prerequisites for these abilities to do large amounts of damage compared to a Death Knight's diseases or a Destruction Warlock's Immolate. Maybe if Rets had a setup ability like a magic effect that increased damage done, and all the strikes were weaker without it. However, you would have to give Ret an interrupt or something to raise the skill cap of the class and allow them to kill healers besides resto shaman (who need to be buffed too).</div></div><hr />

<br />
They have made Eye for an Eye no longer a useful talent and now Vindication. I really don't see where else I'd want to put these 4 points for my Ret PvP spec.

Obviously none of the poeple making these decisions have actually PLAYED a ret paladin because the state of ret in pvp is worse than it has ever been. Gimmie BC style or even vanilla ret back in a heartbeat. Ya these ninja nerfs to ret while other classes have to wait a year or two to get nerfed is also getting extremely annoying, although this isn't as bad as the nerfs to ret before leveling even started to 80, that is still by far the worst, nerfing based on a level where the clas isn't supposed to be balanced. <br />
<br />
Here is a crazy idea!!! instead of finding more ways to make all paladins quit the game, how about leaving instances alone!!!!! They were fine with no lag whatsoever and now with the lower limit on the number that are allowed I wait routinely for 30min to an hour just to effing get into an instance!!!!<br />
<br />
Start fixing shit that needs to be fixed instead of bending over your flagship class/spec like you have been doing for 4 years. <br />
<br />
Fix the damn instances, or just put them back pre most recent patch when they worked perfectly. Taking 30-60 min just to enter an instance is simply unacceptable.</div></div><hr />

All you guys are saying is &quot;QQ it was so easy to kill people now its more difficult! QQ&quot; Its been 4 years of blizzards idea of how this game needs to be and the imbalances in PvP. <br />
Blizzard has an idea of how this game should be and what classes should be capable of. They impliment it. Thats it. <br />
<br />
Their view have never been balenced. They do nerfs to bring classes more inline with everybody else, and then they do other nerfs becuase they just dont &quot;feel&quot; that its what they want.<br />
<br />
If you realy expect anything else from wow your stupid.<br />
stop wasting your time, get every class to 80 and play which ever one you feel isnt gimped. Becuase everybody thinks their class is gimped. If you have all the classes at 80 then by your logic you can play the 1-2 good classes out there. &lt; The solution to your problem.<br />
<br />
Dont have that much time? To bad? Play another game?<br />
<br />
Lets read into the blue post on the nerf &quot;If a class is so powerful among less skilled players that it dominates [people who dont know what their doing] but it is totally ineffectual against the best players, we don't think that makes it balanced.&quot; That means that all you ret out there are destined to NEVER be the best even if this nerf didnt exist becuase the blue ADMITS ret isnt good vs the best players. Thus YOU ALREADY PLAY A FAILED CLASS. <br />
<br />
Last line of the blue post - &quot;The game needs to be fun for everyone, not just the most elite players.&quot; HAHAHAH Blue said EVERYBODY should have the pleasure of owning ret HAHAHAHA. You guys got nerfed so everybody could have fun beating you just like the best players!!!<br />

Im not gonna cry about the nerf it self but come on lets all agree noone would like the class they play be nerfd every few days and you stand there thinking so the last 4 nerfs didnt do sht eh?...... THE PROBLEM IS THE BURST DMG reduce the dmg and give use some effects that require some actual strategy not just CD waiting.</div></div><hr />

Obviously none of the poeple making these decisions have actually PLAYED a ret paladin because the state of ret in pvp is worse than it has ever been. Gimmie BC style or even vanilla ret back in a heartbeat. Ya these ninja nerfs to ret while other classes have to wait a year or two to get nerfed is also getting extremely annoying, although this isn't as bad as the nerfs to ret before leveling even started to 80, that is still by far the worst, nerfing based on a level where the clas isn't supposed to be balanced. <br />
<br />
Yeah, lets go back to TBC ret, oomaladin deeeps sheeeeeeit!<br />
<br />
no thanks. Ret is in a far better state than it ever has..<br />

Vindication was retarded. It needed a nerf, but I'd definitely like more ACTIVE talents that passive/proc based ones where I can 1 2 3 4 my way to gear. <br />

And thank god that something is finally being done to ret pallies for average players BG's have been very frustrating and 2v2 arena against 2 high burst classes (2 ret pallies or Frost mage,ret pally, etc.) is very frustrating for an average player and not fun at all getting demolished in 2 seconds by insane burst. so again I have to agree for average players this will be a good change.</div></div><hr />

For the last time this mythical &quot;I died in 2 GCDs to a ret paladin&quot; myth has to stop. You have over 25k hp and 860 resil. You reduce crit damage by over 23%. You CANNOT die in 2 GCDs. Melee + SoC proc + Crusader Strike + DS + Melee + SoC proc and they ALL CRIT you will probably die. If that happens, buy a lotto ticket.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You are so late on your QQ. Ret hasn't been able to 2-3 GCD burst ANYONE down since... umm 48 hours after WotLK launched. Ret isn't a viable force in arenas. GC just said if retadins are stomping on you it is because you are shitty and in the lower brackets.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't have over 25k hp but I do have 900+ resilience. I haven't been 1600+ at all in Wrath, and I'll be the first to admit that's not entirely because I just join whoever's team is down a healer.<br />
<br />
But, that said - Yeah, it's not a myth: it does happen, and Ret can certainly do it in this season. Any Ret pally who claims otherwise is just a baldfaced liar. I get frustrated every single time I just 'mysteriously' lose 70-80% of my health in a matter of seconds - but, but, this is the only time I lose to Rets. In my current 2s with a rogue we high-five each other every time a pally is a Ret because he chews them apart and the chances of them hitting that magical crit-sequence are so astronomically low (and because holy pallies are basically immortal).<br />
Losing to a Ret is pie-in-the-sky luck the same way Windfury was pre-BC. Ret needs fixes to the way it deals damage, not nerfs. <br />

I'm not sure about the QQ and what it actually means. Though Bornakk's math does seem severely off. <br />
<br />
What stands out to me though is the fact that this was a hotfixed &quot;fix&quot;. How many other classes get this kind of treatment. I remember arena in BC when it was Druid/Warrior in 2's, RMP in 3's consistently at the top, with those classes having easymode faceroll status, and it was obvious, but nothing there was ever &quot;hotfixed&quot; on those OP classes.<br />
<br />
And yes I realize that to get in the high brackets and stay there does require skill, yet in those past seasons, did that actually hotfix nerfbat them? no they did not. They just let the faceroll continue throughout. And yes I had a resto druid at 70 and it was ridiculous easy and I wouldn't even consider myself a &quot;skilled&quot; pvper. Hell you didn't even have to be pvp specced to do decently. In fact, one of the things I loved to do was to go tree as the last one was dying just to laugh at them getting facerolled losing to a pve specced druid. Yes, that's how easy it was.<br />
<br />
This change does not justify a hotfix, and all the QQ by all paladins, IMO, is justified.</div></div><hr />

If good healers previously were able to just stand and laugh at our attempts of bringing them down, now in addition they will also be able to use one hand to pick their noses while doing so. I assume healing reduction effects still don`t need &quot;balancing out&quot; in their minds.<br />
It`s bitter given the fact that we just have had a serious 3v3 tournament that somehow failed to confirm ret`s &quot;dominance&quot;. The timing is also rather surprising. And the real issues behind the &quot;burst&quot; and the overpopulation of wannabe rets in battlegrounds/low rated arenas are still left unattended.</div></div><hr />

They really needs to speed up (yet another) redesign of Ret spec. I also cannot believe in &quot;they so good in low bracket mon!&quot; talk - I think it have a lot to do with fucked up libram itemization which forces people to get to 1250 rating even if they hate arena. Kinda like combat rogues and lack of sword offhands in S1 and S2.<br />
<br />
It is also very interesting that reflective damage and Vindication were so OP while MS effects are completely balanced.</div></div><hr />

Say a average plate wearer has 1000 strenght, thats 400 ap less, and agility user such as a rogue will lose less AP however they will lose more crit from their agility.<br />
<br />
Not to mention if you play with a warrior you can still stack this with demo shout causing them to lose nearly 1k AP, thats some pretty potent debuffs versus physical damage.</div></div><hr />

but on a serious note, are they forgetting vindication is dispellable? agreed it's difficult to dispell when it procs so often (and wound poison isn't?), so reduce the proc rate rather than remove the effectiveness of the talent.<br />
<br />
i find it hard to see how they can ignore MS after this, though i can already predict their argument will be 'well MS is situational &amp; useless if there isn't a healer', yeah, in 2s maybe, but arena is balanced around 3v3, amirite?</div></div><hr />

priest with a shield is absorbing the first 2 attacks.<br />
tbh i agree with u guys(rogues) that palas needs a nerf. The game is just not workin when rogues is not the most op class in pvp, season 1 2 3, and 4 was just not enough for the rogues to be op, and lets not forget about this season 6 priest rogue facerolling omg2400raiting with full pve gear.<br />
blizz should rly make HEALINGDEBUFF a wep enchant and not a skill/poisen for rogue warr and huntards. and WTF is up with the warriors ? they do more dmg than a retpala they charge like hell(thx for the useless nerf blizz) they have a 75% healing debuff and bladestorm what is blizz thinkin ???<br />
<br />
Yes i play a ret paladin and its just not fair to remove the STAMINE DEBUFF FROM VINDICATION,<br />
give us mortal strike then.<br />
<br />
i hope u guys understand(i now the rogues dont)<br />
But its almost impossible for a ret to take down a healer alone, vendication was a little help but still..<br />

I play a feral druid at 2.2K rating in 2's and I'm absolutely disgusted with rets.<br />
<br />
I really can't count the amount of times I've been completely facerolled by a retribution paladin.<br />
<br />
It takes absolutely no skill whatsoever. You just basically run up to me, apply JoJ, and then time a couple of cooldowns with your swingtimer. Eventually it crits so ****ing hard I go below 20%, at which point you simply take a step away and kill me. Bear Form barely mitigates this at all. Absolutely ridiculous. And you don't even need to apply a debuff that removes a ****load of my HP. (Around 6k in bear form and 4k in cat form) Thank God that last part got nerfed now which should make the burst far more manageable.<br />
<br />
Retribution Paladins simply shouldn't be viable until they can figure out a way for it to demand skill. They have more than failed so far. I am so tired of being killed by Paladins without the slightest hint of a clue... -_-<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry to point that out, but if you actually agree with the nerf (not just by &quot;woot, one less oponent to think how to beat!&quot;), then you also agree with their statement saying that you're a bad player, right? (not even mentioning the wrong % thing).<br />
<br />
&quot;Vindication Nerf<br />
If an class is so powerful among less skilled players that it dominates but totally ineffectual against the best players in the world whose skill is high enough to counter it, we don't think that makes it balanced. The game needs to be fun for everyone, not just the most elite players.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seriously, a Druid that can be facerolled by non-skilleds Rets is really bad at pvp. You're actually &quot;snared&quot; by JoJ?!?! And even wasting a GCD on that crap, they beat you at the same time? LOL You should be disgusted at your lack of skill, not at the paladin class.</div></div><hr />

I feel very sorry for you if you cannot see that.<br />
<br />
Another part of the point was that the retribution paladins in this thread are now feeling completely helpless now that they can't zomgwtfburst stuff down in 6 seconds anymore through completely random numbers. Now, they might actually have to watch out for when their crits happen and apply CC correctly, or *gasp!*: Work together with their teammate to increase their burst. (Even if their teammate is a healer) Preposterous, I know.<br />
<br />
<br />
In the magical kingdom were Rets do have CC's and tools, also SoCommand is a realiable (random will never be that realiable, huh?) seal for pvp and they really can burst something with a brain (+ a pvp trinket and not in greens) in 6 seconds (and can't heal back to full), that could be a viable argument...<br />
<br />
Good times for Rets at lvl 70 when 3.0 launched and your comment could be valid.<br />
<br />
<br />
Btw, Why not the same hate to all the other burst classes without &quot;random&quot; on their even higher burst? Just because Rogues, Mages, etc.. were always like that?</div></div><hr />

You PvP in tanking gear or just stack stamina? For pre-nerf Vindication to remove 5k hp, it would have to remove 500 stamina - meaning you have 2500 stamina in total (about the same as I have on my tank). <br />
You mentioned BoK, so let's make that ~2275 stamina. You also mentioned 2v2, so let's say you roll with a priest for maximum stamina increased, that's 2061 stamina. <br />

Probably 50% of the non-paladin players will take that as true and that all paladins can 3xstun in 1 minute and will start posting everywhere with the other &quot;true ret-paladin facts&quot;...<br />
<br />
That's why I laugh a lot at peaple who can sum the few good things from ret specs pre-3.0 (like the stun wich required 4/5 pre-4pc bonus change arena gear) + few good stuff from post-3.0 (without their nerfs from all the patches from 3.0 to 3.1.3) + few things left after this and put all of it as current 3.1.3 ret paladins...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm curious how one avoids being snared by JoJ - but do agree that there's something a little curious about a druid who shifts into bear form against a class that deals largely magic damage and whose health removing debuff scales with stamina.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
but on a serious note, are they forgetting vindication is dispellable?<br />
<br />
No, because the issue they have with it isn't that it reduces your stats. It's that when it reduces your stamina you lose all the health attached to that stamina regardless of whether the Vindication is dispelled or not.<br />
It's essentially GCDless &quot;free damage&quot; which was the same reason they nerfed Eye.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes I agree it is far too powerfull for the lower brackets, and sure its very ineffective against good players,<br />
but its still 20% less damage you have to do. Congratulations you just nerved a high end rating class from being very viable to completely useless.</div></div><hr />

How many ret paladins do you find above 2200? Honestly there are very few of them and for good reason. Most of what they do is pretty easy to counter and to really gib someone they need to get a lucky crit string.<br />
<br />
With the freedom nerf and the crazy amounts of DKs and warriors it becomes harder and harder to stay on your target even with a good cc chain. Most of the time we have to play outlast with quick switches to force the other healer to waste their mana.<br />
<br />
All of these changes are getting frustrating, especially when they are doing this because of the lower rated brackets. Ohh and before you say it my pally is prot, but this directly affects us as well.</div></div><hr />

--Deal with it. If you can't, there are multiple other classes and/or multiple other games to play.<br />

Vindication reduces Stamina not Health. On my character that's 13% initial reduction instead of 20%. Hammer of Wrath range is then even slightly lowered, for me it's 18% instead of 20%. Meaning I play with 69% health pool instead of 60%. That's still pretty amazing but It's just a matter of time before Retribution Paladins call him out on his mistake.<br />
<br />
P.S. These are my numbers from my character, I sure other people will have different ones as this debuff essentially scales with gear.<br />

soooooooooo..... like one button that chops off 31% of ya health...... is &quot;fine&quot;?<br />

I gather......<br />
Are you going to tell me dispelling vindi is going to &quot;restore&quot; that 31% of hp?<br />

As far as the occassional ret paladin in arena goes, i believe thats false. They are one of the most played classes in arena now and have high representation in the SK100 (even though that isn't the sole basis for my argument). Cleave/Burst damage is at a high, so i believe you're going to see more than the &quot;occassional&quot; ret paladin. I have died in a HOJ duration from a paladin, as i'm sure many other people have. Did all his abilities crit? maybe. Does it happen quite often? i'd say more often than i would like it to. My druids main is a paladin, and we speak on that issue quite frequently (Mirage's main is Vvax, a paladin on the same server). And as far as me not protecting myself or avoiding the damage.....deterrence has a 1min CD, and i can also be stunned during deterrence which basically screws me over. You're also acting as if the rets partner stands there and does nothing, arena is a team aspect of WOW, so while i don't think you took that into account i will just put it out there, but it's neither here nor there. Resilience is cool and all, but against damage that is mostly magic and unmitigated, it sucks. And a pally can HOJ 3 times before my deterrence is back up, so yea.....ill make sure i do that more.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. yea qwerty MS effects are kinda lame right now, i think 50% is a bit too much. However that is another argument.<br />
<br />
<br />
So much wrong in this post... Where to begin?<br />
<br />
Retpaladins are NOT represented in the higher brackets. GC just told us they dominate LOWER brackets but that &quot;elite&quot; players in the higher brackets dominate Ret b/c skill &gt; ret. So even if Ret paladins &quot;representation&quot; in arenas is &quot;high&quot; it is because they are trapped in the &lt; 2000 brackets.<br />
<br />
If you die in HoJ one of three things happened. Your partner did nothing. Talk to him. The Ret paladins partner did something. This is called teamwork. All of the paladins abilities crit. This is called RNG. Talk to Blizzard.<br />
<br />
You do realize that only judgement/HoW are holy damage? CS, DS, melee, SoC procs are all physical and mitigated by armor and are dodge/parry-able.<br />
<br />
HoJ standard CD is 60 seconds, the exact same as your deterrence. With talents HoJ is 40sec. Technically you could glyph for deterrence and get it to 50sec amirite? Even if you don't glyph that means a paladin can HoJ 1.33 times for every deterrence you get NOT 3.0 times.<br />
<br />
You see the problem people have with ret paladins? They are mentally scarred from the first 48 hours of WotLK when AT LEVEL 70 a ret paladin was like an outdoor raid boss. You do realize that they have been the most heavily nerfed (in the shortest amount of time) class in all of WoW history right? Stop exaggerating about ret paladins, climb another 100 pts or so in arena and you will never have to see one again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lets start from beginning:<br />
<br />
-ur calling retlols a no skillers and facerollers? tell me what class is not a faceroll one. Rogue or mage? Just because they got CC? Yeah its soo hard for rogue or mage to push 3 buttons, and sometimes occasionaly use 2 more for extra CC. Classes ar fukkin equal as lons as u play arena friendly build. Try playing shadow priest, try playing combar rogue, try playing fire mage and achive high rating so I will call you better than others, but otherwise as long as u playing muti rogue,disci priest,frost mages u require exactly same skills as dks or retpals.<br />
-i see some of you that u ar being killed in HoJ. Well, ar u playing arenas alone or what? Dont u hav any class which can CC or even DISPEL stun from ya? IF u dont get those things then maybe it means that u cant play this game, not them.<br />
- back in topic, vindication is too op? redusing like 18% hp in comparison to 50% MS effect, which reduce ur effective health by 50%? Well thing before posting ;&lt;</div></div><hr />

One of the reasons there are so many paladins is because of Versatility. You can do everything in game now, DPS, Tank, and Heal. All pretty good too, Ret is no longer a joke spec in a Raid.</div></div><hr />

meh Ret only needed a few changes imo<br />
<br />
personally I would have preferred vindi to be like a negative last stand (temporary loss of hitpoints with a min of 1 hp left)<br />

Not really, Execute is great against some classes, but we have armor and rage to compensate for, whereas Hammer of Wrath is pretty much always a finishing move.</div></div><hr />

Yay especialy when disci shield him self, rogue use CloS,mage us some kind of annoying armor, lock takes less dmg coz of pet, druid put hots on him self - 1% hp and after 2 s 50%hp&lt;well its pretty fine -.-&gt;, other paladin bubble him self. In fact the only way where HoW can finish ya is then u last 1n1 on arena and u dont hav CDs but otherwise when u got 2n2 and u die by HoW it means that there is something wrong with ya or with ur partner 0 its like trinketing out repetance to be caught 10s later by stun - so fukkin smart</div></div><hr />

(not even mentioning the wrong % thing).<br />
<br />
&quot;Vindication Nerf<br />
If an class is so powerful among less skilled players that it dominates but totally ineffectual against the best players in the world whose skill is high enough to counter it, we don't think that makes it balanced. The game needs to be fun for everyone, not just the most elite players.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seriously, a Druid that can be facerolled by non-skilleds Rets is really bad at pvp. You're actually &quot;snared&quot; by JoJ?!?! And even wasting a GCD on that crap, they beat you at the same time? LOL You should be disgusted at your lack of skill, not at the paladin class.<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree with the nerf, absolutely. It is a huge step in the right direction. A large part of WotLK's PvP has been and is about absolutely retarded burst, and pretty much every single time it's come up there's been a paladin involved somehow. This is because the healthpools in WotLK are already extremely small compared to the healing/damage, and what Vindication does is making it even ****ing smaller. This spell was fine in TBC but now it's just bad for the game.<br />
<br />
Also, JoJ is a snare, particularly for a feral druid. I don't care about all your weird definitions of &quot;doesn't go below 100%, isn't considered a snare by our shifting mechanic bla bla bla&quot;<br />
FACT: My movement speed is slowed. I cannot get out of it. You move faster than me when I have it on and you have BoF on or just haven't been mangled yet. It is a snare, and you will NEVER convince me otherwise. It makes the enemy move slower so you can catch up (you have increased movement speed) and it prevents enemies from fleeing. It's that simple.<br />
<br />
Your swingtimer is usually around 3 seconds, so you do in fact have that exact global cooldown you're looking for in between your swingtimerlolbursts.<br />
<br />
Also, I'd like to see you kill a retri pala as a feral. Usually it goes like this:<br />
Berserk, Open, Hand of Freedom, pala spins around and does HoJ. If I don't trinket, I will now lose 50% of my HP. If I do trinket, I can maybe make him use his bubble. Then he heals to full and applies JoJ so I can't run away. Then he does a new HoJ and kills me off.<br />
<br />
Great fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In the magical kingdom were Rets do have CC's and tools, also SoCommand is a realiable (random will never be that realiable, huh?) seal for pvp and they really can burst something with a brain (+ a pvp trinket and not in greens) in 6 seconds (and can't heal back to full), that could be a viable argument...<br />
<br />
Good times for Rets at lvl 70 when 3.0 launched and your comment could be valid.<br />
<br />
<br />
Btw, Why not the same hate to all the other burst classes without &quot;random&quot; on their even higher burst? Just because Rogues, Mages, etc.. were always like that?<br />
<br />
<br />
I do not hate those burst classes because it isn't random and I have a chance to foresee it. They all have some sort of buildup. Paladins have no buildup whatsoever. They just run up to you and start doing retarded damage instantly - maybe taking that little break to apply JoJ.<br />
<br />
You are correct it isn't reliable, and that's exactly what's wrong with it and the retribution paladin spec as a whole. THe reason I agree with this nerf is because it makes that random burst far less fatal so now they'll actually have to use HoJ and Repetence intelligently when their burst does happen. It's not good, but it's better.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Allow me to say that after the nerf to Paladins the pacing of the gameplay has gone down significantly in battlegrounds. Just that. As long as there is a paladin to reduce my HP, the WotLK-lolburst settles in right there for me. I'm pretty happy about this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Forums never cease to amuse me. This thread also has another delicious component. We have all the paladins complaining about their nerf, then we have people who aren't paladins, complaining that the nerf wasn't done years ago.<br />

<br />
Few examples:<br />
<br />
Paladins OP ? Paladins have Basicly 3 Offensive Attacks (Judgement,Crusader,DS,) so how it can be faceroll? I mean how different you can attack? and they have only 2cc abilitys (Rep. and stun with way too long ) No interupts no silences no Healing reduce effects..<br />
<br />
DkÂ´s are OP.Only class with 2 slineces they have all classes best abilitys (dont remember names but..)That green immune bubble A.K.A Paladins bubble with no dmg reduce effect,They have Sacrifice pet A.K.A Warlock Healtstone<br />
They have Grip A.K.A Improved Charge they have stunning pet and cargoyle who shoots abaut 1-1.5k per sec.<br />
So those and all dkÂ´s spell dmg reduce shield slower moving things etc i think i can say they have little bit too much.<br />
<br />
Disc priest:Why you make priest so offensive? its almsot same who there is with him he just run towards you with bubble takes all your buffs away use fear and then he just mana burns all..if hes mate go low on hp he use penance and there he is,free to do what ever (mana burn)and i think it takes too much mana cuz he can just spam it.Just few sec cd would be great on that so he cant spam that while u are stunned or what ever.When burn hits you there is another coming on half way.<br />
<br />
But the biggest thing i wonder is Prot healer palas?You must be kidding?There cant be one healer running around with never ending mana! and it is nerver ending and why O why there is healing &quot;puffs&quot; in prot tree witch isnt &quot;must abilities&quot; to Tank.They got so much Spell power that AARRGHH this pvp is so fucked atm.<br />
<br />
And Destro locks :D If some class is &quot;Faceroll&quot; that is Destro locks.its goes basicly like this:Succubus comes from nowhere and seduces you -&gt; lock cast Chaos bolt/Immolate/Increlie what ever it is and the area stun and then again some of those casts and if u dont have 1k resi 25k hp your done.<br />
<br />
So there is few things what i see little wrong in pvp and i can honestly say im not even close onlyone.<br />
and if you guys just look these things, even a little bit you see the same. <br />
<br />
Sry my bad english<br />
<br />
Maybe this is little off topic but here it goes.<br />

If you are complaining about how hard Vindication made PvP for you it is because you are a low-ranked noob scrub. GC said so.<br />
<br />
Next bottom line:<br />
<br />
GC admits that Vindication is a problem in THE LOW BRACKETS. <br />
<br />
Ret @ high-end pvp according to GC &quot;totally ineffectual against the best players in the world whose skill is high enough to counter it&quot; Therefore Blizzard just nerfed a class in the low-brackets that cannot compete in the higher-end brackets. Yeah. Gj Blizzard. Don't FIX them so they can compete in all levels of PvP, merely nerf their shitty low-end bracket PvP... Fuck you.</div></div><hr />

wow, just wow. So let's &quot;balance&quot; this game around the unskilled players as Bornakk essentially said in his 2nd post....<br />
<br />
Remember this was a &quot;hotfix&quot; nerf. Has your class gotten the nerfbat this way? Or did you have to wait until the next patch to get something fixed, regardless of whether or not it was pvp or pve. Hell, how many classes have had to wait for a buff in the next patch to make them viable in pve, for example.<br />
<br />
Remember when LK came out and the elmeental shaman were stating, with facts to back it up, that their damage was far below where they should be. But did they get a &quot;hotfix&quot; buff that was severely needed? No. They had to wait until a patch to get fixed. Why not &quot;hotfix&quot; stuff like this when there is the imbalance is even more obvious that the supposedly OP vindication.<br />

<br />
Make a new game. Copy previous spells/abilities/graphics. They can be freely altered, so PvE, the actual reason to play, doesn't get shit on, and Blizzard can more easily control the main issues. (Even though it may seem they could give a shit about PvE implications in the sake of PvP, I think they just might.)<br />
<br />
If a group of guys can turn a custom map in WC3 into a worldwide phenom, why the hell can't lazy developers do the same.... Nevermind, I answered my own question.<br />

Ret @ high-end pvp according to GC2x2 at 2200+ is still high-end PvP and it is bloated with retardins which mostly rerollers from other classes just because these were not powerful enough to overcome player's weak skill. Or you still believe that after reroll all of them were blessed with godness skill? What is more likely?<br />

<br />
Intelligent players who were smart enough to see that their current class was gimped past the point of acceptability, rerolled for the most superior class. (You're gonna tell me you'd pick middle of the pack characters because you think it'd be unfair to everyone else?) This means that you have the smartest or most capable players from the other left-for-dead classes joining the ranks of the Retardins. <br />
<br />
Sure, there are plenty of 13 year olds named Legoxxlaszx, but the majority of the quality players were the first to recognize the fault in their class, switch to the most superior, and begin dominating.<br />
<br />
Rinse and repeat for Death Knights. Best players realizing a fresh start for the most powerful class, so you now have 2 factors working against everyone else, not just the fact that the class is OP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea ok, theres basically only 3 special attacks and 1 execute they can use - guess that makes them bad<br />
<br />
how is that any different from any other &quot;finesse&quot; class (?LOLMAGE/ROGUE?!?)<br />
<br />
wtf special attacks does a mage have?<br />
<br />
frostbolt? ice lance? (passively applying 5 stacks of magic debuff so novas cant even be dispelled lol yea complain about vindication more)<br />
<br />
and rogues?! Rogues are o so gud if they can mutilate while PASSIVELY refreshing 4 different poisons at the same time and throwing out the occasional finisher<br />
<br />
Wheres this bullshit argument about how vindication being passive is so op<br />
<br />
As far as utility goes people tend to ignore everything a ret can do since most of the skills are more defensive oriented. <br />
<br />
2 sacs bop freedom cleanses sacred shield 4 defensive auras repentance hoj turn undead heals bubble wings salv (glyph) <br />
<br />
nice 3 buttons<br />
<br />
lets compare vs another melee thats paraded around as super skilled<br />
<br />
sap blind cheap shot kidney shot kick garrote cloak gouge evasion vanish sprint prep expose<br />
<br />
o yea i left out how they can just wear full pve gear because they can avoid all of your dmg for 30+ seconds while sacrificing nothing<br />
<br />
Get over yourselves if you think you're a better player just because you play a class thats always dominated pvp</div></div><hr />

Retardins are not the only who needs adjustments.<br />
<br />
<br />
According to arena junkies the in the top 100 2s teams there are 28 paladins. 28/200 means 14% of the &quot;top-end&quot; 2s has a Paladin. Of those 28 paladins, 42% of them are ret. Meaning about 13 out of 200 &quot;top-end&quot; 2s players comprise this &quot;bloated&quot; count of &quot;retardins&quot; you claim to be facing.<br />
<br />
Roughly 7%. Real &quot;bloated&quot;.</div></div><hr />

so it is normal to QQ as more and more will make us struggle like hell to be in the top teams in arena.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HotsPal</div><div class="date">2009-06-09, 07:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with the nerf, absolutely. It is a huge step in the right direction. A large part of WotLK's PvP has been and is about absolutely retarded burst, and pretty much every single time it's come up there's been a paladin involved somehow. This is because the healthpools in WotLK are already extremely small compared to the healing/damage, and what Vindication does is making it even ****ing smaller. This spell was fine in TBC but now it's just bad for the game.<br />
<br />
Also, JoJ is a snare, particularly for a feral druid. I don't care about all your weird definitions of &quot;doesn't go below 100%, isn't considered a snare by our shifting mechanic bla bla bla&quot;<br />
FACT: My movement speed is slowed. I cannot get out of it. You move faster than me when I have it on and you have BoF on or just haven't been mangled yet. It is a snare, and you will NEVER convince me otherwise. It makes the enemy move slower so you can catch up (you have increased movement speed) and it prevents enemies from fleeing. It's that simple.<br />
<br />
Your swingtimer is usually around 3 seconds, so you do in fact have that exact global cooldown you're looking for in between your swingtimerlolbursts.<br />
<br />
Also, I'd like to see you kill a retri pala as a feral. Usually it goes like this:<br />
Berserk, Open, Hand of Freedom, pala spins around and does HoJ. If I don't trinket, I will now lose 50% of my HP. If I do trinket, I can maybe make him use his bubble. Then he heals to full and applies JoJ so I can't run away. Then he does a new HoJ and kills me off.<br />
<br />
Great fun.<br />
<br />
I do not hate those burst classes because it isn't random and I have a chance to foresee it. They all have some sort of buildup. Paladins have no buildup whatsoever. They just run up to you and start doing retarded damage instantly - maybe taking that little break to apply JoJ.<br />
<br />
You are correct it isn't reliable, and that's exactly what's wrong with it and the retribution paladin spec as a whole. THe reason I agree with this nerf is because it makes that random burst far less fatal so now they'll actually have to use HoJ and Repetence intelligently when their burst does happen. It's not good, but it's better.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Allow me to say that after the nerf to Paladins the pacing of the gameplay has gone down significantly in battlegrounds. Just that. As long as there is a paladin to reduce my HP, the WotLK-lolburst settles in right there for me. I'm pretty happy about this.<br />

If you are complaining about how hard Vindication made PvP for you it is because you are a low-ranked noob scrub. GC said so.<br />
<br />
Next bottom line:<br />
<br />
GC admits that Vindication is a problem in THE LOW BRACKETS. <br />
<br />
Ret @ high-end pvp according to GC &quot;totally ineffectual against the best players in the world whose skill is high enough to counter it&quot; Therefore Blizzard just nerfed a class in the low-brackets that cannot compete in the higher-end brackets. Yeah. Gj Blizzard. Don't FIX them so they can compete in all levels of PvP, merely nerf their shitty low-end bracket PvP... Fuck you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hello!<br />
<br />
A bracket is a bracket as in 2v2, 3v3 and 5v5.<br />
Low brackets = 2v2 and 3v3, particularly 2v2.<br />
<br />
I don't really think it means &quot;bad rated&quot;.<br />

You mean the HoT's that heal for like 400 a tick and confumes 1/6th of my mana pool?<br />
The roots you can dispel?<br />
The stealth you negate by simply making the opening stun not matter?<br />
The Cyclone you can easily trinket, interrupt or outrange?<br />

It doesn't matter what you &quot;think&quot; because you are wrong. GC's post is very straight forward. He is comparing RATINGS as in 2500 Ret sucks and 1300 Ret owns. Not BRACKETS as in 2s, 3s, 5s.<br />

The reason why there is so much burst in WOTLK is because back in BC there used to be arena matches that took almost hours and ppl would just leave or give up cause they took forever,so blizz thought that if they made more burst games would end quicker,and yes..they do end rather quick in a very retarded way,not the best solution to make arena games end quicker,not that it should even be a problem,they should've just kept it the way they had it in BC.Back where people had time to react and come up with a strategy and just took waaaaay more skill than it does now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, so you dispelled my roots. I apply new roots. Oh wait, immune/dispel them also. Very useful.<br />
And they are not immune to it, they just use HoF to get out of it instantly which, by the way, makes the aforementioned roots useless as well for a short duration.<br />
I will never get to 30 yard range of you due to JoJ which means you run faster than I ever can. Since you're melee, you have no reason to stay away from me.<br />
<br />
See, I'd like getting away from you every once in a while since I need to actually cast my heals, let my DoT's tick or simply recover from a lolrngburst by whatever means.<br />
If you had any clue how to play a Paladin, you wouldn't let me. Ever. And once you use your bubble, it's game over. One-hundred percent.<br />

Let's just say that Retri paladins having about 14 times the representation of ferals in high-end arena speak for itself, shall we?<br />

I play on Stormscale EU at 2.2K rating as a feral druid. I talk to people who participate in MLG and other professional tournaments on a daily basis.

LOL a Feral Druid complaining about burst! GTFO<br />
You know... Not only does the feral burst require about 15 seconds to even set up on a decent player and even then might not come off, and on top of that I wasn't complaining about burst, but random burst.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
hes complaining about burst AND feral druids inability to KILL a ret pally because he cant CATCH him apparently....which one is more amusing LOL?<br />
<br />
Just learn to read, alright?<br />
<br />
Of course I can catch him. I just can't deal enough damage to him under any circumstances before I get bursted to oblivion. Maybe. If not, he bubbles, and THEN I get bursted to oblivion. In fact, the problem is getting away from him. Not getting to him. Although granted, I have been having problems with holy paladins using a *very* similar trick. (I still don't care. 115% &gt; 100%. Fact. Just shut it.)<br />
There is, in fact, a surprisingly small, though still large, amount of difference between random 1500-rated paladin and people like Buttermaster, from ZOMBIES. Now that is not to discredit his skill, but it's really the crits that determine whether he gets to kill something or not.<br />
It's definitely nowhere near the other classes. Comparing a 1500 rated Frost Mage and FlÃ½n, there's a WORLD of difference, for example. The low rated mage can burn all his cooldowns on me and still die, but FlÃ½n can beat me using only an Ice Block.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wait a minute... thereÂ´s CC that are difficult to trinket?<br />
<br />
I must get one of those<br />
The point kindda was that using it once = Trinket. Using it second = 3 sec CD = Allowing me to spend half my mana pool for 6K healing = Pretty close to ****ing useless. Although of course I realise that was difficult to comprehend.<br />
<br />

<br />
Also, the only reason I'm NOT linking my armory is because I'd prefer staying anonymous in this shitstorm made by QQ'ing, terribad ret paladins.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Nevermind. Not gonna respond anymore to this thread. You simply cannot comprehend simply things such as getting away from a paladin versus getting to a paladin, or the difference between burst and random burst.<br />
<br />
I mean... if you don't even know that, and if I can't teach you what, there's really no point.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">anyaka21</div><div class="date">2009-06-09, 09:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it's probably time for tri-spec. One that is only pvp. Make new talent trees for each class and have it only for pvp. Sure usable in the world for pvp realms and maybe even farming. But upon entering a BG, make it so it switches automatically to the pvp tree. <br />
<br />
<br />
Thus gives Blizzard the opportunity to balance pvp around pvp and only pvp talents. When you start trying to mix the talent trees with pve/pvp abilities, it's gonna get messed up no matter how hard you try to try and balance things.<br />
<br />
Part of the biggest problem with LK is that people are basically doing 3x or more damage than they did in BC, and realistically only about 75% more health. Thus burst is out of control, and it's not the players fault. It's lack of foresight on Blizzards part for just letting classes get bigger numbers.<br />
<br />
This change, regardless of whether or not it was needed, does not deserve a hotfix. Remember the Starfall/starfire stun talent? It would break rogues out of stealth, and had a 15% chance to stun you as well. Druids could cast it on the fly, on a mount, mount up afterwards, cheetah, etc... But did it merit a hotfix as a gamebreaking skill? It was arguably more of a problem than vindication. But it was not hotfixed. It was patched at the next patch.... Also granted, it was pretty much also gamebreaking for balance druids too. Now, they pretty much have ZERO place in arena. It seems that is the way Blizzards wants to go for Ret.</div></div><hr />

well, enjoy those supposed tears, because chances are in your lowbie bracket, it won't make a dent. Chances are that all the ret's in the 1200-1500 bracket are not specced for pvp, thus the chances of them having vindication are probably less than 50% anyways. Thus they will still destroy you because you suck.</div></div><hr />

Ok, so you dispelled my roots. I apply new roots. Oh wait, immune/dispel them also. Very useful.<br />
And they are not immune to it, they just use HoF to get out of it instantly which, by the way, makes the aforementioned roots useless as well for a short duration.<br />
I will never get to 30 yard range of you due to JoJ which means you run faster than I ever can. Since you're melee, you have no reason to stay away from me.<br />
<br />
See, I'd like getting away from you every once in a while since I need to actually cast my heals, let my DoT's tick or simply recover from a lolrngburst by whatever means.<br />
If you had any clue how to play a Paladin, you wouldn't let me. Ever. And once you use your bubble, it's game over. One-hundred percent.<br />
<br />
Let's just say that Retri paladins having about 14 times the representation of ferals in high-end arena speak for itself, shall we?<br />
I play on Stormscale EU at 2.2K rating as a feral druid. I talk to people who participate in MLG and other professional tournaments on a daily basis. I won't mention any names, but let's just say that the majority agrees that they are tired of Retribution Paladins who get high ratings without any skill.<br />

so your problem in your 2.2k is that you CANT faceroll a paladin 1 on 1?? and you cant run away to let your hots tick? hi pick a new partner class /yawn....you know one with like frost trap, or that can maybe cast some ICE spells, or maybe uses poison that slows, or maybe that can fear, or maybe that can like you know use these totem things that slow peoples walking....pretty sure a team is suposta work as one....</div></div><hr />

<br />
At first I thought it dosn't make a difference. For Information I play(ed) around 2300 together with a priest ...<br />
I found out that those 4k damage I did not have to deal in addition before really made the difference. We played like 10 Games and where often able to chain all our cc (repentance -&gt; fear -&gt; hammer of justice -&gt; Belf-torrent) and it was often not even close to a kill. I had everything procced an popped ... Berserker procc, Greatness procc, Libram procc, Avenging Wrath Popped. I had 100% dps-time on those Warriors and Deathknights. They had no Cooldowns up.<br />
I was not able to kill anything. Even if My Disc did addizional damage... None of those guys dropped.<br />
In the end we allways lost the manawars due to an Innervate that could not be stopped because of cc.<br />
<br />
I don't want to whine but the point is reached were I can't see me kill anything thats 2,3k rated + in 2s. Its allways like this either Ret is overpowered or underpowered because of simple damage dealing mechanics and nearly no offensive toolset. Fighting style is almost recourceless (if glyphed SoB) and the only chance to kill somebody is to deal enough damage in a cc-chain. (the only skill to have is positioning and timing the cc chain, and to use the defensive cooldowns the right moments)<br />
Now ... with the vindication nerf there's the 4k dmg (assuming a 25k health target) that I have yet to inflict anhow. For now I can't in the timespan I have with a full cc-rotation.<br />
<br />
I think I'll just play 3on3 some more ... Cleaver ftw...</div></div><hr />

Funny how yesterday i was talking to my ret friend talkin about what needs a nerf and how futile it is for us to win against certain comps. this really amazes me how they think. As for the nerfing it to create fairness to weaker players i say why not nerf rogue poisons too? very OP vs weak players.<br />
In my opinion:<br />
Needs Nerf:<br />
Rogue (minor)<br />
Enh Shaman (significant)<br />
Warriors (semi-significant)<br />
Death Knights (semi-significant) (desecration)<br />
Frost Mage (semi-significant) maybe a diminishing cooldown or 2 on certain slowness debuffs<br />
