I didn't consider that! I thought it might've been something external from the drop system, but if it is just a secure feature for the legi's that drop already I'm sad.<br />

. It was my understanding that this goes against their design philosophy or have they mentioned going back to this system of party buffs? This is just going to lead to class stacking again and raid leaders will want to bring buff classes to enhance their top DPS players. So unless they plan on giving more classes some comparable buffs as these this is going to cause some major problems.</div></div><hr />

But Diablo is no MMORPG with Raids and shit.. Plus you don't have to wait 1-3 months per legendary drop just to find out, that it's the next bullshit legendary you don't need and throw it on the bank.. Introducing a system like in Diablo in a MMORPG with competitive/group aspects is just plain insanity.. Uh, your friend got lucky and got BiS legendaries? Well have fun watching him pull insane DPS while you fuck around with your utility sephuz/prydaz. Plus they destroyed the aspect of legendaries being something special and hard to get..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow, I expected it will go up only to 30. I wonder what 40 will be like. I get to 27 on PTR, 26 was 50.000% increase and 27 - 75.000% increase.</div></div><hr />

The new abom looks like garbage. Toooooo cartoony and not scary at all.<br />

It really looks pretty bad... Let's just pray they change it since it's still a PTR model, nothing is set in stone.<br />

I sure dont like this thing either, sure its better then whats now but only cause it removes the &quot;I have to stay in this spec&quot; part of the leggy-system.<br />
The actual problem ppl are having is not beeing able to target leggys in any way, then again they said something more is comming and wont judge it yet until they say what they have done.<br />
<br />
I just dont understand why instead of having an easy to get first random leggy they just add a longer follower mission quest-line that rewards a leggy-token at the end that u then can use to buy a leggy you want. Everyone gets atleats one good leggy, the balance between unlucky and lucky players would be WAAAY less and most ppl would be happy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They should remove legendaries instead they add more... I know a lot of top hardcore players who had to stop raiding on their mains because they got only healing or utility legendaries. In the top you cannot afford that shit. You need the two BIS damage increasing legendaries or you will not top the charts ---&gt; You are nothing there, just a heavy rock in the raid team.<br />
<br />
And you fans (who live in the Blizzard's arse) say: &quot;Ohh but they will fix that in 7.2&quot; Who cares? the damage were made. The more legendaries you have the less chance you have for another. Of course I was the first one on this forum who said legendaries will be a cancer for the game but you were &quot;buhuhu huuu&quot;... kids these days.<br />
<br />
I hope whos idea was this legendary thing at the first place will lose his job there are far more better people for his place out there.</div></div><hr />

They should just admit that the legendary system from this expansion is terrible, and put a vendor into the game to let people swap items for some cost. They missed the mark completely, because while it is awesome to get a really great legendary item and be excited about it dropping, the opposite is also true: getting a bad one feels terrible.</div></div><hr />
