&quot;Guardian Spirit (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/47788/#16539-16562) Calls upon a guardian spirit to watch over the friendly target. The spirit increases the healing received by the target by 60%, and also prevents the target from dying by sacrificing itself. This sacrifice terminates the effect but heals the target of 50% 9,000,000%&quot;<br />

<br />
Yeah, people are going to agree with it without realizing that it is making fun of the arguments they have to update yearly (and still haven't gotten right). I can pull up threads from 2008 that say 'the game will be dead within 5 years'. Lol. Not even close. The game will &quot;die&quot; when Blizzard decides it should die.<br />
<br />
The thing with MMOs is that once you pull in the &quot;I have 100 alts and I get joy from leveling alts because it is fun&quot; crowd, you no longer need to do much of anything to keep them happy as a developer. They have purchased a game that they will play for the rest of its lifespan, and very little will change their mind (ironically, CRZ is one of those things, but the losses from that are still acceptable in terms of the overall picture).<br />
<br />
Other MMOs &quot;die&quot; because they NEVER had that demographic in the first place. WoW still has all those people, and all it is losing are 'regular' people who lost interest or 'the switchers', who just inflate every new MMO's ratings for 3 months and then bail because they have short term memory loss.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's clearly OP, let's say you have a 400K HP caracter. You're going to heal for 36.000.000.000, I've juste checked on live that this spell does trigger echo of life which means that even with 0 mastery you get 10% of the heal during 6 seconds so this gives us 3.600.000.000 on 6 sec every 1 sec leading to a hot that ticks every second for 600.000 K HP so unless you get oneshot you can't really die during these 6 seconds which means that this spell gives you a way to get back full life and invincible for the 6 secondes afterwards which my be considered as to OP (especially since you can use it while stunned).<br />
<br />
I don't know if it was really intended to work this way but it clearly tends to overpower this spell and I doubt they will keep it that way</div></div><hr />

Seal of Justice was reworked, and has tooltip errors. No longer lists a movement speed reduction.<br />

The damage and stack values are, of course, still being worked on, which typically displays zeros anyways. The speed reduction not being listed is not an error. They are removing that as per the balance discussion.</div></div><hr />

I don't understand the negative perception it's like a want for it to be doing badly. It's doing incredibly well for an 8 year old game and will very likely be going with as much content as they're putting in it now for another 8 years. It'd still be profitable if it had half as many subs as it has now. 5 million people is a ton. Did Everquest ever have over a million?<br />
<br />
Because more games are out people are playing other things but they haven't abandoned this game by far. I can't imagine this game 'ending' anytime in the next decade.<br />
<br />
Also, any game that beats it will likely be made by Blizzard because it's a mammoth as far as resources and it put together an amazingly well playing game for the computer equipment available at the time. I still remember Furor from FoH saying it was amazing that you could fly a gryphon and see people under you playing in real time as they were playing and next to no zoneing (something in eq that took up to 1 minute per area like Storm Peaks). They know how to make a game that works well. I don't see anything coming close to it for the type of game it is and I'd imagine there won't be anything in the near future that will be near as good, last as long or have more subs (in the genre).</div></div><hr />

Dunno why the Prot Warrior's tier sets have to suck tier after tier. This one is worse than the tier 14 one.</div></div><hr />

If you don't like reading it, and it wastes your time then don't read it. If someone puts the time in and asks questions, spare us some time, don't post stuff like that and actually talk about your standpoint on shaman, instead of ignoring them. GAWD.<br />

I would've abandoned my paladin long time ago had it not being my first character and because I have memories attached to it. Now in all seriousness what the hell are you doing with seal of justice? ppl choose burden of guilt only because they need preventing players from kiting. Please return the design of the seal as it was pre mop. I even can live with lower dmg it had but the design &quot;reduces max speed by 50%&quot; was awesome. please blizz for christ sake don't destroy rets complitely</div></div><hr />

We asked you not to whine. This is whining. Please don't do it. I don't have a lot of time, so I want to actually get something out of reading this thread, and posts like this just waste my time and that of anyone else trying to read this thread. <br />
<br />
My apologies if I sound like a jerk. I'm not going to mention this again.&quot;<br />

OMFG! Did this idiot actually say that?! Holy Fuck! Dude you just proved that your not only a fucking jerk you sound like one to LOL. The audacity of this guy.</div></div><hr />

I'd rather Ghostcrawler keep &quot;ignoring&quot; the shaman class. The last time he (and class devs) &quot;stopped&quot;, we lost our iconic buff totems. So no, thanks.</div></div><hr />
