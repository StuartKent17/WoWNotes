The IRC channel is a bit more successful than what I expected, I'll try to improve it in a few days. For the moment there will be a temporary bot running in the channel during server downtimes announcing when the servers are going up.

First, I'm very happy. 2 or 3 months ago I posted the stats of the [item=34011] possibly dropping from the Illidari Council, but it never dropped. I thought they would add it to the Hyjal/BT Trash loot, but it never dropped. I thought they would add it to the 2.3 patch ... and it dropped ! This shield dropped for Exodus (http://www.exodus-kt.com/) on US-Kel'thuzad from trash mobs on the way to the Illidari Council. <br />

The Final 2.3 Patch notes are now available.<br />
<br />
2.3 is coming today, I guess it's a good time to post the final version of the 2.3 compilation. (And hopefully it will balance the load over 2 days instead of 1 and the site won't crash.)<br />
<br />
Please report anything missing in comments to get it updated. <br />

[anchor=zaprev]Preview<br />
Boss strategies on forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=1666.0)<br />
<br />
When you enter the instance, you can start an event by talking to a NPC called &quot;Harisson John&quot;. A 20 minutes countdown will start and the first boss will yell ... guess what ? You've got 20 minutes to kill him. <br />
<br />
Kill order (If you're not doing the event, you don't have to kill them in this order)<br />
1. Nalorakk (Bear god), 2. Akil'zon (Eagle god), 3. Jan'alai (Dragonhawk god), 4. Halazzi (Lynx god), 5. Malacrass (Big warlock troll), 6. Zul'jin (Bad guy)<br />
<br />
Best case<br />
If you kill the boss in time, you will free a prisonner and get an epic loot as a reward. (The prisoner will open a chest or some kind of other container, a bit like Majordomo).<br />
Once the boss is killed, you get 20 more minutes to kill the next one, and 20 more minutes after the 2nd kill, etc ...<br />
<br />
Worst case<br />
If you fail the event at some point, you won't get the 20 minutes countdown back after a kill. If you couldn't kill the first boss in time, you won't get any of the &quot;bonus&quot; loot for the following bosses.<br />

<br />
The quest reward for [item=33102] is 10 more badges, you get 2 badges from each boss, and 3 from Malacrass and Zul'jin. That's a total of 14 Badges, with 10 more if you get the quest item. This quest is not repeatable<br />

Trading Card Loot<br />
&quot;March of the Legion&quot; is scheduled for release during November.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/siteImages/images/news/2007/october/rochicken_small.gif (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/october/rochicken.jpg) http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/siteImages/images/news/2007/october/airplane_small.gif (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/october/airplane.jpg) http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/siteImages/images/news/2007/october/kiting_small.gif (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/october/kiting.jpg)<br />
<br />
Paper Airplane (1/3)<br />
The most common Loot item from March of the Legion will be a paper airplane manual! After getting the book from good ol’ Landro, you’ll be able to use it and get one of two types of paper airplanes: a small zeppelin or a flying machine that looks like something a gnome might whip up! Each use of the item will produce one of the two airplane models (it’s a 50% rate for both items). With the paper airplane in your bag, you can use that item and throw it at somebody. Once it reaches them, they can throw it back to you or anybody else they see. The best part about these airplanes is that you can make multiples, leave them in your inventory, and then BAM, you can unleash a swarm of paper on an unsuspecting target!<br />
<br />
Robot Chicken (2/3)<br />
The cosmetic pet you get from turning in the Robotic Homing Chicken code will get you Landro’s newest addition to his exotic menagerie. Aside from making all the night elf chicks dig your character, the robotic homing chicken will occasionally do one of two things. Both involve his rockets taking him into the air. One of them involves him landing safely again, the other results in the rockets exploding and sending him to that big twelve-piece bucket in the sky.<br />
<br />
Dragon Kite (3/3)<br />
Don’t worry, it won’t periodically light you on fire or send a horde of whelps at you. Wait till you see players’ reactions the first time you run through Shattrath with Onyxia behind you! Feeling a little cocky on your PvP server? Take Onyxia along to announce your upcoming ganking spree and watch the lowbies run. For those of you who like to make a grand entrance, this is the Loot item you’ve been waiting for! Also, don’t forget how electricity was discovered; if you fly the kite around long enough, you might see a cloud form and strike it.<br />

<br />
if you compare it to the other ranged weapons it's damage is wrong.<br />

<br />
The weapon damage is 279-280 on the longbow, where on the gun it is 223-336 as well as the crossbow. Is this really an error? or no.<br />
<br />
Nope.</div></div><hr />

Hmm...I hope my brother was on his JC last night farming for it. He said he was farming for about 3 hours last night and didn't get it to drop.</div></div><hr />

I don't know how long exactly, but its definitely only a few minutes. The timer starts with looting (so they don't all despawn at the exact same time).<br />
<br />
The despawn is fairly easy to notice as your tank will be disoriented very soon afterwards.</div></div><hr />

They've had that for as long as i know.. 15 minutes it was I believe.</div></div><hr />

After posting this I've heard it's always been 10-20 minutes (different sources...).<br />
It must be shorter than it was though. It never happened to us before and this time we just went there to attune some new players. Until the despawn it really wasn't a very challenging fight.<br />
Does someone know anything about this? I checked some guides and wowwiki but that timer is never mentioned.</div></div><hr />

Patch 2.3 came with only 1 Cenarion Mount color. It's the same as the taxi color (Blue with some Orange)<br />
<br />
You show 5 different colors, and all other 4 are better looking than the Blue &amp; Orange, in my opinion.<br />

<br />
Where did you get the other colors? (Data mining the patch?)<br />
Do you know if or how they might be implemented?</div></div><hr />
