On Friday, June 14 at 2:00 p.m. PDT, we’ll open a new realm in the WoW Classic Beta for dedicated testing of Alterac Valley.<br />
<br />
When beta testers log into the WoW Classic Beta at that time, please look for the new Field of Strife realm. Alterac Valley will only be available for testing on this realm, and we will be turn off the other beta realms for the duration of the AV test. You’ll find that test characters on Field of Strife are confined to their capital cities. Don’t worry—even if you could leave the city, there will be no enemies, quest-givers, dungeons, or transports throughout the rest of the world.<br />
<br />
On the Field of Strife realm, when you create a character, it will be locked at level 58 for AV testing. These test characters will have appropriate gear, some gold, a mount, and access to class trainers and reagent vendors, but they will not be able to level up past 58.<br />
<br />
Please go to your city’s Battlemasters and queue for Alterac Valley as much as you like, and submit your feedback in our dedicated Alterac Valley feedback thread.<br />
<br />
We expect to close the realm and this AV test on Monday, June 17 at about 10:00 a.m PDT. At that time, the other beta realms will return.<br />
<br />
Thank you!</div></div><hr />

There is so much in vanilla AV that wasn’t ever used again from a strategy standpoint. So much that could be glitched, exploited etc Of course wait until people start complaining about cave/starting location and 18 hour matches.<br />

<br />
From what I understand all the pvp'ers leveled horde so it's just premade group's on horde so nobody on alliance side is going into the queue cause it's pointless which is why nobody is doing BG's on the beta. With premade 58's maybe that won't be an issue for this test.</div></div><hr />

It's because they have such a small pool of beta testers for Classic. Wish they would increase it some... but I really don't think that is going to happen.<br />
<br />
Very interesting that they are making premades at 58. Sounds like we may not see a level cap of 60 after all. Maybe 40 is it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean these are two separate teams. The classic team isn’t the live team. They’re also fixing quite a bit in 8.2. It’s not nearly enough imo but the fixes do point in the right direction (benthic gear being a way to upgrade/get gear with no RNG, essences being obtained with no RNG, not having to regrind traits on Azerite Armor, etc). Again, it doesn’t fix the huge issues with the game but it fixes most of the huge issues with BfA imo. Warfronts/islands and a lot of classes are still in a bad spot though.<br />
<br />
Either way, AV testing will be interesting but not as interesting the really really long AVs. Still hyped to see it though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How do you come to that conclusion? Its Only about testing AV.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MiiiMiii</div><div class="date">2019-06-13, 08:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So they are really doing it. This is the last thing they have to test after a big rewrite in comparison to Retail. All that remains is dungeons and raids, and those, so far in beta, have worked as expected.<br />
<br />
This means they won't increase cap any more than the current 40. <br />
<br />
I also think it could mean they will shut down beta once 8.2 releases to generate more hype for it. Or, more correctly, any hype at all.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Monster Hunter</div><div class="date">2019-06-13, 09:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">therealbowser in relation to the thread a few days ago and why classic AV will be a 10-30min rush, because in 1.12 thats what it became.<br />
Misuteri its post the complaints and nurfs<br />
Kreo<br />
<br />
3 days to test vanilla AV? That's like 1 or 2 match.<br />
<br />
not by 1.12 <br />
changes of note :<br />
<br />
The minimum number of players required to start a battle in Alterac Valley has been lowered to 20 (the maximum is still 40).<br />
Several terrain changes were made to fix some geometry exploits as well as to adjust for the new graveyard mechanic.<br />
NPC difficulty has been scaled down. All NPCs have had their power reduced by 15-30%.<br />
<br />
Most of the NPC guard units have been removed.<br />
Players now drop more quest items.<br />
Creatures that remain in Alterac Valley have had their hit points reduced.<br />
<br />
Korrak the Bloodrager and his band of trolls have packed up their bags and left Alterac Valley for greener pastures.<br />
<br />
by patch 1.12 a lot of the road bumbs to the boss zerg tactic were gone, though games could still go back to the grinding war they used to be it was only because of some canny defending <br />
<br />
from the wow wiki <br />
<br />
<br />
In Patch 1.11, the number of NPCs was severely reduced. On some servers, this has led to a strategy that is known as &quot;the race&quot; or &quot;the zerg&quot;. In this strategy, both sides bypass the main enemy group and rush the graveyard nearest the enemy base, quickly clear the two bunkers in the base, pull the Marshals, and then pull the General. Each side may also kill the opposing captain and claim a mine or easy Graveyard on the way, but the goal is still to rush the General without directly engaging players of the opposing faction. This leads to a faster-paced game which can be easily won or easily lost, providing more honor per hour than protracted games with the same win rate. <br />
<br />
<br />
so max most AV games will take 30mins to and hr<br />
<br />
it wouldn't be till TBC patch 2.4.0 that av would be fixed ish with <br />
Major buffs have been applied to Warmasters and Marshalls; Warmasters and Marshalls now increase each other's maximum health and maximum damage by 25%. This is a stacking buff. <br />
<br />
so the AV between 1.12 and 2.4.0 is possibly the fastest version of av even compared to today as you didn't even need to capture the towers, bye the time most people were rocking solid end game gear AV and before TBC AV was a 10-20min affair that was simply run down to the bottom cap the GY then pull and aoe down the boss and marshals.</div></div><hr />

That sucks. If its all correct, I hope after beta test there will be shitstorm demanding to bring AV back to previous patch or apply other changes. Rushing tactic is not fun at all.</div></div><hr />

im assuming its correct as i just copy pasted the archived patch notes. if the wow we get is 1.12 as it was then thats the version of AV we get. unless they change it.</div></div><hr />

Why is that nuts? Beta is there for their testing and not your personal smooth and uninterrupted enjoyment.<br />
<br />
And for AV it is really a good idea to shut down the other servers if you want enough people to participate.</div></div><hr />

It's still infinitely better than live. It may not be perfect, but I'll take what I can get.<br />
