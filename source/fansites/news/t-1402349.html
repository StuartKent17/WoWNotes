Blizzcon Dev Interview<br />
PlayersCut had the chance to speak with (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GgsF-5BVaE) Chris Metzen at Blizzcon. <br />
<br />
The Emerald Dream and Warcraft 4<br />
<br />
The Emerald Dream is a nice idea and the team has talked about making it into an expansion many times. Building an entire expansion worth of zones around a green lush forest theme would get very boring, so the Emerald Dream would be better used as raid, dungeon, or a subzone, not an entire expansion.<br />
For the foreseeable future, the content in World of Warcraft is where the team's primary focus will be. Warcraft 4 isn't planned right now, as Starcraft 2 is where the RTS focus is.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warcraft Movie<br />
<br />
The Warcraft movie is still doing casting. <br />
The Orc's corruption by the Burning Legion is a root theme of the movie story.<br />
<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft Heroes and Villains<br />
<br />
The first few WoW expansions burned through the Warcraft villains pretty fast, which is why the team introduced characters like Garrosh. There are a number of characters they have started to insert into the storyline with the hopes that they will be made into compelling characters or great villains in the future. <br />
Wrathion and Anduin are characters to watch going forward. Anduin gets slightly older with every model update and Metzen would like to see him become king one day.<br />
Yrel is a new character in Warlords of Draenor, starting as a naive priestess in old Draenor. When the conflict kicks into gear she will need to become a hero over the course of the story, a new major Alliance heroine, and take a leadership role among the Alliance. <br />

Raid Finder<br />
I am probably in the minority but just wanted to say anyway.<br />
I really don't think you are. We can see by the numbers that it's a popular feature. As is the way with most things, if you're fine with something you're unlikely to make a thread about it—so thank you for going to the trouble.<br />
<br />
Having said that, people do have valid issues with game features from time to time, and we make sure to pass on that feedback to the developers so they can decide whether to make any adjustments, and hopefully improve the game experience for everyone. We've made a number of tweaks to LFR since it was introduced based on your feedback, so also a big thanks to those who have highlighted other aspects.<br />
<br />
Basically, we really appreciate good or bad feedback about LFR or any other game features, as long as it's constructive! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/281091-will-prob-be-flamed-but-i-like-lfr/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8715512535?page=1#13))<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Warlords of Draenor Flying<br />
small no-fly zones are ok, the whole continent is way to punishing. Especially without lore reason.<br />
I don't feel the need to justify good gameplay with lore. Why can Four Winds virmen defeat Onyxia? Good gameplay. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402556616085495808))<br />
Believable lore and setting, must be internally consistent, is very important to a RPG.<br />
We agree, but gameplay is more important, at least at Blizzard. Other studios design with different values. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402650714209394688))<br />
<br />
So basically not having flying has nothing to do with immersion or exploration or interaction it's just timesink<br />
That's almost exactly the opposite of what we said, but I know you like to argue. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/401044360315142144))<br />
it is when we are forced us to fight mobs not needed wasting my now-slim play-time ...please reconsider<br />
But that sounds like you're arguing for a dungeon with 3 bosses in the first room.... (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402542362313764864))<br />
nope cus dungeons have a path and story ...trash has to do with dungeon and since Cata they hint next boss mechanics<br />
Yet players still complain constantly about trash because it delays them from getting to the good stuff. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402559068994170880))<br />
<br />
I don't want leveling to be easier/quicker. I want repeated content to have less travel/downtime.<br />
We don't think flying makes questing quicker. We think it makes it trivial. There is a difference. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402557617844658176))<br />
<br />
You guys always talk about player &quot;choice&quot; yet you enforce this issue of no flying. Double standards :|<br />
Actually, we champion interesting decisions. Deciding whether to fly or not is not interesting, b/c flying is always better. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402547220274085888))<br />
You will take away whole playstyles. &quot;Fly around and herb + chatting in guild&quot; is not who I want to gamequit.<br />
Those will still exist. Just not at day one on the new continent. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402557435212070912))<br />
<br />
&quot;This thing I openly admit is not fun or compelling is valuable&quot; is, you understand, a hard sell?<br />
Game design, like much of art, isn't about having an intense experience 100% of the time. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402544941546496000))<br />
You need a background upon which the epic stuff can stand against. Travel, easy fights, repairs are all part of the experience. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402545313325391872))<br />
In the near term you might not miss them if they were gone, but in the long term, the game might feel like it had less depth. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402545416291368963))<br />
<br />
Lorewise, what's the reason we can't fly then suddenly, we can... then we can't again?<br />
There isn't a good one. It's not a lore-based decision. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402544641238523905))<br />
<br />
if thats true then why do you nerf quest xp, RAF, heirlooms etc to make the grind faster?<br />
Because otherwise hitting max level would only take more and more time the longer the game had been out. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402543724640485376))<br />
It does NOT mean that we think leveling in a new continent is lame and shouldn't be part of the game. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402543874289070080))<br />
<br />
why can't you just give mobs a close range dismount ability? So we can still fly high, but not low to skip mobs?<br />
Ultimately, you are still deciding when you want to face danger in the outdoor world. That's not quite the same thing. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402540537355304960))<br />
<br />
Also, If WoW's an escape from the drudgery of the real world, how are boring commutes until 6.1 making the game more fun?<br />
Is clearing trash a ton of fun? Some things are in the game to provide pacing and cadence. You can't be at 11 all the time. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402539300174061568))<br />
<br />
That could easily be fixed by adding some &quot;anti-air units&quot; around some quest areas, where it could work anyways.<br />
That either means quest flying is possible but super risky or it's realistically not possible. Either way not much of a difference (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402535536985784320))<br />
<br />
What was wrong with the Wrath model of grounded leveling for main, BoA tome for alts?<br />
If leveling is supposed to be trivial for alts, why not just make them all jump to max level? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402533984887767040))<br />
<br />
A question: Will the PvP-Zone be a &quot;No-Fly-Zone&quot; even after 6.1 when we get our flying-ability back?<br />
Almost certainly. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402532946835300352))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
Are we getting cinematic WOD trailer?<br />
Of course. No ETA. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402540658256125952))<br />
<br />
Any news on the *clean-up of karazan* stuff being related to pre-expac event ?<br />
Like much of what is data-mined, I would wait for an official announcement before freaking out (pro or con). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402536635037806592))<br />

would be cool to see her end up stranded here at the end of the expansion, kind of like a reverse us, would be interesting to have her not come to our timeline willingly, would make good character development for her</div></div><hr />

<br />
At Blizzcon 2011 they were wondering if people did actually like other worlds away from Azeroth. They said they weren't fans of it either. All the while WoD was already planned.<br />
<br />
They never give any hints at all for their next expansions. They may already have an ED expansion but they won't say and even try to mislead us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I don't get the Emerald Dream thing. I mean...hey...it's up to Blizz what they make out of that forest. Doesn't have to look all the same, does it? And I didn't find the pandaria landscape changing all THAT much from area to area...and I don't need a rock-area in every expansion cause that is usually the area I visually hate the most(and by chance always has teh suckiest quests).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sounds like you wouldn't care ''what'' the Emerald Dream was, as long as somewhere on the Box Art it said '&quot;Emerald Dream''.<br />
<br />
Pretty sure they aren't going to compromise the entire concept just for a namesake, when they can make something entirely new instead without remaking (breaking)a popular idea.</div></div><hr />

Only, they don't even put THAT much effort into it. It's just a one or two line, &quot;f you, you're wrong and stupid&quot; in a few more words. So condescending!</div></div><hr />

<br />
You and me both. Blizzard can make it a raid or a subzone. Dungeon would be too small. Give it as much as possible but not too much. Get it just right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't be fooled; spoiled brats whining about &quot;flying ruining the game&quot; is the entire reason their trying this little timesink experiment in the first place.<br />
<br />
<br />
So you just need to fight whining with whining. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Icecrown Glacier and Storm Peaks REQUIRED flying to get around in, and they're both regarded as exceptional zones. <br />
<br />
You could NEVER achieve what those two zones achieved by having players travel around on foot. The grand vistas of Ulduar, the carpet of zombies that seethed through Icecrown, the towering mountains... all of those things were possible because FLYING was taken into account while making them. Kun'lai would have benefited greatly by designing its northern reaches with flying in mind; having the entire area traversable by foot makes it feel decidedly smaller and less epic in scale because they had to MAKE it that way. <br />
<br />
<br />
And if blizzard is designing zones that &quot;don't ever require flying,&quot; then you really aren't going to see zones like Storm Peaks or Icecrown anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
100% correct. The Lich King (Arthas Menethil) was a big impact and we had our moments when we took him down. We kill and move on, got a lot more to see such as Kil'jaeden, Azshara, Sargeras, and the Dreadlords.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't bother. People like this are the ones that will be the first ones whining when they hit 100 and can't fly around to seek out low levels to gank. They won't want to fly to actually enjoy the scenery and get a whole new feel for the world. They'll just want to fly to make other people miserable because they live to be argumentative little keyboard bullies.<br />

When xpacs come out I take 5-6 days to level up to maximum level, doing all the quests available in a zone to enjoy and appreciate the leveling experience and zones that blizz took time into creating. I would really hate blazing through that because, i rly know, if flying was available since day 1, even though I like the slow leveling up, I will use flying.

are you serious right now? the latest examples are Daily grinds and MoP Reputations, where they didnt give in at first, because they thought it was the best thing since sliced bread... and then their resolve crumbled by 5.2, because people couldnt give two hoots about massive timesinks and forced grinds. The big picture here is, they want us to spend more time playing the game for the same or less rewards than before and people arent gonna take it lightly, just like the MoP fiasco, the end.</div></div><hr />

Appreciate it on your own time.

did you read their answers? they didnt actually give a good reason beyond &quot;quiesting is trivial,&quot; which is mostly nonissue, if there are no heirlooom books and flying is restricted to max level. they just used slippery slopes with 3 bosses in one room and no trash ever BS answers. They arent creative enough to make people want to stay on the ground, so they just prohibit flying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Icecrown Glacier and Storm Peaks REQUIRED flying to get around in, and they're both regarded as exceptional zones. <br />
<br />
You could NEVER achieve what those two zones achieved by having players travel around on foot. The grand vistas of Ulduar, the carpet of zombies that seethed through Icecrown, the towering mountains... all of those things were possible because FLYING was taken into account while making them. Kun'lai would have benefited greatly by designing its northern reaches with flying in mind; having the entire area traversable by foot makes it feel decidedly smaller and less epic in scale because they had to MAKE it that way. <br />
<br />
<br />
And if blizzard is designing zones that &quot;don't ever require flying,&quot; then you really aren't going to see zones like Storm Peaks or Icecrown anymore.<br />
<br />
i love flying but at the same time i also thinks it did infact ruin the game abit since it removes the majority of the challanges when questing like how it was during vanilla, like hole outland, just fly in do the quest and fly out and skipping 95% of the mobs since you dont have to fight them to reach ur objective.<br />
MoP bin great that way and i for one dont mind waiting till 6.1 to be able to fly again, and i have 10 lvl 90 on my main server and loads of alts on other realms and still rather see the content from the ground up than from above :P</div></div><hr />

I don't want anyone to do anything I want to do nor do I care tbh, I just enjoy slow leveling because I don't do alts and i only play with 1 char, so questing is still something fresh to me every xpac, and I actually enjoyed the beautiful scenery that pandaria is, and I don't think the questing and art content done by designers should go unnoticeable at rocket speed.

<br />
so you dont like, how 60-70 leveling zone is done faster with flyier? jesus christ, a compelling reason to not give us flying at max level! you DO know flying wasnt available till 70 (68 for druids) when tBC was around, right? you DO know, that the reason whe can fly since 60 in outland, is because they are making leveling globally faster, right? like mounts at 20, fast at 40 etc? <br />
<br />
and the quoted poster is correct, storm peaks was one of the most amazing zones ever (and unlike vashir, was a pleasure to quest in for most people), we will never see that kind of zone again, if they design everything like hellfire<br />

So they know that some players won't join at the start because of &quot;no-flying&quot;.<br />
<br />
This just proves further that they won't give in to whiners.<br />
<br />
They always make dumbass decisions at the start of the expansions and become all stubborn and tell us to suck it up and write blogs telling us to l2play and when they see the sub numbers floating away they do a 180 and start saying in interviews that they regret it and that it was a bad decision. This will be no different.<br />

<br />
Outland is a nice idea and the team has talked about making it into an expansion many times. Building an entire expansion worth of zones around a demon invaded hellscape theme would get very boring, so Outland would be better used as raid, dungeon, or a subzone, not an entire expansion.<br />
<br />
Northrend is a nice idea and the team has talked about making it into an expansion many times. Building an entire expansion worth of zones around a frozen wasteland theme would get very boring, so Northrend would be better used as raid, dungeon, or a subzone, not an entire expansion.<br />
<br />
A Cataclysm is a nice idea and the team has talked about making it into an expansion many times. Building an entire expansion worth of zones around a fire and lava theme would get very boring, so the Cataclysm would be better used as raid, dungeon, or a subzone, not an entire expansion.<br />
<br />
Pandaria is a nice idea and the team has talked about making it into an expansion many times. Building an entire expansion worth of zones around a green lush forest theme would get very boring, so Pandaria would be better used as raid, dungeon, or a subzone, not an entire expansion.<br />
<br />
I mean seriously, just as Northrend had multiple unique snowy zones, The ED could have multiple green forest zones. Ideas I have come up with:<br />
&gt;Your classic green forest, swathed in glimmering mist<br />
&gt;A jungle with geothermal activity - hot springs and volcanoes.<br />
&gt;Fields of trippy, dream twisted landscape like this: http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20081001002014/wowwiki/images/3/3e/Emeralddream.jpg<br />
&gt; A heavily Nightmare corrupted area<br />
&gt; A Worgen infested scrubland<br />
&gt; Mountain forests<br />
&gt; A Mountain Giant as an entire zone.<br />
&gt; A charred glade which has been burnt out by the locals in an attempt to curb the Nightmare's corruption.<br />
&gt;A rushing river network.<br />
&gt;A lush archipalgo.<br />
<br />
They could do anything they wanted, it's literally a land made of dreams - how much creative freedom can you want?</div></div><hr />

<br />
A combination of Molten Front and Firelands ..... that would be a good solution for Emerald Dream. The &quot;Molten Front&quot; styled like Isle of Thunder/Timless Isle where we can hunt rars maybe world bosses and do some quests and/or unlock some subzones. And in this &quot;Molten Front&quot; part is the entrance to the Emerald Dream raid.</div></div><hr />

I agree with the first part of your post. Its the 'flying ruins the game' crowd that spoils everything.<br />
<br />
However, I think blizz will take a a different approach with some WoD zones. Why? not just to artificially slow leveling, but also to gate some additional content exclusive to flying which will already be in the game. For example, we could have some quest hubs in Spires of Arak (Arakkoa settlements atop trees/hills similar to Skettis in TBC) which are there at launch, but will be accessible after 6.1. There are 2 advantages to this:<br />
1. A greater sense of immersion/mystery<br />
2. 'New' content for the 6.1 patch, allowing devs to focus on other things for that patch or fix bugs in these quests themselves early. <br />
<br />
Well, I will will be sorely disappointed if there are no additional areas in WoD zones accessible only after unlocking flight in old Draenor.<br />
<br />
Slightly Offtopic, I never liked storm peaks that much so how good zones were is subjective; Icecrown still had that dark atmosphere so it was better to me; and personally i find traversing mountains on foot (Kun-Lai/Howling Fjord) more epic in terms of the questing experience than flying over tons of mountains just because.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Almost entirely disagree. Icecrown was a dreadful waste of a zone. The only good part was the Argent Tournament. Only reason I, and a lot of other people, went to the zone (apart from the Icecrown Citadel). Stupid waste of space. &quot;...the carpet of zombies&quot; posed literally NO threat. They just stood there, and really made the Scourge look like the most useless threat.<br />
<br />
Storm Peaks was a pretty average zone. All I remember was 1 quest chain and Ulduar. Was pretty meh. I don't know why you are supporting these zones, whenever I hear people talk about amazing Northrend zones, I always hear Grizzly Hills, which had nothing to do with flying, and was an amazing zone. Personally, the sense of wonder walking on my mount through the Howling Fjord and Scholazar Basin was one of the most immersive experiences I have had in WoW. I am going through Howling Fjord again now on my Hunter, with flying... and it is definitely not the same. Nowhere NEAR as exciting. Now, yes, this is partially attributed to the fact I have done it before. However, I can tell you, the flying aspect does also help diminish the immersion.<br />
<br />
Outlands also had places such as Nagrand, a massive favourite throughout the player base. It had a lot of ground content, but also a bit of content restricted to flying, same with Terrokar Forest and Shadowmoon Valley. This is how I think zones should be, and how I believe they will make Draenor. Do you think, just because flying is restricted to 6.1, that flying-compulsory content won't exist? Really? Blizzard is not that dry.<br />
<br />
Plus, don't forget we still have that island that ended up becoming Netherstorm, which will become available once/after flying is available. Who says that wont encapsulate your little flying fantasy zones like Storm Peaks and Icecrown?<br />

This is what I wanted to say pretty much, well done. :p The Spires of Arak will have TONNES of flying-restricted content, that is bound to make 6.1 more exciting. Definitely a zone I am excited to explore. I am sure it will feel like a completely different experience before and after 6.1. People who are whining about their decision aren't seeing the possibilities. They just want to rush to 100 and raid. Whilst the end-game is where a lot of the main content is focused, the leveling experience in every new expansion also bring a lot of good content too, that people skip and miss out on, and then complain that Blizzard did not make enough content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was literally carpeted with elites in some areas. The entire place was rife with scourge. The massive battlements, tiered buildings; nothing they've made sense has come close to that level of building up the final bad guy. <br />
<br />
<br />
Storm Peaks was a pretty average zone. All I remember was 1 quest chain and Ulduar. Was pretty meh.<br />
<br />
You can't beat Storm Peak's scenery or Ambiance. It was an exceptional zone. And I spent three months straight sitting in it waiting for the Time Lost proto drake, and I STILL think it's a great zone. <br />
<br />
I certainly wouldn't have felt that way flying in circles around Shadowmoon or Nagrand. I started to hate shadowmoon valley flying across it to do the Netherwing quests. <br />
<br />
<br />
I don't know why you are supporting these zones,<br />
<br />
Look at the poll on the forum for &quot;best max level zone;&quot; it's BY and FAR Icecrown, with many people saying Storm Peaks would have been their choice had it been listed. <br />
<br />
<br />
whenever I hear people talk about amazing Northrend zones, I always hear Grizzly Hills, which had nothing to do with flying, and was an amazing zone.<br />
<br />
Sure, Grizzly Hills was great.<br />
<br />
And you know what? Grizzly hills isn't somehow &quot;ruined&quot; by seeing it from the air. Flying through the trees and along the cliffs makes it all the more breathtaking.<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally, the sense of wonder walking on my mount through the Howling Fjord and Scholazar Basin was one of the most immersive experiences I have had in WoW. I am going through Howling Fjord again now on my Hunter, with flying... and it is definitely not the same. Nowhere NEAR as exciting. Now, yes, this is partially attributed to the fact I have done it before. However, I can tell you, the flying aspect does also help diminish the immersion. Howling Fjord was incredibly difficult to get around in without flying. <br />
<br />
As for Sholazar, you were pretty much expected to get flying halfway through the zone. And again, NEITHER howling fjord or Sholazar are &quot;ruined&quot; by flying.<br />
<br />
You know what zones are ACTUALLY ruined when you get to fly in them? The ones that were never DESIGNED for flying, because they aren't actually impressive from the air. Like Townlong Steppes, or most of Dread Wastes. They're flat and boring both on the ground and by air. <br />
<br />
<br />
Outlands also had places such as Nagrand, a massive favourite throughout the player base. It had a lot of ground content, but also a bit of content restricted to flying, same with Terrokar Forest and Shadowmoon Valley. This is how I think zones should be, and how I believe they will make Draenor. <br />
<br />
Nagrand was a pretty bad zone, not going to lie. It was full of Ogres (oh gee that's new.) Questing was a dreadful experience; the entire zone was VERY flat and it was dominated by the quest chain of &quot;kill 20 of this animal, NOW go kill 20 of this animal, AND NOW go kill 20 of THIS animal&quot; and other fairly inconsequential quests.<br />
<br />
Terrokar was okay, but frankly, it fell flat of being anything &quot;alien.&quot; Wolves, spiders, moths. Gee, Alien to the extreme, right? <br />
<br />
Frankly, most of Outland was pretty weak. <br />
<br />
<br />
Do you think, just because flying is restricted to 6.1, that flying-compulsory content won't exist? Really? Blizzard is not that dry.<br />
<br />
So it just sits there for an entire patch cycle? How fun. <br />
<br />
<br />
Plus, don't forget we still have that island that ended up becoming Netherstorm, which will become available once/after flying is available. Who says that wont encapsulate your little flying fantasy zones like Storm Peaks and Icecrown?<br />

The Emerald Dream is not just &quot;one big forest&quot;, it's the original blueprints for Azeroth. We associate it with forestry and nature because druids, particularly night elves, flock to it, not because it has to be some evergreen haven, and it's not. The Emerald Nightmare put a stop to most of that, at the very least.<br />
<br />
I can't tell if this is Blizzard's idea of &quot;creativity&quot; or if they're just being willfully ignorant. All their expansions reuse themes, to some degree, and yet they don't repeat the same concept a million different times. Northrend is described as a frozen continent, yet it has tundras and fjords that aren't beholden to the frozen wasteland stereotype. Cataclysm didn't just show us remnants of a scarred world, it shows us further scarring from barren wastelands and barren wastelands evolving into lush rivers and forests.<br />
<br />
This concept that Emerald Dream has to be a forest is the biggest load of bollocks that Blizzard's ever vomited, well, with the exception of a few others, perhaps. It's just downright insulting, not to their fans but to their own designers. Do they think their art team is that unoriginal? If so, perhaps you should look for some new ones, then.<br />
<br />
As for no flight? I'm on the fence for that one. Outside pacing I see no point. Leveling is not dictated by how fast we can fly because we have always required reaching the level cap before we can fly anyway, so in mind, that leaves the idea that it's for &quot;exploration&quot; purposes. That alone is a crock of shit. Exploration is not governed by whether one can fly or not, it's governed by risk vs. reward. Why take the time to explore when players get rewarded more for simply standing in Stormwind or Orgrimmar? Flight or no flight doesn't change that, the lack of it simply makes it less convenient on players when they do head off to do something.<br />
<br />
From a lore perspective it makes no sense and from an end-game gameplay perspective it still makes no sense. Unless they've given much thought to the problem of exploration-based rewards then why bother? At least in games like Guild Wars 2 exploration makes sense, you get more than a mere achievement for exploring an entire zone, and so the lack of flight is encouraging, but on Warcraft you get absolutely nothing but a waste of time and one, meaningless achievement.<br />
<br />
So in short, the problems aren't with flight but with the lack of a reward for exploration. Either fix exploration or don't bother restricting us, because otherwise it's just a major timesink for no tangible gain. I'm still going to sit in a random city somewhere, because why bother riding out past hundreds of mobs for one achievement?</div></div><hr />

<br />
or why not make an expansion where there emerald dream is just one of the zones.. ala Vash. What he is saying and what you are saying are basically the same thing. If the subzones you want inside the emerald dream are not a green forest, then why do they have to be ´inside´ the dream. it is like saying I want an entire expansion inside Vash.. but I want 5 of the zones to not be underwater.<br />
<br />
it is either going to be like the molton front, or like firelands itself.. probably both.<br />

<br />
<br />
are you serious right now? the latest examples are Daily grinds and MoP Reputations, where they didnt give in at first, because they thought it was the best thing since sliced bread... and then their resolve crumbled by 5.2, because people couldnt give two hoots about massive timesinks and forced grinds. The big picture here is, they want us to spend more time playing the game for the same or less rewards than before and people arent gonna take it lightly, just like the MoP fiasco, the end.<br />
<br />
It was all relative. People complained so much in Cata about there being no solo content so the devs overcompensated with 5.0 content. Afterwards they realized how alt-unfriendly it was so, yes, 6 months later they nerfed old stuff.<br />
<br />
There is a fine line between calling something a time sink and saying there is not enough to do.</div></div><hr />

I completely agree with no flying till 6.1 but to say that the lore is not important for good gameplay can brake the stupid-meter. Then maybe they can add mounts like lamborghinies and ferarri in the game it would be cool dropping lamborghini from boss and driving in Nagrand with 400 % of speed .. who cares bout the lore :D</div></div><hr />

I don't particularly care about &quot;no flying&quot; while leveling (though, as I've said, I think it worked out pretty well with zone design in WotLK,) but at max level, it's just a pain. ESPECIALLY for an entire continent.</div></div><hr />

This is just pathetic...Blizz are no better than anyone on any forum anywhere that take things to extremes to make a point during an argument.<br />
<br />
<br />
why can't you just give mobs a close range dismount ability? So we can still fly high, but not low to skip mobs?<br />
Ultimately, you are still deciding when you want to face danger in the outdoor world. That's not quite the same thing.<br />
<br />
They are also highly ignorant or deliberately ignoring the facts about mobs...there is NO danger WHATSOEVER in the outdoor world, mobs are nothing but slowdowns.<br />
<br />
The fact is, they don't like the fact that we use flying mounts to make max-level farming/grinding/dailies much faster/more efficient, and they want to remove that. I can think of a hundred things they could do to slow us down even more though, and I'm surprised they haven't introduced any of them yet.</div></div><hr />

Personally I like it. I find it 100% necessary and warranted considering the customer base. These aren't middle aged gentlemen out buying a new TV they are dealing with. Its mostly just people who whine/rage at anything and everything, and barely make the effort to type out a post that makes sense or has correct spelling.<br />

Icecrown Glacier and Storm Peaks REQUIRED flying to get around in, and they're both regarded as exceptional zones. <br />
<br />
You could NEVER achieve what those two zones achieved by having players travel around on foot. The grand vistas of Ulduar, the carpet of zombies that seethed through Icecrown, the towering mountains... all of those things were possible because FLYING was taken into account while making them. Kun'lai would have benefited greatly by designing its northern reaches with flying in mind; having the entire area traversable by foot makes it feel decidedly smaller and less epic in scale because they had to MAKE it that way. <br />
<br />
<br />
And if blizzard is designing zones that &quot;don't ever require flying,&quot; then you really aren't going to see zones like Storm Peaks or Icecrown anymore.<br />
<br />
Storm Peaks required flying for only a few quests. You could get around a large portion of Icecrown as well. Either way, they could have easily made FP's or ports for those quests. Plenty of zones in this game were made pre flying, and without flying in mind. Blades Edge? Ferelas?<br />
<br />
I've also never heard Icecrown and Storm Peaks called exceptional. Regardless, ports and FPs make flying not necessary there. Ulduar wasn't even a questing zone. Also, Blizzard has stated dislike for flying mounts, and never stated they are caving to the &quot;no flyers&quot; whines..</div></div><hr />

*he raised his hand and stood, walking forward a few steps and approaching the squabbling circle of admired elders and younglings.* <br />
It's true and ultimately very sad. Wrath of the Lich King was the first expansion I played and it felt epic, logging in for the first time into the World. Leveling up actually felt like it meant something. Now, like you said, everything is on a much smaller scale and they force &quot;no flying&quot;... like sure, things may be more fun for a little bit, but no one, absolutely no one, enjoys daily grinds without flying mounts. *glares at Isle of Thunder and Timeless Isles.* It would be awesome to revisit Northrend next, as it's been 2 years since we've been in touch with the Scourge and I wonder how Lord Bolvar is doing now that he's taken over. Is everything frostfire now? Or is it still ice? *he shrugged and returned to his seat, he had nothing else to say for the moment.*</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can't beat Storm Peak's scenery or Ambiance. It was an exceptional zone. And I spent three months straight sitting in it waiting for the Time Lost proto drake, and I STILL think it's a great zone. <br />
<br />
I certainly wouldn't have felt that way flying in circles around Shadowmoon or Nagrand. I started to hate shadowmoon valley flying across it to do the Netherwing quests. <br />
<br />
<br />
Well, most of Icecrown was a waste. The huge path of elites/zombies had only one quest chain involving them if one at all. ALL the other quests were on the outside of the zone. The FP, The Tourney, the two spires, and two Vrykul areas.. and the UD crafting area.. thats about it. The seething zombies did almost nothing but divide the zone.<br />
<br />
As far as Northrend, Dragonblight was much better. Good story, HUGE BATTLES RAGING, Naxx, ruined keeps and villages, dragon shrines...<br />
<br />
I'm also not sure why you hated SMV. So much lore there. BT, The volcano, lava, elementals, INfernals assaulting Horde and Alliance, ghost riders, ghosts, demons, dragons..</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry, but what Icecrown and Storm Peaks are YOU remembering?<br />
<br />
You literally could not progress past perhaps the first five or 10 quests in EITHER zone without flying. This wasn't a matter of finding some hard-to-find road, this was legitimately a sheer insurmountable cliff blocking the way. <br />
<br />
Icecrown? Maybe you could have run along the trackless snow wastes that flanked the zone for a bit on either side, but those weren't anywhere near the actual quests.<br />
<br />
<br />
Add in a few flight paths? Again, you clearly do not remember the zones very well. There were giant hills where you'd go for one set of quests (Harpy hill in storm peaks, for example.) There were no roads up there. <br />
<br />
And you know what? The zone was still great. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, in what world is blade's edge mountain a good example of... anything? That place has the dubious honor of being both a pain in the ass to traverse on land AND by air.</div></div><hr />

Well I know that you can't get to the harpy area on foot, can't get to the alliance FP on foot, can't actually go BETWEEN the zones on foot (Engine of the makers is completely walled off by mountains,) can't get from the bottom of the ZONE to any of the higher areas on foot, can't get across to Ulduar on foot, can't get over to the storm giant/vrykul area on foot, which itself is completely seperated from the questing/southern Ulduar complex... <br />
<br />
If you wanted to get super technical, the entire zone is roughly broken into five or so giant subregions that can't be accessed from one another, and are extremely mountainous AND spread out within themselves, and a myriad of questing areas up on the tops of cliffs that are inaccessible from any of the points on the ground. <br />

The central Vrykul area you could walk to. Look at the Icecrown map, the dark blue is almost nothing. Only a few quests require you to go there. The majority of quests are on the outsides of the zones, most of which you can walk to on foot.<br />
<br />
Dragonblight also had valleys, and mountains. Underground caves, shores, cities, keeps and etc. Massive Mountains =/=always good zone. BEM would be an amazing zone with that logic.<br />
<br />
I also doubt your knowledge of the lore, as its very very very very limited I guess. <br />

<br />
It'd be exceptionally inefficient to traverse Icecrown on foot. Most of the time you'd be running along the edges... you'd basically have to hook all the way around from the east flank of the glacier, all the way to one of the wrathgates to even cross into the interior.<br />
<br />
Yeah, maybe it's just me talking, but that would be god awful to do on foot. <br />
<br />
As for the Vrykul town in the center... yeah, you can get to it, IF you somehow get yourself on to the glacier, run for a good long while through hordes of enemies, and THEN make it where you want to go...<br />
<br />
But I'm guessing people view the prospect of doing things like that every day as &quot;engaging&quot; and &quot;a good use of time,&quot; so go figure. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lemonpartyfan</div><div class="date">2013-11-21, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I know that you can't get to the harpy area on foot, can't get to the alliance FP on foot, can't actually go BETWEEN the zones on foot (Engine of the makers is completely walled off by mountains,) can't get from the bottom of the ZONE to any of the higher areas on foot, can't get across to Ulduar on foot, can't get over to the storm giant/vrykul area on foot, which itself is completely seperated from the questing/southern Ulduar complex... <br />
<br />
If you wanted to get super technical, the entire zone is roughly broken into five or so giant subregions that can't be accessed from one another, and are extremely mountainous AND spread out within themselves, and a myriad of questing areas up on the tops of cliffs that are inaccessible from any of the points on the ground. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Icecrown was very much full of trackless snow wastes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blade's edge &quot;mountains?&quot; More like &quot;blade's edge plateaus.&quot; It was little chunks of flat land striated up and down some hills that were roughly connected into something about black dragons and ogres. <br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but from almost every point, blade's edge was a pretty crappy zone. When the best thing about it is that &quot;it has some cool raptor NPCs,&quot; that's not saying much.<br />
<br />
Again, go back and try.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
It'd be exceptionally inefficient to traverse Icecrown on foot. Most of the time you'd be running along the edges... you'd basically have to hook all the way around from the east flank of the glacier, all the way to one of the wrathgates to even cross into the interior.<br />
<br />
Yeah, maybe it's just me talking, but that would be god awful to do on foot. <br />
<br />
As for the Vrykul town in the center... yeah, you can get to it, IF you somehow get yourself on to the glacier, run for a good long while through hordes of enemies, and THEN make it where you want to go...<br />
<br />
But I'm guessing people view the prospect of doing things like that every day as &quot;engaging&quot; and &quot;a good use of time,&quot; so go figure. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blade's edge mountains was walls between relatively flat areas. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh I KNOW what happens. But they didn't actually say it in game. <br />
<br />
Good questing &quot;lore&quot; isn't in the &quot;well you have to go online to check it to see what it was all about!&quot; <br />

You are only posting opinions. Every zone is a flat area surrounded by mountains. The same goes for Icecrown. If you like blue land and snow over Draenei ruins, thats fine but it doesn't prove anything at all.<br />
<br />
Yes, they say it in the game. Now you are just lying to prove a point and that is despicable.</div></div><hr />

Well, unless you have a warlock summon, you're not getting to the upper level of Storm peaks from the base level. Period. <br />
<br />
I suppose you could feasibly meander your way around some places if you liked relying on slowfall so you didn't have to fall to your death everytime you wanted to go down a 400 foot sheer drop.<br />
<br />
Of course, you would have to have found your way up into regions you needed a flying mount to get to in the first place, and there'd be no way back without one, soooo....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As I said, I flew around storm peaks looking for the Time-lost proto-drake for three months back in WotLK. So it's no stretch of the imagination that I seem to know the zone better than you do.</div></div><hr />

Well first, you straight up CANNOT access the upper regions of storm peaks without a flying mount, period. <br />
<br />
Second, like I said, I flew around Stormpeaks for about three months awaiting the time-lost proto-drake. So it's no big stretch that I apparently know the zone better than you do. <br />
<br />
There are a FEW of the upper areas that have sheer 200 foot drops down to other areas... though they'd be entirely one way... and you need flying mounts to get UP to those initial areas anyway, so...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Frankly, Shadowmoon valley is very... sparse. It's not particularly grand outside of the hand of Gul'dan and Black temple. It's just some scattered ruins and glowing lava. <br />
<br />
Icecrown on the other hand... ignoring the things like the argent tournament, or the argent attack areas, or the scarlet onslaught, you have an ENTIRE ZONE basically built up as the grand fortress of one of the most powerful figures in warcraft history. He wasn't powing around in some ramshackle tents built on ruins like pertinere EVERYONE in Shadowmoon valley was doing. He had the fleshwerks, TWO Vrykul towns (one of which was basically a fortress complex unto its own right, production plants, ranging from saronite mines to necropolis construction, the various vaults built up into giant complexes flanking the glacier, a nerubian town, plague facilities built into the glacier, Sindragosa's fall, the wrathgates soldiered by gigantic undead elite and frostwyrms, necromancer keeps... all of that good stuff. <br />
<br />
The lich king meant some god damn business in what he did, and Icecrown reflected that. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, they say it in the game. Now you are just lying to prove a point and that is despicable.<br />
<br />
We were meant to assume Illidan was being uppity because he was the bad guy, and that the blood elves and naga were bad because they were with him. And then the burning legion is bad because they're the burning legion, and we gotta stop them. <br />
<br />
Oh and then toss in some arrakoa, a few shreds about Gul'dan, and Teron Gorefiend comes back so he can be stuck as a boss in black temple for no particular reason. <br />
<br />

No, of course you aren't... Either way, most of the lore is in the game. Read quest texts, read the in game books. Read the out of game books, play the RTS, read online. So much lore in Outlands. Again, its fine if you prefer other areas, but you are really just cherry picking here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There have always been max level quest chains. Some of them were almost required to raid. In BC, the best pre raid tanking weapon was from a long quest chain. I think it started at 69 or 70. The next tanking weapon drops like 75% through Kara, if my memory serves.</div></div><hr />

You guys are arguing about flying vs. non-flying when you don't even know on what blizzard is working on.<br />
If Blizzard decided to not allow flying until 6.1 then they must have deep reason behind this choice.<br />
Did you get access to a leaked version or something and played from 90 to 100 to say that flying / non-flying is bad / good?<br />

Not been funny but i get the feeling when we visit the new zones it will be just barren open wastelands with a few towers and buildings threw in...and trees.<br />
Didnt anyone get frustrated with Mop , i mean jade forest was like fuck yea, looks amazing very good work etc etc etc then you left the zone and it was like.....wtf is this shit just open land with a few trees and buildings apart from krasarang wilds or however it was spelt it was fucking lazy looking development time, almost as though they had spent there whole time designing jade forest then got bored run out of ideas and thought 'fuck it these will do, the novelty will wear of them after jade forest anyway'.<br />
it feel liek a bit of a trend with expansions...i cant see this one being any different.</div></div><hr />

There is no need to be sorry!<br />
<br />
As already explained by one of the blues, whipping in and out on your flying mount and only killing/looting something specific isn't the type of experience they want to create while levelling.<br />
<br />
And my self and a very large proportion of the community agree with this, ground based levelling creates a more vibrant experience for the players. Why would you want to detract that and just zerg rush to max level to complain there is nothing to do?<br />

at max level you are no longer leveling, with that in mind ill retry<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krohgar</div><div class="date">2013-11-21, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still can't get over the mindset. Before Blizzard announced it would limit flying to 6.1 and beyond, people had been saying for years that flying diminished the immersiveness of the gameplay--skipping mobs, elites, quests, and essentially 95% of the game's actual content. Now that they say they're finally catering to that (previously very popular) argument, everyone and their uncle's brother is jumping on the polar opposite bandwagon. It's like everyone instantly forgot and is unwilling to acknowledge reality. It's mind-blowing.<br />
<br />
Not being able to fly (at launch) in like 7 zones is not going to make people unsub. It really isn't. The only thing that ever made people unsub was the economy or the fact that the game is aging. You can post all you want &quot;the lulz unsubbd cuz no cant frly bizzrd cant make gemes lulz&quot; but you'll be back unless something more serious prevents you from doing so.<br />
<br />
The simple fact is that you can't fly for the majority of the questing, anyway, if the previous model were to continue, and no one seems to be saying that that model was horrid--only the &quot;new&quot; decision because it's new. Because when it gets down to it, the kernel of truth here is that the no-fly policy is simply an extrapolation of the one that was already in place.<br />
<br />
No-fly mechanics like we see in Shadowmoon Valley (Outland version) doesn't make people fly more creatively or make flying more fun. People just don't fly around enemy bases. Because you get hit with a nuke and almost killed or dismounted and die from impact. The risk association makes it retarded to fly near such locations and no one does it. The mechanic then becomes redundant.<br />
<br />
If you don't believe in the immersion dilution effect, go to Orgrimmar and walk through it's streets and then fly over it. The difference is like going to New York City and playing with a Lego Empire State Building. (Hint: if something feels like a toy, it's not immersive; it's a toy.)<br />
<br />
That said, I am not against a zone like those present in Northrend, which were designed with flying in mind. I agree that Storm Peaks felt (and still feels) epic and amazing despite the fact that you can fly there. I won't deny that there are exceptions. But this philosophy can't be applied to an entire continent or there's no comparison to make it feel epic. If you take a 8' man and put him next to another 8' man, they'll just look like men. If you take the average Joe and put him next to a giant, you have context.<br />
<br />
You can't &quot;take away&quot; what wasn't given in the first place. Did they &quot;take away&quot; flying from you when you went to Northrend? No. You had to earn it to fly there. Just like in Azeroth. Just like in Pandaria. Just like in Outland. There is no logical counter-argument to this claim. These are facts. To use the rhetoric of &quot;taking away flying&quot; is factually incorrect.<br />
<br />
I agree that this causes problems for alts, but it's the same problem alts have always had. It is not a new problem, it is an extension of a problem. Making thousands of gold is just as much of a time sink as doing a few legendary quests (that will be attached to lore, have characters, and ultimately be more interesting than farming for mats to sell to make gold to get flying). There's no real adjustment there.<br />
<br />
<br />
Because they said that that area wont have flying.<br />
<br />
No they didn't. They only said that Netherstorm would be added after launch. They never said that the zone will never have flying. They did say that we will be able to fly in Draenor (which includes Netherstorm) after 6.1.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are legitimate design reasons to disallow flying, and the fact that they're not bringing them up makes me worried that they're not actually going to be designing Draenor that much around no-flying at all, and this change is going to end up being as horribly arbitrary as I'd feared.</div></div><hr />

But being mad over designers tailoring an experience for you so that you can discover landscapes, atmospheres, etc. In a way that's not zooming past everything to get to your minimap objectives... I really don't.<br />
<br />
If you want to play a session game for 30 minutes and be done with it, there are PLENTY of awesome games out there, including by Blizzard.<br />
<br />
In short: wait for beta and then give feedback on quests that feel tedious because you can't fly. Until then, remember: patience. Discipline.<br />
<br />
Because get this, not everyone loves to derp around on a ground mound exploring and smelling flowers. A LOT of people hate questing, they hate leveling, they hate dailies. I'm one of them. I don't enjoy leveling at the start of the expac, I consider it a punishment for something bad I did in a previous life that I must suffer through so I can get to end game and do things I enjoy, like playing with my friends and killing shit in dungeons and raids. Everyone in my guild tries to race through leveling as quick as possible because it sucks.<br />
<br />
The only reason they gave for this was &quot;makes questing trivial&quot; well I don't fucking care how trivial questing is at max level. Why would I quest? I'm already max level. What could they offer me to quest at max level? VP gear? Gated behind rep? Yeah they tried that, I didn't do it then either. People play this game for different reasons. I consider questing annoying single player collect boar heart bullshit. This is an mmo, I have fun playing with FRIENDS.<br />

<br />
now ur acting like that blue and avoiding the question.<br />
<br />
at max level you are no longer leveling, with that in mind ill retry<br />
<br />
what dose flying/not flying at max level take away/add to the leveling process? the only problem with this that i can see is 2 seater mounts<br />
<br />
It doesn't. Everyone knows the real reason they're doing this. To make more pvp. So that people can't fly in and out of world pvp. They don't have the balls to say that cause the majority of players play on pve realms and would freak on them. So they'll just keep being vague and giving non answers to explain why they're taking it away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep, their whole &quot;Questing gets trivial omg!&quot; is beyond retarded reasoning, because their questing will always be idiot proof easy.<br />
<br />
They should say &quot;no flying allows for a better zone flow, and gives us more freedom in how we present landscapes and vistas to the player.&quot;<br />
Something like: Riding out of a dense wood onto a hill top and suddenly seeing a valley in front of you just doesn't work with flying mounts where you're 50m above every tree.</div></div><hr />

Before Blizzard announced it would limit flying to 6.1 and beyond, people had been saying for years that flying diminished the immersiveness of the gameplay--skipping mobs, elites, quests, and essentially 95% of the game's actual content. Now that they say they're finally catering to that (previously very popular) argument, everyone and their uncle's brother is jumping on the polar opposite bandwagon. It's like everyone instantly forgot and is unwilling to acknowledge reality. It's mind-blowing.<br />
.<br />
Its only a small vocal group that was complaining, now they are forcing people to commit to a different playstyle which adds another boring timesink for those who dont care about questing at max level: they are removing choice and are listening to those who thrive on other peoples misfortune, thats just the wrong way to go (same for the removal of reforging).<br />
Most people I play with dislike the fact that flying at max level will be postponed and artificially gated since it means the game will be less fun for them: plain and simple.</div></div><hr />

I'm seeing hot pink and hearts and people say blizzard is sexist with their platekinis and lack of strong female characters. Where do they come up with this stuff? It's kind of amusing, there was a big thread making fun of Blizzard for showing those 9 lore characters on the warlords poster and not one was female.

<br />
I mean seriously, just as Northrend had multiple unique snowy zones, The ED could have multiple green forest zones. Ideas I have come up with:<br />
&gt;Your classic green forest, swathed in glimmering mist<br />
&gt;A jungle with geothermal activity - hot springs and volcanoes.<br />
&gt;Fields of trippy, dream twisted landscape like this: http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20081001002014/wowwiki/images/3/3e/Emeralddream.jpg<br />
&gt; A heavily Nightmare corrupted area<br />
&gt; A Worgen infested scrubland<br />
&gt; Mountain forests<br />
&gt; A Mountain Giant as an entire zone.<br />
&gt; A charred glade which has been burnt out by the locals in an attempt to curb the Nightmare's corruption.<br />
&gt;A rushing river network.<br />
&gt;A lush archipalgo.<br />
<br />
They could do anything they wanted, it's literally a land made of dreams - how much creative freedom can you want?<br />
<br />
<br />
If you want ED so bad, which won't be happening, there are several quests that deal with it and even let you go there. I suggest going and doing them over...and over...cause that's the closest your getting to ED unless they make it a raid. No ED expansion. Thank god.</div></div><hr />

Tigole and Furor gone (WoTLK)? Flying at 77, then changed to 70! Yeah, no flying in Pandaland until level cap, but that's still not as bad as no flying until the first major content patch. Furor comes back, NO FLYING!!!!111!!</div></div><hr />

They have no good reason to back up 'no-flying till 6.1' they say it's for immersion, yet at the same time they contradict themselves saying there's not good lore reason to do it. To me it's pretty obvious, they want to push content as fast as possible that means they need to hide unfinished zones by keeping people from flying till 6.1. I can only see that as being the only logical argument for keeping people on the ground. It annoys me that they have to lie and pretend they are 'sticking to their guns' and doing it for 'immersion' when clearly they don't care about those things and have always caved in to the pressure.<br />
<br />
Also this argument;<br />
<br />
What was wrong with the Wrath model of grounded leveling for main, BoA tome for alts?<br />
If leveling is supposed to be trivial for alts, why not just make them all jump to max level?<br />
<br />
His answer is completely moronic, you still had to do the quests and go through the whole zone to get to level 80. All it did was cut the leveling down by about 1/3 and gave you the peace of mind of not having to deal with PvP gankers at low level zones. I mean you could argue that I could reach cap without even questing just sitting at the major city and running dungeons. Lack of flying in alt, doesn't make it any less trivial than it already is. If anything it means I will likely stick to my character and level it all the way to cap. With MoP it's been such a drag for some alts especially because once you hit cap the grind becomes unbearable when you have a fresh toon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, the worst character ever to make it into a game. While he started as a pretty interesting character in TBC, the WotLK+ Garrosh is nothing but a one dimensional angry orc stereotype. They've had 3 expansions to develop him and absolutely nothing has changed. What a joke. I care absolutely nothing about what happens with him, and since he's now pretty much the center point of the WoW story I no longer care about that either. Which is kinda saddening since I've been a big lore fan since I first learned English and could understand the intros to each mission in the old RTS games.</div></div><hr />

You people are babies and forgot about what WoW was about. Vanilla and TBC/WotLK was some of the best times in WoW's history. Vanilla, you was on FOOT, no mount till 40. Even then it was slow as hell till IF YOU WAS LUCKY could afford an epic ground mount at 60, which was very few people. You went through the entire Outlands without them till 70. Went through 90% of WotlK without them. WoD will be fine, quit expecting shit to be handed to you easy peasy. What's worse, is most of you are just mad because you can't rush to 100 and then gank lowbies. All it is. Grow up people, or unsub and quit.</div></div><hr />

In my opinion its a terrific idea and I'm totally looking forward to it :)<br />
<br />
Na it is not - I like to be able to fly if I hit level 100 and to start raiding. So in Blizzard terms I have to walk to the raid instance entrances by foot till 6.1 ... for what - because it is troublesome for Blizzard to do proper quests/game mechnics that works well with flying mounts? As always they choose the cheap/simple path and telling us bull-shit about the real reason. They are plain lazy and uncreative. Why not allow flying like it was the latest expacs after hitting max level? Why delay it till another content patch? We have to go by foot 3-4 months?</div></div><hr />

Back when I was young, had no kids, and had LOTS of time to do as I pleased, I would have said this was awesome. As it stands, they need to realize their player base is no longer 13 year olds sitting in their mommy and daddy's houses (I never was, started WoW at like 24). We have lives now. We have children and bills and work women and responsibilities. The flying thing allows those same, die hard, been here since the beginning players to speed up the process a little and get them caught up to the folks who can sit on the game 9 hours a day, 7 days a week. You folks that are all against flying need to remember that you're not the only people playing the game. It's neat that you're unemployed, living at home still at 25, and able to play a videogame longer than most people are at work. I can't. Try seeing it from all sides, not just the speed levelers for realm first 50s, the folks who like to stop and look at every pixel, and the folks who would rather have this epic trek through 5 levels. WoW needs to come to terms with the fact that hardly ANYONE plays their game for the leveling experience......they play for the endgame PvE/PvP. So making the part that the minority like a little easier on the majority doesn't seem like a bad thing to me, and actually sounds a lot like why we ended up with the raid content we have now.</div></div><hr />

It will afect Blizzard pockets . Instead of geting my(our) money , the Steam will take them. Voluntary giving your profit to someone else. Such a good business plan.<br />

The few thousand mad little mob who quit over this one feature will not dent them in the slightest I assure you. If the 7.5 million subs or whatnot dropped to say, 2.5 million due to just this feature that's one thing, but it won't. Blizzard will always cater to the majority of what players want, and not enough are mad about no flying till 6.1. Nobody is seeing this from the game point of view or a dev point of view....the haters are seeing it through their rose tented &quot;i want things to me easier for ME&quot; glasses.<br />
<br />
As for the person talking about we're not 13 anymore and have jobs, true enough your right. I'm 32, work a 12 hour shift job 4 days and 1 night a week. I still don't mind this change if it helps WoW get back to what it was pre Cata. I find it a form of entertainment being stuck on the ground, make's us have to use some of those ground only mounts we've had stuck away forever and don't use. Mechan'O Hog anyone?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JoeShmo</div><div class="date">2013-11-21, 10:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">small no-fly zones are ok, the whole continent is way to punishing. Especially without lore reason.<br />
I don't feel the need to justify good gameplay with lore. Why can Four Winds virmen defeat Onyxia? Good gameplay.<br />
<br />
Believable lore and setting, must be internally consistent, is very important to a RPG.<br />
We agree, but gameplay is more important, at least at Blizzard. Other studios design with different values.<br />
<br />
I don't want leveling to be easier/quicker. I want repeated content to have less travel/downtime.<br />
We don't think flying makes questing quicker. We think it makes it trivial. There is a difference.<br />
<br />
I find it interesting that they are so adamant about taking away flying every expansion (at least wrath had a good reason), give no lore or explanation of why they are doing other than &quot;it makes questing trivial&quot; (Which it doesnt) , and its perfectly ok.<br />
<br />
Its also interesting that other gameplay changes, like race/class combos, still do require strict lore adherence , when its the exact same thing as the flying issue. (Gameplay, as in racial traits [Min maxing] , and character customization/enjoyment [A big factor in playing the game]) <br />
<br />
They keep saying, and other people keep regurgitating , that flying somehow &quot;ruins&quot; content, which is tenably false. The risk involved in riding on a ground mount is negligible while questing, gathering, or any activity aside from jumping off a tall cliff and hoping to miss the ground. The only time in wow's history where being on the ground was &quot;engaging and/or dangerous&quot; was back in Vanilla when it had the mother of all Daze mechanics and dismounting by getting sneezed at; it was also a time when there was actually dense mob population, so much that it was nigh impossible to just run through or past mobs without getting dismounted. This has not been the case for years now. Flying doesnt negate quest objectives or risks, or encounters. You still have to land near the quest objective, which always have either no enemies in a 100 yards near it, or at least 1 mob nearby that instantly attacks you. Being on a ground mount, or a flying one does not change how you interact in those situations. <br />
<br />
The only thing a flying mount does is ensure you reach your destination quicker and more efficiently; which blizzard apparently states is not an issue. The ONLY reason why flying is being frowned upon by blizzard, is their continued insecurity with people not &quot;fully experiencing&quot; their content they make, the exact way they want you to. Flying does nothing to &quot;trivialize&quot; questing or encounters, it only cuts out the middle man if there ever was one. <br />
<br />
Being forced to the ground does not make the experience any more engaging, thrilling, awe inspiring, or difficult; and if anything, theres a valid difference of opinion on whether the scenery on the ground is more beautiful or the scenery in the air is. And in the same breath, paladins, shaman and druids need more race diversity &quot;because gameplay is more important than lore&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, makes no sense how they are doing this. I moved my main to Bleeding Hollow for more population but the rest of my chars are still on Gorefiend, and it's dead as dirt there...been waiting and waiting, I don't want to spend 25 dollars per character to move 6 characters :/</div></div><hr />

When you start resorting to hyperbolic &quot;urrb durrb, why don't we just give you a room full of bosses and free level 100s&quot; arguments then it's safe to say you're not intelligently engaging with the concerns of the players any longer.<br />
<br />
There are legitimate design reasons to disallow flying, and the fact that they're not bringing them up makes me worried that they're not actually going to be designing Draenor that much around no-flying at all, and this change is going to end up being as horribly arbitrary as I'd feared.<br />
<br />
I feel for the devs. It must be rough having to get a constant stream of bitching about this subject or the next. The problem is, people don't read or care about the long, thought out blue posts. They just keep up their RABBLE RABBLE! attitudes and expect that a horribly written, misspelled tweet to GC will change his mind on the subject.<br />

Because get this, not everyone loves to derp around on a ground mound exploring and smelling flowers. A LOT of people hate questing, they hate leveling, they hate dailies. I'm one of them. I don't enjoy leveling at the start of the expac, I consider it a punishment for something bad I did in a previous life that I must suffer through so I can get to end game and do things I enjoy, like playing with my friends and killing shit in dungeons and raids. Everyone in my guild tries to race through leveling as quick as possible because it sucks.<br />
<br />
The only reason they gave for this was &quot;makes questing trivial&quot; well I don't fucking care how trivial questing is at max level. Why would I quest? I'm already max level. What could they offer me to quest at max level? VP gear? Gated behind rep? Yeah they tried that, I didn't do it then either. People play this game for different reasons. I consider questing annoying single player collect boar heart bullshit. This is an mmo, I have fun playing with FRIENDS.<br />

It doesn't. Everyone knows the real reason they're doing this. To make more pvp. So that people can't fly in and out of world pvp. They don't have the balls to say that cause the majority of players play on pve realms and would freak on them. So they'll just keep being vague and giving non answers to explain why they're taking it away.<br />
<br />
Then don't play and RPG if you hate questing/leveling. That would probably solve so many of this games problems.<br />

thats a lie bc was horrible for leveling and gearing take those glasses off plz.<br />
<br />
leveling wasnt intresting the only nice zone was nagrana and mabye blades edge rest was meh and while im at it im on a pve server so your last sentantanc dosent apply to me<br />
<br />
BC was great, no glasses here. Couldn't have been that bad considering how quickly it was growing, and how many subs it had =p Good try though.<br />

Didn't they say they were connecting some dead realms with high population ones?</div></div><hr />

Notice the european flag above the area 52 connected realms part...?<br />

That's because it's EU-Area 52 which is a low populated alliance dominant realm. Not the US-Area 52 horde megaserver.</div></div><hr />

If that was going to happen, it probably would have been after the first 5 million subs were lost under their watch. Rightly or wrongly, Blizz doesn't seem inclined to blame the dev team for sub losses.</div></div><hr />

This will be no different.<br />

Yeah they stand on their own. That's why heroics are super hard and we have to do a million dailies every day.<br />
<br />
/highfive<br />
<br />
Though I actually preferred harder heroics. Dailies and valor point gear gated behind rep can all die in a fire. Flying is something I can live without but keeping us from ever flying in current content again feels stupid and lame. I get that they face SOME limitations with quest design if they know characters can fly in the zone, but that entire battle front area in Krasarang Wilds worked just fine. Hell the fort you go to for the &quot;Change of Command&quot; quest even has fliers that'll knock you out of the air! It worked just great - even on my somewhat-sorta-geared main I have to be careful going there to help people. It added to the challenge and I found it quite enjoyable.<br />

Thank you. I was quite concerned for a moment there. Timeless isle was unplayable at launch - literally unplayable. I was wondering if connecting the realms would give twice the server &quot;bandwidth&quot; (capacity really). Ah well.</div></div><hr />

This big argument is a bunch of crap... its a bunch of whiners hoping blizzard will cave like they sometimes cave to mass whining. You're not going to be flying in 6.0, get over it, oh noes. It's a damn game. Stop playing if you hate it so much. If its that much of an excess time sink that you can't handle it, you probably don't have the time to be playing games in the first place. Drop your sub if you hate it... you're still playing now, so it's obviously not that bad. MMO's are not for the short of time, there's plenty of better games out there for you.</div></div><hr />

When they start to reduce how easy it has become by postponing flying, everyone is up in arms about how hard it will be. <br />
<br />
I think removing LFG and LFR and forcing servers to become real communities again would also help undo a lot of damage, but think of the uproar that would bring! I truly think that the Blizzard design staff is damned if they do and damned if they don't at this point.</div></div><hr />
