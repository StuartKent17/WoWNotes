Elite PvP Gear and Transmog<br />
Are the elite PvP sets from past seasons/xpacs going account wide like the CM sets are? I've heard yes, and no, But I've never seen Blizzard comment on the topic.<br />
Yes. You still need to meet the equip requirements on the item you're transmogging to, so it is functionally unlocked only the class (or classes if you are super pro) you earned the items on.<br />
<br />
The old tabards do not have any equip requirements, so they will be available for any character to use.<br />
<br />
inb4BUTMYGLADMOUNTS: Like many systems that are added in during the game's lifespan, this is a case where the items and rating system that delivered them are very legacy, and we don't have a good way to know what your rating was in a given season this many years later. Transmog handling isn't indicative of a philosophy shift in how we handle prestigious PVP rewards, and we may change how this works for tabards &amp; cloaks going forward.<br />
<br />
Will the xmog system be bnet wide or account wide? Also will you need to login to the character for said items to pop like heirlooms when they first came out?<br />
Yes, population of the transmog collection will be very similar to the addition of toy and heirloom collections. Each character will contribute to your account-wide (battle.net) collection as you log them in.<br />
<br />
One last question though, you said meet the requirements, In my case that would just mean a priest that is at level x (x being whatever level the gear was at the time) so for cata elite gear the alt priest in question would need to be 85 and so on correct? <br />
<br />
Not just priests I had that were also 2200+ in that particular season?<br />
Yes, if you have a set of elite gear in your priest's bank, once that is added to your transmog collection any other Priests on your account only need to meet the level requirement to gain access to that transmog. Your Mages wouldn't be able to use it, because the gear is restricted to the Priest class. Again, this may not be how it works in future seasons, just for legacy seasons.

<br />
Vanilla PvP Sets and Transmog<br />
Any character that is able to purchase the Replica pieces right now, will still be able to use them for transmogrification in Legion. However, the appearances won't be made available account wide. The same rule also applies to the Replica weapons.<br />
<br />
However, you can still unlock these items, on a per character basis, by obtaining 1800 Battleground Rating in Rated Battlegrounds.

World PvP<br />
Can't the honor talent just activate when entering PvP combat?<br />
Honor talents activate whenever you engage in PvP including out in the world. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/405870-wpvp/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20742805082?page=1#3))<br />
<br />
PvP and Ability Pruning<br />
daily reminder: this thread is already 5 days old and still not a single response.<br />
Generally when you see a major point of discussion on the forums that is being met with what seems like complete silence, it's not because we're stonewalling and assuming the concerns will just go away if we ignore them for long enough. We're usually discussing the same issues internally with just as much enthusiasm (though generally with fewer memes and hashtags), but don't have anything to share just yet.<br />
<br />
It'd be most helpful if this type of discussion could focus on specific examples of abilities that you miss, and why you feel they're important to deep and enjoyable gameplay. <br />
<br />
I'd like to describe one category of abilities that is the least likely to return: tools added in recent expansions that ultimately contributed to homogenization. BC is generally well-regarded historically when in comes to WoW PvP (and raiding). But then we gave everyone 4 new abilities in Wrath; then 3 more on top of that in Cata. And then reworking the talent system in Mists and Warlords actually introduced a ton of new active abilities and procs (since the old talent &quot;trees&quot; actually were mostly passive modifiers with only a handful of active gameplay drivers).<br />
<br />
Along the way, we made what I'll freely admit were design mistakes. The underlying one was probably just committing to adding X new abilities each expansion even when many classes genuinely were complete and functional packages without any need for that many new abilities. But then more specifically, coming up with fun and desirable new abilities is hard, and a bit too often we turned to the easy path of looking for a class's weaknesses and offering solutions to those weaknesses. Paladins lack mobility when Freedom isn't up? Let's give them them an array of passive and active sprints to choose among. Shamans don't really have CC? Let's give them Hex, a stun, and a root. And so forth. <br />
<br />
Subjectively, removing those things now feels like a nerf, and objectively, it essentially is one. But in the context of broader CC and cooldown disarmament, it's not coming at the expense of balance. And offering new tools, especially through the PvP talent system, that can accentuate strengths, seems like a better path than continually shoring up weaknesses at the expense of diversity.<br />
<br />
Finally, I'd like to respond to the idea that this is all about increasing accessibility for new players at the expense of veterans. It is not. The new player experience has always been fairly streamlined, with only a handful of abilities available, and new ones meted out over the course of many levels. We don't think that the existence or absence of a cooldown or CC tool at level 75 has any impact on a new player's ability to approach and enjoy the game. But it does have impact on the clarity of gameplay at max level, spec homogeneity, and how impactful each individual ability can be in a world full of analogues and counters.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the replies so far. A couple of specific responses, though I am by no means discounting the other examples so far that aren't getting direct replies:<br />
<br />
For Warlocks - No baseline Demonic Portal - Remove gate way and give us Portal Back. No Shadowfury<br />
Though it still exists as a talent, Demonic Portal is actually an example of removing weaknesses in a way that harms class differentiation. Going back to BC, one of the core differences between the two pure offensive casters, warlock and mage, was that warlocks were far more durable and &quot;tanky,&quot; while mages were frail but had more mobility and escape tools (Nova+Blink being central to that). Giving an instant teleport/escape ability like Demonic Portal to warlocks did a great deal to blur that distinction, and the class's design might have gone in a quite different direction without it. <br />
<br />
Shadowfury falls more under the general CC disarmament pass. It's an ability that used to be available solely to Destruction warlocks, deep in their talent tree. An AoE stun like that is incredibly strong, and was only balanced as a tool exclusive to a spec that faced significant challenges in PvP at the time, due to their reliance on cast-time spells and other factors. When it became available to the class as a whole alongside their other CC, as part of the Mists talent system conversion, that simply proved to be too much, and so it was a prime candidate when we started looking to dial back the overall amount of crowd control being thrown around.<br />
<br />
For me, abilities like Dark Simulacrum added a great level of depth. A friend of mine loves the ability and the freedom it offers: do I need a heal? Let me put it on a healer. That mage is probably going to Mirror Image, let me steal that. That sort of stuff.<br />
Dark Simulacrum is a talent available through the Honor system, so that exact gameplay, which we agree is awesome, should still be present. Like Grounding Totem, these types of abilities really shine in PvP, and were subject to so many restrictions in raid/dungeon usage that many players often gave up even trying to use them. And then occasionally we'd miss a spell flag, and you'd be able to entirely negate a major boss mechanic like Xhul'horac's Void Surge (not intended, but left in due to how many groups had come to rely on it by the time we realized the problem). Those are fun and cool abilities, but they simply fit better in the PvP space, and the dedicated Honor system allows us to make that distinction now.

<br />
Legion PvP<br />
We understand your concern here and the enthusiasm people have to test class balance with everything unlocked. The reality here is that there our primary focus is not currently on class balance but on leveling through the honor system. In the not to distant future, we will want to focus solely on class balance and we'll set everyone to honor level 50. Once we've done that, there will be no turning back. But there are still some stages of the Alpha where more people will be invited to test and they'll get their first experience leveling up through the system. We've recently made changes to the amount of honor required to get to level 10 that will be seen in our next build. We'd like to test those changes in a live environment.<br />
<br />
My question is, idk if there's a way to be specific enough about it but: what is the overall goal here for length of time to level up?<br />
<br />
For instance, in relation to time it takes to get a full conquest set of gear? Are you aiming for the time it takes to get to honor level 50 to be relatively the same as getting a full set of conquest gear? A bit more? A bit less? A lot more?<br />
It should take longer than it currently takes to get a full set of honor gear (bearing in mind that the new honor system has a &quot;rest&quot; system similar to XP). In Legion, the rate at which you earn honor is similar to Warlords.<br />
<br />
We'll take a look at the rate at which you earn honor in Skirmishes.<br />
<br />
Also, if you really want to check out Honor Level 50 matches, you can coordinate War Games with &quot;Tournament Rules&quot; checked in the UI. Players are all Honor Level 50 and set to the same &quot;item level&quot; when Tournament Rules are enabled.<br />
<br />
Prestige is 100% voluntary and offers no power advantage. We are fine if players who care solely about their rating do not Prestige. Rating is serving them fine as a progression mechanic.

One of the most interesting things about testing the new spell anims in Legion is how often I spent just hitting stuff, not for a quest. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/710018118576381952))<br />
They can be a bit noisy in raids though. even if other players are toned down. Next raid testing though I’ll prob make a list.<br />

With the rogue animations, I'm noticing a trend. Many classes seem to have a slash animation with a wide colored arc. Only difference seems to be the color of the arc. Those animations are going to get old fast. Hoping there's an option to just keep to the old ones but somehow I doubt it. I was hoping with their &quot;class fantasy&quot; idea that each class would have all unique animations that weren't shared with another class. I wasn't expecting a few unique animations per class. Then again, Blizzard can't even do unique areas and quest chains for each artifact. Some quest chains are nearly identical (i.e. affliction warlock, balance druid, and unholy DK). So guess it was too much to ask for complete uniqueness.</div></div><hr />

Like... Why even bother using something like Warcraft as inspiration for an episode, if you're going to give it people that have zero idea of what the races look like in the first place, and just have screenshots to go off of.<br />
<br />
They all look absolutely terrible. I mean, the Troll is somewhat passable, except for the tusks being laughably small...Or is that supposed to be a female? Because quite frankly, I don't even know. The Draenei looks nothing like a Draenei, and dear god, what the hell is that? A Worgen? That doesn't even look remotely wolf like. Even ignoring that it's supposed to be a Worgen, that doesn't even look like a werewolf. That literally looks like someone put a plastic dog nose on someone's face, did a bit of dabbling with makeup, and called it a day.<br />
<br />
These people are supposed to be professionals, for god's sake we have a movie coming out in a few months that uses better makeup and artistry to make the Orcs actually look like Orcs, and more impressively, look like the characters they're representing.<br />
<br />
These? These are awful, and if I were a judge, even not basing it on Warcraft, I would have kicked them all off the stage. These all look half assed, poorly done, rush jobs with no care or effort put into them, save for the Troll and Tauren, and even then, they look pretty damned lackluster. When you have people cosplaying better then this at Blizzcon, and these guys are supposed to be professionals, you know there's a problem.<br />
<br />
I demand an option for none of the above. They're just..all terrible. Terrible job, terrible episode, terrible special affects artists.<br />

As I thought, you have literally no idea what's going on. The mounts are not 100% drop rate, actually the numbers are close to .0X%, bosses are on a weekly lockout. Faster respaws means it's less annoying to get your weekly kill, it won't make it any easier to get a mount.<br />

Usually the contestants do a great job with whatever they're working on. However, the cartoony look of WoW doesn't really lend itself well to the horror-theme that most Face Off makeup jobs usually employ, which they certainly did here. On top of that, the models used for the races are completely wrong. The Draenei should have been a really bulky bodybuilder or football player type, same with the Tauren. The worgen female should have been more slender. <br />
<br />
The worst ones are the tauren and goblin...they're so bad I can't even tell what GENDER they're supposed to be. Troll is the &quot;best of the worst&quot; but still missing the long nose which is kind of iconic for male trolls.<br />

Honestly I would have had them refer to the high-quality CGI cinematics for a better idea of what the WoW races should look like in a more realistic light.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the tauren, making a tauren look good without HUGE everything is impossible.... it wont look like a tuaren, and putting massive muzzle and horns on somone wont fit well as it will keep falling off<br />
the troll looks like half male half female but looks good, other then the huge ears, they are suppost to be long, not wide<br />
the worgen, same problem, putting a working muzzle on a person is dificult without it falling off so she had to make this weird thing... with the muzzle it may have looked rather good<br />
dranei looks ok, prob my favorite as it fits a deathknight well, but again size matters, the tauren and dranei both should have had muscle men to put the makeup on as they are iconic for their sizes<br />
the goblin, is female, now if it was a male goblin, longer nose, less huge ears, it woulda been perfect, but the female goblin, its all about those lips, keep the teeth but make a fat pair of lips, and smaller ears, less creepy eyes, woulda been perfect<br />
<br />
thing is you cant blame these guys 100% they are horror experts, not cartoon experts<br />
they didnt have muscle men to put the makeup on for tauren/dranei<br />
putting huge tusks/horns/muzles/big noses would have been dificult and costly and time consuming</div></div><hr />

And you've got to remember, people: The show is about coming up with stuff in a limited amount of time. Considering that and how the artists lacked familiarity with the franchise (combined with the poor reference sources provided), I'm actually surprised that they came off as well as they did.<br />

<br />
First off, they had three days to work on the concept art, prosthetics and makeup, probably about 15 hours total, with the third day dedicated to application.<br />
<br />
Tauren: No experience with the franchise. He originally wanted to make a cowl to try and emulate the silhouette of the tauren, but ended up scrapping the idea after wasting a lot of time on it. His goal with the face was to allow the actor to emote, so he shortened the snout, and eventually widened the facial features. Planned on making one full horn and one broken horn, but had numerous problems with the mold and ended up doing two broken horns. Judges really liked the technical quality of the sculpt and all the detail, especially considering the artist considered it to be a poor example of his work, but ultimately thought it was inaccurate because it just didn't look like a tauren.<br />
<br />
Troll: No experience with the franchise. She took a lot of notes and asked a lot of questions when Chris Robinson came in to consult. She ultimately chose to create something that was rather close to the game version, with a dark, voodoo motif. She actually scultped pronounced ridges on the &quot;skullcap&quot; so that she could make it look like the hair was projecting upwards without having to use long, heavily styled hair. Decided not to do the three-fingered hands because she was limited on time. Judges really appreciated the quality of the hair and how close it was to the game's depiction, feeling that it was extremely faithful.<br />
<br />
Worgen: Fan of the games. Decided to make a female worgen druid. Chose to make a shorter snout so the actor could better emote, and attempt something that looked &quot;midway through transformation,&quot; which was advised against during the day two consultation. Initially put a lot of work into creating the clawed hands, but ended up rushing to finish them without being able to put much detail into them, then had difficulty with the mold. Also had trouble making the paws on the last day. Judges felt that it was fairly accurate apart from the snout, but that her attempts to include hands and feet resulted in a product that was overall unfinished and sloppy.<br />
<br />
Draenei: Fan of the franchise, played all the games. He took Chris Robinson's advice to make an draenei death knight with pale, undead-looking skin. His main focus was on crafting an elaborate and detailed skull ridge and to get the tentacles to look like they were growing out of the face, with a cowl for the tentacles growing out from behind the ears. Also fabricated a tail. Put a lot of effort into selling that it was both a draenei and an undead while painting it. Judges considered it to be extremely accurate and felt that the paint job in particular was especially good, and recognized that a lot of work went into the tentacles, horns, and tail and it was all of high quality. In particular appreciated the added layer of making it a death knight.<br />
<br />
Goblin: No experience with the franchise. Ignored Chris Robinson's advice to make her cute and feminine, instead opting to combine male goblin and female goblin features and make her more realistic and less cute. Tried to scale down the ears and facial features to make it less stylized. Judges heavily criticized the poor paint job, the hair not being woven into the sculpt properly, and the lack of taking risk with the character's proportions to do something crazy. &quot;It was just a bad job.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
What are you even talking about. It was which looked best for the face-off show entries. What does that have to do with character models?<br />
<br />
Troll and Draenei looked best. Rest looked like shit. I didn't even realise that was a Worgen and thought it was a Pandaren.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First off, they had three days to work on the concept art, prosthetics and makeup, probably about 15 hours total, with the third day dedicated to application.<br />
<br />
Tauren: No experience with the franchise. He originally wanted to make a cowl to try and emulate the silhouette of the tauren, but ended up scrapping the idea after wasting a lot of time on it. His goal with the face was to allow the actor to emote, so he shortened the snout, and eventually widened the facial features. Planned on making one full horn and one broken horn, but had numerous problems with the mold and ended up doing two broken horns. Judges really liked the technical quality of the sculpt and all the detail, especially considering the artist considered it to be a poor example of his work, but ultimately thought it was inaccurate because it just didn't look like a tauren.<br />
<br />
Troll: No experience with the franchise. She took a lot of notes and asked a lot of questions when Chris Robinson came in to consult. She ultimately chose to create something that was rather close to the game version, with a dark, voodoo motif. She actually scultped pronounced ridges on the &quot;skullcap&quot; so that she could make it look like the hair was projecting upwards without having to use long, heavily styled hair. Decided not to do the three-fingered hands because she was limited on time. Judges really appreciated the quality of the hair and how close it was to the game's depiction, feeling that it was extremely faithful.<br />
<br />
Worgen: Fan of the games. Decided to make a female worgen druid. Chose to make a shorter snout so the actor could better emote, and attempt something that looked &quot;midway through transformation,&quot; which was advised against during the day two consultation. Initially put a lot of work into creating the clawed hands, but ended up rushing to finish them without being able to put much detail into them, then had difficulty with the mold. Also had trouble making the paws on the last day. Judges felt that it was fairly accurate apart from the snout, but that her attempts to include hands and feet resulted in a product that was overall unfinished and sloppy.<br />
<br />
Draenei: Fan of the franchise, played all the games. He took Chris Robinson's advice to make an draenei death knight with pale, undead-looking skin. His main focus was on crafting an elaborate and detailed skull ridge and to get the tentacles to look like they were growing out of the face, with a cowl for the tentacles growing out from behind the ears. Also fabricated a tail. Put a lot of effort into selling that it was both a draenei and an undead while painting it. Judges considered it to be extremely accurate and felt that the paint job in particular was especially good, and recognized that a lot of work went into the tentacles, horns, and tail and it was all of high quality. In particular appreciated the added layer of making it a death knight.<br />
<br />
Goblin: No experience with the franchise. Ignored Chris Robinson's advice to make her cute and feminine, instead opting to combine male goblin and female goblin features and make her more realistic and less cute. Tried to scale down the ears and facial features to make it less stylized. Judges heavily criticized the poor paint job, the hair not being woven into the sculpt properly, and the lack of taking risk with the character's proportions to do something crazy. &quot;It was just a bad job.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Damn those costumes look shite i mean ive seen cosplayers do a better job at blizzcon!<br />
To be fair, they only had about 15~20 hours to make these with almost no prep time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Asotcha</div><div class="date">2016-03-25, 04:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really did like how the full figure of the worgen looked like a character that could play a part. She seemed like someone that youd come across making stew quietly in a shack in the wilderness, and probably have to get up the nerve to talk to and try to not mention her nose.<br />
<br />
The Troll and Draenei were the best though, hands down. I'm so glad that the person who did the Draenei was a player and understood the world it came out of so well. At first it seemed something was 'off' about it to me, but after thinking about it, I realized its just because the ones we see in game have such a broader chest and arms. No control over that and nothing to do over their makeup--after all his model wasn't a fridge ;) I like that he made it so the DK was an undead priest--that created a backstory and explanation for his less-swole frame right there.<br />
<br />
The goblin reminds me of old- Biff Tannen from Back to the Future 2.<br />
<br />
Too bad things kept going wrong for the tauren, but I guess thats just how things go sometimes. I havn't seen the show but I wonder why they didnt try to fake a hump at the Nth hour just to see how it went.<br />
<br />
I didn't even notice the fingers on the troll, that face and hair :D awesome. in the pic where the model is standing with the artist, its like 'This is the sacrifice I captured from Gurubashi Arena. The Loa be pleased' xD</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why do you think it unreasonable for Blizz to make the beastie appear more often, thus making it easier to get a kill and not lower the drop rate?<br />
<br />
because you can get stuff only once a week anyway? lowering the drop rate would just alienate more people, its not fun camping their spawns in the middle of nowhere with jack to do, now you dont want people to even have a chance at decent droprate?</div></div><hr />

For the time they were given to put the makeup on these look awesome except for Goblin and Worgen, those are amateur and shitty but the other 3 are sick. If these were done on a movie set they'd have a lot more hands involved and time to make it look a hundred times better. I'd take makeup over CGI any time.</div></div><hr />

The actor in the make up was sneering under the make up and mask rigging and the mouth and nose looked like they were really a part of the person in it. The Goblin and the Worgen did both suck (and subsequently, were the bottom 2). The Draenei was ok, my gripe was they didn't use ice blue contacts for his eyes so he'd look somewhat like a death knight with the glowing eyes (all the others used some sort of colored contacts).<br />
<br />
Rob Kazinsky (Orgrim in the Warcraft movie) was the guest judge and he was the harshest of all the judges. He complimented the Troll and Draenei, but said the Goblin was too shiny and looked like a cheap halloween costume because the hair was just pulled up through big holes cut into the mask. He said the Tauren wasn't a Tauren, but a bi-pedal cow man that didn't really do much to look like a Tauren since it had no nose ring or the humped back. He liked that the Worgen looked like a druid as described, but the muzzle and ears were all wrong on the mask.</div></div><hr />

This is the work of one person, basically an amatuer, and something like what, 15 hours.<br />

Makeup would look so horrible for a warcraft movie and would take away the warcraft feel. I don't think you can do a warcraft movie without CGI unless you want the movie to look like complete shit.<br />

The Draenai kinda looks like the Prophet Velen. Troll nailed it, well the best you could probably do with making a troll in makeup looked good. The worgen looked to pale, I think if they made her face darker it would of looked better.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
I...I have no words for those costumes.<br />
<br />
Like... Why even bother using something like Warcraft as inspiration for an episode, if you're going to give it people that have zero idea of what the races look like in the first place, and just have screenshots to go off of.<br />
<br />
They all look absolutely terrible. I mean, the Troll is somewhat passable, except for the tusks being laughably small...Or is that supposed to be a female? Because quite frankly, I don't even know. The Draenei looks nothing like a Draenei, and dear god, what the hell is that? A Worgen? That doesn't even look remotely wolf like. Even ignoring that it's supposed to be a Worgen, that doesn't even look like a werewolf. That literally looks like someone put a plastic dog nose on someone's face, did a bit of dabbling with makeup, and called it a day.<br />
<br />
These people are supposed to be professionals, for god's sake we have a movie coming out in a few months that uses better makeup and artistry to make the Orcs actually look like Orcs, and more impressively, look like the characters they're representing.<br />
<br />
These? These are awful, and if I were a judge, even not basing it on Warcraft, I would have kicked them all off the stage. These all look half assed, poorly done, rush jobs with no care or effort put into them, save for the Troll and Tauren, and even then, they look pretty damned lackluster. When you have people cosplaying better then this at Blizzcon, and these guys are supposed to be professionals, you know there's a problem.<br />
<br />
I demand an option for none of the above. They're just..all terrible. Terrible job, terrible episode, terrible special affects artists.<br />
<br />
N'zoth looks friggen amazing though.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you didn't read they only had 15-20 hrs to work on these costumes lol.<br />

Lord of the Rings used practical costumes and the Hobbit used CGI mostly. Look how that turned out. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
I think lord of the rings could of done alot better if they used more CGI. Especially the orcs on LotR, but the hobbit did ok, it's also a different franchise not warcraft so.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reah</div><div class="date">2016-03-29, 12:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Draenei was the best and deserved the win. The Troll was great especially since it was produced by someone who had never played the game. The Tauren was not so good as far as a Tauren goes but the make up itself was really good, if I didn't know it was suppose to be a Tauren I would say it was a great looking minotaur type character. Unfortunately the artists who worked on the goblin and worgen just dropped the ball. Especially the one who is a big fan of WoW. She was a little too over confident on her fandom helping her create a good make up.<br />
<br />
To the people who say they are so awful and what not....if you can do better in the 15-20 hours they had then by all means show us what you got.</div></div><hr />

Explains why Tauren and Goblin look like shit, and why the Draenei looks pretty good. The troll looks great, surprised that the artist didn't play WoW. Worgen is fail.<br />

If you thought the Hobbit did &quot;ok&quot; for 2012-2014 movies, why would LoTR do any better? The Hobbit had 10+ years of technology ahead of LoTR and it didn't do much better with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It did &quot;better&quot; by slightly and with 10+ years of better tech. Practical effects with CGI as enhancements would have been a much better option and given it a more authentic feel. Way too much reliance on CGI.<br />
<br />
Also not sure how we went off-topic so hard. :P</div></div><hr />
