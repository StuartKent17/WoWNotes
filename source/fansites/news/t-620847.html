The zombie plague will end around noon PST, the Karazhan boss and the scourge invasion will be here for a few more days. The WotLK prologue is not over. <br />
We'd like to thank players for participating so zealously (and valiantly!) during the Great Zombie Plague of '08. Our intention with this event was to create something memorable and to literally change the face of Azeroth for a few days. This event is just one of many leading up to Wrath of the Lich King. As you know, the Scourge Invasion is now live as well and there is some other cool stuff coming up before all is said and done. Also, Hallow's End continues on!<br />
<br />
While we recognize that the event could prove to be disruptive at times, we hope you made the most out of it while it lasted. Part of playing in a &quot;living and breathing world&quot; means that things are going to change from time to time. We meant no harm but only wanted to create a lasting impression on players as they head to Northrend to defeat the Lich King. The Lich King's goals (as you will soon learn) are to turn the Horde and Alliance not only on one another, but on their own kind as well. I think the plague truly demonstrated this firsthand.<br />
<br />
So it looks like a cure has finally been found… for now.<br />
<br />
Thank you for participating in our most memorable event to date… for better or for…. brrrrrrraaaaaains… <br />
<br />
Couple of other important notes:<br />
The scourge invasion will continue for a few more days.<br />
The prologue event is not over! More to come!!<br />
The Karazhan boss will be up for approximately another week still<br />
We increased the respawn rate of the Necropoli<br />
Zombie cure should kick in by around noon PST</div></div><hr />

I'm hoping they have learned to better protect newb areas for the future. I tried creating an alt and...yeah, I picked a poor time, clearly. I can't imagine how much it must have sucked for people just starting the game for the first time.</div></div><hr />

Instant might have been ok as it would have given people time to gun down the little jihadist wannabees blowing themselves up in the AH.<br />
<br />
And you want to see real QQ? Try cleansing one of them with 2 seconds left on their timer or stunning them before they can explode. Talk about taking things way too serious.</div></div><hr />

But it is far from ending. <br />
in the next few days we'll see loads of scourge attack cities and eventually loads of elites and a ?? boss to deal with. Does it end there? No<br />
Then we go into wotlk and defeat the Lich king. Thats when it ends.</div></div><hr />

Hell yeah! We can sit in one place looking at virtual items that will be even MORE useless in two weeks with the release of the expansion! Even though you already could have done that if you had made an AH alt in Exodar/Silvermoon like smart people did :D<br />

People could really use that &quot;common sense&quot; too when someone tries to enjoy the event trying to save their cities... tons of QQ about &quot;you're ruining my fun!&quot;, &quot;stop cleansing you stupid casual&quot;, &quot;stop grief me!&quot; when I kill them as zombies or cleanse their victims (don't even bother on cleansing players since it's hard now, prefer to let them turn into zombies and KILL them! hahahaha).<br />

Poor implementation FTL.

I never said it would last for two weeks. I said the event hadn't reached it's climax yet, and yes, I do believe there was at least another day or two with phases we'll never get to see now.</div></div><hr />

Ha, nah. I don't QQ to Blizz for any reason unless it's a major glitch, like the enitre Gbank going empty in two mintues. Rare glitch, but it was fixed.<br />

Couldn't, when the zombie army got huge, it just lead to massive disconnects lol.<br />

<br />
Instant might have been ok as it would have given people time to gun down the little jihadist wannabees blowing themselves up in the AH.<br />
<br />
And you want to see real QQ? Try cleansing one of them with 2 seconds left on their timer or stunning them before they can explode. Talk about taking things way too serious.<br />

WAT, yer mama! You're killing vendors, you're killing city guards (making raids easier), you're killing quest contacts, STFU, if i could throw you in the Great Forge i would. &quot;Stop killing my zombie form, noob!&quot; &quot;Sorry, all i hear is RAH RAH RAH BRAINS.&quot; [clamps him on ignore, shoots him again]<br />
<br />
Couple of issues<br />
1)Plagued rats and roaches didn't do anything unless you shot at them. Maybe they did something from the zombie POV, anyone see something i didn't? Shooting them maybe shouldn't have given you Zombie-itis,too.<br />
2)I can't fight zombified PC's in Shatt? Really, the Aldor are so fixated on not having Horde on Alliance fights that they are willing to let Shatt be turned into a disaster area? Yeah, i know, the summoned ones can be fought and killed. <br />
3)Make Shadows of Doom work in raid mode<br />
4)Maybe increase the spawn rate for necropolis Doing that thanks.<br />
<br />
Other than that, good stuff all around.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can take a portal from Shatt to IF and...aw hell.&quot; [Steels himself as he leaps through the portal]</div></div><hr />

Infect a few toons with the plague and log out, wait a few months into WOTLK and get a zombie raid together.<br />
Hide and infect eachother and run rampart trough any capital as lvl 80 zombies owning those lvl 75 guards!<br />

I'm not sure, but I think the cure would &quot;fix&quot; all logged out players too... I thought of that too :)<br />
<br />
Also, the zombie infection part of the world event is over... not the whole event. We found a cure for the plague, but I'm sure we'll get a LOT more thrown at us over the next few weeks. Hell, we still have those giant floating citadels over all our major towns, that's only slightly ominous :P</div></div><hr />

oh no ? <br />
from org you take the zep to grom gol then fly from there or you can fly to ratchet and take the boat from there.<br />

from uc you take the zeppelin to grom grol or just fly down but that will take longer.<br />

from tb you can just fly to ratchet take boat or to orgrimmar and take zeppelin.<br />

no quick way ? i just showed you 3-4 ways that all are quick and takes the same time to get to stonard to then get thru to outlands and that is a poor reason to not go to the other cities if one is being overun.<br />

You can't talk to those guys, BUT they have been selling strange things since the beginning of the Invasion - you don't have to have finished the corresponding quest, but it's apparently intended lore-wise that you go tell those people about their loved/lost ones, and they are glad to know about their fate and share some food and drink with you.<br />
Try eating/drinking that though ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
imba event, i hope they give us more of that</div></div><hr />

If you weren't smart enough to take your gear off when you zombied... you deserve the bill. Stupidity has a price.</div></div><hr />

Seriously if you hanged around high population areas with zombies and expected you won't get infected you deserved it. Lol @ people threatening to quit WoW if this event didn't end.</div></div><hr />

These events are a welcome injection to the normal run of daily life in WoW imo....again...well done guys! ;D</div></div><hr />

This kind of &quot;diffrent&quot; is always a good thing to have imo, so please give us more ;).</div></div><hr />
