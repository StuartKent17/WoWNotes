The PTR Patch 4.0.6 Patch Notes (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/149669/public-test-realm-patch-406-notes-updated-jan-24) have been updated once again with a couple of interesting changes to dungeons and classes.<br />
<br />
Guilds<br />
<br />
The guild reward Armadillo Pup (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/89670/armadillo-pup/) now requires revered faction instead of exalted.<br />
The guild faction requirement on the Guild Herald (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/92398/guild-herald/) has been lowered to Revered reputation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons &amp; Raids<br />
<br />
Level-85 dungeon bosses in Lost City of the Tol'Vir, Grim Batol, and Halls of Origination now drop 30 Justice Points each when killed.<br />
The daily Random Dungeon reward on normal difficulty has been increased to 140 Justice Points, up from 70.<br />
Players no longer need to discover Cataclysm dungeon entrances in order to access them via the Dungeon Finder.<br />
<br />

<br />
Rejuvenation (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/774/rejuvenation/) is now trained at level 3, down from level 8. In addition, its mana cost is now 20% of base mana.<br />
<br />
<br />
Balance<br />
<br />
Moonkin Form (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/24858/moonkin-form/) now grants 15% damage reduction instead of increased armor. In addition, shapeshifting in or out of this form now breaks roots. Note this is not stated in the tooltip.<br />
<br />
<br />
Feral<br />
<br />
Blood in the Water (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/80319/blood-in-the-water/): Timing on this effect has been improved so that Ferocious Bite (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/22568/ferocious-bite/) will immediately refresh Rip (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/1079/rip/), rather than be slightly delayed (which gave a chance for the Rip to expire despite being refreshed).<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/273-Paladin) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..paladin) / Beta Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1670-Paladin-Cataclysm))<br />
<br />
Divine Light (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/82326/divine-light/) mana cost has been increased by approximately 10%.<br />
Flash of Light (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/19750/flash-of-light/) mana cost has been increased by approximately 10%.<br />
Holy Light (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/635/holy-light/) mana cost has been increased by approximately 10%.<br />
Lay on Hands (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/633/lay-on-hands/) now causes Forbearance (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/25771/forbearance/) on the target. It used to only cause it when cast on the paladin. This was an old design from when Divine Protection (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/498/divine-protection/) caused Forbearance and the paladin didn't want to prevent a tank from using their defensive cooldown.<br />
Lay on Hands cannot be a critical effect and will not be affected by most abilities which modify healing (such as Beacon of Light (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/53563/beacon-of-light/)). In addition, Lay on Hands is no longer on the global cooldown.<br />
<br />
<br />
Holy<br />
<br />
Aura Mastery (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/31821/aura-mastery/): This ability no longer increases the benefit granted by Crusader Aura (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/32223/crusader-aura/).<br />
<br />
<br />
Protection<br />
<br />
Eternal Glory (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/87164/eternal-glory/): The chance to not consume Holy Power from this talent now also applies to not consuming the clearcasting effect generated by Divine Purpose (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/86172/divine-purpose/).<br />
<br />

<br />
Mind Blast (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/8092/mind-blast/) now does 18% more damage than Mind Spike (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/73510/mind-spike/).<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/275-Rogue) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..rogue) / Beta Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1122-Rogue-Cataclysm))<br />
Combat<br />
<br />
Blade Flurry (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/13877/blade-flurry/) is now a toggle that can be turned off by pressing the button again. In addition, this ability no longer has a fixed duration, but will go on cooldown for 10 seconds after being canceled (similar to Stealth (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/1784/stealth/)). In addition, Blade Flurry now reduces energy generation by 30% while active, up from 20%.<br />

<br />
Healing Rain (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/73920/healing-rain/) now has a 40-yard radius, up from 30, to be consistent with other shaman heals.<br />
<br />
<br />
Elemental<br />
<br />
Elemental Overload (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/77222/elemental-overload/) (Mastery) procs of Lightning Bolt (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/403/lightning-bolt/) or Chain Lightning (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/421/chain-lightning/) can now generate Rolling Thunder (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/88764/rolling-thunder/) charges.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Affliction<br />
<br />
Soul Swap (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/86121/soul-swap/) can no longer be dispelled (the aura given to the warlock between swapping).<br />
<br />

Single-Minded Fury (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/81099/single-minded-fury/) bonus has been increased to 20%, up from 15%.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
The PvP Balance druid 4-piece set bonus effect (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/46832/sudden-eclipse/) has been increased to 20 Solar Energy and 13 Lunar Energy, up from 5 and 13. The effect will also now be more intelligent at choosing whether to give the druid Lunar or Solar Energy (it checks the Balance Power to determine which to give depending on which energy is higher at the time).<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests &amp; Creatures<br />
Tol Barad<br />
<br />
Rusty Rifles will now spawn more frequently at Farson Keep.<br />
Players should now always receive 6 daily quests in Tol Barad Peninsula as intended, rather than sometimes only getting 5.</div></div><hr />

Don't mind him, he does this on every news post. It's his own way of venting I think.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I don't really mind the Holy nerfs. Our healing was too powerful anyway, so a way to limit that is to increase mana costs, of course.<br />

* Moonkin Form now grants 15% damage reduction instead of increased armor. In addition, shapeshifting in or out of this form now breaks roots. Note this is not stated in the tooltip.<br />
<br />
<br />
So just to make sure I get this straight .. You're going to allow a class that can do massive damage with ranged spells to break roots, but not a melee class that needs to be up on their target?<br />
<br />
Where's the logic? :(</div></div><hr />

There's nothing wrong with nerfing Paladins.. They were obviously the best healer in the game right now... There's no reason to buff every other class just to be where Paladins are.</div></div><hr />

I think it helped when groups wiped.<br />
We knew where the dungeons were.<br />
<br />
Actually, while leveling my 3rd toon to 85 I purposely skipped discovering Throne of Tides. I wasn't really a fan of it, there was no quest line, and the XP gain didn't feel as good as BRC or Stonecore. I actually really enjoyed doing random dungeons and knowing I couldn't get ToT. What I'm thinking is they're removing the need to discover the dungeons for exactly that reason. People were avoiding discovering dungeons they just didn't care for and they could safely do the daily random knowing they would only get dungeons they cared to do :)</div></div><hr />

If blizz wants people to do optionals, they need to make them not optional.<br />
<br />
Read it again. It's *normals*, has nothing to do with VP queuing.<br />
It's the lvl 85 normals. They are allowing JP from those in addition to the first random, essentially just removing the time-gate on gearing to advance from Normals to Heroics.<br />

* Moonkin Form now grants 15% damage reduction instead of increased armor. In addition, shapeshifting in or out of this form now breaks roots. Note this is not stated in the tooltip.<br />
<br />
<br />
So just to make sure I get this straight .. You're going to allow a class that can do massive damage with ranged spells to break roots, but not a melee class that needs to be up on their target?<br />
<br />
Where's the logic? :(<br />
<br />
wow warriors really hit rock bottom when they are compaining about moonkin in pvp....<br />
<br />
they never get to actually do massive ranged damage because they have to cast 6+ spells just to do 100% of their potential otherwise their damage is 50% of most casters.<br />

<br />
To make more mana management in the hands of the player by using Divine Plea/Concentration Potions during downtime instead of just passive.<br />
<br />
Heck at least we can use Concentration Potions during our mana cooldowns. Priests have to derp around channeling a spell and don't usually have the benefit of using the better potions.<br />
<br />
I like these changes (and I main healadin). It will barely affect me raiding considering I end fights with at least 10-20% mana now usually. I'll be closer to OOM, but big deal. Maybe people won't go &quot;zomg holy so OP&quot; now.</div></div><hr />

Yeah... no. Healing is meant to be difficult. When a class goes above what is considered proper, they get nerfed back down. Don't say you hadn't seen it coming, it's a well deserved nerf.<br />

I play a ret pally and as it stands, a single flash of light takes off a rather large chunk of my mana bar and heals for very little. There are plenty of times when non-holy paladins have to heal themselves, and this increase is going to seriously hurt us... in dungeons, most of the time the healer is too busy with tank heals or undergeared to cover the splash dmg melee are taking... later in raids, you need to be self-sufficient, which means heal yourself if/when you can do the raid healers can conserve mana. Even in PVP (which I rarely do) if you have to heal yourself during/after a fight, you can kiss your mana bar goodbye cause you will run out LONG before your back to full health. Why not just decrease the mana reduction of one of the Holy talents? sounds like a simple fix to me, then ret/prot wont get an increase in spell cost for our already tiny mana pools.<br />
<br />
As to the LoH nerf.. cause it cant be seen as anything else... Blizz, are you F*n retarded?! LoH was always fine the way it was. Then you had to start screwing around with it.. Oh it HAS to cause Forbearance or it'd be OP... Oh now we will take it off FB, but only when cast on someone else.. Oh wait, now you cant use it unless you have every other CD up, and cant use it in conjuction with anything else EVER... Oh wait, we changed our minds again.. now it cant crit, cant be affected by +healing or +healing talents... what's next.. Can only be cast if the target is below 1% health, is standing in fire, has 8 dots, and his armor is all broke?!? Seriously LEAVE IT ALONE.. it worked fine from the get-go, it's a raid saver pretty much ANYTIME its used (kinda like DI was.. but blizz wanted to screw with what worked once again) and really.. is it sooooo terrible that a paladin can heal himself fully once every 10 minutes in pvp? that's still several death you can cause him before he can pop it again.<br />

it's okay to buff the random normal award to 140 JP though.. but why let the bosses reward JP on normal?!?!<br />
Farm some HC's to get em.. and then buff the random HC Reward to 140 VP too instead or around 100.. It takes AGES to get VP's if you are not in a raiding guild<br />
<br />
Thats cause you don't need raiding gear if you don't raid, you need heroic gear to do heroics.<br />
<br />
So if you don't raid you shouldn't have that gear or at least have a harder time getting it then the people who put in the time and effort in to get said gear. Long story short if you want the raiding gear faster start raiding, otherwise you don't need it anyway.</div></div><hr />

Agreed. First you make my shaman such a pain in the arse to play I re-roll pally<br />
and now you guys go and up all our healing spells.<br />
&quot;# Divine Light mana cost has been increased by approximately 10%.&quot;<br />
is an absolute retarded spell to up the mana cost of. 40% FORTY PERCENT with what you<br />
want to do that redonkulous! <br />
You guys seriously couldn't just nerfed Protector of the Innocent I was happy with that I could live with that<br />
but seriously blizzard...seriously...this is just dumb. Hope this changes or gives me even more of a reason<br />
to rather just not play at all anymore.:(<br />
<br />

<br />
The nerf to paladins is more of a balancing thing, they can spam all they want and have almost unlimited mana regeneration unless you're totally healing wrong, you probably won't even notice this small increase in actual game play anyway.<br />
<br />
Resto shaman buff, seems nice so far.<br />
Elemental shaman buff to lava burst and now making mastery a more desirable stat, lovely!<br />
<br />
Warlock devour nerf -&gt; Much needed, since it negates some mechanics on raid bosses in PVE (think remedy instantly getting devoured). And the cooldown was abnormally fast for a spell to be allowed to be on auto-cast. this will make warlocks actually THINK before they devour in PvE and PvP, (IE : eating poly's off them the moment it hits when they could just stay in the full poly)<br />
<br />
Feral druids -&gt; Even with the wave of nerfs, it just normalizes your dps, from an over the top amount of bleed damage to more standard burst or sustained dps, i don't see whats wrong overall your damage output should be the same in PvE, PvP might changed slightly, which is fine atm a druid can bleed a person to death.<br />
<br />
Warrior nerfs/buffs -&gt; Most the people who cry that the nerfs will destroy the class, in this case its not true, sure it 'changes' your pvp stances (outlook) slightly, but if you look closely in arena warriors are shining, i bet even with these nerfs they'll still be going strong. They have a lot more utility now too with heroic leap, throw down, etc. Either just fix your rotation etc, and re-learn the new changes or just QQing and complaining the class sucks when in essence its probably just you.<br />
<br />
Mage talk -&gt; Yep their burst in PvP is out of this world, their control with ring of frost novas and crap is really stupid however, all of it is dispellable with no punishment compared to say a UA lock stacking dots + fears, and mages atm has poor survival (unless i've only been seeing bad mages on wowmovies -&gt; arena vids)<br />
<br />
I personally think, DKs are the strongest melee class in arena at the moment, steady to crazy burst, a lot of interrupts and utility, so many defensive cooldowns and self heals, but not impossible to handle, hopefully they will get balanced soon.<br />
<br />
And people using Paragon/Method's recount to determine which healers are OP and which are shit, which DPS are OP and which are shit, its a poor indicator, they are simply trying to min/max according to encounter, class stacking for world first races, it doesn't necessarily mean the other healers/dps classes are completely useless, its just they're slightly weaker at a glance.<br />
<br />
TL;DR : Its called balancing, not nerfing your class so you can cry without any thought to why the nerfs appeared.</div></div><hr />

You're being ignorant if you think that Holy Paladins are balanced in either PvP or PvE. They're so far ahead of everyone else. There is a reason they make up almost 80% of the top 10 HPS charts for current raid encounters. And its not BALANCE.</div></div><hr />

Yes, because devour is an autocast that costs no mana. It requires no thought. This is balanced against other classes which have to select the spell to cast, and dispose of 3k+ mana.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Players no longer need to discover Cataclysm dungeon entrances in order to access them via the Dungeon Finder.&quot;<br />
None of them are phased, just fly to them to discover them or (even better) get two guild mates to summon you to the stone so you have them discovered. If 2 of your guild don't have all the dungeons by now, you need to recruit (1 or 2) more people! :-) It's what the rest of us did.

Paladin &quot;greater heal&quot; after patch 7800 mana.<br />
<br />
Am i the only one smelling the hurt?<br />
I admit that paladins do last longer than the other healers. but in no way is paladins out of place when it comes to raiding vs priests and druids when it comes to throughput. My guild is 11/12 and only in a few encounters do i as a Hpaladin have mana left at the end of a fight where i spend my cooldowns right and get the most out of every single mana break i can fetch. Making mana cost higher per spell does not = less paladin dominance, just = more wiping because mana will be even more of a struggle.<br />
<br />
Now im not a Druid expert but with the restodruids going around with the feral talent which gives them 15% max mana and a resto talent which gives them 6% int. we can surely make that to atleast be true that resto druids got 115%+ mana from int. Holy paladins next patch effectivly got 90% mana from int because of the nerf. Why? obviuslly healing is too hard for druids, priests and shamans so they decide to bring down paladins to the same shit instead of buffing the other healers to the same &quot;op&quot; level.<br />
And of pvp? do we really need to open the hate thread from healers where a dps can do 60k damage in 2 globals where as a healer can max heal 40k in 2sec cast time? i mean seriuslly... this game is not fun in pvp anymore as a healer and now they're trying their best not to make pve any better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Remember Oculus? People left the instance in droves until it was nerfed into oblivion. Apparently Blizzard was unhappy with people purposefully not discovering instances to avoid running them. That was not Blizzard's intent so now it appears they're going back to the old way. So the removal of dungeon discovery can likely be blamed on those purposefully avoiding discovering select instances.<br />
<br />
Perhaps to make sure people can get back to the instance Blizzard should add a trail only the dead can see that leads them back to the instance entrance. Or perhaps, for the ultra lazy, just put the graveyard right at the instance entrance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ret Pallys have seen a hard, hard hit. As it is I can barely survive fights, and take the same amount of damage as my mage. It's like armor doesn't mean squat for absorption, and not it will cost me as Ret more mana to heal myself in PVE fights that seem to eat away at my health greatly. It's the reason I've gone to my mage. Less hits.<br />
<br />
Things had gotten better, it seemed, but after taking a break due to the holidays things had become suddenly worse. It's like they went &quot;OOPs, we made the Pally leveling/DPS spec bearable, lets fix that.&quot;<br />
<br />
One thing I don't get is this: How is losing 50-75% health each fight a challenge? Give me things to interupt, move out of the way of, etc. Those are challenging. Straight up stopping after every fight is rediculous.<br />
<br />
Killing things really fast is the only way to not take lots of damage, but that's all crit. I can build up the three HP to slam a target, but between time and random chance I take too much damage. I even checked my build agains the Elitist Jerks one. It was spot on for a Paladin, and so was my rotation.<br />

<br />
Alts. They wanted people to have to discover the entrances for the main characters so we wouldn´t have IC5 issues (where people died, then couldn´t find their way back). Once you´ve discovered the entrances on your main, there is no need for your alts to actually have to discover them.... you, as a player, already know where they are.</div></div><hr />

Paladin &quot;greater heal&quot; after patch 7800 mana.<br />
<br />
Am i the only one smelling the hurt?<br />
I admit that paladins do last longer than the other healers. but in no way is paladins out of place when it comes to raiding vs priests and druids when it comes to throughput. My guild is 11/12 and only in a few encounters do i as a Hpaladin have mana left at the end of a fight where i spend my cooldowns right and get the most out of every single mana break i can fetch. Making mana cost higher per spell does not = less paladin dominance, just = more wiping because mana will be even more of a struggle.<br />
<br />
Now im not a Druid expert but with the restodruids going around with the feral talent which gives them 15% max mana and a resto talent which gives them 6% int. we can surely make that to atleast be true that resto druids got 115%+ mana from int. Holy paladins next patch effectivly got 90% mana from int because of the nerf. Why? obviuslly healing is too hard for druids, priests and shamans so they decide to bring down paladins to the same shit instead of buffing the other healers to the same &quot;op&quot; level.<br />
And of pvp? do we really need to open the hate thread from healers where a dps can do 60k damage in 2 globals where as a healer can max heal 40k in 2sec cast time? i mean seriuslly... this game is not fun in pvp anymore as a healer and now they're trying their best not to make pve any better.<br />
<br />
Holydins were too good. Don't blame the game for your own lack of skill if you could not match the better paladins and be as good and efficient as they are. If you're letting druids outheal and outmana you, you're doing something wrong.<br />
<br />
I dunno why people even bother crying, at all. Like that will change anything. Reroll the next FOTM if you must, and in the meanwhile, let the people of Blizzard balance the game. Your anonymous, uneducated cries on some forum about no longer being able to faceroll, be it as paladin, or whatever the heck else got nerfed (and this goes for the future too), will not make blizzard go teary for you and revert changes. Yes, I got nerfed too. I'll wait it out, and adjust myself to it. Do the same, but for for heaven's sake stop the tears.<br />
<br />
Edit: I'd like to add because just reading that quote pissed me off so much. It's players like this, I seriously, just don't play healers at all. Mana struggle causing wipes? No, tell your raid to learn to play and do the fight correctly, then mana is 1000% fine. Or just learn to use the right spells at the right time. In your case it's probably a combination of both. I just, seriously, all these cries about difficult heroics and healing being impossible and QQ more, I don't even know, I mean, yesterday I pugged some for the funs and met so many bad players blaming each other for the same mistakes, which they made over and over and over again, stop BLAMING the game, stop blaming your class, get your act together, and read up on your class.

I am a holy pally, and have been one since vanilla.<br />
<br />
I believe pally's are strong healers, but the majority of the player base is not Paragon, or other high end bleeding edge progression guilds. Honestly, if you're just progressing through normal mode raids and you're getting &quot;dominated&quot; by pallys (lawl@healingmetersanyways) then honestly- you're doing something wrong. I see this a lot, frankly a lot of healers suck now and it leads into a mentality of &quot;well it's not my fault I'm a bad healer, it's because holy pallies are OP and I obviously can't compete in normal modes when one class is that strong&quot;.<br />
<br />
I get it- holy pally numbers in very visible top end min-maxing guilds were high. If you play a perfect game and the pally plays a perfect game, the pally has an edge (if you care about meters, i'd say 5%-10% healing down over #2 in 3heal 10mans, can't attest to 25's). Can you still do the normal mode fight w/o that holy pally? Absolutely.<br />
<br />
To get through your normal-mode bosses that 90% of the player base is on right now you should be able to be competitive against holy pallies. How much did you honestly hear about people calling for healing nerfs in wotlk? Now, since it's more of a challenge healers are frustrated and pallies have become the scape goat for why you suck.<br />
<br />
Pallies have only been nerfed since cata, and I really wish blizz would get it right once and for all so that I can settle into my playstyle. Unfortunately, this isn't really going to fix much even if it makes it live.<br />
<br />
Word of advice: healers do what you can to get your house in order. Blizz will keep changing numbers, but you'll be much better off improving your game than waiting on nerfs for your &quot;competition&quot;. Oh and Crusader Aura blizz? Really? Really?

This patch needs a few more tweaks like nerf to Warriors and DK's (Death's Advocate is completly unnecesary for a mele class that can do huge damage at range as well). About the info we got today:<br />
<br />
-Druid changes:<br />
Good news! Moonkin change is making them simmilar to Mages. Casters need a way to run away from mele. Besides Moonkin was the weekest class in the pool from the PvP point of view.<br />
<br />
- Paladin<br />
Good changes as well. Looking how you could never run H-Pala out of mana was crazy! Stay in line and if it's a problem to you, then you should look at your rotation and spend more time learning your class.<br />
<br />
- Rogue<br />
Combat will have it comeback with this patch, I'm still to see live numbers before we can say if Blizzard managed this task or they have failed.<br />
<br />
- Shammy<br />
Good changes. Ele needed some help, we will see how it goes.<br />
<br />
- Lock<br />
They were silent kings of Cata. They should be more in line with this patch. Oh, and dont whine about Devour change! This spell was amazing. No Mana cost, no attention needed, fire and forget! Look at your class objectively and you will admit this was na needed change.<br />
<br />
- Warrior<br />
Still need some nerfs. Mobility nerf was well deserved. With cata Warriors received Throwdown and Heroic Leap, Warbringer in this environment was too much.<br />
Furry still needs PvP nerfs as they can 100 -&gt; 0 people in 4 sec. <br />
<br />
Overall I can't wait for the patch to land! It will be one of the best periods of WoW! And don't you people whine about PvE. PvE content was cleared! If you can't do it, then it's you and your team skill problem not that the skills are getting nerfed.</div></div><hr />

You sir, have no idea what balancing means. Its not about beeing able to do stuff without pallies. Its about pallies getting choosen over other classes, because they are stronger.<br />

I wasn't really a fan of it, there was no quest line, and the XP gain didn't feel as good as BRC or Stonecore. I actually really enjoyed doing random dungeons and knowing I couldn't get ToT. What I'm thinking is they're removing the need to discover the dungeons for exactly that reason. People were avoiding discovering dungeons they just didn't care for and they could safely do the daily random knowing they would only get dungeons they cared to do :)<br />
<br />
I think there is a lot of truth to that.... when I started leveling my worgen druid past 80, I started off just discovering BRC... and was running randoms every day with only that one instance discovered. I was &quot;randomly&quot; getting the very same instance every time. I did this on purpose (ive had some bad experiences with people in throne) and im sure many other people do similar. For example, if you hated GB, you would only have to not discover it - and you could queue for randoms and never have to set foot in there. Kinda goes against the spirit of a random. So my feeling is you are correct, this is a big part of why they have removed (so soon after implimenting) the requirement to discover the entrances.<br />

why on earth are they buffing the amount of JP for the normal dungeons?!?.. geez..<br />
it's okay to buff the random normal award to 140 JP though.. but why let the bosses reward JP on normal?!?!<br />
Farm some HC's to get em.. and then buff the random HC Reward to 140 VP too instead or around 100.. It takes AGES to get VP's if you are not in a raiding guild<br />
<br />
Just because you dont find it so, doesnt mean that others arent finding it hard to gear up for heroics. This change makes it easier for them to do so. Before you turn around and say... &quot;If you cant gear for heroics, then leave the game QQ&quot;, pay attention to what you are saying about you finding it hard from heroics to gear up for raiding maybe. All you are saying is &quot;Waaaaaah dont give people who cant gear for heroics extra points, instead give them to those who are gearing for raids!&quot;. Gearing for raids SHOULD be harder than gearing for heroics.<br />

Getting gear for things you didn't actually do, welcome to the wrath token system.<br />
<br />
How is this getting gear for things that you didnt actually do? Boss down = JP. Where is the &quot;didnt actually do&quot; there? If you dont need this buff to gearing up for heroics then great, but in that case this doesnt affect you, move along please.<br />
<br />
---------- Post added 2011-01-25 at 10:00 AM ----------<br />

<br />
I would hardly call 346 great gear, its still painful to try and buy 359 without raiding so I dont see an issue with the changes.<br />
<br />
Of course, this change does make it easier for those that are having problems with heroics the opportunity to stockpile a full supply of JP for when 4.1 comes out and 359 gear comes down to JP. Then people that cant manage heroics can suddenly start getting 359 epics and faceroll them.<br />
<br />
I can see arguments for and against this in that context. My own view is this is fine... IF... Blizzard introduce some new instances later that are harder than the present ones. I strongly suspect they will based on two factors: 1, they only made available a very small amount of 5mans this expansion. FAR less than in wrath. 2, they already started doing this in wrath. ToC5 was a step up in difficulty from the older wrath instances, then again the ICC5 instances were harder still. I remember HoR heroic being rather hard when it came out (at least I found it hard to heal), but the older heroics had already become really faceroll. So, allow people to get the 359 gear by stockpiling JP....... and then later the next level..... but keep bringing out harder and harder instances to make the &quot;cutting edge&quot; content (both 5 man and raids) challenging for the majority of players. (yes I know for some players this is already faceroll - but for most is isnt).<br />

So what exactly was the point of having to discover instance entrances? One patch later and it's removed completely.<br />
<br />
The point was so that people could at least know where the entrances were so they could run back after a wipe instead of &quot;res me, I dont know the way back&quot; (yes, as a healer I have heard that a LOT of times from people in pugs). IMO it was a great idea to make sure people knew where the instances actually were. However I think they didnt forsee the use people would put it to: not discovering the instances they didnt want to run.</div></div><hr />

Been bored for a while now in cata anyways but if the devour nerf goes through on top of the other totally unneeded lock nerfs I'm seriously considering a long break from this game. There comes a time when it's just not fun anymore to see your favorite class get nerfed time and time again, especially when it's not warranted. Devour magic, really?<br />
<br />
Most people would say that locks are ok now, not underpowered or overpowered. At the same time the class that need a nerf the most (mage) stays untouched. I also play my DK a lot and Dks DON'T need a buff, if you get kited as an uh or frost dk you need to revisit your spell book. This just shows that Blizz is totally out of touch with pvp right now.<br />
<br />
We will see on patch day but a long break and checking back in a few months seem a very likely scenario for me now.</div></div><hr />

I heal raids on my paladin because they won't let me roll ret because it is so weak, but why this. WHY. ALL MY RAGE<br />
<br />
Where do you think the large health pools came from? Where do you think the healer nerfs came from? Where do you think about every change they made in Cata came from? This expansion was all about getting the precious PvP back so developers can claim everyone does it. Its to make their Arena tournaments less of a joke. The claim to challenge healers in content was a lie to cover up that the new health pools, changes to who can and cannot cleanse what, and the costs of healing, were to make Arena games more &quot;fun&quot;. It certainly was not about improving the PvE experience. If anything the new health pools presented them with a major problem in their instance designs. To overcome their monty hall loot giveaways they cranked health.<br />
<br />
All in all, they went monty hall with loot, ever escalating dps/sp to the point they broke the game. Then to cover up for it they crank health pools of players which exaggerated another problem, player characters became too good for their encounter designers. Hence quadruple the costs of healing, add a lot of gratuitous damage to PvE encounters, and such. All so their precious Arena can stop being a burst joke</div></div><hr />

<br />
It doesnt make ret better it simply means some palas who were asked to be holy while it was OP (sorry, the better of the 4 healers) can go back to there original roles now.. I am presuming some of his raiders were playing Holy just to get a raid spot - I have seen a fair few peeps completely change role over the past months.</div></div><hr />

I think its to prevent people from not discovering certain instances on purpose (stonecore says hai) for not having to deal with them in their daily random. <br />
<br />
Now if someone doesnt find an entrance to an instance in ~2 minutes after releasing make it possible to kick him even if theres a kick cooldown applied!</div></div><hr />

<br />
To reduce mage control, we are discussing reducing the duration of Frost Nova and Ring of Frost<br />
<br />
<br />
We’re also looking at crowd control, interrupts, and self-healing in PvP. It’s possible we’ll reduce the durations of some crowd control effects, especially the area effect ones, and decrease the duration of interrupts.<br />
<br />
... still no change to Frost Mage, who keep their controls all but untouched, despite endless feedback from all community (including Frost mage themselves) (interrupts however, where nerfed as announced).<br />
<br />
However, this...<br />
<br />
<br />
Frost mage damage might be too low<br />

Glad I don't even do randoms anymore. I got tired of telling people where pit, forge, and halls are in WOTLK. Even near the end of WOTLK. Already I have had to tell people where Deadmines is. Then I ask them are you Ebay?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pantelija</div><div class="date">2011-01-25, 09:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, because devour is an autocast that costs no mana. It requires no thought. This is balanced against other classes which have to select the spell to cast, and dispose of 3k+ mana.<br />
U dont understand , it wasnt auto cast i was pointing out but how it went on a high cd while other purges/dispells still have 0 (every decent warlock doesnt have it on auto cast but macroed)<br />
<br />
<br />
Agreed. Auto-spam devour from free was rediculous. When you're a holy paladin in a 2v2 vs an affliction warlock you just give the hell up on blessings because the pet will just eat the damn thing every 8 seconds.<br />
Yet again as i said it wasnt the auto cast that was the problem it is the high cd change , nobody cares about auto cast because 90% of them have it macroed<br />
<br />
<br />
* Devour (Felhunter) cooldown has been increased to 20 seconds, up from 8. Devour is no longer able to be auto-cast.<br />
<br />
This because Blizzard decided to listen to 38 pages of QQ.. By a Holy Paladin.. (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/1827257627?page=3)<br />
<br />
As a Warlock I'm completelly in favor of the auto-cast removal but, seriously, 20 seconds?! Are you shitting me? Every dispel is spammable and now ours gets its CD increased by 12 seconds? Get lost.<br />
My thoughts exactly , beta change that removed self dispell portion and gave it to imp was stupid enough but cd change is just beyond stupid now ...<br />
<br />
It seems Cata is becoming Wotlk 2.0 , cattering to majority QQ which is kind of sad , i had high hopes for this expansion PvP wise</div></div><hr />
