Next Connected Realms<br />
As a part of our ongoing Connected Realms implementation, we will be working toward connecting our next pair of realms, Black Dragonflight and Skullcrusher – we’ll provide another update once we’ve finalized the date. We will also update this thread with any additional information that becomes available. Please be aware that as a part of the process, realm times may change to align better with each other.<br />
<br />
We are currently evaluating additional realm connections and plan to provide a more complete schedule at a future point in time.<br />
<br />
For more information on Connected Realms, please read the preview blog post here.<br />
<br />
I know a lot of you are looking forward to having your realm connected (or even just knowing when and who you'll be connected to), but keep in mind that these initial connections are to test the various steps and results of what is a very involved and complicated process. We need to make these initial connections, nail down the processes, find and resolve any issues we run into, etc. before finalizing next steps as the results of the tests will have a direct impact on how and when we make all future connections. The realms connected thus far were chosen specifically to help identify potential issues, and not necessarily because they would benefit the most from a connection.<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Raid Finder<br />
can you comment on SOO increased LFR drop rate (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3411-Patch-5-4-Drop-Rates-SoO-Progression-Upcoming-Pet-Changes-Blue-Posts-Fan-Art). Are these statistics accurate?<br />
We view LFR each tier as having a finite lifespan whether you finish your gear or not, so we might as well give you the gear. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384847696239943680))<br />
<br />
Has there ever been any consideration to personal rewards for acing mechanics on individual LFR fights?<br />
Yes. We would have to be really, really smart with such a design however for what are probably obvious reasons. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384848216258142208))<br />
<br />
You made a comment in a interview that's helping feed the fire, and people are making assumptions about your intentions.<br />
It would probably be more like LFR requires ilevel 500 OR a Proving Ground Silver Medal, or maybe Silver + ilevel 450 or whatever. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384837040879067136))<br />
<br />
Flex Raiding<br />
Greg, any thoughts on making Flex loot tradeable in guild groups? Got a few items I wish had gone elsewhere. Thanks!<br />
Long term it's probably a requirement, but we currently don't have a way to drop more loot for larger groups. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384849288632614912))<br />
<br />
Can you give us any idea of Flex participation relative to normal? I'm excited to see if it's as highly popular as it seems.<br />
It's as or more popular than normal and growing. It makes sense that flex could grow to be far more popular than normal. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384844799473250305))<br />

Find Your Friends at the BlizzCon Meeting Stone<br />
BlizzCon is a great place to meet up with friends, guildmates, and other cohorts, and this year we’re providing you with the perfect space right on the show floor. Located between Halls B and C, The Meeting Stone is an easy and recognizable gathering point as it will literally contain a giant life-sized Meeting Stone. No more hiking upstairs to squint at each other in a well-lit room, this year you’ll be able to meet up at this central location and be just a scant few meters away from the main stage, demo areas, and other attractions.<br />
<br />
The Blizzard Community Team and other staff members will be on-hand to interact with those summoned to the Meeting Stone (and to mitigate potential corpse camping). We’ll be putting together a schedule to reserve space and times for larger groups, to also be displayed at the event.<br />
Please visit the new Meeting Stone forum (http://us.battle.net/blizzcon/en/forum/11216403/) if you’re interested in arranging a specific time for your group meetup. <br />

They tend not to release videos until at least one other guild has made the kill as well. And they're still the only ones at 14/14 in their raid size.<br />

<br />
I am already suffering with a game breaking bug. It's called playing a mmo without other people to play with due to playing on a dead server. Really, they need to stop the feet dragging and get this done. It's really a joke at this point, they have over a 100 servers that need to be merged and they are going at a rate that this may finish up sometime in 2015 or 16.<br />
<br />
Also the realms they are picking is funny. Two dead realms merged is not very helpful. They need to be doing four or more at a time so that the new realms get to be at least half the population of a Area 52 or Stromrage. With the process they are doing, you will just have two realms merged both dead and little to no change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can still play. If your character somehow went missing during the merge, there'd be hell to pay. The way I see it, they're doing it on 2 realms, fix any issues still standing, then do another 2, see if they've missed something and then fix that, and they they move on. Unless something serious crops up with the 2 new realms being connected, I doubt we'll see as long a timespan before the next one is announced.<br />

Again, once it's done it cannot be undone. Ever. It makes sense for them to only merge 2 at a time and see how that plays out before they attach more.<br />

think its good that its going slowly cause it means its not gona cause any major issues, prob a tricky thing to connect the realms like this and i atleast dont wannt servers that keeps crashing if they launch this way to soon cause of impatient player base...<br />

<br />
My guess is the rollout plan goes something like:<br />
<br />
- Connect 2 servers together.<br />
- Connect 2 servers together.<br />
- Add a 3rd server to 2 already connected.<br />
- Merge all 5 of those severs together.<br />
- Merge a dozen tiny servers together.<br />
- Continue merging servers until issues arise, or until all the servers of the same type are merged into a single mega server.<br />
<br />
Probably a month or two until they attempt to merge several small servers together.</div></div><hr />

Stop crying, this is a huge technical issue that NOBODY wants to see go wrong. It is funny that when Blizzard releases a patch and there is a tiny bug, there will be tons of people creating threads crying about it.. but when Blizzard takes their time and tests things ( and yes, this is ´testing´ it because there is no way they could test this on a PTR) then people come here and cry because it is taking so long.<br />
<br />
They did the first one a few weeks ago, there were a few issues with chat. They fixed those, and are now doing another test... and my guess is they will keep doing 1 test at a time until they do it without any issues.<br />
<br />
It is stupid to say 2017, I think anyone with half a brain knows it will speed up once they get a few more tests done.<br />

Four total realms after a month. What a total joke. They should either get this rolling as in now or give out free transfers to those on the dead realms. They shouldn't be asked to wait months after they have already waited so long for Blizzard to get over it's feet dragging.<br />
<br />
dragging it´s feet? oh... wait.. you mean ´testing things properly´ before applying a huge new technology that could potentially cripple every server if done wrong?<br />

<br />
Yes, because probably a dozen computer engineers, along with the people that run a billion dollar game obviously have not put as much thought into this after analyzing detailed data as some kid at home crying about it who has no data.<br />
<br />
And actually, two dead realms merged has been hugely successful for those realms. Ask players who play on them. The only issue is they had a few problems with chat that needed to be fixed.<br />
<br />
What kids don´t understand is this is a process they cannot test on PTR and probably not even internally. This is a big deal and something that has never been done in any other game. They are going to do 1 by 1 until they can do it without issues before they speed up the process. It will probably take a few months more.<br />
<br />
And I also am sure that their data indicates that as much as people cry about their ´dead realms´... that not many of them are actually going to quit because of it in the next 2-3 months, especially with all the new content in 5.4<br />

I never thought LFR was that terrible, but certainly there was opportunity for toxic players and the raids did feel a little too easy. But you are right, Flex is just so much better. Even if you PUG it with people from Openraid, there is just more a sense of teamwork and almost no chance for people being toxic, especially if you lead the group and check their ratings first. oqueue is a bit more hit-n-miss, I have gotten grouped with some jerks and others that only wanted to be carried.. probably because their is no rating system so it feels more anonymous<br />

Great to have friend to carry you because Flex group ask 525+ ilvl and don't me that all your alts have that ilevel. :p<br />
<br />
You are joking, right? Flex can easily be done at 500, especially with a group of friends.<br />
<br />
The reason people ask for 525 or whatever for PUGs is because they can.. There are usually so many DPS begging to join that the person running it can set the bar a bit higher. And when this all started, if you asked for 525 it showed that that person had done some signficant playing with that character and more than likely knew it well.<br />
<br />
But for friends.. the actual DPS checks for fights are very low, tank damage is low.. there are no real ´numbers´ that are hard to get, it is more about learning the fights, which friends and family will do better than pugs.<br />

My guess is the rollout plan goes something like:<br />
<br />
- Connect 2 servers together.<br />
- Connect 2 servers together.<br />
- Add a 3rd server to 2 already connected.<br />
- Merge all 5 of those severs together.<br />
- Merge a dozen tiny servers together.<br />
- Continue merging servers until issues arise, or until all the servers of the same type are merged into a single mega server.<br />
<br />
Probably a month or two until they attempt to merge several small servers together.<br />
<br />
I really think people are overstating how ´dead´ certain realms are. I doubt we will ever see more than 3 connected together. For their first test, they took 2 very dead realms and the new merged realm is very active now. I was amazed at how active the AH became etc. The other thing is that the amount of guilds who are raiding will grow faster than the overall population. just because most guilds are only need a few stragglers. For instance, Illidian probably has 4 times the amount of players as my server, but they probably have 30 times the number of guilds doing progression raiding. The same is true of the AH... the amount of items listed on the AH now is more than just the sum of the two servers before the merger because the activity breeds activity.<br />
<br />
The real problem that they won´t be able to overcome is that on almost all of those very low population pvp servers, they are all very horde biased. There are actually very few servers overall that are pvp and alliance baised, so there really is nothing they can merge them with. Really, no matter what they do, the alliance side of those servers is going to be very low.</div></div><hr />

It is funny that when Blizzard releases a patch and there is a tiny bug, there will be tons of people creating threads crying about it.. but when Blizzard takes their time and tests things ( and yes, this is ´testing´ it because there is no way they could test this on a PTR) then people come here and cry because it is taking so long.<br />
<br />
They did the first one a few weeks ago, there were a few issues with chat. They fixed those, and are now doing another test... and my guess is they will keep doing 1 test at a time until they do it without any issues.<br />
<br />
It is stupid to say 2017, I think anyone with half a brain knows it will speed up once they get a few more tests done.<br />

You know they could have avoided that &quot;technical marvel&quot; if they'd just lock all the low pop realms and gave free transfers for guild/players to whatever realm they like from those who would be prepared for migration by blizzard themselves, put an fixed date when the locked realm will be shut down and be done with it. <br />
<br />
Say EU Bloodfeather with a population of 15.000 people is being locked, the realm will be shut down January 1st. 2014, all players and guilds have the possibility to move freely to any of the designated realms Realm A, Realm B or Realm C. <br />
<br />
When the server shuts down, people can still move guilds and their characters for free through the battle.net website even if they come back to WoW in 2017. In reality all Europe needs right now is 20 to 25 realms (including German, Russian, Spanish and Italian ones) and we have about 60 if not more of those, everything else can be shut down, and they should do the above and figure a solution to balance the ratio between those 20 to 25 servers, instead of merging 5k server with 5k server which will equal 10k, but the top servers are still over 100k. <br />
<br />
I have no idea why they don't or didn't do something like that, must have something to do with pride and not admitting that 60% of European servers are pretty much dead, while 5-6 of servers are overpopulated.<br />
<br />
And yes, some realms are pretty much dead and the situation is not overstated, there are realms with around 5.000 people in total, where's my server Kazzak has 2000 people queue each evening, and is completely horde dominated, there is still more people on the alliance side on Kazzak than on 60% server of Europe in total and it is like that since about 2 to 3 years, it is sad that what I wrote above hasn't been done 3 years ago.<br />
<br />
What they are doing now is basically instancing the world, exactly what WoW was famous not to do - on seamless world.</div></div><hr />

Say you get that option, then two of your friends go to A, five go to B, and one goes to C. Where does that leave you?<br />
<br />
Or perhaps you're coming back to the game, only to find your server isn't there anymore. Then what? <br />
<br />
That is why they aren't doing this; you create more problems than you solve.<br />

They need to offer free server transfers on a cool down to people and faction changes as well. That's been the solution to this problem, remains the solution to this problem. Merging of a couple dead realms does little to nothing to solve many of the realms problems. Also this solution is doing nothing to address faction balance and maybe making it worse for people. The idea that people would be tied to a server forever unless they choose to pay some fee is absurd.<br />
<br />
Also let's cut to the heart of the matter, the reason server population matters so much is raiding. They could and they should allow current content normal and heroic raiding to be cross server. There is no reason they can not other then they have choose to not allow it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Free transfers only would contribute to the faction balance problem. The reason we have super-high population servers with lopsided factions on them is they hear that there are more of their faction there and it builds on that. <br />
<br />
Nobody seriously cares about balancing factions; they just want more of their own faction. If that wasn't true places like Illidan or Area 52 wouldn't be as lopsided as they are now.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, the devs already answered this. First off, you give a list of major changes that would have to be made, and then make it seem like they could do that in five minutes. What you described is probably as time-consuming as what they are doing now, plus there would be a ton of customer service calls.<br />
<br />
But to answer why their solution is better than yours.. as they already said. Just merging servers creates a ton of issues with names, guild structures and even realm names for players coming back who suddenly find their server no longer listed.<br />
<br />
Blizzard solution is far superior to yours. It is working amazingly on the servers it has been tested on already, and over the coming months, more and more servers will be added. Without having to destroy guilds or change names.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but you are a little ignorant of other games and the disasters they had when they tried to merge servers. Some of the biggest guilds in warhammer completely fell apart, and most quit in anger because guilds were just ripped apart and with name changes, there were no ways for players to easily reconnect.<br />
<br />
Blizzard solution is awesome, players just need to have patience until they test it.</div></div><hr />
