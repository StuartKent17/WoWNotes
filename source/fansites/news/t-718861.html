A couple of quests will be added to the game to introduce the Ruby Sanctum. If you do not know who are the dragons mentioned in the quest descriptions, you might want to check the Dargonax (http://www.wowwiki.com/Dargonax) / Sinestra (http://www.wowwiki.com/Sinestra) articles on WoWWiki. These quests have been added to the Ruby Sanctum Info Compilation (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/ruby-sanctum-info-compilation-preview/).<br />

<br />
Quest - Trouble at Wyrmrest (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/26012/trouble-at-wyrmrest/)<br />
Objective - Speak with Krasus at Wyrmrest Temple in Dragonblight.<br />
Description<br />
My old friend Krasus sends word of dire happenings at Wyrmrest, in Dragonblight. His missive was brief, but it seems that there has been some sort of attack on the Ruby Sanctum beneath the Temple.<br />
<br />
Pressing business here in Dalaran keeps me from attending to the matter personally, but I have heard word of your exploits in the Lich King's Citadel and you are doubtless up to the task -- perhaps you could assist Krasus in my stead? <br />
<br />
Quest - Assault on the Sanctum (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/26013/assault-on-the-sanctum/)<br />
Objective - Investigate the Ruby Sanctum beneath Wyrmrest Temple.<br />
Description<br />
&lt;race&gt;, something terrible has transpired within the Ruby Sanctum beneath the Temple. The entry to the Sanctum is in ruins, and its guardians violently slain. We sent scouts to investigate, but they have not returned. I cannot help but fear the worst.<br />
<br />
Enter the Ruby Sanctum and discover what has befallen the home of my flight. Once we have more information, we can plan our next steps accordingly. <br />
<br />
Quest - The Twilight Destroyer (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/26034/the-twilight-destroyer/)<br />
Objective - Defeat Halion and repel the invasion of the Ruby Sanctum.<br />
Rewards - Emblem of Frost (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49426/emblem-of-frost/) x 5<br />
Description<br />
This was no reckless attack, but rather a carefully orchestrated strike against the heart of the Red Dragonflight. Zarithrian, on the bluff over there, is overseeing the assault, but the true leader of this force is a brash and powerful Twilight dragon named Halion. Not since Dargonax has a full-grown spawn of Sinestra's twisted experiments been seen.<br />
<br />
Slay him, &lt;name&gt;, and then when the invasion has been fully repelled, report to Krasus regarding all you have seen here. <br />

<br />
&quot;Build and &quot;spec&quot; are both fine. I wouldn't really go around trying to get people on the same page about this stuff. This is a community that still clings to &quot;rediculous&quot; and &quot;def cap&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I've never understood &quot;Teh Gladiator&quot; but I think the art style is enjoyable look at so long as I don't have to read the text.<br />

Penny Arcade was fair enough.<br />

It shows alot about WoW and what we used to rely on for so long can be changed at any moment without so much as a batting of an eye. Makes you think about all the changes to the world that have happened since release nearly 6 years ago.

It shows alot about WoW and what we used to rely on for so long can be changed at any moment without so much as a batting of an eye. Makes you think about all the changes to the world that have happened since release nearly 6 years ago. Much better than, &quot;lol gnms we r kewl dnt h8 us, i can editz vudeos&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
That videos is just so much better. It had a message, it had heart.<br />
<br />
But you know, nowadays they just go for &quot;OMG GAIS LOOK DIS IS LIEK SO KEWL!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
By the way, Steam Tanks are a dwarven creation. And the gnomes are even getting their own event, so I can't really say they are repressed within the Alliance, seeing as how we will all be helping them.<br />
And gnomes aren't labelled traitors in any way, it was that one guy and the leper gnomes inside Gnomeragan that were, by the surviving gnomes.<br />
<br />
It's just a show-off in editing, with no content in it other then inaccurate falsehoods for the sake of making it look cool.</div></div><hr />

Umm, yeah beacause getting 5 frosts from a quest that can be done once in a raid that probably awards you more than that is serious business. I for one don't need frost emblems anymore, so I would've liked a proper reward from the quest. :&lt;</div></div><hr />

Still, it is a while till Cataclysm comes out, so it would be nice to have something more than &quot;Hey, go look at this thing and kill this guy&quot;.

And of course Ruby Sanctum is filler content, but not in the same context as this cynical whiners place it in. Its introductory material leading into the events of Cataclysm, yes its filler in that Blizzard is giving us something new to gnaw on before the new expansion, but its filler content with a purpose. If they simply did nothing but leave us to dink around ICC till Cataclysm came out, the same people would gripe about having nothing new to do.<br />

<br />
I would say it's pretty much the same. Maybe if you take it from a Rogue point of view, I would say Combat would be a spec, and whether you are combat dagger or combat sword that would depend on the build.<br />
So that would make: <br />
Spec - Which talent tree you spend most points in.<br />
Build - How you spend the talents in that tree.<br />
(At least Imo)</div></div><hr />

<br />
MMOs are a different breed of games. When I buy a new console game, I check basic reviews but I like to be surprised. In MMOs, I read everything I can because that's how you get ahead in this game.<br />
<br />
I can almost guarantee that people who read information as its released or data-mined do much better throughout the game then those who don't.<br />
<br />
You want to be a progressive guild-better know your boss fights well before they release or you will fall behind.<br />
<br />
You want to get a better arena rating- better read up on upcoming changes to all class mechanics, not just wait and see.<br />
<br />
When dealing with a cooperative(guild)/competitive(other guilds/faction) game on such a social scale, knowledge is indeed power and it will take you far.<br />
<br />
Surprises are nice, but when it prevents you from getting ahead, it can cost you guild mates or arena partners.<br />

The chain is more to give those who are unaware directions on where to go. *shrug* A simple breadcrumb quest, I suppose.</div></div><hr />

Stiletto high heels will only buy the gnomes about 4-5 inches TOPS. Maybe then they will be able to use the handle.</div></div><hr />

also: teh gladiators if you decide to hunt down and kill that shark that bit your shins off (while you were jumping it) like 20 editions ago, maybe I'll start reading you again. For now I'll let you hobble around on bloody, not funny stupid plot stumps.<br />
