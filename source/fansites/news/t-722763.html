It's called the PTR. They don't want to screw up the transition from 333 to 335, so they're spacing it out. A problem can still occur for say, Korea, and not for any other region. But this allows them to pay more attention then implementing it to every region at once, and allows them to learn what a successful installation will entail.</div></div><hr />

Sucks for players outside the US but really can you blame them? If they feel they have to split up the release did you really think it would be released elsewhere first?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delebrin</div><div class="date">2010-06-01, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Their primary concern with releasing the patch to one region first is to iron out bugs with the Battle.net integration. It's easily possible that they disable the new raid until those problems are ironed out as well. It doesn't necessarily mean that the US will have a full week over Europe (and other regions) to try to get a world first. (There have been many patches that are released with content disabled until a later time, look at Icecrown as a good example with the boss gating.)<br />
<br />
I'm not saying Blizzard is going to do this, but it is very possible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
99.9% of the Euro server population benefits from this decision, and only the .1% that might realistically get a world first suffers. Same for asia.<br />
<br />
If you're in Ensidia, Stars, Paragon, etc then I could see being a bit upset but if you're not then seriously what are you complaining about? Just because some Euro guild gets the world first it doesn't mean that YOU accomplished some thing.</div></div><hr />

Releasing a brand new system in multiple regions (including two huge ones like EU and US) at once is a huge risk. No sane software developer would take responsability for that. This has nothing to do with granting world first kills or not, because I highly doubt they even care which region kills what first and when.</div></div><hr />

They are ALSO doing Battle.net maintenance at the end of the first phase of beta testing for SC2. Since that is scheduled to end on the 7th and expected to last 'a few weeks', it seems likely that patch 3.3.5 will be released on the 8th or the following Tuesday (15th) of June.</div></div><hr />

Your level of elitism is only outweighed by your level of ignorance, typical of citizens of many &quot;we used to be something great centuries ago&quot; ex-super powers. The only thing CERN did was come up with the general idea of the world wide web (vastly different than the Internet... basically one subset of it). Nevermind the fact that CERN is international and also includes scientists from all over the world. But despite that, it wasn't until University of Illinois created HTML with the first version of Mosaic that the WWW really took off.<br />
<br />
Sooooo.... you guys came up with a possible use for a network made almost wholly in the US, you couldn't really do much with that idea, and had to let the Americans figure out what to do. All your most brilliant minds, the top scientists in one massively funded organization, couldn't come up with how to fix this. But one university in the US could. Hmmmmm......<br />
<br />
Typical of European ingenuity, isn't it? Even when you come up with a genuinely good idea, you still can't do anything with it til the Americans get their hands on it.<br />

<br />
<br />
Dayum, this is so wrong. The whole &quot;america won the second world war on its own&quot; and everything about it. You know who won WWII pretty much singlehandedly, or rather would have if no other ally was there? Fucking Russia. There was no way in hell germany could have won against russia in the long term. And even without america, the germans were losing on the eastern front.<br />
<br />
So actually, we'd be speaking russian if the other allies (like you know, the commonwealth that did MUCH more fighting than the US in the european and african theatres) had not held back russia after germany's (eventual) fall.<br />
<br />
Just because Saving Private Ryan and lots of other Hollywood war movies portrait WWII as being won SOLELY by the US doesn't mean that that's what happened. You probably should read more history books. Because if you really believe that the allies wouldn't have won the world war (probably a few years later, I'll give you that) without the US, that you've been nothing but fooled by propaganda, just like the germans were. Just like every gullible citizen of every country in the world.<br />

It doesn't have anything to do with WoW. It's just an attempt to spread some of the hate from the SC2 beta forums and people raging over no chat channels at release. They aren't changing anything in WoW except to allow communication between the games/servers if you use the Real ID feature. <br />

Back to the topic though. It wouldn't suprise me if Blizzard doesn't flip the switch to have the Ruby sanctum live when the communication test is released.

My mommy used to tell me I was pretty special. :)<br />

Seriously, you're right, I probably let a little nerdrage get the better of me. But in a typical case of &quot;he started it first&quot;, that guy did start it first. :P As others are saying, this game that we all play happens to be made by an American company, and therefore they felt like releasing it here first. There are lots of very good Korean games that are released in Korea first. Do we complain? Europeans release their stuff first in Europe. Do we complain?<br />
<br />
Blizzcon is in the home city of the mother company. Can we complain? What bothers me, and most people, is that *some* people like to speak out of their ass. And when the country that you live in and love is insulted, then the natural reaction is to lash back. What would you do if your family is insulted? For some of us, with all its problems and deficiencies, we still love our country and can't stand when others insult it... ESPECIALLY in an arrogant and ignorant way.<br />
<br />
But if it makes you happy, I'll say to the citizens of Europe: we still love you. Just remember you guys have just as many ignorant &quot;rednecks&quot; as we do in the States. ;)</div></div><hr />

The acronym CERN originally stood, in French, for Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire (European Council for Nuclear Research), which was a provisional council for setting up the laboratory, established by 11 European governments in 1952. The acronym was retained for the new laboratory after the provisional council was dissolved, even though the name changed to the current Organisation Européenne pour la Recherche Nucléaire (European Organization for Nuclear Research) in 1954.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tang</div><div class="date">2010-06-01, 07:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's the principle.<br />
It's also the fact that a lot of us are so f*cking bored with WoW now, seeing more and more people going social/casual/non-raiders, well it pisses off everyone who still wants to try and finish ICC Heroic.<br />
<br />
There's been no new content now for almost 7 months. In that time, i've seen over 10 recruits who are terrible join the guild and be kicked within 3 weeks. I've seen 5 long-term members going social. I've seen 4 people join, get their reward, and then leave or go social (and thus get kicked a week later). I've seen us going from having enough people to just about get ICC25, to having a focused core working on ICC10 Heroic, to not even having enough people to get ICC10 because of various reasons.<br />
<br />
ICC has been here too long already. We've not even had closed Cata beta yet. We've not had RS yet. We've been stuck here for almost 7 months with very little content to keep us busy.<br />
<br />
When people go social or don't sign up for raids, we can't wait. When i can't raid, i get bored. When i get bored, i start hating. When i start hating, i start considering just going off and doing my own thing in WoW or finding a new guild.<br />
<br />
These past 2 weeks have been particularly bad because it's been immense boredom. If you can't motivate people to finish the raid tier, then there's no point in even using &quot;You're not bored until you've cleared it&quot; as an excuse to my reasoning, or saying &quot;go kill LK25HC or you can't say the game's boring&quot;.<br />
<br />
In Cataclysm, between the final tier/deathwing tier raid instances and expansion 4, they need to have content ready to put out every 3-5 months. Prepare it before you release the expansion, then fill in the bosses and other details closer to the time of release.<br />
<br />
Releasing 3.3.5 in the EU a week after just says to me that we're gonna have to wait another week, be bored for another week. By all means, lock RS out until the patch is available everywhere, but don't simply say that the patch will be a week later for non-US and not provide some sort of explanation on whether this will affect the raiding content or not.<br />
<br />
Right about now, it's almost as bad as the wait between ToC and ICC.<br />
<br />
<br />
I can understand the frustration of having little to do and dealing with the general apathy of the user base. My own guild, which is far from hard core, is still trying to down Arthas for the first time, and I'm not really sure if we'll manage to do it before people just start getting bored and decide it's ultimately not worth the effort to learn this one encounter when the rest of ICC has already been on farm for months.<br />
<br />
However, I don't see how waiting one more week will make much of a difference. You're trading one more week of boredom while waiting for Ruby Sanctum for one less week of boredome while waiting for Cataclysm (and I agree, it's pretty pathetic how much of a delay there's been between TOC and ICC, and ICC and Cata).<br />
<br />
Bottom line is that unless you feel like your guild is poised to get that world first Hallion kill, it's really only a matter of timing. Maybe a US guild like Juggernaut will get the world first, but who cares? Every one will still know that the US had a week head start, and if for some reason a Euro guild gets the first kill anyway, then every one in Europe can /flex and bask in vicarious glow of some one else's achievement. There's a better than average chance that the servers will be up and down for awhile anyway, so you may wind up with the best of both worlds.</div></div><hr />

Just because they'd like to have the content pushed to them at the same time doesn't mean it'll happen, but them seeing someone else getting it a week before them while they sit for a week (yes, it's just a week) will no doubt cause unrest, it's understandable.</div></div><hr />

This.<br />
Blizzard has no problem activating/deactivating bosses with a quick server restart. There's no reason why they should release Halion earlier anywhere.<br />
And yes, I would have thought the same thing if I was American. Having a level playing field for some pve competition should be in Blizzard's interest.</div></div><hr />

Yeah. Cause we're all fat like that. &gt;.&gt; Generalize, much.<br />
<br />
Anyway... I think it'd be more fair to have the instance closed until the other clients have it available to them. So it's a fair shot for those who want world firsts. I think it's been said already, but w/e. Top US guilds have been a few days behind EU guilds anyway; it's not like 1-week is a big difference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
NO company on the planet can ensure a &quot;smooth&quot; transition regardless of how much money they bring in. Internal testing catches a large number of bugs I'm sure. Beta testing catches a large quantity more. By the time a product is released, surely it is mostly bug free, but by the nature of going from thousands of testers (Beta) to millions of testers (Live), the test parameters will be MUCH wider and the chance for unseen bugs to pop up is likely. If there were 10,000 testers, but none of them was waterwalking in Moonglade backwards riding their Green Kodo, a bug related to this specifically would never have been discovered.<br />
<br />
All they are doing is releasing the product to a subset of their user base (ONE region) so that when they roll it out to all their other regions (three? four?) they can do so quickly, efficiently, and largely bug free.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I look at the bright side, US get to beta test all the problems that are bound to occur because of the battle.net ID system, which is honestly why they are probably doing it 1 region at a time. US makes sense for them to start out with, as obviously Blizzard development team is mostly based in US and can react to the problems that *may* occur.</div></div><hr />

[ok, seriously, the Internet was in fact created in the United States, primarily as a merger of the defense and university networks of the time. The HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Java, the operating code that almost all of your computers are running on, the technology that your computers are based on, the companies that make the processor, graphics, sound, and other critical components of your computers..... guess where they're all from? Yes, you guessed it, AMERICA. China builds them perhaps, but the US companies design, order, test, guarantee, package, and sell them.]<br />

1) If it wasn't for the Europeans (the English actually), YOU would be speaking German (it was a close second to be the national language at the creation of the USA due to it being known to more inhabitants at that time, only because of english influence in the world and the american elite was it chosen)<br />
2) A lot of technology actually is invented by Europeans ... in the USA. This is simply because of the &quot;do what you want&quot; mentality laws in the USA that make research easier.<br />
3) Both the theortical and practical inventers of the nuclear bomb and nuclear power in general were Europeans. Did you even know Einstein never gave a single class in English, even though he taught science in the USA for decades?<br />

The United States is a better place generally for research because our country is more corrupt and thus allows more grey area research to be done. Much of what is done in America is done for other countries such as Japanese owned factories. America's biggest area of dominance is arms sales which isn't a great selling point. The biggest export America has is Entertainment be it sports, music, movies, or other media. We take the best talent from other countries and they entertain the masses.<br />
<br />
In terms of education, benefits for the average working man, and working environment, Europe is superior. European politics are much fairer having multiple parties and opinions versus the two party system we have here. In America, you have to register in every single state with X number of signatures before you can even appear on the Presidential ballet. This makes regional politics obsolete as you have to have a national political base before you even are allowed to run. Ross Perot, the most successful recent candidate not to be in any major party, wasn't even on the ballet in all 50 states despite spending tens of millions of dollars building a national platform.<br />
<br />
Europe has nice things. America has nice things. They are just different things. I would happily live in either place. Comparing them is comparing apples and oranges. They are both great.<br />
<br />
Firsts are generally divided anyway because of the time difference. It's not fair to the EU that the US gets content before they do if you didn't take that into account. The Europeans have proven they have the best raiding guilds at the top end. That isn't in dispute. So who cares if Halion arrives a week later? We all know the truth anyway.</div></div><hr />

Isn't 'faster', which makes 'release date' largely irrelevant, the larger accomplishment? <br />
<br />
<br />
This all depends. If there was no information about the fight when Dave gets to start attempting the fight and Dave releases information before Tom gets to try, Tom has just benefited from Dave's knowledge and therefor the time Dave spent learning the information has to be added to Tom's time in some fashion.</div></div><hr />

Say, you had a choice:<br />
- get a car the day it comes out of prototype stage.<br />
- wait a week till complaints come in and get fixed.<br />
<br />
If you prefer option number one, you're probably the guy that's always moaning to developers they are doing a crappy job(read 90% of wow community). However, if you prefer option number two, you can -most of the time- be assured of a good working product.<br />
<br />
Stop thinking that this is about us vs rest, but think of it as first stage being taken with care vs massive release. <br />
<br />
Be honest, most of the 'rest' would start making identical threads complaining about the same thing in the tech-support forums if blizzard would do a mass release. At least this way it's a bit more managable. Which will most likely lead to a superior product. This is what should be priority.</div></div><hr />

Because it has an international audience, with a recognized good and competitive raiding scene. You could argue that the marathon is a sport created in Greece, but it wouldn't benefit the sport to let Greek runners start running five minutes earlier than foreigners.<br />
<br />
Personally I don't care much for who gets world first, because I know it won't be me. However, world 10th to world 100th or so is an area I'm very much interested in. It's affected too.</div></div><hr />

I would hope we get the release either within the next week or two, or at least prior to July. <br />
<br />
Also in regard to July, the &quot;Fire&quot; Festival is coming up. One would wonder whether or not they left the Ahume holiday event boss alone with Lv 70, or increased it to the modern Lv 80 standard? Maybe new loot off Ahume? Just hoping Blizzard looked into this event this year.</div></div><hr />

And to top it off you'll get a already live tested patch that'll probably be bug free but you'll crying? Such babies. I respect the few of you who aren't acting like your 3 years old. <br />
<br />
Blizzard is based in US, we get things first because it's made in U.S.! It makes perfect sense. Even if a lot of the player base is outside of the US it's still logical to TEST something on home grounds first. And like another person said above you're lucky Blizzard will release it a WEEK later and not months/years that so many European/Asian games have made us NA people wait for. <br />
<br />
I won't be bothered by this. I will not use the new chat feature nor will I probably complete the new raid in the first few days of it's release. It's a baby filler raid. Blizzard really needs to hurry up and release the beta soon. It's been SIX? months since FoTLK was released now. Seriously? Thats too long of a gap. I'm barely getting by doing the same stuff every week. What happened to releasing a content patch every 1-2 years? :S</div></div><hr />

<br />
And really? There's some form of competition on PVE firsts not just between top raiding guilds, but now countries so that even though you'll never be in the guild that does something &quot;first&quot; you can live up some of said &quot;glory&quot;?

We all know that WoW is a gargantuan undertaking in terms of technical coordination and upkeep.

Correction: You mean 90% of the people who read and post on forums which is barely 1% of all the players. There's 122k members on this website and this is probably the biggest playerbase yet just over 1% of all players have registered here. I would bet the QQ'r ratio is pretty high. :)<br />

<br />
Honestly, its pathetic.<br />
<br />
<br />
All from the first page of comments!<br />
<br />
Wow guys. Seriously? Don't get me wrong, this isn't an anti-foreigner post or anything, but get real. When Square makes a new Final Fantasy, where does it get released first? Say it with me now: Japan. It's not a unique thing that Blizzard does, and it sure as hell makes it a lot easier on them (and on you dare I say) for them to release patches in different areas at different times.<br />
<br />
In fact, let's read the blue post again for clarity. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 3.3.5 Regional Release Information<br />
<br />
In patch 3.3.5, we will be introducing our new Battle.net system, which opens up new communication options for World of Warcraft players and lays the groundwork for integration with future Blizzard games, such as StarCraft II. In order to ensure that the implementation of this major new system goes as smoothly as possible, we plan to release the patch to North American realms first, with Europe, Korea, and the region of Taiwan following approximately one week afterward.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways, everyone knows that there are top notch guilds all over the world, STARS has shown us that, as well as multiple other guilds.<br />
<br />
If you are crying about the content being released later for you because you are in a guild that actually vies for world firsts, then I feel some of your pain. I understand that it can be hard on you emotionally. On that note, if you are in a guild that vies for world firsts, get some sun.<br />
<br />
If you are crying because you want the patch content sooner, just remember that it will most likely be more stable when you get it.<br />
<br />
Can we stop the emo &quot;I need my [fill-in-the-blank] patch now because I don't know what I'll do for a week while these American baddies get loots&quot; QQing now, please?</div></div><hr />

<br />
[ok, seriously, the Internet was in fact created in the United States, primarily as a merger of the defense and university networks of the time. The HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Java, the operating code that almost all of your computers are running on, the technology that your computers are based on, the companies that make the processor, graphics, sound, and other critical components of your computers..... guess where they're all from? Yes, you guessed it, AMERICA. China builds them perhaps, but the US companies design, order, test, guarantee, package, and sell them.]<br />
<br />
So take your Eurotrash self back to school, &quot;dear sir.&quot; You guys would be speaking German if it wasn't for America.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, I've been lurking on this site for quite some time, but really, this post spurred me on to register. Just couldn't resist.<br />
<br />
Firstly, if you're going to suggest that the internet was created entirely by yanks (which, strictly speaking, is far from the case anyway) then might I remind you who it was that created America? A bit of a Frankenstein's monster sort of mistake really.<br />
<br />
Besides, who'd care if everyone in Europe now spoke German? We could live on in peace knowing that somewhere in the world the English language was still being used in some sort of awful bastardised form (yes, it's bastardised, not bastardized).<br />
<br />
Anyway, on topic, I expect they'll simply lock Halion out until 3.3.5 is deployed in all regions.</div></div><hr />

We all know there isn't really a World First since the beginning seeing how US always get patch updates before us (also that Vanilla was released in US around 3 months before EU)<br />

The World Wide Web, this thing that we're using right now and is a massive collection of networks webbed together, was created by an Englishman (Sir Tim Berners-Lee). Also as the director of the W3C it is he who is making sure that the html language is the same worldwide.<br />
<br />
So please, don't try and make it sound as though America is the only reason we have computers.<br />
<br />
Instead of us going back to school, maybe you should start. If it weren't for us you would probably be speaking... huh... nothing, due to not existing.<br />

If we werent there Russia would have fought on two fronts and probably would have lost. Canada, UK, and US also were there for D-Day, and that allowed us to severely weaken Germany. Hell, if anyone should get the most credit it should be the UK, because they were the only one who was there the whole time. Remember though, the war wouldnt have been won if any of the 3 allies werent there. It was a group effort. So all you American and European elitists can shove it.<br />

It wasn't America's war to fight in. We did not need to be in it the entire time. By the time we stepped in England was days away from falling to the Germans.

Ill laugh, both because it will incite more crying from the Europeans and because the US still wont be able to get the world first (Not that a Halion world first actually matters). ::)<br />

So you're admitting posting just to flame, with no intentions to discuss things like others here are. Your post reeked of elitist and you're just trying to change your tune at this point it seems for obvious reason. Unless you meant it differently somehow but your post was so poorly written it certainly didn't read like that.<br />

And it's a delight for me to read this thread too. People crying over something the US players are going to have to trudge through which will potentially help ensure a better launch for other segments of the world.

99.9% of the Euro server population benefits from this decision, and only the .1% that might realistically get a world first suffers. Same for asia.<br />
<br />
If you're in Ensidia, Stars, Paragon, etc then I could see being a bit upset but if you're not then seriously what are you complaining about? Just because some Euro guild gets the world first it doesn't mean that YOU accomplished some thing. <br />

This post sums it all up. Bunch of whiners who wouldn't even be close on world first anyways. They see someone getting something 7 days earlier and cry like little bitches. It's am American based company, so they release the patch on American servers first.<br />
<br />
The problem with world of casualcraft these days is that everyone can down every encounter so everyone thinks they're good when the vast majority are still terrible. I'm willing to bet not a single EU or Asian server player that has posted here even stood 1/10000000000 of a chance of getting a world first whether the patch was released worldwide or not.<br />
<br />
The competition for world first normal mode doesn't mean shit. Any scrub group can walk in and kill Halion on normal. Even heroic mode, who cares, this is a filler raid.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard is owned by Vivendi btw, and I hope you know that they are french. So no, Blizzard is not an American company it is an international company with FANS all over the world. Most of their players are outside of America (the continent)<br />

I honestly wouldn't give a shit if the patch was released in europe first because i am not 1) part of the .001% of players who have a chance at a world first heroic (which is the only world first that matters for such an easy normal mode boss) and 2) someone who gives a shit about world firsts. the content will reach me and when it does i will play it. <br />
<br />
everyone wants to make it a fucking eu &amp; asia vs america thing. its a fucking game, stfu and play it and stop crying. it plain and simple made more sense for them to release it at home first. do you have any idea how game development works? have you ever worked in game dev? clearly not from your ignorant comments. pushing that kind of data to the entire world at once is horribly risky and instead of having to deal with massive issues on a global scale they wanted to smooth things out in north america first. due to the feedback they received they have announced now that they will release it later so that everyone will be happy. <br />
<br />
the point of the post was that almost no one on this site stood any chance of getting that world first, so they need to stop crying. if you can't wait 7 days to try something new then that's pathetic.<br />
<br />
and just because vivendi is a french company doesn't make blizzard any less american. they began in america, work out of america and will continue to be american regardless of who owns them. I work for EA who own dozens of game developers around the world. those studios do not become american simply because an american (or canadian, depending on who you ask) company now owns them.<br />

The United States is a better place generally for research because our country is more corrupt and thus allows more grey area research to be done. Much of what is done in America is done for other countries such as Japanese owned factories. America's biggest area of dominance is arms sales which isn't a great selling point. The biggest export America has is Entertainment be it sports, music, movies, or other media. We take the best talent from other countries and they entertain the masses.<br />
<br />
In terms of education, benefits for the average working man, and working environment, Europe is superior. European politics are much fairer having multiple parties and opinions versus the two party system we have here. In America, you have to register in every single state with X number of signatures before you can even appear on the Presidential ballet. This makes regional politics obsolete as you have to have a national political base before you even are allowed to run. Ross Perot, the most successful recent candidate not to be in any major party, wasn't even on the ballet in all 50 states despite spending tens of millions of dollars building a national platform.<br />
<br />
Europe has nice things. America has nice things. They are just different things. I would happily live in either place. Comparing them is comparing apples and oranges. They are both great.<br />
<br />
Firsts are generally divided anyway because of the time difference. It's not fair to the EU that the US gets content before they do if you didn't take that into account. The Europeans have proven they have the best raiding guilds at the top end. That isn't in dispute. So who cares if Halion arrives a week later? We all know the truth anyway.<br />

America owns only one type of export and that is my friend; War!</div></div><hr />

No, America didn't win the European Theater single-handedly but to say that they did nothing is just utterly moronic. The U.S. encountered a huge amount of Germany's best generals and defeated them. To say that the German's having to split their forces and focus their attention on two different fronts wasn't key to the Germany losing WWII is an absurdity. The real winner of WWII was really Hitler ironically because he was the loser as well. Hitler defeated himself in WWII when he decided to take over immediate command of the Wermacht, Luftwaffe, etc. and split the front. Hitler defeated himself. Russia could hardly have been considered winners when you look at the state of the country after WWII with half of Leningrad starving and the other half eating the people that starved to death. Stalingrad being in shambles after the siege. Sure they forced them back into Germany then took the Reichstag but at a huge cost.</div></div><hr />
