Dalaran / Shattrath Portals Removal<br />
The reason the portals from Shattrath were not removed from Outland when Wrath of the Lich King released is that there was a new central hub with portals to all major cities in Northrend. There is no longer a neutral city hub which both factions will be using in Cataclysm. We want to ensure visiting the major faction capitals is still the most attractive thing to do in Cataclysm, rather than having people use Shattrath and Dalaran as easy connector hubs.<br />
<br />
To make up for this, we'd like to add class trainers and Auctioneers in Shattrath and Dalaran for those leveling through The Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King content. <br />

Guild Achievements - Exalted Reputations<br />
All reputations are retroactive. If you have the rep now, it will count in the guild achievement. Also note that the reputations have to be separate. Having Argent Dawn at exalted on 8 members still only counts as one towards the achievement.<br />
<br />
Also, don't forget that this achievement requires revered guild faction for any of your reputations to count. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26850249999/guild-achievement-exalted-reputations/))<br />

Rating requirements on PvP Gear<br />
The only item with a meaningful rating requirement is the heroic raid ilvl equivalent weapon (the 2200 weapon). However, unlike the LK seasons there is also a weapon equivalent to the normal raid tier ilvl that has no rating requirement.<br />
<br />
All of the other items with rating requirements (ie: the set pieces) have the exact same stats as the ones without rating requirements, they're a free upgrade and just have a different texture color so you get a little bit of visual distinction for having a high rating (no gameplay advantage).

<br />
Threat / Threat Decay<br />
We actually never implemented threat decay. We're not sure we'll need it.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is that being a good tank is a mark of pride for tanks. It's not fun to do a job well that any guy off the street could do with no practice or experience. Getting better at your job is a major motivator for players to play.<br />
<br />
Threat is part of that. Back in the day, you got excited when you had a tank who knew how to generate threat. It was a source of bragging rights for the tank.<br />
<br />
So just autoattacking, or just Thunder Clapping, shouldn't be enough for you to never worry about threat. You should have to pay as much attention to your rotations as an Affliction lock or Frost DK needs to do in order to be competitive on meters.<br />
<br />
We don't want to go too far though. While it's not asking much for a mage to wait a few seconds before unloading with everything they have, it's also not fun if you feel that tank threat is constantly throttling you. In particular, we're trying to clamp down on the situation where say at minute six or seven despite everything the tank can do, the dps start to creep up on you. Vengeance was implemented almost entirely for this reason -- it helps keep tanks scaling their threat as dps classes gear up.<br />
<br />
Finally, we don't want the tank to be solely at the mercy of others to generate threat. We don't want abilities like Tricks of the Trade or Misdirection or dps classes using their threat drop abilities on cooldown to solve the whole problem for the tank. All of those abilities still exist, but they won't turn a bad tank into a good one and they won't make a great tank feel 100% at the mercy of others. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26859270372/blizzard-s-stated-intention-for-cata-tanks/))<br />
<br />
Tank Balance<br />
As far as tank balance goes, in beta we found that DKs and Feral druids were taking less damage than paladins and warriors. This is partially because of the Sanctuary bug (where it just wasn't working). Beyond that, the avoidance of the former were just a lot higher. Druids get dodge and DKs get parry just from wearing Agi and Str respectively. Block tanks used to get a little mitigation from Strength, but it was never much, and that won't really work any longer with the new model. Solutions include letting Str affect parry (for everyone in the same way Agi provides dodge) or giving all plate users some kind of Forceful Deflection passive or talent.<br />
<br />
Basically, we think that avoidance below 20% or so doesn't feel very good because you don't see it, and avoidance above around 70% or so breaks encounters and forces us to add &quot;radiance&quot; debuffs to raids. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26726066766/4-0-protection-paladin-feedback/))<br />
<br />
Casting vs. auto attacks<br />
I could see a model where a melee class just stands there until they hit a button and all of their damage is pushed into those buttons. It's a pretty big change though. For starters, many spells used by casters have actual cast bars (and can be interrupted) while melee are mostly using instant attacks. Casters do damage every 2 sec or so, while melee could do damage every 1.5 or 1 sec, as long as resources held out. It's probably possible to do, but it is a really big change.

Word of Glory scaling<br />
Word of Glory now scales with either attack power or spell power, whichever is higher. The net result is that Ret and Prot Word of Glory will heal for at least 50% more than they did before. That was why we had to nerf Selfless Healer. If I am remembering correctly, a level 85 Ret or Prot paladin 3 Holy Power WoG went from around 6000 to around 9000 (before Selfless Healer or Guarded by the Light). You should test it yourself though, since I may be misremembering. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26726066766/4-0-protection-paladin-feedback/))<br />
<br />
Zealotry / Holy Power<br />
We were able to greatly improve the delay on receiving Holy Power from Divine Purpose. It still may not appear faster than you can hit your next button. To address that, we are going to try a model where if you have 3 Holy Power and get a fourth, you'll still receive that fourth Holy Power if you spend the first 3 within a couple of seconds. In essence, if the Holy Power is already &quot;in the mail&quot; you'll still get it. You can't hold it indefinitely, so you shouldn't treat the system as if you now have 4 Holy Power to play with. It just makes you less likely to waste a charge.<br />
<br />
Barring something horribly unforeseen, there is no way we'll ultimately let a 2 Holy Power Templar's Verdict be the right way to play. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26850249828/zealotry/))<br />
<br />
Guardian of the Ancient Kings<br />
Guardian of Ancient Kings should be off the GCD (for everyone). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26859119980/holy-paladin-build-13033-feedback/))<br />
<br />
Holy<br />
We think we are liable to consolidate some of the Judgement related talents for Holy. We're unlikely to make Judging even more of a big deal for Holy though.<br />
<br />
We're going to try to get the 10 points Holy spends in other trees to be a little less cookie-cutterish. Options include making Divinity or Rule of Law not healing related.<br />
<br />
We'll keep an eye on Holy's damage for purposes of leveling, etc. I do believe some of that feedback though comes from creatures just being really powerful now. You're not seeing Holy being weak at leveling. You're seeing everyone having to work more than they are used to. This is a situation we're closely monitoring. We don't want questing to be trivial and boring, but we don't want it to be brutally punishing either. <br />
<br />
I'm still worried about the lack of interactivity. Daybreak and Word of Glory are talents that you react to in an incredibly simple way now. Healing without wasting Holy Power isn't a high benchmark.<br />
<br />
Changing Daybreak has taken out a rewarding and fun spell combination that made the class a lot more interesting and dynamic to play. <br />
<br />
It has a lot more going on than it does on Live. No, you aren't overly punished for mismanaging Holy Power, but healers need to have a lot of flexibility. Sometimes you don't want to cast Holy Shock or Word of Glory on the tank because you need to do something more dramatic. In addition to the mechanics you mentioned, there are buffs such as Conviction and Judgements of the Pure to watch out for, as well as several cooldowns: Divine Favor, Avenging Wrath and Guardian.<br />
<br />
Daybreak still requires you to watch the proc, or you're going to fail to cast Holy Shock twice in a row. It's just less sensitive to latency and makes you less likely to have to resort to cancel macros now. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26859119980/holy-paladin-build-13033-feedback/))<br />
<br />
Light of Dawn<br />
It is target sensitive. If you heal one person, it's not going to do impressive numbers. In situations where it hits 10 people, it will perform really well. You will need to look out for situations where it will be the most optimal. Part of why it can heal so much is it is far from being a smart heal. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26859119980/holy-paladin-build-13033-feedback/))<br />
<br />
What people want is this: Light of Dawn, No Cooldown, Requires Holy Power, Heals players for 1000/2000/3000, consuming all holy power in the cast.<br />
The reason we didn't do that is because the times you need AE heals are usually because several folks took damage all at once. That is why so many AE heals are instant. Even those with a cast time aren't as long as something that requires 3 Holy Power. Nor do we want you to have to neglect Word of Glory on fights with periodic AE damage. To have a long ramp up - high throughput AE heal be useful, there would have to be a lot of encounters like Loatheb or something where the damage is fairly constant but folks aren't often in immediate danger of dying.<br />
<br />
I could see (someday) giving paladins a heal that hit 3-5 targets but otherwise worked exactly like Word of Glory. But since we gave paladins 4 new heals already, as well as reasons to use both Flash and Holy Light, let's see if we can get the current model feeling good first. I think we're close.

Auto attack and abilities<br />
Imagine a rogue could do 80% of their damage just by right clicking on a target. That means that at best, you've got 20% of damage to play with to separate the best rogue in the world from the guy who just autoattacks. That's largely what we mean when we're concerned about too much damage coming from white attacks.<br />
<br />
You can argue that Slice and Dice doesn't take much effort on the part of the rogue, but it does take some. Managing your energy and cooldowns takes a little more, and so on, until we reach a point where the best rogues in the world do significantly more damage than those who just autoattack and perhaps let Slice and Dice occasionally fall off.<br />
<br />
I think viscerally, some players just don't like spending their resource on buffs. They want to convert it all into big numbers, because big numbers are fun. Those self buffs serve a purpose though. They help serve as a damage buffer. They provide a little bit of ramp up time. They account for one more ball you need to juggle to keep in the air. It wouldn't be hard to juggle just the one ball, but you're often asked to do a lot more than that. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26859267996/questions-for-devs-about-rogues/))<br />
<br />
Stunlocks<br />
They &quot;stopped the arms race&quot; by disarming rogues of stunlocks, which were already taken care of with the increased HP pools, but didn't remove the reactionary (and far more OP) skills that negate the emasculated stuns.<br />
That wasn't the problem with stunlocks. It wasn't a balance issue per se of whether or not the rogue could kill someone or not. The problem was that the situation was too binary. If the rogue executed a perfect stun chain, then they would win. If they screwed up or were countered, they would lose. Both the rogue and the opponent might as well have 1 health in that scenario because there is no room for fractions. Imagine instead that getting 1 stun off makes you half as effective instead of not effective at all.<br />
<br />
There are ways for some classes to mitigate stuns, absolutely. (The alternative is the awesome rogue just always gets a stun off.) But there are fewer than before, and the talents that just provide mechanic duration reductions are all gone. That was the arms race we were talking about. If rogues can just never stun anyone and are kited all the time, then we'll fix it. But very few of you have experienced level 85 PvP yet, so it's hard to for us to react too strongly to supposition and hypothesis.<br />
<br />
Try out the Tol Barad tests we're doing soon and see how it feels in appropriate gear at max level. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26859267996/questions-for-devs-about-rogues/))<br />

Gotta agree here, ofcourse it also depends on the battlegroup i'm currently in but I really notice bg's have been empty for ages. Not being able to compete with arena players in BG (due to gear atleast) can be demotivating... and with guild pvp achievements it can be a lot more fun if everyone gets nice rewards for running those/</div></div><hr />

Unless your a major RP'er and have larp contests, if you are horde, this should not even remotely bother you. The same way that cloaks and feet go through all mounts currently.<br />

Healing is NOT complicated. You heal ppl when they take dmg... if you dont they die... You CAN NOT wait for some stuff to proc or to not use some spells because then you spend 30 sec cd that you might have to use later on. What on EARTH are they thinking ??? <br />
<br />
Compare the healing classes.... The job of other healing classes is to watch those that need healing and control their mana. Holy palas need to watch procs - and holy power - and mana BEFORE they can think of how to heal up the person - that then is about to die. <br />
<br />
Fun mecanics my arse... It is NOT fun to see ppl dead !!! When one class has to suffer because of complicated mecanics while others hit one button smartheal... Then its time for the devs to get a real kick in the bum.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why well if you now are so god damn good, Then you beat those?<br />
and yes its kinda welfare gear, but since mastery rating has come it wont be that good.<br />
<br />
And an example would be you are 3 friends you reroll new classes to pvp deep into next season you need to gear up and for that you need to win. without the gear coming in god damn blues will make you, Even if you are better you wont stand a chance against rating geared ppl that are really bad.<br />
<br />
its the truth wow = gear &gt; skill , skill makes diffrence but not so much as lets say playing counter-strike competetive or HoN or Quakelive.<br />
<br />
Its like starting with plant and everyone positioned with perfect position with flashes on a bombspot B @ d2. thats how much advatage you have with that rating gear vs new starters.<br />
<br />
and if you are so damn good stop qq and beat them? oh wait..... you aint that good thank you, and if you are tell me another game you played at high lvl that atleast requier alot of skill to play except for wow pvp, Becuse the skill roof aint high in wow compared to other games.<br />
<br />
Problem is there is to many bad wowers with tunnelvision and aspect of using their correct ability executed well together and that aint hard with proper skill and communication. and to counter such attack is also easy to prevent.<br />
<br />
gear &gt; setup &gt; skill. thank you.<br />

Currently on live auto attacks and poison count for about 70% of total rogue damage and aoe is average at best. On the beta auto attack and poison counts for 70-75% of assassinations damage and 60% of combat damage(which is now probably closer to 65-70% with the offhand buff) and aoe damage is only slightly improved for assassination.</div></div><hr />

Most of them are pointing out the issues but Blizzard have taken a stand against those players - Not because those ppl are wrong... but because Blizzard has put the spec into a situtation where they can't go back and fix those issues... <br />
<br />
Its called Cornered animal syndrome. Fight back instead of listening and react in the right manner..<br />
<br />
Or even if they could fix things - they wont because some of the Egos had some sort of vision about the spec.... Im pretty sure we are talking same ppl that thought the death knight design with dmg and tanking in every spec would be a smart move... <br />
<br />
Again - healing is not complicated for 3 of 4 healing classes. Still the ONLY goal of the current healing mecanic for paladins is to make it complicated. And even if its done right... you still end up with limited tools to actually fill the shoes of the other healers that have fast smartheals to do the job.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
didn't read the whole threat, only the first page and the comment of GC on the original post on MMO.<br />
<br />
The idea's are some sort of good for a holy paladin. We got 2 new AoE spells, some talent look nice (on paper), we got some sort of more choice in other healing spells.<br />
<br />
Which makes me sort of a happy holy paladin. sort of :)<br />
<br />
<br />
The implementation is ... bad.<br />
<br />
On paper our spells/buffs look ike they benefit from each others, ingame i haven't found a situation where to use them good. They are up, yeah. Ow, they're not up /shrug<br />
If someone is dying, i;m not waiting for buff X from spell Y to make spell Z a superheal. I just cast the spell that saves the other.<br />
For DPS these buffs are ok, but for healing ... no. So the holy buffs needs some work :) maybe turn them into buff you can choose to activate on a X min cooldown.<br />
<br />
But i have good hope. Well, have? i had good hope until i read GC comment. Damm, that's just shocking :O Can you imagine you want to buy something, and the salesman talks to you like GC did there. I would defenetly go to another shop. With WoW you got no choice to leave because other games suck.<br />
<br />
But i;m trying not to bash blizz here, so lets try to give some advice (not that they ever going to read it :D but who cares)<br />
<br />
And the healing numbers needs to be tweaked for sure.<br />
FoL is to expensive and heals to less. Can't see a reason not to use HS then. Anyway, makes some room on my action bar now :)<br />
HL is to cheap and slow. I got tons of haste, even got a talent to reduce the cast time, but it still feels like ages to cast the damm spell.<br />
divine light heals to less (just over a HL heal). Make it a real big heal please.<br />
World of glory ... is this a joke spell? Got the feeling this spell is broken and don't use SP<br />
<br />

Thing is Dalaran turning into a hiding place for Mages actually makes it more loreflavour-awesome (new term?). It's a Mage city after all.<br />

I'm loving the scorpion more and more and cannot wait for the wrath of fail to be over.<br />
It does make you wonder what the Horde was thinking when it decided to befriend animals that, when ridden, have a giant poisonous barb only inches away from the back of the rider's neck. Feet and cloaks going through mounts are graphical limitations, not a part of the mount's overall look.<br />
<br />
It's a really poor decision on Blizzard's part to make this &quot;mount&quot; a reality, and it still doesn't look that good, even with the armor. Not that the Alliance mount is any &quot;cooler&quot;, this one's just dumb.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is so true. PvP in Wotlk was actually challenging and way more balanced than it was on TBC. Season PvP gear, apart from offset pieces should require rating so that atleast you have to be somewhat skilled to get those. Now every goddamn pve scrub is going to run around with their full pvp tier.<br />
<br />
That's what's Blizzard has been trying to do all along. Giving easy epics to less skilled (brained) people. Wotlk - Easy Pve gear for noobs, and from what im seeing here Cataclysm will be like Easy PvP gear for noobs. I guess Blizzard wants to make Rated BGS &gt; Arenas aswell, since now when it comes to arenas, you're just aiming for the 2.2k weps, if you're a bit far from that rating, I think people will just start getting bored at it and eventually drop it out.</div></div><hr />

Only thinkg that I can see to make things right is to add the portal hubs to not only Dal and Shatt but all capitols.

Casting vs. auto attacks<br />
I could see a model where a melee class just stands there until they hit a button and all of their damage is pushed into those buttons. It's a pretty big change though. For starters, many spells used by casters have actual cast bars (and can be interrupted) while melee are mostly using instant attacks. Casters do damage every 2 sec or so, while melee could do damage every 1.5 or 1 sec, as long as resources held out. It's probably possible to do, but it is a really big change.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The first thing that came to my mind was making the wand skill the caster auto attack. Finally make use of the actual wand, instead of another stat stick. Thoughts?</div></div><hr />

Most likely they aren't the same mages. I've seen some mages in the last day and a half that are happy to provide their service of porting people again.

Speaking of reskins, The alliance guild mount is a just reskinned nightsaber, we all know that, but it's not like horde guild mount is any better, it's just reskinned quraji mount. <br />

&quot;Heh, and the Alliance gets another cat mount. The lion is fitting I think, but come on, another cat... I think others could have been done to add a bit more variety; a Pegasus or a Sphinx for example... just tired of all the cats.&quot; <br />

As for the comment about alliance getting a pegasus or sphinx( which is a cat). You mean a reskinned sparkle pony or reskinned cat? <br />

I'm just tired of the reskinning blizz does. Mounts look cool yes, but the more i think of it less guild mount and more faction mounts. Make a few and let the guild decide what mounts they want to represent them. Hell there should be a guild flying mount too.</div></div><hr />

In that case, all the races are just reskins of eachother too, and everything else is a reskin of everything else... You sir, are insane. Do you even know what reskinning is? It's using the same MODEL with different SKINS aka COLOR/TEXTURES. A purple skeleton horse is a reskin of a green skeleton horse. A lion with manes, different paws, tail, etc. is not a reskin of a tiger. It's a new MODEL with the same SKELETON (which gives the same animations), which is something very different.</div></div><hr />

You sir, are insane. Do you even know what reskinning is? It's using the same MODEL with different SKINS aka COLOR/TEXTURES. A purple skeleton horse is a reskin of a green skeleton horse. A lion with manes, different paws, tail, etc. is not a reskin of a tiger. It's a new MODEL with the same SKELETON (which gives the same animations), which is something very different.<br />
<br />
Aka remodeled (not reskinned). The lion is remodeled from an existing mount. The scorpion is remodeled from an existing model, but not a mount (but from a mob).</div></div><hr />

I wonder how quickly a guild will level while raiding. If its decent the more serious guilds might be running around on their lions and scorpions fairly quickly.<br />
<br />
The only place anyone will be using a ground mount is in a city and BG anyway, so it's not like an awesome epic ground mount will make your epeen that much bigger, so the &quot;ur mount's cooler than our mount qqqqqq&quot; is a bit pointless.</div></div><hr />

This is so true. PvP in Wotlk was actually challenging and way more balanced than it was on TBC. Season PvP gear, apart from offset pieces should require rating so that atleast you have to be somewhat skilled to get those. Now every goddamn pve scrub is going to run around with their full pvp tier.<br />
<br />
That's what's Blizzard has been trying to do all along. Giving easy epics to less skilled (brained) people. Wotlk - Easy Pve gear for noobs, and from what im seeing here Cataclysm will be like Easy PvP gear for noobs. I guess Blizzard wants to make Rated BGS &gt; Arenas aswell, since now when it comes to arenas, you're just aiming for the 2.2k weps, if you're a bit far from that rating, I think people will just start getting bored at it and eventually drop it out.<br />
<br />
I would be pretty happy to see arena players drop out, since they just hurt other aspects of the game with their QQ.<br />
<br />
Wow pvp has never been anything amazing.<br />

i'm very casual when it comes to pvp...and i really dislike arena's...but srsly, it was painfully obvious to anyone with half a brain watching friends, guildmates, arena leaderboards that GEAR+COMP&gt;&gt;&gt;SKILL 99% of the time in WotLK arena play. If you can't see how this is a positive change for casual and hardcore pvp'ers alike then go play a different game - now it could still end up COMP&gt;SKILL, but it's still one less factor to tip the scales</div></div><hr />

<br />
No cause people will be traveling a lot to level and see the new content. Traveling will be a little bit more of a hassle in Cataclysm since there will be no portals to funnel toons to the most popular cities people will be forced to mount up and travel to their closes capital cities to get things done.</div></div><hr />

Comps have always been like that, you don't expect to run 3 dks in 3vs3 and expect to get high just because you're somewhat skilled. The setup you're running should always present some variety when it comes to crowd control etc. And &quot;GEAR+COMP&gt;&gt;&gt;SKILL&quot; is just not true. If you don't know how to play, for instance, RMP, you won't go any far. But anyhow, I was expecting that from somebody who says that he doesnt like arenas.<br />
<br />
<br />
positive change for casual and hardcore pvp'ers<br />
How can it be a positive change for hardcore pvp'ers to take away what they worked hard to get and that required effort and skill. If it's a change it is def a negative change for hardcore pvp'ers. When it comes to casual pvp'ers I guess it's a positive change since they don't need to be any skilled or put any effort to it to get the gear, and that's my point.<br />
<br />
<br />
go play a different game<br />
What you said on that post was easily debunked due to you're lack of experience when it comes to pvp (arenas).I suggest you get some for yourself before coming here with you're misguided little notion about it. <br />

<br />
Or opposed to your idea that the first to start playing pvp will always have an advantage.. <br />
<br />
You either play pvp to faceroll people with worse gear or play for competition.. You are not going to get competition from other people when you are full seasons ahead of people just starting.. Limiting the rated gear insures more competition and people playing opposed to you annihilating people..<br />

<br />
The only value I can see in having old style portals is in moving between continents. I definitely think each faction's cities should have &quot;sister&quot; cities on the opposite continent so that you can bob between the two without having to wait for a blimp to get to a raid, but that's the only case. Everything else is such a short flight on a 310 mount, there's no point in even bothering with a portal.</div></div><hr />
