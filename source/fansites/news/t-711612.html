Mastery System and PvP Balance<br />
First, it's a powerful new tool, but it's by no means the only tool in the toolbox.<br />
<br />
Second, higher health pools and survivability relative to damage means damage output won't be balanced on the same razor edge in Cataclysm as it is now. When increasing damage by 5% means you knock off 90% of a health pool in five seconds instead of 86%, that's pretty risky. When it means you knock off 40% of a health pool instead of 38%, that's not a real big balance changer. Numbers made up, but that's the general principle.<br />
<br />
Third, a greater focus on large-scale PvP will also probably help moderate the effects of changes like this.<br />
This.<br />
<br />
Pretty sure PvP gear will have mastery.<br />
And this. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24401613123/mastery-sys-won-t-come-close-to-balancing/))<br />
<br />
Tanking is (not) hard!<br />
'm just reading a lot of &quot;tanking is so hard&quot; threads, and A) we don't really agree, and B) if it's any less challenging I fear a lot of tanks may get bored and move on to other classes. There are some annoying parts of tanking we need to fix, and we definitely want to fix the threat scaling problem and any major disparities in AE tanking. But if you're looking for an experience even easier than tanking Naxx, I'm not quite sure how to provide that given my A and B above. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24401521630/twitter-chat-on-warrior-aoe-tanking/))<br />
<br />
Faction equality on servers<br />
The average alliance to horde ratio for Trollbane is 1.08:1. That doesn't take into account things like player participation, character level, interest in certain activities such as world PvP, etc. but the actual ratio is pretty much even.<br />
<br />
We do what we can to encourage faction equality though. If any situations arise that require our intervention we do so. We've had realm transfers that only allow one faction to move, we've shut down character creation for a single faction. We have methods to help balance realms or even battlegroups and we do use them, for all US realms at current and especially in this case though I wouldn't characterize it as needing that level of intervention.

The very best teams will also receive the exclusive Vanquisher title, which can be shared with your high-level characters. All will know of your mighty achievements!<br />
<br />
Stay tuned for more information, including pricing, availability and other details, later this week! (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/13200222384/arena-2010/))<br />

Upgrading the original backpack<br />
We think about this one all the time, be it an upgrade to the backpack, or making it replaceable by larger bags. We'd just have to be careful to not make it possible to have no bags equipped at any given time, because that would get messy. No guarantees on this one, but do know we're considering it. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/12947283189/storage-bag-upgrades/))<br />
<br />
Celestial Steed scaling<br />
We acknowledge that the Celestial Steed can seem a little out of proportion when especially some of the bulkier races are riding it, and this is something that is being looked into. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/13200302232/fix-req-celestial-steed-gfx-and-scaling/))<br />

AE Tanking in Cataclysm<br />
I didn't mean to imply that blowing Intimidating Shout is a swell idea on every AE pull. The context was a scenario that apparently comes up all the time where the warrior has recently used Thunder Clap and Shockwave and a whole lot of Morogrim-style adds pour into the room, leaving the hapless warrior without an AE button to push and solve the whole problem. I was pointing out that there are a lot of things you can do in that situation. Yes, if someone is about to die and you can't wait for Thunder Clap to come back up, then by all means use Intimidating Shout. That's what it's there for.<br />
<br />
We're just not crazy about the sound of any of these ideas that have the warrior able to use Thunder Clap and have it tick away on the mobs or on the ground to make sure things will stick to you no matter what.<br />
<br />
Warriors tanked for years without Shockwave and with a pretty wimpy Thunder Clap that only hit four adds. Yet, they still managed to handle a variety of fights, including this staggered adds situation that is the current hot topic button for this forum. I played a warrior tank a lot in that time period, and yeah, sometimes you lost aggro and sometimes you wiped. It's a lot easier today. I'm not trying to use one of these &quot;back in my day, we tanked uphill in the snow&quot; arguments, but I am trying to get a sense for how easy you really want tanking to be and still have fun doing it.<br />
<br />
(Again, I'm totally bought into the argument that AE tanking on live may not be as easy for warriors as paladins and druids. I'm trying to establish how AE tanking should feel in an absolute, not a relative sense.) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24401521630/twitter-chat-on-warrior-aoe-tanking/))<br />

<br />
This is not a problem at all. The players make this a problem.<br />
<br />
You could just use intimidating shout/taunt and tab single target mobs untill thunder clap or shockwave is off cooldown. If the dps keeps hitting mobs you don't have agro on then that's their mistake and their problem. They could at least stop hitting a mob they pull agro on if they don't have omen (people have it but don't use it) and maybe use a threat dropping skill. And if they are not stupid they can even help you to keep mobs on you with MD and keep them of their selves with crowd control.<br />
<br />
This game becomes more boring if they keep changing things for bad players or new players to make it easier for them. It's the wrong way, they should just learn how to deal with these situations by doing them or by help from others. Blizzard is better off by giving more tips ingame or on the website for new players than giving classes talents or skills that solve mistakes of other players.</div></div><hr />

God sake... Are they REALLY thinking that the situation is not critical? People report a &quot;6 to 1 ratio&quot; and they reply &quot;no, its &quot;1.6 to 1 ratio&quot;. Well then, how the fuck does this explain, that on my realm the entrance to the ICC is crowded with horde in all times of the day? Its like you can come there at 05.00 morning and even then there will surely be some horde. And in same time, there are like 3 or maybe 4 Alliance guilds that are able to periodically collect 25 people online for a raid.<br />
And people keep transferring to the horde side on this realm. Is this REALLY under control and just supposed to be like that?</div></div><hr />

This is the truth, i remember back in the days of Shattered Halls Heroic where i was tanking with my newbie geared warrior 7+ elites with just sunders, thunderclap (hitting 4 targets) and cleave!! Now...THAT was fun and hard! After the introduction of shockwave and the lolnewthunderclap spam, i find warrior tanking a bit boring...you don't even have to fight anymore to keep aggro...how sad :(</div></div><hr />

Tanking is (not) hard!<br />
'm just reading a lot of &quot;tanking is so hard&quot; threads, and A) we don't really agree, and B) if it's any less challenging I fear a lot of tanks may get bored and move on to other classes. There are some annoying parts of tanking we need to fix, and we definitely want to fix the threat scaling problem and any major disparities in AE tanking. But if you're looking for an experience even easier than tanking Naxx, I'm not quite sure how to provide that given my A and B above.

^This, can't see why ppl keep complaining. They're just so damn lazy that they want everything so simple that they actualy have to push 1 button. Then they most likely will just QQ for being to easy.<br />
If u find it hard, look things up, learn and understand. Don't QQ cuz u can't master what your doing.</div></div><hr />

The average alliance to horde ratio for Trollbane is 1.08:1. That doesn't take into account things like player participation, character level, interest in certain activities such as world PvP, etc. but the actual ratio is pretty much even.<br />
<br />
We do what we can to encourage faction equality though. If any situations arise that require our intervention we do so. We've had realm transfers that only allow one faction to move, we've shut down character creation for a single faction. We have methods to help balance realms or even battlegroups and we do use them, for all US realms at current and especially in this case though I wouldn't characterize it as needing that level of intervention.

<br />
<br />
<br />
First off all no they dont, because they get money for faction change and server transfers if the imbalance is high( which in alot of realms it is). Secondly one of the big issues is WG because one faction may never win due to imbalance and we all know that tenacity doesnt help at all.</div></div><hr />

Sadly, I could give a flying f*ck about my Jr./High schools, and the thought of giving them MORE money for them to waste on stupid stuff makes me cringe.<br />
<br />
Although, there was really nothing else to do in that bubble of a town (nothing within 20 miles was open past 9pm) but play video games all weekend, so promoting an MMO to the kids there now probably isn't a terrible idea. Seemed to work peachy for me &gt;.&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Btw, Chrisisvacant, it's cute you think that PVPUSD is a charity. It's a small community of filthy rich conservatives that decided they were too snobby to A) send their kids to private school &amp; B) want anything to do with the LA Unified school district. The parents there are rich enough to send their 16 yr olds to school with brand new corvettes and hire planes to fly around with banners promoting their crappy football teams. They don't need _more_ money--they just need people running the school board that don't flush all of their money down the toilet.<br />

Or give starters a second 6 slot bag. Leveling up is so fast now that it really won't be long before you start feeling the benefits of this, lvl 60 chars having a 20 slot Backpack.<br />

Guitar Hero is not the best selling console game nor franchise of all time if that's what you're trying to state.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kulgro</div><div class="date">2010-04-22, 08:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warrior tanking - I am not sure why people think that warriors have a problem tanking a large number of adds. Really this has never been a problem for me, and if you look at ICC starting trash you can easily see that a warrior has no problem solo tanking every pull in there. I have done this countless times in rep runs and with a bit of help from tott and a MD every now and then I can hold aggro on everything.<br />
<br />
What I find to be the problem is more than anything else is the warrior taunt system and ranged staggered pulls (think adds on 10m TOGC anub). Here is where I see warriors as vastly behind a pally and a DK. The main reason for this is that warriors only have one useful ranged attack (heroic throw) which is on a 1 min CD, what this does is force a warrior to over use taunt as their primary means of picking up adds at range. Being that a warriors taunt does not produce additional threat taunt is a very week way of picking up a wondering add. The only other option I can come up with is the intercept the first and shield slam it, then charge the second add. This system works but is far slower and more complex than using death grip or righteous defense.<br />
<br />
The second problem where a warrior greatly fall behind a pally is in the method of selecting a add. A pally has the option of using grid seeing who has threat and taunting off of a fixed setup. A warrior tank has to select a wondering add via the name plate or by clicking on the target. This is a far more difficult method especially in the case where an add could be obstructed, thus leading to a much greater margin of error (think of all the time you have seen a warrior accidentally taunt anub instead of the add). <br />
<br />
A simple solution that I would love to see implemented would be to have intervene taunt the attacking targets similar to righteous defense. This could be done though a glyph so that it could be removed on fights where a tank would intervene another tank. This would give warriors a more exacting taunt system which could be used at a range (or at least initially) and would limit the amount of stance change that would have to be done in a pve setting.</div></div><hr />

Modern Warfare 2 did however break so many sales records it was almost to good to be true. And that game alone and it's sales is enough to keep Activision wealthy and suffer no problems. Top that of with what they make on WoW and other big names in their game lineup.</div></div><hr />

Modern Warfare, sadly, is.<br />
<br />
However, even if GH's popularity is fading, I'm serious when I say it earned them so much money that I've ready articles stating &quot;GH won't go so good this year and probably earn them less than 500 millions&quot;.<br />

It's possible that WoW is their single biggest economy entry (expecially when you consider it's basically cost-free for them now), but if you think Activision lives or dies on WoW you're delusional.</div></div><hr />

Modern warfare 2 is &quot;only&quot; ranked as the fourth best selling video game of all times according to a list NPD posted january 2010. Guitar Hero III: Legends of rock is ranked as the second best selling game of all time. Wii Play is ranked as the best selling game. Another notable games on that list is Modern Warfare, Call of duty: World at war. That means Activision has 4 games amongst the top 10 selling games of all time.<br />
<br />
NPD's tracking only goes back to 1995 however. So I'm still fairly confident Super mario Bros still is the single best selling video game of all time(roughly 40 million copies is hard to beat).<br />
<br />
But anywhos, this goes to show I doubt Activision/Blizzard is struggling for cash.</div></div><hr />

Its like you can come there at 05.00 morning and even then there will surely be some horde. And in same time, there are like 3 or maybe 4 Alliance guilds that are able to periodically collect 25 people online for a raid.<br />
And people keep transferring to the horde side on this realm. Is this REALLY under control and just supposed to be like that?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulika</div><div class="date">2010-04-22, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">About time Blizzard finally came out and said that maybe some tanks just suck. There is not a single encounter in the game that is difficult to tank as a warrior right now and it is sickening to see tanking getting dumbed down over and over again because of fail tanks who constantly cry about how hard it is for them.<br />
<br />
I suspect I am not alone in being pretty sickened at how faceroll a lot of tanking has become. Nearly every single boss is a single target fight, no kiting required, taunt switching being the only mechanic needed. Single target threat generation is a joke for all tanks, AoE threat generation is also a joke for all classes, yeah warrior has to work harder but I don't buy the argument that warrior is less effective because of it.<br />
<br />
People don't realise that warrior tanking is about the only fun tank spec if you like a more hectic pace. Yes a paladin can do just as well with a simple fixed rotation but paladin tanking is boring as hell. If you want that playstyle then roll a paladin, crying and crying to have warrior tank turned into a paladin tank misses the entire point. The reason warrior is fun is because it is different, because you have to work at it, because you have to tab target, cleave spam, use 20 different abilities, watch threat levels on every single mob etc. Turning warrior AoE into paladin AoE with different ability names would be stupid.</div></div><hr />

The only time I've ever had trouble is when I was tanking ICC in 232 gear for my guild in 264 gear. I was outgeared by a mile and so was my threat gen. Anywhere else Cleave, TC, Revenge, Shockwave - and OMG, TABBING between targets and Devastating - is more than enough to never lose aggro. Clicking your skills is bad mmk.</div></div><hr />

Back in the days of before Faction Change, Alliance and Horde would own Wintergrasp a fairly even amount, it was rare for either to win more than two times in a row.<br />
<br />
Post-Faction Change, The Alliance would be lucky to own it 10 times over the period of a week. The remaining 46 times it remains Horde controlled, up to 6-7 times in a row they will win. Only during the off-peak hours do the Alliance win, other than Tuesday.<br />
<br />
The Horde:Alliance Ratio seems like 4:1, every single Wintergrasp the Alliance has 8-20 Tenacity, And we all know that Tenacity doesn't do shit for being locked down by a dozen enemies stunning, silencing, disarming and outright rolling your increased health pool while you sit there and cant fight back. Not only this but we don't have the numbers to defend workshops,towers, tanks and attack the walls.<br />

Sucks. Our server's more or less the same, except the Alliance vastly outnumber us. We're lucky if we can even win Wintergrasp at 3AM, but come on during midday, early evening or even late morning, and we have 20 stacks of Tenacity, and we're still unable to kill more than 6 of them before 12 come to take their place.<br />

<br />
<br />
There are three fact being ignored here:<br />
<br />
1) Blizzard has this information and you don't. Whatever your personal perception is, Blizzard sees the actual characters created on each faction and each server. Now, as they say, they can't account for people who do or don't participate in WG, people who play less often than other people, end-game ready characters vs others, etc; but they can say that the ratio of characters is close to even. It's probably not as close on every server as it is on the one they listed, but that was clearly a server that someone felt was uneven, and it's clearly not. There's nothing Blizzard can do about the rest. If people on your faction hate PvP, or never play, or are all lvl 10, it's not Blizzard's fault, nor can they fix it.<br />
<br />
2) Perception is not reality. On my server it seems like we never have WG Alliance side. I've gone whole weeks where I never got to run VOA. Now, I work &quot;normal&quot; hours 8-5 M-F (yes, I'm at work right now, what's your point :-)). I've long heard that Alliance actually has WG most of the time during the work week. Alliance has more stay at home moms, unemployed people, or something on my server apparently. I've never really bought this, clearly we never win WG, because I've never seen us win WG (or at least not often). Yesterday I stayed home from work with a sick dog. Damned if we didn't have WG for most of the day<br />
<br />
3) Serious PvPers want to win. It's a sad fact of life that people who are serious about something will seize any advantage they can get. Other people probably won't bother. This is a far more likely explanation than a true server imbalance for how often you are outnumbered. Let's say there are 15,000 lvl 80 toons on your server. I think this is considered a &quot;mid-pop&quot; or even &quot;low-pop&quot; number. Let's say at the time of faction transfers being implemented it was a 50/50 split. So 7,500 each faction. When faction xfers went live 200 of the best Alliance PvPers went Horde. Now it's a 51/49 split on actual population. Hardly any change at all; but when you go to WG it's going to make a huge difference wouldn't you say? Alliance has lost probably most of its good PvPer, and Horde has gained all of them. Faction balance on the server stayed almost the same.</div></div><hr />

Right, well, the problem is that there is no &quot;base race&quot; for the celestial steed. And it costs 25 bucks, just to look cool. So if it doesn't look cool, you've got a problem.</div></div><hr />

Have a look at that. Drak'thul has the lowest population of all the wow servers. There is 1 guild there that's clearing content and the rest have transferred off. It's in a really sad state. Server morale is really low, and you can't even find a decent pug with all the bads. Alliance side doesn't even try to find pugs. Horde side tries...and fails. I say to blizz, put up or shut up. If you say you fix things when they go wrong, Drak'thul is VERY wrong right now.</div></div><hr />

As a warrior, I just want to address the ones that keep asking the blues about AoE tanking OVER and OVER: STOP, for the love of god. Most of us play the class for the sole reason that it has the most mechanically demanding tanking style of all the tank classes, and we ENJOY that &quot;challenge&quot;. Don't water it down for the rest of us just because you can't AoE tank, while for &quot;the rest of us&quot; it is god damn easy with a bit of experience.. Seriously, this is getting ridiculous, this discussion has been dragged on since Blizzcon 09, you are starting to sound like ret paladins after nerfing in WotLK release, when AoE tanking is going to get easier anyways.</div></div><hr />

The American (http://www.blizzard.com/us/inblizz/fanart/) and European (http://eu.blizzard.com/en-gb/community/fanart/index.html) Blizzard Fan Art Section have been updated with 4 Fan Arts. Warning: You might want to delete all your Horde characters and reroll Alliance after that. <br />

Sorry there Boub, but so long as King Varian Chin and Shaman exist on the Alliance ill never betray the Horde. :)</div></div><hr />

Nah, but they are far from inept if you *gasp* know how to play your class with any modicum of skill. I have tanks in all 4 classes, and warrior is by far my favorite to play (followed by bear simply for the dance!!) If they dumb it down, that will be a sad panda face indeed.</div></div><hr />

It's a small community of filthy rich conservatives that decided they were too snobby to A) send their kids to private school &amp; B) want anything to do with the LA Unified school district. The parents there are rich enough to send their 16 yr olds to school with brand new corvettes and hire planes to fly around with banners promoting their crappy football teams. They don't need _more_ money--they just need people running the school board that don't flush all of their money down the toilet.r.<br />

<br />
pretty much this..<br />
<br />
The Peninsula Education Foundation was founded in 1979. We’re a non-profit group dedicated to keeping the Palos Verdes Peninsula schools among the top in the nation.<br />
<br />
now looking at the Palos Verdes Peninsula schools.<br />
<br />
&quot;The city is served by Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District. PVPUSD schools have constantly ranked among the best in California and the nation. &quot;<br />
<br />
looking at real estate prices in that area..Median home price is a cool $1,100,000. .<br />
<br />
Looks like a pretty nice place to live?? There are four cities nestled here: Palos Verdes Estates, Rancho Palos Verdes, Rolling Hills and Rolling Hills Estates. All cities are affluent and served by the Palos Verdes Unified School District with scores in the 90s and high 90th percentile, often the highest in the state. Crime is extremely low to none. <br />

'm just reading a lot of &quot;tanking is so hard&quot; threads, and A) we don't really agree, and B) if it's any less challenging I fear a lot of tanks may get bored and move on to other classes. There are some annoying parts of tanking we need to fix, and we definitely want to fix the threat scaling problem and any major disparities in AE tanking. But if you're looking for an experience even easier than tanking Naxx, I'm not quite sure how to provide that given my A and B above. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24401521630/twitter-chat-on-warrior-aoe-tanking/))<br />
<br />
It's times like these that I'm glad Blizzard has the presence of mind to ignore a lot of the &quot;feedback&quot; they get from the community. Because at this point I'm really just not sure how much easier tanking could get. Barring a fight like Hodir, no tank nowadays has to worry about threat. Ever. AoE or single-target.<br />
<br />
And for that matter, I've never understood how Warrior AoE tanking was hard once TC had its threat buffed and its target limit removed. Having to hit your TC button at intervals certainly requires (slightly) more effort than a fire-and-forget AoE like Consecration or (what I suspect most people are thinking about when they write these posts) Death and Decay, but that doesn't make it hard.<br />
<br />
Faction equality on servers<br />
The average alliance to horde ratio for Trollbane is 1.08:1. That doesn't take into account things like player participation, character level, interest in certain activities such as world PvP, etc. but the actual ratio is pretty much even.<br />
<br />
We do what we can to encourage faction equality though. If any situations arise that require our intervention we do so. We've had realm transfers that only allow one faction to move, we've shut down character creation for a single faction. We have methods to help balance realms or even battlegroups and we do use them, for all US realms at current and especially in this case though I wouldn't characterize it as needing that level of intervention. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24401903025/when-is-blizzard-going-to-learn/))<br />
<br />
I'm not sure I buy their argument that realms are inherently balanced. True, we as the consumer community don't have access to all of the internal data mining that Blizzard does, but that also means that they can pick and choose the data to reveal to us and the context in which to reveal it. Personally, I've been on a lot of different servers and most, if not all of them, have had activity ratios of at least A 1.0:1.5 H according to the census, and that .5 is a big deal when you're dealing with thousands or tens of thousands of people.<br />
<br />
The good news is, I think a lot of that will balance itself out in Cataclysm because I expect that current Horde players will be switching factions in droves in order to roll worgen.</div></div><hr />

EDIT: There is actually a LOT of crime here, surprisingly. The cops just overlook the adolescent felonies because Mommy and Daddy can afford great lawyers. I'm from San Pedro, just across the street from RPV, so I know whussup. <br />
<br />
The school's around here have cut their amount of teachers by like 30%, and both the major high schools have had to cut a good amount of electives.<br />
<br />
In addition to that, the other school, Rancho Del Mar, is suffering even more from the drawbacks. Kids who've been expelled from Pen and PV, as well as kids with learning disabilities, attend this school. This school district is suffering profusely from the budget cuts, despite being located in such a rich area.</div></div><hr />

The context was a scenario that apparently comes up all the time where the warrior has recently used Thunder Clap and Shockwave and a whole lot of Morogrim-style adds pour into the room, leaving the hapless warrior without an AE button to push and solve the whole problem. I was pointing out that there are a lot of things you can do in that situation. Yes, if someone is about to die and you can't wait for Thunder Clap to come back up, then by all means use Intimidating Shout. That's what it's there for.<br />
<br />
<br />
Am I the only one who caught that he may have meant challenging shout? Intimidating is a fear bomb used for cc when appropriate and fucking up pulls when not. Challenging is the aoe taunt..gg gms..</div></div><hr />

When two bidders place the same Maximum Bid, the first bid placed becomes the Tie Winner.

<br />
All Blizzard really has to do is make it so you can't delete your 1st slot bag (the one where the back-pack is equipped by default), but still allow it to be switched with other bags.</div></div><hr />

For those who live outside of Southern California Pales Verdes is not exactly a crappy area to live in.<br />
<br />
Yes these schools have insanely high scores, but I am pretty sure that income and location have to do with that. It's a very wealthy community.<br />
<br />
I kinda feel it's &quot;making the rich richer&quot;. It's like if they held a charity for Beverly Hills school district or some of the South O.C's school districts I mean Blizzard could at least had the charity help other places that are in much need of funding. Long Beach is right next door and South Central L.A isn't very far either. I am pretty sure the parents of the children who do go to the Pales Verdes school district make enough income to help their children succeed, or any expenses they might have in school.</div></div><hr />

Ugh.<br />

Did you know that if you crack open and use the very very rare signed collectors editions, you're doing it wrong?<br />

I like their charity thing, they need to do more of those. I was a little saddened that my mount+XT pet didn't go at least partially (come on, 5% to whatever, they pulled like 2 mill in 3 hours or some stupid amount) to charity. That way we could also have said to the &quot;Mount for Cash zomg Ruining game&quot; complainers that they didn't like starving children everywhere or whatever. People may have also made the purchase since it went to charity in some part instead of leaving their credit cards in their wallets.</div></div><hr />

Fact: Try to ae tank in an actual gear equiped group as a warrior. Have fun.... It will in no means work !<br />
<br />
As a Paladin or druid or Dk it will work with no effort. Now Blizzard explain that to me. I don´t want tanking to be ridiculous but for ridiculous trash it should be a piece of cake. That simpel...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We can't even kill Putricide in 25 man and our warrior tanks all vehemently disagree with you.<br />
<br />
It may sound hypocritical (but the good players we have can't carry the 10 or 15 who have no clue what SA is, so it really isn't), but stop being bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
About the Celestial Steed, I dont like it have same small size as other normal horses, most of us likes big mounts, just like Gnomes on a Chopper, there Chopper is scaled alittle bigger then other char on same Chopper ;-)<br />
a 10% bigger scaled steed would be better, and then i dont like the wings on it, they to small, they should be more DOMINANT &quot;showoff&quot;.<br />

Think also about some of the famous people who play this game, musicians, actors (and people in movies, yes you Vin Diesel) and wealthy business people for whom 4-5k is pocket change. It's quite likely that late into the bidding there will be some pretty hefty bids from those holding back for now, just for the charity.<br />

How much did the Frostmourne replica go for at auction? $20k?</div></div><hr />
