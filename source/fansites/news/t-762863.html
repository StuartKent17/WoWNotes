In a nutshell, you can now use the Mobile Armory to discuss on your guild chat, the offer is bundled with the remote AH and will cost you $2,99 a month. <br />
We're pleased to announce a new feature being added to the Mobile Armory: Guild Chat!<br />
<br />
Coming soon in an update to the Mobile Armory app available in the iTunes App Store (http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=321057000&amp;mt=8 ) and Android Market, this new feature will allow all World of Warcraft Remote subscribers the ability to chat with their guildies right from their mobile device. Access to the guild chat feature is included for no extra charge in the $2.99 World of Warcraft Remote Auction House ( http://www.wowarmory.com/wow-remote.xml ) premium monthly subscription. In addition, soon after the launch of the mobile version we're planning on adding the ability for premium subscribers to use Guild Chat through any browser on the Armory website.<br />
<br />
Guild Chat will allow you to chat with your guildmates via Guild Chat, Officer Chat, and Whispers. Now you can stay connected with your guild or update them from anywhere if you're going to be late to a raid! Stay tuned for additional information about this service and the upcoming Mobile Armory Guild Chat beta test.</div></div><hr />

I'm glad they're bringing it to the mobile armory, but I do have 2 points:<br />
<br />
1) There should be a web-based version that is free to all subscribers. That way I don't need an iPhone to chat with my guildies who are in game and I'm not. <br />
<br />
2) Will you be able to delv items, achievements, etc., and highlight them through the app? That's a key feature.</div></div><hr />

Now I'm not saying paying for services is wrong, i fully support the &quot;mobile armory&quot; and the remote auction house and whatnot costing money but this function is clearly something that should be free with a small IM styled battle.net integrated software</div></div><hr />

Least they could do if they're going to slap this crap into their own platforms so late is steal Everquest 2's mentoring system, which is completely awesome. Of course, they'd probably try to charge an extra 2.99 a month to let people use that too.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
To be fair to them, the MOBILE ability to chat is new, but it's not that different from the web-based interface that allows the same (and greater) funtionality in other mmo's, as far as i'm concerned. I really liked being able to open a web page and chat with friends who were off and playing in those games when I wasn't, but it really sucks that they're charging for this simple service by rolling it into the dang armory app. <br />
<br />
I'm not going to call it greedy or anything, since it's just smart business on their part, but that doesn't mean I have to like it =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I was seriously raiding in BC and Wrath, I had only one guildie's number, a friends. I would call him and hope to God he would be raiding that night to inform the raid I was in traffic and would be hedging raid-time. I was a resist tank for Hydross, so it was kind of important. Sometimes it would be hit or miss.<br />

This addition is a good thing, and its included in the Remote AH functionality, isn't it?</div></div><hr />

They added the feature for free to the mobile auction house. Which is 100% optional if you want to pay 2.99 for it. You're not entitled to anything. Don't use it if you don't like it, or pay if it's worth it. This could be useful to let guild know that you're running late to a raid or whatever. It's not a bad feature. if you don't want to pay for mobile features, then don't. It's not that difficult. I like how everyone makes Blizzard out to be the bad guy, no matter what they do. Yet you keep giving them $15 a month. Stop looking for stuff to complain about and simply don't use the feature if you don't want it. <br />
<br />
To me, the remote stuff is not worth the money yet...for my style of play. If they keep adding these simple useful features, I could see buying it in the future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're butthurt by the fact that you respond with this vile drivel. I also find it humorous that you condemn his opinion of nobody caring, only to force your own opinion expecting him to accept you know, care. <br />
<br />
It's also &quot;I couldn't care less&quot;. If you want to demonstrate intelligence, it's good to at least pretend you are.</div></div><hr />

Might be a blessing in disguise, if they lose their job from ignorance it means they can't pay for their subscription and thus will be less morons running around the game.</div></div><hr />

It's not a paid service, the mobile auction house is, it's just being tagged on.<br />

Not to mention, if you have a phone capable of accessing the interwebs like most of us do now, it'll be free, they said shortly after release you can use guild chat from the armory website. Just navigate their on your phone and take advantage, no payment necessary. Or they could mean that you can only use that if you have the mobile ah app too...

^ This. Don't think that just because Blizz CAN make a feature, that they should give it to you for free just because you think you deserve it. This is so non-essential, but a cool tool to have if you want to pay for it. It's like a sun roof for your car.

<br />
The problem with making it cost money is that most people won't bother with it, which means that ultimately it's of little value. Being able to chat at work with my guild who are all at work is mildly useful, except for the fact that they also would need this service in order to chat back. I understand that development costs money, and Blizzard wants to make money, but this seems like yet another lame Battle.net 2.0 idea that offers very little real value.<br />
<br />
There's a reason why instant messengers and other social media sites are all free, because you need a critical mass of people before they have any real value. This idea would be a very useful one if it were FREE and it if were tied to the actual armory and not the &quot;mobile armory.&quot; Any phone sophisticated enough to handle a real app is sophisticated enough to browse a real web page.<br />
<br />
Then again this is a problem with content providers in general who develop mobile Apps. ESPN.com wants to sell me a five dollar app for my Droid that would allow me to update my teams from my phone. Doesn't sound too bad until you realize that I can just go to ESPN.com and do that for free, with a greater selection of features and no need to download a buggy app. It seems like in general, developers don't grasp the concept that any thing that's not tied to the phone user's current location can probably be done more easily through a web page than through an app any way.</div></div><hr />

The problem with making it cost money is that most people won't bother with it, which means that ultimately it's of little value. Being able to chat at work with my guild who are all at work is mildly useful, except for the fact that they also would need this service in order to chat back. I understand that development costs money, and Blizzard wants to make money, but this seems like yet another lame Battle.net 2.0 idea that offers very little real value.<br />
<br />
There's a reason why instant messengers and other social media sites are all free, because you need a critical mass of people before they have any real value. This idea would be a very useful one if it were FREE and it if were tied to the actual armory and not the &quot;mobile armory.&quot; Any phone sophisticated enough to handle a real app is sophisticated enough to browse a real web page.<br />
<br />
Then again this is a problem with content providers in general who develop mobile Apps. ESPN.com wants to sell me a five dollar app for my Droid that would allow me to update my teams from my phone. Doesn't sound too bad until you realize that I can just go to ESPN.com and do that for free, with a greater selection of features and no need to download a buggy app. It seems like in general, developers don't grasp the concept that any thing that's not tied to the phone user's current location can probably be done more easily through a web page than through an app any way.<br />
<br />
Um, they don't need it to chat back or that'd defeat the purpose. It will allow you to see in-game guild chat and allow you to chat on your phone just as if you were logged in on your comp.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what the rest of your rant was about since I stopped reading after this completely made up assumption, but I'm sure it was probably just as inaccurate and pointless.</div></div><hr />

I believe what he was trying to say is that while he is at work, his fellow guildies are also at work, meaning that guild chat is empty when he is at work. If that was his point however, he makes the logical fallacy of assuming that because he is in such a situation, that it somehow applies to all WoW players. I know that in my case, there are guildies on at all hours of the day. When I go to bed after raiding, some guildies in other time zones are on for another 8 hours afterward. Even if it were just to come on nights I couldn't raid and find out how they're doing, it would be worth it. This is the feature I've been waiting years for. Yes, a free web version would be great, but I will give them credit where credit is due, this is a feature well worth $3 a month.</div></div><hr />

People who are getting this seriously need to ween themselves a little bit.<br />
<br />
When I'm not playing WoW, I want nothing to do with it. I could see maybe if it was free but paying for it? Blizzard is trying to make our accounts more expensive 3 bucks at a time. Who's gonna be a sheep and follow the herd? I don't think so.<br />
<br />
You gotta love dorks like this, who think they are some sort of WOW rebel.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? A paid service??? Forget that! I'm not a sheep! Blizzard isn't getting my money!&quot;<br />
&quot;Welcome to Gamestop!&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, I'd like Cataclysm and a $30 game card, please.&quot;<br />

&quot;Alright, just logged off WOW, now I want nothing to do with it... hmmm what's on mmo-champion?&quot;<br />

At the end of the day it's an additional service which gives you no in-game advantage.<br />
<br />
Remove auction housing, however, does give you a huge advantage over people without the program. This advantage has the potential to be big enough that anyone playing the &quot;Auction House Game&quot; will not be able to compete with those who have the program without having the program themselves (or never logging off).<br />

Hey stupid retard #45967 the guild chat app... is free it is getting added to the armory app. Go look up the price of the armory app. I know reading comprehension takes a backseat to seeing what you want to see but at least try a little bit harder. The 2.99$ auction house app is getting the guild chat app added on for no additional cost. You do not need to have the auction house app to use guild chat the armory app will do that.</div></div><hr />

If you honestly want to text or chat with your guild mates wouldn't you ALREADY have their phone numbers?<br />
<br />
Do your mobile phones have the ability to already text and chat? Oh... Okay then. <br />
<br />
...So why are you going to pay blizzard for an application to do that?<br />
<br />
You're going to pay blizzard for the service to already do what a phone does in the first place. Brilliant.<br />
<br />
There are a number of guildies I want to chat with, and I have given exactly zero of them my phone number.<br />
<br />
I have the unlimited data plan for my iPhone but I do not have unlimited texting.<br />
<br />
Some guildies are minors and in this day and time i do not want their phone number or my number in theirs.<br />
<br />
I have an iPad next to my computer. This will allow me to see guild chat for guild#1 while being logged into an alt.<br />
<br />

Hello random moron who I care about less then I do about my shit. I made a typo by writing AH where I should have written armory. But I won't change it anymore, because it gives lifeless people like you some purpose in life.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Joking aside, I see one good use of this. Being able to inform guild if you internet goes out during a raid or if your computer blew up or something. =P</div></div><hr />

If your computer blows up don't you think you might have pressing matters to attend to other than WoW. I know it is just an example, but I hold it as an example too. An example of how some people have become so wrapped up in the game...I think I might see a WoW Bible in the making. <br />

For a moment it sounded as if you implied that writing with people you've never met in a video game is the same as having them text you outside the game in your real life.<br />
<br />
I see this feature as a way of joining a chat room on Blizzard's hosting, and the first alternate method of sending in-game messages without needing to log into World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
I see this feature becoming a hilarious target of harassment if someone's iPhone is stolen. In fact, on the next Blizzcon, be sure to look for some of the top end raiding guild's phones and snatch one to write &quot;WAZZAAAP&quot; in their highly restricted guild chat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do your mobile phones have the ability to already text and chat? Oh... Okay then. <br />
<br />
...So why are you going to pay blizzard for an application to do that?<br />
<br />
You're going to pay blizzard for the service to already do what a phone does in the first place. Brilliant.<br />

The premium auction house app, which is the only one costing money, is getting it as a bonus!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
So if all you care about is the guild chat feature go get the FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE armory app.<br />
<br />
http://itunes.apple.com/app/world-warcraft-mobile-armory/id321057000?mt=8<br />
<br />
The chat will be accessible through the WoW Remote Armory App yes. But you need to be a Remote subscriber to use it and you don't subscribe to the armory, you subscribe to the Remote Auction House. Thus it's not free.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's not a paid service, the mobile auction house is, it's just being tagged on.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, if you have a phone capable of accessing the interwebs like most of us do now, it'll be free, they said shortly after release you can use guild chat from the armory website. Just navigate their on your phone and take advantage, no payment necessary. Or they could mean that you can only use that if you have the mobile ah app too... I don't know, vague on that point.<br />
It is still a paid service. Just because of the reason that it's tagged on to the mobile auction house is what makes it a paid service. IE: If you only have the mobile armory and want the chat you need to subscribe to the auction house as well to get it, thus being paid for.<br />
That being said, according to other peoples replys this sort of chat function through the mobile seem to be already accessible for other mmo-games for free. This is what makes them call Blizzard greedy for adding it to something that requires payment to be used.<br />
<br />
As for the other thing. They will probably require the computer to have some thing installed on it to be able to use the browser version. Something that no mobile is currently able to handle.</div></div><hr />

Because apparently arenanet/ncsoft hadn't finished the technology. Once they did it was just a simple act of &quot;borrowing&quot; that technology, and poof blizz makes an announcement. I seriously don't think that's what happened. Though I do get meh about blizz &quot;borrowing&quot; so much from other games. Doesn't seem fair how it is in the game market. <br />
<br />
1. If a game company announces their &quot;next cool thing&quot; wow copies it, and integrates it. <br />
2. If they don't, the fans are like &quot;wth X Company, why aren't you giving us any info&quot;<br />
<br />
WoW is the Borg of MMOs. Resistance is futile, you will be assimilated.</div></div><hr />

As raid leader I do share one mobile number for raiders to message me in extra cases. And that works just fine, coz those cases doesn't happen every-raid-day. 0-3 times in a month, so it costs them arround 5 us-cents for international sms. If someone is late all the time or his connection drops often, i would kick him anyway.<br />
No practical use imho. Maybe role players will see a point in it.</div></div><hr />

Your post made me laugh lol.. Last time i checked in eu servers where I am playing there are French germans Swedish greeks dutch english etc etc etc.. Do you know how much it would cost me to MSG them or call them all??? Think before posting! You buy the app once and the everything is free.. Jesus.. Brain activity: nill</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Asheowyn</div><div class="date">2011-04-08, 01:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So $3 a month to talk to the guild, something which should be free.<br />
<br />
Damn, blizzard are getting greedy.<br />
<br />
Agree.. this should just be a little present to us all instead of a new way to make some more money. The AH might still cost that; fine. Mobile AH can actually be an advantage, but I dont see any real point in having guildchat available on mobiles; other than saving some text/phone costs that you'd normally make when you really need to talk to a guildie or in-game buddy.</div></div><hr />
