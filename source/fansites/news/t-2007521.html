<br />
Mostly. They are going out every week or so it seems. Each region looks like it is getting a day. It also depends on what they are testing and sadly how many people they have been removing from the beta for violating various TOS agreements / harassing players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Servers are currently down for me, but listed. It could be a &quot;tweak&quot; build with a lot of bug fixes and a few little things here and there, like reverts to talent changes. Along with their special announcement that is supposed to be happening Friday, I'm going to say they are ending the scenarios / pre-patch stuff and hopefully this is the final build that has those in it. Meaning character copies could be coming up or coming up soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kinda of a large build. Hopefully more damage tuning to make DPS specs to actually do something. Kinda depressing when Healers can out DPS the Damage roles.</div></div><hr />

Well they changed it. It started as being a function of the Miners, then changed to become a function of the level 2 mine in 6.1.</div></div><hr />

They have been trying to push normal modes for that playerbase, they even removed mechanics to help that group move into normal modes.<br />
<br />
Why would the LFR crew even go into normal mode if they could get the same gear in LFR?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because after 2 weeks, you'll need ilevel 9000 to even get invited into the &quot;easy running pugs&quot;, while you in LFR just sign up and go whenever you want. Besides that, loads of people dont wanna be part of raiding-guilds, just wanna collect some gear and do this fast and easy... not spending unnecessary time on wipes... Yes yes, &quot;normal is easy you scrub&quot;, still LFR is easier and faster... normal gives nothing... either you're a relaxed player doing LFR or you probably are up at HC/Mythic and raiding seriously! Normal has NO place in Wow anymore!</div></div><hr />

its called having problems with reading comprehension -_- - if you see a new beta build its logical to assume that those would concern t19 in legion i didnt notice its t17 and t18 im dumb which i guess makes me fit as lfr target audience ^^</div></div><hr />

Speaking as a Reddit fag who plays Havoc in the beta, you'll be surprised at how active they are if you want to do optimal dps. There are other classes with less intuitive rotations.</div></div><hr />

... So LFR is back to the craptastic generic set bonuses that are so generic they make boring look fun. And look, I was right about VERSATILITY being one of the set bonuses for many of the 2-pcs. But hey, now it's a % increase instead of a craptastic static increase. That makes it so much more FUN, right? Yay? :rolleyes: Ugh. Yet another expansion where LFR people are treated as second class citizens. I thought we moved past this with the civil rights movement in the 1960s or even more recently the gay marriage debate. No one should be kept from getting something because of how they play. Blacks shouldn't have been kept from voting, going to white schools, eating in white restaurants, etc just for being black. Gays shouldn't be kept from being married just because their partner is the same sex as them. So why are LFR players being kept from real set bonuses that make things more interesting when they play LFR? This is BLATANT discrimination! And Blizzard should be ashamed they're PROMOTING IT!<br />
<br />
And don't say LFR can just step up into normal. Blacks could have made their own voting venues and attempted to get officials to count their votes. Blacks could have gone to their own schools. Blacks could eat at a different restaurant. Gays could just go to another county to get married, too. All of that they actually did but it didn't make it right. It's the PRINCIPLE of the matter. EQUALITY. Is it too much to ask for? Why the hell are some group forced to jump through more hoops to get the same respect as another group? This is downright insulting, especially in the 21st century.</div></div><hr />

Blacks could eat at a different restaurant. Gays could just go to another county to get married, too. All of that they actually did but it didn't make it right. It's the PRINCIPLE of the matter. EQUALITY. Is it too much to ask for? Why the hell are some group forced to jump through more hoops to get the same respect as another group? This is downright insulting, especially in the 21st century.<br />

HAHAHHAHA no way you're not serious. You can't be. You're comparing lfr players to black people pre civil rights?! You're trolling. You have to be. Theres no other option.</div></div><hr />

The item level requirement or achievement has been a problem with pugs forever, nothing to do with LFR. It's not a problem if you use sites like OpenRaid where people can see your history.<br />

But I'm not sure I agree normal modes are harder than LFR, I have wiped more on LFR than normal modes.</div></div><hr />

Wrong comparision. A game usually has a goal, and reaching that goal should be a challange, otherwise it is not a &quot;game&quot; by definiton, but rather brainless timesink, like games on facebook.<br />
<br />
The problem is that toxic WoW community, otherwise less skillfull players wouldn't have such problems to get the jump into normal.</div></div><hr />

Gays shouldn't be kept from being married just because their partner is the same sex as them. So why are LFR players being kept from real set bonuses that make things more interesting when they play LFR? This is BLATANT discrimination!

Did you honestly just say that? Without reading the tier we're on, without doing any work besides looking at the set and drawing conclusions. Not only that, but then you compare a subset of the game to the struggles of an entire race? Could you face your peers and parents after having said what might be the STUPIDEST FUCKING THING I HAVE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE. HOLY SHIT. IT'S NOT THE TROLLS. IT'S NOT THE WHINERS. IT'S YOU. HOLY SHIT.<br />
The youtube video that Kaedis linked is such an appropriate response to what might be the stupidest comment on June 8, 2016. I really believe, that out of 7.4 Billion People, whom include the mentally challenged, yours absolutely wins the prize for stupidest thought/comment. Congratulations. Never breed.<br />

Excuse me for not contributing to the discussion, it was too much to see that sort of retardation. <br />
<br />
For Arms Warriors, the change to Tactician will undoubtedly proc Colossus Smash more, because it is 0.65/rage on any ability. So Whirlwind will probably be the best option to proc the Reset on CS and give a free mortal strike. This is very similar to the HFC class trinket for arms warrior, and the tier 18 four piece effect where your CS and mortal strike are being constantly reset. Except now it's from rage spent, so the spec might become very fast paced, especially in a battle cry window. I wonder if haste will make an emergence.</div></div><hr />

I have also been impressed with the music tidbits to date. They do seem to have some great emotional weight to them. It will be interesting to hear them in context with the game play. I have every intention of having the music on while leveling and questing. Even now I still play the music in raid, just really quiet in the background.</div></div><hr />

I'm replying to you as a huge advocate for LFR and also one who despises it. While I would rather flay the skin off with a brick, I'm of the thought that LFR is a valuable piece of the game. I'm also the GM of one of the only Heroic raiding guilds on my server (horde side). <br />
<br />
You said &quot;loads of people dont wanna be part of raiding-guilds, just wanna collect some gear and do this fast and easy&quot;. <br />
<br />
That's exactly why LFR exists. It's easy. It's fast and there are very few wipes. The gear that you obtain from it is perfect for it. <br />
<br />
Normal also has its place and the step up in difficulty isn't actually that big. Considering the amount of mouth breathers in LFR, Normal may actually be easier than LFR in my opinion. All you need is 10 people you trust. 2 tanks, 3 healers and 5 DPS. It shouldn't be that hard to find 9 other people of like mind. <br />
<br />
We ended at 3/13 Mythic in HFC and we only raided 2 days a week all through progression. If you put your mind to it, you can easily make that step up from LFR and GET the gear set bonuses that you want.</div></div><hr />

I'll surely not lock down evenings to do some shitty normal raiding when I do pretty much the same, whenever I feel like it, and faster, via LFR!<br />
<br />
Nope, guilds are not something that feels mandatory anymore, locking down evenings is FAR from what loads of us like (it worked in vanilla when we were younger and had time, now lots of us are even parents) so yeah... Normal is dead, it's LFR or push Mythic.. everything in between is kinda useless and a waste of time spend imho!</div></div><hr />

I understand the nerf to Glacial Spike damage because it hits so hard, but why take away the increased Icicle damage? It wasn't an overwhelming amount and you had this beautiful talent synergy that had never been there before. It was so much fun building up icicles and then launching them in one huge blast. I know it's still there obviously, but the legs have been knocked out from under it. Now I don't really see the point in Glacial Spike at all. Without the increase from Lonely Winter the numbers just won't be enough to warrant using it. (I know the artifact tree grants icicles some buffs, but that is down the road) <br />
I hope to see Icicles return to Lonely Winter. We talk about talent groupings that you have a choice in, but then they get taken away.</div></div><hr />
