You guys really need to upgrade your computers. Seriously. Modern technology has added this cool feature to the computer now. Its called VOLUME CONTROL. Yea. Its great. You turn it down or off if you dont want to hear sounds. Personally I like the opening and the sound. It adds to the whole ambiance.</div></div><hr />

If it does sound stupid, I'll just change the sound it uses to a Jurassic park T-rex sound and twik it to make it sound awesome with it!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
P.S How do you want his roar to sound, think about it logically, his Jaw is heavy and massive, and it looks like he has a throat full of inferno.. of course it is going to be muffled/hoarse/hard to get out, plus as per cinematic he has just come to rest , and is probably more grunting/huffy whatever you wanna call it, as he is out of breath from flying.</div></div><hr />

Because having Sindragosa annoy the living shit out of me for 2 years just wasn't enough. What happend to just having a simple background with awesome music added to it? The vanilla and TBC one was so epic I sometimes just listened to the music for a couple of minutes before I logged inn, now I just write my password as fast as I possibly can and spam the enter button so I can log inn before that fucking scream.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i'm still amazed people play WoW with the sound on. It's horrid. Hey i own the soundtracks to the games via the collectors editions, doesn't mean i listen to them. I played through half the content in vanilla with the sound on. it's awful. dull and bleh. (apart from sylannas song which came with TBC collectors edition so i don't have to listen to it in game via blood elf quest or slash commands thank goodness)<br />
<br />
i play my own music, far better... far far far better, hell having the tv on behind me with sports or cartoons would be better. The constant &quot;ughhhh&quot; &quot;ooefoeffghhhh&quot; &quot;ooof&quot; &quot;argghhh&quot; of combat would have driven you crazy by now by playing hours and hours at a time, rather than a 2 second intro log in. Come on...</div></div><hr />

OH GOD NO, PLEASE NO!&quot; in my mind as soon as he mentioned that it needed more dragon. I facepalmed as Deathwing roared before the login bars even appeared. Looks like I'll have to figure out how to change the login sounds again, because I really can't take another two or three years of a dragon roaring in my face every single time I log in.<br />
<br />
Sindragosa appears to have been bugged for me somehow, because she would roar as soon as I got into the game client even if she hadn't even flown past yet. No dragon present, but a big freaking roar nonetheless every time. It's driven me mad frankly. I can't take more of that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Mute. Use it.<br />

2. Turn down your goddamn volume or take off your headphones if the noise is really THAT insufferable.<br />
<br />
3. You're probably autistic, or you can't handle any loud noises.<br />

4. You're an idiot that whines about everything.<br />

Seriously - the screech isn't loud, it's shorter than Sindy's, and the rest of the login screen looks just awesome. By far the best login screen yet.</div></div><hr />

be nice to have the option to change them, even implement your own background (which wouldn't be animated but it'd be yours). Even choices done by Blizzards artists (concept drawings), their wallpaper backgrounds or some of the fan made ones. <br />

Do you guys cry and bitch when dog's bark? Birds chirp? Frogs ribbet? Im just curious, and these are all serious questions that needs to be answered.<br />
<br />
They're more or less pissed because the first 2 login screens for Vanilla and BC, respectively, were simply a nice background with a kickass song.<br />
<br />
Wrath was that too, except for the fact there was FLAPFLAPFLAP RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHHH! And now it appears Cata will have a similar screech. The first 2 have shown that a login screen doesn't need to have a VERY nerve-grating noise to be cool. <br />
<br />
And what's the point of the roar? Vanilla had everything from dragons to demons to elementals, but the login screen didn't have any of those. BC was very demon-centered, but the login screen didn't have hundreds of demons chanting or something. Why Wrath had Sindragosa when she's only spoken of a handful of times in the entire expansion is beyond me. Arthas would have made more sense, and he wouldn't have roared (I hope).<br />
<br />
And for future reference, yes. I would get angry if my dog went something like &quot;SNIFF SNIFF SNIFF WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOF!&quot; very loudly every time I saw him.</div></div><hr />

Deathwing roars for like two seconds. From the video, it looks like it will take some time before he roars for two seconds. <br />
<br />
People love to focus on one tiny aspect of the login screen, and discount how fantastic the rest of it is visually. He's on top of effing Stormwind - I'd rather have that than some boring Dark Portal and two statues.</div></div><hr />

I'm still amazed why some people play with sound off, first to listen to the wonderful soundtrack blizz has made, its really rare to find a videogame with this epic soundtrack; second the sound helps you ALOT i mean ALOT LOT on your awareness with this you can &quot;see&quot; whats not in your screen and this is helpful on high end pve and pvp.<br />

Even discounting the horrid screeching Deathwing does, it's a little much to have his giant mug leering at you. Having a portal like we used to would be very nostalgic, especially considering this expansion is returning to its roots. I get why they decided to have Deathwing instead, but that screeching was a horrible idea. After all the pleasant feedback they got from Sindy's roaring (/sarcasm), I have to wonder what went through their minds when they put this in.<br />
<br />
A low rumble would be cool, backed up by crackling flames. Or barring that, him sitting there being menacing with said crackling flames would be even better.</div></div><hr />

^This. I LOVE the music in WoW. The fact that almost all of it is performed by actual people/instruments instead of a computer synthesizer is phenomenal considering just how much is in there, and the feeling really comes through. Regardless of how people felt about WotLK in general, the music receives almost universal praise. During the music panel the guy behind the Grizzly Hills music mentioned that it was his favorite piece and the audience broke out into spontaneous applause. It really evokes a lot of emotion and immerses you in the game.</div></div><hr />

It's very metallic, which suits the guy with a gigantic metal jaw. This is not your ordinary dragon, this is a fusion of creature and metal. Awesome.<br />
<br />
Perhaps it is because I don't frequent the forums, but I'm surprised that this many people dislike Sindragosa. It's a roaring undead ice dragon! Looks awesome, sounds awesome.<br />
<br />
For those of you who don't like the sound of Deathwing, it actually IS as simple as pressing a button on most modern computers. Click, wait a second, click again. Deathwing screech gone!<br />
<br />
And last, for you Hordies who object to Stormwind being on the login screen: remember that this is Stormwind in flames. Its inhabitants aren't exactly happy about the giant dragon perched on the gate...</div></div><hr />

(she's a guide/seeing eye dog, and theyre bred to be passive). <br />
I've played the video a few times since then, just to see, and its most definitley the screech that sets her off. I'm hoping this isnt the final 'roar' sound as I dont want to hear any stories about DW screeching making other dogs go nuts... Blizz need to take the pitch down a notch or two methinks.<br />
And yeah, i'll be loggin in with the volume down until its changed.<br />

Plus it looks retarded, the eyes are too big, makes it look like a whelping instead of a dragon. Not to mention the paws on the towers look retarded, they seem too obviously fixed and unable to move as being part of the towers themselves and not deathwing.<br />

Reading this 6 pages of comments, I can see 2 clans :<br />
- People who doesnt like the roar<br />
- People who suggest to &quot;turn down the volume&quot;.<br />
<br />
All in all, if no one enjoy it, why not expressing it ?<br />
<br />
Well, you see, a car doesnt have a button for TURNING DOWN THE VOLUME...<br />

God where do you people come from, you are why we cant have nice things. If they made a login screen that did nothing, you would complain about it being too boring.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you ever thought that this &quot;tiny aspect&quot; is the only thing wrong with the entire log in screen?<br />
<br />
Also to everyone that has to say, &quot;just turn down the sound,&quot; in actuality if they just had the epic music, didn't animate the roar/screaming girl noise, and had deathwing sitting on top of stormwind, would not only be a perfect login screen, but also less work to create it? Oh yea, and without 6 million (on a conservative estimate) people that would have to turn off/on their sound every time they long in for 2-3 years. Just a thought, but who am I really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ALSO! That Worgen cinematic was awesome, but there was something wrong with the dude's glasses. They shouldn't be white all the time. Glasses only light up like that when the light hits them a certain way, but when they're constantly lit like that it looks unnatural...I honestly thought the guy was a DK until the close up and I could see he was just wearing glasses. You'd think that the animation department for Blizzard would pay more attention to the little things...</div></div><hr />

I would gladly hear him do that metal dragon roar a million times before listening to Sindy's login once. The roar part of the wotlk login screen was only part of the annoying thing, there was also the whole &quot;flap flap land&quot; part.

I loved the login screen, but I'm still curious as to why they copy pasted the raptors from Jurassic Park into the sound files. I mean, metallish sound - check. Metal dragon thingy - check. But it sounds like teenage raptor crying for mommy. That being said. Nostalgia trips to Jurassic Park beats the shit out of Sindra.<br />
<br />
Epic screen tho.<br />

<br />
Time to go to mmowned.com when the time is there to put back that good old vanilla login screen.<br />
<br />
Why did blizzard went with this? Did they missed the memo of us hating that stupid Sindy flapping and especially roaring? Do they think we like to hear him roar for the next 2/3 years?<br />
<br />
Geez Blizzard!<br />
<br />
Yes, it looks awesome! No, it isn't a good login screen because it makes WoW start up slower and the roar will annoy every subscriber eventually. Blizzard, please change it! Or give us a option at the least!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AdamsGaming</div><div class="date">2010-10-24, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a LOGIN SCREEN people. Holy shit, stop complaining. You literally have to stare at it 30sec max every time you need to look at it.<br />
<br />
By the way, you are SUPPOSED to remember that screeching roar, because when you hear it in game you know shit will go down. I am pretty sure one of the key things about it is so we can recognize the unique sound of Deathwing's roar over all the other generic dragons of Azeroth. <br />
<br />
But, you know, if you don't care about the gameplay experience then you should probably go play something else. Possibly Tetris, oh wait the sounds there are &quot;annoying&quot; too.<br />
<br />
<br />
No, it isn't a good login screen because it makes WoW start up slower<br />
<br />
<br />
Um, no. It doesn't. It is a layered pre-rendered graphic specially optimized to your video settings. So no, your WoW starts up just as fast as mine no matter how hard Sindy or Deathwing roars.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They should add a disable sound box that actually quadruples the sound instead, and it takes them til next expansion to &quot;fix&quot; it... I would love to see how much you babies get your panties in a twist over that.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kuja</div><div class="date">2010-10-24, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wish there would be an option to change the login screen, or at least mute the background sounds in it.<br />
<br />
I think heavy login screen also slows the loading, because after WOTLK the login interface has appeared about 200% slower, especially if multitasking. I think it's the pretty WOTLK theme and Sindy flying around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But one thing bothers me.<br />
First off World of Warcraft needs more quality cinematics in telling there story like they did in warcraft 3 reign of chaos and frozen throne. Especially the endings. I have been waiting a loooooooong time to fight the lich king and his end was done terribly and Illidan's as well.<br />
<br />
Why couldnt they make the endings more climatic. Now the ingame cinematics are cool, but they dont involve your characters at all. We have no story involved in this game. <br />
<br />
As for the high quality cinematics we need more. Like introductions to each race leader, a battle they are fighting etc.<br />
<br />
I dont believe its expensive to pull off. Count the cinematics in warcraft 3 and how much they made off that game.<br />
<br />
Now look how much world of warcraft makes each month for 6 years. With there store and game combined. They owe us more story driven scenes.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Odexy</div><div class="date">2010-10-24, 09:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm surprised that almost everyone really likes it. I personally think it looks like shit. =/ Deathwing doesn't look badass at all, he kinda looks like he's grinning and it just looks way too cartoonish. Now, I realize WoW is a cartoonish game, but every other depiction of death wing thus far has been badass. Even Lil Deathy is cool. That log in screen just oozes cheese to me. <br />
<br />
Not even going to start with the roar, I shouldn't need to turn down my volume to log in. Especially because I LOVE listening to the music in WoW. Hell, even the music in the WotLK login sounds great if you ignore Sindragosa. <br />
<br />
But I guess we're stuck with it anyways.</div></div><hr />

So, no need to protect your account w/ an authenticator then?<br />

Besides the &quot;roar&quot;, the thing that probably upsets me the most, even more then the breaking-of-glass-sound, is the fact that I'm seeing the end boss on the login screen, for the next 2 years... And he's not even shaded, kind of bleak and misterious, like two red eyes popping from a cave and hearing a hiss or a mild growl, no, he's completely out there, exposed, screaming his lungs out. Way to go in obliterating any sense of tension, fear, mistery, horror, whatever you wanna call it.<br />
Plus, like I said before, DW looks like a whelp and not a full grown dragon. Just compare a freeze frame of the cinematic when DW lands in SW, and this login screen. It's poorly achieved.</div></div><hr />

and to the intro http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq4Y7ztznKc<br />
<br />
and then watch the login screen again.<br />
<br />
then that dragon on the cata login screen doesnt look like deathwing at all.. like maybe say maybe its a welp or smthing ?<br />
<br />
or just a another dragon.. w/e ;p but that deathwing on the login screen just has a way 2 different face, and 2 small to be deathwing..<br />
<br />
and that roarr.. lmao. so not deathwing imo.</div></div><hr />
