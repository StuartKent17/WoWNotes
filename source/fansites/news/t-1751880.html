Darkmoon Faire Races<br />
This month brings some more races to the Darkmoon Faire, in addition to the other Patch 6.1 changes (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4748-Darkmoon-Faire-Race-and-Changes-Archaeology-Fix-Blue-Tweets-Method-Interview-DLC). The first race uses the same course as last month, allowing you to earn Rocketeer: Gold (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/9764-rocketeer-gold) and the Everlasting Darkmoon Firework (http://www.wowdb.com/items/122119-everlasting-darkmoon-firework) fairly easily.<br />
<br />
The other two races use a new course that is more challenging. These reward Big Rocketeer: Gold (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/9805-big-rocketeer-gold) (Race MiniZep Controller (http://www.wowdb.com/items/122125-race-minizep-controller)) and Big Race Roadhog (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/9799-big-race-roadhog) (Checkered Flag (http://www.wowdb.com/items/122128-checkered-flag)). Keep in mind that the Checkered Flag (http://www.wowdb.com/items/122128-checkered-flag) only has 50 charges and that is the more difficult of the two achievements to complete. This can be done solo (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnuuNVr9K2U) if RNG lines up just right or with the help of a friend (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCQXSjxs4v4).<br />
<br />
The new course has new powerups as well. Everything other than the speed boots and coins rotates through the buffs, so they are constantly changing. There are two new buffs, one being a rocket that shoots you up in the air and the other being a small blue portal that rushes you ahead like Disengage. You can collect coins to power your final ability. There is also a new obstacle on this course, mini-zeppelins. These will shoot you and slow you down if you get too close to them.<br />

any plans to make the challenge mode gear from MoP account wide?<br />
No plans at this time. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/582657956115668992))<br />
<br />
hi guys, love your game. wondering why there is no heirloom mount that works for new Pandaren characters, is that intended?<br />
This is a side-effect of the chauffeured mount being affiliated w/ Alliance or Horde. Itâ€™ll work once you choose a faction. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/582660200751984640))<br />
<br />
with Heirlooms now going up to lvl 100, can we have them drop from Garrosh again? Main draw of those was look/90-100 scaling.<br />
Those were a reward for doing the content when it was relevant, and there are no plans to bring them back at this time. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/582660791792373760))<br />
<br />
Could the Polished Helm of Valor possibly get a change? Both it and the Might have Haste, which the Valor set is Crit-based.<br />
Thank you for the feedback. This and other Heirloom stat changes are being addressed in an upcoming patch. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/582662432574689280))<br />
<br />
Can the Follower Trait and Follower Ability Retraining items stack please? <br />
Items that don't have a high stack amount are our gentle way of encouraging their frequent use. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/582663609395728384))<br />

I did it on two classes back in MoP that I no longer find any fun to play, so I rerolled to my hunter and my mage for WoD. However, I never did the 9/9 CM gold back in MoP on them.

I already completed it twice on two classes, so why should I not earn the rewards on my mage and my hunter too? It somewhat restricts which characters you want to put time into (as all of the sets, in my opinion, look really really good) and having the set on character x and not on character y is very frustrating in hindsight despite class changes, rerolling to a new class etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can stand failing an achievement because I am bad at the game and messed up mechanics but being denied an achievement because I live in New Zealand not LA and am therefore further away from blizzard's servers really pisses me off. Also, that fucking tonk controller's inability to work properly. Pressing the button only to have it flat out refuse to shoot, even if the target is right in front of me blows chunks.</div></div><hr />

It actually has very little to do with RNG. Frequently you'll be close to hitting the shortcut spot when the item is one turn from rotating to the rocket... and if you're not you're not going to make it anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah I'm kind of of the opinion that it should stay character specific. I did Endless Damage 30 on my retribution Paladin in MoP which was rock hard and I'm very pleased with the fact that I did, but I can equip the title you get from it on a freshly rolled alt, which I have no right to do so, and the achievement bears no character specifics, so there's no proof I didn't just cheese it on a DK.<br />
<br />
Can't do it anymore, and some classes had it considerably easier than others in Proving Grounds or Challenge modes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fact is, you didn't earn it on those characters. I did challenge modes on every class except Priest. Would I like that xmog set? Sure! But I didn't prove that I could get 9/9 Gold with a priest, so I'm content without. <br />
<br />
Now, what I would be okay with is unlocking the xmog for any class you earned it on, so that if you made an alt of the same class, they could use it. But if you didn't complete it with the class in question, you don't deserve it imho.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ring toss achievment is pretty simple once you figure it out. I did it buy placing the recticle on the ground where the turtle stops in the middle of the pen. It always moves to the outside of the pen in a straight line. When it stops, turns around, and starts moving back to the middle I started casting the throw. 10 rings easy. It also helped to zoom the camera all the way in to first person, especially if there are other people working on the daily at the same time as you are doing it. :cool:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um, that's not anywhere near what people are asking for. They want account wide cm gear that YOU UNLOCKED. Which means if you did 9/9 on a pally but stopped playing him and made a new pally on another server you should be allowed to have your cm gear on the new pally. Not a fucking mage you didn't earn it on. People have no concept of reality.</div></div><hr />

I did challenge modes on every class except Priest. Would I like that xmog set? Sure! But I didn't prove that I could get 9/9 Gold with a priest, so I'm content without. <br />
<br />
Now, what I would be okay with is unlocking the xmog for any class you earned it on, so that if you made an alt of the same class, they could use it. But if you didn't complete it with the class in question, you don't deserve it imho.<br />
<br />
Meh, I don't get why you think you don't deserve it on that character. You already completed it on 9 other classes. It can't be that hard to do it on a priest as well then? WoW should continue moving towards account wide progression rather than character progression. The game has been out over 10 years. The majority has leveled up and stuck with more than one single character throughout their playtime. <br />
<br />
I'm glad to see mounts, pets and achievements have been made account wide. And I also think challenge mode rewards should be account wide too. If you have to prove yourself on that class to earn the reward, then bake it into the WoD CMs, so that when you do 8/8 WoD gold CMs, you also earn the 9/9 gold CM reward from MoP if you have Challenge Conqueror: Gold on your account, but not on that character.</div></div><hr />

Good for you. You now know what the opportunity cost is for storing many of them. Make bank alts for other stuff if it means that much to you.<br />
<br />
Or the geniuses over at blizz HQ could not make choices that tax bag space more. No reason to force players to use an item before they want to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because completing 9/9 Gold on a priest is not the same as doing 9/9 Gold on a monk or warrior. Knowing the ends and outs of that classes abilities and how to use them effectively was paramount to success. <br />
<br />
Now obviously at the end you could have been carried to 9/9 or even paid for it, which then makes my opinion moot. But to that end, I'd say that as someone who did all of mine legitimately, I really wouldn't want to see others rewarded with the other xmog sets. <br />
<br />
The fact is, this was a limited time offer. Shoot, I'd only done it on 5 toons/ classes two weeks before they were removed. I knocked out 6 more toons/ 5 classes those last two weeks to ensure I had the xmogs.<br />
<br />
What you are suggesting, would make all the time I invested be wasted. I had 9/9 Gold on my first toon right as ToT released. That's countless hours that I spent that would become meaningless by your proposal.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying it won't happen, as Blizzard makes gear worthless after every new major patch release, thus making those hours seem wasted as well technically, but personally, in this instance, I'd rather they not.</div></div><hr />

It's actually a lot like Blink. It won't shoot you off ledges, and you won't impact anything you are accelerated through.<br />

(Disengage is also backwards).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Assuming the price keeps going up and doesn't settle out or rise by less than 1%, we can see the price to be:<br />
<br />
After 24 hours: 38,092<br />
After 48 hours: 48366<br />
After 72 hours: 61411<br />
<br />
I'd think it would probably settle out by that time, or maybe keep going. There might be updates where the price doesn't go up at all, or up by a fraction of a percent, but it stands to reason that people have a lot of spare gold to spend, and there's a lot waiting for the price to rise sot hey can get the maximum gold out of it.</div></div><hr />
