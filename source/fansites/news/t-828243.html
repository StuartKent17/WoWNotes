Now that Cataclysm is out in the wild, more players are getting gearing up and checking out Tol Barad, the new outdoor PvP zone. Today, we wanted to address some of the concerns players have expressed about the zone, including how challenging it can be to win as the attacking team, and provide some insight into our design approach. We also wanted to share some of the lessons we learned from Wintergrasp, discuss the difference between the two zones, and touch upon the recent hotfixes made to Honor Point gains and how we plan to improve Tol Barad going forward. We're confident this zone will provide meaningful and fun PvP for some time to come, but we also recognize additional tuning is required to ensure Tol Barad is everything we intend it to be.<br />
<br />
As we mentioned earlier, the attacking faction is having a pretty tough time winning control of Tol Barad -- and we're OK with that, at least in theory. Here's why: When we set out to create Wintergrasp, one of the issues we dealt with was that we were never able to ensure the sides were even -- in fact, they rarely were. Because the smaller team would almost always be assured defeat, we attempted to address team-size imbalance by favoring the attacker. Control of Wintergrasp went back and forth, and the result was that battles lost their impact. On most realms the defenders became complacent, knowing they were likely to lose control of the zone, returning to re-take it when it was their turn to attack. The sides swapped back and forth every few hours, and Wintergrasp wasn’t so much about an epic struggle for a meaningful piece of land as it was a complicated game of leapfrog.<br />
<br />
Since then we’ve devised mechanics that help ensure equal team sizes, and we've taken Wintergrasp's lessons to heart when we designed Tol Barad. Tol Barad is intentionally balanced so that it’s a challenge for the attackers, because we want to make sure that control of Tol Barad matters. For the defenders, there’s a sense of urgency that Wintergrasp didn't have -- if you lose it, you’re going to have a hell of a time taking it back. For the attackers, there are a number of rewards at stake -- such as access to the Baradin Hold raid and additional daily quests -- that we hope players feel are worth fighting for. That sort of tension is what we wanted from Wintergrasp, and what we believe Tol Barad can ultimately offer.<br />
<br />
With that being said, we want winning Tol Barad to be a challenge for the attacking faction... but we don't want it to be impossible. Taking Tol Barad should be tough -- but right now it’s a little bit too tough, and it’s something we’re actively working to balance. Earlier, we attempted to temporarily address the issue by offering a far better reward to the winning attackers: Honor Points awarded for successfully attacking were increased tenfold, but that was such a great incentive that it ultimately undermined the spirit of competition. Since then, the reward for winning as an attacker has been brought back down to a more reasonable amount.<br />
<br />
While we've already made minor adjustments to improve the gameplay and address select exploits, our job in Tol Barad is far from over. We ultimately want to make sure that any changes we make are all steps in the right direction, and we intend to make several updates in the next minor patch to address design and balance issues affecting attackers that we can't address with hotfixes. For example, we plan to alter the battle slightly so that a team with two bases captured can more quickly and easily capture the third, as opposed to a team with one or zero bases. This way, if the defenders turtle up, it'll be a little easier for the attackers to take their last base before the defense can take one of the attackers' other bases.<br />
<br />
We've been reading your feedback, watching trends across our global realms, and fighting plenty of battles in Tol Barad ourselves to get a feel for what's working and what isn't, and we're committed to making Tol Barad a fun and engaging zone. We want owning the zone to be meaningful throughout the lifespan of the expansion -- and while the attackers may always face somewhat of an uphill battle, the defenders should feel much more pressure not to lose than they do currently. Just the same, the attacking faction should feel motivated to take Tol Barad back, but they shouldn't feel that the odds are insurmountable. So keep fighting the good fight, and we'll continue watching the battlefield and listening to your feedback.<br />

<br />
If they had to chose between &quot;constantly changing hands&quot; and &quot;never changing hands&quot;, the former is absolutely better, and everyone ultimately benefits from it.<br />
<br />
And Wintergrasp was meaningful to everyone especially with the high turnover rate of possession ... until they made the quests there Weekly-resetting quests instead of Dailies.<br />
<br />
And I guarantee if someone goes and digs up the blue post explanation for when they nerfed the WG Daily quests and compares it to this new blue post they'll get a real good laugh.<br />
<br />
Nevermind the myriad of other reasons why Wintergrasp didn't have as much 'meaning' as Tol Barad would right now... most obvious being that Wintergrasp only offered rewards that pertained to PvP (read: PvP trinkets/resilience gear), whereas Tol Barad's rewards are novelty and PvE rewards, and right now PvE epic gear is scarce and more difficult to come by compared to WotLK.</div></div><hr />

Minimum rez timer duration of 10 seconds, none of this AB can't take Stables cause the rez timer is faster than it takes to click the flag. It's a PVP zone, if you die, it should matter. Also, 33 second rez timers suck, you die, go to GY, the rez pops, but you missed it by .5 seconds so the 30 second timer pops up for you, so in essence you have a 33-34 second rez timer, fail.<br />
<br />
The convenient center rez point for D problem is compounded when you have 10-15 D get a 2 second rez timer. Again Blizz, w/ the RNG. It's 2 seconds or 34 seconds.<br />
<br />
Make everyone have a mandatory FIXED rez timer of 20 seconds.(or some other FIXED duration based on travel time from objective to objective VS the rate of capping a base) This way, it encourages you not to die and to actually get PVP GEAR, (God Forbid)</div></div><hr />

Yeah, sure, fewer defenders, but that was only because the rewards were worse for defense. <br />
<br />
Simple solution: make it easy for attackers to win, but defense gets given a few extra quests (like one for 10 honor kills, one for helping to cap each base, etc). There, fixed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then, you sir, have a battlegroup who knows how to fight war...<br />
<br />
Tol Barad is a test to see which faction can tactically use the men and women given in the PvP queue system to collectively come together and complete an objective. It's almost RTS in that nature, without the point-and-click type control over 'units'... and it also rewards the most coordinated, and leader-worthy.<br />
<br />
With that being said, Blizzard is ignoring the fact that many players don't care about the battle, or the concept of honor and faction loyalty. They just want to win... the game is not about the story to them, just winning. It's this sad lack of immersion that I think makes TB a failfest, because people who don't listen (or care enough to listen), and just going to ignore strategy and end up gimping the faction they are on...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except it's a pvp zone... <br />
<br />
Personally, I believe the raid boss in a pvp zone should give conquest points and ONLY pvp gear.. nothing to benefit PvE. This keeps it from being balanced SOLELY around the fact that non-so-bright pve'ers want their pve benefit without having to pvp.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">[-Spiritus-]</div><div class="date">2011-01-10, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The simple fix here is whoever holds 2 of 3 at the end of the timer wins. Defenders have the advantage because they spawn in the middle. If the attackers capture all 3, or hold 2 of 3, they win. If defenders hold 2 of 3, they win.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SirLancelittle</div><div class="date">2011-01-10, 06:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting post. I had always taken it as obvious that it was better to alternate control (for dailies) than it was to allow the defender to keep control. Blizzard does make a good argument here that the battles are more important if this isn't the case. <br />
<br />
However, I still think it needs to be much closer to 50/50. As it stands the defender wins so often that the battle still doesn't feel important because the outcome feels already decided. Furthermore, I still feel that it seems unfair/unbalanced for PvErs to be affected by the outcome of PvP.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Noah37</div><div class="date">2011-01-10, 06:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea truthfully it should favor the attacker so that both teams can enjoy the zone. When the defenders win 2/3 time it makes the other team completely lose interest, it is severly imbalanced on servers like mine where only 10-15 Alliance will join the battle, it's fairly impossible to cap and hold 4 bases with groups of 2.</div></div><hr />

Yes, the attacking side loses 90% of the time, but they get really close throughout the battle. I think people are seeing the 90% loss rate and saying TB is terrible. I´ve been attacking enough times where we had 2 nodes and were within 30 seconds of winning to know that it will not take much of a change to make it work.<br />
<br />
The other thing.. once they do tweek things to let that last node cap faster, then the turtling will stop as a defensive tactic (since it will no longer be effective).<br />
<br />
That said, I still really don´t like TB as a world pvp battle, it feels too much like a mini-game. I like WG where you actually ´defended´the fort. In TB, you aren´t really defending.. because you can lose stuff, gain it back, lose it again, gain it back.. etc.</div></div><hr />

right now on Arthas alliance basically control the fight via how many people queue. When you can queue as a guild or raid group on vent with 100% of your players having a guaranteed spot vs a horde guild or raid group that has maybe a 30% chance of getting in makes the battle arguably unfair to begin with. Much like a pre-maid is generally guaranteed a victory, which normally is acceptable, but IMO not in a &quot;world pvp&quot; environment such as TB. In such a dynamic fight this heavily pushes win chances to the team that is more organized. <br />
On the whole TB has the feel of a very unfinished pvp environment in terms of mechanics, mechanics that make it impossible to win against an organized defense. which makes the battle more or less of a frustrating tug-of-war, or keep away than an actual battle.</div></div><hr />

/facepalm<br />
The more organized team is more likely to win?! What a complete disaster! <br />
You know the solution, though. Its the same as what caused this to start with on many servers - faction transfers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's what most of these people don't want. They got so spoiled winning every single WG off numbers alone that they want TB to be the same. They don't like an equal battlefield, and they really don't like it when the otherside gets a fair fight.<br />
<br />
Want to fix TB make it a deathmatch. Each team starts out with 0 points, first team to 500 points wins. You gain 2 points per kill. Killing a tower grants you 75 points, killing a siege awards you 25. <br />
<br />
Now the defenders HAVE to go out and actually fight. The attackers have to engage the enemies. It feels more like an actual war. Taking a tower can be a nice boost, but if you lose a few siege while doing it your team suffers so you better have defenders. <br />
<br />
Personally I think it's fine. When our side has lost it we've never had trouble taking it right back. <br />

<br />
<br />
1) Let us fly after the battle is over like during Wintergrasp so we can not be hindered doing the dailies. You didn't re-make all of Azeroth and allow flying to prevent flying in the new zones. It's a silly backward step. <br />
2) Balance Tol'Barad instead of coming up with a big speech telling us how you're going to fix it. Don't tell us, just fix it. We will be happy and rejoice.<br />
3) Make it an even and fair opportunity for both sides to win. That is why you introduced the player cap after all, right? The whole reason the place is unbalanced is because of your stupid design philosophy of balance towards the defending side. Make it even, that is the whole point of balance.</div></div><hr />

all those guys with their stupid &quot;good ol´days&quot; xD I personally would love it when you could use your flying mount outside the battle, i mean why can´t they make an debuff like in wg when the battle starts which dismounts you? well</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're welcome to sit out the battle and let the PVPers cap TB and then come in and do their PVE stuff - heck thats what I've been doing ever since I finished grinding my (PVE benefit) trinket.<br />
<br />
I think what you'll see is that a lot of people will get the gear they can, and then stop playing TB. When I get my 2 tier pieces done, chances are I wont set foot in TB again until the next tier is released.</div></div><hr />

We (Alliance) never get Tol Barad and even if it would be a little bit more easy we still would have no way wining it with PVE gear against full-gladiator Horde. I really would prefer the Wintergrasp style that leads to faction change every 2 hours because defending is nearly impossible. That way everyone can do the dailys and kill the PVP raidboss. The worst thing that happes that you have to wait 2 hours. You can't force a whole faction of a server to become good PVP players.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">carneymaster11</div><div class="date">2011-01-10, 07:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How do the attackers win TB? Do they have to control all 3 nodes for the allotted time? Or do the attackers win upon gaining all 3 nodes instantly? I know the defenders win by merely turtling one base after another. With sides being even the attackers cant attack all 3 spots and hold them from the attackers getting them back. say its 30-30, as you move from one base to another attacking you leave behind defenders so the other team doesnt come in and take it. but the defenders can put 100% of their forces into one base while the attackers mathematically split up 33% to each base. 30 vrs 10 who wins? if they made it that majority wins, I.E, 2/3 bases for allotted time that would work in either sides favor. Neither side could turtle one base cause you would have to hold 2 at the least. the attackers could indeed send sufficient forces to deal with one of the other teams 2 bases and possibly take it. the dying defenders only have to rez and go back to what they were defending or go take another base. <br />
<br />
As well i think it would be interesting if destroying the towers did other things than give the attacking team more time. say instead the south tower gives 5 more min. but the north west tower takes away 5 min. and whoever destroys the north east tower gets a buff. all 3 towers would be attackable by both sides. but after the part where i was talking about majority i started rambling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm all FOR the keeping/making attacking hard, and providing everyone an incentive to work hard to WIN. Not making the outcome of the battle a foregone conclusion all the time.<br />
<br />
I don't want TB to turn into WG where every battle it WILL change hands if the attackers are at least partially non-retarded.<br />
I love it that once you have TB atm you do EVERYTHING possible to keep it, and it's actually possible to do so.<br />
I don't like that attacking is such an uphill battle atm, but hopefully they're proposed change will alleviate this.</div></div><hr />

On my server, it switches every 3-4 battles, great for doing the dailies and not losing it already is a challenge, despite it being a PvE realm both factions really know what they're doing..<br />
<br />
Right after we all started hitting 85, the Alliance had TB 95% of the time, if not more. But now that it's changed hands a few times and we Hordies have more experience taking it and holding it, it changes hands at least once a day.<br />
<br />
And it's fun and intense, too -- no matter whether you are attacking or defending. Yeah, it's just a clusterfrak mated with a circle jerk zerg, but when it gets down to the wire the team that can communicate and move better will win - and that makes it a lot better than WG at its imbalanced worst.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tol Barad is a test to see which faction can tactically use the men and women given in the PvP queue system to collectively come together and complete an objective. It's almost RTS in that nature, without the point-and-click type control over 'units'... and it also rewards the most coordinated, and leader-worthy.<br />
<br />
If by that you mean &quot;create a giant defensive zerg at one base, then graveyard zerg another base when you finally die&quot;, then yes, that is what Blizzard did. There's nothing tactical or RTS like about Tol Barad at all. It's fundamentally a bad design.<br />
<br />
That they are apparently deliberately trying to slant things in favor of defense over the superior Wintergrasp model is pretty baffling, but then Blizzard almost never gets PvP right. (Wintergrasp itself being one of the few times they did.)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thallidomaniac</div><div class="date">2011-01-10, 07:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">none of the alleged design changes touches on the balance on unequal pop servers.<br />
right now on Arthas alliance basically control the fight via how many people queue. When you can queue as a guild or raid group on vent with 100% of your players having a guaranteed spot vs a horde guild or raid group that has maybe a 30% chance of getting in makes the battle arguably unfair to begin with. Much like a pre-maid is generally guaranteed a victory, which normally is acceptable, but IMO not in a &quot;world pvp&quot; environment such as TB. In such a dynamic fight this heavily pushes win chances to the team that is more organized. <br />
On the whole TB has the feel of a very unfinished pvp environment in terms of mechanics, mechanics that make it impossible to win against an organized defense. which makes the battle more or less of a frustrating tug-of-war, or keep away than an actual battle.<br />
<br />
Well if they didn't implement the enforced 1:1 ratio rule, the outnumbering faction would almost always win due to how the speed of bases capped is determined by the number of people in the area, not to mention Tenacity didn't do a whole lot in WG.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arkstone</div><div class="date">2011-01-10, 07:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I think that Blizzard approach is very wrong for TB. IMHO it is much better, when controll of TB switches back and forth, instead of when one side practically controlling it permanently. Fun of this battle is not about WHO controlling it, fun should be in the battle itself. It seems that they've forgotten about that simple fact and trying to think outside of the box, but neverthless it's not worth it to make battle harder for one side. I agree that balance is very good in case of how much players on both sides, but requirements for win must be balanced for both sides as well, otherwise it is VERY unfair fight.</div></div><hr />

There is a big difference between an uphill battle and straight up bullshit advantages, something I figured they'd have noticed in the terrible design of something so simple as &quot;Hold 3 places at the same time to win&quot; with never the thought that, in even numbers, a team defensively zerging in one spot, and sending a few to capture the other two while the attackers have to throw everything they have at that one spot, is in every sense a failed design and in that regard Wintergrasp was better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just hit 85 this weekend and decided to check out Tol Barad to see what the fuss was about. That place is horrid. It's just Arathi Basin but with far more players, and by holding 1 single base you win if you're defending. We would capture 2 bases, then the Horde would turtle. The game ends with the defended winning, and then someone says we hadn't had won TB since the Tuesday before, for 2 hours. I'm not joining another TB until it's changed.<br />
<br />
So Blizzard, you didn't like how people would stop defending in WG, now you've got people that don't even want to attack in TB.</div></div><hr />

It had its problems, sure, but it was a rather novel concept and felt a heck of a lot more epic than TB does. I'd be happy, and I'm sure others would as well, if they made a non-snowy copy of Wintergrasp, perhaps with a few layout changes, make the quests dailies instead of weeklies again, and make the teams even as they are in TB. No more tenacity, but you still have epic fights that aren't just big runarounds. The attacking team has a clear objective, and can make progress toward that without the worry of backtracking the rest of the fight.</div></div><hr />

They just spew meaningless PR bullshit when there are huge problems. They never directly address these problems or even outright acknowledge them. Its always &quot;there MAY be an issue&quot; or &quot;we'll keep an eye on it&quot; when its painfully obvious to everyone who plays (and pays for) this game that there IS a problem and it needs to be fixed, not observed. If this is the type of crap they want to send out, I would prefer nothing. Then at least I wouldn't have to waste my time reading it only to realize that it had no actual substance.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure he's referring to the fact that WG was not 1:1 balanced for 95% of WOTLK, meaning that on a server that has 9:1 horde, the horde would almost always win. With TB, and the 1:1 enforcement, it's not a foregone conclusion simply because of the number of players on the respective teams.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here is the ONLY thing they need to change. Seriously it would keep it competitive without changing the way the game is played. <br />
<br />
Just increase the size of the &quot;cap&quot; part of the bases status bars. That way it takes longer to uncap a base giving the attackers more time to get all three.</div></div><hr />

You know the solution, though. Its the same as what caused this to start with on many servers - faction transfers.<br />

dip$hit faction transfers is not a fix for imbalance. way to miss read/quote to my argument which is servers with less pop factions have MORE control over getting them organized teams.<br />

Absolute garbage in my eyes, this is just a bunch of lawyer press release garbage.<br />
40 cap? We've had two full raids on each side before. And Skywall is, by far, not the largest server out in the pool. There's something like a 100 player cap for each side. <br />
<br />
Tol Barad works just fine. Sure, for a while, it was difficult to wrestle control back. But once all the morons who can't figure out how to CC or kill the healers left the place (typically the same rejects who don't understand how to move out of the fire) got tired of losing and stopped queuing, we've been seeing the place swap back and forth rather consistently. If they play to make the place easier, yay? Not going to complain if they do, but the only places that need it are the ones with a complete group of morons for one faction. And even then, I doubt the fix they plan will do anything for the servers that still can't win the zone back -now-.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Defenders split into two groups. One group retakes whatever location the other faction recently claimed as they get destroyed at their old location.<br />
The Horde and Alliance switch bases effectively. Defense stays ahead by 2 to 1 and they almost always win this way. I've told the bg leaders before they were idiots to suggest we just fall back and defend the last tower for 10 minutes. You can and will lose that way.</div></div><hr />

More to the point, it should be easier on attackers so that the losing side doesn't just get frustrated and quit.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">turlockmike</div><div class="date">2011-01-10, 07:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing I loved about WG was the destructible buildings, siege vehicles, etc. Without those things it becomes really boring quickly. The towers are pointless and the game quickly devolves into a race to trade. Also with the increased health pools, the disadvantage of having pve gear has mostly evaporated meaning it's really really balanced and boring. The goal should be a 50/50 chance of winning depending on strategy and players involved. Right now we win about 1/20 tol barads while on offense and only lose like 1/20 while on defense (mostly due to retards fighting on the road). <br />
<br />
The whole thing needs to be redesigned to make it more fun and more interesting, otherwise, once everyone is exalted with the faction, there will simply be no incentive to go there. Adding cannons to the bases and moving the attackers graveyard would go a long way to improve it. It would be interesting if the attackers graveyard was directly underneath the center.</div></div><hr />

Back on WG someone said that the buff that made the players mini-raid-bosses was enough to fight a unfair amount of other faction players, IF that included a CC-immunity for X seconds after being released from a CC. And really, THAT was the lack of balance. They could face 7 players of the other faction with the buffs to attack, HP and defense, BUT the fact there was 7 CC working on chain on the character, made it unfair.<br />
So WG problem was not about the numbers on each side. They did a pretty good job there. It was about ALLOWING the smaller side to act. So, the addressing with the problem in WG is wrong.<br />
And that might have set the direction on TB wrong too.</div></div><hr />

There are PvP and RPPvP realms where mounted status matter a lot more than just &quot;i cant get to my mob fast, avoid other mobs&quot;. This is not going to happen.<br />

yes organization is key, but the bias remains regardless. now go fly a kite, or catch bugs on your tongue or something<br />
<br />
Love it when baddie pvers get their panties in a wad because they feel entitled to something. Wake up, this isn't wrath anymore. All of you players that feel like you are entitled to run a raid should get over it. If you want it, learn to pvp and come take it. <br />
<br />
I'm really glad they are keeping it hard. My faction already takes it back with ease, it will just make it even easier to take it back once they change things. We will always hold it then, to hell with the alliance ever getting it. They don't deserve it, they can't pvp so they don't get rewards.

Reminds me of a larger scale Arathi Basin, I keep trying to enjoy pvp but its so f'ed up right now.. ugh i miss the old pvp days of battle through the ranks doing world pvp and bgs.

<br />
Tol Barad is a test to see which faction can tactically use the men and women given in the PvP queue system to collectively come together and complete an objective. It's almost RTS in that nature, without the point-and-click type control over 'units'... and it also rewards the most coordinated, and leader-worthy.<br />
<br />
With that being said, Blizzard is ignoring the fact that many players don't care about the battle, or the concept of honor and faction loyalty. They just want to win... the game is not about the story to them, just winning. It's this sad lack of immersion that I think makes TB a failfest, because people who don't listen (or care enough to listen), and just going to ignore strategy and end up gimping the faction they are on...<br />
<br />
Yes, because 40 people at one point on defense is &quot;tactics&quot;. It'd be like the United States putting every singe military asset in South Dakota, and having all 49 other states over run by whoever, and then saying &quot;Hey wait, we still have South Dakota. You lose. GTFO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they'd remove Mr. Free T11 hands and pants from Tol Barad then it'd stop a lot of whining about the PvP. Then change it to where which ever faction controls Tol Barad gets a 10% honor boost in all bgs or keep Baradin Hold and have him only drop PvP purples.<br />
<br />
They need to decouple PvE and PvP in Tol Barad. Do you see PvP'ers going to PvE raids to get PvP gear?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem is that the win conditions are fundamentally flawed. Either they can change the condition, making it much more balanced and fun (say two out of three at the end of the time, take out the towers) or they can keep sticking on bandaids that will break/unbalancing some other part in endless tweaking fixing/breaking things, sort of like the rogue class.</div></div><hr />

2) Balance Tol'Barad instead of coming up with a big speech telling us how you're going to fix it. Don't tell us, just fix it. We will be happy and rejoice.<br />
3) Make it an even and fair opportunity for both sides to win. That is why you introduced the player cap after all, right? The whole reason the place is unbalanced is because of your stupid design philosophy of balance towards the defending side. Make it even, that is the whole point of balance.<br />

To fix what was happing in wg u made the q to get in 1 for 1 which sounds fair on an unbalenced server but really is not. The side with the lower population aka alliance can literally que up with a full guild or premade team while the other side aka horde is lucky too even get one of their guildmatets in TB to begin with. Since TB came out i have got que to it maybe 3 times total of queing about 20. And the only time i got the que was at a low popular our like 6 am. I don't know how you can make this a fun zone at all if the majoriy of the server can't even play it. Just make it a bg and take out the world pvp part imo. But as long as one faction dominates the other in population per server, it will never be balenced. sorry to burst your bubble blizz.<br />
<br />
And lastly plz make bgs award more honor. Being horde and haveing 10-20 min bg ques to win about 200 honor IF we win is really not cool. Thank you.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rawktoo</div><div class="date">2011-01-10, 08:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So because WG switched sides occasionally they didn't like it? Uhh yeah ok....<br />
<br />
I just hit 85 this weekend and decided to check out Tol Barad to see what the fuss was about. That place is horrid. It's just Arathi Basin but with far more players, and by holding 1 single base you win if you're defending. We would capture 2 bases, then the Horde would turtle. The game ends with the defended winning, and then someone says we hadn't had won TB since the Tuesday before, for 2 hours. I'm not joining another TB until it's changed.<br />
<br />
So Blizzard, you didn't like how people would stop defending in WG, now you've got people that don't even want to attack in TB.<br />
<br />
... Did you even read the blue? That's exactly the situation they are changing with this patch. In your scenario the horde wouldn't be able to turtle come patch time.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jd5</div><div class="date">2011-01-10, 08:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are 2 issues with Tol Barad that need to get fixed.<br />
<br />
1 - Stop with the attack / defend crap Blizz, you have not been able to ever figure on how to balance it (and cannot because it is based on more then game mechanics... people, skill, stradegy, etc. all are factors you cannot balance with a sliding scale).<br />
<br />
Tol Barad should be attack / attack. Give both sides a goal, and that would be control of the most nodes after time or control of 3 nodes (auto-win). The winner then holds the right to all the goodies the former &quot;defender&quot; would have until the next battle when both sides need to try capture it again. This forces everyone to fight for their supper.<br />
<br />
2 - Balance. I wish I had an answer here, but this is all Blizz's fault. They (and they alone) created the problem allowing people to x-fer on unbalanced servers. The simple answer (from a non-business standpoint) is for them to track the numbers (login's per side, which side is waiting in queue's for Tol Barad, etc.) and allow for free x-fer's (if the lesser side meets a certain ratio) until they balance out and then turn them off. After that only allow people to faction swap on the same server if both sides are within an acceptable (active) ratio. Again this makes sense from a player standpoint, not so much from a business one.<br />
<br />
At the minimum I hope they realize enough to know it is a factor. They went from the larger (pop) side having all the benefits to the lesser (pop) side now having them, instead of trying to balance it in the middle like Blizzard should have. And yes the lesser side is now in charge seeing as they can better queue up skilled groups instead of the larger sides random pugs. They also got the benefit from all the win trading as they were able to queue for every win match they wanted to as opposed to the large side that still only stood a chance based on the amount of people queuing. I see several players on my server on the lesser side with full bloody gear that should have taken 2-3x the amount of time to get.<br />
<br />
Much like a lot of other people, I'd like them to stop telling us they think there *may* be a problem and fix the actual one's that everyone already know exist.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">slosh</div><div class="date">2011-01-10, 08:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just make it so for each tower you take out the attacking team has an easier time taking a base.<br />
<br />
So if normally the defender has the base at 80 and attacker has it at 20, make it so each tower has the base at 5 more.<br />
<br />
So it'd be:<br />
<br />
No towers: 20<br />
1 tower: 25<br />
2 towers: 30<br />
3 towers: 35<br />
<br />
<br />
That'll solve the problem where the attacking team has two bases and is just a few seconds away from getting the third when the defenders grab another base. It will be harder for the defenders to take back that base as they now have 15 more &quot;points&quot; to take back, and it'll be easier on the attackers because they have 15 fewer points to take.<br />
<br />
Basically turns into a swing of 10 &quot;points&quot; per tower, which I think would balance things out and give the attackers an easier time of winning. It'll also force teams to start defending both towers and bases.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is the intense daily zone with massive overfarming and zerglike respawn rates.<br />
<br />
I am not saying that I enjoy Tol Barad dailies, but the zones are designed to give you some grief as you ride from questing spot to questing spot. I don't see them ever allow flying there because they put so much effort in to designing the areas to attract adds as you try to ride around the place.</div></div><hr />

Tol Barad is a complete joke compared to Wintergrasp in pretty much every way. It would take a complete revamp to bring it up to par, which they're not gonna do.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShammyHaygar</div><div class="date">2011-01-10, 09:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">or example, we plan to alter the battle slightly so that a team with two bases captured can more quickly and easily capture the third, as opposed to a team with one or zero bases. This way, if the defenders turtle up, it'll be a little easier for the attackers to take their last base before the defense can take one of the attackers' other bases<br />
<br />
this will ultimately end up having defense Nerfed to the point where offense will ALWAYS win. Right now the attackers fail due to them not working together you see 1/3 of the group got IG then the rest are fighting on towers , and this is giving offense time to recap in a round the ring type of fashion. to win takes timing , teamwork and the will to live. <br />
<br />
if we just make it so they do not have to work for the third zone might as well make it a 2 zone BG</div></div><hr />

On servers where one faction greatly outnumbers the other, players on both sides get screwed. Even if every 85 queues up for Tol Barad on one faction and the ratio of one faction to the other is greater then 2:1, the rest of the players on the faction with larger numbers won't be able to get in for victories. It's so broken as a whole it's retarded and honestly I dislike the way the whole thing is designed. Wintergrasp was far more fun overall, regardless of what anyone says.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They aren't. The winning side (from my reading at least) almost always seems to be the lesser pop side. Once all things are equal (to a point - if they'd follow my #1 issue also) people will tend to flock back to the side they prefer to play (many faction swappers did so in WotLK because of WG - not that it's the only factor, but it tipped the scales and once the gap was too big the rest flooded over IMO). They would also switch to improve their chances at getting into Tol Barad (assuming PVP is a factor for them), so long as one side has less people queuing (and is still under the cap) it holds the benefit of auto-queues.<br />
<br />
If you mean winning zerg side as in the larger pop side overall (in general)... does it really matter? Save for the little world PVP left what does being on the large pop side give you???<br />
<br />
The other big factor in changing sides (back to the lesser pop side) is alts. If moves were free I'd be willing to bet there would be more then enough people willing to give the other side a try (either for the first time or to go back) if they could bring over all their characters instead of forking over $25/per.</div></div><hr />

I would love to see more options than just run and try to take the next base such as if you achieve this goal you gain mount speed buffs so you can attack faster or if the defenders achieve this goal they unleash a horde of mobs from the center that attacks the opposite faction.<br />
There are a number of really amazing oppurtunities to make tol barad an expirience that will drive players to &quot;want&quot; not need to be there when it starts. I have always thought that the tanks should be able to attack the bases as well as the towers. Why not have the tanks be able to free fire or auto attack so that they can shoot rockets from a distance at the flag spot of bases forcing the opposite faction to come out of the base to attack it. I just dont want to see some stupid buff to tol barad like happened with wintergrasp, dont make it about numbers make it about strategy, you did it with heroics now do it with pvp.</div></div><hr />

Tol barad is fail and everyone knows it. Maybe Blizz has some ideas but with they temps of fixing next year maybe we will have some advance. If there is some better choosing of players for the battle , for example to check arena or rated battlegrounds rating and the players with higher rating to be chosen than ppl who never play arena's or bg's (like me) and have no idea how to use their abilities in PvP situation. Also as were said reducing the time to capture the third base with 1/3 of the normal time if attackers are holding other two bases is what I consider better than this situation. Tbh I never think for improvements of Tol Barad and i slightly care because I'm not pvp oriented player but still even for me it's a fail. <br />
Gl to all attackers and don't loose hope in blizz.</div></div><hr />

This will be the biggest fail. Can you imagine rogue who is stealted but can be seen on the minimap? This is stupid. I hate rogues but I am not agree with this idea. Also If ppl coordinates and report we wont need to see where enemies are going. That's why must be selected pvp oriented players (arena and RATED Bgs players not afkers on the spawning stone in EotS or in the AV cave) than casual more pve oriented players.. A lot of ppl will think me moron for this statement because there must not have a selections but come on ... this is PVP zone for ppl who knows how to coordinate with other ppl and how to organize defending or attacking not for some mid fighters who doesn't know where are their heads.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you can call out where the defenders are going all day long<br />
the problem is with spawning in the middle the defense can get to the base and cap it before the offense can make it there from any of the bases. That's not including mopping up the remaining horde at the base the offense just attacked. <br />
<br />
Killing the defense is an advantage for them &lt;- thats the fundamental flaw with tol barad</div></div><hr />

The only time the larger faction has the advantage is late at night when there are fewer players on so they are more likely to meet the 25 min player cap than the other team. <br />
<br />
Here is the ONLY thing they need to change. Seriously it would keep it competitive without changing the way the game is played. <br />
<br />
Just increase the size of the &quot;cap&quot; part of the bases status bars. That way it takes longer to uncap a base giving the attackers more time to get all three.<br />
Yea the late at night stuff is pretty much how Tol Barad switches hands on most places, if any switching happens.<br />
<br />
I'd say to even things out a bit, make it so the defenders actualy have to defend more, insted of taking most of the people and attacking the least defended base, capping it, and pretty much going in a circle with a zerg. Like if the defending side attacks a unguarded base, they have to actualy stay the time there and defend, insted of getting a realtively quick cap since there's like 30 people there. Attackers still gotta attack, and cut through those 30, while keeping a eye on the others, defense actualy has to do more to defend sides keep 30 people at one base so the attackers can't cap the third base.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tol Barad sucks because the respawns are right next to the point you're defending/attacking. Also Horde/Ally can basicly gather all players at 1 spot and defend for the remaining time.<br />
<br />
IMO the easiest fix to tol barad is to make it last for a set amount of time, whoever has the most bases when time runs out wins.</div></div><hr />

To fix what was happing in wg u made the q to get in 1 for 1 which sounds fair on an unbalenced server but really is not. The side with the lower population aka alliance can literally que up with a full guild or premade team while the other side aka horde is lucky too even get one of their guildmatets in TB to begin with. Since TB came out i have got que to it maybe 3 times total of queing about 20. And the only time i got the que was at a low popular our like 6 am. I don't know how you can make this a fun zone at all if the majoriy of the server can't even play it. Just make it a bg and take out the world pvp part imo. But as long as one faction dominates the other in population per server, it will never be balenced. sorry to burst your bubble blizz.<br />
<br />
And lastly plz make bgs award more honor. Being horde and haveing 10-20 min bg ques to win about 200 honor IF we win is really not cool. Thank you.<br />
<br />
Then maybe half the horde (smaller side on my server) shouldn't have transferred to alliance because &quot;they always have WG&quot; now all they're doing is crying about it.</div></div><hr />

That's the point though. If you can't &quot;l2 pvp&quot; you don't deserve to have it. Because of wrath (at least that's what everyone says) people feel entitled to having access to that raid. No, you shouldn't. It's a reward for whichever side is better at pvp. You aren't promised access to it, and you shouldn't ever have access to it unless you are better. <br />
<br />
Almost every single one of the QQ posts seem like they are from pve people who feel entitled to having it. I think their goal speaks for itself. IF you are good enough, take it. If not, suck it up and try again. That's exactly how it should be.</div></div><hr />

It isn't about equal access to quests and rewards or enjoying pvp combat, to them it is about forcing a 'sense of urgency' on people to fight in terribly one-sided battles and to see their efforts have no fruition for hours, even days as they wait for the defenders to fall asleep or for particularly incompetent opponents. I really hoped they had learned the lessons of WG but for one good thing (forcing equal team size) they introduced numerous features which I have taken issue with. I have pvp'd since classic, when all we really had was world pvp at southshore and redridge mts. I have watched pvp evolve and with this expansion I genuinely think that the developers are taking a sharp step in the wrong direction. If they fail to see what TB has done in scaring away casual pvp or new players who think ALL pvp = lolbarad then I truly worry about what they have in store for future zone pvp and pvp development in general.</div></div><hr />

First time same side Defending : nothing<br />
Second time same side Defending : attackers directly get the buff to drive siege vehicules<br />
Third time same side Defending : buff for vehicules + 5 % dmg , healing and life buff<br />
Fourth time same side Defending : buff for vehicules + 10 % dmg , healing and life buff<br />
Fifth time same side Defending : buff for vehicules + 15 % dmg , healing and life buff<br />
<br />
ect ect ect ... so even if the attackers are really noob , at one point they'll get like +50% buff or more , and finally get Tol Barad back .

They should have portals at each tower so if one is getting attacked you can teleport into it. It would be it easier to defend. People might think well then no one would ever lose defending, but give the attackers a bigger buff the less amount of time there is left.</div></div><hr />

Except it's a pvp zone... <br />
<br />
Personally, I believe the raid boss in a pvp zone should give conquest points and ONLY pvp gear.. nothing to benefit PvE. This keeps it from being balanced SOLELY around the fact that non-so-bright pve'ers want their pve benefit without having to pvp.<br />
<br />
I would agree with you ; I hate WoW's *current* PVP and I dislike this mixture of PvE and PvP in this zone, I would never go here again if they made this the case and I would be much happier for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're not being clear. Imbalanced in what way? In that it favors the defender? Correct. In that it favors any particular faction/class/population balance/day of week/region/realm? Nope. So why is it necessary for a PvP battle to be &quot;balanced&quot;? In the battlegrounds where starting positions are fixed by faction, balance is crucial because one faction will typically win or lose when the terrain favors them. In TB, however, there is no fixed starting location by faction.<br />
<br />
The only reason that this would be a bad idea is if the difference is so large that attackers simply don't try, knowing (or at least believing) that they cannot win. Given that attackers DO win in TB, this isn't a concern right now. As gear levels increase, it will be interesting to see if that changes...<br />

Imbalanced in the way that whether or not a coordinated group got in on offense at 4:00am to win determines which faction controls Tol Barad for the next 24 hours or more.<br />
<br />
An intentional imbalance between offense and defense is nothing short of complete and utter stupidity. Yet, here we are.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AetherMcLoud</div><div class="date">2011-01-10, 11:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are so many problems with tol barad (and also instanced bgs) I can't stop counting:<br />
<br />
1. The queue system doesn't take into account healer balance (same is true for normal bg queues). If 40v40 battle it out, and one side has 15 healers while the other only has 4, the one with the 15 healers will win because they can just hold out much longer while fighting for the bases, therefore capturing them.<br />
<br />
2. Defenders have it way too easy. Let some people annoy the attacker at one base so he is occupied, get rest of raid to zerg around some other base. Switch base if too much attackers in one. Coolio that you spawn right in the middle and can switch bases almost immediately.<br />
<br />
3. The NPC rezzing system. If 15v15 battle it out at a single base, 10 of the attackers die, 4 might be rezzed after 4 seconds, while the others have to wait for 33 seconds because they were unlucky enough to die right before or after the NPC 30 seconds rez timer. Also, Defenders spawn in the middle, then just run to whatever base seems to have less attackers (easy to see from the middle)<br />
<br />
4. The towers, they do nothing!<br />
<br />
5. The siege engines, they are worthless. Towers and Engines made WG unique and fun.<br />
<br />
6. Again, the queue system: If a huge guild group (or even pug trade chat group with teamspeak) joins from the lesser populated side, they will win 99% of the time. Because lots of people want to join from the over populated faction but can't, and they don't have teamspeak and probably some morons that don't listen to tactics in raidchat.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
As some other poster said, the tenacity system could have worked perfectly with just a little tweak. The more tenacity you have the more immune to CC you become (or the longer it takes for diminishing returns on you to reset). It didn't matter in Wintergrasp if each ally had 200k health, they could still be chain stunned, feared, slowed, rooted, and slowly killed without being able to do anything. Also, the vehicles would have to scale with tenacity. But should behave like the SotA vehicles now in regards to CC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tol Barad is a test to see which faction can tactically use the men and women given in the PvP queue system to collectively come together and complete an objective. It's almost RTS in that nature, without the point-and-click type control over 'units'... and it also rewards the most coordinated, and leader-worthy.<br />
<br />
With that being said, Blizzard is ignoring the fact that many players don't care about the battle, or the concept of honor and faction loyalty. They just want to win... the game is not about the story to them, just winning. It's this sad lack of immersion that I think makes TB a failfest, because people who don't listen (or care enough to listen), and just going to ignore strategy and end up gimping the faction they are on...<br />
<br />
You sir just capture my mind set of Tol barad, for this you win 20 Internets.<br />

There's just nothing else to add to this post, players just don't care about the code of honor and yes most players are just ignoring strategy and ended up being a dead weight in Tol Barad.<br />

<br />
The lesson that they should've drawn from Wintergrasp was how in Wintergrasp, the defending team couldn't necessarily just turtle on the fortress and kill incoming vehicles, but that there was a strong incentive to split up to control at least one vehicle factory in order to take down the towers. Had Wintergrasp not had that design element, it would have played out exactly like Tol Barad is playing out now.<br />
<br />
All they would have to do in order to make Tol Barad have sufficiently balanced gameplay is to create any reason whatsoever for the defending team to feel compelling to split up in some way, and the fact that this blue post does not even remotely address that core issue is very troubling.</div></div><hr />

&quot;watched over&quot;-controlled pvp enviroments cannot quite capture the exhilarating essence that a world pvp sceario would.Have people form their own raids and go after certain targets for blood and glory and reward them for doing so.<br />
we need to see something unique in order for it to be truly treated &quot;unique&quot; by players.This is especially true in these times where we are seeing more or less of the same thing e.g rated bg's being a &quot;much larger&quot; arena combat situation and Tol barad just being a BG with a 2hour cd.</div></div><hr />

In that it favors the defender? Correct. In that it favors any particular faction/class/population balance/day of week/region/realm? Nope. So why is it necessary for a PvP battle to be &quot;balanced&quot;? In the battlegrounds where starting positions are fixed by faction, balance is crucial because one faction will typically win or lose when the terrain favors them. In TB, however, there is no fixed starting location by faction.<br />
<br />
Actually, I think TB heavily favors the underpopulated faction on low-pop servers. Every time my friends and I queue, only 1 of 5 gets in. On the Alliance side, however, the premade is guaranteed to get in until their side is capped at 100. This rarely happens on my server. Therefore, the PuG Horde gets pummeled by premade Alliance groups. It's terrible, and Blizzard's proposed changes will not fix this.</div></div><hr />

tb is f*cked up. the difference between defenders and attackers is to big. i mean you have 2 40 man groups against eachother. the attackers have to get 3 bases and defend them till the end of the battle to be able to win it. the defenders just need to keep a minimum of 1 base till the end of the battle to win the battleground. is it just me or is this verry verry flawed? on the one side you have the 40 attackers that have to devide themselves between 3 bases to get them and defend them. on the other side you have a group of 40 defenders that can just run around in one big group from one base to the next, overkill every attacker they meet and just keep a minimum of 1 base.and yes i know that tb was designed so that the defenders should defend the 3 towers and the 3 bases; but be honest. if you can just groupnuke every attacker in sight because your in a 40 man group. why even bother defending the towers. who cares if the battle takes about 10 min longer or not. <br />
it would be far more ballanced if it was somewhat like this. the attackers need a minimum of 2 bases to win. the defenders need a minimum of 2 bases to win. there are 3 bases.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">biturbo</div><div class="date">2011-01-10, 11:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This expansion has been incredibly good so far, in my opinion, but Tol Barad is the lone disappointment. The design of this zone is so unbelievably bad, I don't know how they didn't see the problems sooner.<br />
<br />
1) I disagree that having it change hands infrequently is better. On one of my servers, we as Horde had WG almost all the time. As time progressed, fewer and fewer Alliance showed up to try to take it. It ended up sucking for both sides (obviously more so for Alliance who never had access to VoA). I don't think it should be easy to win as the attacker, but it shouldn't be substantially more difficult than defending. If it were up to me, it would be slightly easier than defending.<br />
<br />
2) The basic premise of this battle is flawed. If you have equal numbers on both sides, and one side has to hold all 3 points to win but the other only needs to hold one to win, that is never going to be close to fair. They can (and probably will) try some cheap things to even it out a bit, but ultimately the foundation of this battle is broken. The only reasonable way I think they could bandaid this would be to let the attacker have more people than the defender, which may be kind of interesting in some ways.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, any reasonable competent defending team can beat an equally (or somewhat more) competent attacker quite easily by just zerging to the empty base. I thought it was kind of funny that the designer mentioned &quot;turtling&quot; as a defense strategy they wanted to discourage with the changes - turtling is already probably the worst strategy, as there's a chance the attacker could overpower you in that one spot, but a zerg is hard to deal with.<br />
<br />
As a PvP enthusiast, I had hope that they'd overhaul Tol Barad to make it fun and interesting, but after reading Mumper's post, I think it will be something to ignore for the rest of the expansion.</div></div><hr />

well actualy on my server the alliance won wintergrasp most of the times. acording to the litle book in the inner sanctum thingy the alliance had the highest nr of defences won and the highest nr of attacks won. but to be honest, wintergrasp is as far as i've seen in battlegrounds and other pvp the only thing on our server that the alliance was anny good at.</div></div><hr />

At the very least they could make some kind of priority system that favours people in a raid or party and tracks how many times a players fails to enter TB so there isn't cases where you queue several times in a row and still can't get in. It really takes dedication at the moment on the populated side of a server with a 90/10 pop ratio to get into TB<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I don't see blizz changing the imbalance problem seeing how profitable it is to force players to pay for xfers... And looking at the comments about the issue on forums where players blame each other instead of blaming blizz, the solution won't come from the community either. Also TB sucking ass is probably not a big enough incentive to make people mass quit Wow, so it's safe to say TB will continue sucking for a long time.<br />

Personnaly i'll just avoid the place like a plague until it looks balanced for all factions.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kingmob</div><div class="date">2011-01-11, 12:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;As we mentioned earlier, the attacking faction is having a pretty tough time winning control of Tol Barad -- and we're OK with that, at least in theory. Here's why: When we set out to create Wintergrasp, one of the issues we dealt with was that we were never able to ensure the sides were even -- in fact, they rarely were. Because the smaller team would almost always be assured defeat, we attempted to address team-size imbalance by favoring the attacker. Control of Wintergrasp went back and forth, and the result was that battles lost their impact. On most realms the defenders became complacent, knowing they were likely to lose control of the zone, returning to re-take it when it was their turn to attack. The sides swapped back and forth every few hours, and Wintergrasp wasn’t so much about an epic struggle for a meaningful piece of land as it was a complicated game of leapfrog.&quot;<br />
<br />
That *never* happened on my server. Horde representation is minuscule so even with the tenacity buff they were never able to take control. Alliance had WG on lockdown. Regardless of that specific experience however I still don't understand how they tried to solve win-trading with more win-trading.</div></div><hr />

A simple buff like that won't really help much. It would have to be a rather large, tenacity-like buff that would make the battle un-fun like tenacity did in WG.<br />

Maybe each tower destroyed could unlock a certain number of extra slots for the attackers? I don't know. If they are bent on keeping the basic idea (ie, attackers have to hold all 3 to win), I think the way you fix it is to somehow allow more attackers than defenders.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My server has about 80:20 ratio ally:horde players. Most of the horde players are PvP ones since well, theres shit load of ally to kill. So now we have a situation that most of horde players in TB group are PVPers in good equip, while on Ally side you have most of the ppl in PvE equip just collecting those marks for the trinkets. So usualy 80% of ally group are just idiots that dont really know whats going on in attacking, and horde side has about 80% of ppl that know whats going on and dont have a problem to defend it.<br />
<br />
When some miracle happens and Ally actualy wins Tol Barad, its pretty slim chance there will be a good group again to defend it but its a big chance horde goup will have good group on attacking and take it back. So for the most time Horde has it.<br />
<br />
Is Tol Barad balanced with same group number on each side....yes it is. Is it balanced on same chance to win it....not on my server :)<br />
<br />
In last week, i would login during a day randomly to check do we have TB, only once it was ally. Im pretty sure there was more times when we had it, but for that you prolly need to check after each battle cuz its pretty rare.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A lot of people with so much built up frustration towards Blizzard. You'd think they lack free will or something and are being forced to feed the Blizzard money machine. <br />
<br />
Now even though I just insulted the most of you, I do agree with a lot of the comments here that Tol Barad is a gigantic mess, and shouldn't have gone live as it's obvious there's a lot of work left to be done. To me it seems they tried to fix two imbalances at the same time, only creating a bigger one. They fixed the numbers issue by making the teams the same size. However, they also fixed the issue of attacking being too easy by making it much harder. In my opinion the only issue with WG on my server was the fact that the Alliance largely outnumbered the horde, and that was why they always lost, even after said &quot;attacker favor.&quot; I think with the numbers issue fixed (not in the best way but better than nothing I guess) they should balance the jobs of each team more. The attackers may only need to take two objectives so the defenders are forced to defend two and the attackers are forced to attack two. <br />

The Alliance is going to have a tough time in any BG just because we're Alliance, there's no need to make it worse by making a BG that's intentionally unbalanced.<br />
<br />
There are other ways to make the battle feel meaningful. In fact, it already does feel quite meaningful because if you spend a whole day without capturing Tol Barad then you don't get access to the dailies. That was incentive enough for me to continue trying Tol Barad even though I was usually on the attacking side which means I was probably just wasting my time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was talking to a few guildies a while ago and brought up the idea of giving attackers an ICC type zone buff for how many bases you held. So lets say 5% for one and 10% for two.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And Wintergrasp was meaningful to everyone especially with the high turnover rate of possession ... until they made the quests there Weekly-resetting quests instead of Dailies.<br />
<br />
And I guarantee if someone goes and digs up the blue post explanation for when they nerfed the WG Daily quests and compares it to this new blue post they'll get a real good laugh.<br />
<br />
Nevermind the myriad of other reasons why Wintergrasp didn't have as much 'meaning' as Tol Barad would right now... most obvious being that Wintergrasp only offered rewards that pertained to PvP (read: PvP trinkets/resilience gear), whereas Tol Barad's rewards are novelty and PvE rewards, and right now PvE epic gear is scarce and more difficult to come by compared to WotLK.<br />
<br />
WG participation at the start was very high because everyone wanted to do the quests for gold and honor. When they removed the dailies and made them weekly, it was under the guise of lessening the load on the server by attempting to curb participation. This was followed by huge honor nerfs across the board for WG.<br />
<br />
This of course drastically reduced participation and imbalanced and neglected servers started to see the scenario where the overpopulated side started holding for long periods of time. This was not helped when they nerfed/buffed the internal balancing mechanism to favor the overpopulated side even more in patch 3.3.5.<br />
<br />
Obviously once the 120 cap was in place (and eventually the 1-for-1 cap), none of the above measures were reverted, to go along with ignoring obvious suggestions that were posted on the PTR repeatedly from 3.1 onwards. What a farce the whole zone turned into.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Remove the center defense graveyard spawn and divide the graveyard to the three destructible towers. When someone on the defense dies a graveyard tower is randomly selected where they will spawn. If the tower is destroyed by the offense, that graveyard is then moved to the center.<br />
<br />
This would keep the defense from being to mobilize and zerg cap points as quickly or as efficiently without good communication. Having the graveyard move back to the center would also make the offensive team more inclined to spend time destroying towers if the time is needed.<br />
<br />
I think this would dramatically change the battle since the current tower situation would also be improved. If the timer is long on the battle, the offense would be less inclined to place siege vehicles there, and the defense would be less inclined to destroy them if they were. If the timer was low, the battle would shift slightly to a more tower oriented fight. The offense would want them down for the extra time, and the defense would want them up to try to end the battle.<br />

And now we see why WOW has been sucking so much lately. Lead content designer..... and cannot even acknowledge there is a problem.

If he truely knew what was going on with this BG, this would not be his viewpoint. Some servers may have more balanced players than other, but what I know is this; Ghostlands has been horde for days on end ever since the change back from 1800 per win to 360. Only just recently have we been able to gain control, and this has only been late at night when there is only ~15 people attending. Losing is not really a threat to the defender. AT. ALL. And why? Because all you have to do to retain it, is turtle on ONE flag. Get everyone to one area and mow them down as they come around the corner. There needs to be some other mechanic in place. SOMETHING needs to change.</div></div><hr />

Since win trading stopped alliance has not held TB once on my server, no one even ques up for it because they know they will lose. A typical TB raid only had 5 -10 people in it. Anyone in heroic pve gear going against someone in full arena gear is just going to lose. So why bother when the odds are so stacked against?</div></div><hr />

<br />
/facepalm<br />
<br />
There was no lack of incentive to try and take TB, idiot, hence the high level of frustration in the difficulty of assaulting. Everyone wants to control it in order to do the dailys. The lacking part is the mechanics, which are simply awful in design. Who let the intern write the press release?<br />
<br />
On my server, the Wintergrasp assaulter won the battle about 75-80% of the time, allowing everyone control and ample time to enjoy it. I'd much prefer that system to the current, opposite setup.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My suggestion:<br />
<br />
I'll make it short and sweet. <br />
<br />
Imaging the tenacity buff.. Instead of being contained to a battle and stacked based off of imblance. Have it be:<br />
<br />
Battle 1:<br />
<br />
A defeats B<br />
<br />
Battle 2: Tenacity stack = 0<br />
<br />
A defeats B again<br />
<br />
Battle 3: Tenacity stack = 1<br />
<br />
A defeats B again <br />
<br />
Battle 4 tenacity stack = 2<br />
<br />
B defeats A <br />
<br />
Battle 5: Stack is reset to Zero<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This gives a winning team an easy time defending one time but increases difficulty of defense slowly over time.<br />
<br />
Defenses that break down over time... Kind of like in a real war.. If you're defending a base over time your defenses will dwindle structures will give way.<br />
<br />
Anyway thanks for Tol Barad. Fun BG and I support the desire to have a world BG not feel like a fleeting victory. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

That they make Tol Bard important is immaterial when it comes to the ability to take it. As a decent PvE player, but inept PvPer, the best thing I can do for TB is stay out of it.

What I missed about Wintergrasp, even in its unbalanced state, was that it felt epic. Sure, WG came to basically be a &quot;Horde zone we let the Alliance play in for an hour at 4 AM&quot; - and they had themselves to thank for it when the big cheese of the Alliance said that they only took WG on Tuesdays for the raid, thereby ruining it for all the other Alliance as they never saw the inside of WG on a Tuesday until Cata dropped, but at its peak, WG was epic. And it was fun to to both things, to be the horde (note the lack of capitals) rushing the gates like something out of Braveheart, or my personal favorite, holding out until the last possible moment defending. Outmanned, outgunned, and holding the line while three or four tried their damnedest to get that last tower down. There is none of that in TB.<br />
<br />
Six minutes left on the clock. There's a hole in both outer courtyards, and the front gate of the main one is down. Eastern inner wall is cracked. They're coming hard and fast through the front gate. Seiges, Demos, Cats dropping plague on the ranged/healers. Suddenly it flashes across our screens &quot;The Relic Door is Damaged!&quot;. What, how? We look to see a boulder sail over the cracked eastern wall and slam into the door, just as the wall falls, revealing the lone Demo that was firing over the lowered wall. Alliance pour in through the hole. Our Catas and Demos move to hold the line, RPGs flying everywhere. The lag, man! My god, the lag! There are three people in catapults heading for that last tower, one of which is my guildmate Singer. That tower's got a defense team on it. It's getting frantic. We can't afford to lose a single player or a single vehicle. Our defense is spreading thin, they're yanking us apart or knocking us around, trying to keep us disorganized and in a state of damage control rather than solid defense. Singer's in our vent, and you can hear that he's got his teeth grit, his jaw set, and even his toes curled as they push to break their defense.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just hold on, they've got ... hold on! Just hold on a minute longer!&quot;<br />
<br />
Three minutes to go, and we've got crack teams swarming through their front lines to obliterate any Demo or Cata they can find. Three minutes left, and there's a sliver of HP left on the relic door. Suddenly Singer explodes over vent. &quot;D'S DOWN, HITTING THE TOWER! HOLD ON! HOLY SHIT!&quot; The relic door explodes into rubble. My husband and my guild leader who was tanking a Siege like it was an NPC yells out over vent &quot;SINGER, TAKE DOWN THAT GODDAMN TOWER NOW!&quot; The Alliance push through into the chamber, millimeters away from capping the relic.<br />
<br />
The tower falls.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Horde has defended Wintergrasp!&quot;<br />
<br />
There was no quarter given in the Wintergrasp Fortress courtyard that day.<br />
<br />
Indeed, why dont they upgrade WG into 85 content? Vechicles now in WG doesnt scale with gear and health pool, there is no way to take down a tower or a gate now.<br />
<br />
I dont understand their insist on favouring defenders... Isnt losing dailies and the hold for 2 hours give them pretty enough motivation to hold the line? Do they need to add in -50dkp for losers to generate enough motivation?</div></div><hr />

It is not a good PvP battle. The most effective defensive strategy is to avoid combat. If you see a zerg coming, go out the other door and recap what they just capped. As some others have pointed out, turtling (and fighting) at the last node is the only way you can lose TB as the defenders ( it is still unlikely though). If you want to always win as the defenders, NEVER fight.. just let the zerg come, run around them, and recap behind them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know what to say to this other than: no. You and others are arguing a player skill issue when that's not even the problem at hand here. The problem is that the defense doesn't even have to HOLD a base to win, in a fight where the attackers need all three bases in possession. You don't even need to be past third grade (or whatever that equivalent is should you not be familiar with the states) to figure out how stupid/broken that is. That's not even taking into account queuing issues, or the fact that, at least on my server, the Alliance guards don't do shit when twenty horde come to camp the spawn portal because they couldn't 1v1 a tree and win, yet the horde guards tear you a new one without hesitation, or the respawn rate issues making it near impossible to solo the dailies when more than twenty of anyone are in the same area. I'm sure there's more, but the point is the zone has a metric ton of issues.<br />
<br />
They could honestly do ANYTHING, ANYTHING to fix this, and all we're getting is a 'we'll take a look and maybe tinker with some stuff, but no promises'. That's like being a shaman in BC, hearing 'we'll take a look at shamans for fixing' and then seeing in the patch notes 'Stormstrike has a brand new icon'. You would rather them have said 'fuck you, it's fine' because then you'd know where they were standing, instead of some half-ass jargon that was thrown together in a few minutes to cover their shit in a piss-poor and infuriating manner all while being indefinite. I guess until they decide to take their heads out of the sand, we'll have to deal with the PvP equivalent of new icons. Fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On my PvE server there is a heavy imbalance towards alliance. This means basically for every 1 horde, there is 2-3 alliance at basically any given time.<br />
Now this imbalance when translated into a fight like TB results in the following:<br />
<br />
30 of our top notch Alliance PvPers sign in. 4-5 get through, rest of the raid is filled with pve randoms.<br />
<br />
30 top notch Horde PvPers sing in. All of them get through.<br />
<br />
By far the most common complaint on my server is that simply our good alliance pvpers barely get in due to the mass of randoms. And this isn't just at prime time, this is even at 3 am saturday morning. It is never a fair fight untill groups/raids signing up get priority. Or heck, even if resilience was a measure to get prio or something.<br />
<br />
Besides, as PvEer I wouldn't care about the whole place if it didn't have the best caster trinket on exhalted or 2 mounts and a minipet for my &quot;casual&quot; collection. Or the damn BH boss didn't drop Tier PvE gear, which is otherwise still very scarce.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only real advantage the BG gives the defense is that the attackers must cap all 3 nodes. That is it.<br />
<br />
The central rez has no innate advantage to defense. The distance from central spawn to node is exactly half the node to node distance. They are closer to any particular node than attackers BUT it takes them the same amount of time to rez and get to a node from the the spawn as it takes a rider to travel from node to node. The reason for this is the rez timer and slowfall. There is a small variation thanks to the rez timer randomness. If a defender doesn't get or turns off slowfall most classes will take a decent damage hit when they land.<br />
<br />
You want to win attacking TB? <br />
<br />
Move fast. The entire attacking zerg is not needed to turn a node you just cleared of defenders, so leave a few to finish and defend the cap and move on. If you kill well enough and move fast enough you will win. It really is that simple. As an attacker if you have more than 5 (depending on your total numbers) on a node and your combat status drops it's time for you to be riding to the next node. If the horde are capping behind your zerg too quickly then keep increasing how many you leave protecting the nodes you have taken. You will eventually find a magic number that will hold long enough for you to get the third node capped.<br />
<br />
You want someone to blame for not winning, look at yourself and your faction, because you move too slow. Blizz is very well aware that they have built a BG with a slight, but not insurmountable, advantage to D. Any significant changes they make to that balance will be to handicap good players on D in favor of bad players on O. We all know they aren't above doing such a thing, but it's pretty obvious in TB's case that they consider it a last resort. It's why they tried to buff the reward for winning rather than tweak the BG, they know it's a player personality issue not an inherent design flaw.<br />
<br />
You want proof? I give you Suramar. My server's alliance population taken as a whole, are some god-awful pvpers. Horde roll out. Since Cata has come out I can count on one hand how many times I've seen that they have actually earned a (non-win trade) TB win attacking. Every time it has happened it has taken the Horde less than a day to get it back.<br />
The better pvp faction controls the zone earned from pvp. Sorry, but that is way it should be.</div></div><hr />

So you're saying that Cory acknowledging the balance is borked, and they having the change on third base cap is stupid, and 90% of people, including developers, are wrong, and it's fine because you have a vision on how things work in a single server, and that vision you have is automatically truth for the whole world?<br />
Yeah, sure, STOP EVERYTHING, we all are wrong.Just leave that way. Everything is fine.</div></div><hr />

You fail at reading. I said Blizzard made a BG with a slight but not insurmountable advantage to D. I used Suramar as an example to illustrate my point. Horde is the better PVP faction on that server. The quality of the players involved is what is skews a slight advantage to a nearly insurmountable one for alliance on Suramar. Alliance is the weaker pvp faction, Horde is stronger . . . Horde wins TB probably better than 90% of the time defending OR attacking. Get it?<br />
<br />
I honestly thought for a while like, everyone else, that TB was just horribly skewed against the attackers. I felt a little bad for the allies, but not much. :-P But then I saw finally saw the Horde on offense. Would it be harder if Suramar alliance was better? Sure, but it wouldn't be impossible.<br />
<br />
Were I to have the power to change TB it would be to remove the PVE aspect from the joint. Leave the raid but make the rewards PVP only. Then only the people who actually care about pvp would bother with it. That would solve the biggest balance issue TB has. Having a bunch of PVE people who are mostly clueless about PVP locking out the real fighters.</div></div><hr />

have 2 full blown PVP grps that can actually work together towards a common goal.</div></div><hr />

Even if you yourself are a good player, if your faction is bad at pvp comparatively, then you're going to pay for it in TB, and you're going to pay a lot. I think that the attackers should have a slight advantage, not like defenders have now obviously, but enough that attackers would win 60-70% of the time if they have the same skill as the defenders. That way everyone gets a turn owning TB, but it's still possible to hang on to it longer than normal through skill. It shouldn't be the other way around, that only through insurmountable skill and/or waiting til the entire other faction is sleeping can a victory be achieved.</div></div><hr />

Everything they are &quot;ok with&quot; makes this entire expansion gimped, imbalanced and un-fun.

^ This. Took 5 tries to get the achievement for winning ... and I don't bother joining TB at all now. Wintergrasp was FUN, I enjoyed wintergrasp. I sit around waiting at the camp near the portal until the fights over. If we win, I go get the dailies then leave. If we don't, I go farm leather until the next fight ... then rinse and repeat. Why waste my time in a BG that is to annoying to win and don't get a good enough reward for it? 100-300 honor isn't worth the time it takes.</div></div><hr />

so maybe a nice buff for the attacking side for destroying all 3 towers would help that way the defending side would need to send players to defend the towers and it would it would give a huge boost for the attacking side in the dying minutes of the game</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Richtea</div><div class="date">2011-01-11, 11:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I love TB. It's hit #2 spot in my list of favorite BGs, even with the defender bias.<br />
Just to qualify, my server is 3:1 (or there abouts) horde to ally, with the horde being slightly more PvP orientated. Despite this, TB swaps sides roughly 2-3 times a day (don't know about nighttime).<br />
<br />
Having read the wall of blue, I'm actually looking forward to the changes. There's nothing actually flawed with an imbalanced BG providing both sides have access to both attack and defence, just in TB you actually have to win on attack in order to qualify for the much easier defence job. It rewards better/smarter/more organised play, great. But, they've noted that the (im)balance isn't quite there yet and have told you how they're going to fix it.<br />
<br />
Lets for a minute take a look at the way the BG works (or at least the way I understand it), say you need 1000 &quot;points&quot; to cap a base. You get a certain number of points per player at that node, plus you get a fixed number per &quot;kill&quot; at that node (there's probably a fair bit more to it than just that, but that'll do for now), this favours the defender who can either sit in one base and hold it till time up, or can just move the majority of his forces on to take another in the same time it takes the attacker to cap the remaining one.<br />
<br />
What has been said is, the &quot;points&quot; needed to take the final base are being reduced, if you already have two.<br />
<br />
Now lets say you now only need 800 to cap that final base, suddenly, turtling isn't so attractive for the defender as their &quot;buffer&quot; for the fixed kill &quot;points&quot; at a base is smaller; if the attacker gets a sudden streak of kills (and they have the shorter gy run afterall, so can mana drain the defenders with their corpses) they can take it from under them. Likewise, you can't rush from one base to another because you'll take longer to grab the next base than the other side will capturing the one you just left.<br />
Now, the defender has to worry about defending two bases rather than just the one.<br />
<br />
Making the towers more meaningful would be nice as well, but all in all, I like what's been said.</div></div><hr />

Players on our realm aren't motivated for an uphill battle - Wintergrasp was an uphill battle for the larger and last parts of Wrath as well. While I like the design philosophy that the battle should matter, Blizzard needs to realize that losing a battle constantly is not motivating and will result in players not enjoying the battle at all. In Wintergrasp, there were still mechanics that empowered the attacking faction the more they failed to seize control of the zone so that even if the faction wasn't winning at all, eventually the zone control would shift regardless.<br />
<br />
In a couple of days I will have my Drake from Tol Barad and after that I am never going back at the zone. I know a lot of guild mates and friends who feel the same way, the grind and PvP feels horrible and it's only something we take on because of the rewards. The zone is overcamped, the battles aren't any fun and the only reason for us to really participate is the unique rewards from the daily quests - once we have that we won't bother doing it anymore. Tol Barad isn't going to last an expansion's life-time, it's going to last until the first wave of players have their rewards then it's going to become an extremely underpopulated zone that nobody cares about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tol Barad is a test to see which faction can tactically use the men and women given in the PvP queue system to collectively come together and complete an objective. It's almost RTS in that nature, without the point-and-click type control over 'units'... and it also rewards the most coordinated, and leader-worthy.<br />
<br />
With that being said, Blizzard is ignoring the fact that many players don't care about the battle, or the concept of honor and faction loyalty. They just want to win... the game is not about the story to them, just winning. It's this sad lack of immersion that I think makes TB a failfest, because people who don't listen (or care enough to listen), and just going to ignore strategy and end up gimping the faction they are on...<br />
