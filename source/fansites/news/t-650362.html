Tauren Skin Tones changes in Patch 3.2<br />
Tauren will be able to change skin tone using the barber shop when the new form art is released in the next major content patch. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/17367750578-the-main-problem-with-new-forms.html))<br />
<br />
Patch 3.2 ETA<br />
We don't give out dates or estimates on when patches will be released, but it will definitely need to be on the PTR for awhile before it will be released and since it is not up on the PTR it will be awhile. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/17368010944-eta-on-valiant-quest-replacement.html))<br />
<br />
Adding content to the game<br />
What this question is really relating to is something that happens during development of any content so I will try and give a quick example that hopefully makes sense.<br />
<br />
Lets say we start out with 10 (arbitrary number for this example) things we want to implement. During the development we cut out 2 of them that we feel weren't as cool as we originally wanted, then later on, we cut 2 other things because we don't have the time for them and prefer to focus on the other 6 items. Just because these 4 things were cut doesn't mean they aren't in the game files in some primitive form (e.g. blank spots of land), they are just things that players don't have access to.<br />
<br />
Any content that gets cut is something we may end up taking a look at it again in the future, but only if we feel it is a good time and will be a be a really positive addition to the game. We are totally fine with putting it off for years/indefinitely (hi Ravasaur trainer!) if necessary too especially when there are new ideas that we feel are better and will add more to the game, even if it means going in an Outland-ish direction. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/17367750867-blizzard-azeroth-zones-underdevelopment.html))<br />
<br />
Argent Tournament<br />
ETA on Valiant Quest Replacement?<br />
Since this change will require a fair amount of work it won't happen until patch 3.2. And yes, we have more changes planned than just letting you do the valiant quests, a lot more changes really. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/17368010944-eta-on-valiant-quest-replacement.html))<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
Healer Mana Regen<br />
We did recognize that healer mana was too potent in Naxxramas, and we did take some steps to fix it. Unfortunately, nerfing mana regen has two negative effects:<br />
<br />
1) Healers feel really singled out. They feel like we are making the encounter tougher merely by making their jobs harder. Now, obviously when we think we need to make a change to the game we'll make it even if it upsets some people. However players having fun in their role definitely factors into that.<br />
<br />
2) If raid-buffed mana regen is at acceptable levels, then it tends to be much too low when solo, in 5-player dungones and in Arena. This is not just a Replenishment issue -- there are plenty of stat scaling buffs that may not be present in smaller groups either.<br />
<br />
I'll also add that high avoidance plays into this problem too. When tanks can dodge or parry 50% or more of attacks (to pick a random number) then bosses have to hit twice as hard when they do connect. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/17367880861-block-is-useless-because-of-overhealing.html))<br />

Lack of customization on new forms?<br />
We do understand that it's taken us a long time to get out some updates for druid forms. Like anything else that has time to sit and be digested, we understand that most people want nothing less than everything they've ever dreamed or desired on an individual level. From a design stand point though, we have to make decisions we feel will have a moderately low negative impact, with a relatively high positive impact. We feel providing five different color schemes for two of the most outdated models for druids is a huge bonus. We feel strongly that druids will be happy to look at any of the five different color schemes for each form over the ones that currently exist once they see them in-game and have a chance to grow used to them. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/17367980894-reason-some-druids-are-disappointed.html))<br />
<br />
New Bear/Cat Forms colors<br />
Much in the way specific physical features (i.e. horns, eyes, facial shape, etc.) found on bear and cat forms resemble the races to which they are linked, we feel it makes sense to tie the color schemes of these forms to the most identifiable coloring options of their respective races: hair color for night elves, and skin tone for tauren. <br />
<br />
Potentially more changes to forms in the future<br />
Definitely. They just won't be done for the next major content patch. We plan to revamp all of the forms, and may continue to iterate upon the new forms coming out with additional color schemes, adding armor or additional customization, etc. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/17367980894-reason-some-druids-are-disappointed.html))<br />

Hunters and locks were OP already, its not you time, as well as rogues were OP in BC and now we are ok as you see..<br />

Paladins need some time to shine. This is the first expansion they can actually dps. hunters have had a few runs in the OP spotlight. <br />

GC got their kill on early 5/28, but it wasn't posted here until 5/29...so i'm pretty sure the posting is correct and GC had the first US kill</div></div><hr />

If thats accurate, as it seems to be, GC had the US-first, world 5th. I don't know the timing for Methods kill, so it might be world 4th or something, but definately seems to be the US-first. Gratz to them.</div></div><hr />

They're the same itemlevel and I'm pretty sure the agi + sockets will end up giving you a bit more benefit than the 90 ap difference.</div></div><hr />

It seems (quite rightly) that people get banned for writing 'first' but why does the site keep posting first kills - that's basically the same? <br />
WHO CARES that some guild has killed something *FIRST!*?<br />
<br />
Apparently those who post care, I just think its odd. Thankfully you can only do it once so these kind of first posts get squelched fairly quickly.</div></div><hr />

You seem to have missed the post recently saying the Algalon weapons had been moved to other bosses as well...but you are correct that it can, in fact, drop off of Hodir hard mode.<br />

<br />
<br />
Tracking world/us/eu firsts is nothing new to this game, or any MMO. It is merely informational and you will continue to see first kill posts clear through the end of this website on the front page. Also...the first posts being made by guilds are generally being made in the &quot;Ulduar US First kills&quot; or &quot;Ulduar EU First kills&quot; forum, so they are being posted in a forum that was created for that very purpose, again for informational reasons. As long as they are keeping those posts to the forum that has been set up for them, which is not always the case to be fair, then the comparison between these posts and people that post &quot;FIRST!!&quot; seems relatively unfounded imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
may be you will give us more details of the quest?<br />
yeah yeah yeah...every season i watch over pvpers and their whine =))<br />
<br />
Yeah paladin pvp playstyle is /castsequence 3 spells and the target is dead, but nothing will happen till the next season as you see it was with DKS.<br />
Hunters and locks were OP already, its not you time, as well as rogues were OP in BC and now we are ok as you see..<br />
<br />
and remember this expansion is based on Paladin and DK lore so... =))<br />
<br />
<br />
so you actually want 2-3 classes to be OP, and not have the game pritty much balanced?<br />
<br />
anyways i dont want to be OP, i'm tired of getting killed by paladins 1v1 during the 1 stun where i am unable to do anything, this is with 700 resi. i honestly must say you can't say burst dmg is fine.<br />
<br />
and Retri's could dps in BC aswell. just not as close to pure dps classes as they can atm. all they need to do is reduce scalling abit, just like what they did with explosive shot etc. tho there they also reduced base dmg aswell.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Paladins need some time to shine. This is the first expansion they can actually dps. hunters have had a few runs in the OP spotlight. <br />
<br />
Next up is shaman as far as i'm concerned. <br />
<br />
<br />
judging by that shaman is on equal foot with hunters in that case then. shamans had 2 years of glory days in Vanilla.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The more times the correct information is put out there the more likely others will see it, so I don't mind posting the exact same correct information on the same page if there are that many people posting incorrect information at the same frequency.<br />
<br />
You cared enough to point out that the original post was wrong...I cared enough to make sure that the correct information was known. I was not intending to razz you specifically, just make sure why you, and others that may have noticed the same thing, noticed an incongruity that wasn't actually correct.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A little off topic, but what the heck...<br />
<br />
Actually, they're only removing music from the videos that contain music licensed from, or a subsidary of, WMG (Warner Music Group). A fun way to get around this is to search for the artist or song name on Wikipedia, then click the label name on the right hand side. If it has any ties whatsoever to WMG or a subsidary, then when you upload your video, it will be automatically removed. I do this for all videos we upload now, and haven't had a single one with music removed.<br />
<br />
Back on topic, grats on US first.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mushin</div><div class="date">2009-05-30, 03:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, they probably have the numbers, I was wondering how they came up with them. Where did they get the data? Thier own data or a collaboration of data with sites such as Sk gamer?<br />
<br />
<br />
They cull their data from live servers. They have no need to use third party sites because the servers dump large amounts of information on stuff so that Blizzard can inspect them to gauge the state of the game.<br />
They have live data about all kinds of things in the game, like how many people are any given spec, what the least popular talents are, and their representation in arena.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bear in mind that when Blizzard says &quot;low representation in arena&quot; they're talking about all three brackets and at all rating levels, not just the top 100 of 2v2.</div></div><hr />
