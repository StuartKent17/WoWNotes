Ashran Preview: Prepare to Engage<br />
Built upon the remnants of an ogre civilization, Ashran looks deceptively like a nice enough island just off the coast of Tanaan Jungle. And it probably would be a lovely place to visit if not for the never-ending tug-of-war between the Horde and Alliance taking place in the central region of the zone. Then again, this might just be just your kind of excursion.<br />
<br />
Ashran offers tons of opportunities for players to engage in a variety of activities, whether they want to go it solo or join a group, slay monsters, or engage in PvP with their rival faction. <br />
<br />
Building World PvP into Ashran<br />
Over the years, players have been asking for more opportunities to engage in world PvP, and we’ve experimented with a variety of approaches to that in places like Halaa and Wintergrasp. Creating opportunities for unscripted, unexpected skirmishes might seem simple on the surface, but they’re often difficult to engineer without sacrificing the unpredictable nature of these encounters. In its purest form, world PvP means no boundaries or limitations on when skirmishes break out. When creating areas specifically designated for PvP encounters, gameplay objectives will always have an impact on how people play and engage with each other. In the end, many will choose the path of least resistance to achieve their faction’s win condition, and sometimes that path involves simply ignoring other players.<br />
<br />
In order to create the type of atmosphere that encourages more free-form world PvP in Ashran, we decided to apply lessons we’ve learned from the Timeless Isle. By giving players more personal goals and opportunities—such as killing creatures—players are more likely to find themselves spontaneously engaging in PvP to compete for them. We want players to get caught up in the moment and become emotionally invested in the outcome of each new encounter, whether it’s just getting the drop on a member of the opposite faction player or getting revenge for a stolen kill. While Ashran still has plenty of objective-based conflict (more on that in a bit), if you want that distinctive flavor of world PvP, the island has that for you too.<br />
<br />
This Island is No Fantasy<br />
Located off the coast of Tanaan Jungle, Ashran is a large, open PvP zone for players who have reached the max level of 100, and it offers a little something for everyone. Players can reach the island easily a few different ways, including using a flight path or by unlocking quick access within their Garrison once it reaches Tier 3. The more daring—or foolhardy—adventurers could also try doggy paddling to the island, but we don’t recommend it. (Seriously, we wouldn’t try it if we were you. You’ve been warned. In a world where pretty much everything wants to kill you, you’re best off traveling to an island of pure conflict the safest possible way. We really wouldn’t steer you wrong on this one.)<br />
<br />
Unlike previous PvP zones, such as Tol Barad or Wintergrasp, no raid group is required to take part in the excitement, and the zone will cap out at approximately 100 players per side, opening the door to some truly epic-sized confrontations. To keep the action amped up, the same large group of regular realms will feed into the zone, so it’s likely you’ll run into some familiar faces whenever you visit, both friend and foe. There will be plenty of room to roam, as Ashran measures approximately the size of the Isle of Thunder. The intention is to provide as much of a true world PvP experience as we possibly can to those who choose to frequent the island. The odds may not always be in your favor, but with so many places to hunker down to either hide or lie in wait, there are plenty of opportunities to achieve whatever goals you’ve set forth for yourself.<br />
<br />
The Lay of the Land<br />
At each end of the island, separate from the conflict enveloping the isle, players will find a small sanctum of relative safety. Full-sized Horde and Alliance hubs sit behind each faction’s base, offering pretty much everything a regular city would.<br />
<br />
Ready to dive into the fray? One main artery runs through the center of the zone, and it’s here that you’ll engage in an endless faction tug-of-war. At opposite endpoints, Horde and Alliance bases wait to be captured, and you’ll be fighting for control of five additional capture points as you make your way down the lane. Capturing these points along the way will push you and your faction toward the enemy base, making it possible to take the battle all the way to the opposing faction’s base. To effectively hamstring your opponents and hobble their efforts for a time, you’ll just need to take down their General within their base. Doing so will not only garner you bragging rights, but will also deny the opposing faction access to their General, who serves as a Conquest vendor.<br />
<br />
At the central hub, the Ogre King stands waiting, flanked by his two bodyguards. Engaging one of the bodyguards and proving your worth in combat will win the Ogre King to your faction’s side, and he will fight for you for a time. But beware! His endurance is limited, and the longer he goes undefeated, the more susceptible to damage he becomes.<br />
<br />
As in many Battlegrounds, each faction will have a Resource count available to them. Once a faction’s Resources drop to 100, they’ll get a little extra help via a randomly spawning Captain who will begin to fight for their side. Many of these will bear familiar names such as Swifty, who will fight for the Alliance, or Talbadar, who will fight for the Horde. There’s no guarantee who will ultimately come to your aid, however. Each time a side reaches this Resource count, a new random captain will join the fray.<br />
<br />
Beyond the Tug-Of-War<br />
There’s more to Ashran than the conflict in the central lane. Around Ashran there are additional points of interest (POIs) and monsters to slay. The various POIs offer a variety of random events which will allow players to win awards for the Horde or Alliance. Buffs can also be earned by killing other players or NPCs. There are currently seven POIs set around the edges of Ashran—we’ll go into detail on each of these later on down the line.<br />
<br />
Righteous Rewards<br />
As you make your way around Ashran, you’ll be collecting currency from other players and from monsters you’ve slain. This currency can then be turned in at your base for additional bonuses for your faction, such as Mage Portals or a Warlock Gateway. Or you can choose to summon a random—and truly epic—NPC to join in the fight. You’ll want to take care, though, and plan your turn-ins accordingly. One losing encounter with a player of the opposite faction can strip you of your hard-fought treasure and have it wind up in their pockets instead.<br />
<br />
You’ll also be able to collect zone-bound items (usable only on the island) to give yourself a little extra advantage as you take on the various challenges around Ashran.<br />
<br />
For those looking for the next step in gear, Ashran will provide access to Conquest-quality gear that is unavailable elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Building on lessons learned from the Timeless Isle and Alterac Valley, we want players who make their way to Ashran to always have something exciting to do, and to offer them a true world PvP experience. Whether your aim is to engage in PvP or take on the various points of interest, there’s bound to be something to get your adrenaline going.</div></div><hr />

I'm disappointed by it too but i'm starting to get over it - There just seems to be so much awesome with this expansion that I don't even care anymore :3 - OT, swifty as a NPC? :D What else are we going to get? Reckful? Hydra? Braindeadly? Just to name a few, this could be fun xD</div></div><hr />

Indeed. Did anyone yet expressed the problems that comes with city being connected directly into PvP zone. This is gonna end in rage wars on forums if we don't make developers change their minds and revert the main cities back to Karabor and Bladespire, like they were originally planned, while Beta is still up.<br />
<br />
Not saying this just because I want original capitols back, but because there's gonna be a lot of griefing if the sides are unbalanced.</div></div><hr />

Yea but Both the alliance and horde shrines are right next to each other and are much closer than the ones in Ashran. Also most cities, besides Shatt and Dalaran are attackable. So really nothing has changed nothing has changed in city design.</div></div><hr />

The actual cities are not part of the PvP. Their are separate bases for the actual pvp. So how could greifing take place considering the goal of the area is to take control of these points?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the litter the zone with PvE daily quests, possibly even obligatory quests for a new legendary whatnot and obligatory rep grind, and on top of that make it a pvp zone, it is just shit. PvP server up or down, when I finally get myself to grind and do that boring shit, I don't want to be jumped by groups of people where I don't have a fucking chance, and for PvP I do mostly arenas where skill actually partially maters, or battlegrounds for mindless fun, but I never do &quot;/say let's make a group and go fuck up this guy killing turtles that will be fun&quot; because that is not fun but retarded.</div></div><hr />

As per the dev backpedaling after the capital news broke, the Ashran stuff is 100% canon and the fighting there is backed by Vol'jin and Varian. One patch without the hackneyed faction war is apparently just too much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, the whole of Ashran is like a big CRZ; IIRC it tries to pull servers to get a closer faction balance (60/40? 55/45? or, god forbid, 50/50?), as opposed to a 90/10 one.<br />

All they'd have to do is call it a skirmish or some crap for now and it could be just fine. Both factions on the same island, both prepping for massive war vs. the Iron Horde, you want to keep yourselves on your toes.</div></div><hr />

Well, it's for he PvPers. What do you expect? They need some bogus reason to slaughter each other and they don't care about story.<br />

My Alliance server is Turaylon a pve server, and you could be getting ganked right in from of an alliance raid and they would not help you because they find it bothersome to flag and pvp which is fine. However, they all will go to Ashran and do dailys like Timeless isle and the horde will show up and they do pvp... A lot... And they will dominate all the alliance bases easily, the faction city hub will get taken, we will get farmed if we help and it will suck hard balls. My horde servers on the other hand will be fun because they're pvp servers and much ganking will be had.</div></div><hr />

Being pretty generous with 90%, I wouldn't have put it that low.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can choose to pvp in on the timeless isle? You play on a PVE server don't you? Because trust me friend, My butt and my daggers are proof that it is not consensual on the isle.</div></div><hr />

@all those in this thread who take a minute of their life to type 'I don't even like pvp', why are you even here? can you see why PvPers hate you?</div></div><hr />

And now what? Sorry, but the Story can go fuck itself. I know that sounds harsh but it's a Video Game. While having Story at all is a nice thing, GAMEPLAY should always outweigh the Story. Otherwise there wouldn't be anything to do for every PvP Player right now. You could say you don't care for PvP and those doing it, but then it again it will hit back like a truck: &quot;We don't care for your Story.. what now?&quot;.</div></div><hr />
