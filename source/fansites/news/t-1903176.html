Patch 6.2.3 - Fel Reaver Noises<br />
If you want to hear the Fel Reaver sound people are talking about (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1902202-Fel-Reaver-noises), just fly into Ashran and it will play when you are dismounted.<br />

[Hotfix in testing] Warlords Season 3 Combatant’s equipment (http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-green-text=34&amp;filter-search=Combatant) now has the same item level as Warlords Season 2 Gladiator’s equipment in both PvE and PvP.<br />
Some Season 3 Warmongering Insignia trinkets should no longer incorrectly trigger its effect immediately when equipped.<br />
Infallible Tracking Charm (http://www.wowdb.com/items/133597-infallible-tracking-charm) now has a massively increased damage and chance to trigger, but now only increases damage against demons for 5 seconds (down from 10 seconds.)<br />
Purified Shard of the Third Moon (http://www.wowdb.com/items/133598-purified-shard-of-the-third-moon) now creates a damage shield that absorbs 100% more damage on use.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Armory Stats - Challenge Modes<br />
Today we are taking a look at the Challenge Mode achievement completion rate of players. The data used today is a sample of 2.1 million characters active in the last two months. We also did this earlier this year, which you can see here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4803-Five-Player-Blast-Furnace-Normal-Armory-Stats-Challenge-Modes-Blue-Tweets-DLC). <br />
<br />
The first chart looks at the overall percentage of players that have each challenge mode achievement. The second chart defines a participating player as one with the completion achievement for that challenge mode. <br />
<br />
You can click the titles in the legend to turn off and on different data types.<br />
<br />
<br />
Challenge Warlord (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/8895-challenge-warlord) - 3.03% of players<br />
Challenge Warlord: Bronze (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/8897-challenge-warlord-bronze) - 2.87% of players / 94.52% of participating players<br />
Challenge Warlord: Silver (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/8898-challenge-warlord-silver) - 2.72% of players / 89.8% of participating players<br />
Challenge Warlord: Gold (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/8899-challenge-warlord-gold) - 2.49% of players / 81.92% of participating players<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
In Legion, are we still going to fill our bags with &quot;Tome of the Clear Mind&quot; in order to change our talents?<br />
Nope! No reagents are needed to swap talents in Legion. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/667064453842604032))<br />
<br />
with the inclusion of gnome hunters, does this mean we can expect other new race/class combos?<br />
We have no other additional race/class combos planned for Legion at this time. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666710588974723074))<br />
<br />
If base spells change for all classes, will learning order and speed we learn them change too?<br />
Yes, the levels at which you learn each ability will be adjusted. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666692148780122112))<br />
<br />
Is leveling to110 as restore shaman going to be just using lightning bolt since we have no maelstrom power?<br />
Nope! We're adding more engaging damage-dealing rotations for all healers in Legion. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666691889047842817))<br />
<br />
any plans on HP changes for Legion?<br />
HP pools turned out fairly well in Warlords. No wide-scale changes for Legion. Couple specs may go up or down. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666692647709339648))<br />
How is it acceptable to have one level 100 player with barely 200k hp, and another with well over 500k?<br />
What issue do you see there? There are different forms of content targeting those players. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/666702060319059969))<br />
<br />
Do Moonkins and Spriests keep their in-form healing in Legion? Clarification due to the &quot;no mana&quot;.<br />
They will have some healing. We're still determining exactly what. Moonkin still have mana, it just isn't used for damage. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666704648930127872))<br />

this makes me sad. The presences aren't &quot;just clutter&quot; they have utility with movement speed and BP has saved many wipes.<br />
There will still be ways to save wipes, and a variety of utility. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666692275989147648))<br />
<br />
Hey, could u explain Marrowrend? Does it automatically activate Bone Shield (working like SotR) or can we manually use stacks?<br />
Using Marrowrend gives you 3 stacks of Bone Shield, which work as they do now. Bone Shield isn't an active button of its own. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/667065604902285312))<br />

What will happen to Bloodtalons for Ferals? Will it remain a talent or something else?<br />
Bloodtalons works well as a high-risk, high-reward talent, and is remaining. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666700288573640706))<br />
<br />
So rejuvenate cant be used in feral.. Does this applies to all specs besides Resto &amp; as a feral what will be the way to heal?<br />
Still determining what heals can be used in forms. Ferals do still have the very strong Predatory Swiftness + Healing Touch. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666702844628631552))<br />
<br />
will the feral druid legendary overwrite the saberon appearance from the talent or will saberon appearance be customized too?<br />
We've opted to remove the Saberon form, for now. Artifacts provide a huge amount of customizability for forms. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666711461947813888))<br />
<br />
If feral or guardian druids transmog their artifacts, will their bear and cat form go back to basic, or be the form selected?<br />
It will remain as the artifact-based form. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/667065954631704576))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/272-Mage) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/mage) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#g))<br />
Run of Power &amp; Incanter's Flow. Can we please go into #Legion without these? Would mean an awful lot to many mages if removed.<br />
Rune of Power isn't for everyone, but pretty flexible nowadays. Incanter's Flow is a passive option for those who prefer it. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666705882546212864))<br />
<br />
will Ice Barrier be stronger in Legion for mages?<br />
It's hard to measure exactly, since so much changes between expansions, but in general terms, yes. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666706559594926080))<br />
<br />
Every other class can self heal, how does it appropriately fit with every other class fantasy except mages?<br />
Absorbs (such as Ice Barrier) fill the same role instead. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666709255760678912))<br />
Can do harder content with worse gear on classes that I don't know as well vs mage with absorb. Any plans to improve absorbs?<br />
Not every class is designed to be a master of sustainability. Mages are somewhere in the middle. Ice Barrier will be quite strong. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/667064697707888640))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/imonks.gif Monk (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/341-Monk) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/monk) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#o))<br />
SCK having a chi req.. so it's no longer spammable and can't be used without first selecting a target and generating a chi?<br />
We chose to turn SCK into a spender, so that its damage could be strong. It will not require a target. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666703255917846528))<br />
<br />
is Touch of Death staying around? it's pretty iconic to monks.<br />
Touch of Death is remaining, but it works rather differently. It's more of a cooldown than an execute. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666703945721483264))<br />
<br />
I need clarification on storm-earth-fire,Will us the main character deal 100% of the damage while both clone deal 50% damage?<br />
No. All three, including you, will deal 50% damage. It's not for use on one or two targets. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666706812251455488))<br />
<br />
will we see Chi Explosion in Legion in a new form now that chi is gone? It's one of my favorite spells!<br />
Chi Explosion disagreed with the fantasy quite a bit, and was extremely complex. Instead, we're adding other alternatives. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666706986348613632))<br />
<br />
With fistweaving gone how will mistweavers do damage?<br />
Mistweavers still have a few melee combat abilities for dealing damage. They just won't also cause healing. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666709092019236864))<br />
<br />
With their mastery changing, will Mistweaver monks still create healing spheres?<br />
There will be no more Healing Spheres as a baseline. We may add them as a PvP talent, however. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666709472971091971))<br />

Will paladins still have seals in Legion or are they a thing in the past?<br />
While they've been around forever, they haven't delivered on gameplay, so Seals will be a thing of the past. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666701090843312128))<br />
<br />
the changes to hammer of the righteous and consecration interaction effect single target damage whether consecration is down?<br />
Yes, they do. Consecration is still worth using, even on a single target. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666703800078495745))<br />
<br />
With holy gone for tankadins. What's replacing it? Mana?<br />
Gameplay-wise, Protection Paladins will treat uses of Shield of the Righteous similar to how they treated Holy Power. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/667063414091444224))<br />
They'll still have a mana bar, which is only used for healing others and utility. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/667063464058224640))<br />

Do Void- and Mind Blast share CD? Or can i enter Voidform with MB, and then cast VB immediately?<br />
We're still iterating on the Shadow rotation, and looking to further differentiate gameplay in/out of Voidform. Stay tuned. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666702577791209472))<br />

is shadow word: death gone for spreists? it was so important for pvp tbh, will be really sad if it is gone.<br />
Currently, it remains, as the only true execute ability (other than Execute). (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666703447463366657))<br />
<br />
With the Shadow Priest changes in Legion, will the way Clarity of Power be changing?<br />
The new rotation is significantly different, so most talents have to be rethought. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/667064883008045056))<br />

The positioning window stuff will be interesting. Is &quot;behind&quot; a 90 or 180 degree arc?<br />
Backstab is very generous. Anywhere in the rear 270 degrees counts (back and sides). (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666785842380181505))<br />
<br />
Shadowstrike... merging Ambush &amp; Shadowstep... Is Shadowstep gone in Legion? Favourite sub ability next to SDance.<br />
Shadowstrike is a merge between Ambush and Shadowstep, and replaces both. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/667056657063522305))<br />

is Charred Remains gone for Destruction warlocks? Please let it be gone!!And is there any hope for fel flame? Pls answer both<br />
Definitely gone. It turned out very un-fun. Many Warlock talents are changing, and we're looking forward to feedback on them! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666700685593833472))<br />
<br />
is anything being done to address affliction warlocks aoe dps issues?<br />
Yes. Multidotting will be strong again, and Seed will be strong, especially with a talent that allows AoE application of Seed. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666703640283901952))<br />
<br />
How will Soul Swap work in Legion, it's really bad in WoD. Perhaps no cost with a CD ??<br />
Soul Swap will not be returning. However, there's a new talent, Soul Effigy, that may interest you... (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666701366870433792))<br />
<br />
I noticed Rain of Fire isn't listed as an ability in the Destruction preview. Will it still exist in Legion?<br />
RoF and FnB overlapped too much in Warlords, which is why we hotfixed RoF out of the picture until we could revise. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666704973263040512))<br />
In Legion, RoF is the primary AoE, and FnB is a talent (which doesn't obsolete RoF). (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666705047644848128))<br />
<br />
What weapon-type is the demo warlock artifact?<br />
It's a very unique artifact. We're still determining exactly how it will work for e.g. transmogrification. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/667067733566074880))<br />

Do y'all know if Fury's new rage dump, Rampage, will have its duration scale with Haste like Fists of Fury?<br />
Haste will reduce the GCD of Rampage, along with other rotational abilities. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666701213589594112))<br />
<br />
In Legion, if I DS Fury &amp; Arms, will I be able to equip Arms Artifact as Fury &amp; Vice Versa or will the artifact itself change?<br />
Artifacts do not swap with your spec, and are only equippable by the appropriate spec. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666710816486350848))<br />

<br />
items containing multistrike will changes with Legion?Do we have to look for new equipment if we're multistrikebased spec?<br />
Multistrike will be replaced with other useful stats. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/667067870916968448))<br />
<br />

the unhotfix of the 2nd boss of grimrail intentional or getting rehotfixed for Cms?<br />
Unintended. We'll restore the pre-patch behavior. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/666804469984694272))<br />

PvP<br />

<br />
With the new PvP scaling system in #Legion will managing multiple characters finally be doable? @WarcraftDevs<br />
The fact that some players want to play many characters while others only want to play one is a very challenging design problem. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/667007905841831936))<br />

Here's some fun facts for those interested: <br />
The weapons are tiny and barely noticeable except for the Gun and Polearm.<br />
After you complete the Challenge modes, you will not be awarded anything, you will have to visit the vendor and spend 1k gold on each weapon you want to buy.<br />
Legion will come with artifact weapons as soon as you start leveling. Do you really want to transmog those to this?</div></div><hr />

Well considering that one or two percent of the player base most likely runs them (without the paying people). It is not hard to believe that someone would know nothing about them. Very few people bother to read the patch notes from patch to patch or expansion to expansion. They just log into the game and ask questions in trade constantly. It is amazing the amount of people that play this game, yet they don't zero effort to inform themselves about the game.</div></div><hr />

They do not do a very good job of informing customers about these new features and if you are not in a strong guild, it is very difficult to get into a challenge mode group, certainly harder than a LFG heroic or raid wing. I come to this site every day but do not have a clear understanding of exactly how to do a challenge mode dungeon or how i would go about doing that since my guild is dead and i do not have a normal archimonde kill yet. My open raid group is making progress on him though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On average a little under 3% of total players have gotten gold in every dungeon so that's a baseline of carrys. Obviously not everyone who got gold paid for it, but it's safe to assume no one's paying for just a bronze carry (I don't even see people selling less than gold TBH). I'd wager it's a far smaller percentage than it was in MoP just bc the weapons aren't as desirable compared to the sets. Ofc this is from now.. perhaps there will be a spike when people have nothing better to blow their gold on for 10 months.<br />
<br />
The 'just completed' stat does show that there are a non-trivial amount of people interested in them, at least back in the early days when you could get decent gear from the daily quest. Hell it blows Mythic Raiding completely out of the water in terms of participation.</div></div><hr />

I feel ya but they do the same to PvP.. My Arcane Mage was awesome until they brought out Arcane Charges in MoP for PvE..

The charts seem to indicate that the majority of the players dont do challenge modes, which is also indicated by the poll results.

1.) MMO-Champion skews hardcore which is shown by gold being the next highest behind those who don't do challenge modes at all and those who get untimed are the lowest.<br />
2.) MMO-Champion is full of a bunch of liars who lie even in anonymous polls just to make their epeen feel bigger even though no one else will know what they voted for unless they brag about it in the comments. But bragging doesn't mean much and can just be taken as someone trying to boost their epeen.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I'd bet on a mix of the two.<br />
<br />
With 2.1 million players:<br />
3.03% have done challenge modes. That's 63,630 players.<br />
2.87% have done at least bronze. That's 60,270 (leaving 3,360 who have only done challenge modes untimed).<br />
2.72% have done silver. That's 57,120 (leaving only 3,150 who have only done bronze).<br />
2.49% have done gold. That's 52,290 (leaving 4,830 who have only done silver).<br />
<br />
Now according to MMO-Champion (as of this post 26,596 have voted)<br />
10,614 players have at least done challenge modes.<br />
1,044 have done bronze (which is nearly half of 3,360).<br />
1,619 have done silver (a bit less than half of 4,830).<br />
7,242 have done gold (nearly 1/7th of 52,290).<br />
<br />
So I guess we're lead to believe that about a seventh of the gold challenge mode population posts on these forums and voted in the poll. I'd say we have a bunch of liars mixed in with those telling the truth. Also rather curious that the site seems to have about half of the bronze and silver challenge mode players also that come here.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't take the poll seriously. I'd be more inclined to believe Chaud's graph and chalk the poll up to the hot air that often comes from many of the posters here. Certainly goes to show that people here are NOT the majority and any opinions here should be taken with a grain of salt.<br />
<br />
Looking at the number of gold players begs the question how many were bought and how many are legitimate.<br />
<br />
I'd be curious to see a comparison between those that completed MoP challenge modes vs WoD. Did participation go up or down? With so few partaking in it, I have to really question Blizzard building part of Legion's end game around them.</div></div><hr />

Yep. It's nice to see that in plain statistics as proof!</div></div><hr />

There is almost nothing left of the original vanilla paladin &quot;fantasy&quot;:<br />
<br />
- No auras<br />
- Simplified stripped-down blessings with no reagents<br />
- No seals<br />
- Holy power<br />
- No different judgments<br />
- No mount quest<br />
- No HoW</div></div><hr />

This time about Rune of Power/Incanter's Flow. To me, that response says &quot;we know RoP is terrible, but we can't think of anything suitable to replace it, so we're going to say it's just not for you. Pick the boring passive if you want to.&quot;<br />
Their bit about Mages and soloing old content is also bullshit, but I suppose it's an acceptable trade-off for the class that has pretty much never sucked in actual current content.<br />
<br />
Only ever did one challenge mode, Auchindoun, near the beginning of the expansion. Did it with some guildmates just for fun; had never done CM before since I didn't play a whole lot during MoP. It took us like an hour and 20 minutes to finish since we were just going at it casually. It's just not the type of game mode that I enjoy. Having to use cheese strats to beat timers is not something I want to do. (I know you don't have to do that, but it's the easiest way.) I may have cared more had the rewards been similar to the ones in MoP. The armor sets were awesome; the weapon rewards in WoD are incredibly underwhelming in comparison, IMO.</div></div><hr />
