PvP Brawls - Deepwind Dunk<br />
Can you even dunk? If you want to win this brawl, you’re going to need to work on your skills because Dunkball has come to Pandaria. You’ll race to claim balls from the map’s center, or northern, or southern mines, take them to your enemy’s base, and then go for a magnificent long range shot or go all in for the dunk.<br />

They drop pretty often, I seen a few pieces so far, but i mean it's no different than being in a group of 40 people, where only 5 of them get loot. You are just on the short end of the stick. It's not supposed to be high drop rate because well it's welfare loot, if you want 930's more reliably, go do mythics...if you can't be bothered to do that, then you don't need 930 loot to begin with :)</div></div><hr />

WoW has been like that for 13 years. At least this time with bosses you get something rather than nothing.</div></div><hr />

Well..I did the Broken Shore world boss 3 days ago with 8 characters, all of them with bonus roll...got 1! item....rng or not (sorry i don`t believe in blizz rng) it`s pretty bad....16 try and 1 good result....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Took coin rolls, but I got a 935 from the 1st boss up and a 930 from this week. That was on 1 character, while the other 3 I did it on all got AP. Sadly, those are the ones that would benefit from the gear more than the character I got it on. Seems pretty RNG to me, you know, how world bosses have always been and the new buzzword for everything Legion.</div></div><hr />

I'm 2 for 2 so far, both bosses on the previous weeks dropped loot.<br />

Looks like the Void is going after their Boys corpses. Bet there will be something similar for Ulduar too. And maybe something around where we killed Deathwing and where the heart was left post Seige of Orgrimmar.</div></div><hr />
