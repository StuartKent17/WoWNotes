Patch 6.2 - Corrupted Dreadwing<br />
If you have 150,000 Apexis Crystal (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/823-apexis-crystal) to spare, you can buy the Corrupted Dreadwing (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/123974-reins-of-the-corrupted-dreadwing) mount being added in Patch 6.2.<br />

Patch 6.2 - Frostwolf Set Helm<br />
Many people asked about the lack of a helm on the Frostwolf set (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/may/FrostwolfSet.jpg) from the latest PTR build (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4918-Patch-6-2-PTR-Build-20061-Upcoming-Raid-Testing-BlizzCon-Contests).<br />

<br />
<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
Art<br />
If all feedback is considered does that mean my spam of troll male tweets &amp; threads like this is read? http://t.co/0NdansqPkD<br />
Yep, everything is read even if it's not possible to respond to it all. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/601799083959984130))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
What about legendary weapons in timewalking dungeons? May i use Shadowmourne in a LK timewalking dungeon?<br />
Yes, you can. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/601846823288840192))<br />
<br />
Are tier tokens going to drop from bosses the way they been for past few tiers, or vanila class based tiers?<br />
Yes. Tokens are an uninteresting dungeon journal entry and do not drop in Personal loot, so we show the set items. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/601847129871527936))<br />
<br />
How good is the chance of seeing our attuned stats guaranteed on tier gear similar to how primary stats change based on spec?<br />
No plans for that at this time. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/601848809816084480))<br />
<br />
if we use a Seal on the final dungeon boss would that give us an extra chance at 700 ilvl drop?<br />
You have this chance on any boss and any bonus roll in Mythic dungeons. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/601849753798725632))<br />
<br />
Any plans on making BRF/HM bosses do less damage and have less health, in patch 6.2, like we had in Mists of Pandaria Raids?<br />
Yes, there will be a zone-wide debuff on Foundry/Highmaul enemies, like we did to Throne of Thunder in 5.4. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/601852892731944961))<br />
<br />
Are Highmaul+BRF Mythic going Cross-Realm with 6.2 as well?<br />
Yes. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/601852503894790144))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Not sure if you've noticed it, but CRZ turned Halaa into a 24/7 faction-based Gurubashi. Captures the spontaneity of world PvP.<br />
Yep, noticed it the moment I got the Halaa currency garrison mission and went out there to (try to) finally buy my mount.... (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/601538058123608066))<br />
<br />
Are there going to be WoD s2 equivalents to Ashran gear?<br />
The items that are comparable to ones that previously required Ashran rep are earned in a different way in season 17. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/601849451892723712))<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
While the developers have been pretty quiet since @WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/with_replies) appeared, Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Classes<br />
What was your take on Wotlk Ret? personally I enjoyed it alot even if it was simple. Right now Ret feels torn in directions<br />
I understand not everyone liked it, but our goal was to improve the class. Long term, rotations with mastery are more satisfying. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599575116134002690))<br />
MoP and WoD not so much. I feel like the fillers in cata (judge, CS and exo) had something uniqe to eachother.<br />
Ideally a rotation should deliver both mastery and satisfaction. Not sure we ever matched the satisfaction of the Wrath design. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599975263921840128))<br />
<br />
Like it or not, you contributed to that with your glib attitude towards some classes, most notably Paladins.<br />
I invested a great deal of energy in making paladins fun. I am quite sarcastic and that was often misinterpreted. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599976990066618369))<br />
The TO THR GROUND meme happened when I had to make a post on vacation to explain a nerf players weren't expecting. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599977385149079552))<br />
All the other teasing I did because players thought it was funny and memorable. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599977550769598465))<br />
Let's recall what paladins did in BC - they healed and maybe they tanked a boss or two, usually in dungeons. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599977843628486658))<br />
Paladins, druid and hunters swapped spots for most played, and paladins were definitely the most vocal, magnifying the issue. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599978094875648000))<br />
Maybe you weren't satisfied with our results, and I'm fine with that, but we were never glib about anyone's class. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599978306226638849))<br />
<br />
wow question, forgive me 8). You once said Pandas reduced faction diversity, What did you think of high elf for alliance?<br />
What is more important: faction identity or more options for Alliance? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/600373826501783552))<br />
<br />
When rotations are easy to execute it's unfair to make them competitive in performance with those that require more mastery. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599574604999331840))<br />
Holy Power was an attempt to have paladins manage a resource, not cooldowns, and mana felt like the wrong resource. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599574847996362755))<br />
I think it's also possible we went so far under my watch in preventing niche DPS that nobody felt special. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599590591291199490))<br />
<br />
Hybrid specs can have niches, but pure DPS should be more more than a niche.<br />
Nobody notices if 2nd dude is only slightly above 3rd dude. Nobody talks about which phase if the hard one. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599594322997092354))<br />
<br />
Yeah the interplay between single-spec-per-role and multi-spec-per-role dps complicates things immensely.<br />
Yeah, and I've said before that easy spec swapping helps the guys who can fill two roles a lot. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599593673777512448))<br />
This makes sense but then a rogue with more defined niches has to play multiple specs to be as effective.<br />
The dream is that everyone has a chance to shine, but that leads to some constrained encounter design. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599595111777832960))<br />
&quot;Hey guys, where is the Frost DK encounter in this 6 boss raid?&quot; (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599595209219936256))<br />
<br />
Right. There is a difference between wanting BF rogues for a fight, and wanting BF rogues only for that fight. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599592757322063874))<br />
And it sounds like the current design is that it's okay for stacking in mythic raiding, which makes sense to me. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599592872996769792))<br />
What we wanted to avoid was the guild of friends where you tell a weekend WoW player that he needs to reroll DK etc. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599593062331908097))<br />

Wildstar - Free to Play in Fall 2015<br />
After failing to grow or sustain subscribers (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4889-Solo-Rukhmar-Kills-Blue-Tweets-Latin-America-Price-Changes-Grommash-Cosplay), Wildstar is moving to a free to play model this fall. <br />
<br />
<br />
Existing players will get some nice cosmetic rewards (http://www.wildstar-online.com/en/news/2015-05-28-player-appreciation-rewards/) and Loyalty Points. <br />
Loyalty points will be used to gain Loyalty ranks to earn special items and perks.<br />
All current content is open to free players, but there may be paid content in the future.<br />
Free players will have less character slots, costumer slots, bank slots, and a lower decor items limit.<br />
Free players also have other restrictions on their account, such as limited Auction House and Commodities Exchange access, no priority access to customer support, no crafting or currency bonuses, no gathering bonus, no PTR access, no queue priority, no reputation bonus, no experience bonuses, and other restrictions. <br />
Signature players who pay for a subscription will not have any of those new restrictions. <br />
Free to play players can remove some of the restrictions with the Loyalty system.<br />
A currency for the store will drop (http://www.mmorpg.com/gamelist.cfm/game/632/feature/9725/Guess-What-WildStar-is-Going-Free-to-Play.html/page/1) from mobs in game, so even free players can eventually purchase things from the store.<br />

It has a lot going for it now that a lot of content was released over the past year. It fixed a lot of the bugs and optimization issues from last year, and eased up on trying to cater to purely hardcore players. I dare say that if this version of the game released last year, this game would have been as popular as FFXIV is now.<br />

<br />
...leap I think you meant to say.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I find it hilarious that they keep adding flying mounts to the game when they don't care about flying. I'm 100% FOR flying (Heck, my old nickname used to be Fly because I loved flying in this game so much), but if you aren't going to allow it in one zone, completely do away with it.<br />
<br />
It makes no sense to have flying in one place and yet not another. How can anyone even explain it away other than &quot;Um, we don't want you to fly because of game mechanics and stuff, oh and ... it'll let you see how small the world really is...&quot;<br />
<br />
Every time I see stuff like this it pisses me off.<br />

Some days I think DEVS do this just because they love the yummy taste of my tears. :~(<br />

<br />
Yes, they actually have Jay Wilson working on WoW again for the first time in a long time. Which makes it all the more amusing that the current WoW team is acting like the pre-RoS/pre-revamp/pre-Wilson-being-removed Diablo 3 team.</div></div><hr />

It is pretty easy to get that amount. A Spirit Lodge takes most of the work, if not all of it, out of getting crystals. Take 30 minutes and get some stones and a few weeks later gets you to the cap right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Take this slap in the face, pretty please, customers !<br />
<br />
Because you can still use it in other places.<br />
<br />
I'm more surprised by them using a collectors edition model when in the past they have been quite adamant on not reusing store/CE models, although they should have done it more by allowing us to get another Rylak (even if it didn't have all that armor and the jets on it so it could have been just a plain rylak with a saddle) and maybe a non-flying yellow Ravager mount would have been cool from the Laughing Skull.<br />
<br />
The mount problem this time is that us getting so many of the boars. Now I know we got a fuck load of cloud serpents in MoP, but they looked cool and the boar's model is average and their run animation is awful. We should have been getting a bunch of cool wolves, between seeing fel, fire, and purple ones we should have been seeing those more than the boars.<br />
<br />
Just because there may or may not be flying doesn't mean they can't keep making them. It gives them more models and different creatures to use so collectors can keep collecting cool looking mounts.</div></div><hr />

Considering people will have apexis coming out the ears from Tanaan... and if you get a mage tower it practically pukes ~1.2k Apexis a day for such little effort. &quot;VERY SMALL percentage&quot;? I think not. And it's not like there aren't flying areas that exist.</div></div><hr />

Not 150 days. The spirit lodge gives you a few k apexis per day.<br />
<br />
Garrison missions give about 1-2k per day.<br />
<br />
You can do the apexis crystal missions unlimitedly if you have enough garrison resources.<br />

Starting from scratch with some effort, it will take you 10-20 days. If you go hardcore you can do it in a week.</div></div><hr />

For the felraven, nobody froces you to farm apexis, and think about this : it's juste a recolor of an existing mount, and one some don't own yet because they didn't buy the digital collector. So instead of colmplaining about a flying mount within a no-fly expansion, complain about the way Blizz screwed ppl with making a traditionnaly unique model non-unique.<br />

What's wrong with you? it's an adaptable mount. Yes, you won't be able to fly in Draenor but you can still use the mount and by having the ability to fly means that you can still use the mount for the old content too.

You are completely missing the point. This is a flying mount model when Blizz has announced that future expansions won't have flying. Yes, it can run on the ground but it is a flying mount. Implementing this mount now shows that they not only disregard the players but they also disregard their own game.</div></div><hr />

I can farm apexis crystals ( a shit-ton of them) hours on end doing some of the most pointless &quot;dailies&quot; ever implemented so that I can buy a mount that I cannot use properly b/c the developers never want me to fly in this game again???!!!!!!!<br />

I have to agree with this. Wildstar is an abject joke of a game and NCSOFT is pathetically horrid at customer service. As an example, they'll ban you for simple customer service interactions, like a refund. If a lot of you think Blizzard is bad with customer service, you haven't experienced the cesspool that the rest of the MMO industry is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a Tweeter from him about that:<br />
https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/604339544251465728<br />
<br />
He was the greatest hero of WoW up the end of WotLK, because at this time not only him, but few other developers could come to the boards and discuss stuff, like they were players too.<br />
Feedback was awesome, understanding was great, and work flow was fast.<br />
<br />
Them came Cataclysm and Devs stopped to use the boards. A new generation of moderators appeared and abused their power, FREELY, sooner or later contaminating the OLD moderation.<br />
<br />
By Pandaria was consensus that &quot;the community reached the status of Toxic&quot;, like it wasn't Blizzard's fault for cutting our communication channel and puts us on the dark. Ghostcrawler got A KIND of victory convincing to be allowed to a Developer Watercooler blog. Wasn't enough. He only had his twitter, that because of the lack of space did more damage than help to his communications.<br />
<br />
Still, at Pandaria looks like there WERE developers willing to hear players, still leading. Now we're back to the Cataclysm Launch style of Leading Devs that &quot;born with ALL THE ANSWERS, and don't need to hear customers, because they always know best&quot;.<br />

Your argument is that people shouldn't be pissed, because they can only get use from it's design on irrelevant content? Of course people see that it CAN still work as a ground mount, but it is a FLYING mount. <br />
