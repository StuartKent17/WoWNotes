Retribution paladins<br />
We have mentioned in the past that we would like to improve Retribution Paladins in Wrath of the Lich King, we just don't have a lot of specific details to release regarding this right now. We did say we plan on changing how their abilities work to share gear with warriors which will help make it easier for them to gear up though.

<br />
Dagger rogues<br />
We understand that daggers need a bit of improvement and plan to improve them. Currently though there are other options for doing damage for the Rogue so it is not like all options are blocked, but like I said, we are aware of this issue.

Classes changes before the expansion<br />
We currently don't have any plans to make big changes to any class before Wrath of the Lich King. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=5687439613&amp;postId=57837281838&amp;sid=1#64))<br />

Hunter - Charge affecting Growl is a bug<br />
Sad news for all the hunters using a boar in solo PvE, your pet will be nerfed in a future patch. <br />
I have confirmed with the developers that Boar's growl ability getting such a large bonus to attack power based on charge is a bug. Growl should only benefit from the hunter's attack power and get no benefit from buffs to the pet's attack power.<br />
<br />
Expect this to be changed in a future patch. If you disagree with this change please post about it in the suggestions or class forums (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/board.html?forumId=11122&amp;sid=1).<br />

Arena tournament Q&amp;A<br />
Bornakk answered a lot of questions related to the Arena Tournament on the official forums. <br />
Why are the +15 Agility to gloves and the +24 AP to bracers enchantments not available ?<br />
We were adding in as many enchants and items as possible based on what arena players were using and what players who helped test the Tournament system requested, we must have missed these. We’re currently looking to see if we can get these added in, but currently it doesn’t look like they’ll make it into the Tournament. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=5780938333&amp;postId=57803482805&amp;sid=1#1))<br />
<br />
The tournament details mentioned world pvp, and so far you cant kill an opposite faction at all. Is this coming?<br />
We did remove the note that mentioned World PvP when it was decided to take it out. World PvP requires a lot of players to be in the same area at the same time which would lead people away from the Arenas and we want to keep people focused on the Arena games. The more people queuing up the better for everybody really. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=5754286222&amp;postId=57836784215&amp;sid=1#5))<br />
<br />
Why are 2v2 and 5v5 games available on the Tournament Realm ?<br />
The 2v2 and 5v5 games are still offered as we want to provide players with more options to enjoy while playing on the Tournament realms. If you have extra friends that are online (or fewer) you can play the other games and still battle your heart or even try some new things for fun. We will continue to monitor the queues and make changes as we are able to though (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=5720153154&amp;postId=57836784097&amp;sid=1#51))<br />
<br />
When will all ratings reset to 1500 (end of the practice period) ?<br />
The practice period will end on Tuesday, April 22, 2008 when the servers go down for maintenance and at this time, all teams will be reset to 1500 rating. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=5754407237&amp;postId=57836784489&amp;sid=1#2))<br />
<br />
When do we need 200 games by?<br />
The 200 games must be played by the end of the first qualifier which is scheduled to conclude on Tuesday, May 20, 2008 when the servers go down for maintenance. Players will have 4 weeks to play the 200 games that count toward their final rating. The same length of time will apply to the second qualification round though the dates for the second qualification will obviously be different.

If i have 3 characters, Am I allowed to play with 3 groups ? One group for each character?<br />
If you have three characters you can be on three different teams, however, you will only be eligible to qualify for the regionals with one team. If you happen to have two teams that qualify, you will have to pick one to play. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=5784268590&amp;postId=57836784357&amp;sid=1#1))<br />
<br />
When will we be kicked out of the tournament if we don't have enough games or a high enough rating?<br />
Tuesday, May 20, 2008 is when the first round of qualification completes. You will have to re-register to continue to take part in the Tournament Realm past this date. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=5754407237&amp;postId=57836784489&amp;sid=1#2))<br />
<br />
Do I need to have my group formed at the end of the period of practice?<br />
It is best to have your team formed and ready at the end of the practice period and before Phase 2 of the Tournament begins (which is when actual rankings begin) because your team will lose 150 rating for each team member added during this phase. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=5784268590&amp;postId=57836784357&amp;sid=1#1))<br />
<br />
Approximately what rating is needed to advance to Stage 2?<br />
There is no numerical value we can attach to this question right now. It depends on how well players do and where they are at when the four week period finishes. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=5754407237&amp;postId=57836784489&amp;sid=1#2))<br />

50 Characters limit and Arena Tournament Realm<br />
Keep in mind the 50 characters per account restriction still applies to the new Tournament Realms. You will want to check your total and possibly delete a single character and see if you can then create a new one on the Tournament Realm of your choice.

How about they give Holy some recognition as being the weakest healer and buff that instead.<br />

Does the changes to daggers mean itemization changes to the daggers, or changes to dagger specs for Rogues? Is Mutilate no longer a good spec? o_o</div></div><hr />

I don't know if it really matters, though; the stats should be the same.</div></div><hr />
