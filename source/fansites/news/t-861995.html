Disclaimer<br />
This is not an official preview, the whole post could just be speculation going wrong. There is definitely a lot of data available and it's definitely enough to assume that this is indeed the legendary staff but unless you hear it from a blue poster, anything I post could be a giant lie. <br />
<br />
In any case, nothing is official, nothing is final, this is just data from a test server.<br />
<br />
<br />
Weapon Model<br />
The staff has 3 models and we can assume that it will be upgraded through multiple quests/events like Shadowmourne. The upgraded is much more visible than with Shadowmourne and it looks like you will even add parts to your staff at some point.<br />

<br />
Quests<br />
A couple of quests added in the patch seems to be related to the staff. Most importantly, it seems that the questline is heavily tied to the Keepers of Time. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Anachronos will apparently show you the future of Azeroth<br />
You will have to collect Living Ember (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/69237/living-ember/) and spend 9000 Gold on 3 x Sands of Time (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/65893/sands-of-time/) to rebuild the &quot;Eye&quot;. We assume that Living Ember (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/69237/living-ember/) is the new Primordial Saronite (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49908/primordial-saronite/) and the &quot;Eye&quot; is Timeless Eye (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/69238/timeless-eye/) datamined in this patch.<br />
The track of information ends with the quest started after you rebuild the Timeless Eye (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/69238/timeless-eye/).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A Legendary Engagement (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/29129/a-legendary-engagement/) / A Legendary Engagement (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/29132/a-legendary-engagement/)<br />
Objective - Speak to Anachronos in the Caverns of Time.<br />
Description - I expected that I would find you here, &lt;class&gt;. But then, we of the bronze flight have somewhat of an advantage when it comes to such things.<br />
<br />
*Coridormi smiles.*<br />
<br />
For reasons unknown to me, my master seeks audience with you. I would counsel you not to take this invitation lightly, &lt;name&gt;. Anachronos seldom has cause to interact with mortals. Wisdom would dictate that you seek him out in the Caverns of Time at once. <br />
<br />
Speak to me when you are ready and I shall personally deliver you.<br />
<br />
<br />
A Wrinkle in Time (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/29134/a-wrinkle-in-time/)<br />
Objective - Speak to Anachronos in the Caverns of Time to witness the future of Azeroth.<br />
Description - Listen carefully, &lt;class&gt;, for though we are only beginning, time already grows short and the consequences of our failure are unfathomable. An event in the recent past has been obscured from my vision by the most powerful of magics. Its impact, however, has not. <br />
<br />
If action is not taken to change the course of this timeline's future, the outcome is clear. Brace yourself, mortal, and behold the future of Azeroth.<br />
<br />
<br />
All-Seeing Eye (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/29135/all-seeing-eye/)<br />
Objective - Collect 25 Living Embers (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/69237/living-ember/) from Firelands and 3 Sands of Time (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/65893/sands-of-time/).<br />
Description - I perceive the questions that burn within your mind and I must confess that I share in your uncertainty... a rare position for one such as I, and a most unsettling one. As I scour time to find traces of this obscured event, you must aid me in the creation of an Eye, both to test your worthiness, and to provide an essential tool in the unraveling of this mystery. <br />
<br />
Venture into the Plane of Fire, &lt;class&gt;, and gather Living Embers. Bring them to me with Sands of Time and I will create the Eye.<br />
<br />
<br />
On a Wing and a Prayer (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/29193/on-a-wing-and-a-prayer/)<br />
Objective - Bring the Timeless Eye to Coldarra.<br />
Description - Time well spent, mortal. <br />
<br />
While you were struggling in the Plane of Fire, my watchers and I were able to determine where and, most importantly, when our vision was obscured. We have discovered that the shroud was placed over the Nexus, far to the north in the realm of the blue dragonflight. <br />
<br />
I have attuned the Timeless Eye (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/69238/timeless-eye/) to show you the occurrences that remain hidden to us here. Go at once to Coldarra and search out a place suitable for the Eye's activation. <br />
<br />
Travel well, friend.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Flaming splinters are listed as being part of the staff yet no quest currently in boubs post mentions them.<br />
<br />
Assumedly this would be the same as shadowfrost shards or the splinters from Atiesh. That is to say they drop from raid bosses.<br />
25-50% chance on normal mode<br />
50-75% on heroic mode.<br />
<br />
Or whatever the drop rate was for shadowfrost shards.<br />
<br />
Pretty sure Atiesh's splinters were 100% droprate. (wasn't around in vanilla.)</div></div><hr />

Hm a simple questline like that would require us to spend 9k gold + possible ~100-200k gold for the Ambers? I dont think that could be true. Or am i misunderstanding your post?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Speculation: No, it's the Legendary quest chain. You spend a huge amount of money and time and whatever else and get a legendary.<br />
<br />
However, it's probably like the TBC stuff at the same time - you are going into the Firelands to introduce you to the Caverns of Time storyline for a future raid. The quests are almost assuredly referring to the War of the Ancients.<br />
<br />
I'll be very surprised if those &quot;visions&quot; are not about the War of the Ancients in one way or another, and then we'll see it in the patch after the Firelands, probably.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edited to show speculation and for other things.</div></div><hr />

Well, if they intend it to be a DPS staff only they should just add a proc on damage modifier, if not, by then, I think spirit will be of lesser value then it is currently, and it might be good for both roles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty easy to sort that out. Your offensive spells have chance to.....<br />
<br />
Since other than the occasional smite or sa similar ability to generate a bit of mana, most healers won;t be using offensive spells.<br />
<br />
That or put hit on it. Pretty sure healers don't need hit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, it's like the TBC stuff at the same time - you are going into the Firelands to introduce you to the Caverns of Time storyline for a future raid. The quests are almost assuredly referring to the War of the Ancients.<br />
<br />
I'll be VERY surprised if those &quot;visions&quot; are not about the War of the Ancients in one way or another, and then we'll see it in the patch after the Firelands, probably.<br />
<br />
The quests reference the recent past. While yes recent can mean a long time to dragons that guard time itself. Also it references the event that is shrouded having taken place at the nexus. The nexus is related to the blue dragonflight, and no blues were previously known to be major players in the war of the ancients. Except for of course the forging of the demon/dragon soul. The only thing in the quests that could be refering to the war of the ancients is the fact it has to do with Keepers of time, and the fact that it takes you to a spot that is related to the blue dragon flight.<br />
<br />
Given the fact that it is steps taking place in the firelands raid, it is likely something that relates to the return of ragnoros instead of the war of the ancients. Blizzard wouldn't be so stupid as to create a legendary that has more to do with the next tier of content then the one you have to spend time doing just to experience the legendary quest chain.<br />
<br />
Also it is hardly &quot;spend a huge amount of money and get a legendary&quot; since there is just as much collect steps as shadowmourne.</div></div><hr />

It's still a very valid point - a staff created from a quest related to time problems from the bronze dragonflight in an expansion where we were told we were getting a Caverns of Time raid when the last legendary staff also had more lore tie-ins with its followup raid (Naxx - Kara)?<br />
<br />
It's at least possible and is very suspicious, especially in an expansion will so many Vanilla lore themes - they could definitely try the same legendary trick.<br />

<br />
Its also possible it has to do with 5.0 and the infinite dragonflight gaining control of all the ley lines. Anything is possible with speculation, but some are more plausible. There is nothing tying it to being War of the Ancients related other then the fact that it involves Keeper of time and War of the ancients was annouced as a raid for Cataclysm. Firelands, or the plane of fire, has no known ties to the war of the ancients. The blue dragonflight (the nexus) only tie in is their involvement with the demon soul. <br />
<br />
Might as well say that it has to do with the final encouter with deathwing because we know we will fight him this expansion and it has to do with with recent past, which the twilight hammer and deathwings breaking out is recent past, has to do with events at the nexus (it was said all dragonflights are needed, so anything impeding the new blue aspect or the ley lines would aid deathwing).<br />
<br />
You seem to be holding a strong conviction that it is related to war of the ancients when there is nothing that indicates that other then pure speculation with very little to indicate such. Given that the focus of 4.1 known so far is the Plane of Fire and Trolls having the war of the ancients this content patch is slim. Yes there will be breadcrumb lore, but the idea that an entire raid is being used as a introduction for the War of the ancients is a bit of a stretch. Since that is what you are suggesting since all of the currently known lore/steps of the legendary involves FireLands. It would be like building shadowmourne from Ulduar when Ulduar has little ties to ICC (Only real tie was yogg-saron's visions and saronite being the blood of yogg-saron)<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
Then technically none of the quests have been added yet so its not even a major gold sink. And if you weren't trying to talk about the difficulty why did you comment on it? Don't make the comment if you don't want people to discuss it. Besides a legendary that only requires vast sums of gold is bad in more ways then one that even making the comment offhand is ludicrous. Blizzard wouldn't add an item that encourages people to go out and buy gold or allow that much power to just by simply buying gold.</div></div><hr />

No, you misunderstand - two posters were confused with what I said (which wasn't said well), they thought I was saying this wasn't a legendary quest 'only' an optional lore quest. I was just trying to clarify to them I wasn't thinking that.<br />

It will be like the current Cataclysm in-game cinematics, like the Uldum intro cinematic and Bastion of Twilight Eye cinematic and others.<br />

The data is in the PTR files, but it isn't something that can be viewed through datamining I don't think. I'm pretty sure the server controls the mob spawns.</div></div><hr />

Healers had a legendary in WoTLK (Ulduar), DPS casters have had nothing since Vanilla. Also the effect that distinguishes it from epics will most likely be beneficial to DPS only.<br />
HOPEFULLY it will be similar to something like &quot;Chance on harmful spellcast to give you 75 additional SP, upto 10 stacks. At 10 stacks it gives the caster 750 haste for 15 seconds and consumes the stacks on SP&quot; (very similar to what Shadowmourne did, well kinda :p).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would imagine it would be restricted to DPS casters. So Mages, Warlocks, Priests, Druids and Shaman should have the option to get it, I guess. Since it seems to be upgradable and part of a quest chain there would not really be any reason to restrict it.<br />

The Living Embers are most likely going to be the &quot;Primordial Saronites&quot; this time around, so it's 9k plus 25X however much they cost. I doubt it will work out cheaper.</div></div><hr />

Some people complaining about lolquestline to get the legendary, but I prefer that over 'Grind this instance every lockout, and you might get it before it becomes obsolete and only functions as a vanity item.'<br />

except thist ime it has 3 stages instead of 2<br />

first stage will be IL of normal mode weapons<br />
stage 2 will be IL of heroic mode weapons<br />
then third stage will be T12 heroic IL<br />

It'll probably be a cutscene of the end of the world.<br />
<br />
If it had anything to do with the history of War of the Ancients at risk of being altered, the shroud would've been over part of the Caverns of Time itself, not over the Nexus in Coldarra, where the next quest in the breadcrumb chain leads the player. Signs point stronger to this having to do with Malygos' demise as this is the most significant event in the &quot;recent past&quot; that occurred in the region of interest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I assume you mean next expansion, b/c healers were using Val'anyr throughout the entire WotLK.<br />
<br />
<br />
Even though I agree that 9k gold is not that much. (Vial goes for 65k on my server) I still don't like this direction that blizzard is taking by making everything into a huge gold dump. Yeah of course there will be some crazy thing that im sure will need to be done (Shadowmourne attunements) but still...<br />
<br />
I would agree with this. While Shadowmorne took forever to collect the shards if your guild wasn't doing heroic modes, by the end of wrath, every halfway decent 25 man guild had 3-4 of these. <br />
<br />
If blizzard has any sort of sense, they will make sure to have a damaging spells proc that does not appeal to healers. They had their chance with Val'anyr, and don't need another legendary the very next expansion. Why can't all classes use it? Because it's a LEGENDARY. I do feel for feral druids and enhancement shammys, they've gotten the shaft for a while. Sadly I doubt that an agi weapon will be the other legendary, as both legendaries in BC were agi weapons. It'll probably be a tanking weapon.</div></div><hr />

Spirit or no spirit. It can be a caster or a dps weapon. If it's got intellect, stam, and either 2 of crit/haste/mastery and a proc that has chance to increase haste/crit/mastery on spell cast. Then it would be both. <br />

Lending credence to the fact that Malygos didn't in fact die. It was never totally revealed what they were doing with the Ley Lines, or what Malygos was doing prior to the pull within the Eye of Eternity. I wouldn't find too odd of a stretch to find Malygos, and possibly Nozdromu, to be the ones working to alter time. Perhaps this is the whole reason for the Caverns of Time raid. Malygos is seeking to prevent the creation of the Dragon/Demon soul, and therefore save his flight. We are going to deal with the infinite dragon flight once and for all.<br />
<br />
Just a theory.</div></div><hr />

It should be solo quest driven to a certain point then 5 man then raid. <br />
But that would require imagination and a little work something World of Warcraft no longer has. Not just copy and paste, change the names and/or amount a previous ex-pacs legendary quest line had.<br />
<br />
Because Sulfuras and Thunderfury didn't have things that could be bought, right? Hell, Sulfuras was a fucking endless pit of trade mats to make. This isn't a new trend.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Clearly we should all base our decisions on a Datamined picture of a Staff which we have not actually seen in game, and which we have been told specifically by Boubouille looks short because of the angle of the screenshot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Decent model, shit how its being held, and it needs to be longer.<br />
<br />
<br />
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.<br />
<br />
Also, that screenshot isn't really good, it's slightly longer than it looks. (Oh god the jokes.)</div></div><hr />

I suspect this has something to do with how it will happen. Maybe we see more about what Alexstraza does with the Heart of Magic. If anyone is capable of &quot;powerful magic&quot; to block the vision of the Bronze Flight, it would be another Aspect.<br />
<br />
If Alexstrasza were to have blocked the Bronze Dragonflight from being aware of death of Malygos, then it would interestingly be the catalyst could that set the Bronze 'flight on the path towards becoming the Infinite Dragonflight that is trying to alter history in the first place</div></div><hr />

Although the fact that the third stage has its own icon may mean that the second stage is somehow just a higher ilevel epic version than the first stage which means this one could be an even more involved of an upgrade/ construction chain than previous legendaries...</div></div><hr />

And if so, will there be some way to compensate Shamans for the fact that they'll be losing over 13k armor from not being able to use a shield, whereas all the other staff using classes lose nothing, because offhands don't have armor.<br />
<br />
Perhaps just put armor on the staff for Shamans to compensate for a shield of similar gear level.</div></div><hr />

I think they will have to make it bad for healers....i don't know maybe make the proc drop a stack when you cast a healing type spell?</div></div><hr />

Nothing, because PVE items like this are not designed for PVP. You can always swap to a one hander and shield if you are getting meleed anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blade of the Witching Hour + Book of Binding Will + Offhand enchant = 376 int, 448 secondary stats.<br />
<br />
Chelley's Staff of Dark Mending = 341 int, 456 secondary stats<br />

I don't think it'll be hard for a legendary to make up for 35int ;D</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, it's probably like the TBC stuff at the same time - you are going into the Firelands to introduce you to the Caverns of Time storyline for a future raid. The quests are almost assuredly referring to the War of the Ancients.<br />
<br />
I'll be very surprised if those &quot;visions&quot; are not about the War of the Ancients in one way or another, and then we'll see it in the patch after the Firelands, probably.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edited to show speculation and for other things.<br />
<br />
Found this on wowwiki:<br />
<br />
In Cataclysm Edit<br />
This section concerns content exclusive to Cataclysm.<br />
Main article: War of the Ancients (instance)<br />
According to a recent interview with Tom Chilton, which took place on June 8th, 2010, War of the Ancients will be a Caverns of Time raid instance released some time during the World of Warcraft: Cataclysm patch cycle.[1]<br />
