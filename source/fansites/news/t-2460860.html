Raid Testing Schedule - January 10th<br />
On Thursday, January 10th we will be conducting our first raid tests of the Crucible of Storms.<br />
<br />
Thursday, January 10th<br />
The Restless Cabal - Heroic Crucible of Storms<br />
13:00 PST (16:00 EST, 22:00 CET)<br />
<br />
As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a test environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the bosses being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br />
<br />
Q: How do I get into the raid zone?<br />
A: In Zuldazar, Boralus, Dalaran, Orgrimmar, or Stormwind, you may speak to Nexus-Lord Donjon Rade III in order to teleport into the raid zone while it is open for testing. (The option to teleport into a zone will not be available when the zone is not open for testing.)<br />
<br />
Q: What character should I use to test the raid?<br />
A: Whichever you prefer. We will be scaling players’ effective level to 120 for raid testing, and their item level to an appropriate threshold for the encounter(s) being tested.<br />
<br />
Q: How long does testing last?<br />
A: The primary purpose of testing is to give us the information we need to balance the encounters, evaluate how mechanics are playing out in practice, and identify bugs. Once we’re satisfied that we’ve received that information for a given boss, we’ll be shutting down testing. Usually this takes anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours, but there are no guarantees.<br />
<br />
<br />
Feedback: Mythic Keystone Dungeons<br />
The Tides of Vengeance update came with a fair few tweaks to Mythic Keystone Dungeons. Now that a few weeks have passed since the update went live, we wanted to take a moment to gather your thoughts are on the changes. This can be about anything you’ve experienced; be it specific dungeons, affixes, or the system as a whole.<br />
<br />
If you haven’t yet tried some of the retuned dungeons I encourage you to try them out before commenting, particularly dungeons like Temple of Sethralis, King’s Rest, and Siege of Boralus, all of which received the biggest changes.<br />
<br />
Thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts!<br />
<br />
One major thing that I do notice when pushing higher keys (On tyrannical specifically) is that some of the HP on bosses seem to be astronomically scaled. I would like to see the HP on some particular bosses (Finals in Atal’Dazar and Shrine specifically) scaled back a little bit. Shrine of the Storm, with the changes in the way the damage increasing debuff is applied, makes it feel like the Boss’ pool of health is simply too large.<br />
Funny enough, the team actually is looking at the final bosses health in Shrine and I think are testing some changes to it. Nothing to share exactly on it, but it is being looked at. I’ll mention Atal as well.<br />
<br />

Regeneratin' (Zandalari racial) Balance<br />
It’s worth noting (Regeneratin' (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/291944-regeneratin)):<br />
<br />
These values are not final.<br />
The aspect of this where it is not interrupted by damage is unintended.<br />
We’re discussing it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you. (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1104689-regeneratin-zandalari-racial-is-crazy-op/) / Official Forums (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/68531/22))<br />

No Lore QA Thread<br />
Thanks for making the thread. I thought about doing one when I didn’t see a link to a blue post on forums but then saw your comment on blog page.<br />
People have been asking for different types of Q&amp;As, especially a lore one so it’ll be a nice change. Ofc not making a Q&amp;A thread here is kinda odd since more people come here than read news section, so I have a feeling it’s going to be more of what they want to talk about instead of what we really want to know more about. I’m looking forward to seeing how it turns out though <br />
We didn’t make a thread here because it’s meant to be more of a discussion on topics and not so much a Q&amp;A. We are trying something different and didn’t want to inflate expectations that a pile of questions would be answered when it’s possible that just a couple topics could lead to back and forth chatting for the whole stream time. If there are areas you are particular curious of then go ahead and post them here or in the blog and we’ll pass them on. Keep in mind certain areas are often difficult to discuss without giving away spoilers.

<br />
either way, IF you really are connected and it still your „baby“ you just will not move out that quickly. even with personal problems, you maybe slow down everything, but you will never move out of stuff you invested your whole life from the ground up. IF you do, this totally obviously says something about, that you just no longer want, in no way.</div></div><hr />

So what does that actually mean? 1% Drop rate before was based on 20 man raid, so one out of 2000 attempts when soloing, whereas now it's based on raids regardless of size, so if you're solo, it's one out of 100 attempts now?</div></div><hr />

Yeah because a studio is expected to push a game out within 2 years right? Not get their infrastructure sorted and cash flow. <br />
<br />
Blizzard didn't start making their own games until 1993. Up until then they just made ports for already existing games.<br />

Crazy how stupid most of you are.<br />
<br />
His personal money and the company money are different things, ergo his money doesn't matter here. More probably, Mike's interests and ideas for Blizzard has been conflicting with Activision ones from the beginning and one or both parts had enough. <br />
<br />
Yeah, they can fire someone like Mike if they want/need. Stocks matters more than veterany in any financial titan, have that in mind.</div></div><hr />

You're an idiot if you can't tell that he was forced out after stepping down as CEO. A 6 month advisory role? yeah right.</div></div><hr />

However reading that Mike is leaving for good makes me want to cry. What have they done to my favourite game developer company?!<br />
It is sad days for blizz fans. Ive seen the company rises through listening to gamers and being a gamers/developer driven company. Now only money matters. I feed terrible. Please end this bullshit. Close the doors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes. Not sure if it's 1% drop rate tho, but the logic is right.<br />
<br />
For instance the kara time run mount had a 20% drop rate per player. 5 players = 100% drop rate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or at least a studio that still has passion for games. Because with Activision and the grip it has on Blizzard these days this company has absolutely no passion.<br />
<br />
Activision can go to hell for the way they are treating Blizzard if I'm honest.<br />
<br />
There is no grip, it is one entity and it just outweighed the Blizzard side from the get go of the merger and it was inevitable. I am just glad I found a private server that Blizztavision doesn't care about and I will remain there until WoW has a turn around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought mythic mounts (20 person raids) were 100% drop rate, but only 1 drop. <br />
<br />
i.e. in a group of 20, there's a 1/20 chance of getting the mount (each person brings a 5% chance).<br />
<br />
But if there was 15 people in the mythic raid, there wouldn't be a 1/15 chance, still a 1/20. Which didn't make it a 6.667% chance of the mount dropping, still 5%, but if it landed on the 16, 17, 18, 19 or 20th slots, no one got the mount as it didn't drop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He has about 1.8 billion reasons not to regret anything.</div></div><hr />
