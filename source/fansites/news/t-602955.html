(Updated) Focused Will (Priest) changes<br />
Healer's day ! Follow-up of yesterday's post about priests, and a talent upgrades for druids.<br />
Feedback was read, gathered and the designers are fully aware of all that you've provided. As a result, we're making an adjustment to the talent so instead of seeing this morning's version of focused will in the next PTR push, you'll see:<br />
<br />
&quot;After taking a critical hit you gain the Focused Will effect, reducing all damage taken by 1/3/5% and increasing healing effects on you by 4/7/10% for 6 seconds. Stacks up to 3 times.&quot;<br />
<br />
(Updated) Natural Perfection (Druid) Changes<br />
We've read through a great deal of feedback and are making another adjustment to the natural perfection talent which you'll see in the next PTR data push.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now also grants the Natural Perfection effect after being critically hit, reducing all damage taken by 1/3/5% for 6 seconds. Stacks up to 3 times.&quot; <br />

hokay u could get it stack up to 5 in 5on5 arena as focustarget but thats it.. only moment when this talent is usefull.. <br />
can't believe they nerfed a skill wich priests where whining about before it even was on liveserver.. i mean wtf<br />
but anyway the skill would be quite usefull with 10 sek+ duration OR much better just 3 stacks with 5% less dmg 10% more heal each.. <br />
in solo fights this skill will suck hard. let's say a warrior crits u twice with his frist 3 attacks then hits u again after 3,5 sek noncrit zomg -6% dmg ..buff ends, next hit+ms hits u for 100% dmg<br />
have to hate it, hope they change it</div></div><hr />

-talent made for green geared people<br />
-only good in 2vs2,3vs3<br />
-if 4 people target you in 5vs5 and ur other healer isnt focusing or is cced ur dead anyway<br />
-i think its fine 6sec is oke else it would be too overpowered compared to other classes<br />
it gets refreshed anyway through any form of crit strike (including the onces neglected by resil atleast from what i have heard)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cluelessnoob</div><div class="date">2007-10-31, 01:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, Discipline priest in the arenas. Focused Will reduces incoming damage and increases healing after a crit - does it suck though?<br />
<br />
Well heck, right after the crit, Martyrdom was applied to the priest. Now he's got 100% pushback resistance and 20% interrupt resistance. So he's likely going to get a heal off on himself ... and now it's got a healing bonus, and he's less likely to die before the spell gets off. That doesn't suck.<br />
<br />
Also, assuming proper spec, the priest has just enough Holy talents to have 3/3 Blessed Recovery, so over the 6 seconds after the crit, he's going to get 25% of that damage back. And technically speaking, the talent reads that it's a heal, meaning Focused Will should in theory buff the heal from Blessed Recovery. That doesn't suck.<br />
<br />
Also in theory, the disc priest in the arena has 10% incoming spell damage reduction from Spell Warding. Focused Will adds to that. Again, doesn't suck.<br />
<br />
If the priest is taking damage from infrequent sources, such as Fireball, Shadowbolt, or a phat 2-hand weapon, Focused Will is unlikely to stack; but the priest also has more time to get a heal off between damage sources.<br />
<br />
Whereas a dual-wielder's attacks, or a BM pet's attacks, are going to stack up the buff from 3 to 5 stacks, meanwhile proc'ing Martyrdom to allow the priest to get a heal off on himself.<br />
<br />
This talent doesn't sound as incredible as Nature's Guardian, for instance, but it's quite possibly even better. And we should all know by now how damn hard it is to focus and down a well-geared resto shaman as the first target. Focused Will in conjunction with other talents (including the maligned but arena-useful Martyrdom) will force many of our teams to focus a mage/rogue first and chain CC the priest - instead of always focusing a priest first, as soon as he pops up in Proximo.</div></div><hr />

in the perfect world where mortal strike, curse of tonges and counterspell doenst exist.<br />
on all the arenas against a warrior or rogue u have the -50% healing effects so 12,5% of blessed recovery+4,16%of extra healing of 3 stacks of focused will wont be a lifesaver.<br />
<br />
20% interrupt resistance is 80% that a kick, counterspell... would cut your heal.</div></div><hr />

well arena fights in much higher rating than u seem to have don't work like this. it takes some time there till someone dies even if there is a focus of 3 dd's on the priest..so the talent is very usefull in such moments</div></div><hr />

<br />
Clearly, Blizzard employees need to play healers more themselves...<br />
<br />
<br />
yes, and the old method was, you get hit by a 5k shadow bolt, then hit by 13 non-critting shadow bolts for 2k each, with no damage reduction.<br />
<br />
as for others who realize the truth, this is a buff at 3 stacks than the old version. it now reduces ALL damage, and seeing how crits are for &lt;2x, this means they have to pack more than 50% crit for this to be seen as a nerf.<br />
<br />
as for having 4 ppl on you at once, you all need to play higher ranked games, it is still hell to drop someone.<br />
<br />
also, to the guy saying that you will still get kicked while heailng, this talent makes your renew, blessed life, prayer of mending all hit for more, not to mention that if you have another healers (even shadow preist), this will make them more effective.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">schworck</div><div class="date">2007-11-01, 11:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, if been playing some bgs now, and it's simple:<br />
<br />
if u have a rouge on you, you will be having a permant 5 stacked buff on you. chances are, the same thing will apply to any other melee... with wl/mage against you, it's all about waiting for the cs to hit, and heal happily ever after i guess. <br />
<br />
so far, i don't know if i would give up 10% + heal to receive this feature.</div></div><hr />
