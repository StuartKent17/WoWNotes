#422 (New) - Dearest $n, I look back upon our adventures together as if they happened yesterday. Several of my admirers informed me that you looked rather... sullen... when last we met. While I see no reason for such behavior when you had the pleasure of working with the world-renowned Johnny Awesome, I did feel a twang of... what was it... pity? Being as such, I felt it appropriate to send you this tip as a token of my appreciation for your efforts. Do people still tip? Listen, if people do NOT still tip, please return all attachments to me at once. I'm not made of money, you know. -Johnny<br />

Mog coin currency? Dance studio? TW raids already? All in a patch that's suppose to be relatively small and focused on class design? There's just no way.<br />
<br />
Everything sounds insanely cool though but I don't believe any of it. An ingame xmog content sounds awesome. TW raid will be interesting (most likely easy, but still interesting). However all of this seems fairly sporadic so I still don't know</div></div><hr />

Who cares at this point? It's not like it's going to be anywhere near the level of difficulty it used to be.<br />

It'll just be a LFR faceroll zergfest. The mobs in the Black Temple will merely serve as loot pinatas with no foreseeable threat to the raid.<br />

<br />
could be something they are going to iterate on for awhile as well, like start testing timewalking raids in the 7.2.5 ptr but not have them release until 7.3 or 7.3.5 since it really sounds like something they would pull out to try and keep people engaged when the final raid tier has gone into farm mode and people are just waiting on the next expansion</div></div><hr />

No it's a great thing. It means they don't plan to give hunters anymore retarded nerfs they don't need. At this point I'd be content if they just fucking left hunters alone for the rest of the expansion instead of doing more damage.<br />

Another key focus for this patch is on class design, particularly for a few specs that need some extra attention. We’re likely to end up making adjustments for many specs to some degree...<br />

<br />
It's a mid-expansion patch, you can't expect them to rework half of all the specs, especially since they already have to do it for 7 specs. As long as hunters (and others like Enhancers) receive some decent buffs it will be okay. They stated that class design is one of the key points of this patch so I wouldn't hang myself up on words like &quot;likely&quot;. Hunters probably won't be on the top of the DPS charts after the patch but I guess there will be plenty of adjustments just like right before Nighthold.</div></div><hr />

- mythic keystone difficulty for dungeons - it would replace Legion dungeons on tw weeks.<br />

The thing is that this is not a majority. It's just as much as vanilla servers are, wich means, a niche only, sorry.<br />
<br />
You saw how much the majority people enjoyed MC &quot;timewalking&quot; and how much the majority enjoy the current dungeon ones (if people really enjoyed it, they would not be filling it with toys, mounts and bonuses for current content to make people actually go for it).<br />
<br />
The only difference between timewalking and vanilla servers is that timewalking requires much less effort and generates &quot;content&quot; (just like Blizzard once said that LFR was new content...).</div></div><hr />

Hardly going to happen, this is low cost/low maintenance &quot;content&quot;.

<br />

As Havoc you can instantly regenerate 25% of your health everytime you kill an enemy. It is one of the best forms of self-sustain imo.</div></div><hr />

No that's why I ask I have a DH one of my main character that I enjoy very much. They're actually in a relatively strong spot and when they say things like &quot;changes&quot; makes me just think &quot;let's mess with the spec he enjoys&quot; lol.<br />

Yeah, but while leveling you have trouble fighting elites and large groups, it's a lot easier to just go Vengeance. You can pull huge groups and kill them all at once instead of having to play it safe.<br />

I feel like it still has to be additional foreshadowing... they said we're going to Argus in 7.3 so the Old Gods can't have their comeback until after that which means our characters won't think our world is under a threat when they leave for Argus. Maybe it will be all messed up by the Old Gods when we come back... or... worse... much worse.<br />

Thought the dance studio was a joke which was further emphasized by timewalking BT and then the cheese pun. But reading the rest ... ugh.<br />
<br />
Great. Black Temple timewalking. Yay. Much like the timewalking dungeons, I get to run BT all over again like I did 10 years ago. Only this time I get to run with people who don't know English, don't listen, and don't know how to coordinate so a 2 1/2 - 3 hour raid becomes an 8+ hour one with a 2000g+ repair bill attached and rewards that are so crappy they don't even cover my repair costs. I have a fit with stupid tanks who don't clear the first room in Arcatraz. If people fail doing that, I can't imagine how badly they'll fail just on Naj'entus with the spears, Shade of Akama with adds, Teron Gorefiend with the ghost mechanic, Gurtogg Bloodboil with his debuff, Reliquary of Souls with the interrupts and then not killing yourself in phase 3, Mother Shahraz ... oh god, Illidari Council and not dropping blizzard on everyone because everyone spreads out all over the place rather than grouping up into smaller groups while failing to interrupt Malande, and then Illidan himself ...<br />
<br />
What's Blizzard going to do with the BT drops? Not have any T6 drop since they'd have to have it scale and there's an issue with half of the set being in MH? Issue of DKs, monks, and DH tier, too unless they put another recolor of the ToS tier into the timewalking BT. What about the warglaives? Will they get an epic version only available to DH or available to everyone who can use a sword? Blizzard's not going to let a legendary be transmoggable regardless if they add an epic version or not. They'd just put in a different warglaive style. And if you think BT is going to be a challenge, it won't be. It'll be like an entry level raid that gives crappy loot as a reward so as to not step on the toes of ToS and even Broken Shore. At best, it'll drop 850 iLvL gear. There's also the question if Blizzard's going to shift some drops for level 100+ to be relics for artifacts or if the drops will be the same as it is now but scaled which means BT is worthless for artifacts.<br />
<br />
I'm not looking forward to this at all. If I wanted to do BT, I'd go solo it without the headache of stupid people who don't know basic mechanics and won't listen when the mechanics are explained. This is the LAZY way to &quot;add&quot; content. Guess this is how Blizzard's going to entertain us. Broken Shore doesn't have enough content to hold over most players until patch 7.3 so they're going to slap timewalking on old content, add a few crappy micro holidays, and hope that holds people over.<br />
<br />
Guess it's no surprise they decided to bring back Black Temple considering the T6 revamp in ToS and Illidan's return. BWL would have only made sense during Cata when BWD was current but Blizzard didn't have the timewalking tech then. But if Blizzard's done MC and now BT, that suggests a return to Northrend is next just so they have an excuse to do a timewalking ICC. Then we'll probably see Azshara and the old gods after that because Deathwing would be rather hard to bring back.<br />
<br />
The transmog scenario seems ... odd. How is that one going to work? If it's players voting, they'll just vote for themselves regardless if their outfit fits the theme or not unless you can't vote for yourself. If it's NPCs, they'll vote based upon how many items you use that correspond to a theme regardless if it looks good. If you have an item that uses the theme, you'll get 1 point, otherwise you get 0. Maybe they'll recognize colors so maybe give you 1 point if the colors all match and 0 points if they don't. So it might end up being like a 20 point system or something if the NPCs vote. At that point, it wouldn't really be a question of what you like. It'd just be beating the equation.<br />
<br />
I don't see this patch appeasing people who are already displeased with patch 7.2. I was hoping for things like more WQs for Legionfall rep either in the Broken Shore itself or scattered around the Broken Isles, rep adjustments so you can get to exalted faster with the other reps, more with the class halls, etc. This ... it's not even close to what I was hoping for. It's not even remotely what I expected since I expected SOMETHING to expand on 7.2, not a bunch of useless crap which will entertain for maybe 5 minutes before people either get bored or get pissed.</div></div><hr />

Everything sounds insanely cool though but I don't believe any of it. An ingame xmog content sounds awesome. TW raid will be interesting (most likely easy, but still interesting). However all of this seems fairly sporadic so I still don't know<br />

I think the start of the Infinite Dragonflight is when the Old Gods convince Nozdormu that it would be totally rad to save the world by changing the timelines and therefore we have to go back and stop them every time eventually killing Nozdormus alter ego Murozond.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now living outside of time, Murozond was once the great Dragon Aspect Nozdormu the Timeless One. After the titans showed him his own death, the tormented Nozdormu was tricked by the Old Gods into trying to subvert his mortality. As a result, Nozdormu shattered the timeways and created the infinite dragonflight... jeopardizing the very future of Azeroth.&quot; - Dungeon Journal<br />

Just to clarify: the specs I called out in the original post are those we're planning major rotational/mechanical changes to. We're also planning talent/balance tuning for many other specs (e.g. Fire Mage, Blood DK, others) that don't need a mechanical overhaul but could still use some numbers love.<br />

<br />
the point i was making there are plenty of specs that need an overhual that numbers tuning won't really fix.....i.e moonkin .<br />
<br />
they can get a numbers boost just like they did in 7.1.5 and weeks later lose most of it because of scaling and movement penalties because how the spec works. on top of other problems.<br />
<br />
<br />
there was never any doubt classes would get tuned up and down, like the huge 8-10% nerf for frost mages and aff warlocks hitting soon.</div></div><hr />

And BWLs first 2 bosses would completely murder any LFR group<br />
<br />
2nd boss was litteraly a patchwerk fight was it not....memory faded a long long time ago from vanilla raiding</div></div><hr />

Yep. Vael. He has a debuff that kills everyone slowly over time - pure DPS race. <br />
<br />
The first one is the mind control one - that one should be easy, but I could see LFR heroes fucking it up. <br />
<br />
Nefarian with the class calls...should be interesting in a LFR situation. They'd have to add monks and demon hunters, tho.</div></div><hr />
