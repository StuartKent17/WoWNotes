More worthless than a faster cast of Death Gate? Or perhaps the ability to cast a cheaper Seal of Justice? <br />
<br />
I dunno there are so many worthless glyphs now, perhaps it is worth deciding which really is the most terrible. A bigger pet can have a decent psychological advantage on younger players that are scared of OMG DINOSAUR IS RED NOOOO. Then they die.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only knot in that kite string is that hunters on the PTR are reporting that the &quot;boss skin&quot; wasps have all been shrunk down to be closer in line with the size of the regular/Silithid wasps. Still, though, this is nice for anyone who's tamed a gigantic pet (like a Devilsaur, or even a nightsaber-model cat) and kinda frowned when they shrunk down to a far less intimidating dinky size. It certainly replaces the old King Of Useless Hunter Glyphs since the removal of Glyph of Possessed Strength. I'm all for the addition of more flavor and cosmetic glyphs, though. (Just not ones quite this absurd.)<br />
<br />
That being said, I'm kinda sad to see the Pet Happiness mechanic go away. Sure it was kinda annoying to keep bits of food around for a pet (and hunting for a fruit or bread or cheese vendor when you've just tamed a new pet but all you've got is meat or fish in your bag), but it was a nice bit of immersion.<br />
<br />
Now that it's really no longer an issue, can y'all figure out the bits of code that'll allow pets to once again run alongside a mounted character? My wyvern non-combat pet can fly behind me ... why exactly can't my wasp or bat or whatever? (I get the hangup in non-flying pets + flying mounts.) All things considered, can we differentiate between flying mounts and non-flying mounts for the sake of pets/minions running or flying alongside their master?</div></div><hr />

The happiness system has finally been removed...I might actually roll a proper hunter now.<br />
That's just silly. It was already a virtually non-existent mechanic in game since WOTLK. Your pets had some way to get happiness via some talent, and there's always been the glyph for mend pet.</div></div><hr />

Don't worry, first they just need to gimp your class so that two of your three specs are unusable. Then they'll nerf the third spec, then they'll keep messing stuff up for ages before finally acknowledging that your class has been messed up for quite some time.<br />
<br />
Once they've done that they'll give your pets some attention. :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even as Enhancement I like having hunters with me, the amount of control and CC they can provide to a flagging group is worth a lot more to me than any potential loot conflicts might detract (and I don't really need heroic gear anymore anyway), and also the buffs they provide are complementary to mine. I'd rather have a successful run where I don't get loot than a run where the uncontested loot doesn't even drop because the group fails.<br />

And, I don't know if it will count or not for Ele, I read it to mean &quot;Cloth/leather/mail/plate&quot;, didn't think it would distinguish &quot;int mail vs. agi mail&quot; but given that that distinction IS coded into the need roll ability, it is a possibility.</div></div><hr />

Hahahaha. I remember when I first rolled a hunter. I figured I wouldn't need to constantly feed my pet because no other mmo I've played has had that retarded feature. Fast forward a few hours and my fluffy little wolf has ran away. Wtf? I haven't rolled a hunter since. That was some seriously flawed and un-fun design, and I'm glad it completely dead now :)<br />
<br />
Wtf is the point then? It's an RPG. You are supposed to be playing the role of your character. This game is getting to be so damn automated now that there is absolutely no depth to anything now. Just click this button for phat lewts. I enjoyed feeding my pet. Animals usually need food to stay alive, and having a pet that was Level 6 best friend meant alot. I've had the same cat since I started playing.</div></div><hr />

adj<br />
1. being the only one of a particular type; single; sole<br />

We were the only one's with any form of depth to pets, which is the core of the class. We were the only one's with ammo. I'm pretty sure we were unique.<br />
<br />
And what you call tedious upkeep, I call depth. Those things made the game and the class feel more alive than when everything is handed to you on a silver platter.

<br />
We still have more depth to our pets than any other class. We have to seek out and tame our pets. We have a huge selection of pets with different appearances and abilities to choose from, and there are even rare pets we can spend time trying to catch. We have to level our pets (albeit a lot less than we used to, which I think is a good change) and we get to distribute talent points to further customize our pets.<br />
<br />
As for ammo, I see we're just not going to see eye to eye on this. You say it was something you had to think about. True, you had to remember it or you couldn't function as your class. But it didn't offer a decisions you had to make, there weren't different arrows for different occasions that you had to choose. It was just, &quot;Before the raid go get the arrows with the highest dps that I have access to.&quot; That isn't interesting, it's just upkeep.

I loved having that bag space devoted to nothing but ammo, didn't you? Oh, wait, quivers don't provide a buff anymore because it's baked in and the arrows stack to 1000 now. Neat, so I don't need a whole bag now for when we're going to be spending five hours learning fights or doing a full-clear. I'll just fit about 5 stacks next to the mana biscuits and/or regular health restoring food, the stacks of water, the buff food, the happiness-restoring food for my specific pet, the pet buff food, the flasks, the pots, the bandaids, maybe a few extra boxes of engineer-made ammo just in case something bad happens, the extra odd bits of gear I swap out because I like more haste for this fight or extra crit for that fight NO THE WARLOCK CAN NOT HAVE THE FUCKING ONYXIA HIDE BACKPACK I DON'T GODDAMN CARE HOW MANY SHARDS HE FRIGGIN' NEEDS IT'S MINE<br />
<br />
Sure, tanks and healers carry around an extra set of gear for an off spec or a main spec. A hunter who wanted to be prepared for both DPS and pet maitenance lugged around just as much shit. Running out of ammo mid-fight is just as embarrassing as having your bow break while you're tanking Mimiron's Head - I can speak from experience on both. Just about every hunter's checked their ammo when that instance or raid has run longer than anticipated and you're cringing as the stack count of your ammo gets lower ... and lower ... maybe I shouldn't pop Rapid Fire just yet. ....thank god Volley only uses &quot;one arrow&quot; instead of actually firing that many, huh?<br />
<br />
Warlocks didn't want the tedium of lugging around a bag of shards and having to stop after a while and go farm more shards off a raid member /duel when the instance ran too long. (Or having to have 39 EXTRA shards lying about for raid nights pre-Demon TV.) Managing your pet and ammo were immersion, yeah. It was fun tee hee hee look my piggy's eating an apple awwwww good piggy, but to your average raider who doesn't give two shits about immersion and wants two less things to worry about come raid night, not having to make sure he's spent the small fortune on ammo and pet food is a welcome relief.<br />
<br />
<br />
TEAL DEER: I agree. Ammo/food was fun, but tedious and mind-numbing enough as it is.<br />
ETA: &gt;while you're taking Mimiron's Head - paging Dr. Freud, come in Dr. Freud...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why would the change increase the queues a single bit? At the moment, the queues are long, because there are no healers, or even more, tanks to fill the groups. Let's assume, just for the fun of it, that there are 10 dps queuing per each tank/healer (this is probably too low of a number) - before this change, the system would just have taken the dps at random, and for your 40 minutes of wait, you would have gotten a group with 3 mages, for example. Now, the system looks at the available dps, and tries to put one cloth-wearer, one leather-wearer and one mail-wearer to the group instead of the 3 mages... I don't think this will increase the queues at all, they will still be capped by the amount of tanks/healers available, dps is readily available as is.<br />
<br />
[Edit:] Just noticed this:<br />
<br />
<br />
That's the reason we say it will attempt to do this. There is coding to recognize, and try and match, damage-dealing classes with different armor types, but it will not ultimately do this at the expense of forming a group. The criteria for forming a group will become less stringent if the pool of players the Dungeon Finder is selecting from isn't sufficient.</div></div><hr />

The pet system, the arrows. It made hunters unique. What are you now? Random petclass X. Taurous has the right idea. It removed what made hunter, a hunter. But I guess a silly fanboy can't see that. It's cute though, it really thinks it's witty.<br />
<br />
No, fluffy is reasonable and by no means is fanboy, live your dream. Any 'depth' of managing hunter and pet was murdered back when LK launched, but NOW we see outcry when they finally decide to remove that spoiled and lost concept of pet happiness. Boo hoo, go hug your pixelized fleabag, maybe you'll feel better and unique. <br />
Oi! Don't forget to press mend pet once a day to keep it happy!<br />
<br />
As for arrows as a sign of uniqueness... No thanks, I'd rather not spend my money to be able to shoot, and then pay again cause my weapon breaks in process of shooting. In before rogue's poisons.<br />
<br />
And yes, you did care enough to respond. Fluffy was successful.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh look! It's so easy to feed your pet now: because you don't need to anymore!Please, write me down 'Guide to hardcore pet feeding', I wanna feel superiority over any other class when I toss meat to my spider. Man, I feel like making yell macro: I'm feeding my pet for infinite happiness! Bow down before my mighty &lt;insert pet family here&gt;! Feel it's wrath unleashed upon you lesser beings!<br />
<br />
Feed pet will be better than ever. Instant 50% hp right outside of combat. I know it's not really helpful when my pet's self healing combined with Avoidance and Cower makes it unkillable in raiding, but my spider will gladly accept this, as it's my utility pet for pvp and yes, it sometimes gets hit.</div></div><hr />

Unless your pet was constantly dying without being fed, the happiness system was non-existent. My hunter has had a stack of 20 roast beef in his backpack since cata started and has used exactly 1 in 3 months. This change probably just reduced the amount of calculations the game must make.</div></div><hr />

I do not, just do not understand why people are against the removal of pet happiness. It has been a complete non issue for an entire expansion now, just requiring you to spam Mend Pet. This is something they should have done ages ago. Pet happiness doesn't add anything to the game. <br />
<br />
And those of you who say the new glyph is useless have no sense of fun. I for one will love carting around giant pets.<br />
<br />
You do realize how contradictory your two comments are. The answer to your first comment is what you said in your second comment. People actually liked playing hunters because they are a pet class.... but pets are becoming more and more like Bane of Affliction or Flame Orb.. a single dot that you really don´t have to do anything with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah see if this had been vanilla I might have agreed with you. Fact is, however, that pet happiness was outdated as the &quot;unique hunter mechanic&quot; the moment pet talents were introduced (and it has, coincidentally, been marginalized ever since that faithful moment). They add far more unique depth than a flat damage modifier depending on nomnomnom ever will, and as long as happiness was provided passively through aforementioned glyphs and talents there's little point in keeping it around.<br />
<br />
TL;DR - Pet talents were/are the new and improved pet happiness.</div></div><hr />

How is removing happiness dumbing it down? It was an outdated and useless mechanic that no Hunter even pays attention to since the pets and glyphs automatically give pets happiness. Removing happiness changes nothing.<br />

The only knot in that kite string is that hunters on the PTR are reporting that the &quot;boss skin&quot; wasps have all been shrunk down to be closer in line with the size of the regular/Silithid wasps. Still, though, this is nice for anyone who's tamed a gigantic pet (like a Devilsaur, or even a nightsaber-model cat) and kinda frowned when they shrunk down to a far less intimidating dinky size. It certainly replaces the old King Of Useless Hunter Glyphs since the removal of Glyph of Possessed Strength. I'm all for the addition of more flavor and cosmetic glyphs, though. (Just not ones quite this absurd.)<br />
I would be more happy if they've made that glyph decreasing the size of the pet instead. As of right now, my wolf pet is 1.5 times larger than its goblin master.</div></div><hr />

But I'm glad they recognized exactly why they put all those happiness-boosters into the game - because pet Happiness was at one time a pain in the butt to manage, as was Loyalty.

It was/is needed. Arcane is WAY behind other dps specs right now and given that it has no place/use in any real/organized PVP (sure maybe random BG's you can crush people with AB spam, try doing that in arenas or rated bg's and see how long it takes you to get spell locked/counterspelled and then immediately roflstomped).<br />

The blizzard buff is a buff to arcane mages. I'm fairly certain Blizzard (the company not the spell) has given up trying to make frost viable in PVE and PVP. As much as I loved playing frost in PVE I actually understand and agree with their choice; it's simply impossible for them to balance for PVE and PVP at the same time across 3 specs per class, so the solution is to just say &quot;this is your PVP spec, you can at least choose between these two PVE specs&quot;</div></div><hr />

Balance druids say hi, secondly he had a valid point with deepfreeze. Last I checked nobody was immune to stuns so buffing its dmg or adding a dot would be the perfect way to do it since it will only affect pve.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree, I think Blizzard has given up on Frost and Subtle as pve specs. They are both just so strong in PvP that it is really hard to buff them anywhere without absolutely gutting them in pvp first. The two specs that are still lagging in Pve are surprsing, arcane and BM. They seem to be fixing arcane now, but still nothign for BM. Frost DKs were also on the low side, but they are getting the blood rune change, which I honestly think will make them the most OP spec next tier, we will see.</div></div><hr />

* A dead player can now be resurrected by targeting them using the Party or Raid Frame even if they have released. No more hunting for corpses.<br />
<br />
<br />
And how hard was that change to make? -.- Been annoying me since vanilla.</div></div><hr />

Totally didn't see that coming...stop trying to make Arms viable for PvE keep it for PvP we were doing fine with that route stick with it. All this mingling and trying to bring Arms up to par with Fury is quite annoying.<br />
<br />
Hey buddy, speak for yourself. I hate Fury spec and I'd like to be able to do my raiding without being bottlenecked into a spec I hate.<br />

I agree, I think Blizzard has given up on Frost and Subtle as pve specs. They are both just so strong in PvP that it is really hard to buff them anywhere without absolutely gutting them in pvp first. The two specs that are still lagging in Pve are surprsing, arcane and BM. They seem to be fixing arcane now, but still nothign for BM. Frost DKs were also on the low side, but they are getting the blood rune change, which I honestly think will make them the most OP spec next tier, we will see.<br />
<br />
The problem with those specs is that they rely mechanics that would be considered game breakers in PvE like shatter combos and restealthing to make the most of their talents. That is why those specs are strong in PvP and you can't really bridge the gap by upping damage as it would make those 2 specs (even more so) overpowered in PvP. Personally I'm happy provided they always keep at least 2 specs viable for both PvE and PvP in each class.</div></div><hr />

3 plate - none of them are pure dmg dealer<br />
2 mail - 1 pure dmg dealer<br />
2 leather - 1 pure dmg dealer<br />
3 cloth - 2 pure dmg dealers<br />
Now, playing a lock or mage is going to be like a hour queue if you are to bother with LFG.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We really don´t know to what extent they will make people wait. I highly doubt they will allow it to drastically increase queue times since they obviously are aware that most times there is 30 minutes or more. My guess is they will only look at the next 6 dpsers in queue and match them based on gear as best they can. In other words if number 1 and 3 are both plate wearers, they may bump number 3 back to number 4 (ie, with the next group).</div></div><hr />

Certainly not the worst dps in PvE or PvP.<br />
<br />
Btw, where is your spell steal (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2127-Upcoming-Class-Changes-December-27-Hotfixes) nerf?<br />
<br />
<br />
Nice that Holy Fire can proc Evangelism. Various other changes were made for HF with Glyph of Divine Accuracy as well as Atonement, but I'm wondering why they haven't done the obvious and let HF proc Chakra, even Mind Spike was added, just doesn't make sense to me.<br />
<br />
Why you need HF to proc Chakra badly anyways?</div></div><hr />

Not so much for healing as when you're questing or doing other solo stuff. I know I've been leveling my priest since 80 as discipline, so being able to get a stack of Evangelism besides spamming Smite would be neat. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
or am i reading this all wrong?<br />
<br />
The burst is large, yes, but when we aren't bursting, our damage was considerably lower. These buffs will help us maintain damage output in between burst cycles.<br />

Woot @ 7 second flag caps! This means it will again be possible to cc &gt; flag cap. As a rogue this makes me happy.<br />
<br />
Also where is the datamined stealth change? Did it not go through or did blizz simply forget to include it in the official notes?<br />
<br />
They probably realized that a stealthed rogue moving faster than an unstealthed rogue would simply be ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

I don't, it just seems like such an obvious improvement, even if it's only a slight one.</div></div><hr />
