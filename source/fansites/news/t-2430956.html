<br />
Yeah but gearing isn't hard. Warfronts, this weekly 370, mythic dungeons, world quests. Gearing is easier than ever. Just join a casual guild or make your own mythic dungeon group if you don't want to or can't get into pugs.<br />

Why don't you still go for the garotte trait then? The idea is meant to make it balanced, not op. You still have choice.</div></div><hr />

Laser matrix and thunderous blast nerfs are going to dump all over most of the bottom 50% specs since most didn't have a spec speciffic trait worth taking already and just lost even more. This is a pretty shitty nerf.</div></div><hr />

funny i was thinking the same thing , i dont realy like laser matrix it sucks the only thing it is good at is pulling shit in other rooms <br />
<br />

only thing bad is that this shit trait was the best on my helmet.. RIP i hate this aze system i would trade them for secondary stats if i could<br />

yeah , so no i dont have my BiS trait and now my only viable option &quot;laser matrix&quot; that was place 4 or 5 is probably going to be even worse , well there we go</div></div><hr />

A crap BM trait that nobody used because it was DOA. That's hardly a buff to BM. It just means people may look twice at the trait before selecting a different one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, basically sucks for them. I just got lazer matrix today on my Ret and it’s doing about 4% of my overal DPS, and there’s nothing up there about buffing my spec specific ones that are bad. This equates to an unavoidable nerf to my spec since I can’t just swap to a trait that is now better because they’re likely still going to be worse than even a nerfed Lazer Matrix. It’s a small nerf at least though like 30% of 4% of my damage isn’t going to kill me, but it sucks that I got nothing else to pick but this trait even still...<br />
<br />
The worst part though isn’t even the nerf, it’s that these are still not fun. Playing with percentages doesn’t magically make these traits a compelling system that affects how you play your spec. This is a first-pass, but so far I’m not impressed yet.</div></div><hr />

They already take tons of damage and can barely live versus most comps. I understand lock damage on single targets can be ridiculous, but aff locks are supposed to rot, not blow someone up. When we can barely cast as it is with the numerous ways of interrupting and you take away our instant dot damage, how are aff locks supposed to be relevant to pvp? Not attacking you, just trying to bring attention to something I think is important.</div></div><hr />

<br />
edit: also, nerfing the good traits is retarded and every single dev who supported these changes is retarded too, the traits HAVE TO BE IMPACTFUL if the azerite system is supposed to be meaningful, nerfing them all to garbo levels just makes the whole point of upgrading neck completely meaningless, the pieces will be all boring and we would be better off with secondary stats than this shit. I understand its easier to nerf 10 traits than it is to buff 100 traits, but THIS will be the final nail in azerite coffin, good luck convincing anyone traits are cool when they will all be sub 1% increases...</div></div><hr />

It is a bad system, but they don't have the time for a wholesale redesign during between patch cycles. We have to hope the next expansion comes up with a better system.<br />
Meanwhile, there are sane solutions. For instance, have each gear offer 3-4 traits for a single spec (whichever your gear is locked to) so that you have some real choice about your traits, instead of defaulting to the 1 spec appropriate trait.</div></div><hr />

it was obvious they will do this. that why most of good players kept 3rd and 4th trait's azerite pieces just in case of this happening. <br />

Having the perfect traits shouldn't make or break your character.<br />
<br />
If you're super upset about this, think about it for a second, when the traits are in a better place (LOL 3 roundhouse traits!), they actually have a chance to address class/spec balance.<br />
<br />
Also do the math for a second, or wait for bloodmallet to do it - the thunderous blast nerf coupled with laser matrix, and the buffs to archive and natural harmony, this means I can actually use my highest item level pieces on my shaman without them being downgrade.

The thing is, we already had multiple sets of buffs/nerfs to traits, and very few had any real effect(because they also just nerfed a few of the top traits, so those specs went back to Thunderous Blast/Laser Matrix/Dagger in the Back stacking). They're being way too cautious with the buffs, in this specific case them being quick with the changes and maybe getting them slightly wrong would still be an improvement over the current state of most specs' traits.</div></div><hr />

How does Laser Matrix not get value from stacking it? It's a very strong trait and loses nothing from being stacked. So each stack gives you consistent value(with the exception of the first being stronger inside Uldir). Thunderous Blast and DitB also have very consistent value when you stack more.<br />
Just because they don't get stronger for each trait doesn't mean they don't benefit from stacking. They benefit from stacking because they're strong traits and don't lose value after the first trait.</div></div><hr />

stacking means getting a benefit from using only the same trait which is only the case with very few traits and usually only in pvp to create more burst from a single spell by stacking Arcane Pressure or Shuriken Blades or whatever it is called..<br />
<br />
What you are saying is simply choosing to use good traits which is no different from stacking items with good secondary stats and is just the core mechanic of gear in the game and will always be the case.</div></div><hr />

No, stacking means using multiple of the same trait. It doesn't say anything about what that does to the value of each additional trait. You're also wrong about TB/DitB losing value for each additional trait, they have constant value.</div></div><hr />

They should know more because they've been trying for the last 15 years. :P<br />

<br />
Most of the DH traits are trash for Havoc. It's Revolving Blades at the top and then a bunch of non-exclusive traits after it.<br />
<br />
Vengeance has a couple decent ones.</div></div><hr />

Probably as to all intents and purposes this system, while similar to the Artifact system in Legion is completely new..</div></div><hr />

I remember how they used to tune abilities to few digits after zero. Now it's just fuckin 20%, 50%, 5% and other bullshit. Math is done by a gorilla.</div></div><hr />

Well he is 358 and 2/8 Mythic Uldir.<br />
<br />
I'd say he's doing quite good. And Resto isn't in that bad a state right now.<br />
<br />
There is literally no correlation to say that the Ele/Enhance small buff was because he mains one and is silly to suggest otherwise. He doesn't even main those 2 specs. Not to mention he has said countless times that class changes are not his area.</div></div><hr />

There's like 300 bloodly azerite traits and more are getting added every tier. There is absolutely no way that will be even possible to balance.</div></div><hr />

Yes, good thing there was no 400% buff for any trait, so I guess we are fine?</div></div><hr />

Nowhere near the worst. WoD still gets that honour imo.<br />
<br />
As for FF14. Decent game in it's own right but it's had it's own issue this expansion in the form of Eureka and everyone being absolutely livid at Square due them saying it would be new content and it's just mob/fate grinding.<br />
<br />
Not to mention they just went carrot on stick mode with it by putting our relic behind it.</div></div><hr />

Reading seems to be hard.<br />
Also looking up stuff on wowhead, so you know what that trait does, seems to be hard, too...<br />
<br />
wow, the dot got buffed from like 30 to 150dps or so... n1, that is indeed gamebreaking</div></div><hr />

Maybe not the worst but I think WoD at least lasted a little bit longer before we realized we were getting honeydicked. BfA didn't even release with folks already looking to 8.1 for further class improvements.<br />
<br />
The most bumpy release to be sure. We'll see whether or not Blizzard dumps it like WoD halfway through release or can really turn it around in 8.1.</div></div><hr />

Don't worry about the BfA apologists. I've played since Classic, this is the worst month of WoW I've ever experienced.<br />
<br />
I repeat, I've played since Classic. I've played every expansion. I've never had a problem with any of them until BfA. <br />
<br />
They tried too many &quot;new&quot; things. Azerite system is failing. Noble idea but it failed. Needs to be scrapped</div></div><hr />

Agree on that.<br />
<br />
They just need to start communicating and better have something decent to show today. And by decent I mean 8.1.<br />

<br />
In what area of where he quoted me am I being an &quot;apologist&quot; for BFA? I definitely don't think it's as bad as WoD. That would take a lot. <br />
<br />
WoD dedicated a damn major patch to models that should have been ready, a camera and Twitter integration. I mean if BFA does the same then I'll deem it as bad as WoD. But let's see what 8.1 brings.<br />
<br />
I've openly admitted to my issues with this expansion. I just think WoD is way worse imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Azerite system doesn't need to be scrapped...but definitely needs to be redesigned...it's not a horrible system...it's just, as it currently is, lazy....it's supposed to replace legendaries/set bonuses/artifact weapons and fails at it because it's supposed to replace too much. <br />
<br />
As far as the worst first month of an expansion...the only reason it feels this way is because it seems like they learned nothing from Legion's first month. Legion was a great expansion as a whole, but the first month was such a drag for so many. I didn't enjoy legion until i got the right legendaries which took about a month into nighthold to finally get. So at least we don't have to worry about that this time.<br />

Imagine having to wait till 8.1 to play your class because blizzard won't buff your spec. Shamans- *looks at thunderous blast nerfs* *sees no good buffs* . Nice game.<br />
<br />
My thought's exactly. guess im shelving my shaman until the redesign comes.</div></div><hr />
