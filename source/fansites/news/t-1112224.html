Noblegarden Comes to Azeroth<br />
Noblegarden (http://www.wowpedia.org/Noblegarden) begins on April 8th this year and will run until April 15th. This year brings a brand new reward, the Swift Springstrider (http://www.wowdb.com/items/72145), which can be purchased for Noblegarden Chocolate (http://www.wowdb.com/items/44791) x 500. The mount is also very rarely found inside the Brightly Colored Eggs (http://www.wowdb.com/items/45072).<br />
<br />

<br />
This year hasn't brought any changes to finding Brightly Colored Eggs (http://www.wowdb.com/items/45072). Horde players can find them in Brill, Bloodhoof Village, Falconwing Square, and Razor Hill. Alliance players can find eggs in Kharanos, Goldshire, Dolanaar, and Azure Watch. Don't forget to equip your Egg Basket (http://www.wowdb.com/items/45067) to speed up collection! <br />
<br />
All of the Noblegarden items can be found in one of the eggs, except for the Tome of Polymorph: Rabbit (http://www.wowdb.com/items/44793) and Noblegarden Egg (http://www.wowdb.com/items/44818). Don't forget to collect all of them items that you need to complete Noble Gardener (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/2798-noble-gardener#related:criteria-of) if you are going for the What A Long, Strange Trip It's Been (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/2145) achievement!<br />

Hunter Pet Skills<br />
Since the system is currently a little hard to ascertain in beta, I'll try and summarize the basics. Hopefully we'll have this working in a build or two.<br />
<br />
Every pet has 3 specs: Ferocity, Tenacity and Cunning. These work much like class specs, with a similar UI.<br />
Pets come with the spec you'd expect (Ferocity for kitties) but you can change it. If you want a tanking cat or a DPS crab, you can. If you have a favorite pet, you can just always use that one and swap the spec around.<br />
I hope to see A LOT of DPS crabs.<br />
Each spec comes with 2-3 active and 2-3 passive abilities. We took a careful look at what pet talents most hunters were taking and tried to take the best of those. Things like Roar of Sacrifice, Last Stand and Heart of the Phoenix made the cut.<br />
We didn't think we were getting a ton of gameplay out of the pet talents on live -- players interacted with them even less than the class talents -- and we didn't think pets needed the full tiered system like the Mists talent implementation, so we decided the best way to offer pet customization is to let hunters choose their pet mostly because of how it looks (and its one special ability) and not from its role.

Monk Animations for all Races<br />
All monks will have special animations. The animators started with the pandaren, since they had so many pandaren animations to create in the first place, but we are slowly getting them added to the existing races. More animations should show up each beta build. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/220298-monk-will-non-pandas-actually-roll/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4363778483?page=1#16))<br />
<br />
Brewmaster feedback<br />
Thanks for the feedback, everyone. Monks are a new class, and we will be iterating on them quite a bit and often we change mechanics a lot faster than we make beta builds. With that in mind, we wanted to clarify our design intent on some of the abilities:<br />
<br />
Dizzying Haze -- We increased the threat and lowered the energy. We're not crazy about making it do damage because then it risks competing with other Brewmaster abilities. We really don't want Dizzying Haze used rotationaly on single-targets. We also run into whether or not the ability should break CC if it does damage.<br />
<br />
AE tanking -- We agree that monks need a little more ability to cleave.<br />
<br />
Missing Jabs -- It isn't intended to lose all Energy on a miss. We will fix that.<br />
<br />
Our intent for Brewmasters is to use Guard, Purifying Brew and Shuffle as reactive and proactive abilities that you want to use to react or prevent damage spikes. We're not there yet with the cooldowns, durations and costs, which are the kinds of numbers we tune constantly after tests and playtests. Mechanically we think the pieces of the puzzle are there, but they don't fit together quite right yet.<br />
We agree that Chi generation is too slow for Brewmasters. Expel Harm is one possible Chi generator. Also keep in mind that there is currently a miss penalty on Energy and Chi that we plan on removing.<br />
We also agree that the Brewmaster procs still need a bit more spice.<br />
Free Tiger Palm is probably too strong.<br />
In our current builds, Brewmasters have a big health bonus, currently higher than any other tank. We're actively iterating on tanking numbers for all specs, but we need to consider a lot of different situations (single boss, groups, healers spamming, damage over long periods, different gear levels, etc.) (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/219841-monk-brewmaster-feedback/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4254456892?page=12#238))<br />
<br />
Mistweaver Feedback<br />
<br />
Mana regeneration and healing throughput is something that is still being tuned, so that will feel a bit off for a while longer.<br />
We had to tone down Mistweaver DPS. In our raid tests, they were contributing too much damage while still being effective healers.<br />
Chi Wave is something we're still tuning. The cooldown is now around 8 seconds, which may be too short. At the moment it accounts for half of the healing in raid situations.<br />
Jab and other DPS abilities scale with your weapon, and also with AP. The damage is normalized in such a way that any weapon choice is equal to the other, so weapons are an aesthetic choice. We'll probably have the DPS abilities scale with SP, as long as they're balanced.<br />
We've changed Mistweavers to also have a 1 second GCD as with the other two specializations.<br />
Can you explain more about the problem with a longer Soothing Mists? The mana per second is the same whether it's a short or long channel. Do you feel compelled to complete the channel? Clipping it should not incur a mana penalty.<br />
Cherry Mana Tea is intended to be &quot;sipped&quot; during break periods. Good Mistweavers will end a fight with as low mana as possible and as low Cherry Mana Tea stacks as possible. There are periods where you can't afford any breaks, but those vary by encounter. It should no longer break on taking damage. Stacks is something we are still iterating upon.<br />
We've changed Jasmine Tea to an upfront mana cost that will generate Chi over time (think &quot;Chi Tap&quot;). We're still iterating a lot on this design though. The intent is that the Mistweaver has an edge on precision healing, while the Windwalker has less control but can gain Chi quickly.<br />
Expel Harm only does damage if you &quot;effectively&quot; healed. If it's all overheal, no damage will happen. We intend for all monks to use the ability. Windwalkers can heal themselves.

Priest Feedback<br />
Did you realize you can take the individual buttons out of a &quot;pop out&quot; like Chakra and put them anywhere on your bar that you would like? We'll consider the stance bar implementation, but we want to get more players trying it first.<br />
<br />
What is the reason behind the increased mana cost for certain spells? Particularly holy word: chastise which on live costs about 7.8k but in beta it's around 15k. Also, mass dispell's mana cost shot up to 45k, which is almost half of the finite mana pool that priests now have. <br />
Chastise is probably an oversight. Off the top of my head, I can't imagine why it would need to be more expensive. Mass Dispel is expensive because under the new dispel model, it is very powerful. We want priests to use normal dispel some instead of letting Mass solve every problem.<br />
<br />
Also, would you consider removing the mana cost for power infusion? Most of the newer priest talents (save the top tier talents) like void shift, etc. use cooldowns rather than mana. <br />
Power Infusion probably doesn't need a cost. I'll discuss it with the team.<br />
<br />
P.S. I should add that we completed a big audit of heals (for all classes) recently, and concluded that the mana costs were reasonable for the most part but that the heals were much too small for the Mists health pools. We buffed all of the heals quite a bit. We want mana to be less painful than it was at the start of Cataclysm, but we want it to matter more than it did at the end of Cataclysm. We want the slope of the line to be less steep -- your higher throughput and regen in later patches will still make heals more efficient overall, just less so than they became in Dragon Soul. The static mana pool helps a lot with that.

Enhancement Damage<br />
It is worth pointing out that one of our goals is for nobody's damage to drop when you convert your Cataclysm level 85 character to a Mists level 85 character. The sources of your damage may change as rotations change somewhat, but once you're comfortable with those new rotations, your damage should be similar.<br />
<br />
Also remember that number tuning is one of the last things we do. There is no point in spending hours testing numbers if we decide that a particular ability or mechanic was a boneheaded idea and needs to be redesigned. We try to keep the numbers sane enough that players still feel like they can give feedback though.

Ranged Attack for Melee Classes<br />
Rogues and warriors will have a baseline &quot;Throw&quot; attack, that does a tiny bit of damage but mostly serves just to get a creature's attention. This attack will not require a ranged weapon.

Tanks and Expertise<br />
We want tanks to care about hit and expertise as mitigation stats, because hitting a boss leads to resources, which leads to higher survival. We could make gear with just parry, dodge and mastery (and just dodge and mastery for some tanks) but we think that gets boring. You might not necessarily need to cap hit and expertise, depending on how much avoidance or mastery you'd be talking about sacrificing. That's not the kind of tuning we have completed yet. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/220294-save-the-tanks/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4365747926?page=3#52))<br />
<br />
Protection Feedback<br />
There is always a risk of jumping into a thread like this to only touch on a couple of points that it will derail what is a pretty interesting discussion. However, I did want to respond to a few things.<br />
<br />
1) We still think the overall design of tanks attacking in order to build up resources for defenses is a sound one. In a world where threat isn't hard to maintain beyond the first few seconds, we believe tanks would quickly grow uninterested in their rotation if it wasn't tied to defense. (The reasons we don't think managing threat is fun gameplay after the first few seconds is something I've gone into before, so I won't belabor the point here.)<br />
<br />
2) We agree with the feedback that warriors, and to a lesser extent paladins, aren't getting enough out of their block abilities (Shield Block and SotR). We erred on the side of making them forgiving so that tanks wouldn't worry about splatting if they failed to use one of those attacks, but we think now we were too conservative, to the point that they don't feel (to use a word many posters have used) visceral. You should notice a change in incoming damage when you use these abilities. So we are trying the following changes. Let us know how they feel.<br />
<br />
<br />
The next iteration of Shield Block we are going to try is that it blocks ALL attacks for 6 sec. Furthermore, those blocks have a chance to become critical blocks, which keeps mastery relevant.<br />
We think Shield of the Righteous needs less tweaking since it already has a damage component; it is noticeable when it gets used. However, to make sure it also provides survivability, the initial automatic block will reduce 75% of damage while any subsequent blocks during the 6 sec duration will block for 50% of damage. (A normal block is 30%.) Those numbers are subject to iteration, but again the idea is that mastery will still affect SotR's mitigation.<br />
We also agree that the Guardian druid combination of mastery and Savage Defense feels too passive in comparison with the plate tanks. We are going to change Savage Defense to a chance to avoid damage, which gives it more parity with say the warrior. The warrior has a reliable block, but a more random mastery, while the druid has a reliable mastery, with a more random &quot;block.&quot; To partially offset this change, Frenzied Regen will do all of its healing instantly.<br />
<br />
3) We understand that as players, you want to minimize the randomness of tanking. That makes you good tanks. But as designers, we have to make sure that randomness has its place. Randomness is one of the challenges in the game -- by design -- that you need to overcome. Tanking with randomness eliminated would be static and repetitive. You wouldn't have &quot;oh snap&quot; moments where you or a healer had to use a cooldown. You could probably predict from that first boss swing whether you'd win or lose the fight, since every swing would feel about the same way. Of course we don't want tanking to be brutally frustrating, but we don't want it to be effective yet boring either.<br />
<br />
4) We also understand that long-term Protection warriors aren't yet feeling that frenetic, button mashy playstyle with which they have become familiar. We are experimenting with a new proc, currently called Ultimatum, in which Devastate has a chance to make the next Heroic Strike or Cleave free. We don't want to return Devastate to Sword and Board however. Shield Slam (and therefore Sword and Board) provide rage, which is a mitigation resource now. Having Devastate lead to better mitigation would mean you had to prioritize the no-cooldown Devastate above other attacks such as Storm Bolt. Hopefully the Ultimatum implementation will deliver that &quot;fish for procs&quot; feeling of the old Sword and Board, while giving offtanks a more dynamic rotation (since they can't rely on Revenge).<br />
<br />
5) We don't think it's critical that all tanks have the same number and character of cooldowns. In fact, we think doing so would make all of the tanks play too similarly when what we actually want to do is give them each their own character, provided each can still tank any content in the game with a reasonably similar amount of effort. We give everyone a Last Stand and Shield Wall equivalent and try to have another option or two. It's okay that Blood DKs have a lot of cooldowns -- that has always been a DK thing -- as long as they aren't much more effective than other tanks. <br />
<br />
While I agree with the idea, its a little extreme. Druids have a full 7 CDs and SD, DK's still have a ton. Warriors are stuck with SW, and Rallying Cry, which normally gets raid priority. <br />
Rallying Cry and Last Stand no longer share a cooldown. You can use Rallying Cry to help the raid or to help yourself as a mini Last Stand.<br />
<br />
This brings Druids and Warriors closer together, but Paladins will be left in the dust with this change. Warriors will be block capped while still having a chance to block for more than Paladins (other than the initial block after using SotR). I really like the concept of shield tanks block capping with their active mitigation up, but Paladins need to get similar treatment.<br />
We're only talking about 6 sec though. That's not many boss attacks. The optimal situation for the warrior is around 3 attacks that do 60% less damage, while for the paladin it is 1 attack at 75% and 2 attacks at 50%. The worst situation for the warrior will be 3 attacks at 30% and the worst situation for the paladin will be 1 attack at 75%. The chance of the paladin having the worst case situation should be lower though, and if two unblocked attacks back to back can kill you, then the encounter is probably overtuned (because what happens when you don't have Shield of the Righteous available?)<br />
<br />
In addition, paladins have a potent self-heal in Word of Glory and a paladin at 5 Holy Power can probably generate a new Holy Power for a second cooldown (5 - 3 + 1 = 3) faster than a warrior at 100 rage can generate 20 rage for a second cooldown (100 - 60 + 20 = 60). The numbers may not be perfect yet, but they seem within the realm of tuning. <br />
<br />
And there's the not impossible chance that when all is said and done, the RNG is being unkind and you're plumb out of buttons to hit. Then what? You die and get told it's &quot;fun&quot;?<br />
RNG is often unkind, but you should always have sufficient tools (as a group) to handle it. The application of those tools to the problem at hand is one of the things that separates good guilds from great ones. If you are dependent on the tank getting lucky to survive then you're probably doing content too difficult for your group (which you can often solve by improving your gear) or we screwed up the encounter tuning somewhere along the way (which you can often solve by going to the forums).<br />
<br />
So.. instead of automatically randomly procing Savage Defense, I must hit a button so that maybe I will have a Savage Defense proc? Huh?<br />
In a nutshell, but that's really the equivalent of the warrior hitting Shield Block and hoping that all of that mastery gives her a critical block, while your armor from mastery is always reliable.<br />
<br />
Part of the reason the druid mechanics worked out as they did is that we needed to make haste and crit reasonable survival stats, since they appear on druid gear.<br />
<br />
Again, don't confuse &quot;As a player, I want to minimize RNG to make myself a better tank&quot; with &quot;The designers should minimize RNG because that makes me a better tank.&quot; I'd wager you'd be bored if combat was that predictable.

anyone care to put in a GM ticket for those Venture Co. goblins? pretty sure gdkp'ing a mine to two different factions (and they both paid right?) is against the ToU.<br />

Doubt it, since the last MMO-C news post had Nightwing and the RAF III as separate mounts. Nightwing seems like it will be either JC like the gemmed panthers, or Alchy since it turns you into the mount like the Sandstone Drake.</div></div><hr />

A mix of enchanting and JC? JC, cuts a volcanic glass heart thingie, hands it to an enchanter and POFF, you got an enchanted heart turning you into a dragon or what ever it is? :)</div></div><hr />

However, to make sure it also provides survivability, the initial automatic block will reduce 75% of damage while any subsequent blocks during the 6 sec duration will block for 50% of damage. (A normal block is 30%.) Those numbers are subject to iteration, but again the idea is that mastery will still affect SotR's mitigation.<br />
<br />
I'll have to get on an try this. It 'sounds' like it'll be a nice boost, but I'm still a bit worried about the magic damage that we can potentially take. =\</div></div><hr />

<br />
On a serious note though: the line &quot;Part of the reason the druid mechanics worked out as they did is that we needed to make haste and crit reasonable survival stats, since they appear on druid gear&quot; makes me sad, I guess we WONT be seeing Tank Leather for Guardian Druids and Brewmaster Monks? Seems a little silly, afterall how will Tiersets work out? Will tier sets still be poorly Itemised (Crit and Haste on Tank gear) just because that's the kind of gear Guardian/Brewmasters are used to, or will Tier gier have decent stats on, and become instant BiS due to higher survivability from correct itemisation?<br />
<br />
It seems bizarre to me that for example Holy Paladins, or Caster Shammy get gear made specifically for them, when there's only 1 or 2 specs that use the gear, while Tank Leather wearers, of which there are also 2 specs, are forced to use subpar gear? What was the point of seperating Feral and Guardian, if Guardian will still be using poorly itemised offset and tier gear?</div></div><hr />

<br />
And he began his posting spree back in the beta for WotLK, back when half of the gamer populace thought he was a woman. :P<br />
<br />
On an unrelated note, I've come to a realization about the farming that you're going to be able to do in the game (I was spurred to this realization by the introduction of the Farmer title, which leads me to think that this is going to be a serious undertaking for players). I think it's going to be a necessary activity to get about half of the cooking ingredients you're going to need for some of the more important feast recipes.<br />
<br />
I mean look at some of the materials listed back at this post under cooking (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2720-Mists-of-Pandaria-Profession-Changes-Blue-Posts-The-Daily-Blink):<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Black Pepper<br />
Mogu Pumpkin<br />
Ox Ribs<br />
100 Year Soy Sauce<br />
Sirloin Steak<br />
White Turnip<br />
Pink Turnip<br />
Aged Pink Turnip<br />
Tender Brisket<br />
Minced Meat<br />
Pheasant Breast<br />
Forest Boar Meat<br />
Raw Tiger Steak<br />
Scallions<br />
Tough Wolf Flank<br />
Goat Chops<br />
Juicycrunch Carrot<br />
Rice Flour<br />
Red Blossom Leek<br />
Yak Flanks<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Italicized are the ones that have no obvious killable thing associated with them, and I assume that with the farming mini-activities you can possibly set up plots to receive a number of these vegetables each day (5-7) or week (20?). Of course there's the potential that I assume you can get some sort of sub-currency to purchase more vegetables beyond what you could be rewarded daily.... not unlike how the Northern spices worked in WotLK, a system I prefer to rather than having to rely on an otherwise-unassociated profession (Inscription) to make my BIS food.<br />
<br />
I like my idea. I'm going to hope it's true. We'll see what the beta brings. :)</div></div><hr />

Long posts, very opinionated posts. But i've come to this certain realization. WoW has, with MoP, become another entity. Where before, it was WoW on a downward slide, it is now something more. It's WoW 2.0 or WoW Worldwide. It is now the entryway into other mmo's, into gaming, into the possibilities of the connected world of gaming to be more exact. At this point, it is a legitimate collection of scenarios, such as walking down the alley of a fair. Individualized hallways of content, great snippets of content. Think of Wario-ware. That is wow today...and frankly, where it doesn't occupy the &quot;sit down with a nice tall glass of rum+coke, ignore the rest of the world, sink myself into a solid 4 hours of heroic raiding / serious pvping&quot; image that I wished it would be, it is the &quot;Sit down with a beer, chill out, do 30min-1hr of fun/casual stuff&quot; type of game. They have their own merits.<br />
<br />
The &quot;casual&quot; side of my gaming livelihood is very crowded though. You see, under my way of thinking, as I somewhat devoted gamer, I split certain amounts of my gaming into little sectors...some my core &quot;loves&quot; (snes rpgs, realism fps's, deep mechanic puzzle games, some to stay current with casual and modern titles (BF3, Tribes, SWTOR) , some to delve deep into hardcore offerings(dwarf fortress, Path of Exile (awesome game btw)). Those modern games, those casual games, I've got a limited space for. I need that time as a gamer for the other stuff...its who &quot;I&quot; am as a gamer. When I dream of cool gaming stuff (and that's something I do btw), I dream of moments in those deep hardcore titles... not the fun (but casual) forgettable stuff. That's what separates good from great. The product from the art. ANYWAYS, I DIGRESS... WoW has gone from a fallen mmo ... from a bad casual game... to a legitimate casual game. And I may just jump back into things if that same presentation of content becomes cheaper... but as it stands, wow has become so instanced that it is barely &quot;massive&quot; in the definition... It should be 1/4th the cos to sub, just as their cost to operate has dropped significantly, as has their frequency of content updates.<br />

<br />
TLDR: ITS NOT WOW ANYMORE, BUT IT IS SOMETHING ELSE THAT IS SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO BE ITS OWN GAME.<br />

You are pretty correct, that's why I don't recognize it anymore. I liked the old grindy aspect of it from TBC/Classic and that's why I devoted so much damned time to it. But that was also when they had only a few million subscribers and the majority of the players were not only nerds in real life, they were dedicated gamers. Yeah, I'm a geek from hell, I can go back to graph paper and pencils, so it's in my nature. But...<br />
<br />
It's not in the current demographic's nature to play games like what we saw in Classic and TBC. It's big business now, so they shuffle the die hards aside and call it quality of life enhancements. Good for them, it makes them money. If you don't like it do as I and my friends did, vote with your wallet. There are multiple titles out there that are (from my standpoint at least) tailored to appeal to people like myself. WoW is essentially the training wheels of MMOs anymore, which is good. It makes the genre popular and people that used to laugh at me in grade school are accepting it as mainstream today. Maybe once they learn how to do it here, they can try to upgrade in a different game.<br />
<br />
Also, when you have 10 million subs, you structure your company to support it. They aren't exactly interested in writing pink slips either. It's a survival thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, 500 chocolates for the mount - is it worth it? The Swift Love Bird took me a couple of hours of farming including cleaning out Throne of the Tides for a nice farming spot. With my luck I'll probably get the mount to drop in my 498th egg or something...</div></div><hr />

There's no logic in your post. Just subjective ideas about what it &quot;should be&quot; or what it &quot;used to be&quot;. The context of your own experiences playing this game do not automatically relate to others. I mean the purist way to look at it is that after the very first patch in Vanilla it was &quot;no longer WOW&quot;. Get over it. It's cool to post you opinions in forum/site like this, but just label them your opinions, not some crappy logic thing.</div></div><hr />

Where did I use or imply anything like that?<br />
<br />
You sound like an idiot frankly. WoW isn't the wow it once was anymore. You simply cannot deny that. It's not a literal &quot;its been patched therefore its different&quot; 10 year child logic that you're implying. It's a significant departure that has come over a very long period. I don't know what exactly you have a problem with in my post, which was just me making a post, but I feel what I said has some very heavy ground to stand on.<br />
<br />
Thinking about it...you know what, fuck you, what I said is in fact correct and stand by it as the final word on the state of the game. I have spoken and no other discussion is allowed about it anymore, unless I say so. WoW isn't wow anymore. It's not a traditional mmo, as it once was, it's something wildly different. In LK and Cata it tried to hold onto that traditional mmo shell, but with MoP they're just dropping it altogether. Go fuck yourself, because i said so.<br />

That's a good way to look at it, and certainly less frustrating than trying to think of it as a version of vanilla/BC-era WoW. (Because you're right, it isn't anymore.) What just blows my mind is trying to figure out why anyone would want to do something like that to a game that had 12 million players.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, we've got the most successful and profitable video game in history!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but it obviously sucks, so let's turn it into a completely different game!&quot;<br />

Hitting 80 being able to gear myself at a decent speed. I enjoyed ICC it was fun yet not to challenging. The when Cata came I bought the special edition thinking like oh this going to to be fun. Hit 85 in less than 5 days...then the hell begins....2hr heroics, less than acceptable gear raiding almost impossible for 2 months in a non hardcore guild. Nothing to do but waist my time on archeology. Quit for a month, play League of legends, come back..do a few uninteresting raids that still people are bad at. Molten core comes out hurray i actually did the hylas quests im ahead of the game....month of doing boring quests and raids barely can down anything. I'm done.....Hear about pandas....Nope never coming back... hear about pokemon...nope never coming back....hear about the dragonflight losing there powers....what the hell is wrong with you blizzard never coming back....hear about Tyreal mount....I want the stupid pet nope sorry you arent getting a years worth out of me......hear about 6 talent points......wha tha hell?..........I'm sorry but 6 talent points really blizzard...I dont give a crap about your reasons for doing it it stupid and pathetic you really thing its going to be more diverse no 6 spell you can choose from onyl six will be just right per spec your jsut lazy and dont want to have to make adjustment to 80 talents of even 40. Im sorry but enjoy looking though that talents to decide whats best for me...oh six wow looks like only these 6 spells will truly be usuful... sorry the 6 talent points were my last straw. Those who continue to follow blizzard you are nothing but sheep that follow what ever blizzard tells you. There are far more interesting mmos out there, dont give blizzard any more money for the crap they are giving us.</div></div><hr />
