<br />
Not like they weren't asked about this during Blizzcon 2013 and 2014. <br />
<br />
But yeah, my typical WoW day consists of logging in to my main and alts, doing missions, farming herbs and ores (on two of them), doing all their daily profession cooldowns, queueing their professions work orders. For my two 100's, it's also queueing bunker work orders and barn work orders, then twice a week picking up the default garrison resource pile which maxes at 500 in approx 3.5 days. By the time I'm done with all that it's typically time to log off, so outside leveling my 2 100's and weekend play, the rest of my wow time is played solely within the walls of my many garrisons. :(</div></div><hr />

This is what you do Blizzard. Have an idea, then think to yourself: How will altoholic's like this? Once you have your answer then ask yourself: Do we (Blizz) care or is this how we want the experience to be. Just do this every time you have a new idea and you will stop having to fix Golden Lotus dailies at launch, Garrisons, etc.</div></div><hr />

But yeah, my typical WoW day consists of logging in to my main and alts, doing missions, farming herbs and ores (on two of them), doing all their daily profession cooldowns, queueing their professions work orders. For my two 100's, it's also queueing bunker work orders and barn work orders, then twice a week picking up the default garrison resource pile which maxes at 500 in approx 3.5 days. By the time I'm done with all that it's typically time to log off, so outside leveling my 2 100's and weekend play, the rest of my wow time is played solely within the walls of my many garrisons. :(<br />
<br />
What forces you to collect ore/herbs? The price is so low it is waste of time to do it. In WoD you can easily get 5k/h gold so why bother with some tedious herb/ore farming?</div></div><hr />

He probably means from his Garrison mine/herb garden.

I have at least 2 Engineers/JCers/Scribes/blacksmiths and an Alchemist who need ore/herbs for their profession CD's and work orders on top of actually crafting stuff I find myself running out of ore/herbs and having to log over to alts with trading posts to get more.</div></div><hr />

And again, collecting ore/herbs, whether it is from your Garrison or just good old school farming, is so inefficient I'm puzzled why people do it. The price of one ore/herb is barely 1g. There are so many way to make gold and then buy all ore/herb you need.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lots of reasons. Maybe they don't know how to make gold, maybe they are new to the game, maybe they have strong convictions against purchasing something they can make/farm on their own, maybe they just don't want to go to Warspear to use the AH, maybe they believe there is going to be some kind of change in the future and ore/herbs will skyrocket in price, maybe they just don't want to buy peoples stuff because they don't want to make someone happy their auction sold.<br />
<br />
For me, I'm not always going to do the stuff is takes to make gold so I won't always have gold but I'll always do my garrison stuff. If I spend my gold on buying junk off the AH I could run into a point where I don't have enough gold for repairs (it's happened) or whatever else I'd rather spend my gold on.</div></div><hr />

I have 9600 gold, had 11k earlier but I bought some of those stat reroll things. I level with the intention of being 100 so I skip a lot of quests and I never vendor any gear because I need to DE everything for dust for work orders and daily CD's (remember 5 enchanters) but every alt has the enchanting building and I still never have enough dust.

Setup 2 or 3 alts at level 92 with the trading post, buy draenic dust whenever it is priced at below 30 GR per 5. That's what I do. Every other day the alts have about 400 GR to spend.</div></div><hr />

And i love the Ashran change! 20 sec to accept was way to short!<br />
<br />
Happy people for like no reason. A.) DKs aren't above and beyond overpowered comparatively to any other class to warrant any excessive nerfing, but I imagine the &quot;happy people&quot; don't competitively PvE or PvP or they would notice this:<br />

I have 9 100's and 9 lvl 3 garrisons. Maintaining the garrisons is simply too lucrative. I am just accruing resources, and not selling anything except some BOE's that come from salvage crates, in anticipation of garrison nerfs.<br />
<br />
My one wish is that if you assign a follower to mines or herbs that you wouldnt have to actually mine or gather those nodes, and they would be in the resource bin along with the work order stuff. That alone would save me quite a bit of time each day.<br />

<br />
And yet the supply means that people are doing exactly that.<br />
That supply you rely upon for such a low price is only that due to people doing the very thing you are telling people not to do.<br />
Rather counter-productive I thought.<br />
It is a good start in that work orders can wait, and will simply &quot;stack&quot;, but the daily gathering I feel could do with a similar mechanism.<br />
The daily profession cooldown I believe will gain upto 3 charges if not used on consecutive days.<br />
Plus the mine is a lot more tedious than the herb garden.<br />
<br />
Something to reduce the daily grind requirement, without increasing the supply wouldn't be a bad thing.<br />
<br />
Maybe assign the follower to do a daily &quot;gather&quot; for a reduced yield or a cost.<br />
I think that would appeal to a lot of people.</div></div><hr />

For me, I just do it over coffee in the morning before I go to work. I don't really have time to really play the game in the morning, so I do some garrison maintenance for the day while I'm still half asleep and the caffeine is entering my system. I wouldn't be doing anything productive with my time anyway, so clearing resources from a couple of garrisons, doing some profession cd's and turning over missions is a nice quiet way to start my day. I don't stress it if I don't get my mines cleared everyday, but if I'm just lolling about in the morning, what else is there to do.</div></div><hr />

Right now, heroics are challenging when collecting gear, and kind of quick to run through, at decent gearlevels, when you only need the garrison resources or the bags of goodies. You can still screw up pretty bad if not dispelling or interrupting or you standing in bad stuff, which is exactly what heroic dungeons are supposed to be like - in my opinion.<br />
Sure, nerf the normal dungeons, but not heroics or CMs. Sorry for rant<br />
I totally agree with this. Finally some challenge in the heroics. (Not that they are hard, but it takes less to screw up.)</div></div><hr />

The ridiculous scaling of gear makes it impossible to keep the challange beyond a couple of weeks. Sad, sad times. One day Blizzard will realize that multiple difficulties and multiple levels of gear within the same tier is what shortens the lifespan of the content, by the simple virtue of being able to over gear anything thrown at us within weeks.</div></div><hr />
