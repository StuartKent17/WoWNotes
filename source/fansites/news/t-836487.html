Guild Reputation changes<br />
I talked with the designers late last night and early this morning on the rep system. There are some improvements being discussed but any changes made would at the earliest, be seen in the first major content patch, if not after. For that reason they aren't changes we're willing to yet discuss as they haven't been implemented, but there is some agreement that additional ways to earn rep, as well as help for PvP'ers and PvP guilds is in order.<br />
<br />
Future improvements aside, one basic point we kept coming back to while discussing it was the nature of the system, and the intent and vision for how it should be a part of someone's play time when they log in. First and foremost it is not a system we want to encourage people to grind out by making certain activities either give rep, or give more of it. We realize that this is contrary to what is possible for most NPC rep factions, but this isn't an NPC rep, and it's deliberately different. Secondly, and most importantly, we are ok with this continuing to be a very slow moving rep that you can't quickly progress. These are bonuses, and not requirements to ensure a fun or properly progressing gameplay experience. The gain of guild rep is something that is intended to happen slowly over time, and not something you can focus your efforts on to push toward the cap as quick as possible. Obviously there are ways to make it quicker, and actions you can take to try to build it up, but as many of you are aware they still aren't always extremely lucrative. This is intentional.<br />
<br />
To reiterate my first paragraph, we do have some improvements planned in the way of adding or improving the way rep is gained in certain situations. We do not however feel the system is performing beneath or beyond the intent and design, and are mostly happy with the rate in which it's being gained. Slowly but surely. <br />

Lunar Festival is Nigh<br />
Lunar Festival starts during the week-end and I will update if there is anything new. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Lunar Festival (http://www.wowpedia.org/Lunar_festival) on Wowpedia (http://www.wowpedia.org/Lunar_festival)<br />
Lunar Festival Elders (http://www.wowpedia.org/Lunar_Festival_Elders) on Wowpedia (http://www.wowpedia.org/Lunar_Festival_Elders)<br />
<br />
<br />
“Every year the druids of Moonglade hold a celebration of their city’s great triumph over an ancient evil. During the Lunar Festival, citizens of Azeroth have the opportunity to honor their elders by celebrating their sage wisdom, sharing in magnificent feasts, and of course…shooting fireworks!”<br />
<br />
Join in the celebration as Lunar Festival kicks off not with a whimper, but with a BANG on Sunday, January 23. Seek out the elders throughout Azeroth and receive their wisdom... as well as a token of their gratitude. Gather these Ancient Coins to purchase festive attire or the recipes to craft outfits of your own. <br />
<br />
It’s not all fireworks and dancing in the moonlight, however. Omen, defeated so many centuries ago, yet remains in Lake Elune'ara. Although driven insane by the Burning Legion, the demi-god still possesses Elune's blessing and is, hence, immortal. During the Lunar Festival, he stirs... and heroes of the land are called to defeat him once again.<br />
<br />
Festivities end Saturday, February 12.<br />

Blue Posts<br />
Just hit the ilvl for heroics today!<br />
I believe that this is very much at the heart of the issue, and I hope that you'll reconsider your stance.<br />
<br />
Essentially, while you may have crossed the barrier that kept you from entering a heroic instance, that doesn't necessarily mean that your character is quite ready for those encounters until you've accrued more gear. It might be easier to view the minimum item level as a way of preventing those who have little hope of success from queuing, rather than carte blanche for assured victory once you hit the threshold.<br />
<br />
If you're willing, you might find it beneficial to spend a little bit more time in regular dungeons, as well as acquiring reputation items or crafted gear, before you pass final judgment on whether healing is the right path for you in Cataclysm. After you're wearing gear that's a bit more appropriate to the challenge that the content presents, you might even find it fun. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/153045/i-give-up-healingi-triedi-really-tried))<br />
<br />
This just proves what most of us have been saying all along; Either Heroics need to be easier or that cap needs to be pushed way up.<br />
Like I said, the cap exists to prevent those with little hope of success from entering heroic instances - not to prevent anyone who might not be ready from facing them. Players with appropriate gear who meet the minimum requirements do have the capability to succeed, though that success might not come easily. For those who are having a frustrating experience, I don't think it's untoward to counsel gear. Gearing up a bit more before tackling heroics is probably a good bet, as it stands to help make their time in those instances more enjoyable. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/153045/i-give-up-healingi-triedi-really-tried))<br />
<br />
Healing &quot;nerf&quot; in Cataclysm<br />
Healing was so good, and so efficient, toward the end of Wrath of the Lich King that healing wasn't a challenge for a geared player. Healers were able to make up for any number of mistakes made by their group, and almost never ran out of mana.<br />
<br />
That isn't a direction that we are comfortable continuing in since it obviated choices in the healing process, allowed players to effectively ignore encounter mechanics and, dare I say it, minimized skill as a component in healing.<br />
<br />
While there may be opposing perceptions of the results, I don't think it's laziness by anyone's standards to put thought, care and work into tuning a game to create a challenging but 'winnable' experience. I believe it would have been laziness to maintain the status quo. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/153045/i-give-up-healingi-triedi-really-tried))</div></div><hr />

Although that is true for this PARTICULAR fight according to wowprogress the furthest anyone is in 10 man is 6/13 whereas 25 has twice that many bosses down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah the general consensus from most of the top world guilds is that most of the 10m heroics are crazy overtuned for the gear lvl. I believe Ensidia went back to 25m progression because it was faster then 10 which they started out doing.</div></div><hr />

Which could just mean that the top progression guilds in the world stuck to 25man. There are plenty of valid interpretations, including that 10 mans are harder.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Top progression guilds stop caring about progression and would go 25 man if it were harder than 10 man? Not frickin likely.</div></div><hr />

I just ran a heroic with a guildy healer earlier and she basically failed. I know she's a good player, but it wasn't going too well. I really wanna try this new healing model, it's sounds very fun. The healer will begin to be the soul of the group, not the tank. If the healer is having issues, the other classes need to help, it isn't all on the healer anymore.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Why does anyone really care about world firsts and stuff? Well, I don't even watch the super bowl, I actually hate most sports, especially ones that show up on TV, so maybe I just don't have a world first caring type of personality. I would LOVE to be part of Paragon though; I'm fairly certain that I could hang with the big boys if my time allowed.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure a top guild focused on progressing through the hard modes of encounters would do everything it could to beat those encounters- including changing the toggle from 10 to 25 to 10 depending on what was easier. Judging by wowprogress, it seems like the majority of hard modes are more difficult in 10-man.<br />
<br />
Getting world first in the 10-man version of sinestra/cho'gall/whoever will still be an accomplishment, but I suppose now it's mostly a race to see who can get 13/13 the fastest.</div></div><hr />

they would take the easiest route.. and that route is 25 man..<br />

some heroic 10 man fights could actually be mathematically impossible at their gear level. and i assume that is in their dictionary.</div></div><hr />

Ever tried healing LK hero? Oh yeah hyper easy when whole raid gets smashed and one healer is inside the chamber... Now you turned it around... just the healing process without any boss abilities is hard, try not to run out of mana I dare you and heal as good as a paladin when you're any other class...<br />
<br />
But ok Blizz, healing now in your mind should require the same amount of skill as any other raid role right? Ok so I switched to dps... God this is easy... just stay on the rotation and avoid bosses abilities... I'm sorry but I think, JUST a small thought that keeping a rotation in your head and watching boss abilities is a bit less hard to remember than mana-efficient healing rotation + all boss's abilities + watching all the people's HP and where they are AND if they will get hit in a second or not... just sayin'...</div></div><hr />

Now that i think about it, i did do a couple of quests down in Uldum aswell so you might have to complete 100 daily quests to cap you guild-reputation for the week.<br />

<br />
From what I can gather from the recount in ss1 and look of the characters in ss2, their comp looked something like:<br />
<br />
1xWarlock (Affliction)<br />
2xDeath Knights (Unholy (both))<br />
2xPaladin (Prot and Holy)<br />
1xShaman (resto/elem (hard to tell but presumably resto))<br />
2xDruid (feral(dps) and resto)<br />
1xMage (fire)<br />
1xRogue (assassination)<br />
<br />
As far as specs, I matched name with guild roster on wowprogress.com and went from there.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Missing 10th was a rogue.<br />
Word of Caution: Take my comp guide with a grain of salt, due to the colors in the ss and the smooshed characters on grid, it's really hard to get a real feel for everyone's name.<br />

<br />
Healing heroics can be scary at first for sure and I would def agree there are some people that need to spend more time in regulars before moving on... remember when we had to unlock heroics by running the regulars over and over and over...... and over o.O ? It's probably people like this that have had that experience of running a crazy amount of regular BC dungeons to finally get into heroics and then run heroics a crazy amount before even thinking about raiding that are not having problems in Cata.</div></div><hr />

Ever tried healing LK hero? Oh yeah hyper easy when whole raid gets smashed and one healer is inside the chamber... Now you turned it around... just the healing process without any boss abilities is hard, try not to run out of mana I dare you and heal as good as a paladin when you're any other class...<br />
<br />
But ok Blizz, healing now in your mind should require the same amount of skill as any other raid role right? Ok so I switched to dps... God this is easy... just stay on the rotation and avoid bosses abilities... I'm sorry but I think, JUST a small thought that keeping a rotation in your head and watching boss abilities is a bit less hard to remember than mana-efficient healing rotation + all boss's abilities + watching all the people's HP and where they are AND if they will get hit in a second or not... just sayin'...<br />

We weren't a world first looking type of a guild at time though. Yogg0 was our first real top 3 kill and there was something that did prevent us from doing Yogg0 and that was having 25 active raiders and not the right setup for Yogg0 (we and everyone + mothers had the tactic for this fight. Taunt the adds that get buffed away from the others. It was just the setup requirement and actual execution that made the fight hard). Luckily we had just recruited 9 dudes from Underground Kosmonavts but they were still leveling up after having to reroll from alliance to horde.<br />
<br />
We started working on Yogg after Exodus killed it and everyone thought it was legit. During the same week we geared up the fastest levelers from the rerollers and set to work. 5 days later the boss was dead.<br />
<br />
Stars was first though and they did deserve that kill after wiping weeks on it.</div></div><hr />

Dream guild and Bluesea guild from the TW servers are fully sponsored teams. Their members gets full time salary plus housing and food. (although it's not very much, and they obviously have to play a certain amount of hours everyday even when not doing progression, to sell instance runs and loots) Of course, WoW raiding isn't the only thing they participate competitively. They also do WoW PvP, SC2 and other FPS.<br />

Also, Dream guild isn't exactly new to WoW raiding. Most of their members were previously from The7, who competed with Stars for regional first in China and Taiwan since the Vanilla era.</div></div><hr />

That's one thing Blizzard really needs a rap over the knuckles for, their absolute refusal (for the most part) to bring change to their holiday events, keeping them fresh, instead of just rolling out the same tired old stale events year after year.

I just ran a heroic with a guildy healer earlier and she basically failed. I know she's a good player, but it wasn't going too well. I really wanna try this new healing model, it's sounds very fun. The healer will begin to be the soul of the group, not the tank. If the healer is having issues, the other classes need to help, it isn't all on the healer anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm so surprised at all these complaints about how difficult healing is. I started my very first healer, a paladin, in Cataclysm. He's now ilvl 346 and I don't find it &quot;hard&quot; at all to heal in heroics. I play with my brother, a tank, who knows what he's doing. I know what I'm doing and we usually have 1 DPS who knows what he's doing. The other 2 spots we pug. <br />
On some occasions it can get pretty close, where someone nearly dies. And that's about the extent of &quot;healing difficulty&quot; to me: Someone -nearly- dying in heroics. If I have to pop Lay on Hands, I consider myself or someone else having fucked up. If a DPS did die during a heroic run, doesn't need to be a wipe, then I consider that a poorly played heroic. And this is before the first content patch! I can't imagine how boring it's going to become again when we have access to epics for heroics. <br />
<br />
I really really hope that Blizzard won't give in to these endless cries about how &quot;difficult&quot; this game has become for healers because it's not. In fact, I really wish they'd include a higher than heroic difficulty level because 1 content patch from now I'll be bored, and I'm sure a lot of people that know what they're doing will be too. <br />
<br />
One big mistake I see a lot of (paladin)healers make is terrible mana management. For example, tons of them don't use judgement when it's off CD. Judgement is a pally's main mana regen tool, it heals you and it boosts your haste, with the proper talents. I can't believe some players just neglect it.<br />
Another poor way of conserving mana is when a group is dmged to 50% HP. I see a lot of Paladins spamming flash heal on everyone because they panic and want to get them up quickly instead of using divine light, or even holy light for which they probably have the time too. <br />
<br />
Right now it's a lot of fun to heal, I find myself playing the char more than my main DPS nowadays.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Either way 90% of the healers and tanks who were actively doing random heroics in Wrath quit playing wow, or it's so hard for the vast majority of healers and tanks that my random queue as a DPS increased from 3 minutes to 30 minutes for no reason whatsoever.<br />

At least raiding is fun now, because it's not always DPS or tank's fault now...now even healers can make you wipe! :) If they can't heal properly as a team. Overhealing is a nice meter to check nowdays.<br />
And about the heroic dungeon gear requirement. Would been nice if there were diffrent requirements for all heroics, or at least 2 heroics that have to be done, before you can enter other heroics. Just to take out a few of the 3k dps players from the absolut hardest ones.<br />
And some LFD-groups are hard for the most casual players. Specially if you get to many melee, then there is always one melee dyieng on trash (or tank, depends on healer also ofc). People not following right target. And some groups get 1 good cc, some not even 1 good cc.<br />
I understand some frustration. I rather keep the difficulty as it is now, and keep the ilvl requirement. Can't make the game to bloody easy, even in heroic dungeons.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mandible</div><div class="date">2011-01-24, 01:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Regarding reputation from quests - yes it should be relative to your level. That way lower levels gave lower rep for higher level players and &quot;normal&quot; reputation for lower level players. Its insane to have reputation requirements on use of items if you can´t get enough rep until your level 85 - and what on earth can you use a banner that adds more experience to your kills for then...<br />
<br />
On the matter of ilvl its not just heroics and I just encountered one of the horror stories the other day. Normal Stonecore tank was in 3/4 dps gear and wanted to tank with that and saw nothing wrong in it due to obviously having the needed ilvl to enter the instance. So while you can kick these individuals its not something you should put on the players to manage if the game allows you to cheat your way around it or at the very least looks at it with very open eyes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Know Thy Enemy<br />
<br />
-&gt; Get an honorable, killing blow on five different races.<br />
<br />
<br />
That Takes Class<br />
<br />
-&gt; Get an honorable, killing blow on one of each class.<br />
<br />
But also a lot of other objectives in various batlegrounds...etc<br />
This would increase the interest of people in batlegrounds (yet there is NO point to farming BGs if you have already your &quot;blue&quot; Set) but also gives PvPers a way to earn gold without &quot;PvE&quot; dailies. <br />
It would also increase the number of people who would grind their BG dailies with other Guild Members.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I read also on the US forums that someone was complaining about new Guild and delay this guild would have compared to older guilds.<br />
This would be one solution, I wil try to explain it with one example :<br />
<br />
Guild A (Created at day 1 of Cataclysm)<br />
Guild B (Created 30 days later)<br />
So the first lvl 25 guild will hit the max lvl on 4/21/2011 about 135 days total (thx WoWWiki).<br />
<br />
Daily experience cap = 6,246K<br />
Experience to lvl 25 = 845,670K<br />
<br />
845670000 / ((135,39385206532180595581171950048 - 30) * 6246000)<br />
=1,2846465843321332543407920521351<br />
<br />
Guild A wil have a 6,246K experience cap per day (standard).<br />
Guild B will have a 6,246K * 1,2846465843321332543407920521351 experience cap per day.<br />
<br />
One thing I came across, was that the more people are involved (5,10 &amp; 25), the more you guild earns experience.<br />
Ok I know it sounds silly but look :<br />
<br />
If you are playing in arenas in 2's or 3's you can't obtain 80% of the group in guild mates.<br />
It's wether 50% (2v2) or 66,6% (3v3). Even if it's 2 guildies &amp; 1 random guy in 3's you can't win any guild experience...<br />
For Blizzard 80% means &quot;almost in full guild&quot; raid/rated batlegrounds, but arenas don't have this &quot;almost in full guild&quot; concept.<br />
To correct this you can scale experience with the % of guildies in the activity.<br />
<br />
A gew features that would be great to add :<br />
<br />
-Join random Batlegrounds with a &quot;raid&quot; group so that guild could farm Honor Points together.<br />
-Add more PvP related achievements.<br />
<br />
Eventually add an NPC that would trade justice/honor/valor/conquest points for Guild rep..:cool:<br />
<br />

Ps : Sorry for my bad English !<br />
Ps2: I'm Eu so i can't post it on the US forum...:(<br />

&gt; Healing was so good, and so efficient, toward the end of Wrath of the Lich King that healing wasn't a challenge for a geared player. Healers were able to make up for any number of mistakes made by their group, and almost never ran out of mana.<br />
&gt; That isn't a direction that we are comfortable continuing in since it obviated choices in the healing process, allowed players to effectively ignore encounter mechanics and, dare I say it, minimized skill as a component in healing.<br />
&gt; While there may be opposing perceptions of the results, I don't think it's laziness by anyone's standards to put thought, care and work into tuning a game to create a challenging but 'winnable' experience. I believe it would have been laziness to maintain the status quo. (Source)<br />
<br />
Long Text short: Healing was so good, and so efficient... so we broke it completly. Enjoy!</div></div><hr />
