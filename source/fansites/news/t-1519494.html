Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
We have been, and are continuing to make, significant widespread changes to damage and healing amounts. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464701906430865409))<br />
.On a related note, everyone, when you see datamining of the next build, DON'T FREAK OUT. We're doing things to adjust... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464703086703828992))<br />
....damage across the board for the 6.0 numbers, and that includes reducing a *ton* of numbers. Fear not, we'll balance it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464703267599970305))<br />
Will such datamining be &quot;soon&quot; or today? <br />
I have no idea when the next dataminable build will go up; could be any day. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464709955040198656))<br />
<br />
Are classes being reviewed holistically or round-robin? Are their any still on the to-do list? What are you working on atm?<br />
It's actually rather free-form. Some things are a &quot;Go down the list and make sure this is good for every spec.&quot; Some are... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464548287446798337))<br />
...more like &quot;We're getting a lot of feedback about this spell/passive/rotation/whatever. Lets discuss potential changes.&quot; (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464548464714862593))<br />
Things I'm actively working on atm include mostly the spell visual filtering, along with design and implementation of... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464548630230499328))<br />
...a couple potential changes to Ursa Major, Blood AM, and Moonkin rotation. We work very collaboratively as a team, too. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464549374622978048))<br />
NOTE: Emphasis on *potential*. We try out ideas for potential changes all the time, and don't always go with them. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464550165874233345))<br />
<br />
And will we get your fancy new spell effect filtering in 6.0, or we have to wait for WoD? :3 Swapping 10 -&gt; 25 really hurts atm!<br />
6.0. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464718455648694272))<br />
<br />
i have aa high end, i dont need any visual reduction.<br />
A) You do, for gameplay clarity reasons, not FPS performance reasons. B) Yes, it'll be an option. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464722068441800705))<br />
<br />
totally agree.&quot;hybrid&quot; used to mean something.now raid cds are taken away from hybrids and given to pure dps?<br />
The way you're wording it makes it sound like we're removing all of it. That's not the case. If you imagine each spec's... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465115154233823232))<br />
...stackable raid utility as a digit, we're changing the world from &quot;1122334444555555566&quot; to &quot;2222222222222222222&quot;. Make sense? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465115402788302849))<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/269-Death-Knight) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/death-knight) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#Y))<br />
Is Necrotic Strike really absorbing 100% of attack power in WOD instead of 225% on live ? Or is the tooltip still bugged in WOD<br />
What &quot;100% of Attack Power&quot; means has changed. Formulae aren't comparably like that between 5.4 and 6.0. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464700143095144448))<br />
Yep, I know, 100% in WOD is like 50% on live. So 100% NS comared to 225% on live is like a 4/5 nerf !<br />
It's simply not that simple. Rest assured, it won't be a useless button, as you fear. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464702035112116224))<br />
<br />
still feel like the level 75 (soon 60) dk talents are the worst in game. No other class requires talents for resource generation<br />
Why does it matter to you whether a core part of your gameplay comes from talents or from baseline skills? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464709556539363328))<br />
it's not as much that as it is that the dk talents aren't compelling in any way. No choices that add depth to our gameplay.<br />
Not sure what you're talking about. Which rune regen talent you take has a big impact on your gameplay, and adds depth. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464719209381912576))<br />
yes, they have a big impact on how we play. In that they're required in order for us to not have obscene amounts of downtime.<br />
Curious; I hear talking like this thrown around often, but I'm dubious of how many people even try playing without for comparison. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464720600515104768))<br />
you ever tried leveling a dk now from scratch? The difference is immediate, noticeable, and immense.<br />
Yes, and that has a ton to do with gear and abilities available as well. Fact is, that row accounts for about 10-15% of your GCDs. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464721558942912513))<br />
And that's big, certainly, especially feeling-wise, which is why we moved it down to lvl 60 for 6.0. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464721850077937665))<br />
I don't think you truly understand DK's. If you don't choose BT you're doing it wrong.<br />
I think you may be confusing &quot;Unholy DKs in PvP&quot; for &quot;All DKs&quot;. BT is not used by the majority of DKs, and they're not wrong. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464805151572639744))<br />
<br />
Will the new Pestilence be usable without a target, like current Blood Boil? A very useful counter against stealth in PvP!<br />
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465617474751180800))<br />
<br />
am I going to have to actually use army or us it going back to being a cosmetic thing?<br />
It'll be instant, and worth using, at least on the pull. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465629937123090432))<br />

Since balance druids tranquility is now so 'small' it does 0 healing what are we supposed to have?<br />
Stampeding Roar, other utility abilities, and a ton of talented utility (especially offhealing). (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464725607712964608))<br />

Hunter 100 talents: Will Focusing Shot trigger Master Marksman for MM? Will master call/spirit bond still work with Lone Wolf?<br />
Focusing Shot will trigger Master Marksman. Master's Call and Spirit Bond will not work without a pet. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464698228760272896))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/272-Mage) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/mage) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#g))<br />
Raidwide healing recieved is way too big raid utility (when other dps healing utility gone). Raids will stack mages<br />
Why would they stack Mages? Where's the logic? Your &quot;way too big&quot; seems to be based on hyperbole, not fact. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464833699595313152))<br />
Thats my point - stacking Mages will save heal. therefore I take 5-6 Mages as dps and can afford less healer<br />
A 12% increase to healing received is minor. Same as Smoke Bomb. Or Rallying Cry. Or all the others competing. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464806186089316352))<br />
<br />
But mages already have bloodlust, iceblock, frost ring, etc. Why do they need another?<br />
Bloodlust is not stackable raid utility. It's like being able to give a crit buff. Ice Block and Ring of Frost are... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464832577434431488))<br />
...extremely small, in the grand scheme of things, as far as raid utility goes, in most situations. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464832900978847744))<br />
With that logic why not give every class a bloodlust? Don't get why mages get love over rogues (who need it)<br />
Because you have raid buffs and debuffs in order to make you stronger in a group, and diversify compositions. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464833942084788224))<br />
<br />
The problem is that you give a DPS a stackable raidwide &quot;Heal-Support&quot; skill like Amplify Magic for Mages...<br />
Yes, we give them a small one, because they had none, and lower everyone else down to equally small. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464718088965873665))<br />
<br />
The mirror images will get their spell power increase but will they get health/resist as well? For more survivability.<br />
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465617534398365697))<br />
<br />
Any chance we see a variation of Cone of Cold for arcane? Maybe &quot;Arcane Pulse&quot; - Push back and increased dmg?<br />
Arcane's AoE is naturally a short range instant; too much overlap. Supernova is somewhat similar to what you describe. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465618301704364032))<br />
<br />

Is there any chance for Glyph of Touch of Death and Glyph of Touch of Karma to become baseline in WoD? They kinda feel mandatory<br />
Glyph of Touch of Death is a kiss/curse; definitely not mandatory, at all. Glyph of Touch of Karma is strong, especially in Arenas. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464708053946740736))<br />
Also i don't see how to use Karma while being slowed, rooted or feared to china. That Glyph is a must have, no room for decision<br />
In many cases, those are bad times to use ToK anyway. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464710276537778176))<br />
How should i get off a ToK against a ranged then? I'd like to set it on my target not some rnd pet standing next to me.<br />
Presumably, the same way you punch that ranged. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464718271069945858))<br />
<br />
any chance that chi torpedo be changed for ww to be something competitive with rjw and xuen?<br />
Chi Torpedo is lacking for everyone, since RJW was changed to its current version. We're considering potential changes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464725840077393920))<br />
<br />
Why does BrM taunt have 10y longer range and have the movement on application?<br />
Why not? (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/464903346566881281))<br />
Taunt is simple ability. Why would 1 out of 5 taunts be better in every way?<br />
Brewmasters have the best taunt (though I could see someone saying DKs do). Doesn't mean they're the best tank. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/464910274311372801))<br />
<br />
Problem with that is it takes 2 globals for monks to do as much ST healing as other healers do in 1.<br />
Not actually. Soothing only has a 0.5sec GCD. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465275510969217024))<br />
well this is new, it will still take longer to switch targets after a surging though<br />
If you're only doing 1 Surging, perhaps. It also is more front loaded. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465276707885174786))<br />
Won't just 1 surging be fairly common though in world where spot healing is necessary and encouraged?<br />
Soothing would be better in this case. Surging on top if you really have to. And of course Renewing. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465617439649050625))<br />

Any changes being discussed about AoW for Rets? Worried that if exo is low priority again that it'll be an unused proc again.<br />
Kinda confused about why people focus on AoW; it's just Exo that's weak, nothing specific to AoW. Just a tuning issue. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464827354297024512))<br />
If it's just a tuning issue why wasn't there a hotfix on it?<br />
Because we didn't want to change Ret's rotation through a hotfix. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464879498169577472))<br />
Not rebalancing classes through hotfixes &quot;mid xpack&quot; feels lazy from your part. Hello Disc... zzzZzzZz<br />
Mid-expansion is different from mid-patch. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464903214639230976))<br />
You changed Kil'jaeden's cunning. Sure it's a talent but it affected their rotation. I know exo...<br />
Yes, in a patch, not a hotfix. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464909891065221121))<br />

spriest Halo fix? Specific addon + guess work isn't nice. Against blizz spell design as well? Make it more forgiving pls?<br />
It's actually extremely forgiving. We've never found the addon to be mandatory or even a noticeable gain. You get ~max effect... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464827730555441152))<br />
...in a really large coverage area. Offhand, I think it's something like you get within 5% of max between 20 and 28 yd. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464828154305994752))<br />
<br />
Or do you really think that removing the DR cap on the L90 talents was a good move?<br />
We've talked about this previously. I've said that uncapping Priest L90 talents was a huge mistake. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464907339053543424))<br />
Leaving it KNOWING it is completly OP for Disc for half year (+?) is a mistake you are aware of but ignore!<br />

How will subtlety rogues be able to use non-dagger weapons if backstab is here to stay and meant to be superior to hemo?<br />
They won't. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465116995579412480))<br />
<br />
I agree to some extent, I believe if ShadowStep was on a 15-16 second cd it would on par with BoS and more competitive<br />
it's ironic as BoS was buffed to keep up with Shadowstep...which used to be a 24 second cooldown (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/465185361874800640))<br />
<br />
The current numbers imply BS will be much more superior to Hemo in WoD compared to now.<br />
I believe that in the current build you have, the tuning for Backstabbing and Ambush may be swapped (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465239941086068737))<br />

Has Elemental Blast becoming baseline for Elemental been discussed? And what are your thoughts for and against it?<br />
It's been discussed. We want to leave the baseline rotation simpler, and allow you to choose to talent into more complexity. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464706458790019073))<br />

Can you explain how the &quot;Improved Healing Rain&quot; Draenor perk works? Does it buff heals from casting Shaman or all healing taken<br />
Just the casting Shaman. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464832380088233984))<br />
Will base healing numbers be balanced assuming target is in an HR and lower than other healers outside one or is it a true buff?<br />
It's all relative. You'll be balanced around *some* usage of all of your tools. Otherwise, you wouldn't have them. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464833456506036224))<br />

I haven't been counting number of tweets I make per class; would rather not tweet than bother with that. Warlocks got a ton of... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464718815725506560))<br />

I'm just getting the impression it's: &quot;If it isn't used in a raid, cut it.&quot; The outside world matters to us too.<br />
That's definitely not the guiding philosophy. In any case, Soulshatter is something we're taking a close look at. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/465354898054590464))<br />

No, you'll still be able to solo old raids just as well as before, if not easier. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464705903392866304))<br />

How about change quest item getting while in raid group? How raid on different continent can help me get 10 quest items faster?<br />
We're looking into a solution for this - it's a real nuisance if you want to quest while waiting for a raid to fill or RBG queue (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/465182753911472128))<br />

Curious what the biggest bottleneck in expansion production tends to be? Art, class design, tech or programming?<br />
We tend to shape our workload around what resources we have, and vice versa. Production aims to have the answer be 'All equally'. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/464720418067075072))<br />

Excuse me I hate to interrupt but your pants appear to be one fire. Of course there alpha's and beta's are scheduled around the industry, blizzard run scared every time a competitor comes around. It never really amount to anything but all it would take at this point is a single competitor who can produce good end game content and WoW is in for some real trouble.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sure theres a certain amount of marketting involved, and its pretty easy to make a post on the website on whatever date something else is launching to try and steal a bit of attention, but its a huge leap to then make the assumption that they schedule project milestones around those things, thats just ridiculous. <br />
<br />
These milestones would have been planned out far, far in advance, possibly even years ago.  Sure, they've slipped, but honestly who here who is a software engineer or designer and has worked on any project of significant size and hasn't had slippage or scope creep to deal with? Sometimes it just happens no matter how well you planned, because of reasons you just didn't consider at the time or because of necessary changes that had to be made to the scope of the project as it progressed and you needed to adapt. &quot;No plan survives first contact with the enemy&quot; as the saying goes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go look at Dalaran in game, around 40% of it is different, some things don't exist at all, some things swapped places, some things were extended.<br />
<br />
Also, Blizzard care 100% about whats happening in the Industry, but I think they don't aim in advance for releases/announcements to counter others, but if they can push out/holdback something by a minimal amount, i.e, a few weeks, to counter someone else, they will do it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Luckily they never said they don't care then hey. Just that it doesn't impact their project milestones. Of course they care, from a business perspective but I'm sure also just because they're gamers and they're interested in new developments in the industry or keen to play the next big thing. At the end of the day, you don't make games unless you have a passion for games because its a HARD job. And you can't make good games unless you're also playing good games and keeping your finger on the pulse so to speak. Doesn't mean you go and structure your project around what other people are doing though, thats not just bad project management, thats bad business.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But they're not saying they don't care.<br />
<br />
They're saying they don't arrange their entire internal processes and effort milestones around it. Whenever someone tries to do something like that in project management, make it the primary influence, it screwed up the entire project.<br />
<br />
People are jsut sseeing what they want.

There's no Silver Covenant or Sunreaver district, and there's no sewer on top of that.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the landing pad is actually in the middle of the city instead of off to the side (the current Dalaran landing site is where the Dragon Embassy is listed on the layout chart).<br />

Logic. Use it.<br />

When Blizzard releases something new, be it patch notes, PTR, a beta, etc to coincide with another MMO release (hint: the alpha notes for Warlords were released when they were not because the Alpha was ready, but because ESO launched on the same day) and then say that they don't do that, then I'm going to call them on their bullshit.<br />

Yeah, no. That would mean WoD would release about or over 2 years and 3 months since WoD. That beats Vanilla-BC (2 years 2 months) and WotLK-Cata (2 years 1 month). Not only that, but a December+ release would imply a testing cycle of 7+ months. This, once again, dwarfs the testing cycles of other expansions which have typically lasted no longer than 6 months (counting alpha and beta). <br />
<br />
There is no reason to think that WoD would take such a significantly longer time to release. ESPECIALLY considering Blizzard's confidence in an absolute deadline of December 21.</div></div><hr />

If they were trying to counter ESO's release, they did a very poor job. No one is going to stay subscribed to WoW over some hints at an alpha release if they were already going to hop over to ESO. <br />
<br />
You would also think that if this were a trend, they would be doing it every time, but this isn't true. You have conspicuous releases like patch 4.3 just a couple weeks before SWTOR, but at the same time you have times like RIFT's release where nothing happened in WoW at all. Aion's worldwide release happened in September 2009, which didn't seem to warrant a patch from Blizzard (well, Onyxia was revamped, I bet players excited for Aion totally had a dilemma over that one!). It also took 2 months after Warhammer's release for Blizzard to release WotLK, which isn't exactly a good response time. Hell, for reasons already mentioned, they barely &quot;responded&quot; to ESO's release too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good point. I remember them doing exactly this before Cataclysm; clarification after clarification on the system changes. Unfortunately, given how poor the WoW community seems to be at reading comprehension (i.e. people asking the same questions/making the same mistakes time and time again), it seems like it's something they NEED to do. <br />
<br />
<br />
Alpha getting delayed makes me worried that they are going to end up delaying the expansion till 2015. At this point, I am starting to get worried we will be lucky if it comes out in Dec.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard is to be trusted, the reason alpha is being delayed is because the introduction quest chain to Draenor is not finished yet and they want that to be completed in time for testing. This is, of course, a pathetically stupid decision that is holding up testing for the entire expansion. <br />
<br />
Of course, they could also be lying and they might be severely behind schedule, but they did after all have at least two zones ready for BETA, let alone alpha, at the press tours a few months ago.</div></div><hr />

I said it in the post above yours and I'll say it again: if this is an attempt to counter ESO's release it is a very poor one. Who is honestly going to suddenly ditch ESO on release day because there were some hints that a friends-and-family alpha was soon to start for WoD, and who is honestly going to argue that Blizzard doesn't realize this themselves?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Information dumps have nothing to do with production schedules or milestones. Information is information - how far along they are in production is not at all linked to what other games are doing. They're not suddenly going to *release* WoD on the day that Wildstar is released - if they did, then you could (maybe) call bullshit on what he said.<br />
<br />
Atm I'm not aware of any other MMO due to be released &quot;at latest&quot; December 21st. So that doesnt coincide with anything (besides christmas sales - and then only if it comes out the latest possible date)</div></div><hr />

<br />
WoW stuff has been delayed several times before so this isn't a big issue. But i guess if they listen to everyone's PMSing and released it sooner, you'd guys would still say that it's to compete with Wildstar anyways. Then you would all realize your dissatisfaction with the unfinished WoD content and continue to bitch about how &quot;lazy&quot; blizzard is because they didn't finish it despite the fact that they did it because you people cried for it to come sooner. You folks are the cause of your own problems, not Blizzard. Geezus, the cookies will be done when they're finished baking yo.<br />

Anyways, those fan made models look great! I hope Blizzard ends up making them as facial options (with the exception of the blood elf and udnead versions). i really like the one with the HD eyes and the one with the purple face paint seen on Classic's box art.</div></div><hr />

In pvp its blood tap or gtfo. Sounds like &quot;depth&quot; to me right bliz?<br />

I guess I just imagined them trying to counter every upcoming MMO either with info dumps or patches. Blizzard most certainly do care about what's happening in the industry.<br />
<br />
i'm positive the dev's don't care to much about that, however there are other people who decide when the patches/xpacks should be released.<br />
they DO match up to some degree, ofc they do. as far as info dumps - meh, that wouldn't stop me from buying a game.</div></div><hr />

Logic. Use it.<br />
<br />
Except that they DO hold on their patches/betas/big info when they CAN (wich means, when they have it ready, but hold it when they know something will happen near and will be far better to hold it and bomb the competitors launches) to bomb other launches. Just check how many times they did it alread.<br />
<br />
Really doubt we won't get something on wildstar launch. Bet it 5.4.something (actually the item upgrade buff is just to get some ppl back to the game instead of floating around putting their time and effort on other MMOs), Heroes of the Storm beta, WoD alpha, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why do ppl think that there is no content in WoD? Just because it uses the same setting of a place that exists (in another form)???<br />
<br />
It's the same crap as TBC, WotLK or MoP. Just a new continent to level while doing quests and their raids. Cataclysm would go far better into that thing of &quot;least content delivered&quot; since it was mostly a big re-use of old continents.<br />
<br />
Wich basically is not true, but would be the logic statement based on the fact that WoD happens in &quot;outland again&quot;...<br />
<br />
&quot;oh, no new race, no content&quot;... because putting a new model in the game is so much new content, right? Did we get new race or class in Cata? No... &quot;But we did get new class/race combos!&quot; Right! Tons of new content!!! lol.<br />
<br />
Why ppl would care so much about a new Halion? To just complain that Blizzard just did a &quot;onebossminimapcrapbecausetheydontcare&quot;? &quot;Plz nerf new halion&quot;, etc.? Omg...</div></div><hr />

As above this post we got two new playable races in Cata, those being Worgen and Goblin.. WoTLK it was a new Class, TBC was two new races and each faction got a class from each other.. And of course MoP got a new race and class..</div></div><hr />

I remember them doing exactly this before Cataclysm; clarification after clarification on the system changes. Unfortunately, given how poor the WoW community seems to be at reading comprehension (i.e. people asking the same questions/making the same mistakes time and time again), it seems like it's something they NEED to do. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If Blizzard is to be trusted, the reason alpha is being delayed is because the introduction quest chain to Draenor is not finished yet and they want that to be completed in time for testing. This is, of course, a pathetically stupid decision that is holding up testing for the entire expansion. <br />
<br />
Of course, they could also be lying and they might be severely behind schedule, but they did after all have at least two zones ready for BETA, let alone alpha, at the press tours a few months ago.<br />

No silly, wait until the release of Wildstar then theyll give more info... ^_^</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">F-Minus</div><div class="date">2014-05-17, 10:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, no. That would mean WoD would release about or over 2 years and 3 months since WoD. That beats Vanilla-BC (2 years 2 months) and WotLK-Cata (2 years 1 month). Not only that, but a December+ release would imply a testing cycle of 7+ months. This, once again, dwarfs the testing cycles of other expansions which have typically lasted no longer than 6 months (counting alpha and beta). <br />
<br />
There is no reason to think that WoD would take such a significantly longer time to release. ESPECIALLY considering Blizzard's confidence in an absolute deadline of December 21.<br />
<br />
It's probably not going to be in 2015, but a late 2014 release. I don't know why people still don't see the big picture, when it's the same with every damn expansion of WoW. They support the expansion for around a year and the other year is fully unsupported - which means you get to be stuck with an boring game with no new major content for around 8-12 month. And it's the same deal every single expansion. <br />
<br />
And every single expansion they go an say: &quot;We will try to speed up the process of delivering content and new expansions.&quot; Which by now, everyone should realize it's just a bad lie. <br />
<br />
I've learned this, and after I'm done with the last big raid, just unsubscribe. I don't have anything to do in the game, why should I keep paying them monthly. Obviously there is enough people who stay subbed or they would at least try to support the expansion some more with patches and raids. How can you or anyone be happy with SoO for 8+ months I don't know, and still support Blizzard. <br />
<br />
There's nothing wrong with them taking time, but it would be nice if they would give players something for their money in the meanwhile. The valor changes and shit, barely count for a spit in the bucket what is needed, like a completely new raid etc.</div></div><hr />

The valor changes and shit, barely count for a spit in the bucket what is needed, like a completely new raid etc.A very rational post. The problem is for Blizz how can you win? If they say soon it is safe for them but everyone complains. If they say its ahead of schedule everyone complains even though they never knew THE SCHEDULE. I know they promised to try to get content faster, but they should have just said &quot;soon&quot;. You see what I'm saying? If they put out another raid that delays WOD so everyone says &quot;Lame raid we want WOD&quot;, but if they say no raid, everyone gets impatient and says &quot;We wanted a raid&quot;.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile they decided the schedule for the whole company like at least a year ago. You can't just get 4000 employees to switch projects every day, people work on their respective teams and coordinators do the best they can to schedule everything so there are no delays, and yet, 1 bad line of code can delay the project for weeks. That is the real world, and this is not coke vs. pepsi. This is just Blizzard doing what they have done for years, which is delay projects until they are ready.<br />
<br />
The fact remains that they never promised you a date on anything. Just take a few months off, as F-minus is doing.</div></div><hr />

Did, and that guy is never really happy.<br />
<br />
How about him finding something else to fill his life with when ONE game is in that stage between old content and new...? Nobody is forced to pay. Least so people like that videos maker who seem to be so unhappy with the game that every other video he makes is a bash of it. <br />
<br />
&quot;But I pay because I still raid&quot; which many people bring as an argument...WELL THEN HOORAY, you have a reason to play, so why do you whinge about not having anything to do and paying for nothing? Sheesh...people will scream for MORE and NEW these days but still never be happy.

The disappointing part is that they seemed to be actually serious about it with MoP's release. Cataclysm ended up being the shortest expansion period. They also released patches faster than ever throughout MoP. Now they have dropped the ball.</div></div><hr />

How about him finding something else to fill his life with when ONE game is in that stage between old content and new...? Nobody is forced to pay. Least so people like that videos maker who seem to be so unhappy with the game that every other video he makes is a bash of it. <br />
<br />
&quot;But I pay because I still raid&quot; which many people bring as an argument...WELL THEN HOORAY, you have a reason to play, so why do you whinge about not having anything to do and paying for nothing? Sheesh...people will scream for MORE and NEW these days but still never be happy. Be happy in the present I say, even if that means maybe doing something else for a while besides playing WoW.You're babbling. The best point he makes is that WOW has 12 months of content and then 12 months of nothing. It's really shocking but very consistent over all the expansions.</div></div><hr />

2 things:<br />

1) pretty sure there was some of this same phenomena with star wars<br />

2) blues like Zarhym are, no matter how nice they be as persons, nothing more than corporate shrills whose job description requires that they tow or push the company line until corporate changes their minds and pulls the rug out from under them and then they have to tow the new corporate line - often ending up completely contradicting what they were saying for the past 6 months - and the examples of that occurring are too numerous to mention - though the best case example may be the defence of not getting mounts until 40 and wanting people to experience the world and then the introduction of flying in Wrath</div></div><hr />

Surely it is the other companies that should be far more worried about what Blizzard do, and not the other way around?<br />
<br />
Oh and citing random JRPG #22 in any justification of release dates really doesn't count :)<br />
<br />
Blizzard released a screenshot of a fern on the same day Wildstar had an open beta weekend. Clearly that was intended as a distraction.<br />
<br />
Blizzard announced the Hunters will be losing Hunter´s mark the day before TESO launched.... which is a clear indication that Blizzard is worried about that wow-killer. Not only that, Cat druids will be losing Mangle... surely that information right there is enough to bury TESO and keep thousands, if not millions of players from trying TESO.<br />
<br />
People are just stupid. If Wildstar had launched this week, those same people would have pointed to 5 different things Blizzard did as a ´counter to Wildstar´..<br />
<br />
Who cares, Wildstar and TESO will both announce F2P before WoD launches. Of course then the idiots will say that WOW is releasing WoD to counter the f2p versions of those games..<br />

Yeah, sorry. I find it hilarious that they think that Wildstar isn't going to measure up. I'm quite pleased with the Wildstar beta, enough to switch. :P Garrisons will never hold a candle to WS's housing.<br />

Titan was cancelled because it was too similar to Destiny. Originally they were going to create it within Blizzard, but decided to just scoop up a new development house to do Destiny, which made Titan redundant.</div></div><hr />

Because you don´t understand what he is saying. Even if all the clutter causes no FPS problems on your computer, the fact that there are so many layers of graphics on top of each other makes it impossible to see what is dangerous on the ground. If you are melee dps, and stacked with 8 other melee dps, you absolutely cannot see the range of some aoe abilities.<br />
<br />
They are decluttering not only to help people with poor FPS, but also to help players see what is important for their characters to see. To see things on the ground that your character needs to react to.<br />

<br />
But that is the thing. Blizzard is ALWAYS releasing new information.<br />
<br />
Like I said, if Wildstar had been released this past week, these same idiots would be here screaming about how Blizzard released NE-female artwork as a counter to Wildstar. Or maybe Blizzard sold Blizzcon tickets so people wouldn´t have money to spend on Wildstar.<br />
<br />
The only time WOW goes ´quiet´ is when Blizzard is releasing a different game. WOW went quiet for about 3 weeks around the time that the Diablo Expansion launched. They didn´t want to steal their thunder. It is funny how people find connections. One person.. I kid you not.. even suggested that Blizzard released the Diablo expansion in order to counter a Wildstar free weekend.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Apparently being late on an xpac is the same as: &quot;f--- them right up the a-- ... f---ing dry with a 12 and a half inch spiky dildo.&quot; :P<br />
<br />
I'm sorry but I can't take this whining seriously.<br />
<br />
Then you obviously missed the point of the video. It is far less to do about the expansion being &quot;late&quot; and everything to do with the giant void of content Blizzard seem to have absolutely no problem in serving up to it's already-shrinking player-base.<br />
<br />
The continually slipping of WoD's release would be far, FAR easier to swallow if there was something to actually DO between now and then. We get told 5.5 is cancelled and no further content patches can occur because its all hand's on deck for WoD. We even get told by GC pre-departure (which is starting to make more and more sense now...) that the beta is closer than we think. Fast forward to frigging May 2014 and we STILL have absolutely nothing since Blizzcon last year to show for it. No content, no release date, no sign of even the bloody beta which alone should take 4-6 months at best. <br />
<br />
I've already cancelled my WoW sub purely due to Blizzard's complete apathy on the subject and honestly hope others do the same. Not because I want to see WoW fail but for the exact opposite reason; I want Blizzard to actually give a damn about its game and its player-base again but the bottom line seems to be pretty much all they listen to these days. Will WoD win me back? Believe it or not, I honestly hope it does. But like the video says, it is going to have to be goddamn magical if it has any hope of even preserving current subscription numbers let alone actually win any back. I am following news on WoD's development very closely and while I can see a fair few gems in it I like, it really lacks the overall &quot;Wow&quot; factor (no pun intended) WotLK, Cata and even to an extent, MoP had. With that in mind, heaven help Blizzard if they expect to win back far less &quot;in the know&quot; former-subscribers. I mean think about it; if you were a far more casual former WoW player and had a cursory look over what WoD has to offer, what would you see? BC part II, not-player housing and...what? The inability to fly, for better or worse?<br />
<br />
Obviously there is far more to WoD than that alone but Blizzard seem far more interested in marketing stupid fake reality crap about poorly designed motorcycles than they are marking/actually releasing this expansion. To top it off, they seem ESPECIALLY more interested in that than doing pretty much anything whatsoever to appease the growing discontent among those still paying to play.<br />
<br />

Exactly, Do people think that they have to sacrifice a newborn to unsubscribe? Just unsubcribe. it is very easy. I have done it probably 10 times already. Bored with the current content? unsubscribe Hate a major change they did? unsubscribe.<br />

I think to some WoW is like a drug and well probably is, I remember the hoohah over Everquest when people died playing that game, was why in the end it got its alternate name of Evercrack because it was so addictive.. And so I see the similar sort of thing here people find it hard to let go so complain about what they see as lack of things happening whether it is true or not..<br />

It would be like if I spent a few hours every day reading about justin beiber, and then post in forums making fun of bieber fans, wouldn't you ask me why I didn't just go stay in the tool forums with people that I can actually have a stimulating conversation with instead of just a pointless back and forth troll. The fact is that Justin Bieber gets no attention from me. This is the most times I have ever said his name in a conversation and honestly, I hate that I even acknowledged his existence just now.<br />

<br />
The so called bitching in this thread and the posted video is about a lack on content. That's hardly &quot;making shit up to bitch&quot; its a valid cause of complaint.The video about a lack of content does not acknowledge that there is ANY content coming at all but really (and he admits this) what he means is the content is the same old thing. He's tired of playing wow, but his little channel can't shut down cause he profits from it, because he has a loyal band of viewers who believe anything he says no matter how unbalanced and over the top he goes, because they are disenfranchised. Wow has had millions (like 100 million) people who quit playing it over the years. Of course anyone talking shit about wow has an audience because if you take a sample of 100 million people, you will have about 1 million crazy people, 10 million depressed people, and 20 million people who will believe whatever you tell them because they're scared little followers. That is like shooting fish in a barrel, and that's not even counting the people who are still addicted, but cannot for whatever reason pay the sub. <br />
<br />
And again he's just MAD BECAUSE ALPHA IS LATE! Except of course they never promised a date so technically ITS NOT EVEN LATE.<br />
<br />
For years now people are making money off of talking shit about wow, and of course you guys only think Blizzard makes money off of wow. Talk about naive.</div></div><hr />

Everyone's free to do whatever they want, but I must ask... then why don't you (not exactly you, the general you) just freaking quit, even if temporarily? Is WoW really so important that Blizzard must have new content ready all the time until the new expansion drops, to the point of it being considered &quot;insulting&quot;? Aren't there other games someone can play while WoW is in a bad state? Aren't there other activities to be done other than playing WoW?<br />
<br />
Don't interpret what I'm saying here wrong. I'm not defending Blizzard or the lack of content until Warlords, I have no excuses for them. However, it puzzles me how people talk about this as if WoW is the only thing to do for months, as if without Blizzard adding new content, there's nothing else to do.<br />
<br />
What the hell drives people to feel so insulted by a lack of content in a game when there's other games to play out there? I don't disagree that the huge content gap sucks, but it's no reason to throw tantrums and go mental over it.</div></div><hr />

To try and stop the hemorrhaging of players during the Cata final content patch Lag, they tried the annual pass.<br />
<br />

You must be replying to the wrong person, because your post barely relates to what you quoted. I don't really care about when WoW peaked, how they stopped subscription loss, or what is driving players away. I never made any mention of any of that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) pretty sure there was some of this same phenomena with star wars<br />
<br />
2) blues like Zarhym are, no matter how nice they be as persons, nothing more than corporate shrills whose job description requires that they tow or push the company line until corporate changes their minds and pulls the rug out from under them and then they have to tow the new corporate line - often ending up completely contradicting what they were saying for the past 6 months - and the examples of that occurring are too numerous to mention - though the best case example may be the defence of not getting mounts until 40 and wanting people to experience the world and then the introduction of flying in Wrath<br />
<br />
If you can cite the Star Wars thing, then that's great. Point 2) means absolutely nothing here, I hope you realize.</div></div><hr />

Why does it matter to you whether a core part of your gameplay comes from talents or from baseline skills?No comment necessary.<br />
<br />
Curious; I hear talking like this thrown around often, but I'm dubious of how many people even try playing without for comparison (Instead of just taking recommended BT and macroing it in often-used buttons).<br />
<br />
I think you may be confusing &quot;Unholy DKs in PvP&quot; for &quot;All DKs&quot;. BT is not used by the majority of DKs, and they're not wrong. He's quite clearly playing a different game, maybe Titan or something.<br />
<br />
Bloodlust is not stackable raid utility. It's like being able to give a crit buff. Ice Block and Ring of Frost are extremely small, in the grand scheme of things, as far as raid utility goes, in most situations. (Celestalon) That is, they are not worried by mages being able to cast the most powerful buff in the game (currently it's on top of stuff like Arcane Brilliance, 2/8 in 1). So impartial it makes my teeth ache a bit.<br />
<br />
Glyph of Touch of Death is a kiss/curse; definitely not mandatory, at all. With 3Chi cost I consider glyph pretty much mandatory to keep the skill on my main bar.<br />
<br />
Warlocks got a ton of change in Mists, and so are getting less that others in Warlords. So, less to talk about. Happy to answer questions; not ignoring. Warlocks were made dreadfully OP in MoP so it's OK to keep them like that when most other classes get a fairly strong nerfbat to the face. Seems legit. Also, I kinda new that destro alt will finally come in really really useful.<br />
<br />
We tend to shape our workload around what resources we have, and vice versa. Production aims to have the answer be 'All equally'. Again, no comment necessary.<br />
<br />

I am mightily amused at people who waste their time engaging blizdevs on Twitter with actual concerns.</div></div><hr />

I am mightily amused at people who waste their time engaging blizdevs on Twitter with actual concerns.I love that I get to choose my rune regen method and after spending several years trying different talents from that row with all 3 specs I can assure you that BT is not always the best one to take. Get a grip and go try it on a target dummy.<br />
<br />
When the warlock was being fixed before MOP everyone said &quot;warlocks are getting the nerfbat to the face.&quot; Perhaps you should think about what getting a nerfbat to the face means. And still my mage has a lower ilvl than my lock and does way more dps on most fights (both have legendary cloaks, etc, so they should be pretty close on dps) so all I hear is warlock QQ.<br />
<br />
I am mightily amused by people who get butthurt so easily.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The game's been on it's way out for a while, no shots across the bow or cock blocking other titles are going to help it.</div></div><hr />

So much truth it hurts, what's even sad is people are actually against what he's saying. It's like people can't take off their rose tinted glasses when it comes down to saying Blizzard fubards their fanbase when it's right in their faces.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doomchicken</div><div class="date">2014-05-20, 02:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LoL I know right? Ive been playing this game long enough to slowly realize theyve been doing this. We know what stunt theyre trying to pull. What I find funny is, some people are acting oblivious like it is not happening and its just pure coincidence. Ha ha! Thats what im chuckling my arse over here lol. Ive mentioned it in other posts in the past. Im not saying theyll make a big dent into their sub numbers, but damn, for them to coincide things that shouldve been out by now and make excuses like its not ready yet were smoothing things out, then BAM new MMO release, more alpha news and the beta testing date! More screenshots! /facepalm Its just getting pathetic.<br />
<br />
The fact that you honestly believe that alpha notes and a BETA release would impact the decision making process of people in what games they should play is more facepalm than than anything blizz are doing right now. News flash: info and the beta for wildstar have been out for AGES. People who are wanting to play wildstar are not going to suddenly not care about wildstar because of a BETA that will be constantly pulled down for new builds, balancing issues, server stability testing and so forth.<br />
If WoD came out a week or two before Wildstar or after wildstar, then and only then would you have an actual argument.<br />

5 million people have quit.<br />
The lags between the final content patch and expansions is driving players away.<br />
WoW peaked in Wotlk and the time between ICC and Cata was a year, they lost millions of people during that time.<br />
To try and stop the hemorrhaging of players during the Cata final content patch Lag, they tried the annual pass.<br />
<br />
Try again. They've always had the long lag time. So why didn't it kill people off between Vanilla and BC? Why did it not Kill the game between BC and Wrath? Why did it make no difference between Wrath and Cata? Because the length wasn't the issue. The largest player base (the casuals) still had shit to do and still wanted to play the game, while the majority of the non hardcore raiders still had the raid itself to clear. The only people this long period effects is the very miniscule player base that has actually cleared Siege on heroic content and has &quot;nothing to do&quot;. <br />
<br />
The real reason the Cata-Mop had big losses is because the final Tier was almost universally hated, by casuals and hardcores alike.<br />
If it had been a good tier and a long tier, similar to ICC It would of never had the drop it had. Yes. Some would of quit, as people always are quitting over one reason or the other, but a hated tier plus a long tier is a big sub loss tier. That is one of the lessons Cata showed people who can pay attention.</div></div><hr />

Originally they were going to create it within Blizzard, but decided to just scoop up a new development house to do Destiny, which made Titan redundant.<br />
<br />
...citation needed. Especially since Titan wasn't cancelled; the project was restarted and the development team was downsized.<br />

<br />
The wrong is strong with this one. <br />
<br />
The time between ICC and Cata was December 8 2009 - December 7 2010; about a year, as you say. WoW's subscribers peaked at 12 million in October 2010; 11 months into ICC. In fact, the first subscriber loss occurred during Q1 2011 (January - March). That loss was 600k. <br />
So you were right on only half the claims in your post: WoW's subscribers peaked in WotLK and the time between ICC and Cata was 1 year. They did not lose subscribers in that time and they didn't even lose over a million until Q3 2011.</div></div><hr />
