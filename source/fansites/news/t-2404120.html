<br />
That's stupid. The &quot;value&quot; of pathfinder is questionable in the first place. People aren't doing Pathfinder because they value the achievements, they're doing it because they want flight to skip all the bullshit they're forced to slog through to get it. <br />
<br />
Like I said, Ion needs to pull the stick out of his ass about this. Either he's completely oblivious to believe the bullshit he's spewing, or he's spinning an excuse to keep people dealing with the garbage ground design even while leveling in areas that don't matter.<br />

<br />
Which is fine. As much as I dislike Pathfinder's halfassed implementation, I realize that it's not going away. But when we jump through all the hoops to get flight, there's NO EXCUSE to release later zones that take flight away again. It's bad enough already that we have to re-earn it every expansion, much less having to deal with losing it mid-expansion too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is ridiculous. Why must M+ and Raiding share the same reward pool? Mythic quality gear from the weekly chest is absurd. This basically confirms that I have to faceroll content other than Raiding in order to Raid better. I don't consider this to be OK, especially if you don't like M+.</div></div><hr />

Any zone with flying would still allow players to fly in, zerg objective and fly out. Unless you want a lot of indoor zones where in addition to not flying you're also not able to mount.</div></div><hr />

Maybe you just didn't watch or didn't read the notes, but Artifacts follow a different set of transmog rules. You can transmog your spec artifact appearance over ANY weapon/weapon set you are wielding while in that spec. It doesn't follow traditional transmog rules. They are aware some classes got special weapon types they don't normally get or get very few of and accounted for that already (Feral, Holy Pal, Etc).</div></div><hr />

Tbf, MoP was also done with grounded leveling in mind, yet they've now made it possible for players to fly there even through the leveling without needing those BMAH tomes... <br />

<br />
No I don't normally watch these things anymore since its usually cherry picked questions that don't interest me, not to mention I can't stand Ion for reasons. As for the notes, I read the three lines there, there's nothing about being able to transmog a staff into a claw and shield (for ele as example). Only that transmog is still &quot;spec locked&quot;. So if there's a separate list of notes somewhere, it'd be appreciated if you could link it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Legiondaries 2.0? Just instead of a badluck protection we're fully gated off of getting new gear? Not being a negative nancy but this sounds...Weird. Hope this isn't as game-y as it sounds, I liked the whole idea of Azerite gear just being set in stone traited gear which always drops in the same way so that there's actually some &quot;chase items&quot; outside of trinkets again. Tiersets and Legos are gone, we do need a carrot on a stick for most players to keep chasing.</div></div><hr />

This is ridiculous. Why must M+ and Raiding share the same reward pool? Mythic quality gear from the weekly chest is absurd. This basically confirms that I have to faceroll content other than Raiding in order to Raid better. I don't consider this to be OK, especially if you don't like M+.<br />

To progress as fast and efficiently possible, people feel forced into these things. I’m not saying people are forced, I’m saying they feel it, as m+ awards the same ilvl gear as raiding, which also skews gear acquisition as trinkets and armor pieces, and once again weapons, can roll better stats at equivalent ilvl as the raid people are working on.<br />
As I stated in other threads on similar topics, I don’t mind raiding=m+, but I think Blizz needs to separate them more and have raid gear not work in m+ and m+ not work in raids (think of loot I.d. and the pieces are scaled down).</div></div><hr />

How is that new? <br />
In classic the best items for many slots for most specs came from 5mans until mid AQ40/Naxx.<br />
In BC you had to play Arena for good weapons in T4&amp;5 AND cap your valor points in dungeons to fill slots you had bad luck in the raids with. Valor remained a factor until WoD.<br />
In WoD you had to clear a CM dungeon at the start of the xpack weekly.<br />
In Legion (&amp;BFA) you have to play ONE dungeon per week.<br />
<br />
So, for players like you it has always been &quot;worse&quot; than BFA/Legion except for WoD....and bringing the WoD model of &quot;absolutely nothing to do except raid once per week&quot; back would kill the game for the vast majority of players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or they could make better foundations. The reason why Maw of Souls was being run 24/7 was because it was the shortest run. If they scaled runs give rewards based on general length, with a slight weighting for more rewards from longer runs, we'd see a more even distribution of runs. Would some people still favor the shortest? Probably. <br />

To be fair, they did also say that the overall tuning of the run will be set up so you don't HAVE to switch gear sets. We'll see whether this is true or not in the actual execution of the design.</div></div><hr />

You'll still be on an RP server, meaning you can RP. If you want to PVP, you turn on war mode and pvp with people on your server. How is this bad? The only thing I can think of is if you're on a completely polarized server, with 99% of one faction.<br />

You'll still be on an RP server, meaning you can RP. If you want to PVP, you turn on war mode and pvp with people on your server. How is this bad? The only thing I can think of is if you're on a completely polarized server, with 99% of one faction.<br />
<br />
<br />
I like both but if I have to choose I like WPvP more than RP. If it was as simple as you are pretending then I would have just rolled on a PvE RP server, you can always just flag on any PvE server. It is not that simple which is why RP servers existed and why War Mode is made now. My server now is becoming a PvE RP server where you can just flag, not the RP-PvP server I rolled on. I rolled on my server because I wanted WPvP with a sizable population along with RP. If my server is being turned into a PvE server where you just flag and the War Mode sharding will not be active then I am clearly losing the thing I liked the most from my server. Hence why I don't like it.<br />

Hey, you brought it up and it. Don't post in a public forum if you don't want replies. That's what a blog is for. <br />
<br />
Honestly though, your complaint just doesn't sound valid. WPVP is still there. Just leave War Mode on 24/7. I guaranfuckintee you that other people will do the same. That's also why they were on an RPPVP server. The only real difference is you just won't even see people who aren't flagged. <br />
<br />
Basically it sounds like you're complaining about WPVP being decreased, which is something you don't have any evidence or reason to expect. Which, up until the post I just quoted, wasn't even made clear by your previous posts.</div></div><hr />

If you actually read player feed back and follow it all you end up with a shit game. Let me guess people that play mage think mage is weak and needs more. Let me guess people that don't like to raid don't think raids should have the best rewards. Let me guess people that only PVP think the game should be primarily balanced around PVP. The whole fan base is built themselves up as the center of the universe and thats why no one gives a shit about it. When I see the fan base going back to posts where they were dumb as a rock and wrong as could be and pointing out months later that this was the case then I will start to listen when they Monday morning quarterback the times they threw a 100 things at the wall and one of them stuck.</div></div><hr />

Except here the Game Director admits that enhancement and elemental have serious issues, but they won't be addressed until 8.1. Issues that players have been pointing out for months.<br />
<br />
What's even the fucking point of alpha/beta if Blizzard doesn't even fucking listen to the players invited? I got in back in April and I made 2 fairly long and detailed threads about issues with enhancement. Why are these issues just now being discussed by Blizzard?</div></div><hr />

So you got a choice. Re-roll. Quit. Or deal with it. I wanted a cheeseburger yesterday but the small town I was driving though didn't have a place to get it. I am sure others in this town have thought of getting a cheeseburger. But instead of laying waste to the town and burning it down I just got back into my car and put in an extra 20 minutes to the next down. 8.0 didn't have my cheeseburger. 8.1 had it. <br />
<br />

But the cheeseburger was top notch. Was amazing to wait until 8.1 for it. Would have even waited until 8.2. I guess we won't be seeing you in BFA.

It had extra cheese, bacon, and that perfect hit of mayo and mustard. A really outstanding 8.1 cheeseburger and it was perfect to wait for. I would have eatten it with Ion because he is top notch dev. I really respect and hope the best for him. The removal of master loot.. amazing change.

Are you talking about a new WoW expansion or a new in and out burger joint? <br />
<br />
Why do I have to pay for a burger when I havent eaten it yet and they are making me wait in line. Wouldnt I just wait for the burger to be done and grab it then? Seems a more logical approach and not very fun considering we are talking about games not damn burgers my man</div></div><hr />

The reason why Maw of Souls was being run 24/7 was because it was the shortest run. If they scaled runs give rewards based on general length, with a slight weighting for more rewards from longer runs, we'd see a more even distribution of runs. Would some people still favor the shortest? Probably. <br />
<br />
They absolutely CAN &quot;win&quot; this, they just have to stop taking the easy way out.<br />
<br />
You are missing the point. If it wasn't Maw it would have been another dungeon. People that were aiming for world first were going to farm anything and everything they could get their hands on to increase their power. By capping it in some fashion it takes that away. If they don't have some sort of cap you see what happens. The point isn't having an even distribution it was to curtail doing 40 dungeons a day.</div></div><hr />

You don't have too. If you want to bounce we all know where the door is. Trust me if I felt as strongly about this as other people do I would be long gone. I don't. I think Ion is taking the game i the perfect direction. So I stick around. The confusing part is the people that stick around, life around or about the game still, but then just endlessly complain.</div></div><hr />

In classic the best items for many slots for most specs came from 5mans until mid AQ40/Naxx.<br />
In BC you had to play Arena for good weapons in T4&amp;5 AND cap your valor points in dungeons to fill slots you had bad luck in the raids with. Valor remained a factor until WoD.<br />
In WoD you had to clear a CM dungeon at the start of the xpack weekly.<br />
In Legion (&amp;BFA) you have to play ONE dungeon per week.<br />
<br />
So, for players like you it has always been &quot;worse&quot; than BFA/Legion except for WoD....and bringing the WoD model of &quot;absolutely nothing to do except raid once per week&quot; back would kill the game for the vast majority of players.<br />
<br />
I won’t speak about classic or BC as I didn’t play back then; however, in WotLK this wasn’t even a factor. Clearing dungeonsater on was to get consumables for crafting. Cata/MoP/WoD were more of the same. Most dungeon crawling was to get tokens to buy offset pieces, something that turned out to be unnecessary as most of the time you had the slot piece just from the amount of time it took to save up for a piece. <br />
Legion turned the game upside down for dungeon crawling, as while you are technically correct with “1 a week,” it is also false in that there is a perceived idea of continuous grind for those WF/TF, as well as how fast you used to be able to grind out AP in m+. Come BfA, this trend continues with dungeon crawling and upgrades. <br />
I’m not saying “raid only,” I’m saying separate the 2. If people want to raid and do m+ they can, but don’t give the perception to the playerbase they have to do something to fill out their gear. Have all items be active in the world (including the warfront pvp aspect) but disable them in their counterparts.<br />
For players like me, I have had no issues with dungeons from WotLK up to Legion. I have never had to grind dungeons as much before Legion. As stated, some of that is probably reference AP and Legion acquisition on top of getting better gear, none of which I ever had to do before Legion started.</div></div><hr />

Why does that NEED to be curtailed, though? Top end cutting edge guilds are going to find something to spend their time on, regardless.

There's pros and cons to either way of doing it: <br />
<br />
On the one hand, by restricting War Mode on RP servers to JUST that server, you'll be able to build a reputation within a small enough community to gain recognition. <br />
<br />
But on the other hand, sharding with other, linked RP servers would create a much larger pool of potential PVP players. <br />
<br />
Personally, if I was a hardcore world PVP player, I'd be ecstatic about having War Mode be limited to just MY server. That goes back to the olden times of vanilla and TBC PVP servers where you could actually recognize a hated enemy, or get singled out as a priority target. &quot;Oh snap! It's [Arthazz]! That guy camped me yesterday for an hour! Time for revenge!&quot; Which is something you just don't get right now at all.</div></div><hr />

Definitely will be quite interesting to have it limited to just the server (or linked servers in the case of those). Guess it could kind of suck if your set of servers is dead though.

To be fair, that's not really what they said. They said no major changes, such as new talents / rotational changes. Then they specifically said that doesn't mean minor changes and balancing won't will still happen.<br />

I mean that guy couldn't have won anyways. Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't &quot;PvP&quot; servers the same as PvE servers now? If you want to PvP you flag in a capital city. In that scenario if the guy was on a RP realm he wouldn't see people who are flagged if he wasn't flagged and if he was on an old 'Rp-Pvp' server he wouldn't see people who didn't flag if he did flag.</div></div><hr />

Yes, exactly! And WHY do you think they did that? It's not because they care about the personal health of the players(nor is it any of their business in the first place). Do you just not see the direct connection between a monthly subscription business model and literally limiting how much the game can be played in each month?</div></div><hr />

Caps are horrible and limiting to those not trying to do crazy things. Where do you cap? If it's too low you block normal people out. If it's too high it doesn't matter anyway.<br />
<br />
Besides, we're talking people who with 3-5+ geared alts by the time raiding opens anyway, M+ grinding is the least of their worries. I just don't want MY gameplay impeded upon because they do crazy things.</div></div><hr />

K keep telling yourself that. I'll continue to support something that provides me entertainment for my dollar. Well since I've not had to pay for anything Blizz related since MoP I think my zero dollars is providing me plenty of entertainment. If I didn't enjoy the game I'd stop playing, simple as that. I've seen games that have no hard caps (EverQuest) and just how far some people are willing to go for an edge, I thought it was a bit silly to have endless AP grinding in dungeons so I wasn't sad to see it go away.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SirCowdog</div><div class="date">2018-06-15, 04:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Definitely will be quite interesting to have it limited to just the server (or linked servers in the case of those). Guess it could kind of suck if your set of servers is dead though. But still, even at that, RP servers always fight to maintain their identity, if he thought it would be any different then this it's his own fault.<br />
<br />
Which is why I suspect that Blizzard will inevitably have to link servers that are too heavily populated on one side or the other. Either that or start implementing Wintergrasp-style counter-buffs for the faction that's the underdog. And that's been shown to be pretty ineffective. Linking to a server with the opposite population issue will be a much better solution that RP-PVPers are going to have to accept.</div></div><hr />

I THINK he's worried about population? Idk really, but on non-rp servers your PVP pop is going to be higher, it's just the way it is when you can pull in more.</div></div><hr />

Do you just not see the direct connection between a monthly subscription business model and literally limiting how much the game can be played in each month?<br />
<br />
I think it WAS partly because of personal health of the players. And sorry, there is plenty of other things for people to do in the game besides mindlessly farm AP, they limited one aspect of the game. That's it.</div></div><hr />

I don't play shaman, so unless Shaman can't be fixed via some small tweaks and a solid pass of tuning, then likely they will be alright until pre-raid patch. If not, then that sucks.<br />
<br />
Shaman DPS of both specs have pretty significant problems with talents, survivability, and utility. Elemental has issues with mobility as well on top of that. Enhancement has major issues with AoE.<br />
<br />
It's basically the squishiest DPS in the game with no utility to speak of. Even if they were both made top DPS specs they still wouldn't be desired because they'd bring nothing else and would die more often than other DPS.</div></div><hr />

Well, yes, it's been an ongoing issue. The problem is now with more emphasis on class utility shamans just fall even more behind since they bring nothing but Heroism/Bloodlust which can be brought by mages and hunters as well who have better survivability and more utility.</div></div><hr />

Could be a thing, not entirely sure, don't really remember cause the damn Q&amp;A got so boring I started zoning lol. But they'll still spam it for gear, it's just too good of gear to pass up, but at least they'll be spamming 10s and not 1-2s like the start of legion.</div></div><hr />

Right? Moonkins say hi. Don't ele shammy still have Astral Shift which is just flat out better than barkskin as well as having about as much armor with a shield? I just went and checked on the beta and that seems to be pretty close to the case armor wise. I know enh has Astral Shift as well but I'm not sure if they have anything else to compensate for the loss of a shield.<br />

I guess you don't count reincarnation as utility. Because you should since it is a powerful tool. Don't forget Wind Rush Totem which I think has been improved from the Legion version. There is Earth Shield which Ele and Enh both have. Until numbers are tuned I can't say if that will be any good or not. Enh also gets Ancestral Guidance if they don't like Wind Rush Totem. They have Capacitor Totem which is a 1 min cd AoE stun with 35 yard placing range. Don't forget Purge...<br />
<br />
The fuck are you going on about that Shaman are lacking in utility<br />

I rather wish Blizz would restrict War Mode to your own servers even outside of RP mode, as I wouldn't mind that old feel. Considering how much Blizz screams &quot;server identity! server identity!&quot; when it comes to mythic raiding being realm only, they're pretty set on combining all servers for everything else to the point where server identity really isn't a thing anymore. Feels more like a convenient excuse rather than something Blizz really wishes to preserve.</div></div><hr />

Reincarnation is a significantly worse version of Cheat Death on a 30 minute cooldown that doesn't reset on raid wipe. It's a flavor ability more than it is utility.<br />
<br />
lolearthshield<br />
<br />
Enhancement doesn't have Ancestral Guidance.<br />
<br />
Most classes have stuns. Stuns are also rarely useful in raiding.<br />
<br />
Wind Rush Totem is a worse version of Stampeding Roar.<br />
<br />
So, what do shamans bring that other classes don't bring a better version of? Why bring the squishy shaman over the mage or druid who can do the same things, but better and die less?</div></div><hr />

Shaman being squishy in the past doesn't mean it wasn't still a problem then as well as now. Just sayin...<br />
<br />
There are a lot odds and ends:<br />
<br />
Many talent rows are a mess. This is partly due to balancing, but also due to major design flaws.<br />
Since Storm Strike was reverted to physical it hits for not much more than Lava Lash and even if buffed will suffer once more from scaling issues due to our mastery. Rotation does not flow quite as well as it used to be. <br />
AoE is even worse than in Legion and the single target prio cleave niche has been weakened a lot with the removal of the artifact traits.<br />
Raid utility is lacking (dungeon utility is actually in a good spot).<br />
And with the introduction of M+ being squishy has become an even bigger problem as ever before. Especially with the loss of Prydaz. Why take a squishy single target class in M+ if you can pick a tanky AoE god?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Might have forgotten something, but this should give you a general idea. I think the class could be made playable before release, but to really fix it will need more time.<br />
<br />
I am actually far more worried about Shadow Priest at this point...</div></div><hr />

Some classes have stuns, some of them don't have AoE stuns and even fewer of them have ranged AoE stuns. Also there is more to the game than just raiding such as PvP, World PvP, M+, world content. Think of more than just yourself.<br />
<br />
Wind Rush Totem does not have the restrictions that Stamp Roar does. You do realize that Stampeding Roar is extremely short range (15 yards from the feral/guardian druid who used it) instead of running through a totem or having the totem placed on you. Also the totem lasts longer than the roar does. <br />

There's a lot that needs to be done, there's no excuse for them just blowing it off now since feedback has been given since beta was more widely available back in Feb though.

Reincarnation is a 30 minute cooldown. It's not utility, it's a flavor ability. It's worse than Ice Block or Divine Shield or Cheat Death with a significantly longer cooldown.<br />
<br />
I'm talking about PvE content. Raiding and mythic+ are both parts of PvE content. If shamans were in a good place for M+ they would have been involved in the invitational, but they weren't. BfA is doing nothing to change that.<br />
<br />
I actually play an enhancement shaman. I know what it's like. I've played beta, I know what that's like. I know what issues enhancement has and I'm really frustrated that Blizzard isn't going to touch things until 8.1 for a class that already had issues in live.</div></div><hr />

Not entirely sure how &quot;entitlement&quot; fits into your piss poor attempt at an insult besides being lazy enough to use a random buzzword, but the other person said I didn't watch it or read the notes. I however did read the notes and what the other player said is just a &quot;well he said...&quot; thing, which he (Ion) has gone back on before with other issues. <br />

<br />
I would love to main a pally, but I can't handle their slow movement speed. That horse on long-ish cooldown isn't enough. Used to be you could equip Aggramar's stride, but that's going away(or at least getting super-nerfed) in BfA. I hate to say it, but I think I might have to break down and play a demon hunter. Druid is fun, but there's only so much animal forms I can handle.</div></div><hr />

You complain about shit in raids, then the Mythic Invitational as if that is some amazing representation of what the player base is doing in the game. Reincarnation is still utility despite what you think of it. I'm glad you stopped complaining about the other utility I pointed out for you. <br />

Stop wasting my time, thanks.<br />

This just underlines the feeling I have from the current BETA-builds that the game doesn't feel all that polished. They have 1 month, tops, before they have to move into release candidates / golden master builds and still the BETA feels like what Mists of Pandaria, Warlords of Draenor and Legion did 2-3 months before release.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying the expansion will be bad, but it seems like they are rushing it all? Why paint yourself into this corner? Why announce a release date this early just to end up with having so little time to finish and polish everything before release? They should have delayed the release for 1-2 months and get everything neat and tidy for release instead of start pushing things back to 8.1.<br />
<br />
It's not very reassuring to have the lead developer saying stuff like this in interviews with less than a month before they start having to push release candidate builds. They are still experimenting with a bunch of stuff when this late in the development cycle should be all about polish, optimisation and bug squeezing.</div></div><hr />

Considering how much Blizz screams &quot;server identity! server identity!&quot; when it comes to mythic raiding being realm only, they're pretty set on combining all servers for everything else to the point where server identity really isn't a thing anymore. Feels more like a convenient excuse rather than something Blizz really wishes to preserve.<br />
<br />
Probably the issue with that is that it would show 'how' dead some of the servers are.</div></div><hr />

I'm talking about PvE content. Raiding and mythic+ are both parts of PvE content. If shamans were in a good place for M+ they would have been involved in the invitational, but they weren't. BfA is doing nothing to change that.<br />

I actually play an enhancement shaman. I know what it's like. I've played beta, I know what that's like. I know what issues enhancement has and I'm really frustrated that Blizzard isn't going to touch things until 8.1 for a class that already had issues in live.<br />

Give up. This guy thinks ankh is utility and powerful and he thinks that astral shift is better then barkskin, yet completly forgets that druids have Bearform which lets them survive &quot;everything&quot; in my+ without a cooldown.<br />

Ahh man, you know you could just quote me if you're going to try and insult me in such a fashion. Fun fact Astral Shift IS better than barkskin. Go and compare the tooltips and get back to me. Druids only have a strong bear form if they are guardian affinity and don't forget this is also being NERFED in BfA but you probably don't know that because you sure as hell aren't a druid on a level above heroic raids and mythic+15. (I love twisting people's words right back at them like this.)<br />

Sorry that you think ankh isn't utility, if you want you can petition for them to remove it for ya.<br />

<br />
<br />
Druid-<br />
Barkskin- 1 min CD lasts 12 seconds and provides 20% damage reduction.<br />
Frenzied Regen- MUST shift into bear to activate this, must also maintain bear form the entire time if you want the full heal. Heals you for 30% of max health over 4 seconds (in its current form). The moment you leave bear form Frenzied Regen turns off. Shifting to bear form gives an increase in stamina for max health and an increase in armor. <br />
<br />
Shaman-<br />
(Enh and Ele)Astral Shift- 1.5 min CD lasts 8 seconds and provides 40% damage reduction. <br />
<br />
(Elemental only)Primal Elementalist (Talent) Harden Skin- You can use this to make your Earth Elemental provide a 40% damage reduction for 10 seconds to YOU and the Earth Elemental. This is a 5 minute cooldown for the Earth Elemental so the 1 min cooldown on the ability is irrelevant. <br />
<br />
Both specs have the option of taking a talent that can provide a heal in Nature's Guardian for shaman and Renewal for moonkins and there is no point in comparing the healing potency of our spells yet as those tuning passes haven't happened.<br />
<br />
<br />
So Elemental shamans can have 2 damage reduction cooldowns if they wish, huh. I wonder if you even knew about the Earth Elemental one.</div></div><hr />

You fucking ruined mythic plus. Idc if majority doesnt swap gear. As a tank I consistently use 5-6 different sets in dungeons. Some sets are tailored to specific bosses which puts it beyond 5-6<br />
I think &quot;ruined&quot; is too strong a word here. But I am going to miss swapping between two drastically different gear setups as well. The removal of Legion legendaries should lessen the blow, though. Without considering those, it'll just be a difference in secondary stats and trinkets.</div></div><hr />

He said it was based on player feedback. Feedback which has been primarily about utility, survivability, or the slowness of resource generation and RNG reliant nature of the rotation. And mobility for elemental specifically.<br />

<br />
You basically very rudely demanded an explanation as if I owed you one. Though for the sake of the conversation I assumed you didn't mean to sound rude and humored you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly though, your complaint just doesn't sound valid. WPVP is still there. Just leave War Mode on 24/7. I guaranfuckintee you that other people will do the same. That's also why they were on an RPPVP server. The only real difference is you just won't even see people who aren't flagged. <br />
<br />
Basically it sounds like you're complaining about WPVP being decreased, which is something you don't have any evidence or reason to expect. Which, up until the post I just quoted, wasn't even made clear by your previous posts.<br />
Actually I do have evidence. If you grab a server where every single person in it is permanently flagged and remove that flag to give them the choice to flag or not then invariably the amount of people flagged for WPvP will decrease unless 100% of the players in the server decide to turn it on. Which will not happen. It only takes one person to not flag when this change happens to prove you wrong. Logically it will be a lot more than one person.<br />
<br />
War Mode would be the solution to this if it worked in RP servers the same way it will for non-RP servers. That is exactly the problem I pointed out, it won't work the same. It will not grab War Mode people and get them in a shard, it will only work as a pvp flag as it is right now on PvE servers. Which as I explained already if you change a server where everyone is perma-flagged to a server where people only opt to flag, the WPvP population will decrease no matter how you want to put it. Just like how people roll on RP servers because they want to engage in RP with many other people, some roll in RP-PvP servers because they want to RP and engage in WPvP with many others.<br />
<br />
If RP servers were to be removed I wouldn't tell people &quot;You can always just run around with TRP on 24/7. I garantee other people will do the same.&quot; because that is just ridiculous. Having TRP on all the time is not the same as being in an RP server. Turning on a PvP flag in a PvE server is not the same as being in a PvP server. RP-PvP servers are getting screwed over and my issue is that Ion just now decided to stop being coy and vague and finally gave a fucking answer two fucking months away from release. Would have been nicer to said it sooner so people who care about War Mode could start transferring or leveling alts in advance.</div></div><hr />
