I think the time portion of your target date was wrong? I think it was actually adjusting for timezones - some people saw 11 hours, others 8, but your target date was off.<br />
<br />
Edit: Ah I see, yeah you're right. Might want to slap the start time up there in EST for the heck of it.</div></div><hr />

who is wrong??<br />
<br />
They let people in in an hour but the actual opening ceremony's in two?<br />
<br />
Tempor: my guess is the earliest we'll see it is a bit over 2 hours from now (after seeing and digesting the opening ceremony). Possibly someone will get into the hall in 1hr and see something incriminating and take a snapshot with their cellphone camera or something.</div></div><hr />

Boub is there and still making site adjustments. I don't think there will be that much delay on the important stuff being listed on the front page. Cell phone reception in the hall is crap at times, though. Like, you'll have full bars and then you'll have no service.</div></div><hr />

But about the schedule and the stream schedule... there isnt nearly all the wow panels in the stream schedule.. so will they record it and put it up for &quot;on demand&quot; or somthing? Cause its just not a virtual ticket if you can only see select parts of the event... ;P atleast in my opinion</div></div><hr />

When you first open it up it is set to high quality. If you're problems try lowering the quality. It might be a problem with your computer or connection if you still can't get it. They are showing things right now, even though it's just repeats of the WotLK and Starcraft 2 cinematics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Try disabling temporarily on both your PC and Router as a test, if all goes well you than need to work out which firewall is causing the issue and make the exception there.<br />
<br />
As for the IT technician at work i would really reconcider your position if you have not realised that the stream as working on NAT'ing.</div></div><hr />

Its a NAT'ing issue on your PC or Router firewall.<br />

Temporarily disable them and relaunch the viewer.</div></div><hr />

Same here.. The testing 2 weeks ago worked like a charm (both high and low). Now even low is constantly buffering. I don't think we'll ever see our money back though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps that's why it's all buffering to shit on the high quality stream :(<br />

When I installed it, it ate up all my upload bandwidth and killed my download performance. And there's no way to limit upload speed. That caused the video to just buffer a lot, and prevent me from using my internet for anything else.<br />
<br />
Don't bother. The low quality flash stream looks plenty good, consumes less bandwidth, and I can still use my internet.</div></div><hr />

It should have been free in the first place. The least Blizzard could do for all the poor saps who didn't get their refresh in during the .0000000000001 secs window you had to get a place in the queue close enough to buy a ticket.</div></div><hr />

edit: chris is explaining deathwing and how they got steel plates on him to prevent his body from tearing apart due to his immense power and the old gods corrupting him , sorry , typing this as he talks so it's not very clear.<br />
<br />
he is now talking about how deathwing's violent eruption into azeroth caused the cataclysm , also hinting that westfall might not change, with a smile on his face , a joke maybe?</div></div><hr />

Go to http://blizzcon.rayv.com<br />
<br />
And copy-paste this into your browser url window:<br />
<br />
javascript:Rayv.Embed(&quot;rayvHost&quot;, {&quot;Affiliate&quot;: &quot;DTVblizzcon&quot;, &quot;ChannelID&quot;: &quot;blizzl3&quot;, &quot;Volume&quot;: &quot;100&quot;, &quot;CoverImageURL&quot;: &quot;http://static.blizzcon.rayv.com/www/Images/rayv_viewer_install.jpg&quot; });<br />
<br />
The official stream should replace the test video.<br />
<br />
Note: don't hit 'high quality' or it'll go back to the trailer. The low quality stream is actually higher quality than the high quality stream.<br />
<br />
<br />
