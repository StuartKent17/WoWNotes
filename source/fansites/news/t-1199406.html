Paladin and Priest Challenge Mode Gear Procs<br />
Tonight we take a look at a little bit more flare for the Challenge Mode gear! Each set has a special proc that will go off during combat or other actions. Some of the sets even have multiple procs or slight variations depending on what you are casting. <br />
<br />
You can find the Challenge Mode set previews on our Challenge Mode Gear page (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/932-Challenge-Mode-Armor-Sets), found in the menu in the navbar. Each class has a proc for their set, so keep checking back to see your class's set! <br />

Developer Interviews<br />
The developers are doing interviews as we get closers to launch, so here is a recap from the first few. Thanks to ArenaJunkies (http://www.arenajunkies.com/news/535-the-arena-junkies-pvp-interview-with-greg-ghostcrawler-street/), Gamespy (http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/world-of-warcraft-mists-of-pandaria/1226130p1.html), and wowcrendor (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dddMQBkjyFc&amp;feature=youtu.be).<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
<br />
Patch 5.1 will release &quot;shortly after the game is out&quot;.<br />
Phasing is only used for major events in Mists of Pandaria.<br />
You can see your friends while in a different phase and each of you will see a different phase. <br />
It will take a raid of roughly 40 players to take down the Sha of Anger. He will appear in different areas of the zone and change what is spawned around him. <br />
Scenarios are a replacement for group quests that you won't have to wait in queue for a long time for.<br />
Challenge Modes will require you to be on the same server as other players. (This conflicts with Ghostcrawler's tweet (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/245547847683031040))<br />
Questing is less linear and you should be able to skip some of the quest hubs without missing too much of the story. Jade Forest is more linear than the rest of the zones. <br />
The daily quests that are available change every day and change based on your reputation with the faction. <br />
You have a NPC companion that fights alongside you when doing Shado-pan daily quests.<br />
Cataclysm was more content than had ever been done before because of the 1 to 60 revamp, but many people just looked at the 80 to 85 experience. <br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
<br />
Blizzard follows the player run and professional tournaments, but realizes that it is a hard to watch eSport and is hard to watch. It isn't likely that arenas will be as popular as Starcraft ever, but the goal is to make them fun for the players are are interested in playing. <br />
The addition of a tournament UI is still on the list of things that would be nice to do as soon as there is development time for it. <br />
Rating decay may not be the best solution, especially during longer patches like 4.3 when people may not be interested in playing every week. Players should play because they enjoy it and not avoid playing because they might lose rating. <br />
The current rewards system is working well and the improvements to PvP gear through PvP Power and Resilience should make the gear more attractive.<br />
The battleground queuing system is old and could use work, it may take advantage of the LFD system and perform faster and smarter in the future. This could include queuing with groups to fight other premades. <br />
Blizzard believes that the PvP weapons will be stronger than the heroic PvE weapons due to the PvP stat changes. <br />
Many players are worried that overpowered abilities will allow players to reach high rating within the first two weeks and camp it for the rest of the season. Whether or not Blizzard makes huge sweeping changes is just going to depend on the magnitude of the problem, as it really upsets players and can seem unfair after they have already formed teams and started playing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler (Misc)<br />
<br />
If Ghostcrawler could change one thing about Cataclysm, he would move all the zones into one continent. The teleporting between zones didn't feel like WoW should. <br />
Cross-Realm zones were designed to fix lower level zones that are dead, not low population realms. The game isn't likely to support people that want to opt out of Cross-Realm zones.<br />
A Cross-Realm Auction House has been talked about, but it would be hard to do it right and dynamically. It is something being considering for the lowest population realms though. <br />
Cooking has been improved for Mists of Pandaria. Similar changes might come to other professions depending on player feedback.<br />
Fishing still isn't where it should be. Making it more like minigame or adding more complexity to the system might be solutions in the future. <br />
Burning Crusade raid progression went through all of the content, but Wrath of the Lich King made old raids obsolete quickly after each patch. Mists of Pandaria uses Raid Finder to keep older content relevant to gear up alts for new content. <br />
Gearing up was too fast for alts or people returning in Cataclysm and WotLK, so in Mists of Pandaria characters that are still working on normal modes when a new raid tier comes out should want to still complete the final bosses before moving on to the new raid. Burning Crusade took too long to gear up new players, making it necessary for them to go through all of the old raids. <br />
Players expected Theramore to be a big event, rather than a preview of how the Scenario system works. It was a systems preview and not an event. <br />
Scenarios have no tank, so you have to rely on your own skills a little bit more compared to dungeons and raids. <br />
Making challenge modes for raids is difficult because of length of raids compared to dungeons. They also make trash important, as it is much more difficult in challenge mode. Even in heroic difficulty raids the trash isn't very difficult. <br />
<br />

Battle Chest and Wrath of the Lich King - Together at Last!<br />
Haven’t yet ventured to the frozen reaches of Northrend? Beginning today, September 19, players are now able to get the original World of Warcraft, The Burning Crusade, and Wrath of the Lich King for only $19.99 (EU: €14.99) as part of the newly upgraded digital Battle Chest, available now on Battle.net (https://us.battle.net/login/en/?ref=https%3A%2F%2Fus.battle.net%2Faccount%2Fmanagement%2Fupgrade-wow.html&amp;app=bam&amp;cr=true). In addition, all World of Warcraft subscribers will now automatically have access to all of the content and features of both The Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King, even if they never purchased either expansion, at no additional cost.<br />
<br />
It’s time to sail north, adventurer — the Lich King awaits! <br />

Cross Realm Fishing Derby<br />
We’ve looked into this issue and have a fix in the works to make the fishing tournaments behave in a more predictable manner. Unfortunately, this will require a patch in order to take effect, so we are disabling the fishing tournaments until we can deliver the fix for them in a future patch.<br />
<br />
As a side-note: we’ll be posting about some larger CRZ concerns in the very near future, so hang in there. We’re listening, and we’re working to address those concerns just as quickly as we can.

<br />
Scenario Difficulty<br />
Just read a quick word on scenarios @ mmo from blizzard twitter, where i became rather.. confused by a certain statement<br />
<br />
&quot;Scenarios aren't intended to be particularly challenging endgame content. Similar to old group quests&quot;<br />
<br />
No one is asking for endgame content difficulty, however facerolling through trash for 5 minutes can't be considered challenging in any way. Old group quests such as ring of blood in nagrand actually required certain tactics back in burning crusade, you couldnt just faceroll the elite mobs, some had certain tactics, one ressurected, one absorbed spelldamage and did more damage to the tank ect.. none of this exists in the theramore scenario.<br />
<br />
We agree that Theramore's Fall was too easy, which is why we have increased the HP of all enemies in this scenario through a recent hotfix. It is not our intent that scenarios should be steamrolled like what we saw with the release of Theramore's Fall.<br />
<br />
It should be said that scenarios in Mists of Pandaria will be more tuned for players in quest gear and dungeon blues, and as such will not be tailored for players in raid gear. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/236617-devs-about-scenarios/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/5348645974?page=2#35))<br />
<br />
Challenging Content In Mists of Pandaira<br />
Regarding challenge modes specifically, there're a few bits of information that the developers have commented over the past days on live chats and social media, which I believe might be interesting for you:<br />
<br />
Challenge modes have no lockout (so you can try them as many times as you want in a single day).<br />
These are harder than level 90 heroics, you can't outgear them (gear will be normalized inside), and certain things, such as set bonuses will not work. Trinkets do, though. At least for now.<br />
The developers hope that the time required to get &quot;gold&quot; in challenge dungeons is similar to achieving Gladiator in PVP. Meaning, someone sporting a whole set of challenge gear should be akin to seeing someone in a Gladiator mount.<br />
<br />
<br />
The theory is that challenge modes will fill this niché, but if past experience is anything to go by it will either be too easy or will be subjected to nerfs. Still, can always hope.<br />
The developers have commented this several times. They do expect that most players will be able to achieve Bronze as long as they play properly. Silver is a step up in that regard, but you might still be able to stop and consider your next move before further progressing on the instance.<br />
<br />
And finally, the design philosophy for challenge dungeons is so that the developers don't intend to lower the bar to get silver/gold.<br />
<br />
Problem with challenge mode is it is restricted to 5 man. 25man guilds will have to pick the best and make groups. If this was in raiding part of wow then yes players would be happy.<br />
Well, on raiding, as it's been mentioned on the thread, you'll be awarded a Feat of Strength for defeating the final bosses of each raid instance without the debuff. And the Protectors of the Endless encounter in Terrace of Endless Spring has even better loot if you defeat Protector Kaolan last (which makes the encounter harder, in a similar way as it happened with the Iron Council in Ulduar depending on your kill order).

OT priest set looks good, looking forward to working towards that on my new priest main. although i kinda thought the shadow spells should've had a shadow effect rather than holy . . .<br />
<br />
i dont really get why paladin melee abilities have a different effect . . .</div></div><hr />

these people have tried suing every multiplayer game they can. they claim they have a patent on the idea of having an online world in any way that allows different players to come into the same world an interact online.</div></div><hr />

I found Pico to be far more striking in all ways. Her awkwardness was a pleasure to watch, and it made her more believable as the girl that would actually be willing to hang out with nerds. The new girl looks like the type who tortured me during lunch hour with her jock buddies.</div></div><hr />

It doesnt really matter when someone gets a patent, all that matters is who owns that patent. If someone invents something and is too stupid to patent it then someone else can come along and steal it, that's how america works.<br />

Courts often make rulings with statements of how the individual ruling should not be used as a direct precedent for winning future cases, therefore you push the biggest case first in case you can't make everybody pay<br />
<br />
so Pico v Lindsay v Casey... How is Casey &quot;better than all three&quot; when he is among the three? o.O<br />
<br />
her name is Lindsay Ferguson according to credits on screen, but video title and what she says in some videos is &quot;Lindsay Geektron&quot;<br />
<br />
of note: she didn't do a &quot;curse weekly roundup&quot; she did Blizzard weekly news and previously a Minecraft weekly update, so there's no reason they all can't have a job doing different videos</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not entirely true, in theory you cannot patent something that someone else has already invented, lawyer types often refer to it as &quot;prior art&quot;. Since they filed this patent back in 1995 (at least I thought that's what they said), I imagine Blizzard will counter with the fact that MUDDs (text based MMOs for those too young to have played one) existed long before 1995. <br />
<br />
That being said, the US Patent Office has shown that they have no problem what-so-ever with granting patents for things that already exist. For example Twitter is being sued over a patent that was just filed last December, yet the technology they are being sued over they have used for years.<br />
<br />
All in all, the patent system is so ridiculously broken at this point, its anyone's guess as to what will happen.</div></div><hr />

That's because even the people who didn't buy Cataclysm or were playing to level 20 for free got to see the revamp. Those that bought it didn't necessarily give a shit about the older content. Case in point, while I was subbed to the game, I didn't bother leveling an alt from the start at all.
