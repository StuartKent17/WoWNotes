Blue Tweets<br />
Buried within the data mines, a dark shadow stirs, its breath a bitter chill that brings with it promises of riches... and promises of destruction. A cry rings out, distant but clear. A signal of shock and fear, met with lost hope, and somehow... relief? We must dig deeper. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/963539905828700160))<br />

This Week in WoW History<br />
We're taking a look back at old MMO-Champion posts and World of Warcraft news that occurred during this time in previous years.<br />
<br />
Break The Trees<br />
Singer/songwriter Sharm was featured in a blue post after the release of her latest song “Break The Trees”. The verses of this song were comprised of talent names from Warcraft. Sharm has been creating WoW Parody videos for the past 10 years and is still active on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/user/taintedlore).<br />
<br />

<br />
Iron Man Challenge<br />
2012 marked the beginning of the Iron Man Challenge. This became one of the most popular challenges to date after a few players gave it a shot. The objective is simple - reach level cap. However, doing it within the confines of the rules is the difficult part. Players are not allowed to use and talents, class specializations, professions, enchants, stat-improved gear or the assistance of other players. The most important rule is that if your character dies at all the challenge is over.<br />
<br />

<br />
Patch 5.4.7<br />
This late Mists of Pandaria patch began the preparation for the new expansion Warlords of Draenor. The patch marked the beginning of the last PvP season of the expansion, added the Level 90 character boost, updated the launcher and added the Collector’s Edition mount/pet to the files.<br />
<br />

<br />
Graphical Features<br />
Patch 6.1 introduced a handful of new graphical settings to improve the quality of the game. Official colorblind support for Protanopia, Deuteranopia and Tritanopia were added along with a strength adjuster. The graphics tab also got a few new options including the addition of HBAO+ for screen space ambient occlusion (SSAO), a variety of settings for Anti-Aliasing and improved point light settings.<br />
<br />

<br />
Death Knight Animations<br />
Patch 7.2 added new animations to Howling Blast, Death Grip and Death and Decay. A few undocumented changes were also made to the casting animations of abilities such as Remorseless Winter, Blood Boil and Apocalypse. The initial Death and Decay particles were also changed shortly after the update due to players having issues seeing the affected area when cast on certain terrain.<br />

<br />
Going Casual<br />
Top end mythic raiding in Legion, especially in the Nighthold, started to cause issues in certain guilds. The required time investment to stay at the top was too much, causing guilds to either go casual or stop raiding altogether. Most notably From Scratch and SNF announced that they would stop, while Midwinter also called it quits after defeating Grand Magistrix Elisande, with the intention of going casual.<br />

<br />
World of Warcraft: Chronicle Volume 2<br />
The second Chronicle book was previewed on IGN, giving us a few teasers about what we should anticipate from the graphic novel. This book series was written to tell the story of Warcraft and everything it entails. Volume 1 covered everything from creation until the rise of humanity, while Volume 2 tells us the story of Ancient Draenor. Currently the Chronicle series is set to release Volume 3 on March 27, 2018.<br />

<br />
You lot bitching about leveling now, how about try leveling when you had no heirlooms to speed up your leveling or anything like that, and one of the only ways to go faster back then was the rested XP bonus.. <br />
<br />
No idea why you lot even play MMO's if you hate the leveling process so much, as it is part in parcel of any and all MMO's..</div></div><hr />

Now we need to actually play the game we are paying to play? NANI?!?!<br />
<br />

Considering you actually spend the most time on your Character at the Max level bracket, slowing down the leveling system restricts players from playing what they are actually paying to play, which is for most of the population the current Expansion.<br />

Comparing a shit system to worse shit system doesn't mean you should overlook the shit system.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't work like that though. You cannot pick &amp; choose like &quot;this is what I am paying to play / ehh this is not&quot;. Leveling &amp; endgame content are both parts of the same game. If you have a max level character you get to experience endgame content. If you do not have a max level character or if your max level character is not the race/class combo you want - you will have to level one. These should be obvious but apparently they aren't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
P.S. If you sign for random dungeon you can complete 3-4 per/h, with high lvl friend you can still complete 10/h so (bonus for sign*1.15 +bonus from dungeon + kills (mobs*300) vs bonus from dungeon + kills (mobs*300)... IMO having friend still wins it will be only slower, again ... so go and buy boots for $$</div></div><hr />

Dungeons with a 110 was never worth it, it always reduced your XP gain by too much. Was only worth it if you were RAFing with someone else and a 110 was running you through a dungeon. Where is your &quot;always&quot; coming from?</div></div><hr />

So I completely wasted my time leveling for over 50 hours...Nah. I wouldn't think of it like that. The only way to 'win' this game is to have fun. Did you have fun? If so, you're winning. I mean, you could look at ALL time spent playing a video game as &quot;wasted&quot;.

<br />
I have been asking for a leveling system like this for many years. I have no desire to buy a boost. How am I being nickel and dimed? I'm not nieve, I understand the financial motivation for doing this. On one part, they are cashing in on the player base that only cares about 110 and the quickest possible way to get there. On the other hand, they're keeping players that actually like the *slightly*slower leveling system who care more about the journey than the destination. <br />
<br />
And yeah, slightly. It's absolutely not as bad as most of you are making this out to be. But lots of players are now spoiled, that's where this reaction is coming from. You want results in as little time as humanly possible with the least effort exerted. <br />
<br />
To me, that contradicts an RPG or a good MMORPG. But feel free to voice your opinions. Me and my level 17 warrior are having the best time ever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Leveling pre-7.3.5 with heirlooms and dungeon spam took maybe 20-30 hours for most people. That's not &quot;instant rewards&quot;, people just don't want to have to put in twice the amount of time to level an alt as they have to do now. <br />
<br />
They did not make leveling more challenging or more exciting, only slower. If you spend thousands of gold on heirlooms/xp pots/RaF, why should you have to spend so much more time to level now compared to the past 5-7 years?</div></div><hr />

<br />
(Leveling is part of the game, there are pretty horrible examples out there -like some Korean MMOs- and WoW's' is childplay compared to those. If you feel the need to experience a certain race/class combo at max level, you have to level it. Suck it up)<br />
<br />
You know that before 7.3.5 you could level with dungeons or with questing. Both have been equally viable in my view. I usually mixed questing with running dungeons, depending on dungeons available and if I liked them, and what zones I could quest in, and if I liked these. Especially when you level tank or healer characters, it's a much better experience to do this in dungeons, because you can actually play the intended role for that character. If dungeons are viable now, then things only return to the intended design.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you don't understand the definition of the word &quot;minority&quot;, because the person in the minority is most likely the person on alt 47. I'm an altoholic and I only have 8 max level toons, for example.<br />
<br />
<br />
Leveling through old expansions instead of the current one is not playing the Current game. People that want people to spend more time in Old content are idiots.<br />
<br />
Or maybe instead of idiots they're.... new players (god forbid!) or people that enjoy the leveling experience (remember kids, fun is subjective!).<br />
<br />
The &quot;current&quot; game is Legion plus everything else that is available. Or have they implemented something that stops me from farming old instances/bosses for mounts etc.? <br />
<br />
I don't understand why it's so hard to grasp the concept of what one person considers fun isn't necessarily the same as what another person considers fun. Continued ignorance around this coupled with fallacy-laden statements to try to pass off opinion as fact or that one's opinion is shared by the majority are tired and weak.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nobody is being &quot;nickle and dimed&quot;. They have always hotfixed methods of leveling that were too fast. The players are the people that wanted leveling to take longer so Blizzard gave it to them. There were going to be people happy about the changes and people not happy about the changes no matter which way Blizzard changed the process. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean Blizzard is out to get you. <br />
<br />
The funny thing about all of this though is that the leveling doesn't really feel slower anyway. Level scaling allows people to stay in zones until they're fully completed so I can see that contributing to the feeling of things taking longer but if you remember, people almost never leveled with quests before, it was all dungeons. I've been leveling with two other friends lately using the same old dungeon method and we've been blowing through levels. This entire thing just seems like an excuse for people to complain about something.</div></div><hr />

This hotfix doesn't just apply to level 110s running lowbies through say, Stockades. It also applies when a level 110 queues for a normal Legion dungeon, or even when a level 58 DK queues for LFD and gets put into Stockades. <br />

<br />
The whole game philosophy is rushing through content. You can mount up at level 1, or even if you don't your character runs 20% faster than originally designed. You can throw in an ability cast every second. You can suddenly enter a dungeon for an area you've never been near before. You are rewarded experience for losing in battlegrounds, for your participation I guess. <br />
<br />
Theres not one thing in this game that promotes the idea of taking your time and enjoying the content; except this tiny change. <br />
<br />
And in my view, it cant be pulled off unless you make all aspects of the game slower.</div></div><hr />

They just increased the time a bit. They did not up the difficulty in any way other than the odd elite because they already hit like a truck.<br />

There were going to be people happy about the changes and people not happy about the changes no matter which way Blizzard changed the process. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean Blizzard is out to get you. <br />
<br />
The funny thing about all of this though is that the leveling doesn't really feel slower anyway. Level scaling allows people to stay in zones until they're fully completed so I can see that contributing to the feeling of things taking longer but if you remember, people almost never leveled with quests before, it was all dungeons. I've been leveling with two other friends lately using the same old dungeon method and we've been blowing through levels. This entire thing just seems like an excuse for people to complain about something.<br />
<br />
What is there reason to removing instance power leveling with your 110 on another account, instance power leveling has been around since the start of the game, I've used it every expansion, its only now with the longer leveling(yeah, its longer for the average person) &amp; boosts that its been removed, its nickel and diming.<br />

<br />
Dungeons with a 110 was never worth it, it always reduced your XP gain by too much. Was only worth it if you were RAFing with someone else and a 110 was running you through a dungeon. Where is your &quot;always&quot; coming from?<br />
<br />
It was much faster as I did it myself with a nightbourne within the first couple of days.<br />
<br />
By always, meaning I've done instance power leveling with myself for the last few expansions.<br />

I have been asking for a leveling system like this for many years. I have no desire to buy a boost. How am I being nickel and dimed? I'm not nieve, I understand the financial motivation for doing this. On one part, they are cashing in on the player base that only cares about 110 and the quickest possible way to get there. On the other hand, they're keeping players that actually like the *slightly*slower leveling system who care more about the journey than the destination. <br />
<br />
And yeah, slightly. It's absolutely not as bad as most of you are making this out to be. But lots of players are now spoiled, that's where this reaction is coming from. You want results in as little time as humanly possible with the least effort exerted. <br />
<br />
To me, that contradicts an RPG or a good MMORPG. But feel free to voice your opinions. Me and my level 17 warrior are having the best time ever.<br />
<br />
So you basically agree with blizzard removing instance power leveling with 110, removing option from 1 player base to make a little bit more money?</div></div><hr />

I'm an altoholic and I only have 8 max level toons, for example.<br />
<br />
Being the in the minority in terms of the number of alts I've made and being in the minority/majority in sentiment regarding this new leveling system are two completely unrelated things. Someone on their first alt could have my view on this new leveling system. I should have kept to myself what number alt I was on. It really has little bearing on how bad this new system is. To be fair, I enjoy that I can queue for any vanilla dungeon from 15-60 and so on. I thought I'd say something nice. I wouldn't have played this game since vanilla pretty frequently if I didn't find enough things positive about it for which to play/stay subbed. That list of reasons is dwindling though. I presume you don't care what I think or about my threats to leave the game, which is perfectly fine. I just want to put it out there, maybe Blizzard cares. I assume they have a few eyes watching what people think on websites like this one. All i want is the old leveling speed back. I'm used to it, I enjoyed it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You lot bitching about leveling now, how about try leveling when you had no heirlooms to speed up your leveling or anything like that, and one of the only ways to go faster back then was the rested XP bonus.. <br />
<br />
No idea why you lot even play MMO's if you hate the leveling process so much, as it is part in parcel of any and all MMO's..<br />
<br />
Rolf.. because what was diferrent in vanilla from retail was just the leveling pace...<br />
<br />
Besides, current wow players and MMO-C community never wanted vanilla servers... those who cry for leveling now is those who were attacking everyone dared to ask for vanilla, either in MMO-C or the official forums...</div></div><hr />

Would have been the first time maybe and you failed at that.<br />
<br />
People complaining about the current leveling are most likely not the same that want Vanilla back. Most people that want Vanilla back aren't even playing the abomination WoW has become.<br />
And even when some of those people complain that want Vanilla servers, it's nothing illogical. Those are two different games. The leveling in Vanilla was part of the game while in Legion it's all about getting to 110 asap, go for the endless gear proc grind and go raid because there is no content worth playing besides raiding.</div></div><hr />

Slightly more incentive to go there now. Some of them is still horrible xp per hour due to length and difficulty. <br />
<br />
Does feel stupid that leveling dungeons are harder than mythic dungeons.<br />
<br />
It took me 40 hours in the new system, but I was far, far from optimizing. That 40 hours includes time spent AFK (I just checked my /played), not picking the &quot;quick&quot; zones, going Cataclysm instead of Pandaria, only running like 2 dungeons the whole time, etc. I could have gone significantly faster had I put my mind to it.</div></div><hr />

It isn't. You don't need 40 alts to make the questing experience tedious. You only need 2, presuming you even read them on the first go-through. Most quests in WoW have the depth of a Twitter post - at best. I mean, after you've killed 15 Gnolls and 15 Murlocs and 15 Defias and 15 Elementals and 15 Cultists and collected 20 Wolf Spleens and 20 Bear Brains and 20 Corpse Flowers...are the Miscellaneous Reasons really relevant anymore?<br />
<br />
Does painting the wall a different color make watching it dry more enjoyable for you?<br />
<br />
Anything that slows players down makes this Allied Race &quot;content&quot; (read: redoing old content) last longer. While you're dragging another sorry soul through the same questlines in Stranglethorn, you're not noticing/complaining that you have nothing to do while you wait for the expansion. <br />
<br />
The way other people choose to level their characters does not affect you in any way, shape, or form.</div></div><hr />

Thats what heirlooms are for. You self-entitled people have been given enough. You were probably happier when you weren't such a demanding child and instead an appreciative child.<br />
<br />
And honestly, if you cant absorb yourself into the fantasy of a fantasy game; why play it? Collecting gnoll guts is as captivating the 20th time as it is the 1st time if you are actually engaged in the activity. If you dont like the activity; dont do it. The gameplay isn't for you. <br />
<br />
Being an altoholic is no joke, you have to dedicate yourself to the experience. Stick to what you find fun.</div></div><hr />

This seems like such a narrow minded response.<br />
<br />
Heirlooms have been nerfed. And while they still provide a boost, I liked them they way they were because they allowed me to plow through the parts of this game that I've already completed multiple times, and honestly no longer enjoy (I did, at one point). Although I won't speak for everyone, I think you're going to be hard pressed to find anyone else in this game that will agree with your gnoll guts example, or at the very least, I'd be willing to bet you're in the vast minority. <br />
<br />
You're also generalizing way too much here. I want to get to the parts I do enjoy. People's reasons for playing a game are their own. Who are you to say what we should enjoy or why we should play a game. I honestly don't care about the recent changes with the exception of the heirloom nerfs. Increase the xp so that people like you can get immersed and enjoy that aspect of the game. But then ALSO leave the heirlooms in their previous state for those of us that don't.<br />
<br />
The biggest thing to keep in mind here is I wouldn't be saying this if it hadn't already been in the game for 5+ years. I don't mind changes to old systems, I'm still just struggling to see why they felt they needed to revert back to a system that people complained about when it was last relevant.</div></div><hr />
