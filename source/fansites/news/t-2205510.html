The chance to loot Portal-Stones that can be used to call down powerful Lieutenants has been doubled.<br />

Players can now vendor excess Sentinax beacons that they don't wish to hold on to.<br />

You seem to have missed the part where they brought down Malefic grasp damage and buffed base damage so that Haunt IS viable in comparison.<br />

There`s a really good feedback how affliction nerfs should happen and i totally agree with the guy. Don't nerf us with 30% blank...just take a look and maybe follow the feedback from PTR.<br />
<br />
In Nighthold we had a lot of bossfights with adds so we could keep wrath of consumption up 100% in ToS wont be that case , also each add that die granted us a soul , same ... no more in ToS<br />
So why not nerf Wrath of consumption to less stacks or less damage bonus + lets say 10% MG nerf ?<br />
<br />
Or at least make Haunt with a 5-10 sec cd , in current state i would rather prefer go destro than play with Haunt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shit like this is the reason I quit this game. Shadow priests are good for one patcth and you nerf them into the ground making them mediocre at best. You turn around and make affliction a BETTER VERSION of shadow priest in every way and then you don't even nerf them as they sit in the top 10 on nearly every fight in nighthold holding all 10 slots on multiple fights.<br />
<br />
Last time I did the math after looking at the top 100 affliction and shadow priest logs for every single fight, on average affliction was 160k dps ahead of shadow AT MINIMUM, and on some fights 500k+ ahead of it.</div></div><hr />

This.<br />
<br />
After the recent buffs to other classes shadow priests will be bottom dps. No AoE, bad single target, no moving and casting, crappy new traits. <br />
<br />
And what do shadow have to look forward to in the next Tier, shadowfiend set bonusm you couldn't make it up.<br />

I was looking for one at the last mage tower and couldn't find anything, it definitely sounds like the type of easy census MMO-Champ is capable of though. From an analyst perspective, I think you'd just have to cross reference characters that have two achievements:<br />
<br />
(my account is not permitted to post automatic links on MMO due to being a low activity account, I apologize)<br />
<br />
<br />
A) Reached 110 {max statistic} - wowhead.com/achievement=10671/level-110<br />
B) A Challenging Look {min statistic} - wowhead.com/achievement=11611/a-challenging-look<br />
<br />
(B) / (A) = Eligible % of Completion<br />
Repeat/Filter by Class and graph<br />
<br />
How this data is gathered as a collective database is beyond me however.</div></div><hr />

Priests are hybrid classes that can Heal or DPS. <br />
Warlocks are a pure DPS class.<br />
<br />
You can't really compare SPriest to Lock. Pure damage classes should always come out above hybrid classes. By how much? Now you can argue that point. :)</div></div><hr />

You can because theres no longer &quot;hybrid dps class penalty&quot;. Its just thing from the past that was discarded long time ago by devs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That argument does not fly these days. I'd be all for having specific roles for each class but honestly people would be so angry at a change like that. For example you have a couple superior single targets classes, but they're bad at AE, then you have a couple of really good AE classes. Let's go one step further, then you have a couple of classes that focus on crowd control - yeah this means that only these few classes will even have stuns, roots, silences and things like that. I'd be all for a game like that, ie &quot;old&quot; school rather than &quot;everyone should be on the top&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah so we've had a lot of feedback of this spec, players have told us they want another output for soulshards rather than just unstable affliction. Sooooooo yeah here's a 15% damage increase to every spell. oh yeah turns out you liked the drain soul and agony talents a bit too much so we are nerfing them to force you to pick haunt. Because who wants choices anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agree,<br />
<br />
Why challenge mode is for classes 910+ ilvl.... The better way would be to scale it to the boss level or to the character level. I tried x times to do my challenge and my dps dont allow me to do that with gear ~900. Every video depicts players with lvl ~915+ and they do it with ease. 10ilvl its abount 150-250k dps (for me) its not small.. ;/</div></div><hr />
