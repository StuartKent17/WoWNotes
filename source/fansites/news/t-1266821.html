I look forward to never fistweaving again unless its a gimmick fight or only doing so in fights where there is nothing to heal (but why even bring the healer then...) and one last thank you for making these gradually fantastic changes with only 1.5 weeks to patch, plenty of time to get ready and have alternate healers ready to play.<br />

They have to stand still and you can cause a Frost lock.<br />
<br />
Arcane and Affliction are high on many fights in 5.1, but they shouldn't be in 5.2. <br />
<br />
Summation: Blizzard gives the big middle finger to mages that do heroic PvE content.<br />
<br />
They've already ruined fire (though, due to incoming arcane nerfs may once again come out ahead) &amp; are in the process of ruining arcane in the next patch, and frost (while still net positive in buffs thus far) may not be much better off considering how weak it is in PvE atm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Jesus christ, when are you people going to learn what a skin is? A skin is the TEXTURE, ie. the colour and surface appearance of the 'skin' of the mount. The MODEL is what it looks like - the shape of it. <br />
<br />
So they put a different MODEL on the Protodrake skeleton. Not a skin.<br />
<br />
Seriously, every time a mount comes out with a totally different model, but reuses the same skeleton as a previous mount, the comments section here, and even more so on Youtube, seems to get filled with cries of &quot;omg reskin&quot;. <br />
<br />
Really, it's not difficult people.</div></div><hr />

Dear Wonderpoop,<br />
<br />
Reading should help you, do some research even. Don't base all your opinion on one sentence you read. If you are truly interested in why they change things or why you don't see certain items, you should maybe try to read more on why. Instead of asking mindless questions.<br />
<br />

This mount is just subpar, especially for a Glory achievement. Obviously, ptr is ptr, and I do hope it will be updated more than it's current state. It's just not a good model. Sitting on the ground it looks pretty good, but what really stood out to me is the wings. There is something seriously wrong with the wings, in flight especially.</div></div><hr />

And less obvious question dodging from GC. &quot;You can still lock Frost out with an interrupt&quot; on a class that seems to have roots out the ying-yang, right?</div></div><hr />

Seriously Blizzard, how many times are you gonna reuse the animation?<br />
<br />
I know, right.<br />
<br />
I get so tired of how whatever made us on this planet reused a lot of the walking animations for four legged animals. Also, with most of the fish in the ocean. they all use almost the same swim animations. What is up with that? Birds? Messing with our minds with all the same flapping of the wings stuff..<br />
<br />
We all know Blizzard are Gods and should be able to fathom animations not possible to this world, stuff that would look down right insane and not possible.</div></div><hr />

you whine at our damage being buffed but it makes up for our shit survivability, so what you want dk's to be is a low damage low survivability class so u can one shot us and feel pro</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok here be something, you try and make a unique animation that in no way copies something else and does not look stupid but looks realistic then see how you go.<br />
<br />
When you can do what I outlined above, then and only then can you criticize Blizz for reusing animations. I think you will find it is not as easy as you think it seems to be.</div></div><hr />

Why? We saw fire changes on PTR were ruining fire mages and we weren't even remotely wrong when they hit live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They've already ruined fire (though, due to incoming arcane nerfs may once again come out ahead) &amp; are in the process of ruining arcane in the next patch, and frost (while still net positive in buffs thus far) may not be much better off considering how weak it is in PvE atm.<br />
<br />
Alternative summation: Mages aren't the &quot;buffed to oblivion, 1 button class&quot; any more. Now it's DK's</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omanley</div><div class="date">2013-02-23, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wonder why everyone's bitching about that skyscreamer...<br />
1) since the introduction of raid meta achievements, mounts would always fit with the theme of the coresponding patch:<br />
-ulduar: protodrake<br />
-icecrown: frost wyrm<br />
-4.0 (overall elemental theme): stone drake<br />
-firelands: fire hawk<br />
-dragonsoul (alex and twillight drakesplays a big role): alextrasza lookalike twillight drake<br />
-5.0 (everything's about the china/pandaren): chinese dragon mount/cloud serpent<br />
-5.1 (jurassic parc/lost civilisation theme): flying dinosaur with savage look and primal armor<br />
<br />
soooo where did blizz exactly break with tradition? they just (like always) used the same model as mobs from the same patch already had<br />
<br />
2) Wether it is ugly or not, depends entirely upon perception and point of view.<br />
<br />
As a feral troll, this looks awesome. It kinda reminds me of a lord of the rings' nazgul mount, so it outa look good with an forsaken/death knight too.<br />
Ugly can apply to simply not matching a certain persons' taste<br />
OR it can apply to it having a savage, dangerous, wild look (which I think is something cool)<br />
I have no problem having a mount looking so scary it looks like an old goods creation and straight out of a madmans worst nightmares<br />
<br />
3) If you dont like it/it doesn't match with your transmog/taste, dont fly it. There's bound to be some mounts you like that you already have or can easily aquire by now.<br />
Blizz has created many beautiful mounts by now, creating an &quot;ugly one&quot; every now and then should be excused, I think.<br />
<br />
4) Why not re-use a skeleton, if it perfectly matches the model/animal? I think fire hawks looked weird with the proto-drake model, but it fits to the t for the pterodactyl.<br />
<br />
5) What else would've made sense for this patch to have as a flying mount?</div></div><hr />
