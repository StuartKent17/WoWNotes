Patch 4.1/4.2 - Winged Lion Mount?<br />
I spent a couple of days debating if I should post this model or not since it seems to be an early beta of the model and I'll assume that at this point my readers are smart enough to understand that the things they see can be a work in progress, so there you go! <br />
<br />
One of the latest beta build of Patch 4.1 on PTRs added a new mount model, the Winged Lion Mount! We don't have any information on this mount for the moment, and as I said it looks like a very early version of the model but ... IT'S A LION WITH WINGS! <br />
<br />

Patch 4.1 PTR Notes Update - March 15<br />
The Patch 4.1 PTR Notes (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/160430/patch-41-public-test-realm-notes-march-15) have been updated once again with a couple of class changes and more raiding nerfs. <br />
Classes: General<br />
<br />
Several persistent ground effects now display different visuals for hostile and friendly players. The following spells have the same visual effects for friendly players, but new alternate visuals for hostile players: Ring of Frost, Consecration, Desecration, Wild Mushroom, Flare, Ice Trap, Power Word: Barrier, Smoke Bomb, and Hand of Gul'dan. As a general rule, the alternate effects have a red tint or hue indicating they are created by an enemy player.<br />

Restoration<br />
<br />
Efflorescence has been redesigned. It creates a healing zone at the feet of a Swiftmend target, but this healing zone now restores health equal to 4/8/12% of the amount healed by Swiftmend to the three most injured targets within 8 yards, every 1 second for 7 seconds. This periodic effect now also benefits from spell haste, but the individual ticks cannot be critical effects. In addition, Living Seed is no longer a prerequisite talent for Efflorescence.<br />

Botting in WoW<br />
This comment by Bashiok follows a giant banwave of people botting Archaeology and PvP earlier this week. That's why you shouldn't cheat if you want to keep your WoW account and that's why pointing to any exploit or cheat on our forums will get you banned, hard. <br />
We’re in the process of stepping up our detection and tracking to log and action players that are botting, or habitually AFKing in the Battlegrounds. We’ll be taking aggressive action and removing earned items, Honor Points, and ultimately suspending or even banning accounts of those that are found to be botting or habitually AFKing. It’s a sophisticated level of monitoring we’re undertaking. No one actively playing in the Battlegrounds normally should be concerned that they’ll be actioned. <br />

Heroic Leap<br />
Perhaps I should elaborate further. Heroic Leap should work on flat surfaces, and in a great many places, actually. We've had players telling us that it fails constantly, but without providing more specific information regarding where and how; hence the requests for more reports. There are very specific situations where we have purposefully stopped it from functioning to help prevent exploitation, which I've covered in more detail below.<br />
<br />
Plus it causes tons of exploit issues, due to the elevation of the leap.<br />
Exploitation was indeed a concern, and some of the Heroic Leap failures you’ve seen might be because of the restrictions we put in place to prevent exploitation. If you’re in an area where flying is restricted (like a Battleground) and your leap would cause you to gain more than about 4 yards of altitude, then the spell should fail -- though the cooldown shouldn’t be wasted. It should otherwise generally work on flat terrain and succeed much more often outdoors.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t an ideal solution, but we added this limitation because players were able to use the targeted jump to exploit terrain to reach inaccessible areas or even leave the map. This wasn’t a knee-jerk reaction either; we received literally hundreds of documented cases where warriors could exploit the ability. The short term alternatives, such as disabling it in Battlegrounds completely, felt worse. Ultimately, we want to remove the height restriction in Battlegrounds and other restricted areas when we have a more robust technical solution.

It's just stupid and shouldn't be put into the game, keep to the main story which is a freaking dragon, so give us that, and not some stupid looking thing with some armor on it and doesn't work properly -.- <br />
Dumbasses -.- I'm sorry, but seriously<br />
<br />
Theres loads of dragons already in the game. (:</div></div><hr />

Colossus Smash now ignores 50% of a hostile player's armor (PvP), but continues to ignore 100% of a non-player character's armor (PvE).<br />
<br />
OMG, they actually listened to the 'different effects in PvP/PvE' thing!<br />
<br />
Kind of, however it's still the same effect, it's just reduced, for example, stuns, polymorph etc.<br />
And by different effects I think it means like, in PvE Mortal Strike would cause the Warrior to turn into a demigod who can shoot lightning from his eyes and in PvP Mortal Strike hits for X and reduces healing by 10%.</div></div><hr />

Yes, but then what would the point of Heroic Leap be? Why not just give Intercept back.<br />
What could work is if you have a person targeted, Heroic Leap will leap to that target, otherwise you have the targeting reticule with the current effects.</div></div><hr />

Buff to frost shield &lt;3<br />
10k shield not worth 4k mana, 1 talent point and a gcd. Its more a second frost nova then a shield. Now you can call it a barrier. Remenber other shields. Absorve 5k arcane/fire/frost damage at lvl 85 is stupid. <br />

Why are you complaining about new content being added. Having a lion mount, which is incomplete and you've no clue what it looks like, does not preclude people from having any other kind of mount in the world. If your dream is to own a pink lemur mount, why not go to the official forums and beg for one? Until then, you can ride your awesome flying lion (which is not a wyvern).</div></div><hr />

haha there there Boubouille /pat, some people just don't have the brains required to...do anything, except right silly things on forums, it will get better soon, maybe....<br />
<br />
OT OMG A FRAKKIN WINGED LION!!! if they make this an Alliance only mount I will actually murder everyone. thought it will probably be from either the shop, or possibly something Uldum related (didn't they mention an Uldum raid at some point? or was that just me dreaming?...man an Uldum raid would be badass.....) so that's good. <br />
As for the class changes... Hmm I see that they've started having abilities work differently in PvP and PvE, any chance of having that work for the new 20sec WoG cd as well ;)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MysticalOS</div><div class="date">2011-03-16, 02:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">my favorite is this<br />
<br />
&quot;Several persistent ground effects now display different visuals for hostile and friendly players. The following spells have the same visual effects for friendly players, but new alternate visuals for hostile players: Ring of Frost, Consecration, Desecration, Wild Mushroom, Flare, Ice Trap, Power Word: Barrier, Smoke Bomb, and Hand of Gul'dan. As a general rule, the alternate effects have a red tint or hue indicating they are created by an enemy player.&quot;<br />
<br />
they can do that, but they can't for life of them make boss spell animations visible in a cluster of player aoe. &quot;there is a defile there? oh sorry i didn't see it under that giant frost trap&quot; replace defile with dark sludge, etc its same story every boss fight. Turn textures off on this fight, on this fight, off this fight. it's almost tiring that sometimes you just forget til you pull boss then find yourself trying to do it in combat. i recently added a mod based fix on maloriak just for this purpose, it'll turn them off in dark phase then back on rest of fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes I know.<br />
<br />
But the thing is, its not as lion-y as the Alliance would make lions. <br />
<br />
Look at the level 25 guild mount. That is the Alliance-type lion. The wyverns look remotely like lions yes, but in essence. <br />
And that mount looks very un-Horde is what I mean.</div></div><hr />

On another note.. More buffs to mages. Well, that was it for PVP for me then. Having myself nerfed with collosus smash as well, I guess I can add Druids and Paladins to the list of classes I can NEVER touch as well...<br />
Btw, who is it in Blizzard that allways feels like mages need a buff?<br />
C'mon Ghostcrawler, wake up!! Bring out the nerf bat, and nerf'em TO THE GROUND!! Cause this is just getting silly! I can't even TOUCH a mage in PVP.. :S</div></div><hr />

<br />
When there is a bug that literally makes it unable to test content because some troll-ass Moonkin runs into Orgrimmar/SW or joins your 5-man and procs Owlkin Frenzy, it crosses the line from being an acceptable bug on the PTR to an inadvertent tool placed by Blizzard to give griefers and trolls a venue to piss people off.</div></div><hr />

We’re in the process of stepping up our detection and tracking to log and action players that are botting, or habitually AFKing in the Battlegrounds. We’ll be taking aggressive action and removing earned items, Honor Points, and ultimately suspending or even banning accounts of those that are found to be botting or habitually AFKing. It’s a sophisticated level of monitoring we’re undertaking. No one actively playing in the Battlegrounds normally should be concerned that they’ll be actioned. ]]<br />

Because this is the last PTR patch before it goes live. If the bug is causing the game to crash, that doesn't sound like it's something that you can just change a 1 to a 0. It'll probably take a bit before they can fix it.<br />
<br />
As for the mount, I kind of hope it is a reward for Guild Lev 50 like someone suggested, simply so Horde can get winged scorpions. :D</div></div><hr />

I doubt it, based on the fact that Invincible was Arthas' personal mount, and it dropped off him, Like the Phoenix mount off KT, or possibly the Windstrider off KT 2.0. I'm betting that this expansion's invincible/phoenix, will be a drop off Deathwing, or whatever chest he leaves if we don't end up killing him, and will be a drake in his image, like the onyxia mount is of her.</div></div><hr />

After that horrendous Q&amp;A, does anyone else feel this is a &quot;we would do it but we really cba for it&quot; reply? Besides, it'ss not like Blink has been adressed. I've revived my mage and in Cata content I've found Blink to bug about 1/4th of the time (I actually am counting on it failing now. I get &quot;stuck&quot; behind random pieces of ground that look perfectly Blinkfine to me). Then there's portal issues for warlocks, which they've never cared to fix either on elevators, making it unusable on for example certain terrain in Cho'gall or during Nefarion (and also in Nagrand Arena), much like Blink refused to work on the Rotface encounter. Let's not mention the issues of Charge, Heroic Leap and Feral Charge on Al'Akir, shall we? In Blizzard's defense, they did fix warlock pets despawning during transition from 2 to 3, but the Inferno and Doomguard summons can still not be used, for much the same reason Charge is not working.<br />
<br />
It's not gamebreaking as such, it is, however, highly frustrating and feels so incredibly clumsy and stupid and there's never a straight answer or policy to fix any of this.</div></div><hr />

never had any problems at all in pve encounter. Sure, u cant jump uphill so what, . Even mages blink is buggy as shit in some ways... heroic leap actually works better than charge or intercept.<br />

Mages are OP aswell, and they shouldn't get buffed every patch neither, but warriors are really worse. I see CRAP warriors sitting at at least 2.2k.<br />
<br />
It just annoys me that players can never take the nerfs they get, and just keeps on whining about them, when they clearly need them.</div></div><hr />

Jeeez, try to play a warlock in 2s at the moment, before talking about being a dead class :)<br />
<br />
And you're complaining about 2s...You mean the bracket that Blizzard essentially said wasn't valid when they made rating in 2s not matter at all? The bracket that only exists anymore as a vehicle for easy conquest points? Your argument is just as sad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warlocks and other classes are still not that viable in 3s. Most players want a shadowpriest in their comp instead. And some people are still going for achievements, and not just easy conquest points.</div></div><hr />

Maybe, but were they also removed from the PTR build, that's the important question. Normally, when spells change in a build it is posted on the frontpage, but this time I either missed it, someone forgot them or they weren't changed.</div></div><hr />

It may or may not have wings. Incidentally, what Blizzard has thus far called a wyvern *is* very similar to a manticore. A wyvern is traditionally a variety of dragon (one that usually has combined forelimbs/wings, as opposed to separate arms and wings, which, to be fair, we do see in the Blizz &quot;wyvern&quot;).<br />
<br />
That said, even with longstanding literary traditions behind such creatures, fictional fauna are open to some degree of creative interpretation. After all, Blizzard has reinvented a number of other fantasy conventions with the Warcraft universe, and that is one of the reasons the series is unique.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Manticoras = Body of lion, human face, spikes on it's back and a scorpion tail.<br />
<br />
Wyvern (on WoW) = Very much like Manticoras, you can actually see a hint of a human face on the Wyverns, the difference is that it has bat wings and no spikes.<br />
<br />
This lion however, is actually a form of Sphynx, Whom could be shown as having Human torsos, wings and a lion body, but could also have goat heads, or could simply be winged lions, which seems to be the case here.<br />
<br />
Also, that's doesn't seem to be a scorpion stinger on the tip of it's tail, because you know... lions have a tuff of hair on the tip of their tail, in case you guys hadn't noticed *rolls eyes*<br />
Of course, it's still unfinished, but it doesn't very much look like a scorpion stinger, the poison chamber would have to be more round and bulkier, and the sting more curved.<br />
<br />
So in short; It's not a Wyvern nor a Manticore, you'd have to be blind to think that I'm sorry.<br />

<br />
a wyvern is closer to a mianticore than this. theyre prolly usuing a wyvern body to get lion with wings, slapped some better wings on, and the alliance guild mount head on it. work in progress, but cant wait to see the finished product.<br />

don't manticores have fluffy tails made of needles filled with instant death poison they can launch at people? (much like nettles, minus the launching of course, it's a nettle, not a triffid)<br />
they also have three rows of teeth and can speak<br />
<br />
and wyverns in mythology BTW are basically proto drakes :P (for you people who were curious as to what non-WoW wyverns would look like)<br />
<br />
now I want blizz to make mythological manticores a horde land mount and longer legged proto drakes as flying ones :( (although that may be due to me playing too much monster hunter and wishing I could ride a kut-Ku around... WTB pink and yellow proto drake :( )<br />

Ramkahen already has the camel mounts, so I don't see them getting the lion mount to sell at exalted. None of the new dungeons in 4.1 looks to fit the style to drop such a mount. It doesn't quite look Alliance-ish so I don't see it being an Alliance gryphon remodel.<br />
<br />
That leads me to think that it is:<br />
1. Uldum taxi mount<br />
2. TCG mount<br />
3. Blizzard store mount<br />
<br />
I don't see them going through the trouble for Uldum taxis, though.<br />

It could very well be a mount that won't see the light of day until 4.2 and will be available somehow in 4.2.</div></div><hr />

also, as to the &quot;horde gets goblins, we want another mount QQQQQQ&quot; the amount of mounts are equal at the moment, plus, worgen get running wild. or are you going to also QQ about paladins getting 3 extra mounts, locks getting 2, and DK's getting a flying one as well?</div></div><hr />
