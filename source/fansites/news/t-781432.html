prevent movement=root<br />

Interesting Rogue buffs. I'm a bit concerned about: Mastery: Main Gauche. I'll have to look more carefully at the math, but on the face of it Combat Rogues have a hard cap of 42 mastery. I mean, I don't really need more than 100% chance to proc an extra attack do I? With other Masteries additional points give you an extra x% damage to such and such or an extra x% healing to such and such. Ours gives an extra % chance of it happening. Once I hit 100%, it's gonna happen. I'm done.<br />

Edit to add: OK, dug up some more info on Mastery Rating vs Mastery Score. It would take a phenomenal amount of Mastery to hard cap. Makes a lot more sense now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After doing some more extensive math assuming you get all CS crits and no TV crits you end up with at most a 2.48 weapon damage % per second loss which can be made up with the seal mastery and exorcism buffs. Not to mention they might actually want a small dps nerf to pallies. <br />
<br />
If TV crits, then the least dps loss you could cause (having 3 CS crits) is a 1.23 Weapon Damage % per second loss. If there are no crusader strike crits and a TV crit, then its a 1.86 weapon damage % per second gain. This means, if TV doesn't crit, assuming 5000 weapon damage (I'm guessing what our weapon damage is going to be for Cata), then your dps, at most decreases by 124, if TV does crit, it decreases by at most 62 dps, and could gain 93 dps. Honestly, I can live with that to allow for our mastery to be of some use, and for the huge buff to exorcism.<br />
<br />
This system of equations assumes that you have an ideal system with a perfect 3.0 CS cooldown and are using them every time they are able to be used, with TV getting used right on the GCD, meaning it the Weapon damage % loss divided by 10.5s.</div></div><hr />

Now it's just &quot;Oh hey I got a random hot from the druid. YAY FOR HAVING A GOOD HEALER SO I CAN BE FREE TO BE BAD!&quot;<br />
From what I can tell, Holy Word: Sanctuary is no longer the aura of white light that heals people who stand in it either.<br />
Holy paladins at least keep their aoe healing aura thing, so it'll benefit you to stand closer to your holy paladins.<br />

<br />
That is absolute bullshit, blood elves want from having what could be considered one of the better racials (for PVP mostly) to the absolute worse in one patch. I mean compare to gnome, they have the same resistance, a 15+ to a profession (compared to BE 10+), an extra PVP trinket (comparable to short range silence) PLUS 2 others (extra mana and dagger expertise)</div></div><hr />

In context with &quot;New Beta build available soon&quot; it would be pretty obvious to a reasonable person that what was meant was &quot;There will soon be a new beta build, which now has the new login screen.&quot; I know, I know, context is hard. It's really unfair of people to make us think for even even the smallest fraction of a second before we open our mouths.

<br />
I'm guessing this is to keep it in line with MS, yay! /sarcasm<br />
<br />
I also like how they want you to pay energy for Feral charge in order to get a fifty percent discount on your ravage once x) If I read the changes correctly that is (I hope that is just a misinterperatation caused by a phrase that makes no sense: &quot;Reduces the cost of Ravage by 100%, down from 50%&quot;). It's kind of funny. Since they then should hopefully have fixed the issue where Ravage actually does less damage than it is supposed to out of stealth. I'm not on beta, but on live that was pretty frustrating. I know the damage should be higher on that skill when using it combined with the Stampede talent. Nerfing the only actually neat additions the spec got for this expansion is risky, but Idk if it was needed or not. Time will tell. The only reason to atually pick Stampede at all was one free ravage. A ravage at 50% the cost while good, may not be worth the time spent to get the proc in PvE or to waste a cooldown on simply getting said proc beforehand in PvP. I definetly hope I'm putting to much into the change on Stampede and that there was no change on the cat version at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pally AoE heals were nerfed, and single-target subsequently buffed so we're encouraged to use those more. Also, live != beta.<br />
<br />
I like the holy pally buffs, especially the mastery buff. It seems like it was very underwhelming initially, and increasing the base absorb, scaling, and duration makes it a bit better. If it lets the stronger shield roll, I'd be fine with that.<br />
<br />
Prot pally talent changes are...interesting. If Wrath of the Lightbringer is indeed 2 ranks for 50%/100% additional damage to Crusader Strike, that would be a much needed buff for it as prot, since Hammer of the Righteous hits harder for both single- and multi-target tanking on live. It would push it towards Blizzard's intended roles of both abilities. The change to Divine Plea through Shield of the Templar is a much-welcome change, since it's hard for prot pallies to ramp up Holy Power to begin with. Also welcome is making the 15s CD on Avenger's Shield baseline, since everyone took the talent anyways.<br />
<br />
Shield of the Righteous change, however, is a big nerf to the ability. Going from 120% attack power to 3656 damage is HUGE (assuming these are lvl 85 values), considering I have 3.2k AP on live already. This means it won't scale from Vengeance nearly as well as it used to. Were we doing that well with single-target threat on beta to warrant the change? The base numbers scale the same as the old values depending on HP (1x/3x/6x).</div></div><hr />

I'm going to assume you don't play a paladin on Beta. We're probably hands down the worst healers, we need a lot of changes. I'm sad no changes to Light of Dawn have been made, as it's a talent that needs a lot of overhaul. (A Base % and maybe a range boost) to make it any good, and possibly a shorter cooldown.<br />
<br />
Also, your &quot;10 people to take a holy paladin down&quot; claim is pretty dumb. Two people can take a holy paladin down if they actually interrupt. It's the same thing with all healers ATM, if they know how to play you wont be able to take them down easily.</div></div><hr />

I am guessing you do not pvp much. If you did you would either not make these claims..or you'd be lying. <br />

I don't know about on beta, but I do know that holy pallies are almost unkillable in 1-60 pvp atm and above that it takes a mass effort.<br />
<br />
I actually do PvP as a holy paladin. I hit 2600 in Season 8.<br />
<br />
Have you seen druids, or priests on Live? It doesn't even matter what is happening on live. I don't think people understand how big of an overhaul is happening from WotLK-&gt;Cata. It's not something small, as currently LIVE doesn't represent Cataclysm at all. Damage and healing scales are all wonky. Most of these changes are to satisfy the cry babies who want everything to go their way.<br />
<br />
Druids are just as strong as Paladins right now in PvP. Same with priests, I'd say Shamans are a little underwhelming admittedly, but it's only about a month until Cataclysm hits until this game hits the proper scaling. When Cataclysm comes out, THAT's the time to start worrying about balance and changes, right now asking for something to be changed is exactly redundant.<br />
<br />
Also, on Beta, paladins are extremely underwhelming compared to what we are on live. Keep in mind, Flash of Light takes about 6% of your mana away in Cataclysm, same with other heals. It's going to be rough playing a healer in Cataclysm, so we'll see when it comes out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ret ones ain't really dumb, they are just changing numbers around which is fine for the sake of balance. What I don't understand is why TV is now more powerful than HoW. It's what made Zealotry and Avenging Wrath different, they did not had the same rotation. With Zealotry, you priorized TV, and with AW, you priorized HoW. Now you'll only priorize TV, all the friggin' time, which is retarded. More complicated is more fun ok Blizzard? For christ's sake...<br />
<br />
And they removed Prot's only proc. Wasn't Blizzard initial intention with Prot paladins to make our rotation less boring and static and to give empty GDCs? Wow, way to fail. We still have no empty GDCs, and the only little tiny thing which could make us react and grant a tiny bit more TPS, a Grand Crusader proc which would have us use another Avenger's Shield instead of an Holy Wrath, is gone.<br />
<br />
I do have to say though the changes to Shield of the Righteous are an excellent idea. That thing scaled way too much with Vengeance. We will stop seeing those retarted crit numbers in raids from now on (which was fun for a time btw, hahah, but retarted in the long run :P).<br />
<br />

<br />
Shield of the Righteous change, however, is a big nerf to the ability. Going from 120% attack power to 3656 damage is HUGE (assuming these are lvl 85 values), considering I have 3.2k AP on live already. This means it won't scale from Vengeance nearly as well as it used to. Were we doing that well with single-target threat on beta to warrant the change? The base numbers scale the same as the old values depending on HP (1x/3x/6x).<br />
<br />
This is a welcome change IMO. That thing used to hit for retarded numbers (60k + crits with full Vengeance stacks anyone?). And it's not like we needed more TPS anyway, we already generate WAY too much on live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From reading elsewhere, it may be just a tooltip change that reflects the actual values instead of 20%/60%/120% AP. I guess we'll know more when it hits the beta servers.<br />

I admit before Magic resistance was very good but blood elves only have 3 racials compared to some races which have up to five. They better give blood elves something else to make up for that major nerf.<br />
<br />
That is absolute bullshit, blood elves want from having what could be considered one of the better racials (for PVP mostly) to the absolute worse in one patch. I mean compare to gnome, they have the same resistance, a 15+ to a profession (compared to BE 10+), an extra PVP trinket (comparable to short range silence) PLUS 2 others (extra mana and dagger expertise)<br />
<br />
To make up for it I'm sure Blizzard will give you staff specialization so you have some expertise with staffs :) So you have the same number of racials. This change was really needed because before Blood Elves got all the other races resistence racials as one. So you could count that as 3 or 4 other racials. Compare it to Humans we got a 3min PvP trinket which is completely useless for PvP, you still have an awsome interrupt, silence. Plus Enchanting is more profitable profession than Engineering.</div></div><hr />

Buffs:<br />
-Exorcism scaling increased by 15% and base dmg increased by 15%<br />
-TV does 10% more weapon damage<br />

Why:<br />
-Popping Wings and using HoW was one of the only ways to kill healers. <br />
-Exorcism can only be used during Art of War procs (RNG)<br />
-For every TV we use Crusader Strike 3 times - We use Crusader Strike a lot more than TV. <br />

Sadly they are not taking the right aproch on fixing the issues... And the issues are the mecanics and cd of the AOE holy paladin spells.<br />
Two AOE heals - both with long cd - both with more limited range than any other healing spells - both based on position - and BOTH with single flat heal and no mecanics for number of players it hits.<br />
<br />
THis is the issue that BLizzard will NEVER be able to balance. Or how on earth are you gonna balance something that heals 25 ppl in 25 man but does 5 times less in 5 man instances ? You can not. Light of dawn now heals for 2-4k (depending on glypth) every 20- 30 sec. Its useless in 5 mans and will continue to be so while with so narrow healing output. Still - its the 31 point talent. And totally and utterly useless. I have been playing my pala both in beta and live without going into the last two tiers of the holy spec and I feel absolutly no diffrence in my abilites as a healer. After all.. the last 11 points in Holy talent tree have very little to do with the ablity for a paladin to heal. SPecially in 5 and 10 man content of the game.. <br />
<br />
Thank god you dont have to spec into last tier of the spec. Its enough to just spend 31 point in it. But.. what does it tell us about the Paladin holy talent tree and the 2 last tiers ? Absolutly useless from a healing perspective. Totally and utterly.<br />
<br />
What is needed now is BALANCE. BLizzard is not solving anything atm by leaving the aoe healing spells for palas either totally op - or totally useless with 30 sec cd... Real fix is needed and its needed very soon. We could be in for some tradig issues in the next few months if this goes on like this. Cause there is absolutly no way to balance this horror of healing mecanic atm.<br />
<br />
If you dont belive me... 1 aoe healing spell does 75% of the healing in 25 man raid.... It has 30 sec cd... The range diminishing return will not solve anything cause ppl will just stack up more to get the huge numbers. In 10 man the same spell has much less use (remember same areas so diminishing return reduces the SAME numbers there).<br />
<br />
But hey... these are the same ppl that gave us Ret paladin in WOTLK .. and Death knight with tank and dmg in all talent trees. The thing is... most ppl could have told them it would be impossible to balance from 2v2 PVP up to 25 man PVE raiding. THey did not listen. And sadly they are not gonna listen now by the looks of things. But all have seen long long time ago its totally impossible to balance these AOE healing effects.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What holy palas have been pointing out is that it has NOTHING to do with numbers. It has to do with how the AOE healing mecanics are applied. These spells are not right atm and BLizzard is refusing to admit the obvious. And now.. instead of actually giving paladin a relyable AOE healing spells for all content ingame... they just buff the old single target spells and leave the AOE spells unchange on 30 sec cd with 3k healing with narrow cone (LOD - also in 5 mans !) and nerf radiance without cause even only up for 30 sec - it heals 75% of the entire healing of holy palas in 25 mans. <br />
<br />
Its not the numbers that are wrong. - unless you blatantly accept the obvious that a healing spell that does 3k per person every 30 sec in 5 mans does 5 times less than the same spell you use in 25 man. Its same mana cost... same cd... Everyone can see the issues. Thats why I dont even spec into that talent for my 5 man runs. And its the last talent of the entire tree. Two last tiers of Holy pala trees are just not worth spending points on.</div></div><hr />

You are exaggerating things a bit, I think. Remember that Blizzard stated that they wanted us to be VIABLE for raid healing, not necessarily be awesome at it and replace a Druid or Priest. Light of Dawn and Holy Radiance are great spells for AoE damage, but we also have a better Holy Shock and WoG to make single-target healing less painful and more efficient. Most of the AoE damage is very predictable, so using LoD and HR shouldn't be a problem if you can anticipate when to use it, otherwise our heals will suffice at topping someone off.<br />
<br />
From watching the videos, tank damage is still significant, but definitely less spiky. There's no need to spam tanks as much as we have been doing in WOTLK. We can take a bit of time from healing the tank to touch up the raid a bit if we needed to. And since ToR helps our HP generation, more instant WoG is nice for that random raid member that decides to stand in the fire and take more damage.<br />
<br />
The last two tiers aren't terribly useless as far as holy goes. Tower of Radiance is great for HP generation, which less us use WoG more. Light of Dawn, while terribly situational, is still very useful. Blessed Life, although buffed considerably, is still a PvP talent, although some spells like Marrowgar's Bonestorm do seem to proc it (from reading on EJ).<br />
<br />
But I guess I can't really say anything, since I'm not in the beta and all.</div></div><hr />

We're probably hands down the worst healers, we need a lot of changes. I'm sad no changes to Light of Dawn have been made, as it's a talent that needs a lot of overhaul. (A Base % and maybe a range boost) to make it any good, and possibly a shorter cooldown.<br />
<br />
Also, your &quot;10 people to take a holy paladin down&quot; claim is pretty dumb. Two people can take a holy paladin down if they actually interrupt. It's the same thing with all healers ATM, if they know how to play you wont be able to take them down easily.<br />
<br />
that would be all fine and dandy if the paladin needed to cast anything anymore which they don't. they can just holy shock and word of glory to full health no problem anytime they get remotely low. i'm on top of my kicks as a rogue but holy pallies are ridiculous right now. they really do take a mass of people to take down.</div></div><hr />

But you are on live and you can right now go into 5 mans and test if the last talent point in holy tree is worth taking or not. I have repeatedly tried to make it work in random 5 mans for the last week but there is just no way you can. It heals 1 -2 ppl and for about 2-3k each... (I use 20 sec glypth and it also does 20% less healing...) Since I stopped using it I have gone many runs and got alot of prase for my healing in randoms.</div></div><hr />

As for the beta changes, they are BETA CHANGES. Like many have said, that's what beta is for. To change, fix and mess around with things until they are just right. We all get used to the changes in the long run anyways so why complain so much? Once Cata actually releases (and you can experience the stuff first hand) if you still hate it that much then stop playing, problem solved.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think everyone knows that Light of Dawn is nothing more than the graphic effects atm. The acutally value of the spell is very limited.<br />
<br />
In terms of killing holy pala ... he can use holy shock every 6 sec and that holy shock gives 1 holy power that does around 3k healing used with WoG. 2 ppl can very easily take him down in those 6 sec. But ofc... now we will see holy palas dominate PVP cause they are buffing the single heals based on the fact that the AOE heals dont work at all as 30 sec cd and flat heal number. <br />
<br />
So... Lets fix AOE healing spells and then lets balance PVP shall we?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">duraz0rz</div><div class="date">2010-10-27, 10:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But you are on live and you can right now go into 5 mans and test if the last talent point in holy tree is worth taking or not. I have repeatedly tried to make it work in random 5 mans for the last week but there is just no way you can. It heals 1 -2 ppl and for about 2-3k each... (I use 20 sec glypth and it also does 20% less healing...) Since I stopped using it I have gone many runs and got alot of prase for my healing in randoms.<br />
<br />
Situational heal is situational. Light of Dawn is something I would use if everyone in a 5 man has a lot of damage taken to prop a few of them up a bit, then bring up the other 2-3 it didn't hit first.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't recommend using the glyph because it reduces the healing by a lot, even though it's on a lesser CD. Better off bringing people up with single target heals and saving it for a situation where everyone's hurt and you can hit a lot of people with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
By situatnional you hopefully count in the fact that most range classes do not have to think about where they stand to get healied by cone heal... SO they dont bother ... And why on earth should they ? <br />
<br />
As I said... its not worth using. The glypth should ofc be changed right away and remove the healing penalty but then .. when it becomes half usefull in 5 mans.. it becomes OP in 25 man.<br />
<br />
So.. See my point about balancing issues. We will come to it again and again for the next 2-3 months and either the class is op or its crap. That is the last thing Holy palas needed right now. THey needed a relyable healing tool to help with AOE healing. Neither of these 2 spells are balanced for diffrent number of players so it CAN NOT be relyable at all. That just a fact that everyone can see right now. ANd it will become more and more obviuos when we see holy paladins struggle in 10 man raids while still beein op in 25 man raids. Simulare tactics are used in 10 and 25 man encounters. SO... The penatly in terms of holy paladin healin spells is pretty much based on number of ppl while smart heals on fixed numbers will work many times better in 10 mans for other healing classes.</div></div><hr />

I wish they kept the style from Vanilla and BC with the portals, and just emphasize the background/portal textures with the current theme of the expansion.<br />

WotLK's wasn't so bad (ok, minus the shriek/roar).. I liked how it portrayed Icecrown Citadel (technically your last goal for the expansion) and with the snow, etc, gave it a very à la WotLK feeling.<br />
<br />
Cataclysm. I don't know... It just shows Stormwind (horde = we don't care)<br />
with Deathwing just sitting there.. What kind of dragon just sits there, looks around... Probably talking in trade while he's at it.<br />

Proper T-rex roar still makes my spine tingle.<br />
<br />
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq4Y7ztznKc#t=2m12s<br />
<br />
That's what I'd prefer, anyway, and I'm not talking about the roar, I'm talking about his guttural noises, kind of like how when the T-Rex was moving the jeep around curiously.<br />
<br />
I can't take any of you Paladins seriously anymore, I can't take A Paladin seriously anymore, we just failed in AB because of two Belf Paladins, a Ret that took nine people to take down each time and a Holy who didn't die at all, people literally fled after 12 people, almost ALL of our AB team, failed to kill her.<br />
<br />
12 people could not kill a Holy Paladin, if we'd of had ONE Rogue, maybe then, MAYBE.<br />
<br />
So I just can't take you seriously, unless things have changed dramatically in the Beta and Paladins are suddenly this weak Vanilla era joke, they're strong enough, and don't need AoE buffs.<br />
<br />
I really see no hope for Paladins as they are currently, it's obvious Blizz can do it right by Druids, Tanking, Healing, DPS, but things like Exorcism just scream &quot;I'm a Holy who can two shot you!&quot;, maybe if Paladins had their own &quot;forms&quot; they must adhere to in order to gain the benefit of each spec, locking them out of the others, like a Tree can't Mangle or Shred, and a Moonkin can't use certain powerful abilities.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, the bitching just makes me laugh at how ridiculous you guys are, PvP, PvE, Paladins dominate everything, to complain they aren't powerful enough to me is like saying &quot;That nuke wasn't fiery enough, can we put some more explosives in there?&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't rely on Light of Dawn for healing, then. Use your single target heals, combined with Beacon of Light and Protector of the Innocent. You're effectively healing three people at once (Yourself, beacon target, and healing target). During dicey times, let HR go and continue healing low people with single-target heals.<br />
<br />
These spells may be more effective with larger groups, but you're only going to see that on the meters. You're still going to heal relatively the same amount of people for the same amount.<br />
<br />
<br />
SO... The penatly in terms of holy paladin healin spells is pretty much based on number of ppl while smart heals on fixed numbers will work many times better in 10 mans for other healing classes.<br />
<br />
Wait, so CoH, with a 15yd radius limitation around the target, 6 target maximum (glyphed) that heals for about 4-5k per body (Guessing) with a 10s CD <br />
<br />
is worse than <br />
<br />
HR, with no target limit and a 20yd radius that ticks for about 1.9k a sec for 10s with a 30s CD? (AND YOU CAN MOVE AND CAST WHILE IT'S TICKING). I don't see the logic in that.</div></div><hr />

Eh.. I hesitate to point this out, but we've probably killed (rekilled?) more already dead dragons than live ones. There were two in Kara, one in Naxx, literally dozens all over Northrend, 4 in ICC... At this point dead dragons are a specialty for most WoW players.</div></div><hr />

Yea it is a lot of copy and past with some actual parts of her dance. But it was listed as being BASED on the song. Not being the full dance since the video is always changing shots and you can never get a full loop of the dance. Sure like others have stated they could of or should of used Bad Romance but we know Blizz is more focused on raids than dances so we're just stuck with what we have.<br />

<br />
This is overly off topic.<br />
<br />
Bisexual has as much to do with homosexual culture as it does with heterosexual culture. If the gay community are looking for a figurehead, they would look to someone who is strictly gay... not a fence sitter.<br />
<br />
...and by the looks of it, she has sat on many of different fences.</div></div><hr />

You might have missed the point of that website entirely. Not being a negative Nancy might help though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can they nerf ally racials any more? They may as well remove ours or just add them to hordes, I mean why not? The comments at blizzcon made it clear where their favor lies. <br />
<br />
Gnome- 5% increased int, nerfed to 5% increased mana<br />
Human- Every man for himself is essentially gone, now on a 3mins cd. Any PvP'er worth his salt will take the trink on a 2mins cd instead. <br />
+all the ones listed above. <br />
<br />
Where are the nerfs to Blood Fury and berserking. <br />
<br />
Orc= 5expertise no ally has 5 expertise with any weapon as a racial <br />
<br />
Goblem= free bank access anywhere and lowest prices from all vendors AND haste buff which is MUCH better than crit buff<br />
Worgen= free skinning knife, crit buff, lame</div></div><hr />

<br />
Diablo: We don't want PVP to drive our PVE experience. When we balance a skill we do not nerf, we ask ourselves; &quot;How can we make this lesser skill better?<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft: &quot;Hey look this rogue's getting nuked by a priest; let's just nerf priests into oblivion and not care what it does to the PVE system until they whine about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
In my honest opinion, I think arena seasons are just a trick by the devs into getting the PVP nerds to think there's an endgame for arenas and possibly battlegrounds too.</div></div><hr />

It's bad enough with focus that our DPS dropped dramatically and we suck in PvP, but apparently they want to make sure that we aren't viable at all.<br />

The 8% attack power scaling drop will hurt big time.<br />

link the Running Wild animation, which has been implemented in this beta build. I am just glad they did a smooth animation transition between unmounted and mounted instead of the cast bar and instant blink onto the mount.<br />

Yeah... no. You see, Benny Hill is actually funny. Lady GaGa is just some random weird drug-woman who got picked out of the gutter by some guy who had too much money on his hands and made her popular under the people, by making popular I actually mean stomping down everyone's throat day in day out for years after some finally succumb to it and actually believe she's &quot;cool&quot; and a good singer.<br />
<br />
And that brings my rant to an end.</div></div><hr />

Benny Hill has never been funny. Ever. <br />
<br />
Back on topic: I like the dance. Nowt wrong wi' bit o' Gaga. I do now have no clue if I should roll male or female Worgen. It's down to a coin toss now I think.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Collected</div><div class="date">2010-10-28, 07:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think they should have been more clever with the intro screen.<br />
<br />
Rather than it just being default stormwind, they should have two versions... one with stormwind, one with orgrimmar. And based on the faction of the player you were playing when you last logged out, that is the screen you see.<br />
<br />
So if I play an orc, I log off, log back on, Deathwing is in Orgrimmar. If I'm a nightelf hunter, he is in Stormwind.<br />
<br />
Typically most people stick to one faction mainly anyway, so they'll mostly see the screen that fits their faction.. rather than everyone looking at stormwind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Old: Increases the critical effect chance of your Heal spell by 10%, and your Heal refreshes the Duration of your Renew on the target.<br />
New: Increases the critical effect chance of your direct healing spells by 10%, and causes your direct heals to refresh the duration of your Renew on the target.<br />
<br />
Add on top the chance to 30 second cool down (done yonks ago) Chakra Heal is pretty good now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
(I'm sure they meant that the gay players see lady gaga as a beacon of gay light and hope, so to speak. Like a figure head or something. and that having a dance by her in the game its some kind of victory for gay culture or something like that...)<br />
<br />
