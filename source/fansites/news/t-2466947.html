WoW Classic Updates<br />
Not to split hairs here, but I’m far more interested in the decisions that have been made than I am how far along they are in implementing said decisions. I have total confidence in Blizzard to make things happen from a technical perspective. I do have some concerns that the overlords at Acti-Blizz will “encourage” extras to generate revenue at the expense of authenticity.<br />
Those are some of the coolest conversations I think I’ve personally had about the project with the Classic team. As a fanboy I honestly get a little giddy about them. I don’t want to overhype them because not a lot of people are that excited about restoring old maps, or UI elements. Like I said before we look forward to sharing more specific details and even some examples of how the team managed to solve some problems that we think are pretty interesting.<br />
<br />
I totally get the concern, but to comfort the thought that comes with that, this isn’t a normal project. It’s a passion project for you folks that have been diehard Classic fans and have been asking us to provide a real Vanilla server for over 10 years. We know we haven’t won over all of you yet, and some are waiting to see a closer final product, but the team is dedicated to trying to pull it off.

My favourite part was when the Devs were passionate about their game. I am 100% done with WoW now though sadly, and to ensure of that I have converted all my gold to WoW Tokens which were used for capping out my Battle.net balance to €250, as well as deleting my characters.<br />
<br />
That must have been painful. No matter how bad it is or becomes in the future,I will never delete my characters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I deleted my first account, like, the account itself, because I spent way too much time on it.<br />
In many ways it was a stupid decision, and cost me shitloads to buy a new account. And you'd think that ruined the whole point of deleting it in the first place, but having an account I'm not as attached to felt kinda refreshing. I also spen(d/t) much less time on it for that exact reason. <br />
<br />
Ofc had to take screenshots of every bag, character, letter and achievement first though. And then you kinda realise that's all there is to your chars, so it was fine. For me. Since everyone asked.</div></div><hr />

I was 17,5 years old (and yes I had to &quot;lie&quot; about my age for 6 months to get a &quot;guild with 18+ only&quot; when I started in 2005 !<br />
<br />
I still remember my ragequit/switchserver/swich faction/switch class (yes I started from scratch) after my guild didnt want any more warlocks on Onyxia &quot;because mages do better dps&quot; even when I outdpsed them... It was before the &quot;more dots!!&quot; meme of course</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sil</div><div class="date">2019-02-12, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Classic WoW is way overdue. Would've done it a few years ago but not now. Won't live up to the hype any longer. It will be relatively packed at launch but then die off slowly. Vanilla was great but only when you experienced it as a new game. A time where items were only known after a boss was killed, where surprises existed. Everyone will just level up now to get his Dark Edge of Insanity and/or Corrupted Ashrbinger to stand on the mailbox all day. Whooptie fucking doo. <br />
<br />
Fanboys don't like to hear it but this game is in such a hard decline, you'll be lucky to see 1 more expansion before it dies off completely.</div></div><hr />

That's not even an answer to the question, like wtf? The GM is just telling how much he loves Classic WoW (or at least pretends to). Answer the damn question. That's like me asking a car salesman how fast a car can drive and the car salesman answering with &quot;This car is awesome! Look at the color! Look at the tires!&quot;. Shit like this tilts me so hard.<br />
<br />
I know I'll sound negative, but it's answers like this one which usually leads to companies trying to milk you out by pretending to have the same passion for something like you do, while in reality they dodge anything you're saying/asking because they only care about the revenue.<br />
<br />
Every time I have to read something like this, I'm losing more and more hope for WoW Classic.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, that's a long-winded way of saying &quot;we started out WANTING to do an authentic Classic, but money talks, shit happens and out Acti-Blizzard overlords got involved. But hey, shop store with classic isn't that bad right? You still get the Vanilla experience, but you also get to make micro transactions!&quot;</div></div><hr />

I also read it to mean &quot;do it on your own time&quot; sort of thing, just not a good choice of words imo. Not that I care, I won't be playing classic, I've already played it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In this case maybe, but historically it means additional side projects people worked on above and beyond the requirement.<br />
<br />
a lot of the secret stuff (hivemind, etc) are labeled &quot;passion projects&quot; because people work on them outside of what they normally are doing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It’s possible. I interpreted it differently and to mean that the people working on it are just that passionate and wanting to turn it out to be amazing for the people who are waiting for it.<br />
Maybe I’m being optimistic about the topic even though I’m probably not even going to mess with Classic at all.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BenBos</div><div class="date">2019-02-13, 07:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My son and I started playing in Sep 2006. I stood in awe. Runing up and down that road from Stormwind to Goldshire and back again.<br />
<br />
Looking at that dark blue sky at night with shiny stars ...<br />
<br />
Oh I will never forget these first few epic months in WoW.<br />
<br />
My son still plays in rated Arenas at around 2200-2400 ratings in casual play. He has the eye hand coordination of a football player while I am too old to fulfill my earlier healing talents in even basic Raids :)<br />
<br />
In 2012 I quit WoW to play Diablo3 in hardcore mode with the Gold Auction House as the BEST experience I ever had in computer gaming. Grinding mats to craft leveling gear for all those avatars dying in hardcore mode :)<br />
<br />
At the end of 2013 it went down the hill VERY fast. The cry babies won their plea against both AH of Diablo3.<br />
<br />
Rob Pardo left the company. So I went back to board wargaming, my oldest hobby since 40+ years...<br />
<br />
One can only hope to have such a WoW experience again in his life time... but I don’t think the magic will ever happen again.<br />
<br />
Sad really....<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
And one more thing...<br />
<br />
While playing my board wargames I made up my mind. I will no longer visit these forums as these places are the exact same shit that made me quit WoW.<br />
<br />
I will certainly return to Classic WoW and try to be as innocent as I was back in 2006 without visting these pools of hate and crazy people.<br />
<br />
It worked in my other hobby, so it should work in WoW too.<br />
<br />
Just a few more months of care free happiness is all I want :)</div></div><hr />
