The latest build introduced a VERY interesting feature to the game: a built-in PowerAuras (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/powerauras-classic.aspx). If you are unfamiliar with the mod, it is mostly used to watch and warn players when a spell proc is available and the game clearly reached the point where it's fairly hard (or just annoying) to play at high level without a mod like this. <br />
<br />
Blizzard eventually agreed that watching your buff bar isn't really fun and a new icone appears on your character when situational spells such as Art of War are available, see the screenshot below.<br />

Mages - Teleport/Portal Interface<br />
Mages are getting an interface upgrade similar to Shaman's totems for their portals, you can now add a generic &quot;Portal&quot; and &quot;Teleport&quot; spell to your bar and pick a portal after clicking it. <br />
<br />

Darnassus - The Howling Oak<br />
A new sub-zone was added to Darnassus in the latest beta build - The Howling Oak, the area isn't populated yet but it looks like it will be the home of the worgens in Darnassus. <br />

Reforging - Video and Screenshots<br />
For some reasons I still get a lot of questions about reforging, this new feature is fairly simple: You talk to a NPC in capital cities to swap 40% of any of the secondary stats of an item (ratings / Spirit) for another secondary stat. TotalBiscuit released a video of Reforging in the current beta build, if you want to take a look at it.<br />

Cataclysm Digital Download<br />
If StarCraft II is any indicator you'll be able to download the client beforehand, and the the installer will unlock at 10AM pacific time. So, if you want it right at midnight (or a collector's edition), your best bet is probably a pre-order and midnight release at your local brick and mortar. But, this is all assuming things which we haven't release any information about.<br />
<br />
I'd wait for more info... like... a release date. ;) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560496528/word-of-caution-for-pre-ordering-cata/))<br />
<br />
Tol Barad Tunnel System<br />
Those 3 micro dungeons will be closed off during the main battle. Anyone in them will be kicked out. They are there to support daily questing in the zone between battles. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560865999/tol-barad-tunnel-system-question/))<br />
<br />
Throne of the Tides portal on beta<br />
The Throne of the Tides portal inside the instance was set to take you to Dalaran because for a while you couldn't get out of the cavern. In a future beta build, it will take you back to Vashj'ir. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560836338/thone-of-tides-instance-portal-bug/))<br />
<br />
24 Hour Maintenances<br />
The 24 hour maintenances have all been related to large scale hardware upgrades. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560566644/blue-please-not-about-the-loading-freeze/))<br />
<br />
Beta Feedback<br />
This is a beta test, so generalized feedback about how and (vaguely) why healing is not fun -- when we haven't even reached the level cap in the test process -- doesn't give us actionable feedback.<br />
<br />
There are a few things to consider here:<br />
<br />
<br />
Healers don't play in beta quite like they do in Wrath of the Lich King. Yes, the system is designed to be less forgiving so that the heal you choose to cast, or how often you choose to heal your party or top off their health bars, should be a more meaningful decision.<br />
Numbers are still being balanced, bugs are still being worked out with each new build, and we're still iterating upon individual spells and abilities.<br />
The whole group could be approaching a dungeon like they do in Wrath, trying to pull as many packs of mobs as possible to charge through it. This isn't Wrath, nor are players or creatures balanced around Wrath numbers.<br />
As an expansion of my first point, you might be making bad choices.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you'd like to give us constructive feedback we can take with us to the drawing board, give us scenarios. Tell us what rotations you're using, the group make-up, whether you're using CC or AoE, a play-by-play of specific pulls or boss fights, etc. We want to know what the specific cases are where you are being as conservative as possible and still finding it to be a struggle, or even just too frustrating. We can look into that type of data. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560836571/healing-is-not-fun-what-did-you-do/))<br />

New Holy Spell<br />
The new Holy level 10 spell is pretty simple, but it also has a lot of play with Chakra. I am just pointing this out, because many players never noticed the talent that made the old Holy level 10 (Desperate Prayer) into a tool that could heal others.

Also, yeah, the new Portal/Teleport thingie is nice - if only it worked correctly.. :/ Right now Mages have only 2 teleports/portals - Shattrath and Dalaran, all others don't work. Of course that's a bug and won't go live, kinda sucks right now though.</div></div><hr />

You can always find similarities if you just look hard enough. Howling is pretty easy when it's about wolves, it's a tree coz it's in Darnassus, doesn't necessarily make it a Harry Potter thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Portal interface is awesome! I play a Shaman so I know how amazing it is to have a setup like the Totem Bar.<br />
<br />
I am REALLY hoping that Reforging stays the way it is in that YouTube video. Having it be profession specific encourages players to pick professions that make gear (Tailor, Leatherworker, etc) because they can Reforge most of their gear. That will make all the other professions seems worse. Just let everyone Reforge any of their own gear.<br />

This is what I dont get. Why with the digital download cant we play it at midnight? Why does it have to be at 10am?<br />
<br />
I would assume they would be releasing at midnight on a Tuesday, meaning there will be a regularly scheduled server maintenance. 10am would be the earliest time the servers would be back up. This also gives all the brick and mortar buyers to get the game installed before the servers come back up, leveling the playing field between them and the digital downloaders.</div></div><hr />

Customization leads to complication. It takes less than 30 min to learn how to work PowerAuras and get up and running. Then you can start getting into the advanced stuff.</div></div><hr />

What were you expecting? From what I've seen, it's exactly what they said it would be.<br />
<br />
On a related note, The Power Auras change is very cool, one less add-on to clog my memory. The Howling Oak is a very neat looking spot for the Worgen, my favorite hang out city is Darnassus, so this addition is cementing it's place as my favorite.</div></div><hr />

You can always find similarities if you just look hard enough. Howling is pretty easy when it's about wolves, it's a tree coz it's in Darnassus, doesn't necessarily make it a Harry Potter thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
They didn't outright call it the Whomping Willow, though...<br />

It could also be a way to stagger the amount of people logging in, as having everyone log in at the same time might cause the login servers to melt. They said that the hardware, or software, was upgraded in Cataclysm to handle more traffic, but I would guess that a massive surge in traffic over a short period of time might still overwhelm things.</div></div><hr />

Why do people have &quot;donate&quot; popups on the WoWInterface site then? I guess they are making a profit, but they are saying that it's donations and not making it mandatory.<br />
<br />
I just feel bad for the guy that they took his idea. Though I'm hoping that Blizz made all of their own code for it and didn't even look at any of his. It's late and I'm medicated, I can't think of anything other than that. :P</div></div><hr />

The Goblin slums are representative of the entire race regardless of class, but this blizzard it represent who? Night Elves and Worgen Druids.. What about all the other classes, what about you know, the people of Glineas.<br />

I know this is an alliance thing, and Blizzard is contractually required to put in the least amount of effort possible, but is the just beyond worthless.

Donations are different, they are not classed as a &quot;sale of product for profit&quot;.<br />
<br />
If, however, you had to subscribe to a website (like curse or wowinterface) for a monthly fee and/or pay the author DIRECTLY a sum of cash to be able to download the addon... then that would be breaing ToS/EULA.<br />
<br />
And before you say those websites do have subscriptions... they are to use the premium functions of the websites and NOT to get access to the addons.</div></div><hr />

That would be considered a Donation, and Blizzard have every right to donate or not to.<br />

Although... you often find that Addon Authors get &quot;paid&quot; in other ways (for example, getting direct access to Beta without waiting to be randomly selected).</div></div><hr />

My bet is that somewhere in Cataclsysm there will be some kind of homage to the addon creator, much like Aldriana's Gloves of Secrecy etc.<br />

Blizzard eventually agreed that watching your buff bar isn't really fun and a new icone appears on your character when situational spells such as Art of War are available<br />

Cataclysm has too many unnecessary add-ons also, everytime you level, a flash made animation popups in the middle of the screen telling us that we reached level x. Why do we need that?

Dot Timers as bars may not be a must have, but they greatly improve the quality of life for me. And so do ScT and Eavesdrop. Addons are mainly about taste and the way you want the Data to be shown on the screen. The Data itself isn't really changed. ;)</div></div><hr />

Ya know, I tried using an addon similar to that.

I used to use a Wardrobe addon until Blizzard released the Equipment Manager. This works fine and even stores config data on the server so it's there between installations. If this proc alert addon stores config on the server then it will be perfect.<br />

Once I figured out it was a notice for spell procs, I was a bit calmer. The only problem is right now, you get what you see- just one, giant, yellow &quot;wow&quot; symbol in the middle of your screen. I didn't notice any way to change it (position, coloring, opacity), so I hope they put that in- if so, it'll be perfect. Otherwise, right now it's an eyesore and kind of frustrating (covers up my character/whatever I'm fighting).</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's a good chance it will be a mirror graphic of the spell that's getting the proc. There's quite a few spells that have no graphic yet.<br />
<br />
I like this change, it's very nice for stuff like Lava Surge which only has a chance to randomly proc. I never used PowerAuras, but I can definitely see the appeal if it's like this. The portal change, along with Summon Demons, is also very nice.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adrim</div><div class="date">2010-08-20, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reforging, at the moment, seems a bit... lame. Not what I was expecting. :/<br />
<br />
I too was originally expecting to be able to trade X for Y and basically open up the gear choices. But now that I think about it, I much prefer the way Blizzard has actually implemented this.<br />
<br />
BEFORE: You'd have basically ended up seeing people rolling on gear they had ABSOLUTELY no business rolling on. &quot;Yeah I know I'm a holy pally rolling on your tank gear but I'm going to swap the defense for crit, derp.&quot; Also, for most gear there's usually already 2-3 version with the same basic stats and different secondary stats. One with spirit that favors healers, one with hit for people who might be needing more, etc.<br />
<br />
The system they have now, I feel, specifically targets the most frustrating part of gearups: forced regem to make caps. How many times have you gotten a significant upgrade that is missing a major stat compared to your current gear? &quot;Oh yay, a 245 chest but...wait...it doesn't have hit like my 213 chest and so if I use it, CRAP I have to regem all over to make cap&quot; That's expensive and a never-ending chore.<br />
<br />
Now, you go to one vendor, pay, boom. You just made up your missing deficit. Regemming only gets you like 30-40 rating tops (if you are spening more than 2-3 gems on a major stat, you have the wrong gear). 30-40 rating is exactly what this reforging will offer.<br />
<br />
So, yeah, I was bummed initially but given that I don't want to have to deal with the inevitable gear hell that would result from a total free-for-all on stats, and given how many thousands of gold I've had to shell out because I ended up at 4.9% hit or something...I really think this is a good design.</div></div><hr />

It'll be like Starcraft II. If you get the digital copy you download it 1-2 weeks before the release date. At 10am on the release date they start to allow you to unlock the copy you've already downloaded. If you go buy the game on the release date, you could get it at midnight, rush home, install and be playing long before 10 am. Thus if those extra 10-17 hours (depending on your time zone?) matter to you, go buy it at the store.</div></div><hr />

Players shouldn't be forced to download all these addons to be better. Sure, you can do fine without them, but certain addons certainly make you better.</div></div><hr />

My objective is to have everything installed and ready to go the day before if I can. If the downloader will at least let you install the client but not activate your account via b.net until 10 then I'll just have the client installed and then run to the walmart next to my house and grab a key at midnight. I just don't want to come home with a disk, wait 30+ mins to install and then have to wait for patches, etc.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't work that way. You can't use a store key to activate the digital download. You have to pick one or the other.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can play that game without them, no matter how terrible a thought that might be, so you aren't being forced. They are optional. That said I'm glad they're giving healers a way to see the entire raid without dragging out those horrible raid frames.<br />
<br />
The only ones we could really do with being integrated more effectively into the standard UI imo are Recount and Omen. The flashing warning is nice but doesn't really give much info. Recount would be nice so that we finally get definitive damage done, damage per second, etc.</div></div><hr />

But you would think if someone spent all that time making and maintaining addons through all the patches that Blizz would all their money would compensate them for taking the ideas. (Since they have boatloads of money anyway.)<br />
<br />
It somewhat irritates me when people say Blizzard is loaded with cash. Sure you can add up the sales from boxes, and the monthly charges and it looks like a ton of money! Billions of dollars! However, no one takes the time to figure that a large portion of the 11 million users are in the Asian system where they pay a much lower cost than EU and US. Also, no one ever takes the time to think about bandwidth, cooling, server hardware, salaries of developers, managers, helpdesk workers, etc. <br />
<br />
Look up the share prices of Activision (which Blizzard is a part of) they are only at $11 a share, and I guarantee you that wallstreet doesn't give two shits about what a company does if it can make them money. The annual filings from 2009 show that Activision as a whole company had a net income of $113 million. So while the income of a company like Blizzard is huge, the expenditures are also huge and as such they are not as flush with coin as you seem to think.</div></div><hr />

Well, they are loaded with cash...they ended 2009 with 3.3 billion in cash on hand and their board of directors authorized a $1 billion share re-purchase program...and 2010 should be even a better year for them with the release of Starcraft and Cata to name just 2 of their product releases....I don't know about you but I have a lot of trouble feeling any sympathy for them or cutting them any slack.</div></div><hr />

You can just turn it off like the rest of this stuff and be done with it. The only thing they're doing here is baking a really basic version of an existing mod into the game itself thereby giving you the option of not having to download an extra add-on.
