Blood, sweat, and tears stain the Arena floors and Battleground fields—a grim chronicle of the hard-fought battles many of you have survived. Once again, the time has come for the victorious to be heralded, and champions to be rewarded!<br />
<br />
Season 14 is coming to an end as early as two weeks from now. On that day, we’ll begin the process of determining end-of-season reward eligibility, which could take up to two weeks to complete.<br />
<br />
Qualifying players should note the following in order to ensure you receive your just rewards:<br />
<br />
<br />
Please do not transfer your characters to another realm or faction until after Season 14 has ended.<br />
Award distribution for Season 14, including titles and mounts, could take up to two weeks after the season ends, though our goal is to finish in one.<br />
Only players who have a rating of 1,000 or better are considered when calculating rewards.<br />
<br />
<br />
At the end of the season, Conquest Points will be converted into Honor Points, and any Honor above 4,000 will be converted into in-game currency at a rate of 35 silver per point. There are a few other things to keep in mind once the season ends:<br />
<br />
<br />
The Honor Points cap will remain at 4,000.<br />
All Season 14 items will have their costs converted into Honor Points equivalent to their previous Conquest Points cost, with the exception of any items that have a rating requirement.<br />
Season 14 items with rating requirements will no longer be available for purchase.<br />
<br />
<br />
Season 15 Arenas and Rated Battlegrounds will begin approximately one week after the end of Season 14, and all Personal Ratings will be reset at the same time. Also note that Arena and Rated Battleground matches will not be available during the break between seasons. Once Season 15 begins, players will battle for the right to equip Prideful Gladiator gear, the most powerful PvP gear in game to date with an Item Level of 550.<br />
<br />
Lastly, as of the beginning of Season 14, PvP players no longer needed to join or create an Arena team to compete. You can find more information about this earlier change in our Patch 5.4 Arena Update (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/10333782) blog.<br />

Entirely possible! I suspect we may get a beta announcement in the next two weeks as well. A 4 month beta seems completely plausible.<br />

By the way, for those that are not knowledgable in the timeline or basis of the game lore. Imperials are going to be a Collector's Ed. only, but; during the era of time ESO takes place, you are at war with not only the three factions, but also Molag Bal and the undead army aided by THE IMPERIALS. The game literally takes place around a thousand years BEFORE Skyrim. Just as we all know as well, the games before Skyrim, Arena-Daggerfall-Morrowind-Oblivion, take place in the third era of Tamriel timeline. Skyrim is the fourth era, ESO will be the second era.</div></div><hr />

Even though I'd like to know a little more about the game I actually think this is way better than posting every freakin new implementation they made like Blizzard is doing. With Blizz games you know the whole god damn game before you even played it once. <br />
<br />
Saying the game is bad has absolutely no value since not everyone has the same taste.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also beta tested the last weekend stress test they did, and I hardly got through the tutorial bored to death. Gameplay isn't fun, especially for an MMO, UI is as bad as any other ES games (very bad for a MMO to have a shitty UI). Yes, the fact that the game is still under NDA should scare you... At least, it didn't feel laggy or bugged, it just was boring. Got invited again to the next test session, don't think I will bother.</div></div><hr />

One of the Blizzard employees stated a couple weeks ago that they want PvP seasons to last anywhere from 20 to 23 weeks.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xrafice</div><div class="date">2014-02-05, 03:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The game's a blast, judging from my latest beta experience. Of course there are issues. And, like every other game in the past few years, there will likely be issues at launch, as well. But me, personally, I can't wait, as each beta has been DRASTICALLY improved over the last. They're having at least one more beta and so long as the improvements continue as exponentially as they have, the end result will be epic.</div></div><hr />

They are not going to hold up releasing the next expansion because of not being able to run an optimal length pvp season. If the expac is ready they will shorten the season, if the expac is delayed they will lengthen it. A pvp season is entirely flexible and would not be cause to delay an entire expac.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can give a bit more clarification other than, &quot;It's bad&quot;, I suppose. Having played the beta quite a bit, I can simply say it's just .. horribly generic. There's absolutely nothing that grabs me. It feels like Guild Wars 2 but a bit more polished, in a way. Having played any number of MMOs, this just doesn't have the &quot;it&quot; factor that the MMO Prophecies have told us is coming. It just feels like another Rift/SWTOR/GW2/FFXIV. Honestly, I would wait until WildStar. Or, hell, .. EverQuest Next. At least both of them are TRYING something new-ish to spark life into the MMO genre.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most complaints about the test weekends start as &quot;boring&quot; &quot;on rails&quot; etc then either change to &quot;too hard&quot; or &quot;not enough direction&quot; by the end. Play it for more than 10 minutes before bashing it (from a still undecided punter).</div></div><hr />

<br />
@ mercutiouk<br />
<br />
You are right: the game might be good, but nobody that complains how moneyhungry blizzard is can really go to ESO: Compared to them Blizzard are angels: because not a single of their services is necessary; convenient yes, but not necessary. Heck even the Level 90 service is compared to ESO nothing: in ESO you can buy your &quot;heirloom&quot; even before the game started and are faster at leveling than normal. OK, blizzard will sell level 90s too; but to be fair: the vast majority is 90 now and you will not be faster at leveling when WoD hits. Heck even the gear is on a lower ilvl than Timless-Isle-Gear.<br />
<br />
If it was a P2Play-Game that is free afterwards it is understandable. But it is a suscription-based-game and after all this news: No thank you!</div></div><hr />

Never played that race, and never will - there's plenty of other choices out there.<br />
<br />

Why are you whiteknighting them? It's an entire race. Cosmetic or not, would you like it if they put any race in WoW behind a paywall? It's going to set a precedent if people actually support this, and it will only be the start. I see no reason for people to defend it.</div></div><hr />

Now, about TESO, I was a sure byer and also pre-order byer. There was also a good chance for me to buy the collectors...But then they announced the collectors edition and a whole race locked behind it...now my problem is not the extra 20-30 bucks but their attitude..imagine to buy wow and not being able to play Humans unless you buy the collectors. This is a bad attitude for a game that charge the box and a monthly sub. Now I am not even read the tamriel foundry, their fansite for information. The only chance I may buy it is to lift this restriction and also apologize for this bad movemt so people don't expect them to do the same on an expansion or something.<br />
<br />
Also for people who think wow will release on June 24 or July e.t.c. There is no possibility that the game will release on summer...Release on summr when people are on vacations is very bad business. If they cannot make it until Late April - early May then 99% is going for September/Octomber.</div></div><hr />

Whiteknighting? I wasn't aware ESO was a little damsel in distress where I'm hoping to get laid with.<br />
<br />
As for the paywall race in wow? You mean how they put mounts behind those paywalls of yours as well? Same thing. Neither of them I care about, as it's not something I would spend money on, and I won't blame people for doing so, as it's cosmetic.<br />
<br />
As for strawmanning my post, I wasn't defending anything. I only stated my opinion regarding Imperials, and made a general statement pointing out some people's hypocrisy.</div></div><hr />

From what I've played I think it's a game worth buying, but this idiotic need to equivocate all MMOs as the next either the next WOW or they're failures,... it's getting old. WOW got people to try MMOs who never had before when the genre was new. <br />
The genre isn't new anymore, and gamers don't need to try MMOs anymore that exist in the millions to pool from. It was a perfect storm of high quality and untapped audience potential. <br />
The audience no longer is around, gamers are all on the net and gaming has become more mainstream, information and social networking and comments sections create meme like congnitive viruses manifesting as bias and I whistled for a cab and when i came near, the license plate said fresh and had a dice in the mirror. <br />
<br />
I think it's a solid game and will have a large audience, one of the more successful and stable MMOs in the end aside from WOW.</div></div><hr />

I see no reason to criminalize it either. The whole of the world is built in this concept. Pay, get something. Pay more, get more. Can't handle it? Time to wake up. <br />

I'd be thrilled if humanity gave socialism a shot, but since you cannot change the way the world works, why getting obsessed over little things like PC games? People need to get their priorities sorted out.</div></div><hr />

and this is how F2P games work...they are a true capitalism system where you have the rich people and the poor experience the game(world) in a different way. However, the subscription model is known for the opposite...you pay a monthly fee and you get 100% of the game. No rich and poor, no distinction between the players. Matt Firor (ESO designer) also said that too<br />
<br />
&quot;just having one small monthly fee for 100% access to the game fits the IP and the game much better than a system where you have to pay for features and access as you play.&quot; - Matt Firor <br />
<br />
&quot;We don't want the player to worry about which parts of the game to pay for - with our system, they get it all.&quot; - Matt Firor <br />
<br />
&quot;We feel that putting pay gates between the player and content at any point in game ruins that feelign of freedom.&quot; - Matt Firor<br />
<br />
now I live capitalism every moment in my real life and I don't want the same for my games too. MMORPGs create virtual worlds where people get &quot;lost&quot; inside...it does not need to be like real life and thats why many of us we prefer the sub model.</div></div><hr />

There definatly are rich and poor in subscription models aswell. Truly poor people neither have a system to play, nor can they afford the game and the monthly fee. If you have money for an MMO, you are not poor. <br />
<br />
I also don't see where he contradicts his statements.<br />
<br />
You can access all of the game you bought. <br />
<br />
You do get every part of the game. You don't have to pay to access area x or zone y. If you bought the IE, you can get there as an imperial. I think there is a big difference inbetween -where- you can go, or -how- you get there. It is not as if parts of the game are blocked out to 'regular' subscribers. It's just the way and looks that differ. If Imperials had their own starting zone, or exclusive habitat, or something, if they had more or better racials, I would agree. If they had crafting styles, or items, which only they could use, I'd agree. But in this case I think many people overreact. You have 9 races to pick from, of which most are (in my opinion) much more exciting then the Imperials. If they had put Dunmer, Altmer and Nords, or a whole faction, behinde a paygate, I would agree. But they didn't.<br />
<br />
You can access every corner of Tamriel (available), as any class, any faction, that you'd like. You don't get to do it as an imperial. <br />
<br />
Also, stressing the rpg is really unnecessary. Only because you want to pretend that you are somewhere else doesn't change the fact that you, your life and your game are part of a capitalistic world. <br />
<br />
I'd also like to point out that I am in no way happy about how the world works.</div></div><hr />

I didn't say that they shouldn't. They probably couldn't. It's not my place to tell people what they can or cannot do (exept in health issues, job wise), But in my opinion, if you have the money for an mmo, you cannot be considered poor.</div></div><hr />

If you think Blizz microtransactions and businessmodel is bad, I need to warn you about ESO. They've locked an entire race to only those that buy Collectors Edition.<br />
And you can only play as any race in any alliance if you preorder. That's why I decided to boycott the game. I am not buying a game that forces me to preorder and get the collector's edition to get every feature. Fuck that.</div></div><hr />

You're VERY naive if you think Wildstar or EQ will be anything else than another Rift/SWTOR/GW2/FFXIV/TESO. Especially Wildstar is actively being killed by the hype going on about it. NDA was lifted a bit and players like Kungen streamd Wildstar on twitch, and the large majority of feedback was extremely negative. Wildstar is going to fail just like TESO.</div></div><hr />

ESO will be more successful than Wildstar, the game is being killed by the hype it is getting &amp; It really sad because it was a good game until they changed all the fun stuff. Just people are saying it something its not like like every other game before it. Alot of my friends who were interested in Wildstar before have lost interest &amp; decided they will try out WoD &amp; ESO instead.<br />

Wildstar is a good game, but its just another MMO. It's not this juggernaut people claim it is. Beta is the best way to see the game for what it truly is &amp; what it will be. A niche MMO with a small dedicated community that is casual &amp; non-competitive like other MMOs have, it will never reach the competitiveness WoW has.</div></div><hr />

Talk about misinformation by a potential Blizzard shill. What a blatant lie. Wildstar word of mouth has been amazing. I have been following it all just about every message board and media source. Did you see the customization video? You can customize your own mounts. Wildstar is a theme-park with many, mini sandbox elements.</div></div><hr />

I didn't say WIldstar is going to be a bad game in any way. I'm sure some people will have their fun with it. By saying &quot;it's just another Rift/Tera/Aion/Star wars, etc&quot; I'm just saying it will have similar success like those games(that is, very little). Not many people will play it and hardly anyone will talk about it 1 month after release</div></div><hr />

I do think its a dickish move that Curse gets 500k keys and basicly tells u to buy curse premium or u wont get in Beta. Thats just selling beta keys. Did you inform the TESO makers that you were gonna make 500k x 3,- from it?</div></div><hr />

Not going to support a developer like that, so no im not going to buy the game even. Even before all of this i had 0 interest in the game since its been going downhill from Oblivion (dumbed down to child level) not what got me into Morrowind, no sir.</div></div><hr />

I have zero interest in this - they're modding it after DAoC, but barely upgraded the graphics. In game vids look a bit like Rift, but more chaotic. The races are unimaginative and the lore is meh. Granted, I only played Daggerfall (and played the crap out of that buggy buggy game) - and had no interest in anything else by Bethesda - so I'm biased, but come on, you showcase your game on Youtube, you should at least make it look good. I agree with the SWTOR comments - Bioware kept it under wraps for a long time... this does not bode well. In my opinion.<br />
<br />
People really need to stop using the old DAOC engine. Warhammer sucked with it, Rift sucked with it, and Swotr sucked with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you think Blizz microtransactions and businessmodel is bad, I need to warn you about ESO. They've locked an entire race to only those that buy Collectors Edition.<br />

Sadly I am expecting less of Wildstar ....</div></div><hr />

Had my hopes up, downloaded the monsterous game with it's 50GB installed size, and got met with the beta weekend bullshit.<br />
<br />
And to this, we of course have the issue with getting a special race for the collectors edition. I was planning on buying it to at least get lost in the leveling for a bit, but this will for sure be the first time I actually boycott a game.</div></div><hr />

Except the nods to former games, exploration etc. :)<br />
<br />
What sucks with ESO is Zenimax' and Bethesda's business practice. They are even worse than Blizz at draconean moneygrabs of late, and the beta structure is really tiresome as well - don't get me wrong, it's their game and they obviously have their way to test it, but there is no encouragement to do so with this structure. All this stuff just makes it so that to actually give this game a chance it'd have to be the best game in the universe to be worth the investment, and it doesn't sound like it.<br />
<br />
I'm genuinely sad at seeing the potential squandered. I hope they can turn it around.</div></div><hr />

I believe Curse to be on EST timezone wich means it won't be another 5 hours and 39 mins before it opens for the non premium members.<br />
Don't hold me on it entirely though.</div></div><hr />

I can't point to you the quote, but I'm pretty sure they said there were NOT going to be new models, just recolored.</div></div><hr />

Yeah it's a real shame for people with caps. There is absolutely no reason to download a beta for just a weekend if you have a cap. Thankfully I don't, so I downloaded it overnight while I was sleeping.</div></div><hr />

Actually if you want to blame someone blame curse.com for not stating it was for a weekend test only that's if they didn't because I know for a fact that if they (TESO) invite you themselves by email they clearly state that its for a WEEKEND test only. I've been invited twice now by email and it does say that.</div></div><hr />
