I'm so glad i didn't go all the way to the Usa for something so mediocre. A terrible mobile game, a remake of a 2003 game, a silly hearthstone expansion and the only positive thing a cool new hero for Overwatch.</div></div><hr />

The only save they had were to show their future plans for Diablo, but they came with a mobile game. I don't blame people for feeling disappointed, no matter whether you like mobile games or not. There were barely any exciting news, possibly some information about Classic WoW.<br />
<br />
Oh well, let's hope Blizzcon 2019 can be any better.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gadzooks</div><div class="date">2018-11-04, 03:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Putting Diablo aside, it wasn't a completely horrible event. Overwatch and Hearthstone got some good stuff, but it was completely ignored in the Diablo drama. <br />
<br />
I feel that people only rate Blizzcon on &quot;OMG NEW STUFFS&quot;, but that's just part of it - there are big tournaments going on, and all of the games have fans there to geek out on, try demos, go to parties, meet other people, check out the cosplay people, etc. <br />
<br />
Sure, it's fun to be there for big reveals, but I'd bet most of the people who did go had fun.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kolvarg</div><div class="date">2018-11-04, 03:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing about Blizzcon as that people always go in hyped and with high hopes for ground breaking announcements, and forget that more oftan than not there aren't any that big.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I do it as much as the next guy. But we need to remind ourselves Blizzcon is not just that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Either way, I thought it was pretty decent actually. Nothing huge (as we should expect tbh), but pretty cool.<br />
<br />
I love W3 being remastered, and WoW Classic is looking great, as well as the news on it. Above all, I really liked the WoW panels. With all the tension that we've been seeing in the WoW community it was great to see them aknowledge BfA issues, and announcing promissing stuff for 8.2. More than all, I loved how all WoW panels were presented. Great communication and with plenty of humor; loved it!<br />
<br />
I really like also how voice actors, streamers and other content creators are more and more being included in it, and that at least most of the presenters I noticed seem to actually know, like and care about the games.<br />
<br />
Wost part of this years Blizzcon imo was how the video-on-demand worked this year. Last couple years it was up a few minutes or at most couple hours after the stream ended, but this year it's taking essentially a day for many panels. That's not cool, and really makes me re-consider buying the virtual ticket next year.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">korijenkins</div><div class="date">2018-11-04, 03:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And so ends possibly the worst Blizzcon of them all.<br />
<br />
I'm not kidding either. They didn't have much to show this year. No new games. No big expansions. Nothing. Just skins and patches, with mobile excrement nobody wanted and a remastered game. <br />
<br />
And sure, the remastered game can be considered &quot;new,&quot; but the framework was already there, the voice acting and data was already there. All they did was make new models.</div></div><hr />

Yeah it'll be fun to play again, but do we really need to go back all the time? Why not move forward..<br />
<br />
All the time and effort spend on those projects I'd much rather they put in making new shit we havn't seen or experienced before. <br />
<br />
Still, beats a god damn mobile game thats for sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
keep the price of the virtual ticket, i don't care. but offer meaningful rewards in your games. a mount is obligatory in WoW and come on, it really doesn't cost you that much.<br />
<br />
what blizzard should really do are some new things to blow our minds. yes, starcraft 2 only works in the framework they laid himself by splitting the original game to three different campaigns. yet it should be possible to add something really new despite small content like commanders. hearthstone expansions are fine, hots additions too. WoW has a cycle but maybe you could have a rougly ~2 years for big addons and maybe every year something other big for blizzcon.<br />
<br />
what they REALLY shouldn't do are mobile games like diablo immoral. that kills all the magic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nothing except Overwatch is going forward. Biggest announcements are W3 (2002), Classic (2004), Diablo mobile which takes place before D3.<br />
<br />
Blizzard completely lost all their narrative, they have no clue how to make their stories going forward without looking like a total mess as BfA is.<br />
<br />
But let's be honest guys, we all knew this Blizzcon would be shitty as soon as the Opening Ceremony was delayed... to talk about Destiny. After what Joe Allen completely showed that he didn't have any expectation either.<br />
<br />
Shame on you Blizzard.<br />

<br />

They are not listed, which means you cannot find them through normal research, the only way to see them is through the link. They've done that to &quot;hide&quot; the like/dislike ratio.</div></div><hr />

Ermergerd a female hero for Overwatch and HoTS ermergerd SJW FEMINISM... oh wait... female heroes in Blizzard games is nothing new.... I know I can not wait to play Ashe for sure.<br />
<br />
And rainbow pins... I did not even notice that, I guess I was too busy looking at the content.... But yea... let's not critisize the content but on how Blizz is being &quot;SJW&quot; Heck I bet that because of your mouth foaming raging you didn't even hear Code.org is in essence not feminist but to try and get more &quot;minority&quot; representatation in the coding business. *shrug* I do not see anything bad about that but eh.<br />
<br />
These forums sometimes... :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Anyway back to the content of Blizzcon... the Diablo mobile game just... well... sigh. I do understand there is a huge business to be had on the mobile games market, but using Blizzcon as the only &quot;big&quot; announcement for Diablo only to announce a mobile game is just painful. So far I know no one who is a fan of Diablo wanting a mobile version of the game. With the disaster and later damage control of Diablo III in mind this is a huge disappointment for the Diablo community for sure. <br />
<br />
WoW... well... eh... I think I am starting to become burned out with that game anyway. The Warcraft III remaster even though I will buy it, it's not something which is a big huzzah factor for me.<br />
<br />
In short this Blizzcon has been a major disappointment for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They shit on alliance again with a joke when there is currently a perceived bias atm against them for the shit mounts, the warfront crap, etc... <br />
<br />
And they also try tossing out a mobile game without at least announcing a new expansion for D3. Do they not know their fans either want a new expansion or D4? At least Bethesda was smart enough to release a quick teaser for Elder Scrolls 6 when they told everyone they were going to make The Elder Scrolls: Blades. Hell ES6 probably wont be out for 5+ years and yet they chose to officially announce it since they knew people would be pissed about not getting a &quot;real game&quot; anytime soon.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Code.org® is a nonprofit dedicated to expanding access to computer science in schools and increasing participation by women and underrepresented minorities&quot;<br />
<br />
Well done<br />
<br />
Ah yes and with all your points, let's pretend Azshara was never a STRONG lore character, and let's pretend Jaina Proudmore never was a strong lore character but this &quot;suddenly&quot; happened.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile the leader of most allied races.. let's see which ones have a female leader: Void Elves and Nightborne. Moira Thaurissan, which has been a part of the main Dwarven lore for a loooong time now not to mention a regentess, which means her power might be next to zero soon, I guess you forgot that too. And eventually the Dwarves are still ruled by the Hammer Council (Council of hammers?) if I recall correctly so, again. And like I said; the WoW lore does not interest me anymore right now as it is an absolute trainwreck. <br />
<br />
Now let's see Heroes of The Storm: more male heroes than female.<br />
<br />
OVerwatch: More male heroes than female... although it's almost 50/50<br />
<br />
And hilariously you keep calling me triggered... but erm... You might want to read what you write, also in replies to other people who also replied to your ENTIRE post.. but you seem to ignore the fact that people react to both points in your post and just keep going off and completely seem to foam mouth at &quot;ERMERGERD U R ALL SJW NPC FEMINISTS&quot;<br />
<br />
But hey keep the people like you and You people up against people who are not even remotely close to what you accuse them of being... But then again, looking at your post history it's not surprising.</div></div><hr />

After such a disappointing Blizzcon one of your main takeaways from it is how awful the company is because they tried to raise money for a feminist association, wore rainbow colored pins, and added female heroes to games??<br />
<br />
For some, feminism means anti-male. Modern feminism is not about equality. It's about women's rights. Those two are not the same thing.<br />
People who have been wronged by women (e.g. children and custody issues, lied about rape, etc.) will likely take this as a personal attack to them because this can be viewed as &quot;picking sides&quot;. So for some a life ruining thing is more important than their favorite game franchise betraying them.<br />

And remember, if you do disagree with either sides; you will be put in the side they disagree mostly with because they are just angry at the world because the world is not exactly as they want it to be. and or agrees with their far-fetched opinion. ;)<br />
<br />
Heck I think this is the first year I am actually considering to stop playing all Blizzard games aside from Overwatch because of Blizzcon this year to be fair. The entire show has just been a major disappointment and well Diablo... well let's not talk about that because there is nothing good to be said there.<br />
<br />
As I said before the Warcraft III reveal gave me a bit of a &quot;wooo&quot; feeling but left mostly underwhelmed by the rest of the announcements and panels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sometimes it's not just opinion -- it's experience. But life is nuanced and complicated. For instance, while there are fewer women in programming (and such) there are more women college graduates. These are complex problems that simple solutions won't fix.<br />
Women have been hurt by men. Men have been hurt by women. I could tell you my perceptions (of which I'm quite passionate) but they aren't relevant here.<br />
Honestly I was doing to donate to code.org until, in this thread, I found they discriminate in favor of minorities and women. Also the pet isn't as cool as alcohol pupper from yonder year.<br />
<br />
Perhaps I should change my Amazon donation as well. I'll worry about that later (I'll probably forget).<br />
<br />
I'm considering WC3.<br />
<br />
I, too, have been considering stopping Blizzard games but I've also considered pulling back my gaming entirely. WoW doesn't appeal to me like it used to. Flying is in 8.2 (edit: Yes, flying IS that big of a deal to me). I didn't realize how I felt so strongly about some things being on the GCD but it bothers me more than I realized.<br />
<br />
Maybe I should be more productive in life and less on games. Maybe less on MMO-C and social chit chatty.<br />
<br />
I'm uncertain. I have some programming projects I've been dragging my feet on. Perhaps I need to shrug off this laziness haze and get off my ass. Maybe them tanking Diablo and 8.1 WoW being meh is my sign.</div></div><hr />

Yup, and as Blizzard themselves put it, it's mainly women, so yeah. Well done indeed.<br />

<br />

Ho yeah, let's pretend that's what I said. But over there, in reality land where I didn't you'll realize that SURE these characters (the 3 warbringers) are oldshool characters, but when you put the fact that they all got the spotlight at the same time, <br />
<br />
<br />
Meanwhile the leader of most allied races.. let's see which ones have a female leader: Void Elves and Nightborne. Moira Thaurissan, which has been a part of the main Dwarven lore for a loooong time now, I guess you forgot that too.<br />
Are you for real now? Why did you left out the rest of the races?<br />
Why didn't you talked about Captain Fareeya the leader of the Lightforged?<br />
Or Mayla Highmountain the leader of the Highmountains?<br />
Or Geya'rah the leader of the Magar?<br />
Or Lady Proudmore (pick the one you want) leader of Kulthiras?<br />
Or Talenji, the VERY SOON to be leader of the Zandalaris?<br />
<br />
I guess having to admit that I was right there and that all the allied race have a female leader.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now let's see Heroes of The Storm: more male heroes than female.<br />
(gotha love the &quot;Now let's see ...&quot; as if you had made a point with wow...<br />
And yeah, OF COURSE Hots has more male than females, because the lore always had more male than female characters.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
OVerwatch: More male heroes than female... although it's almost 50/50<br />
Again, gota love how you carefully ignore my point about &quot;post release&quot; that was there to point out how blizzard released mainly female character after release in a deseperate attempt to reach 50/50, because otherwise they could be called sexist!<br />
<br />
<br />
But hey keep the people like you and You people up against people who are not even remotely close to what you accuse them of being... But then again, looking at your post history it's not surprising.<br />
Yeah suuuure buddy :D<br />

Let's pretend you aren't triggered by my antifeminist comment and had to whiteknight like a predicatable NPC!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spearhawk</div><div class="date">2018-11-04, 06:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is my thoughts on Blizzcon 2018.<br />
WEAK!!!<br />
Weaker than fart filled air<br />
There is no great reveals for anything really<br />
added a toon to overwatch and a co-op commander to SCII<br />
and what...? just a lot of chatter on how to create worlds in wow, umm, anyone interested in that can see in youtube how 3d worlds are made<br />
its nothing new or interesting.<br />
<br />
Blizzcon use to mean something BIG, Dramatic, AWESOME!!!<br />
Now its nothing more than whats released on gamescon or any other E3 or whatever...its nothing major<br />
<br />
and for THIS we are to pay extra money??? For what??? Ingame loot thats maybe worth 10 Euro, and the ability to watch game makers <br />
hug and congratulate each other....<br />
<br />
and don't get me started on the guy coming to the stage screaming HORDE and ALLIANCE.....he should crawl back to whatever cave he came from.<br />
<br />
Surely we missed the great names of Blizzcon like chris metzen delivering the feel of Blizzcon, that other guy looked scared to be on stage<br />
and lacked charisma to even light a candle...<br />
<br />
NO, to me this Blizzcon was weaker than World Wide Invitational 2008 (that I attended) at least there cam some news (Diablo 3)<br />
here, came an poor excuse of an attempt to do Blizzcon, I stopped watching after 3 hrs into how world of warcraft and classic was made<br />
after that its all just waste of my time.<br />
<br />
Blizzcon should be the crown jewel of Blizzard and bring out awesomeness, not this watered down poor attempt to do....Nothing?<br />
<br />
Nothing new, not even a map new for SCII only a poor little co-op commander that they spent maybe a month or two developing<br />
World of Warcraft? what was new, they already released in messages prior to Blizzcon basically everything that will occur.<br />
<br />
FPS rules again and gets all the shine...it is obvious where Blizzard puts its money, thats in FPS and the rest suffers.</div></div><hr />

Now, don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying every other aspect was amazing, but every other Blizzcon does this. They discuss current games and upcoming changes or future patches being worked on, and the other year they usually reveal the next big xpac for WoW. <br />
From everything I saw revealed, Blizz pretty much did what they always do. Overwatch and WoW delivered what I thought they would: new characters for OW and future changes coming for WoW. Hearthstone and HotS I don’t really follow, but even they had new reveals. Seriously, the only negative thing I’ve heard has been about D3 making a mobil app. That’s not Blizz’s fault people got their hopes up for something they never knew was coming, let alone an IP that has no where near the following it used to (note I didn’t say it’s unpopular).<br />
It just seems like the bandwagon thing to do is jump on board the bashing of Blizz for 1 bad announcement. Honestly, how many people saying “worst ever...” even gives 2 shits about Diablo? Everything else from what I’ve been seeing has been discussed by people with good views.</div></div><hr />

I assume you haven't read what I've said. I've never said I mistook them as first or second wave feminism.<br />
You assume I'm not one of the &quot;some people&quot; in my own words where I say &quot;Some people&quot;.<br />
You make several incorrect assumptions however this thread isn't about feminism and we're spiraling way off topic here.<br />
The topic was, initially, closely related because of why one wouldn't support code.org. It's only mildly about why we don't like modern feminism.<br />
<br />
Perhaps we should get back on topic?<br />

I'd say yes.<br />
But it's not just the fact that blizzard decided to make a trashy third party cashgrab mobile game when people were expecting and hopping for a REAL new game from blizzard, but it's also because they made that announcement the &quot;big announcement&quot; of that blizzcon by keeping it last.<br />
<br />
But that's not JUST that, if that game was announced next to other better stuff, like a real new game, nobody would have given a single fuck, but that wasn't the case. It came as a bad punchline to what was until then a very mediocre opening ceremony.<br />
<br />
WoW had NOTHING, Hots, Ow, HS and SC2 got &quot;the scheduled new content&quot; and NOTHING more (they don't even bother to show what they are working, over are the days where they showed at least a couple of new heroes for these games), and for the rest we got 2 remake of what we already had.<br />
<br />
I don't care about WoW Classic, I played it already, and when compared to today standard the game is just trash.<br />
The only thing that could be considered as even remotely interesting this year was the announcement of WC3R, it's YET ANOTHER remake, but this time at least they seem to have done it right this time (unlike the lame uprez of SC1), by taking the opportunity to actually rework a bit the campaign with some new intros to missions and all maps redone to align with WoW. But let's be frank, most people (me included) will only play the campaign once and that's it. The RTS genre is dead.<br />
<br />
The only thing I hope (and that probably wont happen) would be for blizz to take the opportunity to release new extension for WC3, namely BC and Wotlk. THAT would be awesome.</div></div><hr />

LOL what u where expecting for WoW??? a new expansion???<br />
<br />
SC been like this for the past couple of Blizzcon, every blizzcon a new commander. <br />
Hearthstone announce a new expansion. HotS a new heroe, Overwatch a new Hero and movie.<br />
And a new diablo game was announce even if it isnt your like is a new game.<br />

<br />
<br />
SC been like this for the past couple of Blizzcon, every blizzcon a new commander. <br />
Hearthstone announce a new expansion. HotS a new heroe, Overwatch a new Hero and movie.<br />
These things would have been announced anyway since they are part of the standard release for these game (also, I don't know where you got that movie stuff). People don't pay to go to blizzcon to get presented that kind of stuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
And a new diablo game was announce even if it isnt your like is a new game.<br />
Nop, a third party mobile game made by and for Chinese as a lame reskin of another mobile game was announced. That's a pretty difference that you try to ignore for some strange reasons.<br />

Dude, the allied races are literally stuff that was announced at the same time than the extension itself, dates of stuff we already knew was coming is nothing, and cut-scenes... really? Are we going to pretend that cut-scenes are wow content now?<br />
<br />
And as I said multiple time already now, the Ow character is, just like the HS extension and the hots characters, standard scheduled stuff that will come out no matter what and would have been announced without blizzcon anyway.</div></div><hr />

Blizzcon 2017? Look at the biggest announcements:<br />
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.polygon.com/platform/amp/2017/11/3/16603890/blizzcon-2017-event-news-recap-overwatch-moira-world-of-warcraft-classic-wow<br />
A new hero in OW, a new map in OW, SC2 F2P, Hanzo going to HotS, a new update for Hearthstone, and the announcement of Classic. Sure, Classic has happy people, but imagine all the people that don’t give a crap about it. Those were the 6 biggest announcements, 4 of which we got this year, the new map of OW replaced by a shit ton of info coming for WoW patch notes and cycle, and the new game announcement being Diablo Immortal, which could be argued that overseas where the mobile market is huge has a potential canvass bigger than Classic.<br />
I’m simply pointing out that most Blizzcons have the same info, and saying this is the worst one because Blizz announces Diablo Mobile instead of D4, a new Diablo xpac, or a Diablo Netflix series is just disingenuous. Hell, every YouTube personality talking about how bad Blizzcon is discusses Diablo, and barely touch on all the good news and things to be hyped about. Whereas if you look at forums about it people are discussing things they are looking forward to in OW, WoW, Hearthstone, and HotS. <br />
That said, I do think Blizzcon this year had the worst reception of news by the fans, but I don’t see the Con itself as worst ever.</div></div><hr />

It's not that D3 was an amazing game to begin with either - it only got playable with RoS and kinda improved but eventually got boring from there. But what they've shown this year is nothing short of an utter insult to the whole player base and the franchise as a whole. Almost as if they fully intend to kill off the name for good.<br />
<br />
If they want to keep the game and a good portion of their reputation alive, they'll have to come up with an AMAZING Diablo IV in not too far ahead a future. Or officially call it quits - equally viable at this point. Beating dead things, even if they're &quot;just&quot; horses would be vile.<br />
<br />
<br />
Although their most recent triptychon of Overwatch, HotS and HS were met with good success, I'll bet good money that the player base that actually made them great isn't a big part of that. Blizz has lost the link to actual gamers and seems to operate on the same money-grab-only principles every small and stupid mobile app &quot;studio&quot; operates on. While temporarily probably a good idea in terms of short term revenue, I really REALLY believe they butcher and suffocate their once strong brands in the process of catering to this &quot;fluke&quot; in &quot;gaming&quot;.<br />
Soon enough people will realize that tiny 5-7&quot; screens with crappy beepy sound isn't what they actually want out of proper gaming, and Blizz is going to be standing in the corner like: &quot;Huh?&quot; - at least if they don't start to remember where they came from and what their actual job is: After-work evening entertainment - the kind that displaces TV and engages you to partake in great adventures in your mind, helped by much more than some stamp sized screen and half-assed &quot;story&quot; pulled out of some rancid executive ass.</div></div><hr />

One thing people have to realize, there is no Blizz. There was core group of talented creative people with humour and charisma that created original series, and then there was corporation that wanted your money. Between expansions the balance was this way or that way, but once the original people cashed out, all you got left is souless leeches like Ion and upper echelon of corporate hacks. Those people never created anything. Fuck them.<br />
Also it opens up for other game companies to grow, so here's looking forward to Wolcen instead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Putting aside the usual tech issues and the pretty buggy Blizzcon TV app… everything was on point. <br />
So many technical panels. Sound, acting, live artists, cinematics, engineering and QA. I LOVED IT. <br />
That's what a convention should be about. I had great fun.<br />
<br />
On a sidenote, despite being mobile only (smart TVs maybe) Diablo Immortal looks like fun. Definitely not the worst project blizzard has worked on. <br />
IMHO, especially after seeing how hard it was to pull off, the DoA, QQer pacifying, absolute waste of money and resources that is WoW Classic is far far far far worse.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc79972df15a</div><div class="date">2018-11-05, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone else wondered why they increased the price for the virtual ticket looking at what they delivered? I was expecting it to account for the classic servers but those are included in the regular WoW subscription. If so, why was the demo limited for virtual ticket holders and people that were on the con?<br />
<br />
WC3:R and the mobile Diablo seem to be projects, that would be okay projects, if they were presented as side projects but instead the focus was on them. So how is it that Blizzard has stopped moving forward? Even if they're revisiting their past it doesn't seem like they're actually passionate about. As WC3 is still working it was the lowest hanging fruit to remaster. I don't see how it could be all on Activision (which seems to be what some people think) as Blizzard should be an equal and not just a contracted study (at least the title would imply this).<br />
<br />
For those that argue that people are just mad because they didn't get their game announced it's probably a matter of perspective. Car comparisons suck as they usually badly fit but imaging going to an event for your favorite automotive company to see what their lineup of cars next year will look like. You expect facelifts but would also be looking for new models. Maybe get a look at upcoming new features they might be offering. Instead they focus on how they're diversifying their brand to start producing electric scooters. No new models, no innovations just facelifts and electric scooters. Sure the electric scooter would be an innovation for the company and you can even use it to get around but you were looking for cars not scooters. Whenever scooters are an apt comparison for mobile games or not might be debatable but it doesn't change that people expect to (primarily as the big features) expect to see shiny PC games or at least console games but instead they saw something they didn't want to see and were told to be glad they even got that to see.<br />
<br />
<br />
BlizzCon isn't just the announcements. It's also a place where every last one of the people around you has the same love for the same games you play. When was the last time you talked to a stranger about WoW<br />
<br />
And this time they managed to upset those people enough that they actively booed. They didn't just reluctantly clap or anything but really booed after spending quite some money to actually get there. Doesn't mean they didn't have fun with the other like minded people but part of the whole package just fell flat. Especially for those that only virtually attended. Going the meme way about it: Don't you have a phone?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VanishO2</div><div class="date">2018-11-05, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Think it’s hilarious how many people say it’s the worst Blizzcon ever. Why? Diablo was the only announcement that let people down. Is that seriously enough for people to jump on the bandwagon of hate?<br />
Now, don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying every other aspect was amazing, but every other Blizzcon does this. They discuss current games and upcoming changes or future patches being worked on, and the other year they usually reveal the next big xpac for WoW. <br />
From everything I saw revealed, Blizz pretty much did what they always do. Overwatch and WoW delivered what I thought they would: new characters for OW and future changes coming for WoW. Hearthstone and HotS I don’t really follow, but even they had new reveals. Seriously, the only negative thing I’ve heard has been about D3 making a mobil app. That’s not Blizz’s fault people got their hopes up for something they never knew was coming, let alone an IP that has no where near the following it used to (note I didn’t say it’s unpopular).<br />
It just seems like the bandwagon thing to do is jump on board the bashing of Blizz for 1 bad announcement. Honestly, how many people saying “worst ever...” even gives 2 shits about Diablo? Everything else from what I’ve been seeing has been discussed by people with good views.<br />
<br />
No,<br />
<br />
And I'm not even using the current state of Blizzard games, specially WoW, that are far from the original Blizzard way of doing their games: Quality 1st. BfA is one of their worst products in all time (even text typos in huge quantity) as a base for it.<br />
<br />
Instead, I'll start with the greedy change to virtual ticket: Price increase and poor rewards (with the WoW mount moved to that 6-month sub campaign that left many people out for adding 6-months ealier instead. They should give it to everyone who did add 6-months this year). Then proceed to deliver a poor opening and poor overall announcements (compared to the same kind of announcements of prior years) and a stupid move about hyping something that would not happen (something big for Diablo).<br />
<br />
Not only that, but the guys on the stage for Diablo, mocking people for not liking their answer (for the question about the mobile gaming receiving many things from feedback that people gave over for the main game, if we would receive anything for PC at all), by taunting saying &quot;don't you have phones? hahaha&quot;. Yes, people have, but they want to play it on PC (the plataform where the series was born). Even the game itself is just a re-skinned game from those guys. It's ok to have a project like that, it's actually great, but it's not ok to do it as they did.<br />
<br />
Blizzard went from doing high quality products and receiving a huge amount of money because of that (and a lot of praise and recognition on the gaming industry) to trying to receive huge amount of money for the least effort possible.<br />
<br />
Remember that a few years ago, Blizzard would just decide to not hold a Blizzcon in a year where there were not enough things to show. 2018 would be one of those years.<br />
<br />
Player base/fans aren't some kind of an item that when you get it, it's yours forever. You never take them for granted. You never go reach out new customers/fans/players while leaving behind your current and old ones, because those are the ones that got you where you are now, those are the ones filling the halls of your &quot;blizzcon&quot; every year (and paying a lot for a virtual ticket, making the entire Blizzcon a really profitable product). Most important thing: You never make fun/mock them like those guys did.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only info we got is that there will definitely be another &quot;bunch&quot; of Allied Races, but none are announced. We may or may not see them until the end of the expansion. And the choice of specific races for becoming an allied race comes down to timing and where the story is going as much as community popularity.<br />
<br />
8.1 seems like a very boring patch, and one I may either skip out on, or play half-assed just to see the story. 8.2 seems more interesting, at least the Naga stuff. The Mechagnome stuff doesn't interest me in the least.</div></div><hr />
