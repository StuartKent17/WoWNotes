Patch 5.4 Arena Update<br />
You can see the UI changes here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3294-Fansite-Event-Recap-Arena-Team-Changes-Upcoming-Raid-Testing-Blue-Posts-TCG-Art).<br />
Big changes are coming to World of Warcraft’s Arenas that will make participating more convenient and competitive than ever before, and some of those changes may begin appearing on the PTR very soon.<br />
<br />
Today, competition is limited to the realms within your Battlegroup, and your ability to participate in the Arena system requires having a static team with friends on the same realm. In the upcoming Patch 5.4, we’re building on technological improvements we’ve made over time (such as region-wide matchmaking) to expand the pool of competitors and improve the Arena experience for all World of Warcraft players.<br />
<br />
One of the first things you’ll notice in Patch 5.4 is that you’ll no longer need to join or create an Arena team to compete. Instead, queuing will work much as it does for Rated Battlegrounds: you can queue for an Arena battle in a party of the appropriate size (still 2v2, 3v3, and 5v5), and your opponents will be selected based on the average Match Making Rating of your party.<br />
<br />
For the most part, the mechanics of Arena will remain the same. You’ll still gain and lose personal rating based on your wins and losses, though your Conquest Point cap will now be based on your Personal Rating. The rating requirements to purchase items will also be based on your Personal Rating.<br />
<br />
The change will confer a few advantages over the old static-team-based system:<br />
<br />
<br />
You’ll no longer need to worry about invitations, joining, or leaving an Arena team. Now you can play with who you want, when you want.<br />
You’ll be able to join a cross-realm group and queue for Arena matches with friends from other realms.<br />
The Arena ladder will no longer be sorted according to Battlegroup. Just like Rated Battlegrounds and normal Battlegrounds, now all Arenas will be region-wide. You’ll be competing with a field of opponents that includes every Arena player in your region.<br />
<br />
<br />
As before, at the end of an Arena season, the top players will still earn titles and mounts.<br />
<br />
We’re excited for these changes, and we’re eagerly looking forward to hearing your feedback. Please join us on the PTR when these updates go live to check them out for yourself.<br />

Patch 5.4 Official Notes Update<br />
General<br />
Redesigned Arena System<br />
<br />
Players no longer need to create or join an Arena team to compete.<br />
Similar to the Rated Battleground system, players in a party of the appropriate size (cross-realm groups are supported) may queue for an Arena bracket of the same size (2v2, 3v3, or 5v5).<br />
Each player will have a personal rating that increase or decrease based on victories and defeats against other rated opponents. Opponents will be selected based on the average Match Making Rating of the party. <br />
Conquest cap, requirements on gear and enchantments will be based on the player's personal rating.<br />
The Arena ladder will no longer be sorted according to Battlegroup. Just like Rated Battlegrounds and normal Battlegrounds, all Arenas will now be region-wide!<br />
At the end of an Arena season, the top players in a region will still earn titles and mounts. <br />
For more details about the change to Arenas, please see the blog titled: Patch 5.4 Arena Update.<br />
<br />
<br />
Classes<br />

Don't think so, you can't create a party with mixed factions, not even through RealID or BTag so I don't see why they would allow that in the system.</div></div><hr />

They didn't have the tech until they started on the much-hated CRZ. I can't even imagine the headache it must have been to get it to to work as relatively smoothly as it does.</div></div><hr />

Too right. No one will ever be happy with every change. This change has no effect on me at all, but I acknowledged that'll be nice for the people that utilise arenas. Battlegrounds need attention too and never seem to get the spotlight. Just tired of changes for arenas all the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You cant que alone.. its actually helping social in a sense if you want to see it that way. People are going to be going with other servers, aka social. And a benefit to arenas since youll actually be able to try diff comps to, and have a lot more players.<br />
it seems like a good change imo</div></div><hr />

I bet they implement a system like dungeon Q'ing where it asks you what role you want to play...but this time it wants confirmation you wish to Q for Arena. Should be fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or does 500 JP turn into 250 honor?<br />
<br />
Agreed; it is worded a bit funny.<br />
<br />
Currently, 375 JP converts to 250 Honor (you need 1.5x the amount you want to convert).<br />
<br />
With the change, it appears 500 JP will convert to 250 Honor (you will need 2x the amount you want to convert).</div></div><hr />

I'm guessing they saw that a lot of people were doing 5-mans just for pvp gear instead of doing BGs.<br />

They probably want you to gear for PVP mostly through PVP instances and not PVE instances.<br />

Then remove the conversion all together if that's how it is supposed to be. <br />
<br />
I get what you're saying. But there's really no need to change it. It's still not as efficient as doing BG's...it's just an added bonus to running heroics for valor 6 months after you no longer need anything from them but valor. Why remove the added bonus or make it more difficult to attain? It just takes a little of the fun away from the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason is simple, right now is easier to run 5mans to get pvp gear than to actually do PVP. So this change doesnt completely negate you from doing PVE for PVP gear, but the rate in which you would receive Honor will be better in BGS (depending on how much you win obv).<br />
<br />
Its not rocket science. Yes it is currently more efficient to run 5man over pugged Bgs. The convertiion rate is too low. You should be encouraged to do PVP to get PVP gear, the PVE convertion should just be a bonus, not the easiest way. Its more than logical.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mix of too, A lot of people didnt want to grp up with other people because of thier Team rateing. Other people didnt have the chance to play with some of thier friends because they were on another realm. These changes basicly eradicate those issues. Like it says you can play with whoever you want when ever you want without your ''team'' rateing going to shit because you left the team or your teamate left. Its all personal Rateing.</div></div><hr />

This is exactly the reason the devs should avoid the forums and NEVER listen to player feedback from the general community. So much whining and complaining happens from people who can´t even bother to read.. or even make an intelligent attempt at understanding the benefits of something.<br />
<br />
HINT - You will STILL need to pre-form your group before queuing. The difference now is those people you form a group with do not need to be on a permanent team with you AND you can form your group with people from other servers.<br />

Did you even read the blog post AT ALL? You can buy 489/496 gear with justice points, which mean that you'll be geared enough to run ToT without even touching Tier 14 You dont need anything else to spend JP on aside from the fact that it acts as a catch up mechanism. With JP you can currently buy Elder charms for extra rolls on stuff in the PTR, which another use for them. It does act as a catch up mechanism atleast in 5.4, dont give me that bs. I'll just take it you didnt read the Blog. The Honor gear is also not better than 489/496 epics, that is also bullshit.</div></div><hr />

Like this part:<br />
<br />
&quot;Epic quality (purple) Valor items sold by the Shado-Pan Assault now have their reputation requirements reduced to Friendly or below, and have their Valor Point cost reduced by 34%.<br />
Epic quality (purple) Valor items sold by all other Mists of Pandaria faction quartermasters no longer have reputation requirements, and will now cost Justice Points instead of Valor.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is going to get people in LFR even quicker, and skipping at least Tier 14...</div></div><hr />

Untill now, you disband team and rating resets to 0 = faster cap with opponents of low bracket (well not anymore)[COLOR=&quot;red&quot;]<br />

Blizzard fix pvp, give balance to the damn game. Then remove for ever all russians &amp; whatever nationality hackers that sell high ratings for euros. Then remove all bots !!!<br />
<br />
those are the news we d love to hear, not some fancy changes without any major impact...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hahaha, what? Nothing about this post talks about LFR. Calling people retarded is also rude and not funny. Please go away.</div></div><hr />

Plain wrong.<br />
<br />
Only thing that matter is MMR, and it never was reset when yoou created a new team. No matter if your team is @0, if your team average mmr is 2400 you play against 2400 player.<br />
<br />
The only way to lower your rating is to chain loose arena (refusing arena when queue pop, many times). And that will still be doable with the new system.</div></div><hr />

It was needed. People were just running dungeons, converting JP to honor and buying 476 PvP gear and getting into LFR too quickly. This change slows people down who are doing this.<br />
<br />
I buy 1 honor item when I reach 90 with the justice I gained while leveling. Yet I am in ToT LFR the day after I hit lvl 90 on a char. If you know what you're doing you can gear up really quick without honor gear. In fact, JP gathering goes slow compared to other venues of gearing (4 world bosses, 5.2/5.3 quest chains, barrens weekly, Thunder Isle rep, Treasure run / Incantations for coins + T14 LFR's).<br />
<br />
Not to mention that they're dropping a bunch of epic PvE gear on vendors from Valor to Justice so there won't even be a need to convert to honor any more.</div></div><hr />
