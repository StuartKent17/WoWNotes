Improved Shadow Bolt – this talent now provides a 5% spell critical strike buff (similar to Improved Scorch).<br />
Improved Soul Leech – this talent now provides Replenishment (similar to shadow priests)<br />
Drain Soul now has a chance to produce Soul Shards even if the target doesn’t die.<br />
Siphon Life no longer as an active ability but the talent grants the old Siphon Life effect to Corruption.<br />
Curse of Recklessness and Curse of Weakness have been combined into one spell<br />
Consume Shadows – this Voidwalker ability is no longer channeled but has a cooldown.<br />
Several other warlock talents have had their ranks reduced, their effects changed or removed. This list includes but is not limited to Demonic Empathy, Shadow Embrace, Eradication, Suppression, and Pandemic.<br />
Additional new talents have been added.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=700) / Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?druid))<br />
Savage Defense – this is a new passive ability. When a druid in Dire Bear form deals a melee critical strike, the druid gains a damage shield equal to 25% of their attack power. The next hit completely removes the shield regardless of how much damage was done.<br />
Survival of the Fittest has had its bonus armor reduced to compensate for the above increase in damage mitigation.<br />
Faerie Fire (and similar debuffs) now reduces armor by 5%. See Sunder Armor in the warrior update below for additional details.<br />
Thorns and Nature’s Grasp can be cast in Tree of Life form.<br />
Survival Instincts now works in Moonkin form.<br />
Replenish – to avoid confusion, this talent has been renamed “Revitalize.” It now also works with Wild Growth.<br />
We are also looking at increasing the sustained (not burst) damage of feral druids in cat form.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=600) / Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?warrior))<br />
Changing stances now has a much reduced cost: you lose a maximum of 20 rage (10 with Tactical Mastery). For example, if you have 100 rage and change stances, you will have 80 rage remaining. If you have 10 rage and change stances, all of your rage is lost. In addition, we may change the penalties associated with some stances.<br />
You now gain rage when damage done to you is absorbed, such as through a Power Word: Shield.<br />
Blood Frenzy now causes 2/4% physical damage done.<br />
Sunder Armor (and similar debuffs) now reduces armor by 4% per application, and is now a single rank. Creature armor has been globally reduced so that debuffed targets should take about the same damage from physical attacks that they did before this change. The net effect should be that this debuff is slightly less mandatory in PvE and is not disproportionately more powerful against cloth targets in PvP.<br />
We are also adding increased damage to Arms, possibly through Overpower or Slam.<br />
We are also looking at granting rage when the warrior blocks, dodges or parries.<br />

The warlock changes look fun. I can't wait to see what the new talents are. I might end up making another warlock after these changes. I chose a shadow priest over the warlock when I made a &quot;dps&quot; alt mostly because I didn't want to deal with the soul shard issue. On another note, if improved soul drain is getting replenishment then they are most likely moving it to a higher tier or the class that has the least mana issues to worry about just got replenishment at around level 20.</div></div><hr />

Now, in order to get more survivability, you have to take all of those points in restoration and put them into feral. These changes really make it look like they think that druids in pvp spec shouldn't be going for any 51 point talent but should hybrid across all three trees. Possibly they will make survival instincts baseline, but it will be interesting to see what ends up in that slot after they changed it so many times in beta.</div></div><hr />

The warrior change sounds quite unnecessary. I thought it was fine requiring talented to retain even a single point of rage. And yes I played a warrior pre-bc to bc..</div></div><hr />

<br />
You read it wrong. Not that I blame you because I read it wrong first too. It says that warriors that are in the bubble will not suffer rage loss. This is a change to make it easier for discipline priests to main heal a warrior tank without the tank suffering from their abilities.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Druid tanks are not trash. Your guild obviously puts more focus on avoidance tanks then mitigation/soak tanks. Druids are mitigation/soak and dks are avoidance tanks. This change will go further to increasing the mitigation/soak ability that the druid has. The reason I retired my druid for my paladin in tanking wasn't because druids suck. It was because they sucked to play. Spamming the same 3 abilities over and over and over with no real rotation and only one cool down kind of got old after doing it all of TBC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Any time you have a warrior tanking with a discipline priest healing? This change wasn't as much to help warriors as it was to buff discipline. Apparently, Blizzard is in love with the discipline spec because so far all of the changes made to priest were to overpower discipline even more and this change goes into that.</div></div><hr />

Well christ mate it wasn't tricky to begin with. We still have the penalty of losing some rage and the use of certain abilities. Also we have just as many buttons to press as most other classes.<br />
EDIT: Warriors aren't dominating PvP at all right now. In fact it's rather ironic you playing a ret pala and calling Warriors an easy class.</div></div><hr />

Is this really the spec that Blizzard thinks boomkins should be using in pvp?<br />
<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=0EMfuVhs0zhhzoZVMGoZcEh<br />
<br />
You shouldn't have to waste 10 points on talents that do NOTHING for you in order to get more survivability (especially when adding hp to a moonkin does nothing when they die in burst to 2-3 hits from any melee regardless).</div></div><hr />

Since the only thing I have ever used thorns for as a tree was in Old Strat to kill the ghouls that attacked me or when grinding old school instances as a tree you should feel sad if this is the most interesting change so far.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Read: Soul Leech, not Soul Drain. On Soul Drain that would be pretty worthless, but with Leech it'll be up pretty much all the time. And its pretty far down the tree.<br />
<br />
Something I noticed is that weakness and recklessness are now combined into one curse. What the heck? One increases AP but lowers armor while making fear immune, the other reduces AP. Supposing they remove the AP increase and make it reduce AP, lower armor, and make fear immune, warlocks can no longer really use weakness in PVP at all. If actually they use it anymore against rogues/cat druids I don't know, I haven't played my warlock for a while :).</div></div><hr />

Wrath has catered much more to PvE than ever before. Its almost as if Blizzard realizes that there is a game catered much more to PvP than WoW and is giving up on actually balancing PvP because they don't know how. They figure that any die hard PvP fans will end up playing this other game eventually anyways.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The two more than likely do not stack. Affliction locks really don't spam shadow bolts enough to matter anymore. However, this change will be very nice for destro/demo warlocks. It should actually help out mages because mages keeping scorch up was causing them to take a hit in dps every time they actually had to cast scorch, but destro/demo locks don't lose dps to cast shadow bolt.</div></div><hr />

Oops...so it is another destro buff. It seems like they are working hard on bringing destro into raid viability (even more so it is now if people want to argue its viable at all).</div></div><hr />

If by SOME rage, you mean they can stack rage and NOT loose it unless they stop pressing their faces against the keyboard, then yes they still will lose SOME rage. I would agree that ret is a much easier animal than anything a warrior does ( i dont play a pali btw), but warriors simply have WAY to much utility and burst potential (again...not comparing to ret...they are op too) to start taking off the only type of damage cap they have. Rage a limitless mana pool. If blizzard decide to put huge amounts of intell on ret gear....everyone would go ape. No rage starvation = warriors running around ready to hit 4 buttons all day, each doing incredible dmg. Thank goodness heroic leap didn't make it live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
But we don't generate rage fast enough for it to be considered endless unless we're bashing a low resilience priest or getting a lucky crit streak, when we DO get a huge amount of rage we WILL be in berserk stance and we have no reason to change stance, it's always been like that and still would be. Except now we have access to more abilities with little punishment.</div></div><hr />

Any1 think they could structure the T8 token classes similar to these staged class announcements? <br />
<br />
i.e. <br />
<br />
Priest/Rogue/Shaman<br />
Warlock/Druid/Warrior<br />
Hunter/Death Knight/Mage/Paladin<br />
<br />
?<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't know about the exact classes, but it's likely the new tokens will use different classgroups then the ones used atm yes.</div></div><hr />

Your guild obviously puts more focus on avoidance tanks then mitigation/soak tanks. Druids are mitigation/soak and dks are avoidance tanks. This change will go further to increasing the mitigation/soak ability that the druid has. The reason I retired my druid for my paladin in tanking wasn't because druids suck. It was because they sucked to play. Spamming the same 3 abilities over and over and over with no real rotation and only one cool down kind of got old after doing it all of TBC.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Why do people keep insisting that Dk's are 'avoidance' tanks. Avoidance scales like ass, so there's really no point in gearing for it beyond what comes standard on tanking gear. My DK tank has more HP, more armor, equal avoidance, and better magic absorption than any druids I know at comparable gear levels (I'm only missing a few best in slot items, and i'm 4/5 7.5). <br />
<br />
Druids needed this because before this patch, I can do everything a druid tank can, and better.</div></div><hr />

The warlock changes look very nice (yay for another class with a crit debuff and replenishment!)<br />
<br />
The Savage Defense change is to try to encourage bear tanks to stack something other than stam...but it fails. As it is now, higher level bears have AP in the 4-5k range or so and crit in the 25% range...so every fourth hit you're absorbing 1k dmg (mimicing blocking, or course). They'll just keep stacking stam so they'll become Prot Wars with 2x the hp, the same block value and chance (give or take), and 2x the armor (even with the nerf to SotF). Fail...<br />
<br />
I play a war and I dig the sunder changes...it was SO ridiculously OP vs. clothies in PvP. Now I can get healed by a disc priest and not be rage starved too...yay!<br />
<br />
Edit: @ topfer. No you can't...you can take less magic damage but you're hp pool is about half that of an equally geared bear tank. That's the difference. So if your AMZ is on cooldown, you'll get demolished by a breath, a bear will smile and ask for more.</div></div><hr />

On Soul Drain that would be pretty worthless, but with Leech it'll be up pretty much all the time. And its pretty far down the tree.<br />
<br />
Something I noticed is that weakness and recklessness are now combined into one curse. What the heck? One increases AP but lowers armor while making fear immune, the other reduces AP. Supposing they remove the AP increase and make it reduce AP, lower armor, and make fear immune, warlocks can no longer really use weakness in PVP at all. If actually they use it anymore against rogues/cat druids I don't know, I haven't played my warlock for a while :).<br />
<br />
<br />
The Fear immunity was removed from the curse and you can get a tier two Aff talent to negate the AP increase of the other curse. It's been this way for a while. :)<br />
<br />
If I'm reading the Siphon Life change correctly you will not be healed for the current minimal amount the talent offers but rather for the entire amount of each Corruption tick right?<br />
<br />
If so this is a HUGE boost to PvP. I could be reading it wrong as this seems kind of OP. Would we ever die in a BG?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only problem I foresee with this (assuming of course that by globally they are including boss and mobs) is nerfing Armor Pen rating. Armor Pen has never been a terribly good stat since the change to % based, thus, by lowering the armor of creatures globally would mean that it becomes worth even less.<br />

there is a buff that does this already. it's called BoSanc. if you stack your raid with a pally/war tank combo, there's no reason why the warrior shoudln't utilize this buff if it's available to him. making is passive is incredibly effed up. it's not passive for pallies or any other class for that matter.</div></div><hr />

So it does seem OP when thinking about soloing and in BGs: would we ever die in BGs with 3k Corruption ticks healing us from 5 different players every three seconds? But in arena with Mortal Strikes and Wound Poisons and Furious Strikes I bet it won't be terribly OP at all but rather what we need (at least in the Affliction tree) to survive.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing Demonology and Destruction will have other survivability changes as Siphon Life is requires 21 points into the tree and would thus prevent Meta and Chaos Bolt from being acquired. Well that is assuming that we're reading this change correctly lol.</div></div><hr />

Also, don't forget the Glyph of Siphon Life. Will that also increase the health return from corruption now by 10%? If so, that's HUGE. I can't imagine that change would go live with Glyph of SL in its current state.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm guessing that if this goes live and we're reading it correctly that they'll have to adjust the spell such that for each additional target beyond the first the healing is reduced by a large percentage. For example:<br />
Target 1: 100% dmg done/tick will heal you<br />
Target 2: 50% dmg done/tick will heal you<br />
Target 3: 25% dmg done/tick will heal you<br />
Target 4: 0% dmg done/tick will heal you<br />
<br />
So it will still be beneficial to DoT up as many targets as possible but only the first three will be healing you. Though wouldn't this be hard to manage? Let's say the first target dies: will the game adjust the amount healed from Target 2 and 3 and 4 to compensate? Yuck that seems like a mess! =p</div></div><hr />

<br />
So corruption base damage is 180, siphon life is 81 - The talent could be something like &quot;Returns health equal to 45% of the damage done by your corruption spell&quot; <br />
<br />
Still this can actually be a dps nerf if they don't increase corruption damage. Now, SL accounts for around 8% of my damage. in a 5min fight we would save 10 SL casts, that makes 15 seconds - 6 shadow bolts which would be bellow the damage done by SL over the 5minutes.</div></div><hr />

This will never happen. Blizzard won't put a DR on dots, ever. It would be easier for them to just say &quot;This dot can only be cast on 3 targets at a time.&quot;<br />

This is what i was thinking and will in all likelyhood be what they do.<br />
<br />
Another thought I had was that perhaps corruption would just apply SL to the target, the normal corruption tick and a second tick that does the SL damage and heals you for that amount. The only downside to this would be that Sl would heal for FAR less than it currently does because its a 30 second duration, compared to the 24 second duration than corruption. This would essentially just apply SL to the target when you cast corruption, thus only really eliminating 1 DoT from your rotation, but keeping the damage and healing near the same.</div></div><hr />

I dont really see how anybody could read it any other way. All these comments about DR's and healing for 3k ticks... <br />
<br />
|Corruption ticks at 3 second intervals, SL ticks at 3 sec intervals... Every time your Corruption ticks, you get a SL tick.. sounds simple enough. Its their idea of putting less stress on watching timers by removing one dot to refresh. It will be great for dot farming, great for multi target situations by saving a GCD per target.. sounds like an excellent change.<br />
<br />
The only thing I do not like about it however is it adds one more DMG effect thats directly tied to haunt as it technically now has an 18sec duration instead of a 30 sec one. Now if something prevents you from refreshing your Haunt you lose 20% dmg, Shadow Embrace, Corruption and Siphon Life.<br />
<br />
I suspect they will be making a change to some of those mechanics however so not overly worried about it. I wish they had touched more on Destro changes, as I had read a blue sometime around the last patch release saying they were looking into changing F&amp;B, which really needs it now that they have made Conflag glyph change.</div></div><hr />

I would agree that ret is a much easier animal than anything a warrior does ( i dont play a pali btw), but warriors simply have WAY to much utility and burst potential (again...not comparing to ret...they are op too) to start taking off the only type of damage cap they have. Rage a limitless mana pool. If blizzard decide to put huge amounts of intell on ret gear....everyone would go ape. No rage starvation = warriors running around ready to hit 4 buttons all day, each doing incredible dmg. Thank goodness heroic leap didn't make it live. <br />
<br />

So what do you play if you're whining so much about a reduction in the amount of rage warriors lose when they change stances? Theres still a lot of knowing when to use what.</div></div><hr />

i spec'd for kings, but i use BoSanc over kings because it's more useful, imo. i sacrifice stats for mana, because i can get the stats elsewhere. there's not any tanking gear with int or mana on it.<br />
<br />
i rely on Fort buff from Priests, but i don't always get in a raid/group that has a priest in it. i rely on BoM, but i don't always get a raid/group with a ret pally. i rely on MotW, but i don't always get a group/raid with a druid.... see where i am going with this? build your toon so that you can survive and still achieve your goal without buffs and you'll be okay. it's ridiculous that blizz would do this for warriors. if warriors are rage starved then there are a number of things that might be wrong. <br />
<br />
1) they're blowing all their rage on abilities right off the bat to sustain aggro. if they are having trouble sustaining aggro, then they're a shitty tank and should re-roll a troll hunter.<br />
2) Blizz needs to increase the attack speed of bosses so warriors will get hit more to increase their rage... OR stack a crap ton of Stam instead of avoidance so they will get hit more and get more rage.</div></div><hr />

Well perhaps that is true but if you arena on a Warlock then you know that a change such as that is really needed. If you find a really good Holy Paladin or Disc Priest there is a chance that a 2v2 Warlock team can do well. However you won't reach the top bracket (unless you're the #1 rated PvP Warlock in the world) and it will be a painful process to reach however high you get.<br />
<br />
I realize that this is not the complete list of changes (I did read the entire release of notes) but considering Warlocks are far worse off in PvP than PvE I was hoping to see changes that would help us with that aspect of the game. If you think applying two DoTs in one GCD is going to help us in PvP that is a mistake. Of course this is a great change for PvE but I'm not worried about topping raid DPS charts. =D</div></div><hr />

Oh I agree, Warlocks really do need some help in PvP. I just think that turning Corruption into a SL-type spell wouldn't have helped because it'd prolly be deemed too strong rather quickly and then it'd get nerfed and then PvE 'locks would cry that their damage went down and oh god its a QQ trainwreck.</div></div><hr />

On another note the change to soul drain is plain stupid(depending on the proc chance), even if the proc chance is good, the change is still friggin retarded.</div></div><hr />

I've got a MM hunter doing 3.5-4k in 25's still wearing three blues and the engineering helm and gun. Let me guess, you're a BM hunter who refuses to change from his devilsaur and can't figure out why it dies in OS every 20 seconds.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why should I HAVE to change my spec? I've always played BM and always will. But instead of balancing BM hunters, they trashed over 30% of DPS in one night ( ... not many classes can say that's happened to them. Not even the Retadins). I'm struggling to do 2K in 25's while your doing 3.5k? Way to achieve balance!!!<br />
<br />
So you're MM. Congratulations. You deserve a medal. And as for BM, we're relegated back to the pre-BC suckage days ... where Blizzard obviously feels we belong.<br />
<br />
BTW ... my devilsaur never dies.</div></div><hr />

Even after the nerf, struggling to do 2k dps is just terribad. I'd say this is rather a L2P issue then a spec/blizzard issue.</div></div><hr />

Hmmm .... Isn't about time your class got 30% of its DPS/Healing/Tankage/Whatever sucked out of them? The nerf Blizzard pulled on BM hunters went beyond any nerf they have applied to any class in the past.<br />

Oh, and on a side note, Idc what spec you are,idk what class you are, there is something wrong if you can't do over 2K DPS..... Pre-WOTLK in SWP people were pulling 3K+.... and now we have 10 more lvls and far supirior gear. And even if the spec is that bad, that's your fault for being stupid enough to stay that spec even though you say it has been nerfed to the ground</div></div><hr />

If they are gonna make the penalty so severe then they need to reduce the time of the buff, or at least let haste affect it. If it is set to 50% then at any given patchwerk type fight, the raid will wipe as the paladin healer will oom in about 1min20seconds without divine plea, and using divine plea will kill that paladins healing so bad it will also cause a wipe. This is taking an ability that made paladin healers good again, and running them into the ground. At the very least start with 35% less healing and work your way to a place that feels right. If they make this change, as it is, they will have killed off another good class, and lets face it, we are so low on healers right now it isn't even funny. If they decide to keep divine plea as it is, lets see some more epic mp5 plate. All the plate I see it crit/haste as of late. Now granted haste + flash of light is more mana efficient than mp5 + HL, but soon HL will no longer be a usable spell, and healadins will become a 1 button healing class again as they will not be able to afford to cast any other spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the plus side, would free up some talent points &gt;.&gt;<br />
<br />
Why would you be? They are designing this game to not have only one class bring a unique debuff. Hence the warlocks having similar debuffs to other class/specs. Raids should not be forced to recruit a mage everytime just for the debuff.<br />
<br />
And besides, Fire and Frostfire mages should rejoice because this is actually a dps increase for them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Something I noticed is that weakness and recklessness are now combined into one curse. What the heck? One increases AP but lowers armor while making fear immune, the other reduces AP. Supposing they remove the AP increase and make it reduce AP, lower armor, and make fear immune, warlocks can no longer really use weakness in PVP at all. If actually they use it anymore against rogues/cat druids I don't know, I haven't played my warlock for a while<br />
<br />
CoR doesn't render your target fear immune anymore. But yeah, I do agree that they are rather conflicting each other. Plus, I still want them to actually be in % other than a fixed value because what these curses need are actual SCALING.<br />
<br />
I'm so happy they actually listened to the community about Corruption and Siphon Life being combined. This is great for PvP and less cumbersome in PvE having one less dot to worry about.<br />
<br />
Destro locks really do drain their mana too fast, so I'm glad they added those changes. I don't know about them having to give the same effect like Sps provide, maybe it's the same reason as I stated that they wanted buffs and debuffs to never be unique that you end up recruiting a class/spec just for it.<br />
<br />
I'm so glad they're looking into those useless talents! <br />
<br />
- Eradication needs simply to be changed. <br />
- Demonic Empathy needs a change.<br />
- Shadow Embrace needs to be just 2-3 points. The 5 points was just pointless and how you trigger it is IMPOSSIBLE in PvP unless you are getting lucky with Nightfall. I hope they actually included another instant spell to trigger this. My vote is on Corruption.<br />
- I hope Pandemic is built in somewhere along Contagion, just merge it with like a talent or something. Affliction's bloatness is just way too trivial.<br />
- Suppression, well I hope this is about reducing threat and actually incorporating +hit in both Aff and Destruction spells. Would help a lot!<br />
- Consume Shadows - well I hope this is not another out of combat spell. It would be pointless like it is currently.</div></div><hr />

Affliction locks really don't spam shadow bolts enough to matter anymore. However, this change will be very nice for destro/demo warlocks. It should actually help out mages because mages keeping scorch up was causing them to take a hit in dps every time they actually had to cast scorch, but destro/demo locks don't lose dps to cast shadow bolt.<br />
<br />
<br />
Destro locks lose DPS to cast Shadowbolt. There isn't a single Destro build that uses Shadowbolt spam and does competitive DPS.</div></div><hr />

I'm more meaning the difference between scorch currently hitting 10% crit effect, over the 5% from ISB, which wont' be a DPS increase, for anyone.<br />

Also, while being the same class, Scorch is not the only choice of spells to get this effect, it's just the fastest.</div></div><hr />

While I basically love the idea of Savage Defense, I think that Blizzard is going to nerf armor way too much. At least we have some better use for Hit, Expertise and even Haste on our gear now. And I love Blizzard's circular logic: <br />
<br />
At first, they tell that we shouldn't stack agility that much. Then, the players complain because we have nothing else useful to stack like all other tanks. In return, they give us a new mechanic that makes agility (alongside with some other stats) even better for us. ::)</div></div><hr />

you do realize that a warriors survivability relies on their choice to want to survive right? I mean there is a DEFENSIVE stance for a reason. its good with a shield, that helps mitigate dmg. so if youre one of those warriors that wants to be in zerker stance while wanting def stances surviability bonuses... realize maybe you should just go to defensive stance. and hey with the new changes youll still have rage!! :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
They can only be considered a buff when you have a full rage bar and want to switch stances to use an ability. Right now, you can switch stances all you like if you have less than 25 rage. If you have 25 rage after 3.1, then switching will bring that down to 5 and you won't be able to spellreflect. And if you've played a warrior you know, more often than not your ragebar is empty, not full.<br />

This time they seem to think its reasonable to give all paladins kings just cause soo many of them have been running with specs that avoid it due to general inability to think beyond their own individual performance in a raid.<br />
<br />
I mean seriously give everyone access to a talented since release buff just cause they were avoiding it (in some cases due to bad specs). <br />
<br />
Make sunder armor less needed....<br />
Nerf DW which was one of the things keeping us competitive for threat with high dps members in raid...<br />
<br />
And straight after that they decide to allow exorcism (since release has been demon and undead only) to become useable on all enemy types.... and buff it against undead.... where is the logic? <br />
Ever hear pallies say they have threat issues? no they dont so just in case no paladin is intelligent or skillful enough to adapt back to a raid without undead targets to exorcise and holy wrath on they change a core spell...<br />
Right now paladins pull at least 300-400 more dps than a prot war in similar gear and basically doesnt much skill or movement where a prot war has to keep heroic up on every swing which although easy as hell is tiring compared to pressing consecrate and standing there refreshing holy shield and judging.<br />
<br />
To the pally whining about what they said about rage for dodging, blocking, parrying. Come on dude its about as vague and non commital as a statement can be from these guys...<br />
<br />
I do fine still at the moment as Main tank and dont have real threat issues ever but I have to work to maintain that and after the deep wounds knock on impact on protection threat (especially for AOE) seeing things like sunder be less relevant (when any non scrub raid should have a dps war applying it if they have no prot wars) makes me bitter.<br />
<br />
What possible reason is there for buffing paladin tanks yet again? which are clearly fine and have been since WOTLK came out, the whole exorcism thing is like admiting that most paladin tanks are idiots or something and I have a paladin tank in guild who is highly skilled and wont need such retarded changes to be able to tank in ulduar.<br />
<br />
And bears getting limited block....? gah? why? druid tanks dont have issues right now with survivability only idiots think they are hard to heal or squishy... Bears are great right now and as someone already said OS with drakes bears will be loling at noobknights who dont understand other classes abilities.<br />
<br />
So to summarise QQ if you are gonna buff all the other tanks that are already fine where is my positive changes?</div></div><hr />

u sir r very very wrong.... this rage mech change is a BIG nerf .. HUGE , COLOSSAL NERF. only comparable to rage normalization and enrage nerf . with this change we cant no longer stance dance to spell reflect/piercing howl ...disarm...anithing . i suppose blizz wants me to just swing my 2hander 5 times (to gain over 50 rage)before even thinking about changing stances.. thats ridiculuous .

I would agree that ret is a much easier animal than anything a warrior does ( i dont play a pali btw), but warriors simply have WAY to much utility and burst potential (again...not comparing to ret...they are op too) to start taking off the only type of damage cap they have. Rage a limitless mana pool. If blizzard decide to put huge amounts of intell on ret gear....everyone would go ape. No rage starvation = warriors running around ready to hit 4 buttons all day, each doing incredible dmg. Thank goodness heroic leap didn't make it live. <br />
<br />
again.. WTF r u smoking?.......too much utility? LOLLLLLLL , burst potential? u mean our crappy 30 rage sudden death proc that hits softer than our ms..(reck is a 5 min cd , and any warrior who dares to use that will die in 2 secs to any competent team..) NO rage starvation? u sir r very very wrong. if this change to rage does something is starving warriors to dead. simply bcuz no competent warrior allows him to get over 40 rage (unless of course when FF, anyway if u r being FF ull be dead.) again.. no stance dance to key skills as spell reflect / intercep/disarm...etc. say no to that change .<br />

finally some 1 who understands this crappy change to warriors , this change is the ultimate &quot;SPEC PROT AND TANK&quot; hidden message to Arms warriors. its just funny how many post about &quot;hey dude u can no longer lose rage&quot; . guess what my fellow non warrior user (or pvper) we cant stance dance anymore. no stance dance= no key reaction moves. yes u cant dance stance simply bcuz as a warrior using MS every CD and refreshing hamstring and doing other shit u wont stack 100 rage (as blizzard want us to). Being FF to get 100 rage isnt an option.<br />

<br />
Question: What does this mean &quot;Siphon Life no longer as an active ability &quot;?<br />
<br />
Comment: I have a level 80 Undead lock and I decided to reroll alliance and I am now at level 66 with a human warlock. I have always enjoyed this class but I have enjoyed it the most when everyone thought we were nerfed and underpowered. This way very few people play the class. While it was fun when we were a bit OP with SL/SL I have enjoyed this expansion because everyone seems to run by and attacks me with an over confidence. Then I proceed to rape them. While I am not looking forward to some improvement, I am not looking forward to all the bandwagon fans jumping back on and playing warlocks because they might become the next OP class...again.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jackoneill</div><div class="date">2009-02-07, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Savage Defense change is to try to encourage bear tanks to stack something other than stam...but it fails. As it is now, higher level bears have AP in the 4-5k range or so and crit in the 25% range...so every fourth hit you're absorbing 1k dmg (mimicing blocking, or course). They'll just keep stacking stam so they'll become Prot Wars with 2x the hp, the same block value and chance (give or take), and 2x the armor (even with the nerf to SotF). Fail...<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't know what kind of gear you got, but I have way more crit than this! In tanking gear, I'm close to 41% crit and 6.5k AP (fully 25 man buffed). So this new ability will give me something like 1.5k dmg shield. The thing I am unsure of is the part where Savage Defense gets dispelled on the next attack I do. This would mean, to fully benefit from that shield, I'd have to wait until the boss gets through it to throw another blow. Which means, seriously reducing my TPS. I think it would be good if the buff would just persist until its duration is over or all the damage gets absorbed and that you cannot benefit from another shield while you got one active (meaning if you still got a Savage Defense shield active and you crit, then you don't get a new shield).<br />
<br />
<br />
Why do people keep insisting that Dk's are 'avoidance' tanks. Avoidance scales like ass, so there's really no point in gearing for it beyond what comes standard on tanking gear. My DK tank has more HP, more armor, equal avoidance, and better magic absorption than any druids I know at comparable gear levels (I'm only missing a few best in slot items, and i'm 4/5 7.5). <br />
<br />
Druids needed this because before this patch, I can do everything a druid tank can, and better.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen any single non-druid tank who comes close to having the same amount of armor/HP as I do. Fully 25 man buffed, I got 42.7k HP, 33k armor and around 45% dodge. My gear is mostly from Naxx 25 man.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was not how I understood it, but if this is the case, then it's already better!<br />
<br />
The only thing is that now, we are already stacking stam/agi. With this change, we will just stack a little more agi to get more crit, but as I stated above, with already 40%+ crit, would it be worth it?

Not needed at all for feralresto's, didn't really feel like we could use a nerf... 25% of AP is nothing, and as it only procs when critting just makes everything even worse. Starting to get sick of this...</div></div><hr />

When a druid in Dire Bear form deals a melee critical strike, the druid gains a damage shield equal to 25% of their attack power. The next hit completely removes the shield regardless of how much damage was done.<br />

I don't agree. 25% of my AP while in tanking gear is 1250 (unbuffed). I got 35.22% crit (unbuffed again). This means more or less every 3 hits, I got a 1.2k shield that pops until I get hit. Most bosses hit me around 4-5k (melee hits). Which means I get to absorb 1/4 of that hit. IMO it is a very good way of making us capable of absorbing damage. Will this mean we can soak up even more damage? I don't know, since we don't know how much our armor will get nerfed down. But I think what Blizzard wants is to keep our mitigation roughly the same, while having a different stat to care about. But the thing is, I was already stacking Stam and Agi, and with this new ability, I will continue to stack Stam and Agi, so what's the point in having this ability?</div></div><hr />

I said it ruins feralresto, from a PvP point of view, not bear tanks. Since it's messing up the survivability because feralrestos don't stack AP. But since you didn't read/take notice to that, I guess you're completely into PvE, so I'll say grats as this was a buff for you :)</div></div><hr />

Consumable ammunition has been removed from the game. Arrows and bullets no longer stack, but are not consumed. Ranged attack speed bonus gained from quivers and ammo bags will be preserved in a different capacity.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So, why not eliminate soul shards? Why should warlocks be the only class that has to waste a bag? It would also allow the practical use of soulfire instead of incinerate. <br />
<br />
<br />
To be fair, Warlocks can put SS in a regular bag - ammunition cannot go in anything but an Ammo Bag.</div></div><hr />

You're right, I didn't notice this was from a PvP point of view ;D !<br />
<br />
I don't PvP at all, but do restos go into bear form sometimes? I thought they just stayed in tree of NE form, but as I you pointed out, I'm completely into PvE! As far as saying it's a buff for me, I'm not sure yet! We'll have to see how much our armor gets nerfed first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah... no. How do you think warriors/rogues store arrows and bullets? Or Engineers from another class, who create those thorium bullets?</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be fair, you must have never created a warrior, rogue, hunter or engineer. Any item can go into any regular type of bag, regardless of size (as long as slots are available). They reason for quivers/ammo pouches is to increase attack speed. Soul Shard bags serve no purpose for spell casting. All they do is provide larger than normal bag sizes in order for the lock to store up to a current 28 shards.<br />
<br />
Really, if any class had a justification for giving back a bag slot between the lock and hunter it is the lock. Now hunters get an extra bag slot and they get their shot speed bonuses placed somewhere else. So they get to make their cake and eat it too.<br />
<br />
Now if you are like me and never use your shards, especially now with the massive summons we can do, then you can replace your shard bag with a Frostweave Bag and be semi happy with an extra 5 to 10 slots to use.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't go through and read all the post here, just the first page so I don't know if this was discussed. If it was, just tell me which page it's on...<br />
<br />
Does anyone else see this as a DPS nerf? From what I read, it sounds like each Corr tick will also heal us now like Siphon Life did. That means its one less DoT on the target doing damage and getting a 20% increase from Haunt. It's also one less DoT to the talent Soul Siphon (Aff tree, teir 2) which adds an additional % damage to Drain Life and Drain Soul with EACH affliction effect on the target. Also meaning, Drain Soul will tick for less at 25% or less health of the target. <br />
<br />
It's fine if you have three (now four with Corr &amp; Siphon Life being one spell) Aff locks in a raid to max out damage on talents, but my guild only has two main locks; one being myself. We're both not alwayz in the raid either. It's usually just me... alone.<br />
<br />
Someone said to me that Corr and Siphon Life are just going to be one spell and both ticks will tick off from one spell now. Umm... if one spell is doing two separate ticks, fine whatever. But it's still taken away from Soul Siphon and Drain Soul.<br />
<br />
Can someone correct me on this and what that &quot;awesomely written&quot; new Warlock talent by Blizz actually meant... :o :-\</div></div><hr />

Never mind. Got it, but thanks!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">matornot</div><div class="date">2009-02-15, 10:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I heard that Destruction was being buffed, I was excited that my favorite spec would finally be up to par again, but as soon as I read what was actually happening, my heart sank and I'm actually pretty angry. It's true that the Destruction talent tree is being buffed, but the talents that are being buffed aren't actually preffered talents for Destruction spec locks.<br />
Buffing Shadowbolt is USELESS to destro specced locks because it is an affliction (and demo?) spell, and any destro lock who uses it should right now be thinking &quot;Oh THAT's my problem.&quot; Maybe blizz is trying to make it worth using, but then that'll just make fire obsolete again. The only thing Shadowbolt could be good for is when incinerate is losing cast time because of gobal cooldown when you're Backdrafted, but that hasn't happened for a good destro lock since lvl 75. The other thing is that a 2 sec Soul Fire crit for 16k costs half as much mana as a shadowbolt, effectively increasing your dps by lowering the number of Life Taps you'll need to cast.<br />
As for Improved Soul Leech, it's a nice talent, though worth nothing more than a little raid endurance. Hopefully the regen will make a difference.<br />
Also looking forward to whatever else blizz can screw up in the patch... I love finding out the Ice Stone has melted every 5 min for 24 hours.</div></div><hr />
