Not so much here, but on other sites most people just want to complain about Destiny not being on Steam. &quot;I have to install another launcher&quot;.. first world problems... blah blah.<br />
<br />
I'm on the fence about getting it. Destiny 1 ranks as one of more recent regrets. I have a group of friends planning on getting it this time around though.</div></div><hr />

This is an Activision game. Not a Blizzard game. Only relation these 2 companies have is holdings. Blizzard chose to have Destiny 2 on their launcher. Also hate to tell you this but when this site posts about anything upcoming in the news section it's essentially advertising it.</div></div><hr />

Given the significant impact Destiny 2 has already had on the WoW economy, via token prices, it would be an embarrassing failure for any WoW news site not to report this as soon as it became available.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since when does the Battle.net launcher go down for weekly maintenance, never seen that, sure a game might be on maintenance, but when for example WoW has maintenance, other games like Diablo / HS launch fine trough the launcher. <br />
<br />
For the rest its most likely to keep stuff under one roof and not having to give away a XX% piece of the pie to Valve.</div></div><hr />

1. Steam goes down all the fucking time. Without warning. Are you serious? <br />
2. Have you ever heard what having a monopoly can cause? People don't want steam having a monopoly<br />
3. Battle net launcher has never had weekly matinence. Yes some games have matinence once in awhile. But you can still play all the other games. Even wow doesn't have matinence every week these days.<br />

That still happens because most of these companies use their launchers to sell games exclusive to their launchers. So they still charge a lot and increase it however/whenever they want.</div></div><hr />

You do know you made utterly fucking no sense there right? If the only place to buy it was steam they could charge 300$ then say &quot;fuck you. Can't get it anywhere else&quot; that is a monopoly. That is why diamonds are expensive. They are cheap and plentiful<br />
But only 1 company sells them. So they can sell them at any price they want. And you have to fucking suck it up<br />
<br />
Learn how the economy works. A monopoly is the worst thing ever for the consumer<br />
<br />
BTW steam takes 30% of all sales from anyone on its market. So yeah there is a reason why ahit still costs a lot even though it is not physical. They ask for a lot of money for the server space and bandwidth</div></div><hr />

Yeah your games look like they cost a lot, but at the same time isn't your minimum wage like.. double that of the US and UKs?<br />

And to think that it costs far more here in my country than the average price for PC games... While I pay 99 for Resident Evil 7 PC (vs 199 for the XBO/PS4 version) for example, this costs 199 for the standard PC version...<br />
<br />
But not surprised since Blizzard also went for console prices on their PC only (and PC/console like Overwatch) products here, looks like Bungie and Blizzard tag along well enough lol.</div></div><hr />

not even close to Sims 4, MMO-C reports it b.c. its new to the B.net app which includes all blizzard game and now Dest 2. It makes perfect sense they would report on a new addition to the b.net launcher/app.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. Anyways, The studio that made only rpg-s is going to make a better Destiny? F. off... They cant even make proper rpg-s anymore let alone beat Bungie at their own game, lol. They showed pretty graphics soon expected to be downgraded anyway. They totally fked ME and shelved DA for it.<br />

Not everyone plays WoW and can buy tokens, and not everyone that plays WoW can afford a million gold (in EU that is, token peaked @ 274k gold earlier today, and you need 4 tokens) to buy the base-version of the game :P</div></div><hr />

Yeah your games look like they cost a lot, but at the same time isn't your minimum wage like.. double that of the US and UKs?<br />

No, I was kidding. I didn't mean to be insulting as you are right -- it's never good to insult people who don't agree with you. <br />
<br />
Games are much better when played with friends and it's certainly a reason to get it for consoles. However, you're on a WoW forum because you play WoW. Connection to Blizzard's friends list, other interactions with their interface, easily communicating with friends you play WoW with... among other benefits makes it a no-brainer in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

Well thanks for the apology at least :).<br />

I come here because I enjoy reading and debating/discussing with people mostly. I do play Hearthstone, SC2 and Overwatch on PC. But mostly my PC library is Indie stuff. I do play the Blizzard games with my friends but mostly we just play on whatever half the time. I mean atm we are all gonna be playing Stormblood this week on PC/PS4 since some of us preordered it for different machines but thankfully it has cross play. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I look at it this way and its been stated for years now.<br />
<br />
Some pre-order thinking they will somehow miss out on the game. There is no longer a risk of missing out.<br />
It's a bad financial move to pre-order - You are basically giving hte game company in interest free loan. $5 pr full price. No advisor would agree to that for any company. Great for the gme company, not so great for the gamer.<br />
Games are often delayed for months to years while they have your money.<br />
It encourages pre-order rewards. A practice that encourages you to give that interest free laon. It's a consumer unfriendly practice.<br />
Many games are broken and buggy at launch. Some have server problem for weeks to months after release. Don't reward that kind of game.<br />
The game might be terrible. Not all games are good just because you pre-ordered.<br />
Very few times the pre-order is actually worth your money. See link.<br />

Given the way the game industry has to me has turned a bit dark in what they produce vs the money they make. I no longer pre-order anything unless the given reward is more than over the top for the cash I put upfront.<br />

For the most part (and I used never and thats to strong a word and probably shouldn't have), I wouldn't ever pre-order a game and there is a whole lot of information why to not do it out there but as it also says, only consider it should the benefits really out weight putting any money down.</div></div><hr />

And at the end of the day the choice is down to the person. If I want to pre order I will. Me and my friends just did today for XB1. Also those links are opinion pieces. Someone saying a pre order is &quot;not worth the money&quot; is an opinion. Just like a few of your points are.<br />
<br />
End of the day neither you or I should tell someone whether to pre order or not. It's their money. Not ours.<br />
<br />
Me personally I pre order games I know for sure I am going to play. Legion, Stormblood, Borderlands 2, MGS5, Fallout 4 are some of past examples. Future ones or ones that I currently have pre ordered are Crash Bandicoot: N Sane Trilogy, FF12 The Zodiac Age, Destiny 2, Micro Machines World Series and Everybody's Golf.<br />
<br />
And no let's not blame Pre Orders for No Man's Sky. Don't be so silly. Let's blame the incompetent dev team and lying lead dev. But alas No Man's Sky is another thread. That game was not encouraged by pre orders to be lazy at all.</div></div><hr />

I don't agree with that. I think it's wise to not encourage people to pre-order.<br />
<br />
They still can of courase and be happy about it or suffer the problems pre-ordering brings. Either way, It's not a practice when someone asks I would tell them to do. When pre-ordering a game comes up, I fully plan to tell gamers don't do it and why. Yes, it's an opinion and they can take it or leave it.</div></div><hr />

I said it's their decision if they want to or not want to. Don't put words in my mouth. And again you do not tell people how to spend their money. Which you are doing. It's a fact you hate pre ordering and are trying to push your one sided opinion on someone. <br />
<br />
Read what I said. I said if someone wants to or does not want to spend their money who the hell are you and who the hell am I to tell them otherwise? You do not decide how someone should spend their money because you disagree with a practice. Nor should you even be trying to encourage people on how to/how not to spend their money. <br />
<br />
Me and my friends HAVE pre ordered Destiny 2 on Xbox One because we WILL play the Beta and we WILL play the final product. I will happily pre order games I want if I have the money at the time. Would I tell someone else to or not to preorder? No because it's not my place. Nor is it yours.<br />
<br />
You are entitled to an opinion. Not to shove it down peoples throats. Especially when it's a biased one towards money spending which again you have no say in how people spend their money.<br />
<br />
I have a bunch of games Pre Ordered because some came with nice bonuses. The practice isn't going away any time soon especially when it's a popular one and a good money making strategy.<br />
<br />
If someone came upto me now and asked &quot;should I pre order this game&quot; my response would be &quot;It's your money at the end of the day, not mine&quot;. I wouldn't tell them to do either because the decision lies with them.</div></div><hr />

And that is why I go with Amazon. Not only do I get things I want at 20% off Amazon will bend over backwards to make things right. They've taken huge chunks out of the price when a pre-order decided to not do physical discs so I had to download a huge game on my shit net. They've taken returns on games. Sure some games are not worth pre-ordering because of shady practices but when it comes down to pre-ordering something I KNOW I will play then I'm totally fine with it and the discounted savings.<br />
<br />
However, in the case of this game I get it for basically nothing because it is just wow gold which I have millions of anyways.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In a thread about pre-ordering, I am giving my opinion. take it or not. Make your own decision but when it comes to spending money, i'd advise not spending it pre-ordering. Its a bad habit for everyone in most cases. Rare are the times when its good for the gamer.<br />

<br />
In a public thread of pre-ordering a game, I am the one that read it and offered up why it shouldnt be done. Pretty simple to understand. I do not decide what they want to do with their money but I sure as hell can offer up an opinion on what they should do and especially so in cases like this. You don't like that. Oh well.<br />

I an pretty much give my opinion on this matter any time I want in this thread and especially so when part of the thread is pre-ordering a game and I think its a bad move to encourage that. Its not good for the gamer in most cases. You don't like my opinion. Well once again, too bad because around here, thats what this forum is filled with.<br />

[quote]I have a bunch of games Pre Ordered because some came with nice bonuses. The practice isn't going away any time soon especially when it's a popular one and a good money making strategy.<br />
<br />
Good for you. It's not something I plan to do in any large part. The practice of pre-ordering I can only hope goes away and if I can and when I can I will discourage gamers doing it and tell them or show them why. They can then make a bit better will informed decision on it other than falling for some marketing hype and a few baubles.<br />
<br />
<br />
If someone came upto me now and asked &quot;should I pre order this game&quot; my response would be &quot;It's your money at the end of the day, not mine&quot;. I wouldn't tell them to do either because the decision lies with them.<br />
<br />
The final decision does stay with themand always will no matter what I say but there is no reason to not offer up why to not do it if someone asks &quot;Should I pre-order this game.&quot; I'd say, no best not to and this is why. Still their money but now they get to make a better and more informed decision no matter which way they decide to go.<br />

Its not so one sided to the game company the way you have it worked out. You clearly are at an advantage that most probably don't know about or use.<br />
<br />
I could see some cases pre-ordering a game in how you mentioned above. Like the article said, pre-orering in most cases is not to the benefit of the gamer but in rare cases, like you have shown. There could be a time when it's advantageous to do so.<br />
<br />
Make an informed decision on it and not just because you fell for some marketing hype, baubles in game combined with all the negatives mentioned that pre-ordering brings.<br />
<br />
People will always do what they want in the end but at least this way, they might use a bit more reasoning when going about it.</div></div><hr />

How about people pre order if they want to and you don't tell people how their money should be spent just because you disagree with the practice? We good? Ok then. Never said I didn't like your opinion either. I said you have no right in telling anyone how their hard earned money should be spent.<br />
<br />
And if people don't want to pre order then fine. The decision lies with them.<br />
<br />
I pre order through Amazon as well because of their great service and discounts. Why wouldn't I? Tried other sites and their service was trash. Same reasons as Kyanion pretty much. But of course you didn't ask that of me did you?</div></div><hr />

They can do that anyway even if I disagree with it. They always could. You assume I have some sort of power of them beyond information given and opinion.<br />
<br />
<br />

No not really.<br />
<br />
<br />

On a public foums as this, Talking about pre-ordering a game. Given my opinion on it was warranted as thats part of what these forums live off of. You not liking me even giving an opinion means little as far as having the right. It's not about the right or not. It's simply giving my opinion based on the topic and a pre-order. Nothing more. I'd say the forum and thread existing gives me the right.<br />
<br />
<br />
And if people don't want to pre order then fine. The decision lies with them.<br />
As stated. It always has been that way. Your opinion or not. Same for me.<br />
<br />

<br />
Why would ask you? I don't care what you do either way but at least you made a better decision about it.</div></div><hr />

No because you pre-ordering a game affects me and everyone else.</div></div><hr />

His point still stands. <br />
<br />
If I buy a VIP ticket at Disneyworld to skip queues it effects every who has to queue. Same applies to pre-ordering if I want to who are you to tell me not to.</div></div><hr />

Not really. Me spending my money affects you in no way. Stop pretending it does. Again I shall spend my hard earned money how I want. Stop pretending me pre ordering this game has affected you in such a big way. It really hasn't.<br />
<br />
I just spent £27.99 on pre ordering N Sane Trilogy. How does that affect you? How does me removing £27.99 from my bank account personally affect you?<br />

I just find it amusing how people think pre ordering is the sole reason for shoddy game development.<br />
<br />
Yeah because games like No Man's Sky were shoddy because of pre orders right? Nothing to do with the shoddy development team which lied it's backside off through the ENTIRE development phase? :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

By that logic who are you to tell me not to tell you to do something? <br />
<br />
You realize I'm not making a law, just a well informed suggestion that benefits everyone. For the record I'm not part of the problem, but if you intentionally choose to be strap in for some criticism.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And how is preordering a factual problem?<br />
<br />
All I've heard in this thread is opinions of why it is. Which is fine. People are entitled to opinions be they really biased ones. <br />
<br />
Give me a solid fact why preordering is bad and why factually it is a problem.<br />
<br />
And also give me a solid reason how me spending £27.99 of my hard earned money has affected you personally.</div></div><hr />

I pre-order any games that I think are going to be great games. Especially from companies like Blizzard because Blizzard is known to make AAA+ quality games. <br />
<br />
I pre-order and will continue to pre-order all WoW Collector's editions, and ANY other Collector's edition of any new Blizzard game, regardless of reviews.<br />
<br />
Pre-ordering games is not some bad thing like you and your groupthink comrades say it is.<br />
<br />
Please give a compelling and VALID reason as to why someone SHOULDN'T pre-order a game that they like.<br />

Exactly.<br />
<br />
I mean all I've heard here are opinions and people are entitled to them. But I haven't seen a single fact of why pre ordering is a problem, why it's bad or why me spending my money hurts someone else?<br />
<br />
I mean how does my bank taking £27 out of my account for a video game hurt someone? I mean if it was their money paying for my product then sure but it's not. It's my money I worked for.</div></div><hr />

/wave hi back up Jaylock account. Enough of the pre order talk though no one really cares. Pre order isn't going anywhere so don't worry about it</div></div><hr />

Just asking for facts. So yeah I agree. Let's drop it when nobody can provide a factual reason towards the discussion.<br />
<br />
Also pre order discussion was bound to happen with this thread. Don't like it go report it and when we are told to stop discussing it by a Moderator we will. :)</div></div><hr />

You could discuss the game instead of rabbiting on about common business practices?</div></div><hr />

You could go report it to a Mod if you have issues with what we are discussing and let them decide what we discuss?</div></div><hr />
