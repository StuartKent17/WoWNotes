<br />
Patch 5.4.2 - Raid Browser<br />
Patch 5.4.2 updated the old Raid Browser interface to work across all realms for Ordos, Celestials, and Siege of Orgrimmar Flex wings. This has made finding a group much quicker, allowing you to list your character or your own group in the Browser, as well as a comment. <br />
<br />
The Raid Browser also passes along other information that isn't displayed by the default UI, as well as allowing anyone to message anyone listed for a raid, which could allow for enterprising addon authors to create an alternative listing view that would allow other users of the addon to share information such as achievements, number of boss kills, and groups for other things by using hidden whispers. This could be done without requiring people to make a mess of their friends list with random battletags or impacting performance when not looking for a group.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Addon - LFRAdvanced<br />
Using the additional information passed along by the game, LFRAdvanced (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/lfradvanced) will make the default Browser UI slightly more useful by displaying the item level of players looking for a group, the item level of players in a group, and the group item level. The item level is provided by the game, which uses your maximum item level, rather than equipped item level. <br />
<br />
It also shows other stats that are passed along by the game, but not normally displayed in the window. If you want to disable those stats, you can do &quot;/script LFRAdvancedOptions.ShowStats=false&quot;.<br />
<br />
It will also add a button to open the Raid Browser to the frame used to queue for PvE activities. The addon is still rough around the edges, but is a nice improvement over the default listing UI. <br />
<br />

Dampening Hotfix Incoming<br />
No need for alarm – we’ll be hotfixing Dampening back to a 10-minute start time (with Arena matches ending at 20 minutes). <br />
<br />
As you might be aware, the WoW Arena Invitational at BlizzCon was configured to have Dampening begin at 5 minutes, with a 15-minute round timer. Those changes were intended solely for BlizzCon, but made it over to live servers as part of the 5.4.2 patch. Again, this was unintentional, and we’ll be hotfixing things back to normal ASAP.<br />
<br />
no, but saying &quot;it will be reverted&quot; (Lore) isn't the same as PLAINLY NOT SAYING it will be reverted when asked (Holinka) but rather saying &quot;it's out there now, so gauging reaction&quot;.<br />
I spoke with Brian immediately before posting. Since his tweet, we had continued to discuss internally, looked at the initial feedback, and decided the right thing to do was to put things back how they were. There is no contradiction here, only the passage of time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dismiss Pet and Arenas<br />
This change was intentional. Unfortunately, it didn't make it into the patch notes.<br />
<br />
Dismiss Pet was frequently being used to bypass cooldowns on certain pet abilities, such as Roar of Sacrifice, or to swap out a dangerously wounded pet for one at full health. Neither of those were intended behavior. Furthermore, our design is that choosing your pet should feel similar to choosing a glyph or talent during pre-match preparation. <br />
<br />
With this change, Hunters are able to switch pets during the pre-match preparation period, but unable to dismiss them once the match has begun.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Posts<br />
Upcoming Paragons Hotfix<br />
This was an unintended side-effect of attempting to fix the occasional issue where a Paragon would melee a player from midair while jumping into battle. We're reverting the change ASAP (overnight restarts will probably be required), since the current state is clearly far worse. Apologies for the inconvenience. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/284286-heroic-25-paragonsnot-attackable-in-the-air/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10858675940#6))<br />
<br />
Garrosh's Trial<br />
Getting real sick of these books to be honest. I'd like to see all these story arcs in game, seeing as how Warcraft has always been a video game series first and foremost. <br />
We try to fit in what we can. There are a variety of factors that go into deciding these things. Time, resources, and (of course) whether there's some compelling gameplay to go with it are all factors. We can also tell a much deeper story in the novel. That doesn't mean there can't be elements that you can experience or encounter to some extent within the game (story wise). These aren't always easy decisions for the designers, but they do what they can. Our Creative Development team also puts a lot of work into the novels to make sure we do a good job of filling in what doesn't make it into the game and the book is in good hands with Christie Golden.<br />
<br />
I have to imagine this answer was unintentionally vague.<br />
I was actually intentionally a bit vague since I'm not aware of what specific elements surrounding this will make it into the game and in what ways (at current). It's all in development and consists of many layers. At the same time, we've already announced the book and that it will cover the trial among other revelations. WoW Insider has a nice look at it - http://wow.joystiq.com/2013/11/18/exclusive-first-look-at-christie-goldens-new-novel-war-crimes/ <br />
<br />
A point worth noting in the interview is the following:<br />
<br />
Is this going to tie into Warlords of Draenor, like Tides of War and The Shattering? <br />
<br />
It's more of a bridge. It'll take us from one place to the other.<br />
Dave Kosak has said as well that we want to tie in what we can tie in, but I couldn't say how much we'll be able to do or how currently. I also disdain being the bearer of spoilers when I can avoid it (which is sometimes more difficult that you might think.)<br />
<br />
I understand the concerns and this has been a good thread to read. I just wouldn't get too caught up in what is or what won't be. The expansion is in development and there's a lot of ground we'll be covering including a lot of great new story arcs and experiences. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/284106-garroshs-trial/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10827682992?page=5#96))<br />
<br />
Patch 5.4.2 In-Game Store<br />
When you go to purchase in game, you click the &quot;Buy Now&quot; option (after selecting the pet or mount you want) and an additional window will open saying you're being connected to the Shop. You'll then get another confirmation window that explains how you'll be charged. (I believe if you want to change this, you have to change that in your Battle.net Account options on the site.) The transaction should only finalize when you click the &quot;Buy Now&quot; button again.<br />
<br />
I didnt even see what it was charging it too? Is that what the confirmation window does?<br />
<br />
Because i pressed to buy now buttons 1 was in the window with all the pets, the 2nd one with the individual pets and then all my UI disappeared and a blue boarder came up and i got the mount..? <br />
In the second window that pops up it will say : &quot;This will be charged to your: [payment method ]&quot; right within the Shop Confirmation (above where the price is).<br />
<br />
We'll keep an eye on things to see if there are issues with it, but it should be working properly. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/284070-important-cash-shop-suggestion/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10787139397?page=1#9))<br />

I'd expect this kind of fourth-wall shattering garbage menu in a struggling free-to-play title which warrants the convenience of having players (and their wallets) engaged within the game at all times. <br />
<br />
In Warcraft? No. The online webshop has functioned well enough for years and the launcher and official webpage has advertised whenever new pets and mounts are available. The online webshop can continue to be used for consumable when/if they add them, as well.<br />
<br />
When/if Warcraft goes F2P, they can force a Paragon Market or Cartel Market or whatever they want to call it in front of everyone's face as much as they want. So long as it has a subscription fee, this button should either not exist or players should have the option to turn it the hell off without having to resort to a completely modified UI package.</div></div><hr />

Cars in Forza, ressources in Dead Space 3, Wolf skins in Call of Duty 3, Pets in an MMO with a monthly fee!<br />
<br />
This development will impact everyones playstyle over time! You guys are like oh it doesnt matter to me right now as I don't need these pets, or like I am not forced to buy them so don't bother me.<br />
<br />
But you will be affected over time! Its start with pets and goes to other parts of the game aswell.<br />
<br />
This is a game about fun, there is nothing to reach nothing to achieve that will leave an impact on you or anyones live beyond that what you want it to have.<br />
There are people in this game who define the fun aspect of this game as collecting all mounts and pets. Those people are severely punished as they can't achieve their own set goal in the game without paying extra.<br />
These players are already at an disadvantage. Whos to say its not going to affect what you define as fun in this game?<br />
<br />
Please stop buying this. Please stop anyone else buying this. This is going to ruin the whole industry in the long run. You think I am exaggerating? look around! Look at the examples I stated above. =/<br />
<br />
Its so horrible.<br />
<br />
Please stop thinking only about yourselfs...<br />
Please start thinking what your actions might to do you in the long run and to others.<br />

edit: Games with ingame real money purchases will always be designed around those regardless what the devs claim.+<br />

But you will be affected over time! Its start with pets and goes to other parts of the game aswell.<br />
<br />
This is a game about fun, there is nothing to reach nothing to achieve that will leave an impact on you or anyones live beyond that what you want it to have.<br />
There are people in this game who define the fun aspect of this game as collecting all mounts and pets. Those people are severely punished as they can't achieve their own set goal in the game without paying extra.<br />
These players are already at an disadvantage. Whos to say its not going to affect what you define as fun in this game?<br />
<br />
Please stop buying this. Please stop anyone else buying this. This is going to ruin the whole industry in the long run. You think I am exaggerating? look around! Look at the examples I stated above. =/<br />
<br />
Its so horrible.<br />
<br />
Please stop thinking only about yourselfs...<br />
Please start thinking what your actions might to do you in the long run and to others.<br />
<br />

To quote Ramin Shokrizade,<br />
<br />
<br />
The most important concept in this paper is that it's not just how you sell your product, but what part of your product you sell. A great part of the attraction of virtual worlds is that participants see them as a Grand Meritocracy, as opposed to the real world, which can often seem arbitrary and unfair. As Jane McGonigal points out, there is no unemployment in virtual space. Everyone has opportunities. Absolute care must be taken in the design of your virtual world to maintain this perception -- whether you consider it real or illusion is irrelevant.<br />
<br />
Selling the game objectives in your world makes your game unfair and just reminds your customers of the inequities of the world they are trying to escape from. They literally won't buy this. Sell them opportunity, in the form of content, and they will buy up that opportunity with an enthusiasm that will shock you.<br />

It's EXACTLY the same as the Battle.net shop we have had for YEARS....Infact no, it has less than the Battle.net shop even has.<br />
<br />
This makes zero difference to the game, this makes zero difference to development, this is not pay to win.<br />
<br />
No difference, nothing new, it's a faster and easier way to buy things we have been able to buy for years, it's a quality of life change, if someone really liked a new store mount or pet, they would buy it regardless of if they had to press a few buttons in-game or tab out and press some more buttons and clicks.<br />
<br />
The elixirs might be new, but oh guess what, you can PAY for RaF experience bonus, omg pay2win guys, oh but guess what, you can farm an elixir off the Timeless Isle and another Rare in a different zone for a 300% experience bonus, TOTALLY FREE! Yeah, still not pay to win. &lt; We don't even know if EU/US will even ever get something like this as well.<br />
<br />
Oh no the sky is falling.<br />
<br />
So far I've never bought anything from the store, I might get the fey dragon one day, still not sure, but people are taking this change by far the wrong way and context.<br />
<br />
Selling gear is a completely different story and my reply would be completely different and be in somewhat agreement with you, but until then, this is seriously nothing new and nothing but convenience.</div></div><hr />

You are the best example of what I just described. You don't think any further than It doesn't bother me so its fine. I don't want to repeat myself but I want to ask you to take a minute and rethink everything again. Reevaluate what you said, what I said and think about the impact the behaviour of other players will have on your gameplay experience.<br />
<br />
And this is a example of pay 2 win as some of the pets you can only purchase through the store are some of the best battle pets.<br />
<br />
And to be clear I never stated pay 2 win in my first post but you saw it everywhere. I mentioned the impact of player behaviour regarding to development of games and all you saw was pay 2 win which I never even once mentioned besides this very post.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think Blizzard prefers Open Raid to stay outside of its hands.<br />
<br />
Simple reason : moderation. Open Raid has rating and feedback systems, both allowing players to rate the &quot;quality&quot; of another player (which are exactly what makes Open Raid so useful). I really don't think they'd want to have to deal with complaints of customers about their reputation being damaged by some random comment on their profile.<br />
<br />
Handling paying customer to paying customer rating &amp; feedback is a huge mess, I'm pretty sure Blizzard would do anything to avoid this.</div></div><hr />

What part of paying for a little fire cat or bat mount is winning?!?! Please explain this to me.....Blizz isn't letting us buy Heroic SoO kills or 2200 arena ratings.

<br />
Its still wrong that a game that is already asking a monthly fee is doing this, it gives a very bad example to the gaming industry in general. The very hard obtainable mounts in game aren't even looking close as good as the store ones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everything is optional, there's no way to &quot;win&quot;. Some people don't give a damn about raids or PvP, and spend their whole time in game farming pets or mounts or achievements. To their view of the game, paid pets / mounts can be seen as &quot;pay 2 win&quot;, especially pet since pet fights, but also mounts for achievements.<br />
<br />
For some people, having a store pet with strong stats is the same as a store selling heroic SoO gear for others.</div></div><hr />

In addition, Charity Bundle pricing is not available within the in-game Blizzard Shop.<br />
Sneaky goblins, indeed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This shop button needs to go. I'd expect this kind of fourth-wall shattering garbage menu in a struggling free-to-play title which warrants the convenience of having players (and their wallets) engaged within the game at all times. <br />
<br />
In Warcraft? No. The online webshop has functioned well enough for years and the launcher and official webpage has advertised whenever new pets and mounts are available. The online webshop can continue to be used for consumable when/if they add them, as well.<br />
<br />
When/if Warcraft goes F2P, they can force a Paragon Market or Cartel Market or whatever they want to call it in front of everyone's face as much as they want. So long as it has a subscription fee, this button should either not exist or players should have the option to turn it the hell off without having to resort to a completely modified UI package.<br />
Go to Parental Controls on the battle.net account settings and disable it. It turns the button a very dark gray, so it's not nearly as noticeable. Except for the habit of going there for the Support button and being reminded it got moved. It's not anywhere as good as not having it there, but it helps Aliok somewhat.<br />
<br />
On the whole, I do support your position on the matter.</div></div><hr />

Not cross-realm. Cross realm is a night and day difference since it allows for a lot more people connect and group up instead of just on your realm. People did use the raid browser back in the day, but being limited to your realm only had it's drawbacks and sometimes you'd find yourself listed for hours, it became quicker to find a group in general and trade chat, especially for things like the daily dungeon.</div></div><hr />

That is the data provided by the API. Nothing that can be done about it without making another addon to communicate that information.</div></div><hr />

I like what Blizzard is doing with this tool.... but they are basically merging LFR into flex-modes. In my opinion.. oqueue and LFR are about equal, but the groups I get with OpenRaid are far superior... the reason being... player feedback and history. Oqueue and LFR are anonymous.<br />
<br />
I think this new tool is going to have a lot of problems like LFR has... and probably more. Not only are you going to have to deal with a lot of people putting in minimal effort, which will be kicked/replaced.. but you are also probably now going to have deal with Nazi leaders. ´ok, bottom 3 dps are getting booted and replaced´.. even if you have cleared the boss. I can´t tell you how many times someone started ranting and initating vote kicks because some random threshold wasn´t reached despite the fact that bosses were dying easily.<br />
<br />
I am going to ignore it and just keep using openraid for anything except world bosses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because they want to do it right...plus I doubt they foresaw the huge explosion in crossrealm pugging that flex heralded. Oqueue is basically just a clever use of the battletag system, which wasn't exactly designed with this purpose in mind, meaning there are going to be inherent limitations to its functionality. The group finder tool on the other hand is built from the ground up for the purpose of, well, finding groups. I'm actually curious as to whether the author of oqueue will rewrite his addon to make use of the new features. It seems a lot more elegant than having to mess with the battletag system</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was a fucking pain and boring as hell, since i know items have 0 value when levling and i just want endgame mechancis and encounters.<br />
<br />
<br />
they should added a 5-10 dollar fee to get an instant max level but make a tutorial for ppl , like 10 quests to do Before you can enter any raid or dungeon on how mechanics works for pvp and pve questing and Everything then you can do a dungeon after completed 5 dungeons on normal you can do 5 hc then you can do lfr and then you can do whatever you so choose.<br />
<br />
Since u need to gear up anyway for raiding this is a good way to do it.<br />
<br />
experienced players sure wouldnt like it as much but it would still be a gearup for raids and such, allthou now exists timeless so this kinda goes against it but like Before we had wotlk dungeon hc for gear up anyway. and steamrolling thru 5 dungeons takes approxx 10-15 min a run.<br />
<br />
wich wouldnt be to much, plus maybe you find some transmog gear and such.<br />
<br />
Well yeah now im just ranting but you get the Point levling is tedious, and ofc buy level to max level should be locked for a week or two at the expansion release.<br />
<br />
and mounts and bags that is souldbound should be able to buy and, mountspeed maybe i dont know.<br />
<br />
but anyway things that dont effect economy.<br />
<br />
or gives huge advantages and also Money aint a problem for raiding Guilds hell in vanilla tbc even hardcore Guilds bought and got gold from fanboys on the server, how is this fair then? :)</div></div><hr />
