just figured: if Dk-Armors do not upgrade themselves while leveling(e.g. no items needed, lol, yeah right, i should bitchslap my thoughts for that) they will most probably NOT look like what we see on these screens(cuz they'll be starting with awesome lv55 equip and trade it in at lv 58 for the drugged up outland random model-recycling-shit, looking like, heh, penny arcade, actiontrip, they all made strips about that back then)<br />
lolz</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, those are horns mounted on his Hexx Lord's Voodoo Pauldrons, not his actual horns.</div></div><hr />
