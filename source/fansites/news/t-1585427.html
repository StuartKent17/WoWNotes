<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arandompcgamer</div><div class="date">2014-09-03, 01:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So let me get this straight. My boomkin which is doubling my fire mages dmg in a bg, while being unkillable is getting a dmg buff (the only spellcaster close is shadow priest), fire is getting a nerf to fireball and pyroblast. My ret paladin which isn't as op as feral/dk on the beta is getting more dmg back so that i can kill people in 5 seconds instead of 6 while under wings/seraphim (awesome gameplay), while doubling my fire mages damage in a bg. Cool Blizzard. Might want to look at the meta data from BG's seeing that when playing my boomkin/shadow priest I have been so far above the next DPS in dmg that it is laughable, and it was always a DK/Ret behind me. Then again seeing that in the Bajheera/Holinka video, Holinka literally did not even heal himself on his DK? Maybe Blizzard really is this clueless. Hope Blizzard enjoys all the mages rerolling to Shadow Priests/Boomkins, and all the melee to feral/dk, or even worse idiotic tank specs, cus that worked so well in SWTOR...</div></div><hr />

You understand that this will only be used on MoP gear, and only be useful for the last month of the expansion, right? So you don't actually have to farm anything. You'll be leveling to 100 in a few weeks.</div></div><hr />

So, you're mad. You're mad that zones that had an average of ~4 players in them now behave like MMO's, and you're mad that the spawn cycles that were designed to function with many, many more players in the area are now seeing that number. So, you're mad it's an MMO and not a single-player game with crappy graphics.<br />
<br />
Stop being mad, bro. It's an MMO. If you want stuff handed to you, you really shouldn't be playing this game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In MMOs you can add a player you see on friend list and join their guild or invite them to your guild. Generally you see this same people many times in your game...thats how is on MMOs. People from other servers that may disappear in the next corner and you cannot trade with them or join guilds are just a stupid mechanic. <br />
<br />
Also I play since Vanilla and in a top populated server and never, never, have been with 4-5 others on the same step of every quest I am doing or find 2-3 others in every rare spawn point...this is ridiculous and if they designed it like this they should have at least 5x server capacity from the beginning cause world was never so much populated. And lastly if this is their design intention, is a bad design.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The zones were designed where the players whom were originally supposed to be farming the stuff couldn't pull everything at once and kill it, thus monopolizing it all. As time goes on a lower % of players go to farm any piece of content, this helps balance out an individuals chance of achieving their farming goal. CRZ makes it far harder to farm rep than originally intended, unless you have good instant ranged attacks with no cd. It pushes zone density back to what it was when content was current (for some areas) yet with casters able to pull everything at once, melee become completely unable to farm at even 1/10 the rate as when content was current.<br />
<br />
For the affliction warlock who can just run around and compete by instantly dotting everything in existence this isn't a problem. For the Paladin who lacks good movement or spammable range spells high player density completely shuts him down.</div></div><hr />

I agree. It would be much better if we could trade with every one and raid with every one. There should not be a server restriction anymore. I found some really great guys to raid with since they allowed cross realm heroic raiding, but Blizzard is going to stop this with WoD for no reason. It doesn't make sense why you should not be allowed to raid cross realm mythic in WoD. <br />
WoW today should feel like one big server and not several very small ones. There are probably 2 or 3 server which seem to be alive :(</div></div><hr />

Except that &quot;things change&quot; only for one side. Things should change for the zone too, because... rules changed.<br />

<br />
Stop being mad, bro. It's an MMO. If you want stuff handed to you, you really shouldn't be playing this game.<br />
<br />
Nope, the zone was designed to function with weaker players and with a population that would, as times goes by, &quot;age&quot; and move on. Not to get a constant influx of new one-shotting powerful players comming everyday. The load is far higher than a high-pop server would have by now (you're expanding the universe of ppl who would want to do that by a LOT), but the game rules for that area didn't change to acommodate that as it should.<br />
<br />
It's exactly the same crap for rares, resources, etc and why they changed the spawn rates to match the waaaay higher number of players.</div></div><hr />

Did anyone notice if the textures were updated on the hammer? They seem like they might be but I cannot tell.</div></div><hr />

If players made a group in Skettis, both of them would get rep faster. But they are too lazy to do that so they complain.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">markdall</div><div class="date">2014-09-03, 07:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why does being from another server make them different in a bad way?<br />
<br />
Because you can't join each other's guilds, trade with 'em, or hold them accountable in any way whatsoever. <br />
<br />
MMORPG isn't generally thought to mean Massively Anonymous Multiplayer Role Playing Game. Sure, you don't know everybody on your server, but at least if they keep playing the same character you can remember them for next time. <br />
<br />
I left my PVP server partially over CRZ. For PVP servers, CRZ is just a blight on the game. Gankers who are there and gone, no way to get 'em back? Griefers love it, everybody else thinks Blizzard is channeling Comcast or something.<br />
<br />
In the end, the most important part of the MMORPG acronym is the G for Game, and a Game should be fun. CRZ has never made or caused me to have fun. I've never had a single interaction with CRZ that increased the fun, or was even 'fun neutral'. Every time I notice CRZ, it's because it has made my experience less fun.</div></div><hr />

I believe what they mean by this is like the the gear tokens in TI, you'll be able to just click on it and it will become the tier piece you need. No more needing the token plus the Valor,JP whatever you need along with the token and no more having to wait til after the raid or holding up the raid while you play the ever popular game of where the hell is the tier vendor =P</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are &quot;rediclously op&quot; on all &lt;1m wipes...which is what you normally see on Beta Testing....This is 100% true.<br />
<br />
<br />
They were middle of the pack on 5-6 minute kills...now they will be less than middling.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
STOP NERFING ENH TOTAL DAMAGE FROM INITIAL BURST NUMBERS! <br />
(and don't tell me they aren't...cause the community knows better...they have done it every MoP tier and had to &quot;re-buff&quot; on the odd tiers cause they went overboard)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not a new model. It's literally the exact same looking as the one from TBC. Not even the texture has been updated.</div></div><hr />

I'm talking sustained damage here, not some stupid 1 minute dps race with bloodlust and cooldowns.<br />
<br />
I know this is just a datamine from a patch halfway through, but this still irks me. Last time the response was: &quot;You have to see the bigger picture&quot;, but then I see some of the stronger beta classes getting buffed and I'm just flabbergasted. <br />
<br />
Normally I'd say beta=beta; but past history has proven time and time (all expansions: TBC/WotLK/Cata/MoP) that shamans tend to be on the low side of things in the early expansions.</div></div><hr />
