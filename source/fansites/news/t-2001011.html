Warcraft Movie - Garona Featurette<br />
A Garona featurette has been released! More movie reviews are out, with positive reviews from fans and mixed reviews from critics. <br />

Vanilla Dungeon Objective XP Nerf<br />
What Id love to know is why this was done so stealthily.<br />
I have no issues with 1-40 being harder, but why nerf BC and Wrath dungeon xp?<br />
What's the basis for this claim? We didn't touch BC or Wrath dungeon experience. <br />
<br />
One additional bullet point that should have been in yesterday's hotfix notes is that we did reduce the experience from the dungeon &quot;scenario&quot; objectives for Classic dungeons (levels 15-58). Those awards were new as of Warlords, but for low-level dungeons they were largely were redundant with the numerous quests available inside each dungeon. Dungeons are intended to be rewarding, and they still are, but zoning into Deadmines and completing ~5 quests, plus the kill experience for everything, plus a couple more quests' worth of experience from the dungeon objectives, was overkill. When we looked at low-level dungeons and tried to understand what had changed to make them so much more lucrative over time, that bonus objective experience immediately stood out. <br />
<br />
There wasn't any intent to hide this change (it's not a subtle change, and obviously it was immediately noticed). There were a total of 8 different hotfixes rolled out over the past week or two as part of this entire plan, and that one just slipped through the cracks when we were writing up the documentation of the changes.<br />

PvP Gear Item Levels<br />
Hey guys! Just want to correct the basis for this discussion.<br />
<br />
Currently, what's going on with the ilvl for gear from rated PvP in Legion is: it's decided dynamically when it's rewarded to you, and that decision is based on your rating.<br />
<br />
So while the lowest version of an item may be 870, it will have its ilvl increased to 880, 890, or 900 -- based on your rating.

Discipline Priest -- Legion Beta Feedback<br />
Thanks for all the feedback. To revisit something that we touched on back at Blizzcon, but perhaps haven't talked about since then: Discipline is the most complex healer to play in 7.0 by a wide margin, and is possibly the most advanced core rotation of any spec. We know this and are generally okay with it, even though we still want to manage it within reason. It is to some extent inevitable due to the mixture of DPS- and heal-type targeting that Disc has to frequently swap between, something that no other spec asks of you outside of specific talents. Also, Disc is intentionally positioned against Holy, which is one of the more accessible healers in 7.0.<br />
<br />
Feedback from all players is still very useful for looking at potential skill-floor issues, but 7.0 Discipline is intended to be something you opt into if you are seeking out the mixed DPS/heal gameplay that it's built around.

Blue Tweets<br />
What happened to the awesome class titles like Highlord that you got from completing the artifact quest in alpha?<br />
Felt premature to award titles like those so quickly. They are now earned by completing your Class Order campaign. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/733431773829292032))<br />
<br />
The drop rate on the archi mount is being reduced on the pre xpac patch ?<br />
No - Mythic Archimonde and Blackhandâ€™s mounts will become rare drops when Legion launches. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/733431832876699648))<br />

You don't even need reviews to reach these conclusions. The previews and sneak peaks are full of awkward acting and ugly CGI.<br />

If you realy hate everything so much stop playing this game and find something you do enjoy.<br />
<br />
Most people never said anything and accepted the way things are. Yet we got all bshit of loud minorty. Lfg, lfr and all other bshit. I never asked for it and many never said anything but still got this crap because os loud minority. Still you dont hear us as we just accept game for what it is.<br />
<br />
Always whiny loud minority you hear and those are one that ruines the game. And then change happens and other loud minority starts to bitch.<br />
<br />
Rest of us you do not hear we either keep try to enjoy what we got or we leave.<br />

Believe me guys, it's totally worth watching. Ther are some retcona. Its alternative worls. Still you can really enjoy movie. No matter you are hardcore wow player and lore fan like me or you have no idea what warcraft is.<br />
<br />
I think, no matter some stuff and even unanswered queations, this movie is worth of waiting. And at long last we have a movie based on game. And it doesnot suck.<br />
<br />
Spells are awesome. Story is realky good with minor changes. And those changes are moatly acceptable and even very interesting.<br />
Orcs are done as good as probably Avatar Navii race and beasts. Even dire wolves look great. And battles and dialogues are mostly good. At one point u can see that sword of soldier aint real. But thata very minor and rare buisabce</div></div><hr />

-I loved your review, it's the best i have seen and i advise any1 that want a solid review to watch yours.<br />
-I just watched the movie and i must say that i enjoyed it but it could have been better....<br />
-My Review:<br />
*The visuals for me were perfect, the action scenes are good for the most part but the last battle could have been better.<br />
*the characters didn't all get a good build for example Guldan was PERFECT, no one is gonna come out of the movie and not love Guldan evil character, Kadgar was a funny character, Lothar is good but could have been better, Garrona...not so much, on the orc side they were overall good. Overall about the characters there was no character that made me feel like i wish i was him or gave me a attachment to him, for example on GoT when one of the characters die you feel like one of your own friends or kin died even tho Warcraft is not to be compered to GoT (one is a 2h movie vs a 6 season series).<br />
*An other critic is sometimes the movie feel like it is dragging on even tho fantasy movies tend to do that but the drag was not well made all the time.<br />
*A final think I would like to add is that I wish that the movie wasn't made to hit a middle ground between WoW fans and non-fans but rather be targeted to the fans cause, even tho it is in the middle ground, unless you know what the story of the warcraft universe you won't understand a lot of it, and the story of warcraft universe is a good one. I really hated that Stormwind was not destroyed in this story, that would have made a better overall story (inb4 any1 bash me on that I would like to say that I am ''For the Alliance'') <br />
(I went with my friend that have no idea about warcraft or wow and his initial thought was ''it's a nice movie, it was fun but i was waiting for a bigger thing'' BUT when I started to explain to him some of the backstory of some of the characters he was like ''AH...now I understand what/why it happened'' and ''oh that's was well made then'' but before that it he was just ''it's an OK movie'')<br />
*I don't really like to put a grade on movies but since that's how ppl understand, I will put a 6.5/10 for someone that is not a fan of warcraft and a 7.5-8/10 for a warcraft fan.<br />
As for recommendation, I recommended for a warcraft fan any day but not so sure for non-fans.</div></div><hr />

I have one question. It's clear that we see both high elves and dwarves in the film. How do the high elves look though? Do they look cgi? More actors? Do they say anything?</div></div><hr />

they look good but ''you don't have to worry about them since they only have like &lt;1 min of screen time spread on a 2h film and yes they say like one or 2 sentences''</div></div><hr />

My question is about the music in the movie. I have not seen the music mentioned in any review. Is it because the music is bad or that it doesn't call attention to itself? The music is a really big plus to the game, is it forgettable in the movie?</div></div><hr />

<br />
you can go on YT and check what is the music used in the film, it's similar to some of the WoW music but it's not the same tracks.<br />
but movie music is meant to be in the backround and unless intended they should not stood out like some of the in-game music but if you focus to listen to them then you can hear them.<br />
But anyway in term of music it was done well in the movie.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The elves look acceptable if a bit odd with their giant floopy ears next to humans. If we had more time with them, I'm sure we coueld get used to the bastards, but as stated above by THE313, they're hardly in the movie. The Dwarves look really, really dwarvish, and they have maybe one more sentence than the elves. I liked them. :) <br />

<br />
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uriUPxg-YVo &lt;-- THIS music is the main theme. Most music is a variation on in, with the very rare punch of classic WoW tunes being sprinkled in here and there (Like when we first see Stormwind). I'd say the music is serviceable and can hit the right oomphs at the right times, but we both know that the moment the DVD hits, someone is recutting the entire movie with a soundtrack entirely from the games. :P</div></div><hr />

22% is &quot;mixed reviews&quot;? How low will it have to drop before the reviews count as &quot;bad&quot;?</div></div><hr />
