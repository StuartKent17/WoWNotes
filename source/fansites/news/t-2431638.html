<br />
Pirate's Day Live<br />
Pirate's Day is back again! Nothing new this year, but it was updated last year.<br />
<br />
<br />
Check out the little beach party just south of Booty Bay!<br />
The Jolly Roger (http://www.wowdb.com/items/150547-jolly-roger) toy is back again! It is purchasable from Edward Techt (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/122396-edward-techt) for those that have completed Avast Ye, Admiral! (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/4621-avast-ye-admiral).<br />
You can purchase Big Bag of Booty (http://www.wowdb.com/items/116392-big-bag-of-booty) from Dread Captain DeMeza (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/28048-dread-captain-demeza) to transfer gold between servers with a 5% loss. <br />
Kill Ol' Eary (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/108715-ol-eary) to get the Slightly-Chewed Insult Book (http://www.wowdb.com/items/138415-slightly-chewed-insult-book) toy.<br />
Completing You're Gonna Need A Bigger Boat! (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/42758-youre-gonna-need-a-bigger-boat) rewards Emergency Pirate Outfit (http://www.wowdb.com/items/138414-emergency-pirate-outfit)<br />
Drink with Dread Captain DeMeza (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/28048-dread-captain-demeza) to earn The Captain's Booty (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/3457-the-captains-booty)<br />
<br />
<br />
Hoist sail and make way for Booty Bay because it’s Pirate’s Day!<br />
<br />
Bring Your Sea Shanty to Booty Bay<br />
Pirates have taken over the goblin town of Booty Bay and Captain DeMeza is recruiting any scurvy dog she can into her buccaneer ranks. Visit her or her henchmen in the capital cities if the pirate’s life is for you!<br />
<br />
Feeling out of place in Booty Bay without a proper costume? Don’t worry. /Dance one little jig with the Dread Captain DeMeza and she’ll be impressed enough to press you into her crew and outfit you properly. If you get attached to your new look, you can do the quest You're Gonna Need A Bigger Boat! (https://www.wowdb.com/quests/42758-youre-gonna-need-a-bigger-boat)! Succeed, and you’ll get an Emergency Pirate Outfit (https://www.wowdb.com/items/138414-emergency-pirate-outfit) (or five) for when Pirate’s Day is but a distant memory and your inner pirate is clawing to get out.<br />
<br />
What good is a pirate without an avian companion on their shoulder? Captain DeMeza (for the exchange of a few shiny coins) can help you call forth a temporary companion named Petey (https://www.wowdb.com/items/138400-petey) to take with you wherever you sail.<br />
<br />
From time to time the captain will shout for a brave party to take on a terror of the deeps–an elite shark known as Ol' Eary (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/108715-ol-eary). Make sure you have a hearty crew with you or you could become just so much chum in the waters of the bay.<br />
<br />
Join the Beach Party<br />
Once you and your crew have helped the captain handle Ol’Eary, you can celebrate with the crew at a little beach party just south of Booty Bay. The exalted among the Bloodsail Buccaneers can also purchase a toy from Edward Techt (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/122396-edward-techt)–the Jolly Roger (https://www.wowdb.com/items/150547-jolly-roger)-to show off their dedication to the cause.<br />

If you’re really feeling generous, you can also purchase a Big Bag of Booty (https://www.wowdb.com/items/116392-big-bag-of-booty) from Captain DeMeza and spread the wealth around to all your pirate pals in a burst of glittery glory.<br />
<br />

I just buy a token every month with wow gold, so I guess I'm out too. Oh well. I guess we can't expect to get everything in this game. That'd be insane to try. xD</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you buy 5 tokens and use them for $15 balance you can purchase a 6 month sub. that's what i did. it actually saves you because it only takes 5 tokens instead of 6 if you do month to month.</div></div><hr />

buy a bunch of bags for 300g each. party up with your toon from another server, and drop all the bags &gt; your other toon loots them for a 5% loss.<br />

Just like the last ditch effort of the Annual Pass in Cataclysm. As we all know, the game completely died out after that desperate attempt to retain subs.</div></div><hr />

Why? People are always asking for mounts as rewards for players who àre subscribed for a long time. Then they get one and it's pathetic? It's a reward for people who subscribe for 6 months. That's a nice reward.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
What is that even supposed to mean? I saw this exact sentiment thrown around during the Annual Pass as well...<br />
<br />
The annual pass was a very thinly veiled attempt at locking subscriber numbers when they knew there was going to be a loooooong stretch of dead time with no content happening. It was made available in October 2011, with Dragon Soul coming shortly after, and then absolutely nothing happening until Mists of Pandaria came out in September 2012. <br />
<br />
So if you bought the annual pass, you basically were roped into a year of Dragon Soul - almost none of the game time would have been left over by the time they finally released MoP. The big reason this gets a lot of flak is because Dragon Soul was widely regarded as one of(if not the) worst raids Blizzard ever released, especially for what was supposed to be the final tier of raiding that was intended to wrap up the expansion/Deathwing storyline - with lots of recycled content and frustrating boss mechanics(particularly spine), combined with almost a year of content drought following its release.<br />
<br />
This new pirate ship scheme is getting flak now because of the timing - people have been widely deriding Blizzard's design choices and lack of content in BfA so far, and along with Ion's whole &quot;grand scheme&quot; meme, it's just not a good look for them to be pulling this right now.</div></div><hr />

But this definitely proves Blizzard is losing subs. Pitiful.<br />
<br />
There was never a time in this game's history when they weren't bleeding subs on some level. Never more than 12 million retained, over 100 million accounts created. <br />
<br />
I remember the Annual pass back in Cataclysm being &quot;teh literal death of teh game!&quot; though, and yet here we are, the game still garnering the attention of millions with new content.<br />
<br />
Is it a cash grab? For sure, BUT, it's also an added incentive to people who otherwise sub for 6 months at a time. They can get a mount with it now too. Why make less money when you could make more?<br />
<br />
If it were the case that they were struggling, they'd be VERY careful to add things like this to the shop. Look at the end of WoD and the moose mount for reference.<br />
<br />
I for one will be getting it using gold conversion. Why spend real money when you can spend pixels? :3</div></div><hr />

I haven't yet seen mentioned one of the other big perks (for some of us) that came with the Annual Pass...... Diablo3.

There's a difference in the situation however. The content drought for Cata was backloaded, where the annual pass coincided with a year of absolutely nothing post-Dragon Soul.<br />
<br />
The content drought is front-loaded this expansion - the expectation is that we're going to have a dearth of content until whatever they're planning to implement finally shows up(see: &quot;grand scheme&quot; meme). This 6-month lock-in lines up perfectly with the idea that we're not doing to see 8.1 for several months at least.</div></div><hr />

Well, it's another testament to the delusions of the playerbase.<br />
The amount of players being even halfway done with everything that is available must be so small that it's insignificant. I shall laugh once we have the release date for 8.1 though, and it's nowhere near &quot;several months from now at least&quot;. <br />

You know the water strider was an accident? It was meant to just waterwalk in Pandaria, I doubt they'll make that mistake again lol. But hey I could be wrong, they did the same exact thing with Expulsom that they did with blood of sargeras for double gatherers at the start of Legion. Only this time you can't gather Expulsom so I guess technically it's different, technically they could just not scrap gear :)</div></div><hr />

Said so many people with the Tyrael's Charger as well.<br />
It never became a store mount in the West, so I wouldn't recommend that approach unless you simply don't want the mount. :)<br />

Edit: Seems they went a different approach with this one, so waiting is a valid approach! In fact, makes me consider if it's worth paying up-front when I can just get the mount standalone. :confused:<br />

Buyer beware.<br />
<br />
No, they sell 6 months of gametime with early access to a mount that's to become a store mount later on anyway. It's still very much the case that players either find the game worth paying for, or they don't and thus don't pay. Only on forums such as MMO-C does one see the kind of obsessive characters sticking around the game years on end without caring for it. <br />

<br />
and the sheep follow<br />
<br />
The point of the offer in Cataclysm was to entice people who might not usually play a Diablo title to tryDiablo, and players wouldn't have to choose between paying for WoW or paying for Diablo. In turn I'm sure they hoped to make that money back through the real money AH they had going at the time on D3. I don't think the offer had much to do with WoW at all.<br />

Because the mount hovers off the ground it appears to float on water - but at mount swimming speed. Still water strider ftw</div></div><hr />

I imagine it was deliberately intended to not be able to, because you'd effectively be paying real money for a mount that is functionally superior to most mounts.</div></div><hr />

It feels like a huge middle finger to the face. &quot;Haha, sucker, you bought game time slightly before we were going to make a good deal.

Not the first time they've done this, but I think it was near end of the expansion when subs typically drop off till the next one, but with a lot of the complaints about BfA not too surprised they're doing it this early.</div></div><hr />

It never became a store mount in the West, so I wouldn't recommend that approach unless you simply don't want the mount. :)<br />
<br />
Edit: Seems they went a different approach with this one, so waiting is a valid approach! In fact, makes me consider if it's worth paying up-front when I can just get the mount standalone. :confused:<br />
Not a very solid business decision. Guess they're not as desperate for subs as some would have us believe.<br />
<br />
Except if you if you buy 6mo of game time, you actually save money (about $25 vs month-to-month payments) AND get the mount for free. If you wait to buy it in the shop you are not only paying an extra $25 for your sub, but another $25 for the mount. You've now in essence paid $50 for the mount.</div></div><hr />

Step 1- Take a breath and calm down.<br />
Step 2- Go back and actually read the blue post, slowly, and pay really really close attention to the bottom bit where it specifically mentions that people who recently bought a 6-mo sub or those with a recurring 6-mo sub will get the mount automatically.</div></div><hr />

Why blizzard didnt just put their 10$ mount in the store? They need to come with some numbers at the end of the year otherwise they get fired , so they came with this financial engeenering. Also if you sub for the next 6 months what you will do? BFA is already finished! Warfronts fail, island adventure fail, azerite trait fail (Where are the god damn tier bonuses we had in legion and all previous expansions?) , 2 classes are 0 shadow priests and shaman. Raid content is (...) can't express in words. They actually nerfed the bosses so method can finish this raid garbage so they can head forward to deploy the next patch.

Oooooooor, I like the game, will be playing for the next six months anyway, so it's a free mount! Shocker huh, that there are actually people who like the game?<br />
<br />
It's not a scam btw. You get exactly what they say and it's not more expensive then six months was before.<br />

<br />
How so? You can buy the mount seperately at a later date. No one is forcing you to buy a 6-month subscription. The mount itself is not more &quot;superior&quot; to any other mounts since it's the same speed, and it can't walk on water.<br />
<br />
See this more as a reward for those that are actively subscribing 6-month subsctibtions already. It could be an incentive for those that are enjoying the game to start with 6-month subscription instead of subscribing month-to-month.</div></div><hr />

Yes, it's similar, but the condition for a promotion/offer does not have to be same. You can have promotion for a bunch of different reasons. There has been promotions before the Cata one (though Cata promotion was indeed the biggest Blizzard had done), but not all promotions has happened during a drought or during a downfall of the game.<br />
<br />
It's like saying &quot;X business has done this before, thus whenever X business does this again in the future it will be for the same reason!&quot;.<br />
I'm not saying that the subs for WoW are falling, but that does not mean that a promotion is done entirely because of that.<br />
<br />
As others has pointed out, Pirates Day had been datamined in July already, before the launch of BFA, so the promotion was most likely already planned back then as well. Or we can all have our tinfoil hats on and pretend that WoW is dying (it's been dying for years apparently but it still is alive somehow...) and this promotion happened to stumble perfectly on the official Pirates Day to miraculously save the game yet again!</div></div><hr />

He's talking out of his ass as usual. The promotion was datamined back in January 2018, and a blue confirmed that they'd been planning for this promotion for 8-9 months. <br />
<br />
He's literally just doing whatever he can to get view money, following the same pattern he's been following for a decade or some shit.<br />

<br />
No, it's not, no matter how much wishful thinking is applied. <br />
<br />
They were planning the release of this promotion 8-9 months back, fyi. It's a free mount for long-term subscribers, something that's been asked for years from players. Loyalty rewards, so to speak.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That does not mean anything. Just because they knew 8-9 months back (when the game was already 1-2 years in the works) that it ends up being crap (because really, in 8-9 months they can only add the final quests to it and then the bugfixing-control). People already complained at blizzcon about this crappy theme (an I really think that they were surprised how few people like the &quot;faction war&quot;-theme), and only after this they realized that this game might be the biggest failure of all expansions. (and strictly speaking: right now it's even worse than WoD was at this point,and i mean opening-patch where WoD had still many strengths like leveling-content and class design (compared to legion, class design was the best at MoP9).<br />
<br />
So after they have seen that this game is far worse than cata, they simply added a new promotion for it. Legion didn't need this kind of thing, but blizzard need it. And i personally doubt that this promotion was planned now, instead on the big upcoming content-drought.</div></div><hr />

You can think what you will, they've shared exactly what their plans were.<br />
<br />
And &quot;the game being crap&quot; = subjective.<br />
The game being &quot;worse than Cataclysm&quot; = stupid hyperbole at best. <br />
<br />
The biggest failure of all expansions from an OBJECTIVE point of view, is and forever will be WoD, unless they literally put one out that has LESS to it than that expansion. You people simply suffer from extremely short/selective memory.<br />
<br />
It's a store mount, which they added during Legion, offered up as a free-of-charge bonus to people that are long-term players, as in not fickle personalities jumping back and forth every month. Literally what the playerbase has been asking for for years and years. The blue said it, these things don't draw new subscribers, it merely serves to reward the players that would be subbed and playing anyway.<br />
<br />
Everyone else can buy the mount as a regular store option at a later date. <br />
<br />
But alas, people found a way to twist 12 million retained subscribers into doom, gloom and &quot;sky is falling!!!&quot;-narratives as well, so I guess some people can't be helped.</div></div><hr />

8-9 months to only add final quests and then bugfixing-control? Let me guess, you don't work with development?<br />
Only a few like the &quot;faction war&quot;-theme? Any sources on this or are you just blindly accepting some singular youtuber? Because from what I saw from people after the reveal trailer was that they actually looked forward to the classical faction war.<br />
BFA being bigger failure than WoD? What? Did you even play WoD? Did you even bother playing BFA? Also, class design was not the best at MoP, maybe it was for you, but I can assure you that many people will disagree with that statement.<br />
<br />
You sure throw out a lot of statements, care to back it up with some sources and facts? Or are these just &quot;your observation&quot; and therefor it must be true?</div></div><hr />
