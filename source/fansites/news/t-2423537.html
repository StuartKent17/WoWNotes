PvP Scaling Changes<br />
Level 110 -120 PvP Scaling<br />
We're preparing a hotfix to go live soon which will widen the power gap a bit between players between 110 to 120. This means that, for example, a 120 will be stronger against a 115 after the hotfix than they are on live today.<br />
<br />
Regarding lower level players being stronger at a lower level than they would be at max level, we haven't found that to be the case. (Though to be fair, that was regretfully the case in some situations in beta and on live because of bugs.)<br />
<br />
In the case of Venruki, we loaded both characters internally and tested the scenario (exact spell sequences, etc.) with his Druid opponent at max level with gear the same iLevel as his Mage. Venruki would still of lost in that scenario if the Druid was at the same level and iLevel as him, so it is not a scaling issue between players of different levels but perhaps something else (1v1 class balance, item choices, etc.).<br />
<br />
Actually, the PvP scaling changes are now live. We'll continue to monitor things and make changes where necessary. Thanks everyone.

<br />
PvP Scaling Below Level 110<br />
There is no scaling below 110<br />
<br />
Except... There is: https://clips.twitch.tv/TameWiseJaguarUWot<br />
This was a bug with the resilience stat scaling, which has been fixed. There is no scaling tech applied to player vs player combat under 110.

Developer Interview - Sylvanas isn't Another Garrosh<br />
PCGamesN (https://www.pcgamesn.com/world-of-warcraft/sylvanas-garrosh) has stated in a presentation at Gamescom, producer Michael Bybee has addressed the issue of people claiming that Sylvanas is Garrosh 2.0.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are no plans to repeat stories from previous expansions (as in Garrosh)<br />
There are other plans in store for both the Alliance and the Horde in terms of story.<br />
Sylvanas's burning of Teldrassil is just one part of a larger story that the team is planning to tell and has been planned out for a long time.<br />
The story of Battle for Azeroth is very long.<br />
The team is super excited about where the story is going to go and is not going to do to Sylvanas what was done to Garrosh.<br />
When Eurogamer asked (https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-08-22-telling-world-of-warcrafts-story-is-challenging-because-its-spread-across-more-than-the-game-blizzard-says) about Teldrassil growing back, Bybee said &quot;It is a magical tree, and it's not the first magical tree&quot;</div></div><hr />

Exact same idea. Did I tell you a woman wrote that story? This is pure damage control. <br />
I bet they are rewriting this trash right now. It was clear from the short video that Sylvanas destroyed the tree from an emotion spike. End of story. <br />
They will try to wash it with &quot;she was forced to do that (old gods, left over dreadlords)&quot; but NO. It was a pure reaction of her emotions. Everything before the shore cinematic implified she wanted to take over the tree and not destroy it...<br />
<br />
This is genocide and the punishment is death. So yeah this is another Garosh story but with more emotions. <br />
<br />
And if they have to force out a phatetic spin to save the girl like Sylvanas was not the real one at the shore... Well I will have to spit on their writers. Shame on you.<br />
Btw Sylvanas should have executed the orc at that shore before ths cinematic to failing her orders and committing high treason. &quot;Hi, I am Sylvanas and I don't see a bloody bag in your hands, orc. Where is Malf's head exactly? Because you know my idea is to put the head on a spike?I told you at the camp... Hey hero, yes, you. You were there, what has happend? Ohh so you are not telling me well another high treason. hang them!&quot;</div></div><hr />

Just because I'm able to let something play out before crying like a little bitch about it doesn't mean I enjoy it nor agree with every decision made.<br />

<br />
<br />
What an utterly incel thing to say. I had problems believing someone would actually say shit like that, thank you for opening my eyes.<br />
<br />
The problem here is a sperg ridden community who cannot control their emotions because of a story. While I agree that Sylvanas' Warbringers short made it seem as she did it on a whim, the collectors edition stories and in game interactions painted a better picture that was actually more cohesive. Instead of doing what most people do these days; instantly jump to conclusions, express your outrage on twitter and look for more shit to be angry about. Why don't you take a step back and try looking at the story from different perspective. Read all the materials, have patience, you're behaving like tabloid-reading halfwits who love a cheap thrill.<br />
<br />
I feel like her becoming another Garrosh was a slight concern to me even. I'm just glad we won't have to see this again. Hopefully.</div></div><hr />

Weird, I thought it was a sign of a toxic/crappy internet fanbase that can't wait to see how things go down and just piss on it now instead.<br />

<br />
<br />
You’re absolutely right on all levels, but this is an MMO after all and Blizzard always has to “play it safe”. They don’t want to sabotage their own company and lose players over such controversial story events, that’s why the story will always be cliche. <br />
<br />
So you’re right but realistically what you’re saying cannot and will not happen. And yes, they’re likely re-writing some parts but we’ll never know :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
it so pathetic that blizzard even has to come out time and time again because horde fangirls dont want to belive that their beloved sylvanas could actually be a psycho...<br />
<br />
yet nobody is talking about the night elves... all is about our little girl sylvy. probably will be like &quot;sylvanas does stupid thing which is justified with &quot;uh it stoped the bad guys&quot;&quot; and alliance will be like &quot;dont do that again!&quot; kind of parent to cool daughter dynamic. <br />
<br />
i cant wait to see the redemption story for her...<br />
<br />
i said from the beginning that they will never make their postergirl become a 2nd garrosh.<br />

she will be the leader of all of azeroth even alliance will kiss her feet.</div></div><hr />

its because ferals have a big streamer and his following behind them right now. ofc they will do something about that because 1 streamer can sway the perception about the game really fast... everything is about public relations.</div></div><hr />

That is quite common in story telling actually. And there are MANY stories inside the current content that are interesting and could lead to fun and interesting things. Like any good fantasy, I have my theories based on reading/playing chapter 1 and I'm now waiting on chapter 2 and beyond to see how all unfolds. I don't think Blizzard has to defend anything, its just fine. Chapter 1 (and often well beyond) are always setups and character introductions for the action that will occur later.</div></div><hr />

Right? If anything the story will end up being worse than garrosh one. He got developed during 3 xpacs to become the enemy. Sylvanas just said screw it and burned a tree city with all citizens inside for the thrill of it. I think not even Garrosh would do crap like that.</div></div><hr />

Well, perhaps keep an open mind for the rest of the story. If you don't like it, fair enough, likes and dislikes are all subjective anyway, but if you are displeased with how BfA starts, and are expecting the rest of the story to continue displeasing you, you might find it all a little self-fulfilling.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I've read tons of books that started 'badly' and got better over time, or got off to a great start but dwindled afterwards. It's all a matter of expectation I guess.<br />
<br />
With stuff like WoW, I don't expect to be that impressed with the storytelling. If there are elements I like (like Sylvanas nuking Teldrassil, probably cause it's a bit controversial), then great. If not, well I wasn't expecting anything special anyway.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, its super hard to read the books. They are often awful and poorly written. I think its rather unlikely players read those. Even diehard lore fans have issues with them. The main info should be avaliable in the main media. No one should have to buy and read a shitty book to understand the game.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, these feral &quot;buffs&quot; are just a slap in the face, bringing feral AoE up from &quot;dead last&quot; to &quot;still dead last but ~3% better, yay!&quot; It continues to perform almost equally poorly on single target and suffer from severe resource starvation while having one of the most difficult (and some would say annoying) single-target rotations to pull off.<br />
<br />
Pray that between now and 8.1, Blizzard spends the time to figure out what needs to be changed with shamans, and makes well thought-out and meaningful changes. The &quot;so fast&quot; buffs to Feral fixed literally nothing, were completely out of touch with how the spec plays, and will probably be all the changes it sees between now and 8.3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This is a faulty and misguided statement.<br />
<br />
I have had a hard time getting people to understand the difference, but its not the direction of the boook, its how the book was written. It was just poor writing.<br />
<br />
I'm am not criticizing WoW because the story got me worked up. Good stories are supposed to do that. <br />
<br />
But the story didn't get me worked up because its armature story telling. I don't mind the major events that happened. Stuff like that mixes things up and generates content and while I can get engaged and even like the events that are unfolding, the way its being told has been lackluster.<br />
<br />
Its not a problem of waiting to see where the story is going. Its a problem of poor presentation that is happening right now.<br />
<br />
People are arguing two different things and aren't connecting in the slightest as to what the issue is.<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally, I am fine with what happened to the world tree. I don't mind losing the Undercity. I don't mind the faction war, who appears to be winning or losing, and I look forward to the content coming up because while I think Blizzard lacks in storytelling, they have made a incredibly complex and interesting world.<br />
<br />
But to reitterate; Its not the story direction. I have plenty of patience. Its the fact that storyline is inconsistent with character behavior. Some characters are incredibly flat and 1 dimensional. Just about everything Blizzard is doing is either predictable and non-engaging or so far out in left field it just doesn't make sense.<br />
<br />
They could have had all the same story arcs, and events, but had just presented it better and you wouldn't have heard people complaining.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
All said and done though, at the end of the day, there are tons of things outside of the story in WoW to still enjoy and while I wish Blizzard hired better talent for for the over all story arc (I actually have enjoyed the individual zone stories well enough), there is still plenty of enjoyment for me to get out of the game. The story is just sort of a let down IMO. <br />
<br />
Honestly what bugs me more is that the argument is so disjointed. Blizzard and Blizzard defenders refuse to hear the other side and just say &quot;wait! we're not there yet children!&quot; while the other side thats discontent are insisting &quot;but your misunderstanding. Please, just listen. Its not the story line or events that are the problem, its the quality of story telling.&quot;<br />
<br />
Its not to 100% distract us with exciting, yet pointless graphical eye candy just to gloss over that the story has had no effort put into it. Its like the outline of the story was created, and Blizzard figured they didn't really need to go much past that.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Totally. The LotR is a good example of stories that start shakily - or where overall consistency/quality is a bit sketchy, I still find a lot of Two Towers a grinding slog - but worth persevering with.<br />
<br />
I like how you state The LotR is a story where consistency and quality are a bit sketchy, yet you defend Blizzard with 'wait and see'.<br />
<br />
This is clear evidence you are mixing two concepts up. The LotR story is slow and a slog at time. But the writing is professional and consistent all the way through. The quality of writing is fine, there's just parts of the books that are less exciting or engaging. Not because of quality, but because of content.<br />
<br />
WoW, arguably being a game, can't be held to the same standards, but to make the point, suffers from the exact opposite of what you are connecting.<br />
<br />
WoW suffers from poor quality, not content. I am looking forward to future content because Blizzard has always been good about that. Story telling quality though is in the dumps (kind of beating a dead horse though because their over-all main arc story telling has always been pretty poor). Theres just to much thats been bastardized, cut down/or out, rewritten and ret-conned, for it to be really any good. I would hope Blizzard could do better, but maybe they cant just because the fact that its a game and told in a different way then a book or movie. But its still pretty bland, poorly presented, and not really engaging. To many elements are at odds for someone that thinks about the story-line to really be drawn in.<br />
<br />
There is a clear difference between someone becoming emotional about the story line and where its going and between someone thats become emotional about poor story telling and a lackluster presentation. Many people are mixing up the first for the second.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, but no. No matter what people pretend LotR is a drawn out snoozefest from start to finish. It may be a classic fantasy epic but it wastes hundreds of pages and several chapters on people saying their farewells after the bloody ring got destroyed.

That's... a weird take. Granted, I haven't read it, so please take my opinion with a grain of salt, but I thought a bit part of the post-Mordor was The Scouring of the Shire (http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Scouring_of_the_Shire), aka the Battle of Bywater. Yes, there were a number of goodbyes leading up to it, but Merry and Pippin taking the lead in removing the orcs from the shire once and for all was supposed to be something of a big deal (which makes the exclusion from the movie notable). It's meant to show how these two Hobbits have gone from meek and passive to heroes in their own right.<br />
<br />
I can easily see LotR being a taxing read, and it certainly does an IMMENSE amount of world-building - to the point of exposition dumping! - but it's generally richer for it from the bits I have read.</div></div><hr />

Ignore him. He clearly doesn't like fantasy, or reading... One of the two or both.<br />
<br />
The book has slow points but its clear that he skips over detail and has no care for anything outside of the main story arc.<br />
<br />
It's one thing to not like Tolkien's books because you don't like fantasy or there wasn't enough gripping writing for him to get engaged from one drawn out scene to another. But popular opinion is pretty clearly different from his on these stories. The movies made a huge impact and the books were far better then the movies.<br />

Well, not really. I think you might have taken my post a little out of context sorry, and then proceeded to make a few assumptions about what I was getting at?<br />
<br />
The OP was talking about the story being bad (amongst other things). The story being bad is ultimately what I was posting about, not quality of writing, just to be clear. <br />
<br />
If you think the quality of the writing in BfA (or with Blizzard in general) is bad, then happy days, I don't think it's exceptional myself either - all very subjective really - but again I was talking about the story (potentially) getting better over time, regardless of the quality of writing.<br />
<br />
Also, I'm not sure you can reasonable conflate your opinion to be true for everyone else. I'm sure some players just don't like the direction of the story?<br />
<br />
Anyway, some stories can be great but not particularly well written. If you think LotR is well written, for example, that's your welcome opinion, but in my opinion I don't think Tolkien was a particularly great writer - I think he was an incredibly creative synthesist and visionary - however I love the story of LotR regardless.<br />
<br />
I was only referencing LotR in the context of a story that (imo), doesn't start well, but gets better as it goes along.<br />

Which still does nothing to disprove my original point that the book doesn't &quot;get better&quot;. The problems it has at the beginning - doing the world building in huge drawn out chunks - are still present at the end.<br />
<br />
It's not even a matter of wether you like this style of writing a lot. I mean I'm pretty sure none of the books I like have universal appeal. You can totally judge the writing from the first few chapters because it will not change.</div></div><hr />

Haha, I can see why you'd write that, but there were a lot of loose ends to tie up (!) and personally I loved all the nerdy stuff about the history of the world Tolkien created, helped with the verisimilitude.<br />
<br />
I'm not the biggest fan of Hobbits and their lifestyle however, so for me it was start of the books that I struggled with. As soon as the mood changed when Gandalf collared Frodo, discussed the significance of his funny magic ring, and the Dark Riders/Nazgul rocked up - I was hooked.</div></div><hr />

I did state that it was 'IMO' and I wasn't putting that on anyone else. After all, I clearly stated that the story 'in my opinion' was lackluster and I think the poster you were referring to was talking about quality as well, not content, but maybe I misunderstood. I have seen many people talk about quality and then be mistaken for complaining about content.<br />
<br />
I may have over-stated, or have poorly written my statement about people not agreeing on what the actual argument is about (if that's what you are referring to) and you are correct, I should have stated it differently, as I am sure some people are just upset with story direction and in that case, Blizzard's and everyone else stating 'wait and see' are actually responding with a valid statement.<br />
<br />
However, stating it more clearly: I have seen many people criticize Blizzards ability to tell the story and often get shuffled off and dismissed as 'just not liking the story'. Blizzard did this very thing themselves and actually used it as a shield to ignore the valid criticism.

<br />
<br />
I do completely disagree with you however on not being able to factually point out good writers from bad. Story content is objective and opinion. That said, good story telling/writing is not. Its an art form that's been developed over the course of human history and it, without a doubt, has many accepted rules that together make a good story, from character creation and development, world building, logical event progression and much much more. I am admittedly no professional writer, but I do love to write and I have taken many college courses on the subject. Blizzard clearly follows hardly any good story telling fundamentals. Tolkein however does includes many standard story telling fundamentals in his books (hell, some were even derived from his writing). He practices good story telling standards. Blizzard is unaware of the simple fundamentals of story telling. Tolkein's ability to write however, weather you liked it or not, is clearly better then your typical author. Not only does he include good writing habits, but his books wouldn't be what they are now if it was otherwise (and yes, while the movies added to their popularity, the story was already widely enjoyed by many long before that.<br />
<br />
Its not like you read a tabloid and anyone could argue that its good writing and you thinking its bad is just an opinion. Its terrible writing and the people that actually enjoy it just enjoy low quality writing. We do have standards that good writing is held up to.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*edit* The original post from familiar was &quot;When you frantically have to explain that your storyline won't be as bad as in previous years, and people have to be patient because the story will get better - then this is probably a sign that something's not quite right with your storytelling&quot;.<br />
<br />
He was clearly talking about storytelling being covered up by the excuse of storyline. I think you misunderstood him and this isn't a case of me misunderstanding you.</div></div><hr />

I absolutely agree that it's fair to be critical of Blizzard's ability to tell a story, for sure.<br />
<br />
I didn't mean to suggest that Tolkien wasn't a good writer either, I think he was, just a personal opinion that he wasn't 'great' - and I realise I'm not looking objectively at him - but that's only my opinion based on the pacing of LotR, for example, and it's been a while since I read it. Probably time I picked it up again.<br />
<br />
Plus it's late and I no longer know how much sense I'm making! And that will be a factor in how I interpreted your post too haha. Need a buff to my intellect at this time of day!</div></div><hr />

All good and sorry if I appeared to be getting to caught up in the discussion. It just has been discouraging when making a criticism for the criticism to be mislabeled and dismissed, which, I don't think you were doing actually and I probably jumped the gun.<br />
<br />
And on the subject of Tolkien, I didn't mean to sound so avid in defending him. I know many people that don't like his books and I will certainly agree with you on his pacing with content. He tries give an exorbitant amount of details in his settings and this easily looses a lot of reader's attention. I think this walks a fine line of opinion on content and ability to actually tell a story. Many people struggle with the pacing and excessive detail (although much of it is very important to the story and world he is depicting). Its kind of the hole he dug for himself in the fact that he wanted to present stories of a complete fictional universe vs. what many authors do of just depicting the story and its' setting.<br />
<br />
Anyways, getting off topic here and I agree with you. Tolkien isn't one of my favorite authors, and I have criticism of his works as well, but its clear he is a good author, unlike how the other poster was claiming and in the end, I think its funny that he was brought up as a comparison to WoW in the fact that Blizzard can't even compete in that department. But.... different media as well. Despite my criticisms of Blizzard, I give them a lot of leeway and as stated earlier, there is plenty to enjoy in the game, hell even story line wise, outside of the main story arc that I believe is just a cluster of trying to smash events together and attempt to generate content without storytelling quality really being involved.</div></div><hr />

The problems it has at the beginning - doing the world building in huge drawn out chunks - are still present at the end.<br />
<br />
It's not even a matter of wether you like this style of writing a lot. I mean I'm pretty sure none of the books I like have universal appeal. You can totally judge the writing from the first few chapters because it will not change.<br />
<br />
Unpopular opinion, but I agree with you. The only part of that entire story I like is the Shire and the hobbits. That was some great world-building, and I would read an entire book just on that. Nearly everything else, from the elves to the orcs to the humans was borderline tedious.</div></div><hr />

As soon as the mood changed when Gandalf collared Frodo, discussed the significance of his funny magic ring, and the Dark Riders/Nazgul rocked up - I was hooked.<br />
<br />
Which was still the beginning if you think about it. The main plot (go and destroy the ring) does not kick in till they reach Rivendel. Everything else is essentially the prologue.<br />
<br />
Generally in classic stories everything is nice and slow and idyllic till shit hits the fan. But that can't apply to BfA as shit already hit the fan. Sylvanas already destroyed two capital cities. In fact we have been playing a continuous story since MoP began.<br />

<br />
The biggest difference for me was how world building was mostly done by Gandalf in character. You know like when he explained the history of the ring to Frodo. Because neither him nor the audience knew. But it was kinda important to the plot so it was told. Later on this shifted to: the narrator gonna dump five pages of history for you right here. Which is very impressive in terms of world building, but less impressive in terms of story telling.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What I like about you two here is that you prefer opposite parts of the story. That is why you can't really make claims that a story &quot;gets better&quot;. People prefer different stuff in their story. It might get better for you or it might get worse. The only thing you can be sure is that the writing style won't change. If you like it, awesome. It might carry a bad story for you (Murakami's every novel). If not, tough luck.<br />
<br />
For BfA everything is bad so far. A few genuine plot twists won't save it.</div></div><hr />

No worries here, it's good to read/listen to other people's opinions and get a different perspective on things. Haha, I think Gandalf actually says something like 'even the wise can't see all ends' (not sure if I am remembering the film or book there!). I try not to be so certain of my own take on things, and it's always good to be challenged.<br />
<br />
Yes, Tolkien had so much to tell, and it's incredible how expansive and complete his work is, especially when including stuff like the Silmarillion. I think I would take him telling 'too much', and think overall it was worth it - he literally tried to create an alternate mythology (as far as I am aware), and it's epic.<br />
<br />
And true, Blizzard can't really compete with LotR. I think you mentioned about perhaps being a game limitation? I would agree. I know that there are games out there that do have good writing and storytelling, but most seem not to, and I guess Blizzard are guilty of needing to do better too in many ways.<br />

Hadn't thought of it like that, since the proverbial has already hit the fan in BfA, does it escalate from here? Rivers of blood and mountains of corpses it is then from here on out! Hopefully on the Alliance side :p<br />
<br />
Fair enough, but in terms of likes and dislikes, it's all subjective anyway as you say, so I can claim LotR gets better as it goes along, because it does for me, but I accept it might not do so for others. But then I was talking about the overall story itself - and perhaps should have clarified that - not the quality of writing. I was applying the same thought process to BfA (but for me, I like how it has 'started', but hey, maybe it all goes downhill from here).</div></div><hr />

I never read anything stupid like this on the internet before. You really made my day. The start in Lord of the Rings is necessary to understand the world, the background of characters and races. It's the key to understand all what is happening. That's the part of the book which WoW handles over the game normally. There is no reason to tell players what Forsaken are and why they are undead, you start a Forsaken character and get this information over quests. In normal literature you need to write stuff like that to give the reader the chance to see this world and the characters in his mind.<br />
<br />
There are very few fantasy books that have such a detailed description of the world and the characters in it like Lord of the Rings. If you can't understand basics of storytelling you should really stop arguing on the internet.<br />
Based on your view &quot;Cannery Row by Steinbeck&quot; would be a piece of trash literature like Fifty Shades of Grey.</div></div><hr />

At least some. Granted we all have different tastes but I personally enjoyed the Darth Bane trilogy a lot. And then there is Vector Prime. Sure it gets a lot of bad rep for killing Chewie, but it was not the same old formula with the evil Empire. I liked it. Not all SW books are Karen Traviss levels of garbage.<br />

So if someone can't stand the writing style of Tolkien they can't understand the basics of storytelling? Well maybe the only reason why you can't find stupid stuff on the internet is because you don't read your own posts. Which would explain a lot.</div></div><hr />

Christ, you must not have much read much internet then hehe. I'm glad that I brightened your day.<br />
<br />
When it comes to the start of LotR, and how it covers Bilbo's birthday and so on, please explain how this helps the reader understand the world of Middle-Earth, the background of all the characters presented in the story, and all the races contained within too? Fairly certain that Tolkien does this as he goes along with the story, but it's been a while. Also I'd argue that there is much Tolkien wrote outside of the main story of LotR (Hobbit, Silmarillion, Appendices etc) that are key to really understanding what is going on, but that's probably a separate (and possibly) moot point.<br />
<br />
Like I said elsewhere, as soon as Gandalf rocks up, Dark Riders get involved etc, and the tone shifts from what is effectively light-hearted - a la The Hobbit - into something much more moody (personal opinion here), I much prefer how things proceed. But anyway...<br />
