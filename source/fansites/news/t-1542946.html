Warlords of Draenor - Heirloom Tab Delayed<br />
Rygarius let us know (https://twitter.com/Rygarius/status/480048337266425856) that the heirloom tab won't make it for the launch of Patch 6.0.1.<br />

Garrison Building Specializations Changed<br />
It looks like the building specializations (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3910-WoD-Beta-Invites-at-PAX-Garrisons-Blue-Tweets-PAX-Updates-OpenRaid-CM-Runs#buildingspec) mentioned in the Garrison Preview blog post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4029-Garrison-Preview-Part-1-Your-Base-on-Draenor) will now be part of the building perks.<br />

New Character Model Facial Variation<br />
Bashiok reminded everyone (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/322380-new-character-models-faces-look-all-the-same/) that the current single face geometry will be explained in an upcoming Artcraft.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/june/thumb/sameFaceForNow.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/june/sameFaceForNow.jpg) <br />
<br />
<br />
I replied to a similar thread not too long ago, but yes there is effectively a single face geometry available in alpha with multiple texture options. We are in the midst of working on an Artcraft that'll go into the current process, so I'll just say stay tuned!<br />
<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor - Faction Hubs<br />
Currently there is a work in progress version of the faction hubs outside of Ashran. Lore mentioned (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/482702661683134466) that the current version is very much not final.<br />

Warlords of Draenor - Faction Hubs and Ashran<br />
Several of the developers shared some thoughts on the move of the faction hubs from Shadowmoon Valley and Frostfire Ridge to outside of Ashran.<br />
If we can't change our minds about ideas early in development once we've talked about them, we just won't talk about them. (Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/482633884052357120))<br />
<br />
Final Q to leave you with: which was the best capital? Shatt/Dal/SW+Org/Vale? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/482425731260362752))<br />
<br />
Stop focussing your replies to PVP complaints. It's about being promised an epic new city and instead getting Honor Hold 2<br />
As I mentioned in the thread, Bladespire and Karabor still very much exist. They're just not where the portal to Org/SW is. (Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/482645341297057793))<br />
<br />
Seeing some expectations that the explorable areas of Karabor will be the size of the Black Temple raid. That's not the case, and wouldn't have been even if it was the faction capital. (Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/482694496321142784))<br />
<br />
So are the capitols going to be like MoP where we don't get to them till late in questing? Or can we get there early without help?<br />
Current plan is that a flight path will be available from your Garrison once you establish it. (Mumper (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/482735991397298176))<br />
<br />
Ashran cities post mentioned &quot;only land-based entrance (to the city) is through world PvP zone.&quot; So you must enter PvP to get there?<br />

So an island in the water is not ok, but an island in the sky is? Weird. (Bashiok (https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/482654374062063616))<br />
<br />
Okay, there’s a LOT of misunderstandings and misinformation floating around, so let me try to clarify what I can.<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor’s story is about the people of Azeroth (namely, the Alliance and the Horde) venturing into an unknown world and building up a force strong enough to take out an enemy stronger than anything they’ve encountered before, on that enemy’s own turf. While there are certainly some alliances to be made along the way, and those are definitely major parts of the story, the core theme is about you and your faction fighting for survival.<br />
<br />
So, as development continued, we came to the realization that it just doesn’t make sense for the Horde and Alliance to spend so much energy and resources building up a stronghold on Draenor, only to base their efforts out of someone else’s city. We’re not helping the Draenei or Frostwolves fight off the Iron Horde – they’re helping us. The Alliance and Horde both have major bases of operation on Draenor. That should be where they’re working from.<br />
<br />
That, along with the continued development of Garrisons into the overall quest and story flow of the expansion, led us to the decision to develop the Horde and Alliance bases on Ashran into the major faction hubs instead of Bladespire and Karabor. Promoting the world PvP area on Ashran is a nice perk, but it wasn’t a factor in making that decision.<br />
<br />
That said, the Temple of Karabor and Bladespire Fortress are still there. We haven’t removed them or anything like that. You won’t be able to use your bank or check your auctions there, but they’re still fully built home cities for the Karabor Draenei and Frostwolf Orcs, respectively. You’ll still be able to explore them in their full glory.<br />
<br />
As to the Alliance and Horde staging areas on Ashran, allow me to lay out a few key facts to hopefully allay some concerns:<br />
<br />
They’re located on Ashran as a geographical location on the map, but they’re not part of the Ashran world PvP zone. They won’t be subjected to the realm coalescing we’re using to keep Ashran’s PvP area populated, and they won’t flag you for PvP on non-PvP realms. We’ve also made some major improvements to the way PvP flagging works on non-PvP realms that removes “accidental flagging” from mistargeted abilities or ground effects. Unless you manually flag yourself by typing /pvp, you will simply not be able to attack enemy players, or heal friendly players who have flagged themselves. They’re populated with guards, and the only land-based entrance is directly through the Ashran world PvP zone (including a major fortress). It’s certainly possible for someone from another faction to attack it, but it’s not any easier to do so than it is to attack the enemy faction’s shrine in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. There will be a fast travel option between the staging areas and your Garrison. You can pop over there quickly, conduct your business, and leave again if you like.<br />
<br />
This isn’t a question of whether or not Bladespire and Karabor are cities. They are. It’s just a question of whether the portals to Orgrimmar or Stormwind are there or somewhere else. You’ll still be able to explore them, they’ll still be fully populated, and they’re still going to be every bit as beautiful as they would have been with a Transmog NPC. We’re looking forward to them ourselves!<br />

Warlords of Draenor Beta Blue Posts<br />
Warlords of Draenor Moves Into Beta!<br />
Thanks in no small part to your testing and feedback, the Warlords of Draenor expansion is ready to officially shed the Alpha label and move on to the Beta testing phase! <br />
<br />
Our next step is a huge stress test on the Assault on the Dark Portal intro experience we opened up on Wednesday. We’re inviting a TON of players to the Beta, but we’ve temporarily restricted access to Draenor for now. We’ve also wiped characters from the Alpha, so you’ll need to create a new one, or copy your character over from live realms*.<br />
<br />
Today at 2 p.m. Pacific, we’ll respawn the NPCs that teleport you to Draenor (Archmage Khadgar, located in the Trade District in Stormwind or the Valley of Strength in Orgrimmar). We’d like to get as many people as possible logging in and trying out Tanaan to stress test the environment and make sure everything works. If you have a chance to jump in, please join us!<br />
<br />
We're testing our new in-game Character Copy feature, which is available for players with NA accounts only at this time. Players with EU accounts will need to create template characters for the time being in order to access Draenor.<br />
<br />
The launch of beta is the best chance we have to slam the servers with as many people as possible, because a huge wave of invites have gone out and everyone should know the start time. After today it's not as likely that we'll get this quantity of people trying to test the same areas at the same time. And that's the point. If it's an inconvenience to you to worry about whether or not the realms will handle the load, I'd only offer a reminder that this is a beta test.<br />
<br />
I totally understand, and even though it is inconvenient, I understand it is your reserved right as a company testing their game but you don't feel this would have been better down the line when things are actually worth slamming? <br />
<br />
We waited a full week for this build, and I DCed at least 10 times just yesterday before the &quot;stress.&quot; <br />
Just seems like build 2 of a public test isn't the time for this, but hey I'm along for the ride, so I am happy enough.<br />
<br />
It does seem like the servers going offline every 10 seconds has stopped, which is great news.<br />
Firstly, it's not build 2. We've gone through many alpha builds by this point, including prior to inviting non-Blizzard employees. Also, there will be additional stress tests on new content as it's added to the beta, but as I said this is our best opportunity to push everyone into the Tanaan intro experience. We've invited far more people to the beta than were in alpha, characters have been wiped so everyone is starting in the same place, 2 p.m. is the official launch of the beta, and so on.

Warlords of Draenor Beta and Addons<br />
As others have said, addons complicate the testing process early on. They can really interfere with bug reports and crash logs. We'll let players know when we're enabling addons, which is likely to be around the time that we're ready to do raid testing.

Nope. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/479437581382201344))<br />
Many players would disagree. Especially DKs who have grown very attached to their established playstyle-feel.<br />

<br />
What's with stat attunements? Doesn't making one stat &quot;better&quot; eliminate choice? People always choose to play optimally if the performance gap is significant.<br />
Not at all. Stats are tuned around the existence of these. Different stats are still totally viable; this doesn't change that. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/479446297296904193))<br />

I feel like you're trading ability bloat for tooltip bloat. Super long tooltips are just as bad imo.<br />

So, we're intended to use Seraphim every time it's up? I feel it's questionable to use it w/out Holy Avenger.<br />

&quot;Devouring Plague now always costs 3 Shadow Orbs.&quot; What is the point of shadow orbs again? Just put DP on a CD.<br />
That'd be significantly different. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/479442376688009216))<br />
It would be the superior method. You try so hard to make shadow orbs work but they offer no real advantage over just a CD.<br />
Hyperbole gets you nowhere. It *obviously* offers significant real advantage. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/479444400888504320))<br />
You could just slap a longer cd on plague then reduce it through haste or MB casts or apparitions or w/e. Objectively superior.<br />
I think you have a different concept of &quot;objectively&quot; than I do, and also ignored what I just said. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/479446775783124992))<br />

Also being able to spam big heals while oom seems very counter-intuitive<br />
There's a very big HPS difference between spamming Healing Surge and Healing Wave. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/478781733114880001))<br />
I am just very doubtful how mana management would ever work if no-one can ever go OOM<br />
What does &quot;going OOM&quot; mean to you on live? You can still spam Healing Wave, Earth Shield, Riptide, etc. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/478786415887540224))<br />
&quot;Going OOM&quot; really just means being unable to cast your more inefficient heals. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/478786769467346944))<br />
Which in warlords I can spam small heals while oom and my mana would go up. In previous case I can't spam nor gain mana<br />
Correct; it's different. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/478789114213310464))<br />
I'm just worried about situation &quot;spam X &gt; burst &gt; burn mana &gt; spam X for N seconds &gt; burst&gt; repeat situation (boring)<br />
&quot;X&quot; being a complex combination of half a dozen heals? That's not boring, that's gameplay. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/478790864601243648))<br />
I was referring to baseline efficient heal (due to twitter limits)<br />
Then not using your other half dozen heals would be extremely bad. They're some of your most efficient. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/478792440866807809))<br />
Here's a key distinction that may help understand: There are no more big vs small cast time heals. They're fast vs slow. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/478793774764552192))<br />

all of this ability removal and still no combination of Battle+Commanding Shout? Why not?<br />
It's actually a benefit; it's added flexibility. Many DPS bring 2 buffs, you bring Versatility + (Stamina or Attack Power). (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/479433750472695810))<br />

Re: Arms... How do we generate rage now? Charge/auto attack/crits only?<br />
Correct. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/479434387117715456))<br />
No Rend, no Slam, no Thunderclap. Is Arms now just MS, CS, Execute, and Sweeping Strikes?<br />
And Whirlwind. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/479436625361911808))<br />
<br />
Hint to arms' rotation on your end? All I see is MS &gt; CS &gt; T4 talent &gt; nothing. WW in ST like 5.0 fury did before WS buffed?<br />
Yes, WW as a filler. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/479441033059504128))<br />
Is WW free now or something? If it costs any rage, we won't touch it as a filler.<br />
Why not...? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/479442031811383296))<br />
Why would I use rage on WW if I need my rage for MS and CS which both hit much harder?<br />
Because you've got more Rage than you can spend on just MS and CS. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/479442670331240449))<br />
So MS still has a six second CD, and Colossus smash still has a 20 second CD?<br />
Correct. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/479444773489487872))<br />
And that CS CD is fixed with no Sudden Death to refresh it?<br />
Correct. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/479445952520921090))<br />

Not to mention I have no idea how rage generation is getting that high when the only change is increased rage from crits<br />

Regardless what he says, Lore seems to miss the REALLY BIG problem by not having Bladespire/Karabor as main cities. After having completed entire zone, what' would be the point of returning back to it? Without a further function, unless you+'re a Role Player), both places will become ghost towns just like Gilneas.<br />

<br />
Lore: &quot; So, as development continued, we came to the realization that it just doesn’t make sense for the Horde and Alliance to spend so much energy and resources building up a stronghold on Draenor, only to base their efforts out of someone else’s city. We’re not helping the Draenei or Frostwolves fight off the Iron Horde – they’re helping us. The Alliance and Horde both have major bases of operation on Draenor. That should be where they’re working from.&quot;<br />
<br />
So, wouldn't it make more sense to base out your operations on an already established GIANT fortress and use the resources you would have used to build a new rinky dink base elsewhere? I mean, economics 101. All those trees and stones used for both new hubs could be used to make other outposts on the mainland to choke out the iron horde even more, but noooo, gotta make up some gobbledy gook to try and sell an idea.</div></div><hr />

Its his &quot;job&quot; now tho :/.<br />
<br />
I agree, they need to stop replying to the PVP aspect of the new faction hub idea; they have already posted a lengthy reply on details of how it works and if people can not see PVP is completely removed from that aspect; not forced at all that's their own retarded fault. Especially with the new flag feature and well the fact that they are are not actually &quot;IN&quot; the Pvp area.<br />
<br />
I am SICK of Blizz Devs tho that always try to cram their retarded logic into excuses as dumb answers. <br />
Like the reply to why Hearth can not just be made a spell now... Its basically even tho the majority think its needed and obvious (and WE pay them) they say tuff blank, slap us in the face and walk away because they know we always come back.<br />
<br />
THIS takes the cake tho, these new hubs are crappppppp~. They are the equivalent of Dominance Offensive in MoP and making them our new HQs... (Actually that looks better then even this T_T.)<br />
They look awful and this is just a crime to any BC player... I'm an ally myself and felt like Horde were kinda screwed over compared to what we had... I even hoped maybe they could make the Naaru show up mid xpack or later shielding the area of Shatt that survived in the new raid area bringing us back to Shat. <br />
But this is worse then anything.. Even worse then the Horde city. (Sry I know some horde were fine with their location.)<br />
Now they rub it in like well you can still go VISIT it. LOL... Knowing tha'ts like tossing salt in an open wound when they give that BS reply.<br />
So one of our most best memories of BC is just eye candy that sits there useless because they change plans last min...<br />
I am sure many were very hopeful; I mean were talking BC/BT vibes here and they just crush it at last moment for many. Visiting it is not the same.. Just as much as I'm sure many wish we could go back to a newer Shat (being invaded or not; they were never pushed out; that section of Shat was shielded.)<br />
This is just fail; and on top of the fact we had ANOTHER team up with horde and Volj being a good guy and Varian snapping out of it also; were just suddenly back to slaughtering each other while supposedly fighting the greatest threat yet again... This is just GETTING OLD.<br />
<br />
This decision is just horrible; one of the worst yet...</div></div><hr />

While there are certainly some alliances to be made along the way, and those are definitely major parts of the story, the core theme is about you and your faction fighting for survival.&quot;<br />
<br />
It makes it really seem as though the Draenei (and I guess the Frostwolves) will be just a small part of the story. I don't see many Draenei heroes popping up after Shadowmoon aside from Maraad and Yrel. And if it's the Alliance and not the Draenei who are the focus, you can bet your bottom dollar that it'l be humans, humans, humans.</div></div><hr />

Who really cares where your capital city is? Do you spend all of your time sitting in said city doing nothing? If so, then you need to realize there are other things to do in this game. The raids look sweet and the dungeons look challenging and pretty awesome as well. There will be stuff to do, and if you don't like it, your single sub won't be missed. People keep threatening that they will unsub over freaking capital cities. That is the most absurd thing I've ever heard. I wanted Karabor to be my faction hub just as much as the next person, but it's not THAT big of a deal where I go to click on a portal and be on my way.<br />

Wait... what!? Are they forgetting something? Wasn't that the whole fucking point of building a Garrison? As a base of operation that we can work from? So spending &quot;so much energy and resources building up a stronghold on Draenor, only to base their efforts out of someone else’s city&quot; didn't make sense, but splitting the energy and resources into building 2 fucking strongholds makes perfect sense. I was under the assumption the reason why those cities were originally our main faction hubs were because they were sheltering us while we build a Garrison.

Thank you, this needed to be said. On top of it, it seems that most MMO-Champ posters are just angry and unhappy, and something will ALWAYS be wrong with whatever Blizz is doing. It's still beta...this stuff ISN'T set in stone yet, changes and tweaks are still being made.<br />

I'd rather go back to the days where they keep everything from us and launch things as surprises. That way the QQing will at least have something valid about it...sometimes...maybe.<br />
<br />
Also, guys, if you hate the change to your toons faces THAT much, you have the option to still use the old models. They aren't perma-gone with the new models loaded. Since I don't spend the game with my screen spun so my toon runs AT ME, i rarely see the face unless I'm on the character screen itself.<br />

And that is a good thing. Playerbase may know things developers do not, their feedback (ESPECIALLY the not official feedback) can help the creators see through the eyes of their customers. Parts of our favourite game are being &quot;under construction&quot;, but look bad in our eyes? Ranting about it may actually help both the playerbase and Blizzard.<br />
<br />
The idea of Capitals being on some nameless isles off the coast is a nice example. The creators may think this idea is a better one, since it's more convenient, closer to PvP zone, closer to each other's capital for some interaction, being focused on &quot;Orcs vs Humans&quot; idea&quot;. And the playerbase, voicing it's concerns, even with &quot;GG blizz unsub, idea sux dik&quot;, is an alert to Blizzard that something with this may be wrong. And therefore, they can choose whether or not to keep this, or to revert to the previous one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have no reason to care for these alliance/horde themed fort #3585, Bladespire and Karabur are wonderful and thematic, they truly mean something to the world. They look amazing. Hell i dont even idle, I'm the sort who visits the cities to bank, craft, use portals and npc's, (and like i said meet up with group of guildies ingame), and queue within. I would rather spend time doing all those things and chatting with guildies in Karabur and bladespire than another human/orc themed location. we already get that with garrisons. iam fine with that, it made sense. but this change, from wonderful areas i would gladly spend all of an expansion visiting as a central base of operations, to a place that EVEN if it uses new building models is STILL designed around the old Alliance and Orc themes that we have had for ages. Theres nothing wrong with that, except if its being given in Lieu of something wonderful like Bladespire and Karabur.<br />
<br />
We have all the reason to care about our capitals. BECAUSE they are the places people will be idling in. Because they are the places we spend so much time in. We will be staring at our capital a shit ton. And i would rather take karabur and bladespire for granted than a human/orc fort.<br />
<br />
ussually iam a dogged supporter of blizz's decisions and designs. stat squish, armor sets, race models, new quest structure, no flying (full support for this), stat structure, class changes, i love them all or see the logic behind them but the capitals changing is the first time that iam really irked and i just can't justify their reasons for this change to myself.</div></div><hr />

Touché on the player faction hubs, I guess I just wish people could act like adults about it instead of throwing fits when they disagree with something.<br />
<br />
I personally hate the shrines in MoP, they're cramped, and even zoomed all the way out give me a sense of claustrophobia. I know most people who say those who liked Dalaran are wrath babies, but I loved the more outdoor feel of it and Shatt, nice and open, far more appealing when considering it was a place for mass amounts of players to congregate. They were also centralized within the continent, and Wintergrasp had that great smack dab in the center of the continent feel as well, so even if you didn't own it and didn't have a portal to it, the flight was short and easily accessible. (Huurrrhhh, I can be constructive, luk gais it'z EZ :p)<br />
<br />
I haven't seen enough of the new faction hubs to give a valid opinion yet (Both the old and the new). I'll look into them shortly, but I doubt i'm going to find myself rage fitting over them. The garrison change does puzzle me, but I'm not going to be completely RAWR about it since beta just started.</div></div><hr />

Ugh, This has got to stop, passive yes men will not make this game better. Yes its Beta, and it is the PERFECT time to voice concern, since that is the best time it can be changed. Tiring to hear its only Alpha, Beta, Game/Patch just launched give it a chance etc...When exactly is it OK in your peoples eyes, to express disappointment? Many of us have been playing this game for the better part of a decade if not the whole 10 years, and gamers for longer. We know what is good and what is not, don't necessarily need to wait and see to know how it will affect the game.<br />
<br />
For all those bitching about people quitting the game over X feature, don't be so naive...its a collection of disappointments that brought them there, that X feature was/is the final one. This xpac...Warlords of Removal, well there are plenty of disappointments to easily justify the anger and quitting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shattrath had plenty of room for many players and flying around in the area made sense. Plus, A'dal! I love standing next to him and listening to ambient sound he emits.<br />
<br />
Also, I didn't touch Alliance until mid-Wrath so I never experienced Ironforge as THE place to be, but I still much prefer its Commons to Stormwind. Stormwind is cramped, especially since Blizz Deathwing wrecked the park.<br />

And indeed, Karabor/Bladespire will become ghosttownes when all questing is done, doesnt matter how epic they are.<br />

I played since Vanilla, and I have to say Dalaran was my favourite.<br />
<br />
It was perfectly situated in Northrend, in my opinion, not too far from level 80 endgame content hotspots - profession quests, Wintergrasp and Icecrown (for Argent Tournament stuff). Not just that, but the design of the city was so elegant and well-executed, that I still use it quite often. Some people complained that it was laggy for them, but I never really found that to be much of an issue.<br />

A lot of people are saying Ironforge - fuck Ironforge. Before flying mounts in Kalimdor/Eastern Kingdoms, falling down the stupid pit that spans half the fucking city was annoying as hell. Fuck Ironforge.</div></div><hr />

I never said it wasn't okay to disagree with a change. I completely disagree with the changes made to the garrisons, and the more I'm looking at the changes to the faction hubs, the more I agree with the players that this change is wrong! What I, and most other people, are tired of seeing are those throwing childish tantrums. I can make a reasonable assumption that Blizzard pays more attention to people who speak properly and give viable reasons as to why a change is bad, and back this opinion up with examples of why a previous model/build was better, or give a better option themselves.<br />
<br />
I'm curious why we're stuck in faction based hubs again and not getting a combine Sanctuary. These models worked well in the past and have proven to be highly enjoyed by players. (I have school currently, and haven't had my head buried in patch notes and content, maybe I'm missing one, if i am, my apologies). From my understanding, this expac is less about orc vs human and more the citizens of Azeroth fighting against a mightier foe than both of them. Wouldn't it make more sense to allow congregation? True, we've never been able to cross faction group or raid (/sad, that would've made SoO EPIC), but giving that feel of attempted camaraderie, at least to me, would be more positive than negative.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ForestWalker</div><div class="date">2014-06-28, 07:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure exactly what the real fuss is about the hubs being in Ashran. They are putting portals and banks there for us to run in do our stuff then leave... I pretty much do that currently and have done that since vanilla. I enjoy finding a zone to park in when I'm not needing to pull items from my bank tab to craft. I enjoyed Shrine in MoP but my favorite zone is Jade Forest at the Temple of the Jade Serpent so I'm frequently there just enjoying the view. I'll likely use my Garrison to port me to Ashran hearth back and fly to where ever else I enjoy being in WoD. I think it is fine to complain, but perhaps the rage is really not needed.... I was one of those people in BC who as a Belf actually would go back to Silvermoon to enjoy the sights of it even if I had no reason to be there, just go on a trip and see where you end up. Also I'm not really thrilled with the &quot;sameness&quot; of the face and just hope it is something that hasn't been implemented yet or the art craft can alleviate the concern I have for that particular aspect of the model. I was a bit shocked at the post by lore and some other dev posts but after reading most of the comments on them I can see why they get a bit tired of the likely constant bombardment of questions, rants, complaints, or even just repetitive nature of peoples inquiries. I hope they can remain civil at least but being a person who would gladly unleash a zombie apocalypse on every person who breathed I am just glad they avoid going postal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I too am getting a little tired of the people who keep stating the obvious. Everyone knows this is beta. But seriously, have you not figured out by now that that's the perfect time to express how much you like/dislike a potential change? <br />
<br />
We talked for ages about button bloat. Now they're pruning abilities and it feels like they're removing ones we loved, yet keeping others that many don't even have on their bars. Honestly the only reason a lot of us bother staying at this point is time invested, and lack of a better replacement. That doesn't mean we have to like all of the changes.<br />
<br />
I'm generally pretty complacent with things because I've always been a firm believer that the game needs to have consistent change to survive. This time just feels different though. Aside from new zone/models, there isn't a single freaking thing that has me excited about WoD. Even garrisons have me underwhelmed.</div></div><hr />

Dalaran, because it had everything except trainers and AH, and it was small enough that, even without flying, it wasn't a hassle going from place to place</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gwiez</div><div class="date">2014-06-29, 03:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For the poll, where's the Ironforge option? I'm not wearing rose colored nostalgia glasses, it had its lag problems when everyone was parked in front of the bank (which paled in comparison to Dalaran lag). But Ironforge has great layout. Navigating around Ironforge on a ground mount was even easier than Stormwind on a flying mount. Finding trainers, vendors, etc was easy as pie. Oh, and IF has a pie vendor. <br />
<br />
Putting the faction hubs out on an island next to the pvp zone makes flying look even less likely. Ironic, since the justification Blizzard gave for wanting to ground players the whole expansion was because they wanted to move away from separating content by putting it on islands and keep content integrated inside the leveling zones. <br />
<br />
I hope we don't get stuck with those PitA keep/barracks buildings in our faction hub. I hate doubling back on myself multiple times, and falling down the stairs when I do finally find the right flight to climb. Also, we need the city chat channels in more places than just a tiny camp away from most of the content.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Danify</div><div class="date">2014-06-29, 03:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why can't Blizzard use both Bladespire | Karabor along with the Alliance and Horde building capital hubs on the outskirts of Ashran. Remember at the end of Burning Crusade, the Shattering Sun went to the Isle of Quel'Danas and slowly built toward unlocking the Sunwell and the different stages of the Isle. <br />
<br />
For example, the first four to six weeks in the expansion could have the Alliance and Horde capitals being in Bladespire and Karabor while server-wide events are taking place in the two &quot;hubs&quot; outside of Ashran. It would allow for an similar feel to what they wanted out of their original plan and make the &quot;lore&quot; behind the lame excuses to move the capitals from Bladespire and Karabor make more sense.</div></div><hr />

This is why you always have to say little and do much.<br />
<br />
By telling us that something was going to be put in, you've put it in game as far as the player base is concerned. Once you remove aspects of it or nerf it to the ground, whatever is left is viewed as a removal rather than a cool addition.</div></div><hr />

The heirloom thing would have been awesome for me , instead of having to keep all that in one toons bank ...then keep that toon around for that purpose instead of using the slot for a toon I want to level.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I could make the toon I am using as a bank to level and keep heirlooms in but...it is still bank space I could use. <br />
<br />
As for the rest of the news.<br />
<br />
Meh, I am kind of getting to the point where &quot;announced features&quot; don't mean a thing until the expac ships.<br />
<br />
Underwhelmed at the &quot;feature list&quot; thus far.<br />

I am sure there are a good amount of people content with what is coming.<br />

Oh snap, guess WoW is NOT gonna suffer from singleface syndrome. Better start finding something else to complain abo....oh yes capital city thread<br />

The artcraft post is to explain why we have to accept singleface. Those dwarf face screenshots are literally all the same and don't match at all the old model faces.</div></div><hr />

You give classes that completely counter us more surv than we have. What gives?<br />

Spriest really have no place in arena. When it comes to rbgs, they usually get picked last like the fat kid in dodgeball. People criticize us about our damage not being immense when we're dispelling and ccing our asses off as well as off-healing.</div></div><hr />

I certainly remember, and can separate the terrible servers and programmers Blizzard used from the wonderful Artwork. If only they would put in the same effort on the &quot;cities&quot; in WoD and MoP</div></div><hr />

Really disappointed in the heirloom tab, faction hubs, and garrisons. For an xpack that is taking so long to get done and that cost more $ it sure seems to be turning out to be more like a partial expansion or even just a huge patch. IMO<br />
<br />
I already pre-ordered but if I had not this would be the first time since I started playing that I probably wouldn't grab the expansion when it came out.</div></div><hr />
