Warlords of Draenor - Tier 17 Warrior Armor Sets<br />
Today we are taking a look at the Tier 17 Warrior armor sets.<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor changes things up slightly by using one set of art for Raid Finder, one set of art for Normal and Heroic, and one set of art for Mythic difficulty. You can find the Raid Finder armor sets in our Raid Finder armor sets preview (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3940-Warlords-of-Draenor-Raid-Finder-Armor-Sets-Draenei-Guard-Armor-Set-Blue-Tweets-Art). <br />

Blizzard Entertainment Returns to San Diego Comic Con<br />
Blizzard is proud to announce that we'll be returning to this year's San Diego Comic Con, bringing with us never-before-seen treasures and show exclusives from our Licensing Team! Keep an eye out for schedule details and exciting product reveals (coming soon).<br />
<br />
We hope to see you there!<br />

Conquest Catch Up Cap<br />
The formula is (weeks in the season - 1) * 1000 + 1800 (arena cap) - conquest earned this season <br />
<br />
So to use your example, your cap is 14800 now because it's the 14th week of the season and you haven't earned any conquest yet.<br />
<br />
Let's say you win 20 games (3600 conquest) before the weekly reset. Your cap on Tuesday is going to be<br />
<br />
14 * 1000 + 1800 - 3600 = 12200<br />
Ayani is mostly correct. One tiny correction to the order things are calculated, for those who might be interested in the math:<br />
<br />
((Weeks in the season - 1) * 1000) - Conquest earned this season = catch up cap<br />
Catch up cap + Arena/RBG cap (based on rating) = total amount of Conquest you can earn this week<br />
<br />
Also: the catch up cap doesn't &quot;reset&quot; if you don't work through it all in one week. Feel free to chip away at it when you have time <br />
<br />
Real quick before you run off lore, the debate was whether you continue gaining the catch up cap if you &quot;chip into it&quot; as you put it <br />
Short answer: yes.<br />
<br />
Long answer: The catch-up cap is re-calculated from scratch on a weekly basis. It's not that you're earning an extra 1000 points of catch-up cap every week, it's that you're being awarded an amount based on how many weeks the season has been running. It's a minor difference in approach but an important one, as it means there isn't anything to &quot;lose&quot; (or &quot;not gain&quot;) to begin with.<br />
<br />
To put it another way: every week, you will have 1000 Conquest points for every week (except the first) added to your cap, minus the total number of Conquest points you've earned for the season. If it's week 14 and you've earned 3000 Conquest points already this season, you'll have 10,000 added to your weekly cap. That's done regardless of when you earned those 3000 points.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps clarify (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/317199-question-about-14800-conquest-cap/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13021652291?page=2#25))<br />

Why is being GCD capped worse than being resources capped? More actions per minute = more fun for me<br />
Because it removes timing from the gameplay choices you can make, for the most part. Pooling is a great form of gameplay for some. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470804470087950336))<br />
That's why we try to provide a mix of different playstyles; some GCD-capped, some not. Something for everyone, hopefully. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470804580008075264))<br />
<br />
One last Q: If Mana-using DPS are built to NEVER run oom doing damage, why have mana instd of special resource 4 utility skills?<br />
Because not everyone needs to have a special resource. Time is a very effective resource. Just different types of gameplay. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470785785424125952))<br />
I have to say I dislike that logic. What is the point of mana if it's an arbitrary blue bar that serves no purpose?<br />
It doesn't serve *no* purpose, it just doesn't serve as a limit on DPS. It usually limits utility/offhealing. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470807628738617345))<br />

Any chance to see minor glyph that turns pestilence icon, visual and sound effects into blood boil ones?<br />
No need. The visuals were merged too. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470749180928212993))<br />
Can we get his animation back? https://t.co/siA80h8tif<br />
No, I don't think we're using a 10x size, red-tinted Banish visual. It might be new, don't recall. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470754474131488768))<br />

focus due to capping from time casting. Did I calculate anything wrong?<br />
Sounds right. Focusing Shot is/will be tuned to expect *some* amount of wasted focus. This sounds like one unavoidable case. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470714644517376000))<br />
Steady, focusing, cobra - is there really a point to the difference between steady and cobra now that sting is SV?<br />
How much the spec's damage is mitigated by Armor (and other physical damage reduction). (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470718386272755713))<br />
<br />
IE, steady focus + weapon focus marksman flavour, serpent sting + magic mastery survival... BM wat<br />
Well, at the end of the day, BM is about beasts, and Cobra Shot *does* shoot a cobra. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470728718508650497))<br />
<br />
with SV being magical based dmg, why introduce bear trap which is a bleed. That seems MM oriented.<br />
Traps are more closely linked to Survival than magic damage is. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470781306742140928))<br />

Holy Nova takes what position for Disc? AOE healing? Spot spam for fun?<br />
Efficient AoE healing. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470761266265337856))<br />
<br />
ty, another question was whether the new HN will be similar to current one, in terms of cast time etc<br />
Yes, still instant. Much stronger healing effectiveness. Radius is a little bigger, too. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470761453448753152))<br />
what about damage? about the same?<br />
Damage still about the same (very minor). (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470762028844339201))<br />
<br />
Void Entropy. Designed for when we have too many orbs and DP is not enough to spend? Or will it provide more dmg/orb than DP?<br />
Way more dmg/orb that DP. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470778383081562113))<br />
About DP, thread on Clarity talent on mmo-champ say's eventually mastery will make MS spam out do DP:I. What are your thoughts?<br />
We think that it's a valid concern we're going to watch for when we get to the tuning phase, and make adjustments if necessary. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470804203758051328))<br />

You mentioned that Enhance would do more active dps, but most spells do reduced % of wep damage now, higher % white as a result?<br />
We also reduced weapon damage by 50%. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470778095444586496))<br />

Would like to know how do Glad Wars work with set bonuses? Are we considered melee under boss mechanics or tanks? explain pls<br />
Set bonuses will benefit Gladiators. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470778020802748416))<br />
<br />
The problem is losing all those SD procs for CS to occupy rage free, damaging GCD's. Losing OP hurts as well.<br />
What SD procs were lost? I'd double-check your theorycraft. From experience, in blues in 6.0 Arms, I'm easily GCD capped,... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470780468212690944))<br />
...and able to replace some of them with Execute. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470780565256278016))<br />
<br />
Will Gladiator Stance still be able to have access to Rallying Cry/Demo Banner? Or since tech. Prot lose utility?<br />
No; that's an intended weakness of Gladiator; light on the raid utility. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470781138357600257))<br />
<br />
Art<br />
Any chance we could be able to change how guns sound on our own client? I love the models but the sound gives me a headache.<br />
Guns have new sounds in 6.0. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470273120041848833))<br />
<br />
Character / Items<br />
serious question. How many shamans do you see with shields? You do allow them to use staff and off hands....<br />
The vast vast majority. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470749313807953920))<br />
Why is the 1st Garrosh heirloom that caster Shaman receive set to be the staff then?<br />
It's not. It's 50/50 staff/mace, because both are usable weapons. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/470752533179539456))<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor Stats<br />
why does it say Multistrike and Readiness changed? They look the same - what am I missing?<br />
Added descriptions of both, and changed Multistrike to be &quot;2 X% rolls&quot; instead of &quot;2 X/2% rolls&quot;. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469914564503801856))<br />
so is it correct to assume it now caps at 100%? Just syntax, really<br />
Correct. No functional change, just more understandable, hopefully. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469924450301800448))<br />
<br />
amplify not mentioned as a secondary stat, does it still exist or was it scrapped?<br />
Postponed. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469931369745756160))<br />
<br />
Im curious. Why did you guys not go even lower with the stat squish? Like back to vanilla levels for example.<br />
That's exactly what we did, actually 1-60 was linear progression. We extended that same linearity up to 90. Health was doubled. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470777885288955904))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
can you please prevent people with ressurrection sickness from joining LFR?<br />
I think the underlying issue there is that res sickness is probably too punitive at this point. We'll evaluate. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/470713230395207681))<br />
<br />
Glad to hear you can get gear from them. But CMs do still focus on time trial, and have downscaled gear<br />
True, though the gear reward is for completion; speed run for cosmetic perks. And early on downscaling won't be felt at all. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/470952559734435840))<br />
<br />
Is there any reason the LFR philosophy hasn't been applied to LFD? ie LFD easy, norm/hero/myth harder w/ no random groups<br />
Challenge mode is the &quot;no random groups&quot; hard version of dungeons. And now you can get some epic gear from doing them. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/470950565032505344))<br />
Really just want more options for dungeons like there are for raids.<br />
Totally understand. Heroics with a Silver Proving Ground requirement to queue are a bit of a middle ground, at least. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/470952664768217088))<br />
<br />
More relevant question: How are you going to handle the new Role Summary tab of the Dungeon Journal? Unlock after some time?<br />
Why would it need to be locked at all? The point is to offer a tl;dr overview that's easier to absorb than the full Abilities list. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/470951070379020288))<br />
Using Garrosh as a preview: I don't like that it just tells you exactly everything to do. Video games should be about learning.<br />
It doesn't tell you to clump for MC; nor to make sure 30% of your raid stands out to position Weapons, etc. It's not about strat. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/471053654754336769))<br />
A fight might have 10 different abilities; the aim is to call out the 3 or so most important things for your role. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/471053943007891456))<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor<br />
Why so much transparency in this Alpha? Other Alpha's were more tight lipped. Not that I mind it, it's awesome to see.<br />
We thought we could do better. The community interaction is valuable, from many angles. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469912253945634816))<br />

Indeed! At first, as I saw the red color, I thought Cataclysm. &quot;The belt looks exactly like the jaw of Deathwing&quot;. Then I saw the green one. &quot;No, the set is a freaking Fel Reaver! The belt is a part from it&quot;, Burning Crusade. And then the blue style. &quot;Oh.. now it looks like the crown of Lich King..&quot; Sweet, Wrath of the Lich King.<br />

You might think it looks boring, but to me, I've never had this reaction to a set. The color sets a totally different atmosphere. Love the green one. Fel.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am a huge fan of bright colours though.<br />
<br />
Edit: Looking at it again, most of the normal and heroic warrior set looks quite okay. It's the helm that ruins it for me on that one. Take off that helm, and the set looks a whole lot better.</div></div><hr />

Why is it always green though, i'm not a warlock i don't want green fire coming out from my armor! I especially do not want green fire coming out of my belt!<br />
<br />
Lucky for you, they've added this cool feature called Transmogrification. No longer must we be forced to wear what we perceive as ugly!</div></div><hr />

Thanks Blizzard, from this humble warrior. I don't care if i have to wait til 7.0 to get it (since it will be mythic most likely).</div></div><hr />

Well, rewards reflect the commitment. Making the LFR sets non-transmogable... Now that would be taking a shit on the LFR players. Even if I somehow end up just doing LFR in WoD, I would find that extremely hilarious, though cruel. <br />
<br />
I think I know the perfect April 1st &quot;announcement&quot;. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor changes things up slightly by using one set of art for Raid Finder, one set of art for Normal and Heroic, and one set of art for Mythic difficulty. You can find the Raid Finder armor sets in our Raid Finder armor sets preview. <br />
<br />
Well right here you are showing 3 different armor sets, which leads me to think these are the sets for LFR - Normal/Heroic - Mythic, but then when I check the link you supplied for LFR previews, I see a a completely different (hideous) set.<br />
<br />
Did you mean that Normal and Heroic have different gear sets? Because the comment above made me think their set art was shared?</div></div><hr />

The fancy set is Mythic and one of the other two sets will be used for Normal and Heroic.</div></div><hr />

I don't want to think about how it is attached. Of course, the most immediate issue is that your genitalia are on fire. Which actually may be appropriate for warriors.</div></div><hr />
