Now that BFA Season 1 is underway, we’ve seen a number of questions about the item levels of various rewards and reward tiers. Here’s an outline of the current item levels you’ll see when you receive rewards from ranked PvP:<br />
<br />
<br />
Tier, Rating, End of Match iLvl, Weekly cache iLvl, Weekly Azerite item iLvl <br />
Unranked, 0 – 1399, item level 340, item level 355, item level 355 <br />
Combatant, 1400 – 1599, item level 350, item level 365, item level 355 <br />
Challenger, 1600 – 1799, item level 360, item level 370, item level 370 <br />
Rival, 1800 – 2099, item level 365, item level 375, item level 370 <br />
Duelist, 2100 – 2399, item level 370, item level 380, item level 385 <br />
Gladiator, 2400+, item level 375, item level 385, item level 385 <br />
<br />
Some reminders:<br />
End of match rewards are occasional.<br />
For your weekly Azerite item Conquest turn-in, see Marshal Gabriel in the Salt and Shanty Inn near the Ashvane Docks in Boralus or Xander Silberman at Mugambala in Zandalar.<br />
You’ll loot your weekly cache reward from a chest in that area.<br />
The weekly cache items can Warforge/Titanforge.<br />
<br />
Now go strike down your enemies!<br />
<br />
Does this mean there are two separate weekly rewards? One from conquest turn in and one from a chest? Still confused with this system, it needs further explaining.<br />
<br />
There is two things yes. The End of Match reward and the Weekly Cache. The Cache is a chest at the two PvP hubs, which can reward Azerite items or non-Azerite items. Since Azerite items are set item levels that cannot Warforge or Titanforge that's why their item levels are listed out.<br />
<br />
The table we made is a little misleading as we tried to format it as best as we could on these forums. The weekly reward and the Azerite are the same thing, if the weekly chest contained an Azerite piece that's the ilvl it would be.<br />
<br />
Hey just wondering is it intended for pvp conquest cap reward to be 280? Seems a little weird that it rewards gear lower then world quests by quite a bit. Thanks.<br />
Conquest rewards for the first week of the new PvP Season are an item level 345 weapon of your choice from class options. We're working on a fix to display the correct item level. (Source (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/1037408409396568065))<br />
<br />
We can change weapons? Appears to just be an ele weapon.<br />
Once you reach 500 Conquest, you'll be given a quest to return to The Mugambala or Hook Point that lets you choose your weapon. The one displayed in the UI is just an example of one option. (Source (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/1037413116806488064))<br />
<br />
Just want to clear this up cause got quite a few psts cause i was the closest to 2100, i can confirm that there is no new enchant at 2100 boys i already have all 3 of the other enchants so i cannot tell you which ones it gives when you hit duelist<br />
We're actually going to be adding an Elite Enchant for 2100 (Duelist) soon on a vendor within Hook Point/Mugambala soon. Sorry for the delay on that. (Source (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1100863-no-new-enchant-at-2100/))<br />

Also, it appears that you lose your Season 7 Legion titles now that BFA Season 1 started. Logged in today and don't have my Gladiator title from Legion Season 7 anymore. Pathetic. Why did I get Glad in Season 7 then? Just for the mount? I don't like it and can't use it indoors to show off hehe. Such bad decisions...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Feels like a change in design philosophy. Many expansions past were about getting the gear needed to raid and having that be the pinnacle of that tier. Now, it seems more about &quot;just go do whatever you find fun&quot; and you will find items that you can slowly climb with. <br />
<br />
Honestly I dislike that as a design decision. Personal thing but I like the distinct tiers.</div></div><hr />

All the gear from IE is transmog gear. Recolors of old tier sets and stuff like that</div></div><hr />

There's a lot to do in-game and they see that. Rather than choosing for you that raiding is the pinnacle of wow everybody must participate in for better gear, they offer more paths to take towards that. Most players put value on that or looking fly with cosmetics/mounts/pets.</div></div><hr />

I like the design decision. Having more time to waste in raids does not mean you should be rewarded more than other players who don't have as much time to waste. Content can still be challenging and not take as much time (M+)</div></div><hr />

I would wager it is the quest you get to win a warfront which rewards a 370 item. You probably can repeat it weekly.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, thats whats confusing, because there is also a &quot;warfront win gear&quot; listed, which is 340.</div></div><hr />

Well the quest gives a 370 and I think you also get a 340 for winning the warfront, from what I recall.</div></div><hr />

It's the same problem as with the last stat squish... They let those numbers inflate too quickly again. At the the end of the addon I bet we are at least in the 50-100k range.</div></div><hr />

<br />
true but in the long term you will be excactly there in the next expension like before. One &quot;good&quot; squished expansion but in the next one you are in the millions again.</div></div><hr />

With Combatant - Duelist, you get the achivement and get the title immediately, but do you lose the title if you drop below the threshold?<br />
<br />
With Glad, it requires 50 wins to get the title in the bracket, if you drop below the bracket, do you lose the 50 win progress you may have had before?</div></div><hr />
