it's been that way since the beginning. chests have always just been a texture overlay on top of the normal skin texture. shoulders and helms are what makes it.</div></div><hr />

there are some sweet ass robes though in this game. ESPECIALLY in BC, while pixelated now, the designs were solid. This just doesn't look very good by itself, to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would assume they make the most money from race and faction changes. You still need an appearance change for your character's gender and name.<br />
<br />
Side note, those robes remind me of Draenei so I'd guess the next raid will probably be Shattrath.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It says &quot;before she went crazy&quot; I guess it was referring to her going from nice and neutral to outright bloody vengeance. Though I don't consider her crazy for wanting revenge for what was done to her townsmen/town and other atrocities Garrosh had done. <br />
<br />
I mean if she was crazy she would of jumped in front of Varian and fireballed the new Troll Chieftain of the Horde into a little pile of ash and laid waste to all the horde in the chamber including Garrosh at the end of SoO.<br />
<br />
Though it could mean that in this expansion she does some things one would consider irrational and crazy... hmm.. I'll have to read the quests my first time through...</div></div><hr />

I was originally only planning on buying a makeover my forsaken (her face with the black eyes is gone now), but now that I've looked at all of the options on the PTR I know I'll be wanting to change more than just her.

<br />
Many P2P games do paid services. They are not required, and honestly Blizzard didn't have to add them. People could have been forced to delete that max level raiding character if they wanted to change its race, or be forced to stick with it. Maybe level another one. There is nothing wrong with charging &quot;Extra&quot; for a game that isn't needed. It is just that, extra. The only problem with F2P games being more popular is whiny people who see EVERY extra transaction as &quot;Micro&quot; transactions.</div></div><hr />

It's a tooltip correction. Go read the whole set of patch notes and realize how ignorant this sounds.

Don't worry! The goblin barber will be happy to show you his PhD from the University of Kezan. He's got it here somewhere... No, no, never mind that catalogue of degrees for sale... Oh, that 25,000g receipt from U of K is a total coincidence... Aha, here it is! Beautiful as the day it came in the mai—er, he means, the day he was handed it in a top-notch graduation ceremony that he did not just make up! Now, what did you want to look like?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, it's part of a questing (at least I think it's questing, it's the standard armor for premades on beta) green chest armor.</div></div><hr />

OT: very nice to allow facial recustomization in-game. Saves some real money for those who are really upset with how their character is going to look like next expac</div></div><hr />

Inb4 item:120205 costs 15$ at the shop.<br />
Item 120205? 'XP' according to WoWHead? You mean the 'Level 90 Booster'?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or perhaps the stupid rants about milking the playerbase are being proven wrong ?<br />
Not that it would stop anyone complaining, as they would fabricate a reason as to why this is a bad thing for players.<br />
Perhaps complaining about the gold cost, when the current value is pretty trivial to earn for players at any decent level.</div></div><hr />

That thing is amazing, life just got so much simpler and better.<br />
Leveling seems slow as does combat in Draenor, but nvm that. <br />
Old instances back to back all day everyday with that buff. The game is back!</div></div><hr />

Doesnt seem very likely, but even if it lasted a coupld months--so what? Its not terribly expensive... Those who want to face change will do so early on for every toon they need. After that, new toons will get the new faces at creation.</div></div><hr />

Erm.. Have you ever used the barber shop? Its yellow because it was changed...</div></div><hr />
