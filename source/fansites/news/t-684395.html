Ionar, in the Halls of Lightning, will now only disperse once during the course of the fight.<br />
Prophet Tharon’Ja of Drak'Tharon will now only steal your flesh one time during the encounter.<br />
Players with the quest “Wrath of the Lich King” will now properly receive quest credit.<br />
Muradin and Saurfang will no longer gain stacks of Battlefury from totems. Additionally, the duration of Battlefury has also been reduced.<br />
Lord Marrowgar is now tauntable.<br />
The Looking For Group item level requirement for Halls of Reflection has been raised to match the difficulty of the encounters. <br />
<br />
Deathbringer Saurfang Hotfix<br />
Deathbringer Saurfang's Rune of Blood has been modified to heal 10 times the amount of damage dealt instead of 5 times the damage. This will make the encounter more difficult if you try to tank Saurfang with just one character. The tooltip does not reflect this change, but it will in a future patch. <br />

Looting Items in the New Dungeon System<br />
There has been some confusion regarding looting items when using the new Dungeon Finder system so we would like to take a moment and provide an explanation for some of these new features.<br />
<br />
Anytime players are matched up with other players using the Dungeon Finder system, the looting option is automatically set to “Need Before Greed” which is designed to be a fair system that rewards items to the classes they are designed for. While there can be some finer details on how this works, here is an overview on this system:<br />
<br />
The “need” option is only available for both armor and weapons that are designed for your class. Caster classes and hybrid caster classes can roll “need” on items with intellect and/or spell power while melee classes cannot. Melee classes and hybrid melee classes can roll “need” on the items without intellect and/or spell power. There is an additional restriction that only allows characters to roll for armor items if it’s the armor type that is designed for their class. So since cloth armor is designed for mages, priests, and warlocks only they can roll “need” on these armor types. Then leather armor is for druids and rogues, mail armor for hunters and shaman, and plate for death knights, paladins, and warriors. Keep in mind that these restrictions only apply to items above a certain item level since the breakdown of stats is very different in the early leveling area of the game.<br />
<br />
We also introduced a “disenchant” option that is open to all classes on all items whenever a player with the sufficient level of skill in enchanting is in the group to disenchant the item that just dropped. If the winner of the item has selected this option the item will automatically be disenchanted and the resulting material(s) placed in the character’s bags instead of the item. Just like it was before the patch, disenchanting any item is not reversible and the item is permanently removed so you should only select this option if you have no plans to use the item or trade it to another player.<br />
<br />
The “greed” option is open to all classes and all item types but the players who roll greed will also roll against those who select disenchant. The reason for this is that if an item is not a high priority and/or eligible to be rolled “need” on, then other players running the dungeon have an equal chance to get a reward for defeating the encounter.<br />
<br />
As far as how the whole Dungeon Finder system works, it matches up characters with others in their entire Battlegroup instead of just their individual realm. Once a dungeon is completed players go back to their respective realms where they cannot communicate or trade with players on other realms, so any items you gained in the dungeon can no longer be traded to another character in the group. If you are considering giving an item to another player, you must do so before either character leaves the dungeon.<br />
<br />
We appreciate all of the feedback from the community so far and we will continue to monitor and resolve any questions or issues as they come up. <br />

Blue posts<br />
Battered Hilt Droprate<br />
<br />
We do not provide specific drop rates on the forums. The Battered Hilt has had three different drop rates now since the release of patch 3.3, none of which do we intend to share on the forums.<br />
<br />
Yes, getting the hilt is rare and also intended to provide a more casual-friendly weapon. This doesn't mean a player who is not raiding should expect to get an ilevel 251 weapon within eight days of the patch's release, much less be angry when he or she doesn't. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/21726258628-battered-hilt-and-epic-drop-rate-changes.html))<br />

Empowered Imp/Conflagrate bug?<br />
Empowered Imp is not being eaten by Conflag ticks. The data aren't set up that way and we can't observe it happening. You can test it yourself by waiting for Empowered Imp to proc and then casting nothing but Conflag to see if the buff goes away.<br />
<br />
There may be something else happening, but it's not as simple as just losing the Empowered Imp proc from Conflag. If anyone has any more information, please let us know. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/21726258943-empowered-imp-math.html))<br />

Sweeping Strikes and Bladestorm<br />
We're trying to fix the interaction between Sweeping Strikes and Bladestorm. The purpose of Sweeping Strikes is to let your attacks hit more targets, not hit the targets you are already hitting harder.<br />
<br />
[...] Bladestorm should not be able to use Sweeping Strikes to transfer all that damage to a single target. As I said above, the purpose of Sweeping Strikes is to hit *additional* targets not just cause more damage to existing targets. I believe Whirlwind works with Sweeping Strikes correctly, so we'd like to get Bladestorm to work the same way.<br />
<br />
This change will then let us see if any of the concern about Bladestorm in PvP is founded or if it's not an issue without Sweeping Strikes inflating the damage.<br />
<br />
We don't think this will be a real nerf to PvE Arms warriors, but if it chills out their AE damage in those very specific situations where there are several closely grouped adds and Arms damage skyrockets, then I agree that's a good thing.

The Need before Greed system screwed me over already.

Prophet Tharon&#8217;Ja of Drak'Tharon will now only steal your flesh one time during the encounter.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ionar was soooo annoying. Disperse, merge, fight 5sec and he disperse again...<br />
Tharon'Ja wasn't nearly as bad.<br />
<br />
edit: <br />
The Looking For Group item level requirement for Halls of Reflection has been raised to match the difficulty of the encounters. <br />
So now I can spec resto and not worry about being thrown into HoR heroic with my nab gear :D (PoS heroic is actually doable with said gear. HoR seems not)<br />
<br />
Kinda funny, my lesser geared shaman got grouped for heroic PoS(and after, HoR) more than my much better geared lock. (which havent completed PoS yet, so cant go into HoR)</div></div><hr />

<br />
This would actually effect a (relatively easy) achievement, beating anub in time. Submerges are okay because you get something to do while he is away (and not just spamming 1 and 4 and sometimes 2 as tank like with Tharon) and imo he comes back when you're finished with the adds (or maybe we are just so slow)</div></div><hr />

LOL - how should they make it? 1. Version: &quot;We have to kill them&quot; &lt;insert drama here&gt;, Janina: &quot;Screw you Arthas, gonna play with myself then ...) <br />
<br />
2. Arthas runs right to the gate, sees Malganis &gt; LEEERRROOOYYYYYYYYYYY JENKINS! &gt; Death &amp; Destruction<br />
<br />
Btw. I don't like the new changes to HC's - yeah, maybe with an IMBA 240 EQ they were a bit annoying, but I wouldn't set the encounter to just &quot;one&quot; disperse etc. - I would make the skill proccs dmg wise. So a party with a low DPS hast like 3-4 Disperse while a IMBA group gets just one because after one he's dead meat :P<br />
<br />
And to the Need &gt; Greed System ... well, how about a system, where a caster can roll need on any castergear, if everyone selected disenchant/greed? Wouldn't hurt then...</div></div><hr />

Also, the &quot;Need before greed&quot; system is bullshit, especially for leveling players or people who are freshly 80. I know we can get gear with badges now etc etc, but it's nice to be able to gear up a bit in the dungeon as well.

Exactly! So why the nerf?<br />
It was a well balanced fight for pug raids (after dmg nerf on 10 man) and a nice way to learn a popular boss mechanic - aggro reset.<br />
When a hunter pulled aggro on a reset last week, we just explained to him that aggro resets and if he wants to shoot straight away to just MD. He did. He gets +1 to experience, we get the boss down anyway. I thought that was the whole point of raids as opposed to just grinding mobs around?</div></div><hr />

When a hunter pulled aggro on a reset last week, we just explained to him that aggro resets and if he wants to shoot straight away to just MD. He did. He gets +1 to experience, we get the boss down anyway. I thought that was the whole point of raids as opposed to just grinding mobs around?<br />

Have the ability on a timed CD. If you take too long killing him, he disperses multiple times. If you're so imba, you might not see it at all.</div></div><hr />

10 man Marrowgar was doing 25 man damage. That is NOT balanced. You didn't have a problem because you probably went in with 25 man gear. 10 man raiding guilds that did only 10 man content had 10 man gear, making the fight unbalanced.</div></div><hr />

Our Guild killed him on Patchday-Night. Of course it took a couple of attempts to figure out the boss resetting aggro after whirlwind but thats about it.<br />
Did it with two Healpriests and a Frostmage for replanishment and, i think 5th attempt, he was down.<br />
Yes, there was a lot of damage coming in, but it was doable.<br />

That still doesn't mean it's balanced. My statement was correct. That was the exact damage Marrowgar was doing. Blizzard messed up before the patch went live and gave 10 man Marrowgar 25 man Marrowgar's damage. That is EXACTLY what happened. It doesn't matter what your guild did, it doesn't change the truth in my statement.<br />

Marrowgar 10 was supposed to do X damage, he wasn't doing X damage, so Blizzard fixed it. It was a bug fix, not a nerf.</div></div><hr />

Just trying to make a point. Reading this and the WoW forums makes a person cynical. It doesn't affect me because I do 25 and 10 man content, but too many people call it a &quot;nerf&quot; when it was technically a bug fix.</div></div><hr />

I agree with you on one thing, to remove the class restrictions for casters overall.<br />
But clothies can only use cloth. Leathies can use leather AND cloth, making the loot threshold for, let's say Moonkins, much wider than what it is for a mage, but not being able to need it as a moonkin kind of sucks, i guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, because there are 2-3 items (outside of tier pieces) per patch that are actually well-itemized for moonkins when it comes to leather. Spiritless items are at a premium when it comes to cloth as well, but for leather it is just retarted.</div></div><hr />

That's why I said that he is balanced after the dmg nerf. My group had a mix of 226/232/245 geared players with one healer being even around 213 level and although we have downed him on patch day I think it was too stressful on healers and I had to burn cooldowns while tanking to ease it up on them. It was not tuned for every day PuGs and another alarming fact was that Lady Deathwhisper seemed to require much less effort on part of healers and tanks.</div></div><hr />

This is exactly what I was just thinking (was actually going to post something like this until I saw yours). Add to this a warning (also mentioned somewhere above) when you select DE for a BoE epic (maybe rare as well), to avoid accidentally sharding something with significant AH value. Also, since any BoE with real value is likely to end up on the AH anyway, class restrictions should be removed for rolling need on BoE items.</div></div><hr />

They should just automatically roll Greed for everyone. No window pops up, if you win it just goes into your bag. You should only see a window in 2 scenarios:<br />
<br />
Scenario One: You meet the 'Need Threshold'. You get a window asking if you Need the item. Clicking 'Yes' gets you a priority roll, clicking 'No' gets you a Greed roll like everyone else.<br />
<br />
And<br />
<br />
Scenario Two: IF you have an enchanter with high enough skill and IF you win the Greed roll, you get a window asking if you want to Keep the item or DE it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also agree and the point you made about clothies being restricted is dead right, which is why most reasonable Ele/Boomkin players would ask a clothy if they needed the cloth item before rolling need themselves.<br />
<br />
I've been gearing my new lvl 80 Ele Shammy recently and luckily i've managed to win some of the greed rolls i've had to make on easily superior cloth items (damn you MP5 mail), but i've also see lots of great upgrades for me going the way of DE mats, which i dont blame the players who DE as i DE everything else that i dont need aswell. I think Blizz need to be a bit more lenient with Boomkin and Ele rolling.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlord</div><div class="date">2009-12-17, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looting Items in the New Dungeon System<br />
There has been some confusion regarding looting items when using the new Dungeon Finder system so we would like to take a moment and provide an explanation for some of these new features.<br />
<br />
Anytime players are matched up with other players using the Dungeon Finder system, the looting option is automatically set to “Need Before Greed” which is designed to be a fair system that rewards items to the classes they are designed for. While there can be some finer details on how this works, here is an overview on this system:<br />
<br />
The “need” option is only available for both armor and weapons that are designed for your class. Caster classes and hybrid caster classes can roll “need” on items with intellect and/or spell power while melee classes cannot. Melee classes and hybrid melee classes can roll “need” on the items without intellect and/or spell power. There is an additional restriction that only allows characters to roll for armor items if it’s the armor type that is designed for their class. So since cloth armor is designed for mages, priests, and warlocks only they can roll “need” on these armor types. Then leather armor is for druids and rogues, mail armor for hunters and shaman, and plate for death knights, paladins, and warriors. Keep in mind that these restrictions only apply to items above a certain item level since the breakdown of stats is very different in the early leveling area of the game.<br />
<br />
We also introduced a “disenchant” option that is open to all classes on all items whenever a player with the sufficient level of skill in enchanting is in the group to disenchant the item that just dropped. If the winner of the item has selected this option the item will automatically be disenchanted and the resulting material(s) placed in the character’s bags instead of the item. Just like it was before the patch, disenchanting any item is not reversible and the item is permanently removed so you should only select this option if you have no plans to use the item or trade it to another player.<br />
<br />
The “greed” option is open to all classes and all item types but the players who roll greed will also roll against those who select disenchant. The reason for this is that if an item is not a high priority and/or eligible to be rolled “need” on, then other players running the dungeon have an equal chance to get a reward for defeating the encounter.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
so sinds when did they change the need thingy cos last week it was still 1 big buggy thing. they say cloth with int and/or sp is for mage/priest/locks but i couldnt need on some green item with both.<br />
<br />
and the trading, sinds when can you trade with some1 thats not from the same realm? cos last time i tried it wasnt possible.</div></div><hr />

Listed below are recent fixes we have applied to the game. Keep in mind that some of these changes may not be active until after the realm has been restarted.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/class-warrior/) / Talent Calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?warrior))<br />
Sweeping Strikes and Bladestorm<br />
We're trying to fix the interaction between Sweeping Strikes and Bladestorm. The purpose of Sweeping Strikes is to let your attacks hit more targets, not hit the targets you are already hitting harder.<br />
<br />
[...] Bladestorm should not be able to use Sweeping Strikes to transfer all that damage to a single target. As I said above, the purpose of Sweeping Strikes is to hit *additional* targets not just cause more damage to existing targets. I believe Whirlwind works with Sweeping Strikes correctly, so we'd like to get Bladestorm to work the same way.<br />
<br />
This change will then let us see if any of the concern about Bladestorm in PvP is founded or if it's not an issue without Sweeping Strikes inflating the damage.<br />
<br />
We don't think this will be a real nerf to PvE Arms warriors, but if it chills out their AE damage in those very specific situations where there are several closely grouped adds and Arms damage skyrockets, then I agree that's a good thing. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20133929318-sweeping-strikes-should-not-affect-bladestorm.html))<br />

Yes the tricks were annoying, but it's all these one-trick ponies had.<br />
Maybe instead of doing these small nerfes to bosses, Blizz could do small buffs to the bosses through the patches.<br />
Instead of each fight being more streamlined for farming emblems, they could be made a little more fun or engaging. Anything to make the five-man game more interesting.<br />
<br />
As for the new looting system, I think Blizzard is on the right track but the execution needs some work. Maybe instead of making these broad categories based on what people used, Blizz could attach tags to each item that correlate with the classes. So instead of leather-wearing classes only being able to need leather, they can need anything else that add hit rating, etc. This may be able to help the class/specs (elemental shamans or Druids) with the problems they are encountering.</div></div><hr />

Keep your opinions about a select art-style to yourself. Not all anime artwork is bad &gt;:(<br />
<br />
The new artwork is nice, I'm not a big fan on Chi-Bis but they are rather cute (gnome :3). <br />
<br />
The new looting system is bullcrap though for others. Although I really don't know why it lets me roll need on cloth items on my druid and not all of you guys D:? I was doing random dungeons too with all people from different servers when a nice cloth belt dropped and I rolled against the mage and won. I asked first of course if it was ok and he said it was. I never roll on stuff not my armor unless I ask the persons who wear that armor first. Kinda odd.</div></div><hr />

This has to do with Gunship Battle, nothing with Deathbringer Saurfang.<br />

Incidentally, if you are getting marks faster than you can heal, one (or all three) of the following are happening:<br />
<br />
1) Your ranged aren't spread out enough to avoid blood nova.<br />
<br />
2) Your ranged fail and not getting hit by blood beasts.<br />

The new loot system needs work. From a tank point, I keep getting retarded DKs and PLDs rolling on tank gear with &quot;need&quot; simply because they can. They need to lock out any items with defense stats on them to tanks only. If you didn't click the &quot;tank&quot; box, gtfo my defense rating loot.<br />
<br />
I don't do these instances, especially the new ones (Tanking heroic HoR with pugs is not an enjoyable experience) so baddies can ninja my loot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah because there are no new players or alts that go to heroics for the gear anymore ::). It's been said a couple times, but all these bosses could have just had their abilities on timed CDs so that the people with high levels of gear can do their farm runs and the people trying to gear up still get the encounter tuned for their gear. But hey we're nearing the end of the expansion and they are nerfing some of the content for a more streamlined experience. It's nothing new, and it makes for an overall better experience in that area.<br />
<br />
I have a few issues with the loot system myself, but overall I like it. My first gripe is that my enchanters should be given the option to DE or not. Yes I know it's an old argument, and tbh I'd probably leave it on by default all the time anyway, but I should have the right to decide how my profession is used. I don't get to roll on gems/ore/herbs/lotus/furs etc, so why does my profession get singled out? Either make them all work the same or none of them. At the very least the option to toggle it in the interface is all that is needed.<br />
<br />
My resto druid managed to win a greed roll on cloth bracers that were an upgrade and I was happy/lucky. Generally I check the gear of people I group with to see what I should expect, so I have a small idea on if someone needs drops or not. I DE everything from 3.0 heroics, but the new ICC stuff I tend to check first or greed since either myself or a friend that has enchanting is almost always in the group. Usually I just do it in case it's an upgrade for someone and I happen to win.<br />
<br />
Sure it sucks to see a cloth upgrade get DE'd instead of going to your resto druid, I know the feeling. But to be honest the system is &quot;fair&quot; overall. It sucks worse as a mage/priest/warlock to need on a nice piece of cloth (especially hit) gear and see it won by the fail resto druid or holy pally that says it's an upgrade. My mage/prist/lock can ONLY wear cloth, but your boomkin can also wear leather. That means you have access to more items/upgrades than me. Limiting classes to their dominant armor type means that we all have access to roughly the same amount of gear/upgrades. This is a good argument imo why enchanters should have the option to toggle the DE button on and off. Turning it off means nothing gets DE'd and upgrades of lesser armor types can be traded instead of sharded.<br />
<br />
@Glamorous: Yeah that's nice for hit/defense gear, and it works both ways (you won't be able to roll on that dps gear), but that leads to more issues. DK tanks can't need on weapons without tank stats? What about bears, how do we classify their needs? The community has to do some of it's own policing and we can't make 100% of people happy 100% of the time. Sure it could use some improvement, but it has to be fair in all situations.</div></div><hr />

EVERYONE who doesn't Need an item immediately selects disenchant, just out of reflex (me included!), screwing people who actually need the bloody item but can't select Need due to different armor class (most prominently Moonkins needing caster cloth). It has happened several times in my heroics that items that would have been a huge upgrade for a Moonkin were dissed and there was nothing we could do about it. It just plain sucks! <br />
<br />
This goes out to everyone who still hastn't gotten this into their thick heads (apparently including Blizzard, unfortunately):<br />

Casters don't give a rat's hoot about armor rating! It's the stats that count! Just because it's cloth doesn't mean it's no-go for owls/ele, as long as no clothie needs it (oben to debate) :(<br />

That button would become the new need button basically. Enchanters especially would claim offspec on everything and then just DE said items after the run. Yes that button would help the issue of getting an upgrade that isn't of your dominant armor type instead of it being sharded, but it creates an easier way for people to &quot;ninja&quot; items.<br />
<br />
If you are running an instance that you know has upgrade(s) for you, then your best bet is to ask the player(s) of that armor class to need for you if that item drops, or if no such player is there, to have everyone pass. Sure it takes a little research and cooperation, but that is kind of what grouping is about anyway. Yeah it's not perfect, I know.<br />
<br />
Off topic: Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't mind the offset button personally because I'd probably hit it for everything unless blizz gives me the option to turn my enchanting on/off in the interface. No I'm not greedy and I don't need on items in instances that I don't need just to DE them. I just don't want to give other people free access to my profession when I get nothing in return, without the option of providing the service. I did it all the time before 3.3 and given the option I'd likely have it on 99% of the time anyway.</div></div><hr />

Has anyone been in a group with five people all in greens since 3.1 came out anyway?<br />
<br />
<br />
Sort of, to answer both questions.<br />
<br />
When I first hit 80 I was in a lot of questing and reg instance gear, so yes not every heroic was easy or cleared without wipes/deaths. Even now I get melee that like to sit in WW or stand next to each other or the tank on the stone boss in HoS etc etc. Tell me you cleared every heroic the first time without deaths or wipes ..... yeah didn't think so. Maybe if you were in full t5/6 they were &quot;easy&quot; with a good group, but since most people weren't in that gear and some of us get bad pugs/guildmates on our runs, we don't run everything perfectly 100% of the time.<br />
<br />
No groups with 5 people in greens, but yes been in a group where the other 4 pugs were in a lot of blues/greens with maybe 3-4 epics between the group of them. Half of them were tanks with dps gear or otherwise bad gear choices. And this is just since 3.3 has been out. Ret pally that did &lt;900 dps. A dk that did ~1900 dps but something like 6% of the damage done (not in a very geared group either as far as dps). Not to mention the always fun to group with 0/0/69 or 21/23/12 specs :(.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes and you didn't clear them all perfectly either, so my point is still valid. When people didn't massively out gear them, they were still hard (at least some encounters). The &quot;grouping with bads&quot; (which by the way was meant to imply both bads and people not knowing the fights and/or people that just may not be in the top 5% of the skilled players but aren't bad) is just another issue on top of the gear/difficulty.<br />
<br />
What does this have to do with anything anyway? You implied that all the bosses died instantly. That's not true, there are still a lot of people new to the game or leveling alts. This decreases the annoyance factor of the bosses for both new/alt players as well as well geared emblem runs. Just stfu already because your ignorance and stupidity shows more and more with each post.</div></div><hr />

I think the system just needs more logic put in place. If everyone that is allowed to roll Need on the armor type passes/greeds/disenchants, then the system should open the rolls to everyone. This would also count if no one that is allowed to use that armor exists in your party. <br />
<br />
It doesn't shield against ninjas or anything, but technically right now the system doesn't shield against ninjas. But what it does do is it allows the armor types that the item is intended for to have a first shot at winning it. If they don't want it, then it goes to everyone else that meets the role requirement but not the armor type requirement.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
yesterday nearly wiped because of totems on enemy ship in gunship battle :P<br />

<br />
That's odd, because I left my totems on the enemy gunship and Saurfang never touched them. I even commented on it and said, &quot;How nice of him!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Why nerf encounters that are already easy as they are?<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe it's meant to make &quot;On a Boat&quot; easier to do? I haven't personally done it, but I assume you do it using some kiting techniques to cause Saurfang/Bronzebeard to lose their stacks. Given a shorter stack duration, this would be easier to do.</div></div><hr />

I would change it slightly to allow Need rolls if you are able to use it and it is relevant (rogues still can't roll on Caster gear). but also adjust it so players who use that type of armor primarily get the priority (so if Cloth Caster gear drops, Moonkin and Mage roll on it, Mage automatically gets it).<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, there are those who believe just because they can use it means they are entitled the chance to roll over everyone else... Example being, A huge upgrade for me (priest) dropped in a raid, I rolled as well as a Holy paladin. The paladin rolled better than I did, and freaked out when the raid leader gave it to me anyway. Later that run Plate Healing gear dropped (and was actually for the same slot as the piece that dropped for me). We all pointed out that had he got the previous piece, then I would have been shit out of luck while he got to vendor the piece I wanted.<br />
<br />
Greed/Disenchant should be for when you're going to Vendor/Disenchant/Auction/Give it to an alt.<br />
Need should be for when you're going to use it, but give priority to people who it's made for.<br />
<br />
<br />
Awesome for the Ionar change. No more spending 90% of the fight standing around waiting for him to merge...<br />

Then you have Death Knights rolling need on caster cloth, and selling it back to you for 200g because it's a huge upgrade to the crap you were wearing... ask me how I know (pre 3.3).<br />

As I said, remove the armor restrictions, not the spec-restriction (i.e. only casters can roll on caster items, only melee-capable classes can roll on melee items). I think I could live with a built-in prioritzation when, for example a moonkin and a mage roll need on a cloth caster item. Just as long as the item is no longer disenchanted instead of going to someone who needs it as an upgrade.<br />
<br />
EDIT: your argument is void, really. Another clothie who can roll on the item but doesn't need it can do just exactly what the DK in your example did. There are asshats everywhere in this game, unfortunately, not only in the DK corner...<br />
<br />

Well, these days it's hard to spot sarcasm on these forums, so if you meant that sarcastically, I digress... if not, then you sir are a greedy git. :P If someone wants to equip and use an item, he should always have higher priority than someone who's just out for some crystals. 95% of all drops in heroics are dissed these days, bitching about items that would actually be of use to someone is just... sad.</div></div><hr />

Need = Highest priority. Can only roll Need if it matches your armor type and class (ie DK can't roll on SP gear) IF another player who does meet the specifications rolls need on it.<br />
<br />
For example, <br />
You are on your shaman and BoE cloth drops. The mage in the group rolls need on it. You are NOT allowed to roll Need on it because it is not your armor type, and somebody else rolled NEED on it.<br />
You are on your shaman and BoE cloth drops. The mage in the group passes/greed/DE's it. You ARE allowed to roll Need on it because although it isn't your armor type, nobody else rolled NEED on it.<br />
<br />
Greed and DE stay the same.<br />

If you wanted you could have a little window pop up after you select NEED (for something that doesn't match your armor type) saying &quot;Another party member is more eligible for this loot than you. If the item is passed on, you will be eligible to NEED on this item.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Problem with that is that you'll have enchanters / people just after cash rolling need so they end up with a better chance of winning the item.</div></div><hr />

Maybe it's meant to make &quot;On a Boat&quot; easier to do? I haven't personally done it, but I assume you do it using some kiting techniques to cause Saurfang/Bronzebeard to lose their stacks. Given a shorter stack duration, this would be easier to do.<br />
<br />
Did this with my DK alt on 10man, there was no kiting involved, nor was it needed. Then again 10 man is a whole lot easier than 25.<br />
Our 2nd raid (I think) did that on 25man aswell, using the same strategy as we did on 10man.<br />
<br />
Then again the kiting may be a valuable strategy aswell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whatever. Maybe when Blizz learns how to itemize enhancement shaman gear, I'll start wearing it. As long as they keep putting crap-ass armour penetration on the mail, and the good stats like hit and expertise on the leather, then I'm going to keep wearing the leather. I don't appreciate Blizz telling me how I'm &quot;supposed&quot; to play by forcing me to roll on certain gear, when the stats certainly aren't weighted how they should be.</div></div><hr />
