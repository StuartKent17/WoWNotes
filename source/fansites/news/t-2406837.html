Artifact Retirement Quests Available<br />
The Artifact Retirement quest is now live!<br />
<br />
<br />
Go ahead and complete the quest, it currently doesn't deactivate your Artifact weapon, that is coming later.<br />
Completing the quest grants Artifact Level 126 which puts you at 75 Concordance.<br />
This just simply upon completion moves everyone to Concordance 75 and then next week another bump, and then another. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
When you log in, you are given the quest The Speaker's Call which has you travel to Silithus and talk to the flight master of your respective faction's hub in order to get a ride up to your faction's gunship. Magni is on board with a select number of influential Legion NPCs (based on your faction) who also have Artifact weapons.<br />

<br />
Upon turn in, you will receive the quest The Power in Our Hands which requires you to speak to Magni to initiate a cutscene in which you and the other NPCs use your Artifact Weapons to drain the energy from Sargeras's sword and stabilize the wound. <br />

<br />
Future Artifact Changes<br />
Sometime around Battle for Azeroth launch, all traits and abilities attached to your Artifact Weapon will become disabled, including those from the Netherlight Crucible and your relics. Relics can still be slotted into the weapon, but all they do is increase the item level of the weapon.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/june/thumb/ripArtifactTraits.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/june/ripArtifactTraits.jpg) <br />
<br />
Just some clarification on this one but yes there should be a quest called &quot;The Speaker's Call&quot; that should begin the Artifact Weapon Overcharge. You will need to complete the prerequisite Magni quests in order to receive &quot;The Speaker's Call&quot;. When you complete this it should overcharge your artifact up to Artifact Level 126 which puts you at 75 Concordance. All of the existing traits will function until the pre patch.<br />
<br />
Take advantage of the overcharge and go take on things like the Mage Tower, Ahead of the Curve: Argus, and The Chosen that are removed when the prepatch goes live soon™. Also don't forget the usual Mythic mount drop chances that will be lowered from their guaranteed 100% when Battle for Azeroth goes live!<br />
<br />
If I'm higher than Artifact Level 126 and I do the quest, will I actually lose power?<br />
It should only affect Artifacts that are below that value. So if you're above Concordance 75 it should keep you at that Concordance value. However you might notice it jump up in a week or two<br />
<br />
This just simply upon completion moves everyone to Concordance 75 and then next week another bump, and then another. You get the picture. <br />
<br />
TL;DR: Smash everything.<br />
<br />
Thanks for making Cutting Edge a participation award, I guess..<br />
I mean for those teams that are really close(we're talking consistent ~10% pulls) this will be a bump to help but largely won't be too noticeable. At that level your concordance should already be fairly close to this(if not higher). If not but you're struggling mechanically this won't make any difference.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't call out Cutting Edge because if you're not already close to this it's still not easy to obtain. It's impressive don't get me wrong, but still not feasible for 99% of players.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mage Tower Up Until Pre-Expansion Patch<br />
Just giving some context to this! Yes it is officially up permanently until pre patch. Due to how the Broken Shore functions, the buildings will still be created and destroyed in the normal cycles however the NPC is now resistant to Legion Fel-Fire™ and will just permanently be standing there. Once pre patch hits though the appearances will be no longer obtainable so make sure you guys go get it while you have the chance!<br />
<br />
So all artifacts will be lvl 126 with mage tower up all the time.<br />
YEP! And they get stronger every week until pre patch! GO GET THEM APPEARANCES!</div></div><hr />

Ah, after 14 years one would think that it's obvious now for everyone that if something happens on US that happens on EU a day later, there is no need to state anything, anyone with some basic logics would know :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not every event in WoW happens after the weekly reset, there's plenty of stuff that happens on the same day worldwide. It's not obvious at all in the news post that this is directly related to weekly reset.<br />

No. A lot of people don't seem to understand the difference between artifact level and concordance level (including the blue poster which got them mixed up).</div></div><hr />

Looks like they're completely disconnected from their own game.<br />

With Argus/LFR, you could hit 915-920 before prepatch and get the tower done before the 17th.</div></div><hr />

Then surely your advice is BS because you know nothing about gearing at this time. You can gear in 3 weeks, though admittedly it's not going to be easy.</div></div><hr />

If you actually read it, it says we will be 126 AP, which is equivalent to 75 concordance.</div></div><hr />

I mean, yeah, the mage towers were pretty easy till now in Antorus level gear, but at least it required some effort. This is a pretty big buff and really makes the mage tower skins nothing more than an &quot;I participated in the final 2 weeks of Legion&quot; reward and not much more.<br />
<br />
If they're going to do this why even bother removing them at all? The prestige for having these skins was already VERY low by now the amount of time they left them in, now it's near zero. Just seems pointless to remove them at all now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1 week is enough to be around 920 and it makes the challenge modes not too hard to do. First time you do one it takes time to learn the mechanics anyway.<br />
<br />
With the books to 75 AP it gets even easier to do faster.</div></div><hr />

I guess they want to give everyone a chance at it. Not every player is going to have the capacity to complete them, though. There are probably more than a few handful who will bang their heads against them with no sense of tactic and never go anywhere (the ones where you have to follow certain mechanics anyway - like the healing challenges, Kruul, and maybe Xylem).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah but that's what I mean... they billed them as like the ultimate class challenge and stuff, and they would remove it before BFA to preserve the prestige.

Really? I think it is more like: If you want to do this on your alts too, go ahead.</div></div><hr />

Then I'll ask again, why bother to remove it from the game if it's not meant to have any prestige attached?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they're going to do this why even bother removing them at all? The prestige for having these skins was already VERY low by now the amount of time they left them in, now it's near zero. Just seems pointless to remove them at all now.<br />

You still get to tell new(BFA) players that they are unobtainable and amazing lol</div></div><hr />

No, I think they changed that a couple months ago where - clueless about their own game as they are - they were afraid that people might actually be able to hit that 50 concordance limit. So they increased it to 75. Now they are just setting artifact to 'full'.<br />
<br />
Absolutely loved the blue posts:<br />
<br />
&quot;What if I'm already &gt;126 Artifact level&quot;? (admittedly stupid question)<br />
&quot;If you're already above, then you will keep that level&quot;<br />
--&gt; First of all, it is mathematically impossible to even be AT 126, so above that just can't be at all<br />
--&gt; Second of all: It is technically capped at 75 concordance (126 total traits), so you can't be there even technically....<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything is freeloot now&quot;? (again, stupid question)<br />
&quot;We assume that people currently progressing Argus are already at these levels anyway&quot; ... L O L</div></div><hr />

&quot;Look at my super amazing weapon that literally everyone but you has!&quot;<br />
<br />
:P Just seems like a kick in the face for new players for no reason since it's just a participation reward :( Rather they just kept it in the game if they're doing this with it.<br />

Either make it rare and hard to get or just leave it in the game. Not a fan of &quot;You got this reward because you were there at the time&quot; things.</div></div><hr />

Nighthold normal gear or lower won't cut it. If you have no friends there is no chance to get enough gear to go over 895-900 where you have a really small chance. Most of the people have not enough skill for this anyway in this ilvl. <br />
And if you think you can fully 915 geared from LFR in 3 weeks well think again. Most of the time you get 2 items/week and you can get the same item again and you can get items for your legendary spots too. You wont get invite for normal pug raids under 925ilvl for sure. Of course as the blizzard devs say do your own group and be a leech on others.<br />

well this is true. most of people have problems with those chalenges even in 950-960 itlv :)<br />

<br />
concordance caps at 100+, not 75 - presumably we get there over the next few weeks as the blue post mentions multiple bumps in concordance after today (also explains what they mean by saying people above 75 concordance would not notice an increase today but would in a week or two)<br />

the mage tower challenges were rare and hard to get at 890 ilvl when they first arrived - why do you not have an issue with people doing them in 950+ gear for half the expansion, but do have an issue with people gaining a comparatively tiny power boost through their weapons in the final weeks before the prepatch? :)</div></div><hr />

My issue is why are they removing them from the game, if they're so determined to let everyone have them.<br />
<br />
I'm fine with them making them easy for everyone if that's what they want, but if they want to do that then keep them in the game. This &quot;enable mage tower 100% and buff everyone&quot; thing just makes no sense with their argument for removing them from the game.<br />
<br />
My problem isn't that the mage towers are easy, it's that they're contradicting themselves by making them easy but yet &quot;removing them to preserve prestige.&quot;<br />
<br />
Don't remove things from the game for no reason.</div></div><hr />

It says *Artifact Level 126 which puts you at 75 Concordance. * highest Artifact level in the world before this buff was Artifact level 91, Concordance 40.. no one was even near 75 Concordance on their main before we got this buff....</div></div><hr />

Which is why I was first inclined to think they just missed the part and made a smal mistake here, because both numbers are mentioned. But since both numbers are mentioned there is really no excuse, they don't even know their soul-less grind :p.</div></div><hr />

Last Saturday I logged in to finish leveling my Nightborn mage who was at level 101. By Sunday afternoon I had already downed KJ and Argus and was sitting at 907 item level. I did the full quest line in Silithus with a squishy mage with ease before downing Argus and getting my first legendary.</div></div><hr />

No, you can do them after Legion. But if you don't get base skin, you won't be able to get any of them on that spec (whole row in artifact forge will be greyed out).<br />
<br />
Stuff like Balance of Power, Heroic KJ, dungeons will be much less time consuming on 120 level, so it's even pointless to do them now. If you want to work on something after completing MT, go for rated BG - it will take same on 120, honor/prestige will be account wide and all honor will transfer from Legion to BfA.</div></div><hr />

Completing the quest grants Artifact Level 126 which puts you at 75 Concordance.<br />
This just simply upon completion moves everyone to Concordance 75 and then next week another bump, and then another. <br />
<br />
<br />
Does this mean we have 3 weeks of permanent Mage Tower until Prepatch?<br />
Does this confirm prepatch on the 17 July then?<br />
<br />
This would be lovely. I'm currently 14/36 on Mage Tower, and i've got all classes above 925 ilevel... I started doing the mage tower very late :(</div></div><hr />
