Would have been so damn awsum to have one, have always wanted to have one as Undead, one of the reasons I chose the class since the looks are awfull othervice.<br />
<br />
<br />
And, have they removed the 2/4 sec reduced cooldown on Overpower/Revenge and made it 1/2 or is it still 2/4 ?. Because othervice we will only have a 3 sec window to use Overpower Instead of a 5 sec window, and that sux.<br />
<br />
<br />
150% haste, is that our rating or our attackspeed?<br />
<br />
Because if it's attackspeed, can u understand how much that one does? 150% extra attackspeed for 5 sec, sure bloodlust is 30% for like 30 sec, but cmoon, this will be like 30% over 25 sec.... ok a lot less but anyway, it's sick.<br />

Yeah the 2p one sounds pretty meh, since deadly poison only ticks every 3 seconds and thus only deals damage every 3 seconds (unless it is refering to procing it and not the tick).<br />

It regenerate 2% / ticc for 3 persons in the raid, and once you hit 20% total regeneration it's auto canceled, if you dont regenerate 20% during the whole duration it ends anyway.<br />
Since you buff their Maximum mana during the regen, their total mana regenereated is more then if it had been 2% to begin with, and during the timer they recive higher mana reg from Replenishment effect.<br />
<br />
<br />
Abow that, it's a typo, I belive it should say, 1-6% every 2 sec.<br />
<br />
Hopefully that made more sence</div></div><hr />

<br />
At least 'uninspired' doesn't equate to 'bad' in this case. While there is nothing on the set bonuses for pets this time around, I'd say that having the 4 piece bonus could equate to a pretty significant DPS increase... but only if it doesn't interfere with trinkets. Which would suck.</div></div><hr />

Where the hell do you see a molten armor nerf? i see a buff there, and an even bigger buff to scaling. <br />
<br />
If 3.1 released tomorrow, Molten Armor without the glyph would give me 3.5% crit. Live 3%. No Nerfs there. For those with very low spirit that would only make their Molten give 2%, keep in mind having lower spirit make so you have more crit rating in item budget.<br />

Okay. I understand you, but still, compared to live servers, it's a nerf for mages who don't have a lot of spirit.<br />
If I'm right (I suck at maths), it's a buff for mages who have more than 551 spirit.<br />
When they said that they wanted to make spirit a bit more useful for mages, I have to admit that I didn't think about this.<br />
<br />
Btw, no robe for mages sucks balls, seriously. It's awful.</div></div><hr />

When they said that they wanted to make spirit a bit more useful for mages, I have to admit that I didn't think about this.<br />
I checked on wotlkwiki and there is apparently a change to Molten Armor glyph which gives a bonus 15% of spirit to Molten Armor conversion.<br />
<br />
Since you suck at math, here you go:<br />
Lets say you have 350 spirit (that's what my no-spirit-magefriend said she has)<br />
Unglyphed Live:3%. PTR: 1.90%. Need 552 Spirit to balance it out. <br />
Glyphed Live: 5%. PTR: 3.04%. Need 575 Spirit to balance it out.<br />
Item budget makes it so you have the missing 1.1%-1.96% in crit rating that wasnt used for Spirit.<br />
The Divine Spirit being baseline will help mages alot, along with GotW. <br />
<br />
My suspicion was some players were naively anticipating a talent that says &quot;You now get spellpower from your Spirit&quot; and salivating over the thought of having 200 more spellpower. The goal, as you say, is to make Spirit more useful, not to buff mages. <br />
<br />
I said that a proper benefit of Spirit to mages would be for it to affect dps. But I know that at least some players are hoping to get free dps out of the deal. The problem we are trying to fix here is not &quot;mage dps is too low.&quot;<br />
<br />
I said mage A (little to no Spirit on gear) and mage B (Spirit on gear) would have similar dps. Currently A has higher dps because she has no &quot;wasted stats.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just wanted to give explanations on how i understood the change because ive seen 2-3 people here and and we had a long-winded discussion in trade (yes yes, no spam, no trade, actual discussion, &lt;3 RP servers) about Spirit on mages and most people didnt like being &quot;nerfed&quot; while the arcane mages were saying they liked this &quot;buff&quot; (because we dont mind the mana regen really &gt;&gt;)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Btw, no robe for mages sucks balls, seriously. It's awful.<br />
<br />

Survival<br />
Trap Mastery (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=63458) now increases the duration of Frost Trap and Freezing Trap by 10% (Down from 20%), the periodic damage done by Immolatrion Trap, Explosive Trap, and Black Arrow by 10/20/30%, and increases the number of snakes summoned by Snake Trap by 30/60/90.<br />
<br />
<br />
This change is seriously LOL. Currently Trap mastery is a useless 41 talent point. It gives 30% increased trap duration, and summons 30% more snakes to aoe down with 1 button YEY! (freeze duration increase doesnt work in PVP). The only reason ive taken this talent is because the 30% increase on frost trap is somewhat nice, and i had 1 talent point left to spend.<br />
<br />
Then they NERF this allready useless talent into a 3 point talent. 1st i thought this was a joke, and the talent should have to get a major revamp someday to make it worthwile. I mean, from 1 talent to 3 talents for the exact same thing? <br />
Then they Nerf the frost and freeze trap duration from 30% to 20%. I lolled again. And now they NERF it to 10%. The only thing they added is that it now also affect Black Arrow..<br />
This is now a PVE talent for those hunters that spam Black Arrow, and use Immolation trap to proc Lock and Load, but for PVP this talent is beyond dead. As a pvp survival you get pushed in a sertain build pretty easily now, and dont have to make any hard choises to sacrifice a nice ability for another nice ability. It only concern me that all Surv specs in PVP will turn out the same.. bleh!<br />
<br />
Oh and when is Blizzard gonna reduce the amount of Keybindings and start combinding some of the Abilities Hunters have? So far only MORE new abilities have come, and now i have to find another key to bind Black Arrow on.</div></div><hr />

What a stupid change. Not only did they reduce the amount of mana restored from 15 to 1 percent (okay, 15 would have been absolutely overpowered) no, they turned the 5/10/15% procc into &quot;a chance&quot;.<br />
It makes no difference if you spend 1, 2 or 3 points in the talent tree. The text always reads: Your Rejuvenation and Wild Growth spells have a chance to restore 8 Energy, 4 Rage, 1% Mana or 16 Runic Power per tick.<br />
So did the percent numbers change?<br />
The new tooltip gives absolutely no clue how you benefit from additional points spent there. Why don't they just write: skill this and maybe something good will happen sometimes</div></div><hr />

With currently i meant currently on live servers. And it requires 3 talents, not 5. Up from 1! Who would want a useless 1 point talent that gets nerfed to become a even more useless 3 point talent? Seriously makes you think how Blizzard operates.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not to say those that get it haven't earnt it, I just think it would of been cooler as a much much rarer mount, like the Phoenix from Kael'thas. At least then when you see it you still have that 'Ooooooh, cool, rare mount' feel.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ah, I think you'll still get that &quot;cool, rare mount!&quot; effect, especially since arena attendance is down about 60%, meaning we'll have 60% fewer gladiators per server. And, frankly, it's kind of hard to achieve the same effect as the Phoenix when there are frostwyrms flying all around Northrend. I'm sure something much more epic and awesome awaits us in Icecrown.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, it's about time Gladiators got a reward this awesome. I'm excited. :3<br />
<br />
I want to feel bad for anyone who isn't a DK/Pally/Hunter/Warlock, but the honest truth is, if you're the best at your class, you're still going to get what you deserve. Our battlegroup has at least 2 members of each class (including druids and warriors) scheduled to get gladiator right now, and the cutoff is only going to get lower.</div></div><hr />

Other things which is strange for me, through all of this meele items shown from Ulduar bosses, huge % is with armor penetration, again its great stat but how paladins will benefit from that when great portion of dmg is spell.

Do u know what are u talking about? Don't think so. It's not like in this season u get frostwyrm and in next u get something else. And even tough paladin/dk is to strong atm, i don't think they will be that strong in future seasons. And Frostwyrm is just the thing a Gladiator deserve.<br />
And who told u that this is PvE game. I am not going to say that it is the opposite, cos it's not. True Blizzard make more effort in PvE, but don't u see that most game balancing is about PvP. And they wouldn't make that if it was PvE game.<br />
I am sure that they are going to give PvE ppl Frostwyrms too, just different color. Just as they did with netherdrake in TBC. Maybe by Rep reward or as BOS drop, who knows. But not soon. :)</div></div><hr />

That may be the case for PvE. However, not so much with PvP. Getting above 2k rating has everything to do with class comp. As a disc priest who I consider myself to be pretty decent at PvP and am sitting at 800 resilience, still no one wants me on their team. Not because of me, but because priests are just so ridiculously squishy in arenas right now regardless of resilience. This goes for other classes such as warriors and druids right now too.

Nah, it's not you, it is that paladins are superior in every single way to priests.<br />
<br />
1. better defensive cleansing<br />
2. freedom<br />
3. bop<br />
4. ranged stun<br />
5. stronger instant heal<br />
6. invincibility<br />
7. stun removal if specced for it<br />
8. polymorph protection<br />
9. way more mana efficiency<br />
10. faster heals on average<br />
<br />
It's ridiculous. Priests had a decent partner when rogues could press mutilate and deal 7k damage. Now that its ~2k, good luck with that when DKs and Rets with a healing paladin smash you/the rogue.<br />
<br />
For that matter, druids and shaman are both stronger healers as well. Blizzard seems to pretend that priests can get off heals. Even with borrowed time and PI, greater heal is a sitting duck.<br />
<br />
So nah, without mentioning &quot;squishiness&quot; we're just inferior healers and need to be carried by a feral druid or surv hunter at this point to get anywhere in 2s, or PMR in 3s. We're basically useful in 5s for pain suppression to stop the initial burst.<br />
<br />
Shrug. It's the DK/Hunter/Warlock/Paladin/Shaman show at this point. Look at the tournament server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some sets pieces seems really strong, while others are really lackluster. Mostly pleased with T8 models, but the colors do seem a little off for certain classes.<br />
<br />
Seems like they are really pushing Armor Penetration hard for Ulduar gear. Perhaps the next tier of raids will see greatly increased mob armor? Currently I'm not too excited about it again as Enhance (and I also feel for Ret Paladins); looks like Rogues, Ferals, and Warriors will really get the most out of it.</div></div><hr />

You are wrong about only balancing for PvP. Why? b/c PvP is never balanced. Do they ever ADD content for PvP after an expansion is released? No. They add PvE content. Why? Because it's a PvE game. You want a PvP game? That's what Warhammer is for. <br />
<br />
And no - the netherdrakes for PvE were not just a different color. The PvP ones all had really awesome looking armor and were 30% faster than the PvE mounts. And introducing Frost Wyrms this early before Icecrown is even out is just stupid. They should be mounts that you get from your faction, not mounts that you get from Arthas.

I agree , i mean seriously the frostwyrm is what arthas raised from the ground in the trailer in icecrown, it has to have some awesome significance in the game , if people get used to seeing in game now even before we hit icecrown then yeah its like blizz saying &quot;so much for the game progress lets give it to em now&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
it kinda spoils the game for those who were hoping to see some progress in the way the game develops, and yeah your also right about pvp not being balance, hopefully after blizz close friends and families get their frostwyrms they can start some serious nerfs to Dk's and holy pallies instead of telling us several times that they know they are op......but do nuthing serious about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Eh both Enhance and Ele shamans are getting more buffs / tweaks than rogues. The Earthbind AoE root ability in Enchance is pretty good and while Ele shamans are a bit too &quot;Glass Cannon&quot; for PvP its going to be tough giving them avoidance / anti burst abilities without making them OP. The one thing that needs to be addressed is Totem fixes.<br />

For EVER totems have been at 5 hp killable by any char in one hit this was because in Vanilla wow they were the best party buffs in the game so it balanced out. Thing is now almost ever shaman totem buff can be provided by another class in a permanent fashion making the delicacy of totems a non issue. Fixes for this would be simple A) Give totems 10% the HP of the shaman's max HP, B) Give totems a base lvl 79 stealth so they are visible to players within like 4-8 yards but you cant see the manatide totem the shaman dropped behind the pillar, C) Give all earth totems the stoneclaw totem protection buff. Any of these changes would make totems more resilient and less vulnerable to stomper macros.</div></div><hr />

Fairly blase talent to begin with, but now it can only affect 3 targets? Also, what is up with the 20% extra mana bit? The phrasing leads me to believe that it only increases the MAXIMUM amount of mana that the target has, not how much mana the target actually HAS at that point... which seems more than slightly lackluster.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is a skill not a talent. You do not need to buy into it. It does affect only 3 targets now but honestly what priest used this as a mana restore to their group? You use this when you are running out of mana yourself. What you don't see is that that 20% increase to maximum mana is HUGE. Divine hymn itself restores 3% of maximum mana. Replenishment works off of maximum mana as well. Divine Plea (which is why you will most likely be grouped with holy paladins) also works off of maximum mana. If you want to never have mana issues then try running with 29k mana when you have replenishment. The regeneration is such that you will stay above 75% the whole fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To bad while they made a decent idol for feral they screwed up badly on restoration (added spell power to our weakest spell doesn't suddenly make it less weak) and on balance (while added spell power is nice on insect swarm its not where near as useful as adding spell power to starfire). <br />
<br />
They also badly screwed up on the protection libram. If the choice is between extra block rating (which is not needed) or extra block value (which is very useful and comes from a badge libram) I have to chose block value. Also for holy, if the choice is to make a spell that already overheals for about 2-5k heal for more or making it so I can cast that heal more often (mana reduction from badge libram) I'm going to chose to cast it more often.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The majority of the players of this game have gotten tired of seeing exclusive rewards given to 5% of the population? The 5% of the population in this case is people that actually bother to try arena in this game. This one side game has managed to derail this game more than any other aspect of it and Blizzard should learn from its tournament that was dominated by DKs, Paladins and Warlocks that something is wrong with arena. My guess is they will deal with this by nerfing warlocks.</div></div><hr />

Its still shit if it target random players. As it is now its effect is controllable, you know in advance who's gonna benefit from it. After patch you're gonna replenish mana to 3 random warlock just a sec before they lifetap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its not a nerf to shadow fiend. It is a buff. If they make the shadow fiend have the same amount of health that the void walker does no one is going to try to kill it in pvp. Right now that reduced chance still ends up with some one that is hit capped destroying it pretty damn quickly. In PvE, its gaining a large amount of avoidance to anything that actually can kill it much like hunter pets and warlock pets did and will still have enough health that it isn't going down easily.</div></div><hr />

I hope so. I have been hard pressed to just throw away my emblems of valor to buy boes to sell because I kind of feel that they will end up adding new items to the EoV vendor. However, from what I have heard, you won't really need 219s to destroy Uludar on normal mode anyways so it will stand to reckon that most guilds will probably bypass this level of gearing all together anyways.</div></div><hr />

Scroll down the top 40 teams of each battlegroup and everyclass has a representation. For those classes that are a little lower on representation, it will take more skill to get the team up and it is proven it can be done, so quit with the BS of low chance of getting FW if your not a DK Warlock Pally, Because Shammies Hunters have a dam high representation across the board.<br />

<br />
I totally understand that a person with mana should be able to magae it, but as the case with paladins they overreached and went to far again. As presently composed, even when glyphed, a ret can't even think about using concecrate without being the whole fight, and concecrate is a huge portion of ret dps. So all they are doing is making ret worse off mana wise than they already are, they went entirely in the wrong direction. Nerf it for holy then, but for the love of god managing ret mana is already impossible while still trying to be competitive dps. <br />
<br />
And as a paladin who specs Prot for raids, having to waste talent points on something we have had for 4 years is just retarded. This change to spiritual attunement is totally unwarranted. Instead of nerfing holy pvp, they are slamming all 3 pve specs worse than holy pvp is beig hit. <br />
<br />
Bottom line, blizz found out what the common sense move was, and went in percisely the opposite direction.</div></div><hr />

Some of the DK talents look like the change dates back to WOTLK beta. Rune Tap cost 1 blood rune? Been like that since WOTLK shipped. Frost Fever doing damage over time?

<br />
Deadly Poison stacks 5 times, and if it applies the 1 energy every 3 seconds to each application, I'm fine with that. I already have the talent in Subtlety to restore 25 energy as a % chance each combo point and the talent in combat that lets my off-hand attacks generate 15 energy. 5 energy per 3 sounds reasonable.</div></div><hr />

Not sure what your issue here is. Conflag builds will absolutely love the 2 set bonus and the 4 set is some good as well considering most of what I do is cast Incinerate or SB. The 4 set bonus is a good upgrade on the t7 2 set bonus. You seem to be forgetting that dual specs give you the ability to have a 'trash' build and a 'boss' build. I personally like the 0/41/30 build but will be switching to 0/40/31 build post 3.1 with a 53/0/18 build ready depending on the boss and how mobile I have to be.<br />

# Paladin T8 Holy 4P Bonus -- Increases the damage absorbed by your Sacred Shield by 10%. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately none of these bring anything to 25 man raids. Glyph of Holy light still is the most valuable 'bonus' you can get (even when it is not criting). Looks like I'll be sticking with the t7 4 set bonus.<br />
<br />
10 man raids will benefit from the t8 2 set bonus combined with the forethought talisman. <br />
<br />
Why is the HoT not in synch with the CD on HS?</div></div><hr />

* Warlock T8 2P Bonus -- Increases the damage done by your Unstable Affliction and Immolate spells by 20%. [only deep destro and deep afliction have/use those while if u see the mages get all their main spells pressent]<br />
* Warlock T8 4P Bonus -- Increases the critical strike chance of your Shadow Bolt and Incinerate spells by 5%. [5% crit LOL what a f*cking joke tbh they can just stick it in there a$$]<br />
<br />
<br />
Everyone besides affliction uses Immolate. You're retarded if you don't as Demo. In 3.1 Demo will be the highest DPS anyway, so it doesn't need more help from the set bonuses.<br />
<br />
5% crit is fucking huge for a set bonus. The best bonuses in the game in TBC were T6 4 piece, and they were all 5% (ish) damage/healing to your main spell. Much better than T7 4 piece.</div></div><hr />
