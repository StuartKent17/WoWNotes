Warlords of Draenor - All Mounts Work as Ground Mounts<br />
Almost (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/444626517629218816) all mounts will work as ground mounts in Warlords of Draenor!<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/march/groundMounts.png (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/444623521310711808) <br />
<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor Flying<br />
I've already said that what we said at BlizzCon still holds true at current. If ongoing development changes this including testing, feedback, and etc, then we'll keep people informed. We are in the midst of development and as with anytime we get into it, we often will change design ideas or implementations from what we originally thought we wanted to do to what we believe will more likely work better. We will continue to discuss our ideas as openly as possible (as Alex did) and keep an eye out on constructive feedback. We will do our utmost to address as many concerns that people may have as possible while still keeping in mind the overall health and objectives we have for the game. <br />
<br />
We don't work in stone and design is a very fluid thing. We're going to keep moving forward toward creating fun experiences for as many people as possible. I said this over on Twitter and I'll say it again here- &quot;Sometimes I feel I need to say this, but game design decisions are not personal. They aren't meant to cause personal distress. We do care.&quot; We want to make sure that Warlords of Draenor (and the game as a whole) continues to deliver truly great experiences and plenty of fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
Battle.Net Launcher Feedback<br />
The fact that YOU think I need MY desktop 'cleaned up' or I can't keep it organized is pretty damned infuriating and condescending, quite frankly.<br />
I don't personally care what your desktop looks like or how many icons you have on it, or if you're able or not able to keep track of them; but icons on your desktop has little-to-nothing to do with offering a unified launcher platform. You can have the Battle.net app create a desktop icon for each game still, if that's what you want to click on.<br />
<br />
Right now each of our games is started through a launcher. The launchers help ensure games are up to date, offer functionality to launch other versions (beta/PTR/etc.), has some file management tools (repair), provide quick links to helpful resources (support), and helps bring info front and center when starting a game like patch notes, game info, news, etc.<br />
<br />
Instead of having separate launchers for each game, which are individually updated and maintained, and each of which also likely having different requirements and specifics for how it works and operates, it makes a lot of sense for us to have a single platform (e.g. launcher) that brings all the games together under a single roof, streamlines our platforms, and provides a single launcher--instead of many of them--to provide the same features those launchers always have, plus more, and additional flexibility to add features into the future.<br />
<br />
If you're launching Blizzard games now, it's quite likely you're seeing a launcher, and that's not really any different than seeing the Battle.net desktop app &quot;launcher&quot;.<br />
<br />
What the heck ever happened to just double clicking the executable and running the game. That doesn't need &quot;improving.&quot;<br />
Online games, like World of Warcraft, usually require that everyone playing use the same files and file versions to ensure content parity. If you and I are playing and the information we each hold about the game differs, it becomes exceedingly difficult for the server to reconcile how those differences play out and also how the client perceives those differences. Everyone needs to be playing the same game, essentially. To help try to make that process smoother, a launcher that starts up before the game checks file versions when starting the game. If your files are not current a patch is downloaded and installed. Additionally, we've added functionality for the launcher to download future patch data ahead of time to reduce the time required on patch day to get into the game, as well as the ability to stream game data so that the entire game doesn't need to be downloaded for new players, or those just reinstalling.<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft has had a launcher for the purposes of file version verification since at least 2003. The Battle.net desktop app is, for the purposes of this discussion, an updated launcher.<br />
<br />
However: I recommend Blizzard create a list of offline games to play specifically during patch downloads.<br />
If you used the launcher you'd have downloaded the patch data well in advance, and wouldn't need to wait.<br />
<br />
Just don't make the battle.net app mandatory in the future. I like double clicking the WoW icon from my desktop to launch WoW. Kthxbai.<br />
You can still do that with the Battle.net app. Cya.<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
PvP<br />
is tyrannical gear, for those who like it as x-mog, never to be obtainable again? strange: all other MoP pvp gear is available<br />
It will become available again on a vendor in a future patch. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/438456348359942144))<br />
<br />
Why the change to feats for PVP titles? Are they going to be permanent now or something?<br />
We've made technical changes to how we deliver rewards and we added a Feat of Strength. Titles are still temporary. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/438429141054914560))<br />
IE feats stay, but after a season you lose the title it grants.<br />
Yes you keep the achievement but lose the title. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/438441521663070208))<br />
Are the feats permanent, though? Do they stay as 'proof' of your accomplishment for the season? Or gone in S16.<br />
You will always have the achievement that says &quot;Season 14&quot; (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/438441083521859584))<br />
<br />
season 15? .............15.......I've been playing this game for too long.<br />
Yeah, we have been talking about that. The numbers are getting high enough that players are often confused about what season it is. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/438440704491003904))<br />
<br />
So if we're getting 3 new world bosses, which are dropping the PvP gear?<br />
We're still sorting that out. A lot of things are going to be different. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/438019686647623680))<br />
Also keep in mind there were multiple world bosses at MoP launch as well. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/438019825210642432))<br />
Should be a chest in a FFA zone somewhere with PvP item in it with a long respawn time.(wtbgurubashi)<br />
Agree it would be fun to so more of this sort of thing (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/438060632248573952))<br />
By &quot;FFA&quot; you mean &quot;come with the most friends so you can solo loot the chest,&quot; right?<br />
World PvP, it can be pretty mean. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/438224618306797568))<br />
<br />
any plans for fixing Wintergrasp and Tol Barad for Warlords?<br />
Not at this point. The best thing to do would be convert them to battlegrounds, but it requires significant work. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/438023758880600064))<br />
<br />
Future<br />
What happened to expanding the Darkmoon Faire? All those unused tents depress me....<br />
Me too. (Dave_Maldo (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/431992383958294528))<br />
Any plans?<br />
Yes. But my purple octopus monster hat-dropping world boss didn't make it in yet, either, so who knows when. (Dave_Maldo (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/433446148364177408))<br />
<br />
So tabards... Are they likely to get a tab? If not, can Scarlet Tabard be added to the vendor for my other toons?<br />
Maybe! And I believe the vendor only covers achievement/perma-lost tabards, not bought or mob-dropped (Heroic Harlan has it). (Dave_Maldo (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/433445708901781504))<br />

It's just a matter of enabling you to mount them everywhere (where you can mount at all)<br />
And some of the current &quot;ground mounts&quot; were quite large, too, so that's not a reason against enabling all mounts either.<br />

Soooooo phoenix mounts suddenly will sprout legs?<br />
<br />
/logic<br />
<br />
Hey, you're into logic, right? Do something for me.<br />
<br />
Get on your phoenix mount in-game. Right now. Then, shoot down to the ground on it. While grounded, move around a bit.<br />
<br />
If you did the experiment correctly, you'll see that your Phoenix hovers above the ground at 100% mount speed. It has always been able to do this, as do the vast majority of other flying mounts. Right now, there are only a few easily toggle-able code flags that prevent some flying mounts from being initially summoned in a non-flying area.</div></div><hr />

It's also still possible to just launch the WoW.exe and skip the Launcher, both old or new, unless of course there is an update available, in which case it will take you to the Launcher anyway, because, as Bashiok mentioned, you can only play with the most current version of the game. Everything else makes no sense. Even if you never purchased an expansion (which means you now have up to Cata anyway) you still play with game version 5.4.7</div></div><hr />

So, I guess while it was well-meant by Blizzard to attempt to give the people a shallow feeling of not having collected (or bought!) all those flying mounts for nothing, the tweak is pointless and doesn't change anything about the fact that the whole no-flying idea is still complete nonsense.</div></div><hr />

don't assume the wrong context with his &quot;spoken voice&quot; when addressing his post. he's simply calmly saying that the conversation has nothing to do with &quot;whats on your desktop&quot; and everything to do with the fantastic full functionality that the updated launcher has.<br />

People are being stupid. the new integrated launcher is balls deep amazing. And he already noted all the reasons why. It even gives you the options of creating the multiple direct access desktop shortcuts if that's what you want.<br />

&quot;All Mounts Work as Ground Mounts&quot;<br />
Well there goes 75% of the argument against No flying in WOD. Hopefully the endless amount of bitching ceases.<br />
<br />
Because most flying mounts look so good with their wings folded. Some look horrible like the Protodrakes (like bats on the ground).<br />
<br />
This is also pretty impractical size-wise:<br />

What you completely failed to understand is that they won't allow us to fly even when we reach level 100. They carve out a huge part of the game that actually gave people the chance to move between zones, to farm herbs/mines without having to deal with monsters and terrain. They are just making the game more frustrating and annoying by forcing people to use ground mounts only.<br />

Well, they act like that because of the hint that there might be no flying at all. Ofc, the imperative word is &quot;might&quot; and ofc it will only apply to WoW - there is still flying in Azeroth and all.<br />
<br />
But yeah, people like to whine. Like in that example where a poster finds Bashiok hostile about the battle.net app. First of all, the player goes &quot;What the heck etc...&quot; which is already an unpolite start to a conversation. And then it is made clear that you can still have your double clickable button for every game.<br />
<br />
I love that lauchner, but apparently Blizzard foresaw that some like the old way. Both versions can be used and - presto..somebody still whines? I'd be pissed off too.<br />

&quot;Ground Mount&quot; doesn't need to mean that the mount's feet (or lack thereof) touch the ground. For mounts such as the Phoenix one, you'd simply have it &quot;flying&quot; at ground level. Not ON the ground, but flying slightly above it.</div></div><hr />

He's not cherrypicking. They've said multiple times that there will be NO FLYING IN DRAENOR until patch 6.1. Read me very carefully: none AT ALL in Draenor. Who cares about flying in Azeroth and other old content if we can't fly to get to get to raids or gather mats? The intent Blizzard said very explicitly is that They'd unlock flying for the new &quot;continent&quot; in 6.1 when New/old Netherstorm or something else gets unlocked, in which flying will be disabled. We can expect every patch to have something like the Sunwell Plateau, Isle of Thunder, and/or Timeless Isle every patch, which will not allow flying until it is no longer current.<br />
<br />
NOW however, Afrasiabi is dropping hints that Blizzard would like to do away with flying altogether if they can. This is a very bad idea in my opinion. Rather than designing the game around a mechanic that they launched with their first expansion, Blizzard prefers, as per their usual, to take the lazy route and just disable it. <br />
<br />
They've always done this with certain things, like the various islands I mentioned, so it should come as no surprise that they want to do this considering even back in BC they seemed to consider flying a mistake.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's the thing, they want to remove it and a vast majority of the playerbase don't want it removed. I fear that after 6.1 even after 90% of the community ask them to bring it back, they will just come up with some secret research that people like it and it's better for the game and will remove it entirely. Which will make things ugly that's for sure.</div></div><hr />

Hey, you're into logic, right? Do something for me.<br />
<br />
Get on your phoenix mount in-game. Right now. Then, shoot down to the ground on it. While grounded, move around a bit.<br />
<br />
If you did the experiment correctly, you'll see that your Phoenix hovers above the ground at 100% mount speed. It has always been able to do this, as do the vast majority of other flying mounts. Right now, there are only a few easily toggle-able code flags that prevent some flying mounts from being initially summoned in a non-flying area.<br />

It's just a matter of enabling you to mount them everywhere (where you can mount at all)<br />
And some of the current &quot;ground mounts&quot; were quite large, too, so that's not a reason against enabling all mounts either.<br />

Because in a world with MAGIC, you need legs to move along the ground? Ever had Levitate cast on you? You can't fly can you, but you can still hover along the ground. So many people can't think laterally in this thread, it's rather depressing.</div></div><hr />

My opinion is a fact, as World of Warcraft is first and foremost, a video game. Anyone else's opinion that differs is just that, an opinion. You can get your jollies from looking at a digital forest, that doesn't change the fact that WoW is a video game. Flying does not change your gameplay, you just want to take your time, so do so.

This time, it's no flying until they decide to put it in. They're trying to force everyone to play a certain way. I don't care about scenery, or &quot;adventure&quot;, it's a video game, and I want to get from point A to point B as quickly as possible. My opinion is a fact, as World of Warcraft is first and foremost, a video game. Anyone else's opinion that differs is just that, an opinion. You can get your jollies from looking at a digital forest, that doesn't change the fact that WoW is a video game. Flying does not change your gameplay, you just want to take your time, so do so. I don't see why that view has to be shoved down the throats of people who just want to play a video game.<br />
<br />
But what do I care, I won't be paying $50 for an expansion to such an old game.<br />
<br />
Actually your opinion is not a fact, it is an opinion. Here is the actual fact: the game is whatever Blizzard want's it to be. They develop it, not you. And your mentality is what is leading to the downfall of gaming in general: &quot;All I want is to get from A to B as quickly as possible&quot; is hilarious. <br />
<br />
You want the real fact? Ok, here is a real fact:<br />
<br />
Video GAMES by definition are supposed to be entertaining. My definition of entertaining may not be the same as yours. Doesn't make me wrong. I find it actually fun to explore. That's why in games like, say Skyrim, I actually WALK to my destination rather than using fast travel. You find so many places to explore and get lost in. And believe it or not even WoW does stuff like that. Little details you wouldn't have noticed otherwise...getting lost in the zone and just...ENJOYING the atmosphere of it.<br />
<br />
So please, do us all a favor and keep your promise not to buy this expansion, we need less single-minded, self-centered, short-sighted people like you playing. Go back to playing games like Call of Duty where they basically require you to press forward to win with their half-assed on-rails single player modes and their done over and over and over and over again multiplayer modes.</div></div><hr />

Are you not even capable of blaming Blizzard for their own &quot;concessions?&quot; No, of course not. Let's not blame the company who has total control over their product, let's just blame the &quot;whiners&quot; who are supposedly responsible for a company's alleged bad decisions and put the heat on them instead because their opinion differs from mine. <br />
<br />
Put the blame where it's due. On Blizzard and their desire to make money. Don't cop out and blame it on the community when nobody is pointing a gun to Mike Morhaime's head and forcing him into making the game more profitable, more accessible, and, I'd argue, better. I also actually believe a lot of the &quot;concessions&quot; made have actually improved the game as well as made it more profitable. &quot;Concessions&quot; and poor quality are not mutually exclusive. I also absolutely believe there are lots of people at Blizzard who want to make good games, but above those people are other people who are more profit-oriented and those people are the ones with the power. Convenience and streamlining sell. If anything, blame Blizzard's greed and their lack of commitment to keeping out elements that &quot;weaken the game&quot;, don't blame people not wanting to farm entire sets of resist gear and who *gasp* like the idea of flying mounts.</div></div><hr />

It's been that way since the game came out. There was no flying in vanilla at all and some argue those times were the best of the game. Southshore vs. Tarren Mill anyone? I think they are trying to rekindle those old days when ppl actually cared about what they were doing and were down on the ground enjoying it. People get spoiled with something like flying around and they act like babies when you steal their pacifier. Most likely they'll add flying in draenor eventually but it's not like you can't fly in every zone but... <br />
<br />
How can people bitch about a single app holding multiple icons and letting you auto log into your games? It's a convenience to make things easier and even if you only play one game that's still only 1 icon you need. People need to stop looking at blizzard like they are just trying to screw everyone over. Even if it's bad decisions they are trying to do what they feel is the best. Honestly i'm kinda glad they don't listen to all the fans because this game would have probably died a long ago. I'm not pretending to like everything blizzard does especially with expanding the shop, increasing this xpacs cost compared to all previous ones, or the directions they are heading with draenor, but I still like to play wow for what it is. If most of what they said comes true with draenor there will be better times ahead. At this point i just feel bad for healers going through so many changes to start an xpac again like cata.</div></div><hr />

But back then, the world was a BIT newer than it is now. Flying WAS around in TBC and WOTLK, the expansions USUALLY hailed as the best AND the ones where sub numbers peaked. We have had flying for WAY longer than we didn't have it. <br />
<br />
Arrogance only takes you so far, most players that enjoy flying will NOT be content with the developers forcing a different way of playing on them. Most people in-game who are not frequenting forums think that we get flying in 6.1 since that is the decision that's been advertised at Blizzcon. Imagine the storm when they realise that Blizzard didn't announce planning for no flying at all in Draenor until waaaaay later, after selling several mounts with trailers hailing them as superduper flyers (the Iron Skyreaver was made in Draenor by the Iron Horde, LOL!) and a CE which was more expensive than before AND had a flyer as mount.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't care about not being able to use certain mounts. I care about not being able to fly at all! Once I've gone through the hassle of running around to level up, I want to be done with the ground so I can focus on farming materials and gearing up.<br />

It's all about costs people, it has nothing to do with gameplay or what the players want.

That's just the standard attitude of a Blizzard Customer service rep and public relations rep. That's all they do, condescend.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sure, this scenario is about the launchers, which is completely pointless and they're probably being trolled, but most of the time it's a perfectly valid question or argument and it gets met with a rude response.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;However: I recommend Blizzard create a list of offline games to play specifically during patch downloads.<br />
If you used the launcher you'd have downloaded the patch data well in advance, and wouldn't need to wait.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure they're talking about the maintenance downtime, not the time to actually download the patch. So the blue response is kind of missing the point in that case. <br />

In The Burning Crusade, you learned flying at level 70. In Wrath of the Lich King you were able to learn flight at level 77 (which was necessary for the 77-80 zones). But for Warlords of Draenor, instead of being bound strictly by a level requirement we'll also be restricted by patch.<br />
<br />
I think that's an important distinction to keep in mind.<br />

You prefer to explore by ground, but I enjoy being able to explore by flying (especially for nice views). What's to stop you from just whipping out your ground mount and taking the scenic route?</div></div><hr />

Not going to just tableflip and not play WoD at all, ill give it a go and see how it plays out - i may even find myself eating my own words if it feels like im not restricted from exploration in the zone and stuff! But going from past experiences, like TBC days of having no flight through levelling and then having flight, i found it annoying to go back to having no flight come wrath/alts to tell the truth. Pandaria has a flow to its zones, and it felt unrestricted for the most part. But i still felt there was a LOT more to rediscover when flight time came, and admittely i was hoping the same sort of feeling for Draenor. After flight came, my patience for ground mounts went out the window - ill admit to that, i became 'a spoilt child' as ive seen people dub others on here, but in essence they are pretty much giving us candy and then taking it away for no valid reason (that i can see at least).<br />
<br />
The way it seems to me is that they wanna sacrafice the time and money it would take to make the world fully accessible, by taking the easy method of stopping flight. That is how i view it, and i know many probably disagree with it. Reading the blue posts, the only thing that keeps coming to mind is that the world wont be developed enough to benefit flight. But does this not scream to anybody else about a 'flat' world (for lack of a better term)? Only see what they want you to see instead of being able to freely explore the nooks, crannies and mountaintops for yourself. Im fond of flying to the highest mountaintop in the Vale and doing all my guild stuff or crafting or sorting my banks out, transmogs, waiting for dungeons and raids to pop - or flying out to the random peaks in the Jade Forest for the same stuff. <br />
<br />
Again thats just my two cents, sorry if you disagree but each is entitled to their own opinions :) Heres to hoping that enough people are like minded about keeping flight in the game and it is brought back in an early Draenor patch!</div></div><hr />

That... is a very misleading comparison. There is a huge difference between not being able to fly until a certain level versus not being able to fly until the devs push out a patch. One restriction is entirely based upon the effort the player puts into his or her character, the other restriction takes the control out of the player's hands entirely.<br />

<br />
Flying adds a feeling of exploration. I often stop to take closer looks at something that piques my interest, or to admire the vista in front of me. I can understand your point of view - flying does mess with a feeling of scale, especially in Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms because they weren't originally designed for it - but I'm not going to use a ground mount to run to places. I'm going to use flightpoints and get up from the computer to do something else. And, come to think of it, adding flying to classic Azeroth meant that several places became much more fleshed out. Ruins of Lordaeron are particularly fascinating for me, for example.<br />

To various people commenting on the 'idiocy' or 'b*tching' over the Battle.net app which will be replacing all game launchers:<br />
<br />
I am one of those objecting to it. I am not an idiot, I'm not trolling, I am not a technophobe, and I'm not stuck in the 90's or 00's (I am far too married to fast internet and have no desire for dial-up or broadband). I just don't need the software and resent that it will be shoved down my throat in the future. Maybe if the consolidated launcher had out-of-game chat and maybe if it allowed an &quot;invisible&quot; mode, then I might want it. (Please, no comments about being &quot;invisible&quot;, that is a separate conversation.)<br />
<br />
The only time I see the launcher for WoW - and ever want to see any launcher - is when there is an update to download. Otherwise, straight to the log-in screen, type in my password (I have my account set to only need the auth code every once in a while), and I'm sitting pretty at the character select screen. I am happy like this.<br />
<br />
I understand that the 'unified launcher' has several features that many are pleased to have. That's cool. Blizzard wants to consolidate all the different launchers into one launcher for, at the very least, to eliminate or reduce extra/duplicative work. That's cool. My objection is that I, personally, don't need it and don't want it running every time. The only time I ever 'need' to see a launcher is when it's downloading an update. I don't care to see the marketing and I get all the info I need pretty much from MMO-Champion alone. :\<br />
<br />
I don't know if it's changed since last I tried out Battle.net App some number of months ago, but I have the distinct recollection that I could not directly open from the game executable even though I was 100% up-to-date. This really, really made me displeased - so I uninstalled it despite kind of liking what I saw in the Hearthstone beta. <br />
<br />
I just do not need another layer, another program that I have open and then manually close so it isn't running in the background. Does this mean I may have to spend time waiting to play because it wasn't downloading something in the background? Maybe. But it won't bother me. I have this pretty wallpaper (http://sanluis.deviantart.com/art/Pandaren-Wisdom-Slow-Down-341149635) to contemplate.</div></div><hr />

They clearly do not want flying in WoD or they wouldn't have bothered with this &quot;We want to delay putting it in the game.&quot; They know that saying something up front would be a disaster so they're hoping people will buy the expansion and commit to WoD before they go &quot;This is working out well with no flying; it's going to stay this way.&quot;<br />

I'm less offended by the lack of flying but I am offended by the way they're handling this.

I agree they need to not open the launcher at all when you right click the tray icon to launch a game and when you actually launch a game the launcher needs to close by itself. I'd think this would be something they'd change before forcing it on everyone.<br />

There is no reason to remove flying, its one of the greatest additions to this game, not being able to fly until max level in a new expansion is nothing new and is completely fine, cata was the only exception because hello, most of the content took place in old azeroth, not new areas. I could never imagine a reason why I would leave this game but if they for some odd reason they decided to remove flying all together (and I mean ALL flying, old world etc) then they'd lose me too along with half of their subscribers left. <br />
<br />
And for those of you saying you hate flying and wish it was removed, first of all, why the hell do you hate it? Are you one of those people who sits there reporting names like Healbot on RP servers because it breaks you out of the immersion? If you dont like flying, DONT FLY, if you dont like flying because people gank you, DONT ROLL PVP, don't wish the misfortune of it not even being a choice on everybody because you have your own opinions.</div></div><hr />

I don't want to use my flying mounts on ground, I want to fly on them. So, I guess while it was well-meant by Blizzard to attempt to give the people a shallow feeling of not having collected (or bought!) all those flying mounts for nothing, the tweak is pointless and doesn't change anything about the fact that the whole no-flying idea is still complete nonsense.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Puntar</div><div class="date">2014-03-16, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually your opinion is not a fact, it is an opinion. Here is the actual fact: the game is whatever Blizzard want's it to be. They develop it, not you. And your mentality is what is leading to the downfall of gaming in general: &quot;All I want is to get from A to B as quickly as possible&quot; is hilarious. <br />
<br />
You want the real fact? Ok, here is a real fact:<br />
<br />
Video GAMES by definition are supposed to be entertaining. My definition of entertaining may not be the same as yours. Doesn't make me wrong. I find it actually fun to explore. That's why in games like, say Skyrim, I actually WALK to my destination rather than using fast travel. You find so many places to explore and get lost in. And believe it or not even WoW does stuff like that. Little details you wouldn't have noticed otherwise...getting lost in the zone and just...ENJOYING the atmosphere of it.<br />
<br />
So please, do us all a favor and keep your promise not to buy this expansion, we need less single-minded, self-centered, short-sighted people like you playing. Go back to playing games like Call of Duty where they basically require you to press forward to win with their half-assed on-rails single player modes and their done over and over and over and over again multiplayer modes.<br />
<br />
Well you know this no- flying fiasco at lvl. 100 can easily tank the game, when majority of players realize that they cannot fly at all even at lvl. 100 in WoD zones.<br />
<br />
Convenience of not fighting &quot;hundreds of&quot; mobs while in &quot;transit&quot; from A to B is the main point of it. It annoy me to no end (and others also) when I get struck by a mob, de-mounted and then I need to kill and spend 15 - 20 sec to kill just one mob. <br />
<br />
It just bollock what kind of a mess have Blizard done in that regard! During leveling and up to lvl. 80+ player can two shot (4 second MAX!!!) any normal mob. After that and especially in MoP zones while leveling to lvl 90 player need to spend at minimum 20 seconds to kill just 1, ONE mob. Now imagine a horror of 2+ mobs on your mount tail, then suddenly another mob de-mount you and you need to fight 3+ mobs of the same level as you. Unless you are uber geared and very skilled along with AoE tools (or Rogue), you are pretty much dead. Even if you managed to kill all the mobs, you already need at least 1 hectic minute to dispose of them. If you are healer you probalby spend 3 times more time than a dps, but those are in most cases dead and are now probably running from graveyard in spirit form<br />
<br />
Instead of actually building the WoD zones and game with flying in mind, developers instead just disable the feature. <br />
<br />
That is just lazy approach sorry. Instead of making flying a part of the game of exploration and gameplay. Also instead of making no fly zone there should be &quot;danger zones with flying elite mobs in the air&quot; who can dismount and or kill players even in air. That way player would be more willing to stay on ground and travel on ground mounts.</div></div><hr />

It's just a matter of enabling you to mount them everywhere (where you can mount at all)<br />
And some of the current &quot;ground mounts&quot; were quite large, too, so that's not a reason against enabling all mounts either.<br />

Every mountable creature without legs will now grow a pair of legs :D I wonder if I'll be able to use my Abyssal Seahorse in BGs now, and if so, will it have a fishbowl helmet and a new grown pair of legs? :D<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm sure it'll work out just fine :)</div></div><hr />

it seems that all decisions nowadays was made by a activision prince..<br />

Your grammar is a little annoying, but I do feel there is a point buried in there somewhere.<br />
<br />
Let's make all flying mounts able to be used on the ground, instead of just enabling flying mounts to be.. I don't know... flyable? Nahhh.. that's dumb.<br />
<br />
Let's just let all of these dragons and winged creatures tuck their wings in and horribly waddle around in the good ole' grass while we look for defenseless talbuk and wolves to slaughter for no apparent reason. They're endangering the environment! I'm riding around on a giant dragon that could eat it in one bite, but let me just hop off of said dragon and spend 30 seconds throwing fireballs at it!<br />
<br />
I guess all mounts will be able to be used at all levels then? So twinks can ride dragons then? If only they would get rid of this cloud serpent gating mechanism that's been completely unnecessary for the past 2 patches so I could actually enjoy my cloud serpents on all characters. <br />
<br />
<br />
Whatever!</div></div><hr />
