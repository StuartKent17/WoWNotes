Mythic Dungeon Invitational - Welcome to the Proving Grounds<br />
The Mythic Dungeon International (https://worldofwarcraft.com/news/22862590/) (MDI), a seasonal competition that showcases the world’s best dungeon-running teams, is about to begin! An invitational no more, this program is designed so that as many people as possible can participate.<br />
<br />
The first Proving Grounds of 2019 will run from February 26 PST through March 12 PST (when the dungeons reset in your region). This is the first stage of the MDI – to move on to the Time Trials stage, all you and your team need to do is complete five different level 14 Mythic Keystone Dungeons in time during that period. That’s it!<br />
<br />
Schedule for Affixes during Proving Grounds:<br />
<br />
Feb 26 - Mar 4 - Tyrannical, Bursting, Skittish, Reaping<br />
Mar 5 - Mar 12 - Fortified, Teeming, Quaking, Reaping<br />
<br />
<br />
Once you’ve done that, head on over to the MDI sign-up page (https://mythicdungeoninvitational.wufoo.com/forms/m154hh9q1s6vx23/) and provide all the information we need to verify your runs, so we can get you and your teammates onto the Tournament Realm.<br />
<br />
The Tournament Realm will act as your kind of dungeon-running sandbox. On this realm, you will be able to create max-level characters, select your armor and weapon from a range of options, grab some potions and flasks, and build out your talents as you please.<br />
<br />
The Tournament Realm is also the place where we’ll be running the Time Trials for MDI East and MDI West, where you’ll have the chance to see how you stack up alongside the competition. We’ll give you more information about the Time Trials as we get closer.<br />
<br />
To see if you're eligible to participate in the Proving Grounds, check out the 2019 MDI official ruleset (https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/template_resource/HUUQ8ZVJYUZ11550876869874.pdf)!<br />

Three weeks is still a large window for how long we've waited. Based on the story so far alone, they would have easily been in game. It's been a very long time and I would be less disgruntled if there was an end in sight</div></div><hr />

They are/were part of curse. Curse is in for the money and will boot any &quot;fan&quot; site they host when they stop making money. The people themselves are still fans, but the network is not, well they are fans of money. ;)<br />
<br />
HOTS will also lose it's curse &quot;fan&quot; page. Just a matter of time.</div></div><hr />

&quot;business realities for Curse&quot;<br />
<br />
This is what happens when fans sell their site to businesses. Quick buck, but end of life when it's not providing enough ad clicks anymore. This is what will happen to MMO Champion too, once WoW starts to die down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's pretty short-sighted anyway, we all know Blizzard is working on &quot;Multiple&quot; Diablo projects. Abandoning it now seems like the worst timing and will make icy-veins the elephant for diablo related news. Once D4 news, or whatever else they are working on, hit they will bath in plenty of content to post about. Kinda funny how short-sighted management is, the cost to host and support a skeleton crew on diablofans until something major gets announced can't be that high for a business as big as curse. Quarterly profits &gt; long-term profit it seems.</div></div><hr />

Seriuously, I dont even get the point of these &quot;new races&quot;, they are still trolls and fat humans... Why are people so angry about &quot;not getting them NOW&quot; ? Please explain...<br />
I guess I'll level up an alt and totally forget about it, like my &quot;highmountain&quot; tauren warrior, its a tauren warrior like many others...<br />

Whoever thought that was stupid, because it was never once announced we'd get it in the beginning. They only announced Allied races and the pre purchase got you what was promised, the ones we have now. Also, they even said KT/Zand would be available over the course of the expansion as we had to earn their trust.<br />
<br />
So yeah, you were wrong.<br />
<br />
This patch has a staggered release, clearly it was meant to earn them after defeating the BfD raid so it makes COMPLETE sense we get it in the patch following it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stagger or timegate shit harder than it's ever done to keep people on the hook. Only this time they've taken a core feature that you got on day 1 from purchasing an expansion (races) and timegated that. <br />
<br />
Oh please Allied Races have barely anything to do with lore either since their actual unlock quests are a mini glorified scenario. It's simply a system in place to cash in on boosts and race changes. I didn't feel like I earned any of the 6 before them.<br />

<br />
Because races never used to be timegated. You bought an expansion and got the races up until Mists.<br />
<br />
Having more doesn't suddenly stop them from doing that. The 4 Legion ones should have been available immediately with your BFA Pre Purchase. And DI/Mag'har on day 1. Just like it's always been. It's a simple timegate metric to keep you subbed so they can use their usual BS claim of &quot;if people are staying subbed obviously the game is fun&quot; despite the fact most of that &quot;fun&quot; involves carrot on stick content.<br />
<br />
Ironically the MAU count has dropped a bit though recently so even that metric is biting them in the ass.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, the other races from other expansions gave free race changes and free boosts (boosts started in pandaria I think so this only applies to pandaren if this is the case)?<br />
<br />
I can see the problem in something being timegated, such is the case of Zandalari, but not Kulties since they started the development on them during the expansion. They should have given us Zandalari and Iron forge at the start of the expansion then mag'har /KT at 8.1.5 Seeing as the mayority of the playerbase only bought the expansion for Zandalari (I don't think so).<br />
<br />
I can't see the problem in all the claims of race change or boosts, it's your money and you spend it how you want, I certainly won't do it, but level up my KT from 20 in the times I have free with some music chilling.<br />
<br />
The ones who would do race change or boosts, would have done it the same, at the start of the expansion or now.<br />
<br />
It's just a system that is punishing in wow because leveling them up is a chore, but is it punishing? in a mmorpg? All the mmorpgs that bring a new race and don't give you an ultra fast instant gratification free leveling up experience is a cash grab shit? Or because we are in this hate train destination shit island we just point our fingers to blizzard? for making us spend our money?</div></div><hr />

Thank you. I'm not saying oh how dare they be making new music. I'm frustrated they don't have a date for a race I'm genuinely excited for. I've wanted a troll paladin for a while. <br />
<br />
It surprises me that they started development on kul tirans so late into the expac. With the fact that they made kultiran the alliance version of zandalari and all.</div></div><hr />

The only people who care are those who get annoyed by your self righteous attitude, and the person you're replying to. Why waste your time being such a terrible troll?

Abandoning it now seems like the worst timing and will make icy-veins the elephant for diablo related news. Once D4 news, or whatever else they are working on, hit they will bath in plenty of content to post about. Kinda funny how short-sighted management is, the cost to host and support a skeleton crew on diablofans until something major gets announced can't be that high for a business as big as curse. Quarterly profits &gt; long-term profit it seems.<br />
<br />
The problem for Curse here is, it's pretty obvious the next Diablo game isn't going to be an isometric dungeon crawler like D1,2&amp;3. And, it's going to be a long while before it's even announced. I get why they'd park the site and wait and see what actually happens. <br />
<br />
And, thanks to all the people who ran DiabloFans. I used your site often, with ads enabled. You guys were great. So long, and thanks for all the demonic fish.</div></div><hr />

I understand, but diablo is confirmed to get new game(s). HOTS is a dead game, it will be gone in a couple of years most likely, yet they keep that?! Seems really short-sighted and kinda stupid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Indeed, it's about the same as your sister's upkeep. <br />
<br />
Stop dreaming, at $10 you dont get more than 20-50 concurrent connections, if you have too many, the admin will contact you for an upgrade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stagger or timegate shit harder than it's ever done to keep people on the hook. Only this time they've taken a core feature that you got on day 1 from purchasing an expansion (races) and timegated that.<br />
<br />
We will have got 8 races in the space of an Expansion instead of 2 every 2nd expansion. Good lord you people complain about the most trivial shit.</div></div><hr />

who know how many year will be before a new real diablo game will be released, blizzard word are vague and that mean that all those projects are still in pre-pre-pre-pre alpha phase not even knowing if they will be effectively start a real development or will be axed.</div></div><hr />

You did enough to reply. Thanks man. I'm glad that you cared enough to do that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, it was just a money-making endeavor! Now they are closing up shop.<br />
<br />
Confirmed: fake fans.<br />
<br />
I know you are just trolling, and that is ok, everyone can express themselves in one way or another.<br />
<br />
Dfans was my home for the last 12 years as a mod, I enjoyed every minute listening to fans talk about lore, new builds, upcoming speculations, ect...Sadly, the site going down has nothing to do with fans losing faith or anything like that, we were Diablo3.com 4 years before Diablo3 was even announced, We know a big announcement is coming up and were/are pretty excited for it.<br />
<br />
I can't tell you the exact reason the site is going down, just know that the community behind the site isn't going anywhere, and will still be around in one shape or another eagerly anticipating the next announcement!</div></div><hr />

The exact reason is that you let Curse buy you and now they're not making money from ad revenue. Silly especially when there is something on the horizon. What are they gonna do? Scare Blizzard into leaking something or else they take away their biggest Diablo community support? I'm sure Curse makes a ton.... but not enough to keep this site open. Where's the uproar about these layoffs or the shutdown if no layoffs? Where's the &quot;I'm sure the CEO got a bonus&quot; uproar? Where's all the evil Amazon-Twitch-Curse hate? How everyone knew this would happen when they were bought out?</div></div><hr />

Honestly, Curse was very beneficial to us, opened up Dfans to the world, it was now a community site not just a speculation site, the fault is not with Curse.</div></div><hr />
