Otherwise the class mounts would not be class specific, which they want. As a hunter, I don't see an issue, to be honest. They want us using something other than Multi Shot for AoE. Did you not see Glaive Throw? That skill sounds A. Awesome, and B. Painful. Also, Powershot. Oh boy, Powershot. On top of this, most of the classes had a majority of their abilities weakened by 50%. Most likely due to wanting to keep DPS from not changing too much. This is apparently what they chose to do with the big crunch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As I understand it, they'll be rebalancing gear to make up for the downsized abilities so it'll provide roughly the same DPS that we've got now.<br />
<br />
The cuts to abilities is just to ensure they're not OP at lower levels without adjusting them in a way that has them being less effective at higher ones.<br />
<br />
I'm sure soloing will still be possible, don't worry.</div></div><hr />

Looking at the calculator right now... I still see Lock and Load (for Frost Traps or whatever) and T.N.T. (for Black Arrow and Fire Traps). In fact, it looks like it got buffed since Explosive Shot will do Double Damage from that proc.<br />

This was my thought as well. I would assume a situation similar to Elemental/Resto, or Balance/Resto, where you have a healer spec sharing gear with a damage dealing spec.<br />

Remember guys, the changes you're seeing are not happening tomorrow, next week, next month, or anytime in the next few months.<br />

<br />
So before you get your panties in a bunch....take a deep breath, now release...there is still plenty of time left before things happen. For the sake of the trolls, I would suggest at least waiting until Alpha or Beta before you start having heart attacks.</div></div><hr />

maybe because they're decreasing damage across the board.<br />

Just a hunch.<br />

I didn't like also the old-new talents announced for mop previously, but i think the updated (16feb) talents are better than the previous mists talents.<br />
<br />
The sheep tier is gone, which is a good change.<br />
But if you count them, there are 7 forst talents, 7 arcane talents, and 4 fire talents.<br />
I think there should be more fire talents, 6 of each would be the ideal combination, but i don't know if this is a only mage problem or happens in all classes.<br />
<br />
As an arcane mage, i dislike them because of the 6 choices i can do, there are 5 of that chooses that i choose because there is not anything better, not because i lik what i'm choosing or think it is usefull at some point. <br />

Looking at those talents, i would prefer the actual (cataclysm) model of talents to be used in mop. It's not perfect, but it's far far far better.</div></div><hr />

Copy-paste spec from wowpopular is not better.<br />
But hey, people went ape-shit over trees being reduced to 31 points, and locking people to that tree until level 69<br />
<br />
and woah, a couple of days later people had adapted.<br />
<br />
And there aren't really spec-biased talents (well, some are), but for mages you're free to take a frost talent for control. that's what they offer.<br />
arcane talents are for mana, Fire usually for AoE purposes<br />

question is what blizzard does to bonuses to one's chosen spec, probably removed</div></div><hr />

1 minute....sure :-P<br />

*Dispel Magic now has a 8 second cooldown. Mana cost decreased to 3%, down from 16%.*<br />
<br />
Okay..first it was useless due to the mana costs...now it's useless due to cooldown(sorry...if I see how many buffs enemies have then I need what: a minute just to dispell them? Wasted time).<br />
<br />
For offensive dispel: <br />
If other offensive dispels (purge/spell steal) get a cooldown as well, then it doesnt really matter.<br />
<br />
For defensive dispel:<br />
Shaman got the 8 second cd as well. We can assume druid and paladin will get a 8 sec soon(tm).</div></div><hr />

They should be streamlining the classes instead of adding very, very situational abilities that only serve to make the classes more generic. (Rogue ranged attacks? Seriously?!)

<br />
Interesting, if they choose to go the route of making Holy Paladins share gear with Retribution Paladins.<br />
<br />
Nope, that's because since intellect no longer increases the mana pool, you need a talent to get it at a reasonable level (~100K at lvl 85 with current itemization). Otherwise, you would get healers stuck with ~25K mana, which wouldn't be fun at all :p</div></div><hr />

I really love when people say stuff like this. They said the same about cata talents.

<br />
Yes but the difference is now these websites will be listing the optimal specs for each encounter in a raid rather in Cata talents where most of the time you can have one set of talents for each specialisation and barring a few specific exceptions that's the talent set you use whatever boss you play that spec on.<br />
<br />
Can't believe people still haven't thought this through yet.<br />
<br />
Being able to choose from different sets of utility opens far more possibilities per boss encounter while playing the same specialisation than you ever had before. Now you get to pick &quot;Do I want to play Fire? Frost? Arcane?&quot; then you also get to pick &quot;Fire with Talent X? Or Fire with Talent Y? Or maybe actually Frost with Talent Y would be best here.&quot; There are more options on a per encounter basis than you had before.<br />
<br />
Because right now you're picking between Fire, Arcane or Frost. The 3 builds are mostly set in stone. Picking your playstyle and your utilities separately is more choices, not less.</div></div><hr />

They said all that for the initial talent versions. The final version that ppl &quot;adapted&quot; is the current one that Blizzard took a lot of players feedback into consideration instead of just &quot;we want to do this way, deal with it&quot;. And that without talking about the lack of other MMOs to get unhappy players from them at that time.<br />
<br />
Same thing will happen with MoP talents unless they really want to test the player base will to keep playing. They love now to show off some crazy changes, so everyone will keep talking about WoW instead of paying atention to other MMOs. It's an old formula of theirs by now.<br />
<br />
Blizzard nowadays prefer to just screw any kind of balance they tried to make during a xpac to just keep this &quot;fresh&quot; feeling each new xpac (or patches now). Wich really hurts the game in the long run.<br />
<br />
And they really need to fix things harder and faster if they want to do that way, because the way it looks, they still have no clue about balancing and are going for way more problems with those talents... Classes/specs that needed a more conservative and carefull approach, they're just adding (potentially OP) &quot;cool stuff&quot; while others that needed this &quot;reckless approach&quot; to be brough more in line with the current pace of the game are way more conservative/carefull instead.<br />

why are all these DK's whining about getting 'nerfed'?!?!?!?Icy Grip: Reduces the cooldown of your Death Grip spell by 15 sec and causes your Death Grip to reduce the movement speed of the target by 50% for 6 sec ARE YOU KIDDINGME???? not to mention a fire and forget execute? fuck hero classes and this expansion.<br />
<br />
The one that will potentially not work since you just need to get back some health to avoid it? Or if it just dies (kinda normal to happen), you just win some haste? LOL.<br />
<br />
And btw... not spammable as some others? (requires death rune).<br />
<br />
Nice trade of all those dmg talents and all for a new talented little snare (that can be countered by all the new shinies from other classes?) and a weird execute...<br />
<br />
And remember... ppl will have more health in MoP... so no &quot;omg, 40k dmg! I'll be one shotted!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Nothing &quot;heroic&quot; in those changes... unlike some &quot;common classes&quot; changes...</div></div><hr />

Would be true if they didn't want to keep the dmg the same for 85. Unless they're giving way weaker gear for 86+. Like ilvl 420 for T14, lol.<br />

It seems the war that Ghostcrawler has on Retribution Paladins will still go on to Pandaria. Look at this: - Crusader Strike now does 100% weapon damage, down from 135%. - Rebuke now has a 15 second cooldown, up from 10. - Crusader's Zeal now has a 20% chance to proc off of autoattacks. No longer procs off of other melee attacks. - Templar's Verdict now does 165% weapon damage, down from 200%. - Exorcism now has a 20 sec cooldown. Autoattacks no longer have a 20% chance to activate Exorcism. - Sanctity of Battle now also affects Hammer of Wrath. The only increase in damage will be: - Guardian of Ancient Kings now has a 3 min cooldown, down from 5 min. So while Mages get Temporal things to continue their domination, the only cool new things that Paladin gets are more related to healing allies. Meanwhile, people like me who enjoy playing Ret mainly will have to get content with a secondary role or just leave. In my case, im out of the game for a month or so, and sadly i'm not coming back for Pandaria.</div></div><hr />

Really I love them. I read trough some of the comments (not all) . Some people were wondering about the +400% manapool passiv of some classes/speccs. Remember that in MoP Int will no longer increase your maximum mana, so afaik all paladins will have the same manapool (and healpaladings will have it multipled with 4). Same goes for the other Hybrids Druids/Shamans. Although this has been said so many times before : Read the notes twice . I see so many comments which complain about problems which doenst even exist because they simply didnt read it properly. Someone wrote that now everybody would have the same specc. I my opinion the opposit is going to happen. Pre MoP there was allways a cookiecutter specc or atleast 36 points you had to take and the rest for your own choice. It might be possible that the same is going to happen with the new system but I guess it will be more likely to respecc for every new encounter since the system gives all classes a big versatility. Also nothing is done yet , so if you really want to complain than wait till beta or release.</div></div><hr />

I'm inclined to agree here, to an extent. The major overhaul is long overdue, but 'nerfing' every class was not the way to do it.. I don't want to start an expansion being weaker than i was the day before it dropped, that just feels bad from a design point of view.</div></div><hr />

Now you get to pick &quot;Do I want to play Fire? Frost? Arcane?&quot; then you also get to pick &quot;Fire with Talent X? Or Fire with Talent Y? Or maybe actually Frost with Talent Y would be best here.&quot; There are more options on a per encounter basis than you had before.Firstly many of us have respecced regularly anyway - either per fight, or with gear upgrades/trinket changes or dependant on raid balance, so nothing new there.(would have been nice to have bash available as a resto druid on the LK fight in Frostmourne though :))</div></div><hr />

The level 90 Mage talents fix this issue, as all 3 of them involve massive boosts to mana regen. On top of that, you now get to choose your Arcane playstyle. You can get a no-CD version of Evocation, or drop mana runes to stand in to boost regen, or a bubble that converts damage to mana. I personally can't wait, it sounds like Mages will be a ton of fun to play in MoP.</div></div><hr />

Yeah read yourself, I see 10-15% nerfs to other classes. Hunters seem to be getting 50% nerfs across the board, a bit more then 10-15 like Rogues on &quot;some&quot; of their abilities, every main Hunter ability got whacked hard with the nerf bat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Keep in mind that this isn't even in beta or alpha yet. Besides, the reason they're most likely &quot;nerfing&quot; things this hard is so that we won't be overpowered as fuck at level 85. Just like today, percentual (is that even a word?) damage and gear itself will increase in 86-90, effectively removing the &quot;nerfs&quot; as we level.

Not to sound blunt, but...<br />
<br />
When do you get it into your heads that ALL percentages and ALL numeric values are irrelevant in their current state.<br />
<br />
Game is nowhere near done. We are not even in Alpha state yet (As far as I know). So you cannot possibly be talking about numbers at this very point having no information what-so-ever about the possible item level crunch or how the actual gear will be scaling towards level 90.<br />
<br />
For all we know those new numbers are perfect and do not need to be changed, ever.</div></div><hr />

If you happened to read the earlier Blue Post (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4063167954?page=10#190) you would know that Blizzard is 'still in development' with the priest changes and you should see some changes to priest talent tree in near future.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aerion</div><div class="date">2012-02-16, 06:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like some of the changes to Mage mana regen, but &quot;Incanter's Shield&quot; Seems extremely OP for Mage mana regen, that is unless Mages can now drain there mana in seconds. (Exaggeration here, don't freak)<br />
<br />
Considering all the level 90 Mage (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/mists-of-pandaria/feature/talent-calculator#e!) talents are mana oriented it wouldn't be surprising to see extremely high mana costs on level 90 spells. That would give those spells and mana management a whole new meaning in mage dps. It would certainly add some versatility to the mix.<br />
<br />
What comes to the &quot;Incanter's Shield&quot;, it's still in very early so it hard to make any deduction at this point. I see all the level 90 talents very viable in their own.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
However, consider these scenarios:<br />
<br />
#1 Scenario<br />
<br />
PvP | Mage plays 3vs3 Arena and is not focused, taking almost no damage what-so-ever.<br />
<br />
- That would make Incanter's Shield a total waste since you would not gain any benefit from it.<br />
<br />
#2 Scenario<br />
<br />
PvE | Mage fights a boss encounter with very little or occasional damage to the raid.<br />
<br />
- That would lead to Incanter's Shield not being destroyed at all or only occasionally being destroyed causing time to pass without the spell power benefit.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
And all this was really the point in their talent design. To make them more on-demand talents rather than &quot;I must pick this because it's best in everything&quot;.<br />

I suppose I'm then one who took it out on you, so I do apologize for that.<br />
<br />
What comes to the inventing one's own game, yeah I guess you are right. In a way WoW has lost some of it's former glory and is more or less taped/held together by the will of the people (&amp; duct tape). We are in the end creating our own fun and entertainment, more or less because the actual content patches and such are so far apart from each other, leaving periods of time totally void of any new (and potentially fun) stuff.<br />
<br />
PS.<br />

To my eye constructive criticism is kind of like looking at the both sides of the coin, not just the bad stuff. 'Even if your opinion might turn out negative in the end, you might as well embrace some of the good things on the side.'</div></div><hr />

I've always been one to hold back on the criticism and try and be constructive in all my posts, but imo Blizzard's design decisions are just getting worse and worse. For example, with this new talent build they've removed one of the better ideas they had for hunter passives,...<br />
<br />
And for those who say it's still early, there's going to be a massive overhaul, etc, you have very short memories. <br />
<br />
I was going to say that you over-looked the Blue post regarding the release of the talent calculator:<br />
<br />
<br />
•	For shaman and hunters, we still have a ways to go with the revamp of talents, and this latest calculator doesn’t have some of the changes that we’re currently working on.<br />
<br />
But by the end of your post I can see you don't believe any of it, so it probably doesn't matter to you what Blizz says at this point.<br />
<br />
I hope you enjoy GW2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's the process:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Druid will select a raid or party member and cast Symbiosis on them.<br />
The target cannot be another Druid.<br />
The target gains a buff that tells them what spell they have temporarily learned, and that spell temporarily appears in their spellbook, and they can drag it to an action bar.<br />
The Druid’s Symbiosis button will become the ability they gained from the target class.<br />
The Symbiosis link is cancelled if: the Druid clicks off the Symbiosis buff, or the Druid or the target changes continents or enters or exits an instance, or the Druid or the target changes talent specializations.<br />
Symbiosis fails to cast if Symbiosis is already active on that target.<br />
Symbiosis cannot be cast in combat.<br />
For the non-Druid target, the icon will revert to a placeholder (uncastable) Symbiosis icon when Symbiosis ends, but will become the Symbiosis-granted ability again the next time Symbiosis is cast on that target.<br />
The ability gained from Symbiosis is always something chosen to match the Druid’s specialization and the target’s combat role.<br />
The target always gets the same spell unless they change combat roles. A Druid of a given specialization always gets the same spell from each different class. If there is a change of specs, there is a change of spell.<br />

I have seen an amazing amount of constructive posts in the wow forums ,when I used to play back when, only to be deleted by forum fascists. When your ego as a dev is as large as those of some devs that make games(i would say almost all but the most humble of developers imho) whenever you see anything that seems like a slight you downplay it as jealousy, or beingmean or trolling(thats my favorite because 99% of constructive posts have been deleted under that HUGE umbrella)<br />
<br />
WoW is so freaking boring(from what I have been reading) now that players have gone to extremes. Instead of sitting in some major city trolling chat they have had to come up with a new game given blizzard has failed to entertain them. This game called ironman lol. To addicted to just quit.<br />
<br />
My suggestion, blizzard should remove entertainment from their title and just call themselves 'Blizzard...invent your own game lol.' Just a suggestion.<br />
<br />
Shamans suck and these changes insure they will suck more... Thats my constructive opinion. Take it for what its worth.<br />
<br />
Shamans are great in Pve. In PvP? Not so much, but WoW is a PvE game first and PvP second. And that's not my constructive opinion, that's a fact.</div></div><hr />

mmo champion got something very wrong here because aquatic form still has no duration in the new calculator<br />

Black Arrow - Now fires a Black Arrow at the target, dealing 1,051% Weapon damage as Shadow damage to the enemy target. In addition, Black Arrow deals 4,204 damage over 20 sec to the target and any other enemy within the path of the Black Arrow when fired. (40 yd range, Costs 40 focus, No cooldown, Instant cast)<br />

yes...I peed a little lol.<br />
<br />
The thing is though, after seeing the twilight ascendants in cata, I always wished shamans would get a CD of sorts that worked like that. The shaman would ascend to a different plane of existence (the elemental plane) and take on some of the spells and power of the elements of the associated spec. Water elementals for water, wind/fire for balance/enh either or.<br />
<br />
It looks like blizz has put the nail in the coffin for shaman tanking though :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
We were nerfed straight across the board. But black arrow now has no CD and does 1,051% weapon damage, plus the new 15% increase in damage from the new ability = 1208.65% weapon damage. Couple that with the additional AoE utilities... I think hunters will be quite viable in all encounters.<br />
<br />
But to your single target output... I still see possible nerfs once 5.0 is released.<br />
<br />
Single target rotation will be way too simple and boring though.<br />

It's tiring to see all the same &quot;Can't wait 'til (insert new MMO) comes out.&quot;. Evolve with the changes, give 'em a chance. Despite what anyone says, they DO know what they are doing. These new MMO's (I do own SWTOR, Rift, GW etc) do have their strengths but there is something about WoW that keeps so many people playing despite all the QQ on forums and blogs. All I'm saying is just wait and see. All these changes for all these classes seem pretty fun. I have every class at 85 so I am excited to play them all. Just remember, overall, that these are still being tweeked and many things may still change. Wow isn't going away in MoP. Not yet at least.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From: Blizzard Talent/skills calculator:<br />
<br />
<br />
Mark of the Wild<br />
30 Increases the friendly target's Strength, Agility, Stamina, and Intellect by 5%, and all magical resistances by [ ( Level 1-70 : (Level/2) / Level 71-80 : (Level/2 + 0.714 * (Level - 70)) / Level 81 or above : (Level + 2.5 * (Level - 70) + 3.5 * (Level - 80)) ) - 3.5 ], for 1 hr. If target is in your party or raid, all party and raid members will be affected.<br />
24% of base mana, 30 yd range, Instant cast<br />
<br />
Is that no longer &quot;actual&quot; (come MoP), Zananos? If so, where did you see that ? From all I have seen so far, Mark of the Wild remains unchanged - and if they would change it (ie. removing the resistances part) then they would ALSO change &quot;Blessing of Kings&quot; (Paladin) in the same way - neither of which I have seen or heard of, to date. Could you quote/link the source of your information, please?</div></div><hr />

Here's why: Back in 2003 Mythic wanted to do an across the board 30% nerf of everyone's dps to control burst in PVP the backlash from this was HUGE. On vnboard the screaming was literally unbearable and boom, change reverted. People don't want to feel weaker in a brand new expansion but this is really another band-aid on top of another band-aid that is already falling off. Still interested to see how they handle this.</div></div><hr />
