Legion - Sheep Staff<br />
One of the more interesting weapon models in Legion is the sheep staff. <br />

Raid Testing Schedule - April 8-11<br />
On Friday, April 8, and Monday, April 11, we will continue our Legion Alpha raid testing.<br />
<br />
Remember that Heroic difficulty scales for any group size between 10 and 30 players, so feel free to assemble and bring a group of any size within that range. Mythic, of course, requires 20 and does not scale.<br />

As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of an alpha environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the boss being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br />

FEEDBACK: Mythic/Mythic+ Dungeons<br />
With mythic + being within mythic, will there still be a way to check difficulty of dungeon within api to include plus level and all that so a mod can distinguish between mythic regular and mythic plus?<br />
Yeah, technically it's still difficultyID 8 when the run is in progress.<br />
<br />
BTW, unrelated, as some brave souls are noticing, keystone level 6 is very, very hard at this gear level. Looks like the first affix combo up is Tyrannical+Decay, which is a particularly difficult combo to try to brute-force while undergeared.<br />
<br />
One of the aspects of this new Mythic+ design is the replayability. If your &quot;Keystone&quot; gets upgraded, do you then have to do the same dungeon again on a higher difficulty? What is the window of time to complete this upgraded dungeon?<br />
<br />
If Blizzard is concerned about dungeon burnout among players (which it seems that you are judging by the WoD comments), isn't this new process going to simply accelerate that process?<br />
There are a ton of aspects to the system that aren't really exposed in this focused test. Right now, we're looking for bugs, and major issues with the affixes themselves, and the core system. Loot, lockouts, and how the feature fits into the larger scheme of endgame content will all be addressed, likely in a future blog post.<br />
<br />
To answer your specific concern, when your keystone upgrades, it will randomize to point to a new dungeon (there's a chance it could point to the same dungeon you just ran, but it's just a random roll). Part of the aim there is to vary player experience, but also to ensure that the system values a well-rounded group rather than one that is tailored to a specific instance.<br />
<br />
So, once per week lockout? I thought this was supposed to provide something to do - like grifts in diablo.<br />
Regular Mythic dungeons will have a loot-based weekly lockout, just like on live. But the keystone runs are different, and are only limited by the availability of keystones. No inherent lockout otherwise. We'll have a bunch more info to share in the near future, but the philosophical goals here consist of keeping dungeons relevant, rewarding, and replayable throughout the expansion, offering a level of difficulty that will scale to players' capabilities.<br />
<br />
Will there be a way to prevent 4x tanks 1 healer group setups?<br />
You think that group composition can put out enough damage to beat the timer? If that group composition ends up being consistently optimal, then I'd agree we have a problem. If it ends up being viable in some niche circumstances, then is that a huge issue?<br />
<br />
Right now, the system is circumventing some of the built-in progression, for testing purposes, by letting you buy a level 6 keystone off a vendor. But you don't get a level N keystone without being able to beat the timer in a level [N-1] dungeon. Getting thrust into a situation for which you are massively undergeared, and feeling like the goal is just being able to claw your way to the finish line by any means necessary and no matter how long it takes, is not a situation a normal player will experience in the live game.

Classes<br />
Just tried watching a video complaining about ability pruning, stopped after they listed the rotation as being 4 abilities.<br />
.Discussions on that topic are hard to parse, when they're so drenched in hyperbole. Makes it hard to see what's a legit issue. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/715654219693469696))<br />
its a situation where we need to have more discussions for clarity, but clarity is needed to have discussions.<br />
I don't think it's too much to ask people to give feedback based on actual abilities/testing, not hyperbole. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/715656662305128452))<br />
&quot;I want a more complex rotation, not this 2 button crap.&quot; = Not very useful, since it's basis is obviously false. What's true? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/715657141831471106))<br />
&quot;I want a more complex rotation, but don't think I'll be able to take the complexifying talents because X.&quot; = Much more useful. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/715657314049605632))<br />
Or &quot;I want more complexity, but even with the complex talents, it's still only 7 abilities, still want more.&quot; = Also very useful (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/715657740312584192))<br />
Rotations have been simplified a lot ...too much. All the spells that made our classes enjoyable have been pruned.<br />
See, this is exactly what I'm talking about. All that tells me is that you have feedback, but you won't tell me what it is. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/715671180880031748))<br />
I assure you, I *do* want to hear your feedback. Not hyperbole or generality; the actual feedback. Please share it with me! (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/715671641846587392))<br />
<br />
Honest question: Do you believe having a damage rotation that consists of pressing 2-3 buttons is fun and challenging?<br />
It's fun for some (mainly those *not* looking for a challenge), though not most. Different people have different preferences... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/715444165551607808))<br />
...with regard to rotational complexity. That's one of the reasons why we allow you to customize your rotation so much in Legion. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/715444683673972736))<br />
If you ever feel like you're forced to play a 2-3 button rotation, when you want something more involved, that's great to know. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/715444833863622658))<br />
<br />
meanwhile.. &quot;I don't want these complex rotations, because my old fingers don't handle them anymore&quot;..<br />
Indeed. We want to make sure there are talents that create an enjoyable gameplay experience for those people too! (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/715657874857451520))<br />
<br />
watched a stream earlier, and he complained about pruning, ... his bars were full after talenting though. #facepalm<br />
.Unfortunately, the business/politics of streaming interferes with the feedback process in this case. It's especially troublesome.. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/715658978651422721))<br />
...when popular streams campaign for their opinion based on false/hyperbolic pretexts, to get more viewers, and then viewers repeat (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/715659246470361095))<br />
The biggest issue is that we can't/shouldn't/don't ignore that feedback; there's good feedback hidden under that. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/715659610024181760))<br />

I thought MM hunters were supposed to be petless based off the Legion preview when I bought it. Feel cheated now.<br />
Lone Wolf will still be available as a talent (and will be extremely competitively tuned). Can still be petless if you like. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/715372279291592708))<br />

Please reconsider the decision to remove psychic horror from shadowpriests. It's an extremely unique and Iconic ability. It makes me very sad to hear that you guys are removing it with this next build when I don't think Anyone had complained about it or even wants it to be removed. It just feels very disheartening to see this change<br />
Which Shadow utility ability would you rather see removed? (Or do you disagree that they have too much?) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/715386281036001280))<br />
from a PvP standpoint, they should have a lot of utility since they have a lot of casting<br />
They still have *way* more than *anyone* else. Does that not still fulfill that to you? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/715388017158979589))<br />

Nostalrius Server Shut Down<br />
One of the larger unofficial servers providing a Vanilla WoW like experience shut down this week, leading to lots of discussion on the forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1975197-Blizzard-shuts-down-Vanilla-Private-Server-Nostralius). <br />
Dear community,<br />
<br />
For over a year, you have been part of an extraordinary journey. A journey back in the early days of our beloved game. A journey in which hundreds of thousands of people took part in together. Something that we had never seen before, either on retail or private servers. Together, we built a strong community, sharing values and a commun genuine interest for this wonderful game created by Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Yesterday, we received a letter of formal notice from US and french lawyers, acting on behalf of Blizzard Entertainment, preparing to stand trial against our hosting company OVH and ourselves in less than a week now. This means the de facto end of Nostalrius under its current form.<br />
<br />
As soon as we received this letter, we decided to inform the team and players about the future of Nostalrius, where we have all passionately committed our time and energy as volunteers.<br />
<br />
Nostalrius Begins PvP, Nostalrius Begins PvE &amp; Nostalrius TBC and all related servers will be definitively shutdown at 23:00 server time on the 10th of April 2016, if our hosting company keeps the server online for that long. It feels kind of unreal, but we want to continue to serve our players as we did, and the best we can in the remaining time.<br />
<br />
What will happen next? This time, we have no plan for the future, and will have to rely entirely on our community and/or the private server scene.<br />
<br />
We know the time you spent here, the guilds you were part of, and these people with whom you have shared experiences with. We know the strength of these links, and we also know that they do not need a special WoW realm to survive. However, we will still be publicly providing everything needed in order to setup your own “Nostalrius” if you are willing to.<br />
<br />
Today is also the day where Nostalrius will start being community-driven in the truest sense of the word, as we will be releasing the source code, and anonymized players data (encrypting personal account data), so the community as a whole will decide the form of the future of Nostalrius. We will still be there in the background if you want us to, but will no longer take the lead.<br />
<br />
We also initiated an open letter addressed to Blizzard, that you can read and forward (https://www.change.org/p/michael-morhaime-legacy-server-among-world-of-warcraft-community) if you want. It won’t bring Nostalrius back, but it is a way to express ourselves as a community.<br />
<br />
Nostalrius was all about the nostalgia and memories of the glorious vanilla days. We don’t know if you truly felt like it was the glory days while playing here, but we hope that you will keep good memories of the time spent here. Once again, we can all be proud to have been part of the Nostalrius journey, no matter how much time was actually spent “in-game”.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like a humble team that only wanted to deliver something most people could re-live - the vanilla experience.<br />
<br />
They did something blizzard can't/won't do, and as far as I know, they didn't make any money off of running their emulated server.<br />

People cant apply to me &quot;the game was shit back then&quot; the harder and more complex a thing is its more fun for me . I will always play blizzard because i love to follow lore and quest and since i started on warcraft 3 ROC i love the whole game . But i aint defending free servers also , blizzard are the creators and owners , they can do what they want , its just too bad because they have the files and everything and keep and will always refuse with their &quot;we are going ahead&quot; statements to stop us from enjoying what we really wanted in the game :) But for me personally these days wow became more of single player i just enjoy the new content and once its over i'm out :)<br />
<br />
The sad part here is blizzard usually dont care about private servers , but as they grow and people enjoy that content more and as we see current player-base going down and down , they just want to somehow keep decent number of players . Witch i cant really decide if bad or sad :D</div></div><hr />

There should be different levels of rotations based on difficulty. The higher the difficulty the higher the risk but if pulled off give better dps. We should be rewarded for working harder than a faceroll class.</div></div><hr />

Its all about their and the communities nostalgia. &quot;Our want and need to play vanilla wow&quot;<br />
They openly thank blizzard for making the game and thank them for vanilla wow but actively decided to essentially &quot;steal&quot; the game. I mean an open letter like that is nice but abit late dont you think?<br />
I played on NoS with 2 months game time and the exact moment i made my char i knew this would not last.<br />
<br />
Yea sure blizz have not been &quot;strict&quot; with a lot of other private servers and maybe they were targeting NoS specifically. They most likely arnt considering the players in this situation.<br />
<br />
But if you really love something you will unhappily let it go. Vanilla wow is gone gents.</div></div><hr />

I have a better idea: you will learn the difference between &quot;unlicensed use of intellectual property for non-profit&quot; and &quot;stealing&quot;; and after that Blizzard will recognize the demand for a service and provide it legally, or at least won't obstruct it, like many other companies do for years.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I still think vanilla was the best time by a mile. In hindsight it's easy to say it sucked because Blizzard fixed everything that was annoying back then and made it easier. But when you just came into vanilla, everything was new, you appreciated the things that sucked (for the first year or so). Vanilla in itself was very different. No flying, world pvp, world bosses that mattered, gear upgrades that really mattered, elemental protection gear, significant differences between high end raiders and dungeon players, endless lame grinds for materials to make multiple pots and flasks, and so on.. and so on.. I'll always see vanilla through my rose-tinted glasses, i don't care. For me it was the best.<br />

Oh and i LIKED legendaries dropping from a boss as a chance, it gave the extra thrill when it dropped. If it didn't drop it gave you a reason to come back. I liked that aspect.

Theft does not = loss of money or someone else profited off of the stolen item(s). It just means you took something that isn't yours without permission. Stop equating no loss of money/revenue in this situation to anything other than theft.</div></div><hr />

The biggest problem with vanilla wow or any other addon they released is the nostalgia behind it after so many years. Also nostalgia tends to blend out the bad things quite often. Series I enjoyed as kid were way more awesome in the memory and feelings I had, before I tried to rewatch them. Weren't that awesome after that ;)<br />
<br />
I started wow in early bc and it was a blast, because everything was new. You really enjoyed it and could learn and see something new. Even if I played a bc server now, I would NEVER enjoy it again as it was back then. That's the problem wow and any other new mmoprg has on the market - you saw it in some way before somewhere. Nothing special about it anymore. That's why so many, good looking mmoprgs that were called &quot;wow killer&quot; failed.<br />
<br />
I already played a lot of different free to play mmos and it's the same stuff with different graphics, basically. <br />
<br />
Also we as a commnunity changed. When I started wow I wasen't a kid anymore, but far from anything you could call an adult. Not a care in the world, easy school time. Now I'm married and have two kids and a job. It changes perspectives quite extreme...<br />
<br />
And for those players saying leveling is too easy now ... without heirlooms it takes way longer to lvl up, also if you have a group without heirlooms. Also the enemies dying so fast is because of the many different changes ingame. Not to mention - would you really like the leveling speed back from vanilla and bc? We soon have 110 ... In BC it took me with one char like 3 months excessive gaming to reach the max. - just doing quests and some instances if I was invited. Counting in my newbishnes, today I might need like 2 months. BUt for lvl 110? I call fun something different.</div></div><hr />

Precisely. This isn't theft. Nothing has been taken, and no one is being permanently deprived of their property.<br />

I think a closer analogy would be the prohibition of alcohol during the 20s. There is obviously a big interest for the product but its currently banned by Blizzard. Legacy servers would be profitable with the right business model.</div></div><hr />

That's completely next to the question and the discussion. But since you're using the same analogy: all those who say it's theft and piracy, how many of you have never downloaded shit or did something illegal (knowing the consequences). <br />

I'm not saying that they are wrong when they claim the rights of ownership.

It opened in 2009 when Everquest was a 10 year old game (WoW is nearly 12 years old now). Still going strong. SOE/Daybreak Games has known about it and never tried to get it shut down. Such a dick move for Blizzard to go after Nostralus. They really didn't have to - they chose to sick the lawyers on them.<br />
<br />
800 players strong? Ok then. I doubt Daybreak or SOE care about a server with 800 players.<br />

Sure the game was new and all that, but it was that people talked and communicated with each other rather how it is today where people barely says &quot;hi&quot;. That's the thing that i miss most about the older expansions. On Nos, the same sort of communication between players occurs. Sure the &quot;harder&quot; leveling and healers running out of mana after every other pull is a different experience, but the key element from vanilla,tbc and partly wotlk, is still that we had server communities and people interacted with each other rather than acting like raging kids from League of Legends....<br />

In the end i hope that Blizzard actually understand what they need to do to fix retail WoW, Legion will at least be my last expansion if they manage to **** it up again</div></div><hr />

While that may be true, there is nothing morally wrong with Blizzard's stance. Financially they could certainly swing it but I get why they don't make a product that only a small number of people would use. Ultimately they are a business and that would be a dumb business decision.<br />

And did what with it? Turned exactly $0 in profit? Big deal.<br />
<br />
The only difference that makes is the kinds of compensation Blizzard can sue for.<br />
<br />
Copyright infringement is not conditional. YOU CANNOT USE IT. Period. <br />
<br />
If I xerox the Harry Potter books and give them away online, her publisher is not going to sit there and say &quot;Oh, no profits - carry on!&quot; <br />
<br />
See, in the adult world, laws have meaning, and repercussions. &quot;I WANT&quot; means nothing, if you don't have the rights or permission. Profit is secondary to the infringement. <br />
<br />
It's hilarious and pathetic and really soul killing watching all of you illegal-server kids make these preposterous claims to justify doing what you're not allowed to. Your moral bankruptcy isn't surprising, given our society, but your determination to justify your actions, and couching them as a 'right&quot;, and twisting and perverting morality to justify it is just....filthy.</div></div><hr />

It just means you took something that isn't yours without permission. Stop equating no loss of money/revenue in this situation to anything other than theft.<br />
<br />
The correct word is &quot;infringement&quot;. Infringement is not always theft, in a legal sense - theft has a distinct meaning in legal terms, and copyright violations don't always conform. Infringement is still a valid legal term of a law being broken however, it doesn't diminish the severity of the issue. <br />
<br />
The real issue here is that there was a copyright infringement. That's all that needs to happen, Blizzard has grounds to sue. The money aspect comes into play in terms of compensation as part of the lawsuit. If you steal my t-shirt design and give it away, I can still tell you to stop - but I can't sue for damages, as there are none. If you sell them, then i can claim your profits as damages. (If it's a physical copy, and you sell them, then it becomes a counterfeit case, with potential criminal charges.) It's a bit more complicated than that, but that's the TL;DR version.<br />
<br />
The only thing greater than the hilarity of the illegal server shutdown comments is the massive, widespread sheer ignorance of copyright laws. But pointing that out won't stop the flood of butthurt over it - they'll just move the goalposts and snivel over the new goal.<br />
<br />

<br />
It's not theft. Nothing was stolen.<br />
<br />
You're right. There was no theft.<br />
<br />
But there WAS a copyright infringement, and that's illegal. <br />
<br />
See how the real world works?<br />

<br />
<br />
they should just bring the server up again in a country without a legal treaty with the us. then blizz can`t do a god damn thing with their problem. would get them what they deserve rather nicely<br />
<br />
Good luck with that - almost every country in the world belongs to the WIPO, which gives Blizzard the jurisdiction to sue. But, i hear there are some small countries in Africa, run by warlords, who don't recognize the WIPO, I'm sure they'll love to take your money. Or, North Korea. <br />
<br />
See, the adult world has laws, to prevent exactly what you're demanding. &quot;I want free shit&quot; has been dealt with, with copyright laws and treaties.<br />

Irrelevant. Their server allowed you access to Blizzard's IP, which is a copyright violation. Thus, illegal. <br />
<br />
If that server allowed access to a game they designed, there'd be no problem. Accessing Blizzard's game? Not allowed, by law. Their (Blizzard's) authentication servers are the only legal way to play World of Warcraft, by buying a subscription, or creating a trial account.<br />
<br />
Just give it up. Even that server's owners admit they were breaking the law. Trying to find loopholes or poor logic to justify it is pointless.</div></div><hr />

I think Blizzard doesn't want to open up Vanilla servers since they might be more popular than the current game.<br />
<br />
Also the devs trying to use big words to justify the dumbing down of the game more is ever so funny, screw these devs and screw Blizzard, I've lost all respect for this once great company that use to care about their IPs. Blizzard don't care about WoW anymore and i wish another MMO with passion would come along and sweep me off my feet. Up until the end of TBC WoW had a sense of community that i was proud to be a part of, i knew a lot of people on my server for me being a good Resto Shaman now people don't care who anyone is. People log on and sit in queues all day without going into the real world, or as i like to call it the &quot;instant gratification generation&quot; Oh this is too hard, or it takes too long, stop the QQ and harden the fuck up. Sick of the vocal minority, all ways ruin it for the majority. Blizzard need to get of this bullshit call order halls aka garrisons 2.0, more so the shitty follower system and be done with the fackbook shit.

I still don't get the appeal of a classic server. Where you have only warrior tanks, Priest/druid healers and the only real dps are mages, locks, rogues, hunters. Shaman and Pallys are there just to buff and spam a heal in a raid. Horde only have Shaman and Alliance Pallys. No flying mounts. What do you do? Just run MC, BLW, Ony, and AQ over and over again? <br />

1) MMO-Champion is a gaming news web site with primary focus on Blizzard Entertainment properties, particularly World of Warcraft. It would have been very eyebrow-raising if the web site avoided mention of the story when even non-gaming news outlets have picked up on the story.<br />
<br />
2) I can't stop giggling. Blizzard has disliked MMO-C for several years, and has demonstrated it in ways that outsiders rarely have opportunity to witness for themselves. If you were &quot;a part of Blizz&quot; and in a position to make that decision, there would be little difference in the love-hate relationship.</div></div><hr />

He's sort of right. He's a fool. He honestly thought giving alpha access to streams and expecting free marketing AND feedback without bias?<br />
Sorry buddy, few things in this world are free. I'd be siding with him if, and only if, they didn't prioritize streamers.<br />
<br />
They wanted free marketing more than feedback and they got exactly what they asked for but it wasn't what they wanted. This is something children learn early in life and many people continually are forced to re-learn when they try and take advantage of others to get something for nothing.<br />
<br />
So while he's right *technically*, I have no sympathy because he was a fool to not see this happen given the client base they handed it out to. am I being harsh? Yes. Am I being too harsh? I don't think so.<br />

It's Blizzards fault for people wanting a more NOStalgic WoW experience and i cannot blame them, the game is a shadow of its former self. I think Blizzard doesn't want to open up Vanilla servers since they might be more popular than the current game.<br />
<br />
Also the devs trying to use big words to justify the dumbing down of the game more is ever so funny, screw these devs and screw Blizzard, I've lost all respect for this once great company that use to care about their IPs. Blizzard don't care about WoW anymore and i wish another MMO with passion would come along and sweep me off my feet. Up until the end of TBC WoW had a sense of community that i was proud to be a part of, i knew a lot of people on my server for me being a good Resto Shaman now people don't care who anyone is. People log on and sit in queues all day without going into the real world, or as i like to call it the &quot;instant gratification generation&quot; Oh this is too hard, or it takes too long, stop the QQ and harden the fuck up. Sick of the vocal minority, all ways ruin it for the majority. Blizzard need to get of this bullshit call order halls aka garrisons 2.0, more so the shitty follower system and be done with the fackbook shit. Make daily quest hubs and less clicking on a UI, it's a damn MMO not a facebook game for crying out loud.<br />
<br />
/Get off my Lawn<br />

Edit: Also that sheep staff is the best idea Blizzard has come up with in years, i vote who ever came up with that idea needs to be Lead Developer for WoW.<br />

The real problem is the MMO genre as a whole is dying. No MMO has ever gotten close to WoW's numbers, and of course their numbers are falling. Stuff like EQNext get cancelled before they can actually release is also quite telling. People don't want that soul crushing grind back, and those that do, only want it for nostalgia and only from classic WoW given how quick Wildstar failed. The days of the MMO are long since gone. Every other option on the market came and failed and had to resort to F2P status besides FFXIV, and that really only has players because of it's ties to Final Fantasy. <br />
<br />
Should Blizzard open up legacy servers they'd get some people joining because of hype and nostalgia, but I don't feel that it'll be anywhere close to as popular as the people who want it seem to believe. It will never get close to old Vanilla numbers.</div></div><hr />

Yup and people are still trying to claim &quot;it's not theft&quot; to make up some desperate delusion that nothing wrong was going on. Amusing.<br />

On FF14's note. It really doesn't need an EU/US playerbase to stay afloat because it has a popularity in Japan. That's why 11 is still going with a sub model because of the dedicated Japanese playerbase.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
<br />
The only difference that makes is the kinds of compensation Blizzard can sue for.<br />
<br />
Copyright infringement is not conditional. YOU CANNOT USE IT. Period. <br />
<br />
If I xerox the Harry Potter books and give them away online, her publisher is not going to sit there and say &quot;Oh, no profits - carry on!&quot; <br />
<br />
See, in the adult world, laws have meaning, and repercussions. &quot;I WANT&quot; means nothing, if you don't have the rights or permission. Profit is secondary to the infringement. <br />
<br />
It's hilarious and pathetic and really soul killing watching all of you illegal-server kids make these preposterous claims to justify doing what you're not allowed to. Your moral bankruptcy isn't surprising, given our society, but your determination to justify your actions, and couching them as a 'right&quot;, and twisting and perverting morality to justify it is just....filthy.<br />
<br />
Your Harry Potter comparison dosen't really work in this case. Blizzard were not losing any income as a result of this server. It was a group of fans enjoying a proper version of the game that isn't aimed at kids- which Blizzard are no longer offering. It would only be a threat if it was running a more recent version of the game, which is the main reason why they have the copyright protection in the first place. This protection of their copyright is farcical, as you fanboys continuously point out, the game was crap then and bares no relation to the &quot;improved&quot; version Blizzard now offer. <br />
<br />
You can carry on making your monthly donation to the Blizzard profits for fuck all, it really made no difference to you or Blizzard. If anything, Blizzard should be proud that their previous work is still so well thought of...but then its a completely different company now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The correct word is &quot;infringement&quot;. Infringement is not always theft, in a legal sense - theft has a distinct meaning in legal terms, and copyright violations don't always conform. Infringement is still a valid legal term of a law being broken however, it doesn't diminish the severity of the issue. <br />
<br />
The real issue here is that there was a copyright infringement. That's all that needs to happen, Blizzard has grounds to sue. The money aspect comes into play in terms of compensation as part of the lawsuit. If you steal my t-shirt design and give it away, I can still tell you to stop - but I can't sue for damages, as there are none. If you sell them, then i can claim your profits as damages. (If it's a physical copy, and you sell them, then it becomes a counterfeit case, with potential criminal charges.) It's a bit more complicated than that, but that's the TL;DR version.<br />
<br />
The only thing greater than the hilarity of the illegal server shutdown comments is the massive, widespread sheer ignorance of copyright laws. But pointing that out won't stop the flood of butthurt over it - they'll just move the goalposts and snivel over the new goal.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You're right. There was no theft.<br />
<br />
But there WAS a copyright infringement, and that's illegal. <br />
<br />
See how the real world works?<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck with that - almost every country in the world belongs to the WIPO, which gives Blizzard the jurisdiction to sue. But, i hear there are some small countries in Africa, run by warlords, who don't recognize the WIPO, I'm sure they'll love to take your money. Or, North Korea. <br />
<br />
See, the adult world has laws, to prevent exactly what you're demanding. &quot;I want free shit&quot; has been dealt with, with copyright laws and treaties.<br />
<br />

Irrelevant. Their server allowed you access to Blizzard's IP, which is a copyright violation. Thus, illegal. <br />
<br />
If that server allowed access to a game they designed, there'd be no problem. Accessing Blizzard's game? Not allowed, by law. Their (Blizzard's) authentication servers are the only legal way to play World of Warcraft, by buying a subscription, or creating a trial account.<br />
<br />
Just give it up. Even that server's owners admit they were breaking the law. Trying to find loopholes or poor logic to justify it is pointless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There doesn't have to be a loss of income to defend a copyright. <br />
<br />
This is a very simple concept that is lost on too many of you.<br />
<br />
Blizzard owns their art. They decide who can access it, and who can't.<br />
<br />
Profit is secondary to that. You can post all you want your theories that it didn't have an economic impact on them (which is laughably naive), but the simple fact is, they don't need to prove financial loss to defend their copyright.<br />
<br />
And, this &quot;fanboy&quot; stopped playing Wow two weeks after WoD released, because I saw then how crappy it was, and haven't touched the game since - the game hasn't been installed on my computer for over a year, and I've been very vocal here on this site that the game was damaged with WoD and that the Dev's are killing their own game. <br />
<br />
So, you can carry with your smirky little fanboy comments, but they have no impact on me, other than amusement.</div></div><hr />

Rewind to 2 weeks ago... if you mentioned this server by name your thread got shut down, and you got an infraction. Now it makes front page news? Furthermore, this note to their community and subsequent link to the &quot;open letter&quot; to Blizzard is simply a petition...
