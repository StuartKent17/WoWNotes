<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/march/mimirontank_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/march/mimirontank.jpg)<br />
<br />
Mimiron<br />
Health - 1,742M (25-Man) / 1,742M (10-Man)<br />
<br />
Phase 1 - Leviathan MKII<br />
As soon as you engage Mimiron, he jumps into the Leviathan MKII vehicle. (A personal version of The Flame Leviathan) <br />
Health - 6.97M (25-Man) / ? (10-Man)<br />
Proximity Mines - Drops about 10 mines next to the Leviathan, walking over them will make them explode for 20,000 fire damage. Avoiding them is part of the Heroic: Mind the Mines (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?achievement=2990) achievement. <br />
Napalm shell (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=63666) - Deals 9,425 to 10,575 damage in a 5 yards radius, also deals 6000 Fire damage per second for 8 seconds to anyone staying in this zone. (2 Seconds casting time)<br />
Plasma Blast (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=64529) - Deals 30,000 Fire damage per second for 6 seconds. (3 Seconds casting time)<br />
Shock Blast (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=63631) - Deals 100,000 nature damage to targets within 15 yards. (5 Seconds casting time) <br />
Rocket Strike (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=63041) - Deals 1,000,000 damage in a 3 yards radius. You have a few seconds to avoid it. (3 Seconds casting time) <br />
<br />
<br />
Phase 2 - VX-001 &lt;Anti-personnel Assault Cannon&gt;<br />
After the destruction of Leviathan MKII, Mimiron jumps in his VX-001. <br />
Health - 6.97M (25-Man) / ? (10-Man)<br />
Rapid Burst (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=64531) - Deals 3299 to 3701 damage to all the targets in a front of VX-001. <br />
P3Wx2 Laser Barrage (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=63293) - The VX-001 starts spinning and deals 20,000 to all targets in a cone in front of him. (Same mechanics as C'thun Eye Beam or Lurker Below Spout) <br />
Rocket Strike (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=63041) - Launch one of the rocket attached on the back of VX-001 on a target and deals 1,000,000 damage. You have a few seconds to avoid it.<br />
Heat Wave (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=63677) - Deals 9425-10575 fire damage and 3000 damage per second for 5 seconds to all the targets within 80 yards. <br />
<br />
<br />
Phase 3 - Aerial Command Unit<br />
Mimiron boards his Aerial Command Unit, he then flies over the raid and blasts player from here. Mimiron is untankable during this phase and will spawn adds regularly.<br />
Health - 4.6M (25-Man) / 1.1M (10-Man)<br />
Plasma Ball (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=64535) - Ranged attack aimed at the target with the highest threat. Deals 14138-15862 Fire damage. (2 Seconds casting time)<br />
Spawn Add - Assault Bot (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/march/assaultbot.jpg) - Health: 1M (25-Man) / 500k (10-Man) - Uses Magnetic Field (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=64668) that increase damage taken by 30% and immobilizes the target. These bots will drop a Magnetic Core (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/march/magneticcore.jpg) when they die. Deploying this magnet under the Aerial Command Unit will temporarily bring it to the ground and disable it. While it remains disabled, it will take an additional 50% damage from all sources.<br />
Spawn Add - Bomb Bot (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/march/bombbot.jpg) - These bots will walk through the raid for a moment and eventually explode for 9425 to 10575 fire damage in a 5 yards radius. Just avoid them, this is part of the Heroic: A-bomb-inable (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?achievement=2992) achievement.<br />
Spawn Add - Junk Bot (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/march/junkbot.jpg) - Health: 100k (25-Man) / 60k (10-Man) - Very weak adds, just DPS them down. <br />
<br />
<br />
Phase 4 - V0-L7R-0N<br />
The Leviathan MKII, VX-001, and Aerial Command Unit previously defeated merge to create V0-L7R-0N, a huge robot made of all these vehicles. You have to DPS down each section of the robot individually to kill them at the same time. <br />
Health - 50% of the total health for each section. <br />

Proximity Mines - Drops about 10 mines next to the Leviathan, walking over them will make them explode for 20,000 fire damage. Avoiding them is part of the Heroic: Mind the Mines (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?achievement=2990) achievement. <br />
<br />
VX-001<br />
Hand Pulse (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=64536) - Deals 7069 to 7931 damage in a 50000 yards radius. <br />
P3Wx2 Laser Barrage (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=63293) - The VX-001 starts spinning and deals 20,000 to all targets in a cone in front of him. (Same mechanics as C'thun Eye Beam or Lurker Below Spout) <br />
Rocket Strike (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=63041) - Launch one of the rocket attached on the back of VX-001 on a target and deals 1,000,000 damage. You have a few seconds to avoid it.<br />
<br />
Aerial Command Unit<br />

<br />
Flying Mount?<br />
According to the game files, it looks like Mimiron will drop a Flying Mount ... This is a 310% speed flying mount. <br />
Mimiron's Head - Summons and dismisses a rideable mechanical gnome head. This is a very fast construction. This construction can only be summoned in Outland or Northrend.<br />

From watching that Refuge stream it appears to have at least 2 sub-bosses (Leviathan MkII/ VX-001 (I think?)), and they look like thay had around 6.97 mil hp's each to me.<br />
<br />
Lots of nasty aoe damage too, looks quite tough. :P</div></div><hr />

That can't be right? Are you saying he has 1,742,000,000 hp? (I.e. 1,742,000k HP)?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think this fight is about killing him more so than the vehicles he controls. <br />
<br />
Or it could just be a typo and he has 1.742M HP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It's not a typo, it's just that Boubouille is French (like me) and in French 1/10 = 0,1 and not 0.1<br />
<br />
So the boss himself has 1 742 000 HP. The vehicles you have to fight have 6 940 000 HP in 25 man.</div></div><hr />

Yeah. I am aware of that. If you look at the full post you will see he has the rest of the numbers the &quot;american way&quot; (lol). So it is infact a typo.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
It could be last phase... or the actual boss itself could be the 5th (last) phase. Never know the type of resistances/defences he could have with such a low health pool.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah it's what I thought too. But in this case it will be like Sarth 3D when you have killed the 3 drakes. You know the fight is over.<br />
<br />
I think it will be fun if they do 4 hard phases with the vehicles, with the 4th one the hardest, and then a 5th phase really easy with the little guy :-)</div></div><hr />

I might stick with my Dying Curse.<br />
Sure it has 36 more Hit but you have to use Living Flame...but however it is 20 sec with 505 SP but 71 Hit with chance on cast 765 SP/10 sec with Dying Curse....What do you guys think?</div></div><hr />

Phase 3<br />
After killing his Gatling Gun you had to fight against <br />
<br />
Aerial Command Unit* 1,2mio Hp<br />
<br />
Abilities<br />
<br />
Plasma Ball on Tank ~ 10k Arkandamage in 10man-version<br />

Assault Bot 500k Hp<br />
Junk Bot 65k Hp<br />
Bomb Bot 30k Hp<br />

Phase 4 <br />

All 3 mobs together as one, but can be target everyone 4 itself<br />
<br />
LeviathanII* * * * * * * 850k HP<br />
VX-001* * * * * * * * * 850k HP<br />
Aerial Command Unit* 600k HP<br />

No Plasma Blast<br />
No Rapid Burst<br />

Burning one vehicle down ends in REPAIRING itself<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jarlyn</div><div class="date">2009-03-14, 02:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">During P3, killing any Assault Bot also causes them to a drop Magnetic Core, which supposedly you can drop at the Aerial unit's feet, causing it to fall to the ground and take 50% more damage for some length of time. Seemed to be completely bugged though, we tried twice and nothing happened both times.<br />
<br />
During P4, you get the three sections:<br />
<br />
The base (Leviathan) has mines and Shock Blast.<br />
The middle section (VX-001) has Hand Pulse (similar to Rapid Burst) and Spinning Up/Laser Barrage, but it's just focused in one direction instead of C'thun Glare.<br />
The head (Aerial Command Unit) has Plasma Ball and that seems to be it, it has it's own aggro similar to P3.<br />
<br />
They all have to be burned down together, killing any section first causes it to repair after a few seconds.<br />
<br />
We just downed it in 10-man and it's ton of a fun, it gets really crazy at the end. Got T8-10 Helm (Helm of the Wayward Vanquisher) and a Pulse Baton, which I've linked in screenshots below.<br />
