<br />
&#13; General&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Construction of the Crusaders' Coliseum is complete. Testing not yet available. New raid normal and heroic modes for the Crusaders' Coliseum can be toggled using the Dungeon Difficulty setting. This applies to 10 and 25 player versions. 10 player (normal), 25 player (normal), 10 player (heroic) and 25 player (heroic) all share separate raid lockout timers.&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13;&#13; Trial of the Champion&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; 5 player (normal and heroic mode) dungeon.&#13; Daily quest added to the heroic daily dungeon quest giver.&#13; [/list]&#13; Trial of the Crusader&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13;&#13; 10 and 25 player (normal mode) raid dungeon.&#13; [/list]&#13; Trial of the Grand Crusader&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; 10 and 25 player (heroic mode) raid dungeon.&#13; Crusaders' Tribute: Active on heroic difficulty only, the tribute system will limit players on the number of attempts the raid is allotted each week. Additional rewards can be earned depending on the number of attempts left in the tribute run each week when the final boss is defeated.&#13; [/list]&#13;&#13; [/list]&#13; Isle of Conquest, the new 40 vs. 40 player siege-style battleground is now available for testing.&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Two level brackets are available: 71-79 and 80.&#13; Defend the walls of your keep and protect your general by killing enemy players and destroying their siege vehicles.&#13; Capture the Docks, Airship Hangar, or Siege Workshop for access to destructive siege vehicles or strategic attacks on your enemy's base.&#13; Capture the Oil Derrick or Cobalt Mine for their resources to garner reinforcements and a steady flow of bonus honor.&#13;&#13; To claim victory, bust through the enemy's keep walls (or find other ways to get inside) and kill their general, or obliterate your opponents until their reinforcements are depleted.&#13; [/list]&#13; The Argent Tournament Expands&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; All new Argent Crusader daily quests and rewards have been added for players with the Crusader title. Rewards include a new Argent Crusader banner and tabard (which can port players to the tournament grounds), a mounted squire (can periodically run bank, mail or vendor errands for the player), a paladin-exclusive Argent Crusader Charger mount, and new heirloom items.&#13; All new Silver Covenant and Sunreaver daily quests and rewards have been added for players exalted with these factions. Rewards include tabards, new ground and flying mounts, and a new pet.&#13; The Black Knight returns. Follow the continued story line as the saga unfolds before you.&#13;&#13; [/list]&#13; New druid art for cat and bear forms has been added. There are now five unique color schemes for each form and faction. Changing hair color (night elves) or skin tone (tauren) via the barbershop will change the look of one's cat and bear forms.&#13; Portals from Orgrimmar and Stormwind have been added leading players to the Stair of Destiny at the Dark Portal. Once there, players can access a flight path directly from the Stair of Destiny to Shattrath.&#13; A new zeppelin docking ramp has been added to Thunder Bluff allowing Horde players easier transport to and from Orgrimmar.&#13; The local Postal Service has grown tired of walking so far each day to collect mail and have decided to install a large number of new mailboxes to Stormwind, Undercity, Darnassus and Orgrimmar.&#13; Northrend Children's Week has arrived in Dalaran! Players can find out more by visiting the Eventide District.&#13;&#13; Copied Test Realm characters will no longer be copied with their achievement history in order to better facilitate the character copy process.&#13; [/list]&#13; &lt;/p&gt;&#13; <br />
<br />
&#13; PvP&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Arenas&#13;&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; The newest season of Arena gear can only be purchased if you meet the requirements with your 3 or 5 player team rating. Rating requirements from 2 player teams can still be used to purchase the previous season of gear.&#13; Dalaran Sewers&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; The entire Arena has increased in size by 25%.&#13; Mounts can now be used in this Arena.&#13; The position and collision of the crates on the central platform has been modified.&#13;&#13; [/list]&#13; Ruins of Lordaeron&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Alcoves have been removed from the starting chambers.&#13; Two line-of-sight tombstones have been added to the slime pool on the southern side of the map.&#13; The collision around the central tomb has been smoothed out to prevent players from becoming stuck on the terrain as often.&#13; [/list]&#13;&#13; [/list]&#13; Battlegrounds&#13; &lt;ul&gt; &#13; Battleground experience has arrived!&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Players will now be awarded experience for completing objectives and actions that yield honor in Battlegrounds (honorable kills not included).&#13; Players who do not wish to gain experience through PvP can visit Behsten in Stormwind or Slahtz in Orgrimmar - both located near the Battlemasters in either city - and turn off all experience accumulation for the cost of 10 gold.&#13;&#13; Disabling experience gains will prevent a player from gaining experience through any means available in the game.&#13; Players with experience gains turned off who compete in Battlegrounds will face off only against other players with experience gains turned off.&#13; Behsten and Slahtz can reinstate experience gains for players, for a 10 gold fee of course. Any experience that would've been accumulated if experience gains were not turned off cannot be recovered.&#13; [/list]&#13; Battlemasters in major cities affiliated with specific Battlegrounds have been replaced with a Battlemaster for each faction that will allow players to queue for any Battleground. Battlemasters for specific Battlegrounds will still be seen around the cities during corresponding Battleground holiday weekends.&#13; When standing at a capture point that you control, you will gain a buff called Honorable Defender. This buff grants +50% honor gained from kills. This currently affects Arathi Basin, Eye of the Storm and Isle of Conquest.&#13;&#13; Arathi Basin&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; The time it requires to capture a base has been reduced to 8 seconds, down from 10 seconds.&#13; The game now ends when one team reaches 1600 victory points, down from 2000.&#13; [/list]&#13; Eye of the Storm&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13;&#13; The time it requires to capture the center flag has been reduced to 8 seconds, down from 10 seconds&#13; The game now ends when one team reaches 1600 victory points, down from 2000.&#13; [/list]&#13; Strand of the Ancients&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; The faction starting on attack/defense will now be randomized at the start of each match.&#13; [/list]&#13;&#13; Warsong Gulch&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; There is a now a 20 minute timer on this battleground. After that time, the team with the most flag captures wins. If this would result in a tie, the team that captured the first flag wins. If neither side has captured a flag, then the game ends in a tie.&#13; [/list]&#13; [/list]	&#13; [/list]&#13; &lt;/p&gt;&#13; <br />
<br />
&#13;&#13; Races: General&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Axe Specialization (Orc): The weapon bonus from this effect now applies to fist weapons in addition to axes.&#13; Tauren now have the option of changing skin tone by visiting the barber shop.&#13; [/list]&#13; &lt;/p&gt;&#13; <br />
<br />
&#13;&#13; Items: General&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Block Value: The amount of bonus block value on all items has been doubled. This does not affect the base block value on shields or block value derived from strength.&#13; On-Use Block Value Items: All items and set bonuses that trigger temporary increases to block value have been modified. Instead of increasing their block value amount by 100% like other items, they have all had their effect durations doubled. This applies to Glyph of Deflection, Gnomeregan Autoblocker, Coren's Lucky Coin, Lavanthor's Talisman, Libram of Obstruction, Tome of the Lightbringer, Libram of the Sacred Shield, the tier 8 paladin Shield of Righteousness bonus, the tier 5 paladin Holy Shield bonus, and the tier 5 warrior Shield Block bonus.&#13; Emblem System Changes&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Both the 10 and 25 player instances of the Crusaders' Coliseum drop a new Emblem of Triumph.&#13;&#13; Any dungeons that previously dropped Emblems of Heroism or Valor, such as Naxxramas or Heroic Halls of Stone, will now drop Emblems of Conquest instead. Emblems of Conquest can still be converted to Valor or Heroism.&#13; The heroic dungeon daily quest will now reward 2 Emblems of Triumph and the normal daily dungeon quest will reward 1 Emblem of Triumph.&#13; The existing achievements to collect 1, 25, 50, etc. Emblems of Heroism, Valor, and Conquest have been converted to Feats of Strength since Heroism and Valor Emblems are no longer attainable.&#13; New achievements have been added to collect various amounts of any combination of emblems.&#13; [/list]&#13; Mounts&#13;&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; The cast time for summoning any ground mount is now 1.5 seconds, down from 3 seconds.&#13; Apprentice Riding (Skill 75): Can now be learned at level 20 for 4 gold. Mail will be sent to players who reach level 20 directing them to the riding trainer.&#13; Journeyman Riding (Skill 150): Can now be learned at level 40 for 50 gold. Mail will be sent to players who reach level 40 directing them back to the riding trainer.&#13; Expert Riding (Skill 225): Can now be learned at level 60 for 600 gold from trainers in Honor Hold or Thrallmar. Faction discounts now apply (Honor Hold for Alliance; Thrallmar for Horde). Flight speed at this skill level has been increased to 150% of run speed, up from 60%.&#13; Artisan Riding (Skill 300): Faction discounts now apply (Honor Hold or Valiance Expedition for Alliance; Thrallmar or Warsong Offensive for Horde).&#13;&#13; In order to further equalize the number of purchasable mounts available to each race, a new 60% speed ground mount has been added for night elves, and a new 100% speed ground mount has been added for the undead.&#13; Flying over Dalaran and Wintergrasp is now possible so long as players keep a healthy distance above the ground.&#13; [/list]&#13; Mana Regeneration: All items that provide &quot;X mana per five seconds&quot; have had the amount of mana they regenerate increased by approximately 25%.&#13; Resilience: No longer reduces the amount of damage done by damage over time spells, but instead reduces the amount of all damage done by players by the same proportion. The other effects of resilience (reducing critical chance, critical damage and mana drain effects) have not changed.&#13; [/list]&#13; &lt;/p&gt;&#13;&#13; <br />
<br />
&#13; Classes: General&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; All pets now receive 40% of their master's resilience and 100% of their master's spell penetration. In addition, if a player is at their appropriate spell hit chance or hit chance maximum, their pet will be at the maximum for spell hit chance, hit chance, and expertise. If they are below the maximum, their pet will be proportionately below those maximums.&#13; Replenishment: This buff now grants 1% of the target's maximum mana over 5 seconds instead of 0.25% per second. This applies to all 5 sources of Replenishment (Vampiric Touch, Judgements of the Wise, Hunting Party, Enduring Winter Frostbolts and Soul Leech).&#13; Silence, Strangulate, Silencing Shot, and Arcane Torrent: These abilities will also apply a 3 second interrupt effect against non-player controlled targets, making them more versatile against creatures immune to silencing effects.&#13; [/list]&#13;&#13; &lt;/p&gt;&#13; <br />
<br />
&#13; http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif &lt;font color=&quot;#C41E3A&quot;&gt;Death Knight&lt;/font&gt;&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Due to significant talent changes, all death knight talents will be reset for players.&#13; Blood Strike: The bonus damage this ability receives from diseases on the target has been increased to 50% per disease.&#13; Chains of Ice: Now reduces movement by 95% instead of 100%. The main effect of this change will be that targets of Chains of Ice will not have to re-issue a movement command to continue moving.&#13;&#13; Frost Presence: 10% bonus health reduced to 6% bonus stamina.&#13; Frost Strike: This ability can now be dodged, parried, or blocked. Weapon damage bonus reduced to 55%, down from 60%.&#13; Icebound Fortitude: Cooldown increased to 2 minutes.&#13; Talents&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Blood&#13;&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Dancing Rune Weapon: This ability now has a fixed duration of 12 seconds (which can still be modified by its glyph) and a fixed cost of 60 runic power.&#13; Veteran of the Third War: Stamina bonus reduced to 1/2/3%.&#13; [/list]&#13; Frost&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Blood of the North: Reduced to a 3-point talent. Increases Blood Strike and Frost Strike damage by 5/10/15%. There is now a 33/66/100% chance whenever you hit with Blood Strike or Pestilence that the Blood Rune will become a Death Rune when it activates.&#13;&#13; Lichborne: Duration reduced to 10 seconds, and cooldown reduced to 2 minutes.&#13; Threat of Thassarian: New 3-point talent. When dual-wielding, your Death Strikes, Obliterates, Plague Strikes, Blood Strikes and Frost Strikes have a 30/60/100% chance to also deal damage with your off-hand weapon. Off-hand strikes are roughly one half the effect of the original strike.&#13; Toughness: This talent now grants 2/4/6/8/10% armor instead of 3/6/9/12/15%, placing it in line with similar abilities of other classes.&#13; [/list]&#13; Unholy&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Desecration: This talent has been reduced to 2 points for 25/50% snare and no longer increases damage done by the death knight. It has also been moved one tier earlier in the tree and its spell effect has been made more transparent.&#13;&#13; Desolation: New talent. This talent is in the position formerly occupied by Desecration. It causes Blood Strikes to increase all damage the death knight deals by 1/2/3/4/5% for 12 seconds.&#13; Scourge Strike: Weapon damage bonus reduced to 40%, down from 45%. Damage increased by 10% per disease on the target, down from 11%.&#13; Summon Gargoyle: The gargoyle now flies lower to the ground, making it susceptible to melee attacks. This ability now has a fixed duration of 30 seconds and a fixed cost of 60 runic power.&#13; Unholy Blight: This talent has been redesigned. It no longer deals damage to nearby targets. Instead, when you deal damage with Death Coil, the target will take periodic damage for 10 seconds equal to 30% of the damage done by Death Coil. This damage accumulates in the same way as Ignite and Deep Wounds.&#13; [/list]&#13; [/list]&#13; [/list]&#13;&#13; &lt;/p&gt;	&#13; <br />
<br />
&#13; http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif &lt;font color=&quot;#FF7D0A&quot;&gt;Druid&lt;/font&gt;&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Flight Form: Can now be learned at level 60. Flight speed increased to 150%.&#13; Innervate: Duration reduced to 10 seconds, and cooldown reduced to 3 minutes. This means each use of Innervate will give half as much mana as before, but it will be available twice as often.&#13; Lifebloom: The final heal that occurs when this spell blooms has been reduced by 20% on the base and on the spell power coefficient.&#13;&#13; Mangle: Ranks 4 and 5 base points reduced by about 11%. Scaling from attack power unchanged.&#13; Rake: Ranks 6 and 7 base points on initial and periodic damage reduced by about 7%. Scaling from attack power unchanged.&#13; Rip: Ranks 8 and 9 base points and points per combo point reduced by about 6%.

Scaling from attack power unchanged.&#13; Swipe (Cat): Percent of weapon damage done reduced from 260% to 250%.&#13;&#13; Travel Form: Can now be learned at level 16.&#13; Talents&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Balance&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Balance of Power: Now reduces all spell damage taken by 3/6%, rather than reducing the chance to be hit by spells by 2/4%.&#13; Eclipse: The Starfire and Wrath buffs from this talent are now on separate 30 second. cooldowns. In addition, it is not possible to have both buffs active simultaneously.&#13;&#13; Owlkin Frenzy: Now also restores 2% base mana every 2 seconds for the duration (10 seconds) in addition to its current effects.&#13; [/list]&#13; Restoration&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Empowered Touch: Now also increases the amount of bonus healing effects for Nourish by 10/20%.&#13; Improved Barkskin: No longer provides dispel resistance to all effects on the druid, but now reduces the chance your Barkskin is dispelled by an additional 35/70%.&#13; [/list]&#13;&#13; [/list]	&#13; [/list]&#13; &lt;/p&gt;&#13; <br />
<br />
&#13; http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif &lt;font color=&quot;#ABD473&quot;&gt;Hunter&lt;/font&gt;&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Aspect of the Cheetah: Can now be learned at level 16.&#13; Deterrence now has a new visual spell effect.&#13;&#13; The time that traps will exist in the world after being put down has been reduced to 30 seconds, down from 1 minute.&#13; Traps now have separate 30 second cooldown categories: Fire (Immolation Trap, Explosive Trap and Black Arrow), Frost (Freezing Trap, Frost Trap) and Nature (Snake Trap). A hunter can have one trap of each category placed at one time.&#13; Talents&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Beast Mastery&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Catlike Reflexes now also reduces the cooldown of your Kill Command ability by 10/20/30 seconds.&#13;&#13; [/list]&#13; Survival&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Entrapment: This talent no longer works with Immolation Trap or Explosive Trap.&#13; Lock and Load: Now has a 22 second cooldown. The Lock and Load effect cannot be obtained on targets immune to snare effects when Frost Trap is used.&#13; [/list]&#13; Pets&#13;&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Roar of Sacrifice: Redesigned. This ability can now be used on any friendly target to make that target immune to critical strikes, but the Hunter pet takes 20% of all damage taken by that friendly target. Cooldown increased to 2 minutes.&#13; [/list]&#13; [/list]&#13; [/list]&#13; &lt;/p&gt;&#13; <br />
<br />

<br />
&#13; http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif &lt;font color=&quot;#F58CBA&quot;&gt;Paladin&lt;/font&gt;&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13;&#13; Blessing of Sanctuary: This blessing now also increases stamina by 10%. This effect is not cumulative with Blessing of Kings.&#13; Charger: Can now be learned at level 40.&#13; Exorcism: Now has a 1.5 second cast time, but can once again be used on players.&#13; Hand of Reckoning: Redesigned. Now does damage only when target does not currently have the caster targeted, but damage done increased to 50% of attack power, occurring after the taunt effect is applied.&#13; Judgement of Light: Now heals for 2% of the attacker's maximum health instead of a variable amount based on the spell power and attack power of the judging paladin.&#13; Lay on Hands: The buff from this ability now reduces the physical damage taken by the target by 10/20% instead of increasing the target's armor.&#13;&#13; Righteous Fury: No longer has a duration or mana cost, remaining until cancelled or death. Also cancelled when a Paladin activates a different talent specialization.&#13; Sacred Shield: When a paladin casts Flash of Light on a target with this buff, they also now place a heal over time effect on the target, healing that target for 100% of the Flash of Light amount over 12 seconds.&#13; Seal of Blood: This ability has been removed.&#13; Seal of the Martyr: This ability has been removed.&#13; Seal of Vengeance and Seal of Corruption: These seals have been redesigned to deal substantially more damage. Now, once a paladin has 5 copies of the debuff from these seals on his or her target, on each swing the paladin will deal 33% weapon damage as Holy, with critical strikes dealing double damage.&#13; Shield of Righteousness: Now deals 100% of shield block value as damage instead of 130%.&#13;&#13; Warhorse: Can now be learned at level 20.&#13; Talents&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Holy&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Beacon of Light: The healing amount on the Beacon of Light target is now based on the total healing done (including over-healing) instead of the effective healing done. Radius increased to 60 yards. Multiple Paladins can now have this active on the same target. Buff indicating a player is within range of the Beacon target is no longer displayed.&#13; Divine Intellect: This talent now gives 2/4/6/8/10% increased intellect instead of 3/6/9/12/15%.&#13;&#13; Illumination: This talent now returns 30% of the mana cost of the spell instead of 60%.&#13; [/list]&#13; Protection&#13; &lt;ul&gt;&#13; Ardent Defender: Redesigned. Currently, any damage taken by the paladin while at 35% health or below is reduced. Instead, any attack that would reduce the paladin to 35% health or below has its damage reduced.

<br />
The Future of Battlegrounds - Q&amp;A<br />
<br />
<br />
[b]Community Team: Joining us today to discuss the future of World of Warcraft Battlegrounds, including the upcoming epic siege-style Battleground, Isle of Conquest, is Lead Content Designer Cory Stockton. First, let’s discuss Battleground participation during the leveling process. <br />
<br />
As it’s something that has been discussed at length for some time now within the community, where are we at with allowing for players to obtain experience through Player vs. Player (PvP) combat and Battlegrounds?<br />
<br />
Cory Stockton: We plan to implement this in patch 3.2.0. We have wanted to allow players to earn experience through Battlegrounds for a long time now and it’s great to be able to finally deliver this feature to players. Experience will be granted based on honor gain from actions, not kills. For example, if you capture a flag in Warsong Hold, you would gain experience, but killing a player would not grant experience.<br />
<br />
If players in the lower level ranges choose to utilize Battlegrounds as a means of leveling their characters, how will the experience gains compare to the Player vs. Environment (PvE) experience?<br />
<br />
Cory Stockton: This is something that we have thought about quite a bit. We want Battleground experience to be rewarding, but we also don’t want it to be the fastest way for players to level up. Based on that, players can expect to earn experience at a rate that is a bit slower than questing at the same level, for the same amount of time.<br />
<br />
Will rewards of some sort for winning a Battleground match be available?<br />
<br />
Cory Stockton: Battleground rewards are high on the list of features that we would like to get in the game. We are not planning to implement this for patch 3.2.0 but we are currently working on it and expect to implement it into a future patch. We are planning to let players roll on mostly greens and the occasional blue item at the end of each Battleground. These items will be highly optimized by class, level, and talent specialization.<br />
<br />
Community Team: Given that gaining experience through PvP game play is a rather substantial addition to the World of Warcraft leveling process, there is bound to be some concern among players that enjoy staying at a particular level to participate only in specific level brackets of the Battlegrounds, otherwise known as &quot;twinking.&quot;<br />
<br />
Do these players still have an avenue to remain at a level of their choosing while still being able to engage in PvP combat?<br />
<br />
Cory Stockton: Yes, players will have access to a new option that will allow them to turn off experience gain in PVP. This option also ensures that you will only be matched against other players that have set the same switch. Players can activate this option by talking to new NPCs, Behsten and Slahtz, near the Battlemasters in Orgrimmar or Stormwind. This new ability will cost 10 gold to turn on or off each time.<br />
<br />
If these players disable the ability to gain experience, will this apply to PvE content as well?<br />
<br />
Cory Stockton: Yes, this option will apply to PvE content as well as PvP.<br />
<br />
Community Team: Shifting gears a bit, let’s talk about the ambitious new Battleground coming in the next major content patch, Isle of Conquest. We understand it is to be a large-scale Battleground allowing for forty players on either side of the siege.<br />
<br />
What player level brackets will have access to this Battleground?<br />
<br />
Cory Stockton: The brackets will be the same as they are for Strand of the Ancients, so a 71-79 bracket and an 80 bracket.<br />
<br />
What is unique about Isle of Conquest when compared to the Battlegrounds currently available?<br />
<br />
Cory Stockton: The Isle of Conquest will offer a number of unique features that players will not find in any other Battleground. Parachute into your enemy’s base and destroy the keep’s walls from the inside using Saronite bombs, drive our newest vehicle, the Glaive Thrower, or hop into the Catapult and launch yourself over the enemy’s wall. Those are just a few examples of the new things you will be able to do in this Battleground.<br />
<br />
What is the story behind the Isle of Conquest; and why are the Alliance and Horde concerned with controlling it?<br />
<br />
Cory Stockton: The Isle of Conquest is located in the Frozen Sea, north of Icecrown. This small island may look insignificant but it is actually loaded with resources and a great spot to launch a full attack on The Lich King and his forces in Icecrown. Both factions have set up a foothold here and now the battle is on to decide who will control the island and make the final push against Arthas and his undead army.<br />
<br />
Community Team: While Alterac Valley is still a relatively popular large-scale Battleground with players, a common critique we hear is that opponents are not incentivized enough to engage each other in order to win the match.<br />
<br />
With that in mind, does the layout of the Isle of Conquest and strategies involved in winning the battle encourage a new level of engaging the enemy head-on?<br />
<br />
Cory Stockton: We have designed the layout of the map based on this kind of input. Players come face to face in a matter of seconds and must fight over the only siege workshop on the map right away. We have also made a big effort to create intelligent choke points on the map that force players to fight for control of the various capture points and objectives.<br />
<br />
Community Team: We would like to take a moment to delve into the various strategic points found on the Isle of Conquest.<br />
<br />
Why do players have an interest in capturing the Oil Derrick or Cobalt Mine?<br />
<br />
Cory Stockton: Not only do these capture points give valuable reinforcements but they also grant honor each tick. Holding both points for the majority of a game will grant a significant increase in overall honor.<br />
<br />
If the Docks are captured, what are the strategic advantages of producing Glaive Throwers and Catapults?<br />
<br />
Cory Stockton: Glaive Throwers are one of the new vehicles we are introducing for the first time in the Isle of Conquest. These are mainly intended to be anti-personnel attack vehicles but they also have an extremely long-range glaive attack. The Catapults are unique in that they allow players to shoot themselves to any destination they see fit. I would recommend shooting yourself over your opponent’s walls and using the Saronite bombs inside!<br />
<br />
What will the Gunship offer the faction that controls the Gunship Hangar?<br />
<br />
Cory Stockton: Gunships are giant flying transports that fly in a path over the enemy keep. The Gunships are outfitted with turrets that players can use to blast the opposing team’s keep walls or players. The gunships also offer parachutes to everyone on board, so you can jump off the side and land inside the opposing team’s keep!<br />
<br />
Community Team: Given that the Siege Workshop is located in the middle of the map directly in between the Alliance and Horde bases, it is bound to be a hotly-contested node.<br />
<br />
What kind of vehicles will this workshop offer the faction that controls it?<br />
<br />
Cory Stockton: Players will be able to obtain both Siege Engines and Demolishers. The Siege Engines available in the Isle of Conquest are upgraded and allow up to three additional passengers. Two of the passengers have access to their own anti-personnel flame throwers while the third gets a gun turret. The Demolishers have three seats in total. Two of the passengers allow players to cast their own spells while the driver gets access to a gun turret.<br />
<br />
What system is being used for capturing these nodes?<br />
<br />
Cory Stockton: Nodes in the Isle of Conquest are captured exactly like the nodes in Arathi Basin.<br />
<br />
Will there be a system in place to ensure that those defending strategic nodes on the map are awarded honor comparable to those on the attack?<br />
<br />
Cory Stockton: This is a common complaint and as such, we have been working on a design to solve the problem! As of patch 3.2.0 any honorable kills that are made within range of a capture point grant 50% increased honor. This change is retroactive to both Arathi Basin and Eye of the Storm.<br />
<br />
How important will producing and operating siege vehicles be to reaching victory?<br />
<br />
Cory Stockton: Siege vehicles will be important since they are your primary means of destroying your opponent’s keep walls and gaining access to the general. However, players can also parachute off of the Gunships generated by capturing the hangar. Once players land inside their enemy’s courtyard, they can use the Saronite Bombs to destroy the walls from the inside. Saronite Bombs will also generate at the Siege Workshop once it is captured.<br />
<br />
Other than the generals that sit in either keep, will there be other NPCs that play strategic roles here?<br />
<br />
Cory Stockton: We do plan to have NPC guards who will run out of the keep to help defend it once a wall has been breached.<br />
<br />
Once the walls of the opposing faction’s keep are breached, how does the invading force ultimately defeat their opponents?<br />
<br />
Cory Stockton: They must enter the keep and kill the opposing faction’s general. Gates block entry into the keep until at least one keep wall has been breached.<br />
<br />
Now that we’ve covered the major points of interest in this new Battleground, will you give a basic rundown of how you expect events to unfold in a match (i.e. where does each faction start, what is the focus of defense, what is the focus of offense, etc.)?<br />
<br />
Cory Stockton: Players start the game inside of their keep’s courtyard. Once the battle begins, players have a choice of going to the Hangar or Docks capture points, or they can opt to head straight for the Siege Workshop in the middle of the map. The main objective is to destroy the opposing team’s keep walls so you can gain access to their general and defeat him. There are a number of ways to go about doing this but they all involve taking a capture point first. Defending your keep is also an important aspect of the game and we have provided no less than 12 gun turrets on each keep to help you out in this department.<br />
<br />
Assuming there will be achievements associated with performing specific tasks on the Isle of Conquest, will there be any change to the “Battlemaster” meta-achievement?<br />
<br />
Cory Stockton: Yes, we have new achievements for the Isle of Conquest but we are not sure what we are going to do with Battlemaster yet. A lot of people already have this achievement so we can’t just go and change it. We will either make a new one specifically including Isle of Conquest, or just not have it be part of a meta-achievement at all.<br />
<br />
Community Team: Just to touch upon one last topic pertaining to World of Warcraft PvP in general, many avid Battleground players would love to see some sort of skill-based ladder system for measuring talent and providing optimal rewards.<br />
<br />
What are our plans for the future of the Battleground system beyond 3.2, and where do you see non-Arena PvP game play fitting in the World of Warcraft, whether it be through the leveling process or at the endgame?<br />
<br />
Cory Stockton: We plan to deliver more Battlegrounds to the players as often as we can. We see Battlegrounds as a very large and important part of the World of Warcraft PvP game and we would like to expand the system as much as we can. I do have a little tidbit that I can share with you guys today, though. We are planning to implement rated Battlegrounds in a future patch. We will be giving more details on this system at BlizzCon.</div></div><hr />

ye i agree. getting t8 thru instances is a bit over-the-top. heroics should drop valor. naxx conquest.</div></div><hr />

Finaly, about time... Verry excited about this!<br />
<br />
<br />
# Pets<br />
* Roar of Sacrifice: Redesigned. This ability can now be used on any friendly target to make that target immune to critical strikes, but the Hunter pet takes 20% of all damage taken by that friendly target. Cooldown increased to 2 minutes.<br />
Not sure yet, if this will keep hunters alive for a little longer, or if the current Roar is better. But the ability to cast on friendly targets is usefull. Still, 2 min CD costs hunters alot, seeing as how they make a favourite target in arenas.<br />
<br />
<br />
# Arenas<br />
* The newest season of Arena gear can only be purchased if you meet the requirements with your 3 or 5 player team rating. Rating requirements from 2 player teams can still be used to purchase the previous season of gear.<br />
Many will not like this, but I do. Some classes have it alot worse than others in 2v2, while 3v3 is more of a balanced bracket. Good way to put more focus on brackets where alot more classes can be &quot;equal&quot;.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chiper</div><div class="date">2009-06-18, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Players who do not wish to gain experience through PvP can visit Behsten in Stormwind or Slahtz in Orgrimmar - both located near the Battlemasters in either city - and turn off all experience accumulation for the cost of 10 gold.<br />
Disabling experience gains will prevent a player from gaining experience through any means available in the game.<br />
<br />
This would have been awesome if it wasn't for:<br />
Players with experience gains turned off who compete in Battlegrounds will face off only against other players with experience gains turned off.<br />
I hope that crosses battle groups, otherwise it's gonna suck.<br />
<br />
There is a now a 20 minute timer on Warsong Gulch. After that time, the team with the most flag captures wins. If this would result in a tie, the team that captured the first flag wins. If neither side has captured a flag, then the game ends in a tie.<br />
THANK YOU! I might actually play this battleground now. The only downside to this is that now all a team has to do is capture one flag and then turtle for 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
Any dungeons that previously dropped Emblems of Heroism or Valor, such as Naxxramas or Heroic Halls of Stone, will now drop Emblems of Conquest instead. Emblems of Conquest can still be converted to Valor or Heroism.<br />
Badge bump! No doubt this will cause much bitching and whining from the naysayers but personally I will be very happy to stop accumulating badges that aren't good for anything but gems and frozen orbs. Also means I'll be able to gear up my alts easier.<br />
<br />
Flying over Dalaran and Wintergrasp is now possible so long as players keep a healthy distance above the ground.<br />
Then I hope they plan to put something in place to kick people off the tops of the buildings in WG... this could really suck.<br />
<br />
Replenishment: This buff now grants 1% of the target's maximum mana over 5 seconds instead of 0.25% per second.So... this is a nerf, huh?<br />
<br />
Invisibility: Can no longer be interrupted by a hostile action or damage done during the 3 second fade time This feels like a nerf to arcane mages... Not much reason to put points into that instant invis now.<br />
<br />
While in Ghost Wolf, snaring effects may not bring the shaman below base normal run speed.I can has for druid travel form? Please?<br />
<br />
The quest log is now double-paned for more easily viewing quest information. It's about time! I might finally abandon Uberquest.<br />
<br />
All the Interface changes are very welcomed, many are things addons have been providing for years.<br />
<br />
All stackable potions now stack to 20. Potion Injectors now increase the amount gained by 25% when used by engineers. Quantity produced by recipes for Runic Healing and Mana Injectors has been increased. My knee jerk reaction was to dislike this, but I think it will be a good change in the long run. More bag space for everyone without hurting engineers. Infact, this is probably a buff to engineering...<br />
<br />
So far I am loving this patch.</div></div><hr />

It says 10% stamina...<br />
doesn't stack with kings, and its castable on other people, so if you want it bring a prot pally... or just get kings and only miss out on the 3% damage reduction<br />

not that big a deal, more for you only have a prot pally and he doesnt want to make the trade off between kings and sanctuary</div></div><hr />

If people are actually missing work, not fucking their wives, etc just to get gear in a video game; they have bigger problems than the changes Blizzard is making. At this point they should try to remember that it's still just a video game.</div></div><hr />

They get a better Will of the Necropolis too, for the same talent points.<br />
<br />
Paladins are the new blood DKs, but they do it better (1 more target on their cleave, don't need to be in blood presence for a 10% healing buff, better mitigation, better AoE threat, non **** 41 talent point, more health).<br />
<br />
And they now get double the block value from items, LOVELY. Because my regular heart strikes already couldn't pierce threw a BV stacking prot pally, let's make the crits be unable to as well.<br />

<br />
No they wont. Just like you, people will whine and bitch and moan and then stfu and keep playing the game. No one has every actually stopped playing because blizzard helped out those less geared then them. <br />
<br />
The same thing happened when 2.4 came out. There was a ton of whining and complaining from the BT/MH raiders about how everybody was getting T5, but none of them stopped playing because of it. They moved into SWP while the rest of the &quot;casuals&quot; were able to get gear that let them move up to content they otherwise wouldn't have seen.<br />
<br />
This is a great way to help gear up guilds like mine who still don't have the critical gear mass to clear Ulduar.<br />
<br />
Just because you are uber doesn't mean everyone else has to be held back. Changes like this open up the game for the rest of the player base and help prevent entropy within guilds.</div></div><hr />

Yes, players will have access to a new option that will allow them to turn off experience gain in PVP. This option also ensures that you will only be matched against other players that have set the same switch... this option will apply to PvE content as well as PvP.WHAAA?<br />

The most mana regain I am getting from illumination. Last raid, for instance, it was 44% of mana regain, so now it's 22% mana regain less. Intellect is our most important stat.

<br />
A nice way to fix some of the balance problems in pvp (maybe the 1st one towards removing arena?!), R.I.P 2vs2. About time. Nice BG changes...<br />
<br />
The new epic gems would boost the heroic dungeons again (so would help alts trying to get rep, gear and/or emblems/achievements)... then... the TBC nightmare is back... doing lower level content to get higher level gear... not again...<br />
<br />
Yes, it was, maybe, worse in TBC where heroics become nothing (making almost impossible to get rep), T5 raids nothing... Karazhan was everything for everyone for the entire TBC lifespan.<br />
<br />
They said they would never make that mistake again... sure, it was totally ok to change emblems between 10/25 versions with the new raid system for 3.2. Totally thumbs up! Classes with their &quot;weird ranged slot&quot; gear could get their librams, idols, etc... without needing to do Naxx/OS/VoA/EoE 25 (to drop it or collect valor) or Ulduar10 (if they couldn't run 25 raids for lack of people/pugs or disconection problems that Blizzard seems to not care to solve). Yes, really good.<br />
<br />
But upgrading heroic/naxx emblems to Ulduar ones? So we'll do get Triumph on 3.3? That really sux.<br />
<br />
We can consider Ulduar not that hard, but heroics/naxx/os/eoe/voa is stupid easier than Ulduar. Not making them a good choice to give better loot. Could even give Conquest in the end of the heroic or from the last boss in Naxx or each wing of naxx, but from everything... not even worth talking about the Triumph emblem from DAILY quests... (does it means that Coliseum will be easy as runing a heroic?)<br />
<br />
Making a mistake once is ok, the same mistake twice is kinda of...<br />

No, im referring to the fact that i was once looking up to the heavy raiding guilds in vanilla times, they were going ahn qiraj and naxx where i couldnt even hope to go that far, they were in a way like the absolute elite in this game, a goal that you can strive to, like hereos. i felt so little and unimportant in comparison^^ sounds funny but throught this patch the elite will completely be removed and noobs as well as raiders will be all alike, there wont be any difference and nothing to look up to... and thats what startles me. they are killing the game</div></div><hr />

No, you don't get a legacy server, BUT you can simply turn off your XP gain when you hit 60 or 70 and raid as and where you wish.<br />

<br />
eye of killrogg/ enslave demon/ hellfire/ curse of weakness/ dark pact/ sence demons/ unending breath/ detect invisibilty/ shadowflame/ soulshards/ broken pets/ bugged pets/ still no escape spell or reliable stun spell or any melee damage immunity and i can go on and on..<br />
<br />
But yeah go ahead. In a few months warlocks will be extinct. <br />
<br />
I am actually contemplating leveling my Warlock starting in 3.2. Not sure if I will really do it or not. Might just get another level so I can have a Felsteed and call it good.<br />
<br />
There is seriously a ton of changes in this patch. Someone put some nails into the nerf bat before taking a few swings at the DK though. Did DK's seriously need that much of a nerf? Is anyone going to remotely consider tanking as a DK anymore? I saw they are making DW a more viable spec, so I might theorycraft that again... <br />
<br />
Rogues and axes... My current question is why? Do Rogues NEED to be able to use every 1h weapon in the game? Will they die without it? Granted, I will probably attempt to bring my Rogue to the weekly Kara run and get the Decap. &gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
I think the bump to Conquest was a slight bit much. Valor would have been acceptable, while normal instance bosses could drop Heroism.<br />
<br />
Paladin changes look good. Gonna miss always having over 75% mana during boss fights... Resto Shaman buff was needed. Actually, Shamans getting buffed class-wide was needed. Glad to see it happened, along with the new Totemus-like addon.<br />
<br />
Anyone else excited to get a Venomhide Ravasaur?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The same thing happened when 2.4 came out. There was a ton of whining and complaining from the BT/MH raiders about how everybody was getting T5, but none of them stopped playing because of it. They moved into SWP while the rest of the &quot;casuals&quot; were able to get gear that let them move up to content they otherwise wouldn't have seen.<br />
<br />
This is a great way to help gear up guilds like mine who still don't have the critical gear mass to clear Ulduar.<br />
<br />
Just because you are uber doesn't mean everyone else has to be held back. Changes like this open up the game for the rest of the player base and help prevent entropy within guilds.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
People actually did. Lost some friends at that time and now in 3.1. The diference is that T5 and T6 raids were still hard (no nerfs and not yet the lol level from wotlk). And people could buy Tier gear or the gear that was meant to complement that tier of raid as it is now.<br />
<br />
They just released some new stuff with the same ilvl but not exactly as good as the gear from that raid tier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Currently, you really don't want to take a fresh 80 into 25 man Ulduar. Granted! However, to really get that person geared up enough to actually help in heroic Ulduar, you really need to run 10 man naxx or 25 man naxx, right? Now, you can just run heroics, in about 2-3 weeks, that new person is ready to jump into Ulduar, or the Colosseum and help out your raid. Excellent! <br />
<br />
The change is there to help new people provide an impact on the new content. Otherwise you have to find a guild that's still doing Naxx when Icecrown is out. Not that likely...<br />
<br />
Does that suck for the people who did the content and go the gear the old way. Of course, but when you lose a few people from your raid group and have to recruit more, and your pool of applicants aren't in blues and heroic gear b/c they can't find groups for Naxx, you'll be happy that they changed this.</div></div><hr />

As was already mentioned here, the emblems changes are two-fold. As Blizzard are apparently can't stop nefing some classes and keep buffing others, people for sure will reroll after this stupid path. I don't expect to see many holy paladins or shamans in raid, for instance. And I am glad I can get some fast t8.5 to my mage to continue raiding as my full t8.5 paladin is converted to piece of shit by blue morons and going to have a rest on my cancelled account with him.</div></div><hr />

*EDIT* rapper: Your current badges stay what they are. Any badges earned from said locations after 3.2 launches will reward you with Conquest.<br />
Speaking of that, really liking the changes to Twinks and BGs. Definitely needed and being able to level by doing BGs is a good plan, since most people hate questing.</div></div><hr />

Actually, they figured out the only way to balance 2v2.<br />
Not care about it at all and dont reward it.<br />
Its easier to balance 3v3 and 5v5 then it is to balance 2v2, and this change will surely help.<br />

Your current emblems will stay the way they are right now, since there will still be gear that can be bought with em.<br />
From patchrelease and so on you will be rewarded EoC, which you can then exchange to EoH/EoV if needed.<br />

All pets now receive 40% of their master's resilience and 100% of their master's spell penetration. In addition, if a player is at their appropriate spell hit chance or hit chance maximum, their pet will be at the maximum for spell hit chance, hit chance, and expertise. If they are below the maximum, their pet will be proportionately below those maximums.This looks like a fix to me.<br />

<br />
Even I, a person who haven't done raids in months, feel really bad about this change. It is just plain stupid and makes NO sense at all, must be fun to all the guys who have done alot of work in raiding Ulduar for T8 and badge items and suddenly those items are available from all piss-easy heroics and naxxramas. WTF was blizzard thinking?<br />
<br />
About the other changes, the BG experience sounds amazing, twinks dont like it of course but leveling an alt is (combined with mount changes) much more fun than before. <br />
<br />
But about the arena thing.. I just hate it, atm only thing I do with my rogue is PvP and I only do 2vs2 because its by far the most enjoyable bracket, more skills and tactics and less crazy burst and overall chaos and zerging :p Now I am FORCED to do 3v3 or 5v5, which I dont like at all. Plain bad change considering most of the players who do arena only have 2v2 team.<br />
<br />
Dalaran and Lordaeron arena changes sound good and the new BG looks fun - I just dislike the vehicles tho and I hope that there are some optional ways of helping your team out if you are not in a vehicle.<br />

They've also still not explained whats happening to the level 60 summonable mount quests.<br />

the badges ones are a bit, iffy. Especially the one about giving an EoT for normal dungeon daily, really harsh on raiders although like much of the other changes, pretty sweet for casual players.<br />
<br />
Glad to see 2on2 now made practically irrelevant, blizzard accept its unbalanced and wont be giving out proper rewards for it.<br />

all in all a pretty good patch, even though as a raider i am slightly frustrated with the badge changes.<br />

As to 2v2 nerf - its really retarded bracket to balance around + it is rather slow copared to 3s/5s. Get 1 more guy to your 2v2 team, and you'll explore by far more enjoyable expirience that one youve seen in 2s.<br />
<br />
<br />
As to pve i just dont like 4 lockouts for 1 instance - rly boring<br />
giving every scrub opportunity to get 2 t8 pieces + some other 226 gear - why? seriously convert valor into conquest is ok, and will actually buff medicore raiders. but why giving it to people who got 80 &quot;today&quot;? At other hand, if they wont move deadly pvp set from badge vendor, that means you can get deadly piece in 2 days, making it around 9-10 days for full set. Not that bad at all.<br />
<br />
And well ty blizz for some nice class balance changes.</div></div><hr />

outrage!<br />
<br />
This ability is slowly using all use. Maybe by the next expansion it will be reduced to 15% and they will wonder why no one thinks the talent is worth it.<br />
God damn... they are going to far in the patch. <br />
Too much change .. I cant take it... <br />

Illumination is as much a signature spell of a paladin as holy light is.<br />
<br />
If they hate the talent so much, instead of nerfing it to hell, they might as well just get rid of it.<br />
And lower the cost of holy light maybe in return.<br />
It will make the game less interesting... but what do they care?<br />

The only way I can see this change being fair for raiders would be that Bosses dropping EoH drop 1 EoC, bosses that drop EoV drop 2 EoV, and then Ulduar Bosses drop 3 EoC and then triple the prices for EoC items, and double EoV items.

I actually quite liked using FoL, HS, HL, and Beacon. My style was more to MT heal but also throw heals on the raid (a lot) when things looked lacking. Basically, I easily get bored of just healing a tank, I liked to heal everyone at once.</div></div><hr />

Because EoC =/= T6?<br />
If following the progression path of TBC EoC is merely T5, with &quot;T6&quot; being either the AC or more likely IC.<br />

Its not like you always have to spam it.<br />
There are other spells to cast and everyone does use them.<br />
<br />
But all this change does is give paladins a lower effective mana pool.<br />
It just seems unnecesary.<br />
It seems no way of making holy light a less used spell in situations where it needs to be used alot. You just have to be more careful with it, because you'll go oom. Which in many cases a paladin now will. Because the paladin is now getting significantly less mana back. <br />
<br />
Though i suppose they want us to use a hell of alot of mp5 gear now. <br />
<br />
I just find it unbelievable considering the uproar when they changed it from 100% to 60%, it was like they couldn't have done anything worse... but now they have.</div></div><hr />

Then I am sure you are aware of the amount of overhealing that a Pally has?

Agreed. A thousand times. More casuals that aren't retarded will agree this is a horrible change than those that like it.<br />

<br />
<br />
Because there was no point in casting anything else.<br />
<br />
This is from my post on maintankadin:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Assuming Glyphed SoW and Libram of Renewal (which are pretty staple and work on Vezax as far as I know), my build [51/20/0] and 4300 base mana for paladins:<br />
Spell - Base Cost - Reduced Cost - Heal per Mana at non-crit<br />
HL - 1247 - 1072 - 14.9<br />
FoL - 301 - 286 - 16.4<br />
HS - 774 - 736 - 10<br />
<br />
It looks like in that case, for me, HS is much more efficient than FoL. I can only cast it every 5 seconds glyphed, mind you.<br />
<br />
Let's assume a perfect storm though:<br />
Divine Favor + Holy Shock = 11k crit.<br />
<br />
That gives me a instant Flash of Light. Let's assume that crits - 7k crit. So I've now healed the tank for 18k at a cost of 1200 mana ( HS + DF _ FoL). That took 2 seconds due to the GCD (I'll have to look and make sure that the insta-FoL is subject to GCD.) I get a free shitty HoT from this as well.<br />
<br />
Mean while my non-crit Holy Light cost me 1072 mana and healer for 2k less. If it crits (using the same assumptions as the FoL above), I just healed for 24k for 1072 mana.<br />
<br />
Seems to me that HL *IS* more efficient even on Vezax. Mind you much of that will probably be overheal at that point.<br />
<br />
<br />
For me, it's cheaper on the mana to cast HL. With all the haste I have and the various procs/raid buffs, my HL is only a .3 seconds slower than FoL.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Casuals are going to be pissing their pants in excitement over it. Now they get to look like those people who spend all day, every day for weeks at a time gearing up and running raids with little effort. But they won't have much beyond the appearance because they won't be able to actually do the raids as well or get the achievements, or the prestige of actually completing some of the truly tougher aspects of the game. But image is everything in this game to some people, casual and hardcore alike.<br />
<br />
Me, I love and hate some of these changes. I'm glad twinks are gone from regular BG's, agree the thing with badges is over the top but none of this is set in stone yet and I think overall the patch is a good thing. It does need the ends tucked in though. Too casual and it does lose some if it's significance and even the true casuals are going to drift away (those being far less than the number hardcore players exaggerate beyond belief). Not casual enough and you lose too many players who can't be bothered to grind day in and out and get stuck with that minority of hardcore players in heaven, until Blizzard shuts the servers down and goes off to play Star Craft II.</div></div><hr />

Always so lovely to see people reaction. I won't even bother trying to define it , it would be a waste of time.<br />
<br />
Another Patch notes arrived , people only bother to read their specific class changes and directly rush clicking the reply buttons to whine.<br />
<br />
After all it's only the 18 th MAJOR patch since Wow Exist. I mean , Never oh never Patch have been subject to changes ... Not even taking in consideration this one is not on the PTR yet.<br />
<br />
To conclude this I'll remind all the heavy whiner around here swearing on blizzard that they DO NOT read those forums , and even if they do they certainly don't read your post.<br />

None taken. I personally love the changes. I fully expect Bacon to have an LoS component added or it's just too OP for PvP. Frankly spamming HL was boring. With bloodlust I was at .8 second cast time. I actually had to wait for the GCD. I stopped caring about healing meters a long time ago. I accepted that overhealing was the way of the beast. Holy light had the MOST bonuses tacked on to it. Splash healing helped keep melee topped off. Bacon allows me to not worry about healing myself if it's that kind of fight via HL.</div></div><hr />

Do you know how long it took me to get my first piece of 8.5!!?!?!?!?!!!!11one&quot;<br />

And, um, that's just what I can be bothered copying from the first 5 pages or so of people claiming they had to work hard/sacrifice/wait ages to get their Tier gear. I'm not even going to comment about the mental state of someone who apparently failed to pleasure his wife in order to focus on getting his Tier gear (the mind boggles), I was just pointing out how interesting it is that apparently Ulduar and the accumulation of Tier Gear is hard work now...</div></div><hr />

Exactly, like the guy said earlier... everyone is pissed off because the game is easy and now that people are getting free Uld 25 loot they are pissed off because of all their &quot;hard work&quot;.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aoyi</div><div class="date">2009-06-18, 09:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a raid leader, I do see some positives with the emblem change. Yes, people can now get conquest badges easier. No, they are not handing out top tier gear. Ulduar gear is excellent now. When 3.2 comes out, it will be one content tier behind. 3.2 is not Tier 9. It's more like ZA. Now why I see this as a good thing. <br />
<br />
As someone who organizes 25 man raids for my guild weekly, there is always the problem of people taking a break from raiding, or coming back after a break and being far behind the gear requirements for where the guild is now progression wise. For that matter, most of us have level 80 alts or dual specs to gear as well. At the moment, my guild is gearing three ranged dps to help them catch up to our level of content (Ulduar 25) and to have them available on the roster. Right now, that means gear runs of Naxx until they have sufficient levels to be viable in Ulduar. Once 3.2 hits, it'll be several more steps required to get them caught up just to have those backups be viable. These were good raiders in BC and just need the gear to jump back in where we need them. <br />
<br />
Additionally, in BC, Blizzard released the Sunwell quality badge gear. This gear was purchasable with the very same badges you started farming as soon as you started farming heroics. Think about how quickly everyone was able to grab that gear as soon as it was released. Now, they're switching all lower tier content to conquest badges once 3.2 hits. This means the only people who can horde those badges now are people already running conquest content. They aren't turning your badges of heroism or valor into conquest. They are simply increasing the way they can be obtained from that point forward. I'm a hybrid. You can bet I'll be taking advantage of some of that badge gear for my offspec. I also have alts which will be taking advantage of it to for when I just may want to swap my melee dps main out for my ranged dps alt on certain raid encounters. Try to think of how these changes can be a good thing for us instead of focusing on the &quot;bad players are getting my gear&quot; comments. Yes poor raiders can get some good gear, but their poor performance will prevent them from getting into most raids (or at least ensure they never get invited back).</div></div><hr />

F-it, it'll be weeks before we see another line or two of changes added in that are extremely minimal changes that mean next to nothing just like nearly every other patch, onto stuff that concerns my alts:<br />
<br />
PvP changes, interesting, interesting indeed.<br />
<br />
Badge change = Win. Able to gear up alt's easier without having to spend 5 hours trying to fill a PuG for Naxx25, or scrambling the guild and guild member's friends to try and put together a Naxx25 run. Releasing these badges isn't a horrible thing, why does it matter if someone &quot;looks&quot; the same as a &quot;hardcore&quot; raider. This is WotLK, 75% of the gear all looks the same anyway. Giving someone the chance to get better gear isn't going to automagically make them an awesome player that can steal your raid position. However, if they are a &quot;casual&quot; player that just couldn't be bothered spending the excess time getting into PuG raids to try and catch up gear-wise, but are skilled, they will now have a much better chance of getting into a guild and actually helping out instead of leeching for a month while they gear up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We all know that Wotlk is aimed more for casuals than before wow was. Every game in present is more casual aimed. Do you think Blizz is interested of 1/4 hardcores or 3/4 casuals? Money! Even that casuals done whole &quot;casual content&quot; and they are getting bored. Blizz wants to keep em in game thats why they trasnefered 3 emblems in 1. And by the way to all tbc players - what about Badge Of Justice? It was only ONE type of emblem and when sunwell released the items were very very good and every casual could get it. Anyway ive read before uldaur when u flame &quot;omg new emblems, flame blizz!!!&quot; Now it will be that what u wanted before and still not good? <br />
<br />
Anyway as some1 said here, even if that noob casual get 2x t8,5 still he will be crap... but if casual pro get it, its gonna improve his gear (because he cant raid coz of job, school whatever), after that patch t8,5 will be crap as now t7,5</div></div><hr />

Yes, people can now get conquest badges easier. No, they are not handing out top tier gear. Ulduar gear is excellent now. When 3.2 comes out, it will be one content tier behind. 3.2 is not Tier 9. It's more like ZA. Now why I see this as a good thing. <br />
<br />
Thank you for a very well worded and thought-out post, this is exactly my position on this matter. <br />
<br />
My guild has 10-15 core raid members who are well geared and always show up for raids. We then have another 20-30 of mixed attendance who are also good players but just don't have good enough gear that we can clear Ulduar. These aren't casuals, they're just people who have lives and can't come to every raid. This badge bump will give them enough upgrades that we can fill in the holes in our dps and healing ability and actually be able to clear Ulduar.</div></div><hr />

WHAT THE FUCK BLIZZARD<br />
we work our asses off in ulduar25 to get the same things you can get with 5 man emblems&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Well as sad as it may seem to some people there are retards in the higher guilds too.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously, you can get 30ish emblems if you run all heroics in one day. So you can get t8.5 head and chest in just 4 days.<br />
Do you know how long it took me to get my first piece of 8.5!!?!?!?!?!!!!11one&quot;<br />
<br />
Time =/= effort.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;This is 2.4 again. It's a outrage, and a spit on anyone who is raiding Ulduar atm. &quot;<br />
<br />
Well it is, you'll get better gear from 5mans than from entry raids and you'll do the entry raids just to get emblems for better gear than that in the entry raid. it's screwing the system all over.<br />
And for the part on pissing on Ulduar raiders well you'd be pissed to if the janitor who does nothing all day except sitting somewhere private fingering his ass gets paid the same amount as you.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;THANKS BLIZZARD FOR LETTING SHITTIES GET THEIR 2pc TIER 8 AFTER RUNNING A FEW DAYS OF HEROICS. WHEN OTHER GUILDS ARE STAYING UP, MISSING WORK, NOT FUCKING THEIR WIVES SO THEY CAN GET THEIR TIER 8.5. FUCK YOU BLIZZARD. Seriously if you dont change this your going to LOSE ALOT OF FUCKING BUSINESS.&quot;<br />

Actually, that defines them as casuals - believe it or not. What seems to be going on a lot is people mixing up casual and bad (I would guess that most of those people are under 16 and have no jobs / lives), but casual =/= bad and I fully agree with you - my guild is in a similar situation.</div></div><hr />

I fully expect Bacon to have an LoS component added or it's just too OP for PvP. Frankly spamming HL was boring. With bloodlust I was at .8 second cast time. I actually had to wait for the GCD. I stopped caring about healing meters a long time ago. I accepted that overhealing was the way of the beast. Holy light had the MOST bonuses tacked on to it. Splash healing helped keep melee topped off. Bacon allows me to not worry about healing myself if it's that kind of fight via HL.<br />
<br />
Why people think that &quot;spaming holy light being bored&quot; and &quot;have mana pool big enough to heal your best in hard mode&quot; is the same? I mean, what is your hardest encounter healed for you to make comments like this? <br />
<br />
First, good holy paladin, even in the mode when MT is BoLed and there's a chance to drop raid heal here and there, would never do it on the target which is above 50% of life - there are priests, druids and shamans to heal raid in non-critical situation. I will drop raid heal only if I am pretty sure it will be 100% eaten. So, the change in BoL isn't changing much for me. All my overheals, when they happened, are on the tank.<br />
On the other hand, Illumination is our single most effective way to restore mana - more than 40% is restored by it. Intellect is our most valuable stat. Now we need what? 20% mana restore decrease (I want to see how they are going to compensate it with freaking mp5) and about -60 intellect. For what? For an ability to BoL tank even when you select the wrong target for your raid-heal? Or for 6000 over 12 sec HoT from Flash on the target with sacred shield? Which is MT, anyway. 6000 over 12 sec is a huge buff on MT healing &lt;/end of sarcasm&gt;<br />
Second, good paladin healing actively, helping with raid healing and applaying all of his arsenal *is* going OOM on hard more even now. People, who are writing different kind of bullshit here about how happy they are they will not have 100% mana end of fight are either lazy ones in good guilds or haven't healed past Ulduar easy mode.</div></div><hr />

BoL from overhealing + FoL puts HoT on the target under sacred shield COMES<br />
30% illumination, 5% intellect GO<br />
They could make it glyphable. Let people choose. Then see how many of serious guild paladin healers would select first over the second. And how many of them would be better healers after that. <br />
If this experiment will show benefits of the first over the second - fine. But if not - don't call NERF or your EXPIREMENTS a class IMPROVEMENT. You are not improving holy, you making it WAY WORSE.</div></div><hr />

Maybe some ppl should have listened few months back when me and few others were pointing out that only healers needed in WOLTK are priests and druids...

If you've done Naxx25 pug'ed a lot, you can get conquest in Uld10 by doing some of the Hard modes. Or, go faceroll through Uld25. <br />
<br />
At the rate you collect them, chances are you will luck into getting one of the tier pieces that you can purchase. Once you don't need to purchase them......... there is nothing else to spend your badges on except pvp gear, and orbs. Or converting them to lower badges to buy Heirloom items if you don't already own every one of them.<br />
<br />
putting conquest everywhere is awesome.<br />
<br />
complaining that it takes away any &quot;worth&quot; they have is lame... they have no worth currently since there are only one, or two items purchasable (per class type) by Conquest badges that are not available anywhere else in the game. They aren't that special or cool. At least they don't take bag space anymore, otherwise they'd be destroyed nightly.</div></div><hr />

wait ......shit!<br />
<br />
hmm ok i can handle a bit of a nerf, most people who dont play priest have no idea the skill cap it takes to be good anyways......SHIT NO MORE 2's? well we were mostly OP in 3's and 5's anyways!<br />
<br />
so then holy raiding gets buffed.....wait....shit! its not a buff but just a tease of a buff!<br />
<br />
so pretty much that sums my concerns for priests, considering i have played this class alone my whole WoW experience and never QQ'd about balance.<br />
<br />
the game itself is going down a long and hard road that will piss alot of players off and please TOO many others(casuals/newbs). this trend is continuos throughout warcrafts history and to be fair they have accomadated to game to all the whiney QQ'y newbs who said this isnt balanced and that is balanced. HONESTLY<br />
<br />
i /quit wow after this patch cuz chances are by the time i get to the end of this dam game blizzard is gonna leave us high and dry anyways a similar taste in our mouths. blizzard doesnt care about &quot;pro&quot; and &quot;balance&quot; when will everyone realize that instead of making the &quot;pro's&quot; happy they just literally just trying to make money!

At what point did &quot;casual&quot; go from meaning &quot;only plays a couple hours a week&quot; to &quot;doesn't show up at every raid&quot;? Casual gamers are people who sit in front of a console in the livingroom for a couple hours. Casual gamers login, run a heroic and log out. Casual gamers don't regularly commit hours of their day to a scheduled online event.<br />
<br />
There's a big difference between 2-3 hours a week and 5-8 hours a day. If a person can make it to even two raids a week while also taking time to farm supplies and do dailies, then they aren't a casual gamer.<br />
<br />
People need to stop misusing this term. This isn't a pass/fail course, there are many degrees of commitment between casual and hardcore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly. Look at this:<br />
These changes should lead to healing as Holy being more dynamic – you are going to be targeting a lot more group members than just the tank, while still providing massive healing on the tank. However, you won’t be able to just constantly spam your biggest heals, at least not on the more challenging encounters. There is an opportunity here for skilled players to really do some outstanding healing as paladins, but it’s going to take a little more effort. This is something a lot of players have been asking for so we hope that it delivers without completely changing what some paladins enjoy about their healing style.<br />
Apparently, the person who post it has a very little understanding of what does &quot;skilled players&quot; are and what kind of problems do they have. As it was already mentioned in many places including the original thread from which this is posted, skilled players have enough skill to figure out whom to heal from raid, so they actually got helaing and tank will be healed by BoL as it is now. The problem skilled healers have is that in the hard-mode encounters they can get OOM. And now they are going to make this problem bigger even. <br />
In 25-man the result will be *just opposite*. When I am not sure I will have enough mana to heal MT for the whole fight, I wouldn't spend it on raid and on keeping BoL up - there are enough healers at 25-man to heal raid . In 10-man hard mode holy paladins will not be taken, as there is no such thing as MT healing in hardmode 10-man - even now we are dropping our Holy Lights here and there and getting to 0 in the end with Lay on Hands and shield/HoSacrifiese, BoP all used - but after this &quot;improvements&quot; we won't have mana for this....</div></div><hr />

And plz blizzard, if U nerf cleeve, RPM will be even more OP and right now it is to good in 3v3. Palas and DK's got long losting nerf and thats good. Now nerf druids a little bit and keep arena gear avaible in 2v2 and it will be fine.<br />
<br />
<br />
To bad for you that Blizz nerf mostly the wrong spec of druids, feral ones.<br />
<br />
I haven't raided even once, but should not be better if Blizzard would allow to trade badges/emblems the other way around?<br />
<br />
I mean, like: <br />
<br />
&quot;2 Emblems of Heroism = 1 Emblem of Triumph&quot;<br />
<br />
On the other hand that really is not important, ....<br />
