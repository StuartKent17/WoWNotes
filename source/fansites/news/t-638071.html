Tonight, we saw the first preview of the stats of a Tier 8 set on the PTRs, for the moment they're only T7.25 sets with an higher ilvl (and armor).<br />
<br />

<br />
I guess it's a good time to post the final preview of the Tier 8 models, there are actually plenty of changes since the last time I posted screenshots of tier 8. The biggest change is probably that all the &quot;old&quot; tier 8 sets have been upgraded with high-resolution textures. Here are the changes for each class since the last time I posted these sets:<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight - Higher resolution textures.<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid - All races added, robe version of the set added.<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter - Higher resolution textures.<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage - Higher resolution textures, and finally decided that the pants version of the set might be the final version for players. As of today there isn't any texture for Tier 8 Mage robe in the game files.<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin - All races added, robe version of the set added.<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest - Higher resolution textures.<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue - Higher resolution textures. There are still a few bugs with this set and the green recolor isn't available on male characters, undead females are also unavailable. <br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman - All races added, robe version of the set added.<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock - Higher resolution textures.<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior - All races added.<br />
<br />
There is also a very high definition screenshot available for each set.<br />

That's a joke, isn't it ?<br />
<br />
My guess is that the image with the pants is to show what the pants look like. I'm sure the chest armor is a robe that would cover that view up... hence the two different images.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing it's the same for paladins as well.<br />
<br />
As far as the different colors, it would be sweet if different specs had different colors for their sets... but I'm pretty sure that's not the case.</div></div><hr />

Here's hoping that Blizz wisened up and Hyrbrid Melee and Tank sets have pants and Healing and Casting sets have skits/kilts/dresses/whatever you want to call them. :D<br />

...On that note, Mages with pants is fail.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Each set comes with 4 color, 2 of them will be used for raid sets and the 2 other probably won't be used at all, they're here just in case the devs need something nice for future items. <br />

Mages with pants ?<br />
That's a joke, isn't it ?<br />
<br />
When I want to do a joke about mages, I just post a screenshot of Recount at the end of the raid. No seriously, all the armor use the same naming pattern, check the screenshot below:<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/march/magetextures.jpg<br />
<br />
RaidMage_G_ is the Tier 8 and RaidMage_F_ is the Tier 6 (Tier 7 being _C_ because it's using the Tier 3 armor sets model), as you can see the Tier 6 textures have an additional texture for the robe, while there isn't anything like this for the Tier 8 set. The robe texture is just not here for the moment, it might be added later but for the moment there isn't any robe for the Tier 8 set of the mage. (I hope it's clear, I didn't sleep much lately)<br />
<br />
You can also notice that the tier 6 sets also had 4 recolors, and you didn't see them in game ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Btw Boub, did you found anything about the Dark-Green Rogue set? I remember Fumi making an preview video of it on warcraftmovies.com :O Liked it so much more then these other 3 colors :-/.<br />
<br />
It's here, check the female recolors. (Or read the text saying that the green recolor isn't available for males yet :p)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If you're a Shaman and you're not wearing a kilt/looking for a decent kilt to wear, you don't just look like an idiot - you are one. Shamans without kilts have no sense of style.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm willing to bet they introduce a fancy new feature that allows you to toggle the robe. Why else would there be so many models?<br />
<br />
<br />
That would be awesome. Honestly I'd love to tank in a kilt/robe - it would hide the fact that the non-set tanking boots will probably fit the Warrior set rather than the Paladin or Death Knight set. 3 seperate looks for tanking boots would be a welcome addition too - or just adding boots to the sets as a 6th item.</div></div><hr />

It takes some finagling to make it work with PTR data, but it's possible. There are other tools and methods, but that's the most straightforward.</div></div><hr />

Blizz has already stated the PVP/Arena gear will not look the same as the PVE Tier gear. Most likely one set is for 8.5, another for 8 and the other two will be unused or used later.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I like the kilt style for Pallies. Here's to hoping we'll see the top white/brown/gold for 8.5 and the red/black/brown for 8. The bottom two are just plain ugly. I'm still iffy on the helm, but this is looking like my second favorite set....tops is tier 2 of course.</div></div><hr />

Three quick points to ponder on this issue:<br />
<br />
Four color sets are seen, and we know that 10 man and 25 man will have different recolors, so thats two sets of colors taken care of (I wonder if anything will be added to the 25 man sets like they did for Naxx 25 sets)<br />
<br />
Also remember that some NPS will most likley be wearing the gear, and this could be where some of the other recolors come from.<br />
<br />
As much as I would like to say that BGs and PVP will get the same modles as PvE, I am reminded of the legendary Blizzard post about dragon nipples :P. They have stated before that the new seasons will have their own gear, gear that has a 'gladiator' feel to it (which in my mind would mean simple models). Also, should they place these models into PVP they would need to have 5 recolors, 2 for PvE, and 3 for PvP (Savage, Hatefull, Deadly [assuming that they keep this three tier system]).<br />
<br />
Thats all, just my ideas though. If I can find those Blizzard posts I will link them.</div></div><hr />

Finally Someone gets it right<br />
<br />
2 colors for 10 man and 25 man......<br />
2 other colors are for N P C's......... They will not wear the same color gear as your class <br />
THey also do 4 colors to see how the public likes each one and bases the choice of 10 man color and 25 man color, why didnt people pay attention to the armor posts when teir concepts came out<br />
there is nothing good about who you are or what you do by guessing about that shit<br />
IT WONT BE PVP GEAR... they will never make that mistake again, because they dont want people to use pvp gear in raids so why have the gear look the same like you actually did something and played the game instead of pvp'd......</div></div><hr />

Now assuming that the T8 (assuming it is tier 8... no source has proven this yet &gt;.&gt; just everbody thinks it is) has only one model (not like in t7)... 2 colors will be used... one for heroic, and one for normal mode...<br />

The pants (on humans/dwarfs) look like something I´d wear on sunday when I know I won´t leave the house and will spend the whole day in the sofa.<br />

So give Paladins kilt and give mages pants and everyone´s happy (except gnomes perhaps) :D<br />

The rogue T8 helm model is extremely ugly to me. Like &quot;using dead human skin to match a leather helmet&quot;?!<br />
It might be looks cool to someone,but very unacceptable in this case. peopel can not choose whether or not to show other's helm , right?<br />
I really wish they could change it before release. I can not just explaining to others this is just a leather helm.<br />
It looks too much like a murdered dead body. Just too much ,guys.<br />

I do not like pally T2, so to the robe verison T8. Too much spellcaster sense. Pally T2 is a failure to intruduce spell damage to pal class. which misguide and fooled the whole class for 4 years. its a nightmare, i do not wanna recall how they mess up T2 original design with pure caster status then mixed with str. all i can say is total crappy.<br />

pally need more ironman style not some backline Paris' chicken dancer . =D</div></div><hr />

I gotta say I was pretty pumped to see this new gear, as everyone was. But I am sorry to say I am incredibly dissapointed in the mages gear, they don't even look like mages in that gear, more like a rogue if you ask me or a ninja. I'm sure this is falling on deaf ear, but I had to let my dissapointment be known. <br />

The priest and druid gear is pretty damn sick thou. <br />

<br />
What are you talking about? T2 was by far and away the best looking Tier gear for Paladins. It did nothing to mess up the design or 'misduide and fooled the whole class for 4 years'. You'd be hard-pressed to find many that didn't like the style. You're actually the first person I've ever heard that didn't like it.<br />
<br />
The stats on T2 were exactly the same as on T1, just better. They didn't pull Str and Spi off Paladin Tier gear until T3. That's just how it was back then. It was a different WoW when MC/BWL were the best.</div></div><hr />

There are four colours because it's shit-easy to do colour replacements on textures and they probably produce a lot more than two colours during finalizing the set look. When you've done that you may as well shove the extra ones into the game code just in case you want to use them later for clothing NPCs or for re-use in other dungeons (a practice Wrath seems to indicate a departure from).<br />

From memory tier 7 previewed with at least 4 colours as well.</div></div><hr />

I'm playing a Druid since the Classic Beta now and according to your logic Rogues won't need a nice T-Set design either cause they are stealthed all the time anyway and Shadowpriests neither cause they are transparent.<br />
What else have we got ? Oh Gnomes they're so small you don't see any Set on them anyway... (k that was a bit farfetched but your post was quite stupid too. ;D)<br />
<br />
Btw: I think most the T8 Designs kind of suck a**. A little more effort would have been nice. Rogues look like they're staring at the ceiling all the time::) and they all seem to lack color. It certainly fits the Winter Theme of WotLK, but I would like more contrast to the depressing scenery of Northrend. More Howling Fjord than Icecrown ;)</div></div><hr />

Ah, I now see that the badge is dangling, but look in the pictures - on the draenei female the hood is bugged, it goes down through her chest, sits a lot lower than any of the other models and pokes out the bottom, leading to the model being all clipped. Blizzplzfix.</div></div><hr />

You are exactly right. City of Heroes has a great character optimization system. It's been four years now and Blizz didn't even &quot;copy&quot; the Guild Wars system of free chosing of colors on your Items. There are a lot of different dyes in the game already. You should just be able to buy some of them and adjust your gear via some sort of ingame Paintshop like window. That would be great. It would also add some sort of individualism to the game and the different players. I mean, every f***ing end game character looks the same. Blizzard is probably concerned about idiots running around in a pink T7 / T8 Warrior Set, but if they want to, why not ?<br />
Guilds might also be able to use a coloring system to have their Guild stick out of the mass by laying down a certain color scheme for their members, so that everyone in a guild sort of looks alike (Guild Tabards, sadly, have been rendered useless since you have to wear a specific faction's tabard in order to get reputation in dungeons) or they could use extreme coloring (like neon) to have certain important people stick out of the mass during a raid... :)</div></div><hr />

The armour isn't customizable, and Blizzard have said this many times, because the resource footprint for WoW would increase beyond what the developers want it at. If you want things like customizable armour then you will have to play a game which isn't specifically designed to be playable on 7+ year old computers.</div></div><hr />

imagine crowd in ah let's say 30 players, you need to get all gear info plus colour info for each piece of gear maybe even for each 'fragment' of every piece of gear from 30 players<br />
<br />
issue 2 is pressure on your machine which will need to generate textures instead of get ready ones, that means bb old pc and i think quite few players would be upset about that.</div></div><hr />

I'm just glad after four years that blizz has some truly new designs in mind and different ideas for the different classes. All of the gear's be so much the same for all this time. As for the gear &quot;looking heavier&quot; i think it's great. It adds an element of intimidation for onlookers who will be able to see the acomplishment of the person who's attained the gear. I think it's a great what they've done. <br />
It's also all magical gear and look where all of it comes from! lol Of course it looks heavier that past sets -it kinna matches the ulduar scene.<br />
I just love that it all is so different. The helms, too. Even if a bit odd some of them, I would show mine off for this set. They're all so kewl!<br />
<br />
As for the comment on there being Mp5 gear and wtf you want old stats? Well I haevn't been on PTR, but my guess is content is going to be different in ulduar... suprise! I feel there've been more changes to class talents and such in the last year than ever before so not only are we getting more class changes, but we're getting content and changes in demands on each toon for that new content.. which means.. ta da! they probably .. amazingly! specced the gear just how it will need to be specced and you'll need that Mp5 or whatever new stats they add over your stats that you used to have to stack lots of for Naxxx and such. ;P</div></div><hr />

Make it simply 2 color tones for 10man and 2 for 25man we choose... all it costs them is to add a color to the names.<br />
It's a shame that they don't do that because the green tone for shamans looks awesome! but im sure it wont be used... :-\<br />
<br />
<br />
Most likely it is. 4 sets, 2 for 10 and 2 for 25. And the breakdown will be according to spec. Thats the way they have done it in the past. And the way they are doing it currently. Look at the tier 7 sets between 10 and 25. Or even the subtle differences between the dropped stuff in the zone. Poeple are putting too much concentration on there being 4 colors, when there is obviously 4 combinations.</div></div><hr />

well if you count each died gear as an enchant on the item, and the rest are simply colors, load texture picture black instead of red, the textures are already on the computer through patches.<br />
<br />
this data is NOTHING for today's technology, you proly used more bandwidth loading the forums page.</div></div><hr />

Actually it creates more of a problem than you think. Think of it this way, everytime you draw a new color for a single person. It creates a new bandwith channel for that server. While that doesnt sound like much you need to think of it in broad compairson. 100k people all with 9-10 pieces of loot that are visably seen at any given time. Now dye them all different collors. Thats 900k banwith channels for data actively ontop of the millions of colors provided to draw the world. The world is expensive. Recycling color combinations cuts the bandwith cycles needed for each server. This lowers the number of blades needed to run a single server and its instances. Which lowers blizzards electric and employee maintence payroll, keeping the cost down. It's not that they are lazy, or that they can't do it. It's just not feasable. <br />
<br />
This is the reason why vanguard, conan, and several other of the high drawn and consumer end juice eating systems needed to run them. It's an economic decision that blizzard has taken into great consideration. One, I am thankful for. However, it would be just as easy on them to add a dying solution like everquest implimented. As it removes the server side bandwith as it's run client side. As it doesn't draw to the server, it just draws via your video card. But it does raise the lower spec bar up quite a bit. And blizzard prides themselves on having even the lowest of specs possible for play.</div></div><hr />

Aren't they supposed to be able to keep up with their pets? Not run in front of them and try to gauge something with their ineffective horns? And really? A gas mask? Have you ever tried running with plate mail on? I have. It doesn't work. You can go for about 20-30 seconds before your legs buckle from the stress. And why exactly do we need plate armor when we're standing at range for our attacks? The hunter tier 8 armor makes no sense, whatsoever. I really like the warlock set... It reminds me of Zul'Aman, when, along with badge gear, hunters had gear that looked like hunter gear, made from fur, wood, leather, and mail. I miss those days....</div></div><hr />

Except Ret/Prot never ever get matching boots. The only matching plate is always holy gear. Therefore it makes more sense to give prot/ret the kilts just to cover up the boots. I know some of you menfolk think it's not &quot;MANNLY!&quot; but get over it.</div></div><hr />
