Yeah, that's the only reason why I dislike her. &quot;lol im a girl gamer, im such a nerd&quot; <br />
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) <br />
And the whole feminist crap she's on about on twitter, and I disliked how she kept whining when she was not let into the Overwatch closed beta while some other streamers were. <br />

I used to watch her a lot on YouTube. I enjoyed her presence. However, ever since her literal tantrum (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIcfAvtoyBs) over the no-blizzcon-announcement back in 2012, I just couldn't stand her anymore. I watch funny or creative adults on YouTube, not children.</div></div><hr />

TBH, I'm fine with the single character focus, it suits me but it's def going to cost them subs, 100%. Amazed they're sticking to it.</div></div><hr />

it would be so easy though - they could use the battle pet models for all the animal forms (little moonkin would be adorable) ... having said that, just give me my damn BELF druid and I will be happy...or at least a new more human or elf -like race that is not ugly on horde side for druid.</div></div><hr />

Makes it a prestige kind of thing for professions!&quot;<br />

Powering up your weapon gives you more attachment to it compared to the bog standard stat stick weapon drops of old. <br />
If Artifacts won't return in the following expansion, I at least hope a new system will be added in its place. Even then, I'd still think it'll be incredibly stupid to replace Ashbringer/Doomhammer/etc with a crappy quest green.</div></div><hr />

Each expansion forces people to a new home city. So they keep separating players as they level because you only see others in chat and not in your city. Cata's only redeeming feature was that capital cities were home as well. Let alone our new &quot;class homes&quot; have all the same issues they claim for guild housing - only worse because you are not necessarily around people you actually play with.</div></div><hr />

Red Shirt Guy was there and he asked a question, it was about the Nagas in Azsuna.<br />
<br />
But, Q&amp;A's is either a hit or miss tbh, I'm hoping for great lore questions, not necessarily questions that would spoil things but rather, intrigue me, get me to hype myself up for potential things to happen. It could also be questions about clarifications thats vague in the game, etc. But questions like the dude was asking about Nomi is just out of the question NOT appropriate in my mind, even if its funny, for those few seconds.</div></div><hr />

He asked if the Nagas had any relationships with the legion and why they were there, and what their goal is. And who they ultimately served, which we really know is Azshara but according to RSG, is never mentioned in the game.</div></div><hr />

This is kind of a hype killer. Like I get they have been there since the beginning but man I hate that my race/faction choice bars me from playing with friends. You can find ways to let players works together yet still keep faction identity. Things like PVP and micro-holidays are a great example of ways you can keep faction rivalry without restricting who people can play with. At the very least if that is their mindset stop having the plot develop in the direction that points up to working together. The thing that sucks is we literally already are doing stuff cross faction, all the time. Only with NPCs instead of players. Class halls make the faction restrictions arbitrary, we are already cooperating with several members of the opposite faction in lore.</div></div><hr />

I think if they allowed us to queue dungeons, Mythic+ and LFR with cross-faction, timers and basically finding people would be much faster (could be totally wrong aswell). It just feels like a quality of life improvement, and should not be related to canon lore at all.</div></div><hr />

Just some of the quick few<br />
<br />
<br />
Cross-faction cooperative questions come up a lot, but they think faction identity is critical to World of Warcraft. They're not happy about two people are barred from playing together by faction, but they feel factions are too critical to bypass<br />
<br />
Factions haven't mattered since vanilla. Legit every single expansion EVERY SINGLE ONE we work together. Enough with this bullshit already just get rid of the faction barrier<br />
<br />
<br />
Mythic raiding not being cross-realm is one of the few remaining bastions of server-specific identity.<br />

If you're going to destroy the idea behind server identity with everything else, arbitrarily keeping one tiny thing is pointless and stupid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But it still bring up the point that it's ok to remove the faction barrier for the sake of queues but not for playing with friends? If anything it's silly because PVP is the one place the faction rivalry should matter most, yet it is the one place that compromises it and lets people play with the other faction, granted it is in a limited capacity.</div></div><hr />

In the Q&amp;A, Ion said that after Legion, players can still get it on your artifact weapon, but not on any weapon. So you have to get it now if you want it on any weapon.<br />
<br />
OT: I agree, the Q&amp;A was quite boring. I was hoping for more lore questions like Jaina Proudmoore, Tess Greymane,etc. Questions like &quot;the sunwell, gnome druids, backpack, khadgar's last/first name, metzen-forge items, etc&quot; were so irrelevant. Majority of Devs' answers were so vague that it felt like the questions weren't even answered.</div></div><hr />

Raiders realm hop every expansion or so to get into mythic guilds anyway. EU, Asia, US, is way more interesting now that we live in 2016. We used to care about other guilds on our server, but really, now it's basically who is on our region. Server population varies greatly from a expansion to an other, my server was High at the beginning of WoD, is now a low, sometime medium right now. No one cares to be the best of an empty server, I would rather be the second in a larger community where you can find more players and have more competition. Anyway, my thoughts.</div></div><hr />

i mean, if i dont buy legion now, and only play on the next expansion, im be able to get the artifacts, and still use their appearance for transmog, but i will not be able to get the custom appearances like the pvp one or the archiev, and so, i will not be able to transmog those custom appearance?</div></div><hr />

Servers are an antiquated concept. Blizzard's new dynamic sharding technology is a much better solution to the network stress problem that servers were originally supposed to address in WoW and earlier MMOs. The only necessary splitting of the player base that remains now is server type (PvE, PvP, RP, RPPvP). &quot;Server-specific identity&quot; is a meaningless quality that should be done away with entirely.</div></div><hr />

What are Cross Realm Zones?(Not to be confused with Looking for Group(Dungeon Finder), Cross Realm Groups(CRG).) This system automatically adds people from all different servers into one zone to make it look like the world is &quot;populated&quot; While this might make the game look &quot;alive&quot; it's an illusion at best since you cannot trade with these players, you cannot invite them into the guild you're in and they are also taking away Herbs / Ores away from your local server/s. I do hope they turn it off once they connect more realm together and be done with this god awful system once and for all.(and so i can resub to the game)<br />
<br />
Cross Realm Grouping: You invite people from other servers to join you on your local server, this can be done via friends list or by the LFG tool.(This i have no issues with)<br />
<br />
As for dungeons you have Looking For Group/Dungeon which is another system that automatically groups up people for non mythic dungeons. For mythic/s you have the LFG (default is &quot;I&quot;) which you create your own group.<br />
<br />
<br />
The issue i have is, CRZ is forced on you if you like it or not. While i did mention a few issues above i have other issues with it, if your on a PvP server CRZ can be a fucking nightmare to do anything on. Yes i know i signed up for PvP server but not when it was like this. You will be doing quests etc and all of a sudden CRZ thinks hey your too much a lone and phases you into a CRZ phase where there is a shit load of the other faction and you die, you cannot fight back you cannot do anything. This is extremely disrupting game play and has never been in WoW. <br />
<br />
There is other examples of mobs phasing in and out, nodes phasing in and out, other players phasing in and out, it's a fucking mess and it doesn't belong in WoW. These devs are morons to think that this system is a good idea and i hope this game burns down to the ground because of their &quot;all ways right&quot; mentality. I've played WoW since near the release of WoW back in 2004/5 and I've never seen a &quot;feature&quot; that has been this disrupting to game play and immersion. In Mop they promised / swore till they where blue in the face that CRZ would not be forced into current content, but Blizzard being the deceptive assholes they are lied YET AGAIN.

Also, he sounded like he was on the sad side of his first experience with significant amounts of alcohol. I also was not a fan of the hostess - her comments over top of the people giving the Q and A was particularly galling. I don't watch her shows on WoWhead for a reason. Why not get Scott Johnson up there, or that guy who was doing the eSports on the Broadcast? Both of them are extensively knowledgeable and would have let the people talk. Also, I don't give a shat what your character name is, your guild, your server, who you want to recruit, or who needs a shut out. <br />

I'm kind of sad that we won't be keeping artifacts. I don't know how it'll make sense, as giving up a blade such as the Ashbringer or Felo'Melorn makes no sense in my mind.<br />
<br />
My personal expectation is that we're gonna have to sacrifice the power in our artifacts to seal Argus away - depriving the LEgion of its most powerful world. Not destroying them; not eliminating the threat, but crippling them (ala the end of Star Trek Voyager).</div></div><hr />

Part of me wants to say that we may somehow imbue ourselves with said power. That is if we are going to keep said artifact abilities. Idk your way fits as well I'm just curious how people would react to losing their shiny new artifact abilities. For some I know it wouldn't matter but for others like fire mages....

She's become an entitled brat. The hissy fit she threw over not getting an Alpha invite for Legion in the very first wave was despicable. She got in the very next day. It was pathetic. And she acts like that any time she doesn't like something. Zero respect for her.</div></div><hr />

I really hope we actually make some kind of progress with the Legion, now it just feels like we aren't (Xavius will just come back? Archimonde etc, guessing KJ too after 7.2)<br />
<br />
Argus is a demon world, so yes, any demon killed there will die permanently.<br />
<br />
I think Xavius is the exception since he was corrupted by N'Zoth to the point where he became more of malevolent force than an actual entity (technically he wasn't killed when Malfurion turned him into a tree, therefore his soul might not have returned to the Twisting Nether, so N'Zoth could have seized it instead). <br />

However... I can't remember if he is still classified as &quot;Demon&quot; in-game, so probably not depending on that.<br />
I think we have seen the last of him, though.</div></div><hr />

Though I read somewhere that Argus is apparently drenched with enough fel magic that any demons that die there, die for good. I really hope we actually make some kind of progress with the Legion, now it just feels like we aren't (Xavius will just come back? Archimonde etc, guessing KJ too after 7.2)<br />

Powering up your weapon gives you more attachment to it compared to the bog standard stat stick weapon drops of old. <br />
If Artifacts won't return in the following expansion, I at least hope a new system will be added in its place. Even then, I'd still think it'll be incredibly stupid to replace Ashbringer/Doomhammer/etc with a crappy quest green.<br />
<br />
<br />
I strongly agree with you, and I can't agree with that: &quot;They'll make Artifacts going away make sense.&quot;<br />
<br />
1, In theory these weapons are the most powerfull, so, why change them? The Artifacts aren't just weapons what you replace and then vendor it...<br />

2, You spend a lot of hours to unlock every trait, to maximize your weapon. And after a year (or two) your whole f*king work is go waste. :/ This is a nonsense in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

Its not going to waste though, because you get to use those traits and that weapon and enjoy the fruits of your hard work for the next 2 years? May as well say getting gear is a waste because at some point you're going to replace it. Artifacts are part of the story of Legion, so they stay in Legion. Then, next expansion, there'll be something new and cool to play with instead of the it having to deal with carrying over baggage from past expansions. If they carry over everything from every expansion the game just ends up a bloated mess again and they spend more time trying to keep legacy systems relevant and less time working on cool new stuff.

I can't imagine any reason why a Paladin should put down the Ashbringer, or a Shaman the Doomhammer. The strongest weapons ever....<br />
<br />
Comparing the Artifacts to the gear from raids isn't a good thing. You have to put much less effort to obtain a gear-piece compared to maximizing your artifact. In a (very) fortunate situation you can get your BiS gear by playing just a few hours. And it's natural that you change it, when the new expansion come. But you can't max out your Artifact as easily as you can obtain gear. <br />
<br />
But okay, a simple iLVL 1500 &quot;Demonbitten Warmace&quot; without any extra funciton probably will be much COOLER than the Doomhammer (what you leveled for months).</div></div><hr />

Remember every legendary from previous expansions? They were the most powerful item in Azeroth at that time. Then we progressed beyond that shit and got new gear. Likewise for the artifacts. Stop acting like this is something new.</div></div><hr />

How many times I heard this, when a woman has a genuine and excited interest in a culture. Someone loves the superficial things in it, not just the deep lore and bis items. Gods save his/her soul! What a poser! How dare someone act like they are terribly enjoying themselves and the culture. She should list the paladins in the lore or tell how did Varian's wife died and what was the &quot;weapon&quot; to prove she is really interested in this? That would make it good, or you would still doubt it? You know, the magic in this &quot;geek&quot; thing is that everyone is interested in a different angle. Gameplay or lore, the world, the community, the rpg part. Different things.<br />
<br />
She is doing more than you ever will in your life. She did successful charities, she talks openly and honestly. She cares about people. She is very much loved in the community. Contributed to it so many times. In many positive ways. Unlike you.<br />
<br />
I know, maybe you never had such passion in your life, so you misinterpret her (and others) reaction. She has a good soul, maybe bubbly and babbling sometimes, but I can connect to her moderation more than to a cold hard &quot;just do this shit&quot; kind of person.</div></div><hr />

The other hand, Guild housing seems like a pretty hype idea. I understand why there is some difficulties with it, but at the same time, it wouldn't be a bad time. People would want to turn them into mini-capital cities, but 9/10 people are in a guild, so their guild house would become their capital city and places like Orgrimmar or Stormwind would become as barren as Silvermoon and the Exodar.</div></div><hr />

Calls people immature then proceeds to insult them in an immature fashion. Logic. But explain to me how us saying that you enforce your opinions upon your family by saying they cannot play games because you dislike them is white knighting?

<br />
Is it possible to miss the point any more. Those who want player/guild housing DON'T want it to be meaningful. If it is meaningful then it becomes almost mandatory. This was one of the many problems with garrisons. Copy housing from FFXIV, something you only do for fun, something that others can easily see your creativity (not each one phased separately), and leave it at that. The instant you add something meaningful to something like this, it becomes a chore and not something you do because you have to, housing should be something you do entirely because you want to.</div></div><hr />

No, you can no longer use the old models for Night elves/blood elves, and all the old animations are gone(which is the dealbreaker for most of the people who prefered the old models). Many of the new models are nice, but several of them also feel unfinished. Could definitely use some more work on animations, textures, and adding small things like new hair styles or hair colors.<br />
<br />
The game could use some more character customization outside of new transmogs. No need for height/weight sliders or complex stuff like that, just more options would be nice. I haven't heard anything about that in a long time, though :s</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;&quot;The raid armor you're getting from the Tomb of Sargeras is very heavily inspired by the Tier 6 sets from Black Temple.&quot;&quot;<br />
- UGH,.. as long as it's not pink again (rogue),....<br />
<br />
The guild housing issue sounded like it was due more to the question of who would make the decisions to affect the guild house etc. I do hope it isn't pink again either lol.</div></div><hr />

Here's the answer you would have gotten: &quot;We want to balance the game to everyone's satisfaction. This sometime takes longer than some people would like this to take and we apologize for that. UPcoming patches will contain measures to fix current balancing issues. &quot;<br />
<br />

So basically if an undead paladin tried to use paladin's anti-undead abilities they would probably just kill themselves aswell.<br />
<br />
Thats how i would explain it. :P <br />
Also if a paladin dies they become holy light, as seen in that ICC quest (they will probably end up fighting in the army of light)... but i havent really heard the same about priests. <br />
Essentially you cant be paladin and undead because you would have to die and be reincarnated to be one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now guess how many people on here would call your question a lame question.<br />
<br />
It's not a lame question -- it's a lame half assed answer that I agree with you that they'd say.<br />
<br />
Truth is: They are complete shit and pants-on-head stupid when it comes to communication intentions of specs / classes.<br />
<br />
Because of their failure -- people are lacking knowledge in areas. This makes defining balance hard when you're not sure what is a baseline knowledge since they refuse to create a baseline.<br />
<br />
To elaborate: Do you use Noxxic or Icy Veins?<br />
<br />
At this point Noxxic is considered, by many, to be very bad but how are you supposed to know that? If you follow a bad guide and feel underpowered -- how are you to know this is &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;.<br />
<br />
Let's make it even more fun: There are actually &quot;wrong&quot; choices for talents. By wrong I mean &quot;under performs in every single possible way.<br />
<br />
So not only are they shit at answering balance questions -- they can't even say &quot;here's the minimal you should be at&quot;.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zequill</div><div class="date">2016-11-07, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To elaborate: Do you use Noxxic or Icy Veins?<br />
¸<br />
<br />
I have just look at my spec. One only tell me to &quot;take those&quot;, the other one is explaining me each talent if they are good or bad. Easy to guess which one I follow.<br />
<br />
The next step would be a talent by talent simulation result but I guess I can do this myself if I need too.<br />
<br />
Also, looking at the talent, you can guess if a talent is either AOE/single target, passive/active, hard to manage/ease your rotation and if you put some taught in your class, you can guess which one worth it or not.<br />
<br />
With that in mind, each talent cannot give the same output. Either all the talent in a row are need to be pretty much the same in those 3 categories (increase your dps by 10% via spell X, increase your dps by 10% via spell Y or increase your dps by 10% via spell Z) or some need to give out more number (passive/easy should give less then active/hard talent).</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are many things in the game that go against the lore to make the gameplay more appealling. So its pointless to bring in facts about the gameplay.<br />
<br />
But one instance doesnt make evil become evil or good become good, catch my point?<br />
<br />
So in general sense there hasnt been much of action from priests against undead... where as the entire purpose of paladins is to fight undeath.<br />
Where was the last time you saw a priest npc in a major situation? like Tirion has been pretty central in many occasions already... ICC, Legion...<br />
I only remember Benedict being revealed as a dreadlord a few expansions ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Comparing the Artifacts to the gear from raids isn't a good thing. You have to put much less effort to obtain a gear-piece compared to maximizing your artifact. In a (very) fortunate situation you can get your BiS gear by playing just a few hours. And it's natural that you change it, when the new expansion come. But you can't max out your Artifact as easily as you can obtain gear. <br />
<br />
But okay, a simple iLVL 1500 &quot;Demonbitten Warmace&quot; without any extra funciton probably will be much COOLER than the Doomhammer (what you leveled for months).<br />
<br />
I can only imagine that the Artefact weapons are needed to contain or destoy the legion and will be locked away or destroyed in the process.</div></div><hr />

Logic. But explain to me how us saying that you enforce your opinions upon your family by saying they cannot play games because you dislike them is white knighting? I don't think you actually know what it is. Also you pretty much told us what it is. &quot;I don't like these specific games so my family can't have an opinion of their own and must share mine by not playing them&quot;.<br />
<br />
Yes i insulted you in a immature fashion to get on your level so you could understand. Since it's pretty obvious that you don't read whole entire posts and just keep repeating your self, so i have to keep things simple.<br />

Again insulting people. So mature. I pretty much echoed what you said which was &quot;I've banned this specific game in my household because I don't like it&quot;. Therefore you do not allow your family to have an opinion of their own and force yours down their throats. If you even have one that is. But calling me a troll really isn't helping you here.

Are you a narcissist? I never called you a white knight, are you doing this for attention? It's pretty obvious that you don't read posts AT ALL which didn't help you either. I did state in a post that my partner agrees with me with my views. I never said i force my opinion down my family's throat. I'm not going to get into this with you anymore since it's obvious that you lack the understanding ( like many here on these forums) and the comprehension of the English language. <br />
<br />
Here I'll explain it so you can understand once and for all, since it's seems it's too hard for you to go back to earlier posts:<br />
<br />
Yes! I've banned Skylanders(this is what i was referring to and WoW due to reasons i stated before) from my household(partner agrees) because Skylanders is a blatant rip off. Now i have no fucking clue how you get that I'm forcing my opinion on my family or do not let them have an opinion of their own. I grew up with a shit load more rules than i have set for my kids, rules and bans the same damn thing. Shit when i was naughty as a child i got banned from things and i do the same with my kids now since it works. Kids need rules etc i really don't want to get into what is it to be a parent etc<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Now i understand why my partner stopped posting on these forums.... People like to twist words to match their own agenda.</div></div><hr />

So again you banned your kids from playing a game you do not like. Sounds like exactly what I described. Unless they did something to warrant that ban you are forcing the opinion that they should not be allowed to play this game because you dislike it due to personal opinions despite whether they might like it or not. Also not that whole &quot;it was just as harsh when I was young line&quot; doesn't work. As you stated you were banned from things as punishment. Unless your children warranted punishment then all you are doing is again saying &quot;don't play this game ever it's banned in this house because of my personal opinion that the game is a ripoff&quot;<br />

<br />
And again with the insults. Why because I basically quoted you and asked you &quot;did your children do something to warrant you from not allowing them to play skylanders?&quot; If not then your personal opinions are the reason they are not allowed to play it nothing more which is what forcing an opinion is. If you are gonna continuously insult me then please by all means end this conversation because all you have done is attempt to evade any time I have quoted you.<br />
<br />
So I will ask you again. Did your children do anything to warrant you not allowing them to play Skylanders? Or are you not letting them because you and your partner personally dislike the game due to personal opinions of said game? Simple question and all it needs is an answer.<br />
<br />
And slightly off topic. I have a kid on the way. If he ends up liking video games that I don't then I won't ban said video games. :)</div></div><hr />

They were aiming for it to be back in Patch 7.1 as well until two weeks ago, though. The problem with the Fishing Tournament is CRZ, so they're looking to make it a region-wide contest instead of based on the server or CRZ. This makes server population matter less.&quot;<br />
<br />
Get rid of CRZ, it's not fucking rocket science that this system has failed on a lot of levels, it's the main reason i quit WoW.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;They don't want to restrict character creation based on factions to fix faction imbalance, but they are going to do a new round of Connected Realms to help with the issue.&quot;<br />
<br />
Good, now maybe we can turn CRZ off and go back to having people you can interact with, instead of using up the space you're in.<br />

Its kinda sad that you ban WoW from your household just because YOU don't like a feature of the game. I'd call that pretty immature in and of itself. I would have to agree with Eleccybubb you come into a thread about WoW, spout your bullshit biased hate, proceed to call anyone who disagrees with you a &quot;white knight / troll&quot;. And CRZ, really? Thats why you &quot;quit&quot; WoW, because of a feature that helps realms feel more populated and to see other players once in a while? Stay classy there Roar-Powah.</div></div><hr />
