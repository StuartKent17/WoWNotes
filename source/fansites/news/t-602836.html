Raids &amp; Dungeons<br />
In 2.3, Badges of Justice drop from Zul'aman and Karazhan bosses (1-2 per bosses). You also get 2 badges from the heroic daily quest. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2518909551&amp;postId=25741587220&amp;sid=1#4))<br />

Alterac Valley changes are being watched very closely on 2.3 PTRs, they will go live, but might be tweaked before. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2512088480&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=1#18))<br />

The Mad Alchemist's Potions &quot;side effect&quot; is actually a random buff from other elixirs. However it won't replace existing elixir buffs if you have one on. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2517896652&amp;pageNo=6&amp;sid=1#114))<br />

Edit: well, all shots a 1-35 now, now I switch to, this is just temporary, it will never last. If it does go live I'll be very disappointed. I could literally just start strafing away from a mob no wingclip or anything and shoot them as soon as I gained the slightest amount of ground, as the 1-35yd range would suggest. Lame.</div></div><hr />

Shots are available as close as 4 yards, cutoff melee range is 5 yards. That means hunters CAN shoot from melee range (the 1-yard overlap) HOWEVER the tooltip is still incorrect as you cannot shoot from 1, 2, or 3 yards. Check out the forum thread if you don't believe me :)<br />
<br />
I did a quick test of the hunter range on the PTR. You CANNOT shoot from melee range, nor can you melee from shot range. Link to the thread is:<br />

<br />
It is possible that Aimed Shot is 1-x yards, I am going to go respec now and try that.<br />
<br />
EDIT: There appears to be an overlap between 4 and 5 yards. Five yards is the current end of melee range, yet shots are usable as close as 4. The tooltip is still inaccurate, however, but it remains to be seen if this 1 yard overlap is intended. Also, I tested Aimed Shot, it is not usable any closer than any other shot ability.</div></div><hr />

From the looks of things, the helm should actually be the Mojo-Mender's Mask, seen here. http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/october/curse_za_4.jpg<br />
<br />
Other than that, spot on. Thank you blizzard for yet again, using the old school Elements set.</div></div><hr />

I for one think Elements/tier0.5 were one of the best/coolest looking shaman sets ever... and i think that elements/ ZAShaman set are no way alike... they may both have things sticking out of its shoulders..but whtever..<br />
<br />
i think the za shaman sets the coolest of them all....if u don't want it, i'd gladly trade for any of the other class ZA Sets...lol =)</div></div><hr />

It's the same cost, Arcane Powder as a requirement just gave more sense than the teleport runes.</div></div><hr />
