<br />
Crestfall<br />
<br />
Crestfall is a new Island Expedition coming in Patch 8.2, with elements of the Warcraft map. <br />
There will be dragon skeletons, gryphon rider hammers, cannon towers, destroyed battleship, and more. <br />
It will tell micro stories, such as &quot;This is where the Humans would have built their barracks&quot;, but now it's a rundown and destroyed castle. <br />
<br />
<br />
Island Expeditions<br />
<br />
A lot of stories were started on islands with one time questgiver quests, such as something going on with the Mantid. Those are setting up stuff. <br />
Some of those threads will get pulled on as we go through the patch process. It'd be interesting to look at those and figure out which of them will take off and where they will go, because a couple of them will go to some pretty interesting places during this expansion. <br />
Maybe in some Normal Island Expeditions, you could have more time to do exploring and less time pressure. The team may experiment with this in Patch 8.2.<br />
<br />
<br />
New NPC AI<br />
<br />
The new brawl in Patch 8.1.5 that puts players up against AI in Arathi Basin will be the first big use of the new AI tech outside of Island Expeditions. This is an opportunity to give the AI meta battleground strategies. Should the AI jump off the cliff and Slow Fall down to the Blacksmith? <br />
They could use the NPC AI to make a new bodyguard buddy, jumping around you, climbing up rocks and looking off into the distance.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story and Nazjatar<br />
<br />
Whenever the team develops the story, they keep in mind the story that is going throughout the entire expansion. One in this expansion is Sylvanas's rise to power, how she is using it, and how people react to it. That's a key to how we get to Nazjatar and what happens there. <br />
You'll start to see links between what people are doing and how it is impacting our story and where we are going really start to come out during the Nazjatar questing. <br />
You will have some impact on your surrounding area in Nazjatar. You'll be meeting a group that is indigenous to Nazjatar and helping them out, which has it's own local impacts. <br />
The effects of what's going on with the greater story may not necessarily take place in Nazjatar, but in other places across the world.<br />
<br />
<br />
Allied Races<br />
<br />
The team loves the Allied Race system and thinks it is a strong system. <br />
The team does plan to add more Allied Races, but nothing to announce right now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Systems<br />
<br />
The team is pulling away from gating content with quests that require you to collect thousands of shards and instead focusing on big story quests that you can complete and feel like you got an awesome story reward for playing through a space. <br />
In addition to that, there are a significant number of people working on sandbox systems and overworld systems, as well as an updated world quest system across the entire zone. <br />
<br />
<br />
Nazjatar and Mechagon Content<br />
<br />
You'll be introduced via big cinematic moments, unlock your hub, meet your new friends, and then you've got the new bodyguard system.<br />
Your bodyguard will be leveled up, gaining additional stories and abilities as you are leveling them up. The new quests will tell you about the new races, giving you drips of story. <br />
You'll have a whole new set of world quests, unlike anything the team has done previously. <br />
There may periodically be public events that pop up, similar to the Legion Assault system. You can join in on the scenario in the world with everyone and finish it. <br />
It should feel like there is stuff happening all over the place. <br />
What were some of the coolest sandbox systems of Timeless Isle? Every once in a while you would see a shrine that you could click on and spawn a mini event. Things that you don't see every day, but will come upon occasionally when playing through a space.<br />
The team wants to double down on the feeling of an exploratory sandbox. You should still see things for the first time, even a couple months into playing. <br />
Mechagon is going in an entirely separate direction in terms of how content is unlocked and what it turns into.<br />
You can gather all sorts of crafting materials across the space, and it has a local crafter with lots of mechanical rewards. If you bring him a battery, spare parts, and some scraps, he can build a spider bot. <br />
It should feel like a breath of fresh air in terms of how content is being delivered and what you are getting over time.<br />
There isn't a dedicated team working on secrets added to the game, they are just passion projects.<br />
<br />
<br />

Kul Tiran and Zandalari Unlock Requirements<br />
I think one of the major worries was if a dungeon/raid would also be part of the requirements.<br />
I’m really glad there not along with having to being exalted with the other factions too just to unlock those two.<br />
We clarified that raiding wasn’t needed and people immediately wanted clarity on what was needed down to specifics. I put this together to help ensure everybody was on the same page and if they aren’t exalted or avoid doing quests, they can hop on those right away.<br />
<br />
Since the zones are separated, will unlocking KT humans also unlock the Zandalari?<br />
If you have unlocked Kul Tiran and you want a Zandalari then you need to do all of the horde requirements on a horde character. The mag’har/dark iron worked this way as well if I’m remembering right.<br />
<br />
Serious question: I have an Alliance toon that has met the requirements for Kul Tirans. If I faction swap to Horde before unlocking Kul Tirans, will I still be able to complete their scenario and unlock them? I do not have another 120 Alliance character.<br />
<br />
While I am not 100% sure on how the achievements themselves work with a faction change - the point that was mentioned above would be the primary issue: you would need a max level Alliance character to do the recruitment questline.

Correction. You are gating the story by weeks for no actual gameplay reason other than to keep that MAU count up. If there was actually a lore reason then fine. And no &quot;oh we must prepare&quot; is not a lore reason.<br />

<br />
Everything seems rather straightforward, no risk taken, a new hub with World Quests, Invasions and Shrines, they don't seem to be willing to take risks anymore after the Azerite/Islands/Warfronts fiasco.<br />
<br />

<br />
And there's the issue. Any criticism to you is &quot;salt&quot;.<br />
<br />
Every time they've said the new WQs would be unique they haven't been. It's usually just either reusing quests from the levelling experience or the usual stuff.<br />
<br />
And removing the whole &quot;collect 1000 nethershards&quot; stuff doesn't mean squat when they are timegating. If you can give me a legitimate reason to timegate when a lot of other games don't/do it by a week at most then I'd love to know. Because this whole &quot;players would just consume content&quot; is a tired old excuse imo among others.<br />
<br />
And the 3rd thing was a suggestion. They should take a look at other games and how their events are done so they can learn how to do things like this. Because the invasions on Argus were just glorified scenarios.</div></div><hr />

There are different ways to formulate criticism. Yours was filled with sarcasm and cynism. Both rub off as salt very very fast in written format.<br />

Can't blame the other guy for calling your first comment salty, because it reads like salt. Even if you want to be critical of things. Wording is key!</div></div><hr />

I'd say my wording is fine but you are entitled to your opinion of course.<br />
<br />
Admittedly it comes from frustration because they repeat the same tired old bogus and nothing changes. There's only so many times you can do this.<br />
<br />
Everytime they say &quot;oh we know we made a mistake&quot; or something along the lines they barely learn from it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally I prefer those sort of grind quests than pure time gating. Sure, in essence it's still timegating (through raid lockouts and stuff), but at least you actually have to do something to proceed and unlock the next part of the quest.<br />
<br />
This timegated &quot;campaign&quot; quests is probably the feature I dislike the most since WoD. It feels incredibly awful, immersion-breaking, anti-climatic and forced, to play about 1h worth of &quot;main quest&quot; content, only to then have to wait another week to have another 1h worth of the continuation, without any good or believable reason.<br />
<br />
I played through all the MoP main quest and even if the grind was a pain at times, it at least was exciting to complete those quests, proceed on the quest and eventually get the legendary cloak as a reward. Ever since WoD started with this weekly &quot;unlocking&quot; of quest parts I stopped completing them. Even though I was actively playing, raiding every week, I felt zero will, motivation or investment in those quests. By time the next part of the quest releases, I don't really remember or care anymore about what I did before on that quest.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's not that I'm agaisnt content being unlocked over time, especially when it makes sense lore-wise. But it needs to be a reasonable amount of content so that it feels that like it's a stream of content, and not tiny drops with the only perceived reason being to artificially extend player subscriptions.</div></div><hr />

It's an iconic Warcraft location which was visible in the handbook which came with Vanilla version of the game. It's of course much older than that, but still.<br />
<br />
When WoW started to have rumours of a &quot;South Seas&quot; expansion I was speculating myself if they'd finally add Crestfall into the game and what it could have. It should be an outdoor max level zone, with various locations like a pirate fortress which could be a dungeon (or even a small raid). Maybe an Alliance town could be there (I think on Vanilla map it had a settlement marked on Crestfall).</div></div><hr />

The focus on world content is something I'm really looking forward to.<br />

It saddens me to learn that there'll be more allied races though. I think we have more than enough. But if we have to have them please don't make them breach faction uniqueness like Void Elves and Nightborne did.</div></div><hr />

I don't see his post as salty at all. I for one agree with him, as many do I am sure of that. First Blizzard has a HUGE reputation of NOT listening to its gamers at all. And doing time gated shit like this just proves that for sure. How long do gamers have to go before Blizz listens ? Another 14 years? RIDICULOUS</div></div><hr />

I don't know, guys - given how many races that are pumped out, I feel like it takes away the quality on them. Just look at how Nightborne end up. ;_: Not to mention that some people (not me though) complain that they don't like how you obtain them and would rather have them included in the expansion and you can play it from the start. Which I think is fair when you haven't played for ages, then comes a new race that REALLY makes you want to play but you have to play a bunch of other things to even unlock it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Meh no thanks. Fell for that shit in Broken Shore with 7.2 and it's 14 weeks of &quot;story&quot;.<br />
<br />
You'll have a whole new set of world quests, unlike anything the team has done previously.<br />
<br />
Suuuuure we will....<br />
<br />
The team is pulling away from gating content with quests that require you to collect thousands of shards and instead focusing on big story quests that you can complete and feel like you got an awesome story reward for playing through a space.<br />
<br />
Correction. You are gating the story by weeks for no actual gameplay reason other than to keep that MAU count up. If there was actually a lore reason then fine. And no &quot;oh we must prepare&quot; is not a lore reason.<br />
<br />
It should feel like there is stuff happening all over the place.<br />
<br />
Then take a look at how other games do their event systems. The invasions on Argus were subpar at best. It was just a glorified scenario. Do a big event that builds up to a world boss among other things.<br />
<br />
Didnt take long for someone to lash out on ion again. So bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where in that post am I lashing out at Ion? And if you actually bothered to read the OP the dev interview is not even with Ion.<br />
<br />
It's criticism of the game and things they keep repeating and failing to do or things that really don't help the situation. On top of what I personally believe were subpar systems for world events. They can do better and they should be looking at how other games do big world events/zone events for inspiration.<br />
<br />
That's not me saying the game is bad. But according to you any form of criticism is &quot;lashing out&quot; right? You do know you can like the game and be critical at the same time yes? They are not mutually exclusive.</div></div><hr />

So far, all the raids and dungeons are about fighting Bosses with known mechanics and it is the same in all games. It would be nice to have a new model where bosses have AI and can run around, interupt you, stun the healer, on fear someone when he pops cooldowns or if he could run away.

Also rather than having Normal vs Heroic vs Mythic difference being only more boss health and 2 more mechanics, it would be that AI would be as strong but more responsive to counter our gameplay.</div></div><hr />

Dungeon and raid is about the things they do right in wow, and m+ is the best feature they've added since forever. IE and warfront is about as broken boring as it gets. It's like Ashran, but slighty better cause you can get it over and done faster. Zero immersion and just a chore really. They could test AI in there though, could be cool.</div></div><hr />

Warfront could be very cool if the base was actually controlled by 1 player. And that this player had the freedom to build as many barracks/stables/miners/lumberjack as he wants (just like playing regular warcraft3). And that the remaining 9 players were just heroes doing whatever they want to support the player win his RTS game (just like league of legend). And finally make it 10v10 players. And create a new pvp bracket for it. Man I would play this non-stop.</div></div><hr />

Everything seems rather straightforward, no risk taken, a new hub with World Quests, Invasions and Shrines, they don't seem to be willing to take risks anymore after the Azerite/Islands/Warfronts fiasco.<br />

I know, reading comprehension is difficult, but lets break it down.<br />
<br />
The world quests will be unlike anything we've seen in wow, cool awesome.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
THE ZONE EVENTS, will be like the legion invasions sort of. (Might I add the legion invasions were somewhat rewarding, at least for rep. if they can replicate them feeling rewarding it might actually feel like there is something constantly to do)<br />

It's not fake. It just screams insecurity. It is really obvious, but he thinks no one sees it. He knows he talks bullshit. He did the same with island expeditions.

The fact they can slap 3-4 hairstyles on a different color'd model, get people to pre-order the next expansion to get the privilege to unlock, and make people spend hundreds of hours playing the game to unlock it, then play even more to level one up, or fork out the cash to race change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the first interview that actually had some new ideas and hope.<br />
<br />
It's striking to me - salty even - to see so many devs speaking out NOW, when they were nowhere to be found during development of BfA. Is it a good sign? Depends on how much faith you have with Blizzard and the WOW team right now. From my perspective? Not any. They nuked a lot of bridges with the community, so I don't expect a couple of dev interviews to change things overnight. But they have to start somewhere. And, this is not exactly a great start, because it's more content that they are doing regardless of player's feelings and opinions. Islands are pretty much universally ignored if not outright hated, and from everything I've read, they're only done to catch up on Apexis...er...azerite power, or for a parrot mount. So instead of saying &quot;Oh, okay, we hear you, we'll focus less on that, and do something else&quot; they're doubling down on them. Woo. So much communication, right? Shouting at a brick wall has no effect - you're doing so much better, Bliz - the wall is higher! C'mon. All he did was tease some vague things, and we're all supposed to go &quot;Everything is perfect, here's my $15.&quot; Right? Right? <br />
<br />
2019 is going to be a pretty challenging year for Blizzard - they're facing lower numbers across the board with the lack of any big releases, so of course, they're sending the troops out to rally players. The one big juicy carrot they have to lure players back in, and keep them in, is new content (and mounts), so the cynical side of me just sees this as Feasel waving a shiny toy at players and going &quot;Look at the birdie!&quot;. <br />
<br />
And don't get all salty at my cynicism, they earned it. I've watched Blizzard and the WoW Dev team build hope and crush it utterly since WOD and it's fiasco, and failing to learn anything meaningful from it. And, with the Reign of Ion, it's only gotten worse. One dev interview with some shinies revealed isn't going to do much to stem the tide of anger and resentment Blizzard themselves created among their customers. People have every right to their feelings, these new &quot;emotions&quot; Ion recently discovered, and I always find it a bit rude when someone thinks they have the right to tell people how to feel.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
I think it's real but looks fake because he has no charisma.<br />
<br />
A lot of the devs are hard to read, because...well, they just tend towards certain personality types at times, and they're not hired for their personalities as much as their abilities. (Not trying to throw some hot button descriptive words around here) <br />
<br />
I actually have nothing against Jeremy, I just wish the CM team would get their act together and put a decent video interview studio together, with good camera angles, microphones, and lighting - but looking at the last minute put together effort they do for Ion, their game director, I'm not holding my breath. Podcasters all across the board have put together excellent studios - E&amp;T's video quality and production is excellent, as an example. <br />
<br />
Part of an effective PR strategy is maintaining quality across the board when the company speaks, and a lot of their devs are shown in a bad light, because of their lack of a platform for them to speak from. Jeremy would probably come across much better with a proper camera, mic, and setting. Plus, he doesn't look comfortable with that format, when E&amp;T do this kind of thing every day, and are comfortable and know how to present themselves effectively (plus, they have a theater background, no?)</div></div><hr />

Correction. You are gating the story by weeks for no actual gameplay reason other than to keep that MAU count up. If there was actually a lore reason then fine. And no &quot;oh we must prepare&quot; is not a lore reason.<br />

Then take a look at how other games do their event systems. The invasions on Argus were subpar at best. It was just a glorified scenario. Do a big event that builds up to a world boss among other things.<br />
<br />
I am hopeful that they learn their lessons, but i can't blame anyone for not trusting it given the amount of times they say those things. That said time gating needs to happen because players will burn through content like butter.

<br />
And yet other games don't need to do or do it with something lenient like a week or two.<br />
<br />
Timegating in this is literally to keep the MAU count up. Nothing more. It's a shit tier excuse and usually they put in a shit tier lore reason like &quot;oh we must prepare for the upcoming siege&quot; or some other nonsense.<br />
<br />
Timegating does not need to happen. There was no reason to gate Broken Shore for example by 14 weeks.<br />

Oh look FF14 ARR just released a new class which all you have to do is complete the ARR story line, with a new race coming in the new expansion which you can play day 1. Oh look ESO is releasing a new class in June which all you have to do is buy the expansion. Oh look BDO released a new class in Dec and all you had to do was own the game.<br />

Damn remember when all you had to do was own/sub to WoW for BE, Draenei, Worgen, Goblins and Pandas?, damn it's been that long since WoW was an actual good MMO.<br />

Sounds like a horrible idea of both FF14 and ESO. You aren't suppose to get everything for free in a game.<br />

They just need to release the new races already. And where the hell is the flying? Devs aren't even talking about it anymore?<br />
<br />
Please dont ruin the game by asking for flying. It ruined the other expansions after Classic allready</div></div><hr />

It's a fucking class lol. Yes you are supposed to have those as they are usually listed as main features of games/expansions.<br />
<br />
And by your own logic what WoW is doing is a &quot;horrible idea&quot; yes? Since that manages adding classes just like ESO does? Box price as a feature.<br />
<br />
And no races shouldn't be fucking &quot;earned&quot; either. Races and Classes are core concepts of games like these. <br />
<br />
There's a difference between &quot;getting everything for free&quot; and suitably rewarding content.<br />
<br />
I like how we've come so far now that people are saying Classes and Races have to be earned. And technically levelling to 50 to unlock Blue Mage in FF14 is earning something. You completed the main story quests of 2.0 therefore your reward is a Limited Job. As well as access to unlock Red Mage and Samurai if you own Stormblood as they are in ARR zones. And a sick ass looking Magitek Armor mount.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, its really a trip hearing crap like that now. Almost as if people are conditioned to put up with stuff that used to be basic parts of games back in yesteryear.</div></div><hr />

People like you are a cancer in MMORPGs and the reason why WoW is in a piss poor state right now.<br />
<br />
You know how many MMORPGs lock behind new races and jobs behind time gates? none, well except maybe Everquest 2 which they dropped that cause they even knew it was a stupid system.</div></div><hr />

The team loves the Allied Race system and thinks it is a strong system.<br />
And yet final idea execution continues, as originally did, have no story implementation logic (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2423895-None-of-BFA-selling-points-turned-out-to-be-competently-done?p=50017431&amp;viewfull=1#post50017431):<br />
- mustn't have opening &quot;requirements&quot; through other characters<br />
- chose mustn't have faction's limitations<br />
- main part of race must stay neutral/negative/friendly to both factions (no change to originals)<br />
...in a good case, what they have become now aren't &quot;allied&quot; races (talking about the original idea), but simply an additional races of this faction.<br />
<br />
Pandarens currently are only real allied (in the original idea) race.</div></div><hr />

Interesting. Last time I played FF14 (stormblood launch) I was forced to play through a RIDICULOUS amount of story content through ARR, ARR post content, heavenswards, and then heavensward post content (despite being level capped for the expansion I was currently working on) before I could even step foot into the new zones. I played probably 60 hours over 3-4 weeks and was soooo fucking burned out of doing that shit I quit before even reaching the new stormblood content.<br />
<br />
<br />
But that doesn't fit your anti-wow-circlejerk narrative so we should just ignore that.</div></div><hr />

Playing new mmorpgs that are good it's refreshing, and if you come burned as hell from wow even more, I still don't understand this mentality of &quot;fire this one!&quot; and so on, and when someone points that out it's like you don't like &quot;negative feedback&quot; when that is not feedback at all, just pure hate.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Terracresta</div><div class="date">2019-02-05, 09:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Daily quests were always annoying and boring.<br />
When they first mentioned Island Exploration, I wondered how they will pull it off. Knowing Blizzard I didn't expect much like actual exploration. Then they introduced it and I already knew it was going to but just another pointless grind and nothing else. Playing the introduction to IEs, I was so bored that I never touched this feature again...<br />
<br />
I'm unsubbed now, waiting for WoW Classic. Lets see if it's more than just nostalgia, but I fear it can't be the same as the community also changed, not just the game.<br />
<br />

Blind fanboy? Ignorant of reality? Never looked at how player numbers dropped?<br />
It's clearly not just the people complaining on forums, that think WoW is in a bad state or else we wouldn't this this drop in player numbers.</div></div><hr />
