Bornakk on Zul'aman<br />
Zul'Aman does have a fairly steep curve in difficulty, but having only two 10-person dungeons makes it so having a challenge like this in clearing it makes sense. This can also be seen as an example of why having separate progression paths for 10 and 25 person dungeons in Wrath of the Lich King will likely work out better.<br />
<br />
This dungeon can also be a pretty clear example of how Badge of Justice gear that you gather from running Karazhan and Zul'Aman can help get a group prepared to take things on. <br />
<br />
When Zul'Aman was released the &quot;bear runs&quot; were designed for players in high-end gear and at the time even they had issues completing it consistently if at all. Keep in mind that the game evolves over time and the players along with it and as they learn the strategies, what to kill, what the best order for things is, it all becomes easier.

World of Warcraft: Ashbringer # 1<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/june/wow-ashbringer_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/june/wow-ashbringer.jpg)&quot;Yes ! It is finally revealed ! Wildstorm and Blizzard Entertainment bring fans of the World of Warcraft MMORPG a spinoff Limited Series spanning four-issues telling one of the most craved in-game storylines: The Ashbringer. The name of Mograine is finally revealed. This story will strongly tie-in with the new quests in the upcoming World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the Lich King's plague of undeath ravages the human kingdom of Lordaeron, a mighty blade is forged from a dark orb! In the hands of Highlord Alexandros Mograine, the blade will become legend. In time, both blade and man will become . . . Ashbringer. In anticipation of the eagerly awaited game expansion, WORLD OF WARCRAFT: WRATH OF THE LICH KING, WildStorm and Blizzard have created this 4-issue miniseries written by Blizzard Creative Director Micky Neilson and featuring art by Ludo Lullabi and Tony Washington.<br />
<br />
This issue will feature two covers. For every 10 copies of the Standard Edition (with a cover by Chris Robinson), retailers may order one copy of the Variant Edition (with a cover by Lullabi and Washington).<br />
<br />
The comic will be on sale on September 10th. Make sure you read the full article on Blizzplanet.com for more details (http://www.blizzplanet.com/) !</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
what tone would that be?<br />
<br />
the &quot;we're being diplomatic, polite, slightly evasive, yet propagandistic&quot; tone?<br />
<br />
my guess is its b/c they need to be.</div></div><hr />
