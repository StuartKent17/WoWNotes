<meta name="description" content="The Hivemind Mount - Placeholder 
It turns out that The Hivemind was a placeholder, and didn't make it into the final game. 
The Hivemind mount was actually a placeholder during beta :) It's since been removed from data. The secret hunt is, however, far from over. Good luck! 
 
To clarify, that idea was super cool, but didn't make it into the shipping product. It might be seen again in the future.

are you just looking for threads where people are upset with blizzards decisions? seriously do you even play the game? i see you on the forums mocking everyone that dares say something bad about the game. get out of that basement now and then and stop being an ass instead of drinking all those &quot;salty fan tears&quot; . uh so pathetic</div></div><hr />

And here I thought it didn't because the place is a freaking deposit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh watch out boys. He called me an ass. :(<br />
<br />
Nah but usually you get the one or two people in here who get salty over this kind of thing and it's quite the amusing read. And yes if you get &quot;salty&quot; over the development process changing in a game with something so small such as a mount then you are quite frankly silly imo.<br />
<br />
And nah as of late it's been mostly getting amused by the endless whining. The people who when debated have to retort to &quot;white knight&quot; because a mature discussion is above them. Simple as that. I'm always up for discussion. I've happily stated my gripes with this expansion.<br />
<br />
As I said I will happily discuss the game with anyone. Good and bad. I just won't discuss with someone who uses &quot;white knight&quot; as a retort when debated. Nor would I with the actual white knights who think the game is the greatest thing since sliced bread. There's no winning with either side unless you share their one sided opinion.<br />
<br />
Note how I said both. White Knights are just as bad as endless whiners who provide no constructive feedback and spam &quot;ded game&quot; among other crap. I've dealt with both sides in other games besides WoW on this forum.<br />
