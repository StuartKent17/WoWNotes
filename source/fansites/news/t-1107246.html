100,000 Annual Pass Invites On Their Way<br />
We appreciate that everyone who signed up for the Annual Pass is genuinely excited about seeing the new content and helping us test it for release. We definitely want to get all Annual Pass holders into the beta test as soon as humanly (and technologically) possible.<br />
<br />
To do so, we need to make sure that our new systems remain stable as we add players. If we let everyone in at the exact same time, we risk damaging the stability of the service, and then no one would be able to play. We can’t let everyone in at the same time; however, all Annual Pass holders will be invited before any opt-ins.<br />
<br />
We’re in the process of sending 100,000 invites to Annual Pass holders, and we recommend keeping an eye on your email and Battle.net account for an invite to come explore Pandaria.<br />
<br />
Rest assured that we WILL get all of our Annual Pass holders into the beta test. Thank you for the passion and support you’ve shown for the game, and please be patient with us as we continue driving hard toward finishing up Mists of Pandaria and getting it into your hands as quickly as possible.</div></div><hr />

People will get their turns eventually. No amount of whining will do anything. Even if Blizzard wanted to do something, they can't. Because it's common sense the servers can't handle everyone at once. I suggest people who are whining just shut up and be patient. You have no choice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty sure this includes the ones from earlier. It takes a while to set up 100k accounts for access to the server as well as just sending 100k emails out. They probably staggered the invites on purpose so not everyone was trying to get in at the same time.</div></div><hr />

That'd be great, but I've a feeling that the breaks between beta invite waves will be longer than a week apart. I think maybe 2-3 weeks instead.<br />

Nope, i'll be getting in after you. I had to take off for a while from september to december for work/school. I signed back up with an AP, so i'm probably DFL, even though i've been playing since 8/06. Oh well, as long as i get to play and test some things, i'll be happy.</div></div><hr />

Sorry to burst your bubble (and mine and others'), but Kanegasi has pointed out a Twitter response from Bashiok.<br />

If you stopped paying your sub for one month in WoW, does that reset your active status? even if you've played for 8 years?<br />

<br />
Ok, so the people that say they are in but have not signed up for the AP (or just signed up recently) are trolling? Just wanted a confirmation on this, because I have seen posts saying otherwise.<br />
<br />
If someone is in the beta it is because:<br />
<br />
-They're press or work on an official fansite<br />
-Are friends/family of a Blizzard employee<br />
-Bought the Dell laptop that comes with beta invites<br />
-Purchased the Annual Pass<br />
<br />
There have been no opt-in invites.<br />
<br />
<br />

Thank you kindly for the compliment. ;)<br />

:P And don't I know it. Meanwhile, Alayea was also shouting out &quot;I'm first comment!&quot;<br />
Traitor. *pbbbbbbbbbbbbt*<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Here's some more commenting by Bashiok.<br />
<br />
The invites started earlier today and are still being sent. It will take at least a few more hours to finish, and then tomorrow morning we'll see if there were any that bounced back and resend those, as well as email alerting people to them being invited. Inviting 100k takes a long time. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways you can tell us what all you look for when you Invite? Besides How old account is and when we purchased AP?<br />
<br />
Annual Pass is a guaranteed entry, there is no consideration made beyond cumulative subscription time and when the Annual Pass was purchased.</div></div><hr />

However, I think it is about damn time that Blizzard released an official statement about their plans. They haven't said anything for over a week which has only made the situation worse. At least by saying this people know what the plan is and I think we will see a reduction in all the &quot;Where's my beta&quot; threads. Of course there will be some but that's because impatient people are impatient.</div></div><hr />

From what I can see, not counting all the &quot;free&quot; days from RAF and etc., I have about 4 and a half years of paid game time. Add another 7 months to that if we count the other stuff. Hopefully it's enough to get somewhere during the next wave or so. :)</div></div><hr />

I'm sure it will be a significantly higher number than 97, but you're right in the fact it wont be anywhere near the 100,000.</div></div><hr />

They said roughly 45mins ago or so that there was going to be invites still going out for another 3 or so hours ...<br />

So we've probably still got around another 2hours of invites being sent out.</div></div><hr />

Did you have an active account since the beginning? As in, you paid every month since 2004?<br />
If not, it's based on cumulative active time. My account was created in March 2005, but I only have 5.3 years (64 months) of active time (took breaks here and there)</div></div><hr />

<br />
a game launch has everything prepared and tested before and its just an early access but its basically just a staggered launch. this isn't a staggered launch this is a beta. they can make 8 billion server but because its untested there could be a flaw in each server that causes a complete shut down on systems<br />
<br />
they need to test things out before people come in. they start out small like many betas and as more people get in the fasters beta invites go out. more people= more people possibly able to break and report things to help the game improve and free up more space and less time to fix each bug because they don't have to fix bugs on 1000 realms just a small number at first.<br />
<br />
farther along beta goes less bugs so more servers can be open</div></div><hr />

Is inviting in waves logical when they have known for months how many people they had? No, logical would be to look at how many people they have and try to estimate how many servers they would need. Logical would be to have a plan on how to handle beta rather than admit a couple days before the beta goes live &quot;we have no idea how we'll do it.&quot; The only way saying this is a &quot;logical approach,&quot; is if you admit that they utterly failed to begin with and are now taking the only logical approach left.</div></div><hr />

My source tells me, that people who are in and don't have AP are either lying or are forgetting to mention that they have been invited thanks to F&amp;F (or obviously thanks to being popular, which is not mutually exclusive). With the 1M annual passes they will have way (about 100 times) more people than they need making any kind of opt-in based invites very unlikely.</div></div><hr />

I'm just purely stating that you can't compare a Early Access Launch of a game to a Beta... You can't ... It's a stupid Comparison. Getting 1million people into your game with 50 servers over the course of a week compared to getting people into Beta servers in Waves..

It's fairly logical if you consider that Blizzard never ever throws money at stuff, if they can get away with not doing it. And they can. So they won't. Hence, it is logical that they use a minimum of servers required for testing and getting all AP holders in to beta before it ends and hopefully as soon as possible. Even if they don't want to throw money at stuff, they still don't want to piss their customers off too much either. I just thought it was logical they would do that. I wouldn't throw money at a problem in my line of work. That would mean the customer would end up having to pay more to get it done faster than &quot;normal deadline&quot;, or my company losing money. And that's no good.</div></div><hr />

Shit, at this point I'd be happy with a D3 beta too. 1/3 of the reason I wanted to sign up for the AP anyway. 1 was because I planned on playing WoW, 2 was for D3 and 3 was for the MoP beta. So far...I'm 1 for 3. Terrible odds there. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
They know people can &quot;fight back&quot; and have told them exactly how, they've made it clear that you can phone customer services and just opt out of the scheme. If people are cancelling their sub over not getting access to the 1-10 pandaren leveling zone beta on day 1, then they obviously weren't the people willing to play for 1 year, the annual pass wasn't made for them and they shouldn't have bought it.<br />
<br />
On topic, 7 year old account with 7months inactive at one point during classic, still no invite. Still don't particularly care since I'm more tech savvy than a turnip, so knew day 1 invites for everyone was impossible.</div></div><hr />

lol you really need to think about what you are saying. You are basically making my argument for me. You are saying they can't be compared becuase of the number of servers?

And still there is zero logic in your argument. 4 servers + 1 million people = failure. It doesn't matter whether they wait a week, they are still going to need more servers in order to get 1 milion people in. The 1 million is not going to magically become a lower number that will fit into 4 servers as time goes by. The fact is they didn't plan well. Heck they admitted themselves they had no idea how they would handle beta just days prior to it going live. They utterly failed is the only explanation and now the only course of action they have is waves.</div></div><hr />

Only difference between the initial wave they did last week and the one for cata was they called it F&amp;F Beta this time instead of F&amp;F Alpha, which is what it actually was. Now beta has started. They can start waves and stress test the servers. Waves should be coming out rather regularly now as long as there isn't a huge issue found with this wave.

(which it is right?) edit: 1 month 15 days ...possibly decent consolation prize if it doesn't mean i can expect to wait 1 month 15 days for a mop beta invite &lt;.&lt; ...plus 17gigs of precious HD space is alright taken with pre-downloaded mop beta files =(<br />
<br />
You DO realise the diablo bit is a seperate post entirely right? It's just linked at the top.<br />
<br />
This is about the MoP beta that all the whiney self entitled brats have been bitching about since 5 minutes after it started and they weren't in. (mods: You can't say i'm wrong).</div></div><hr />

Please source this quote. I was invited previously and am definitely not F&amp;F. So unless I have a little angel watching out for me with my e-mail... :P</div></div><hr />

Yes, WoW needs more Blizzard drones like you, who are willing to pay a lot of money to them with out getting back what they were promised ;)</div></div><hr />

I'm definitely not F&amp;F or press/fansite. I've taken part in most previous beta's though so might have ended up on the &quot;approved testers&quot; list.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daverid</div><div class="date">2012-03-30, 06:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol you really need to think about what you are saying. You are basically making my argument for me. You are saying they can't be compared becuase of the number of servers? Who's fault is it that Blizzard used 4 servers when beta went live? They knew months in advance how many people had AP and they put 4 servers out...<br />
<br />
Hahahaha oh I get it ... You're someone who thinks that Blizzard should have had 50 servers up on Day 1 Beta and invited every single AP holder..<br />
<br />
Ok sure... Keep living that Sweet life of Being Moronic. BioWare had alot of people in Beta ... Even on the Open Beta weekends they DID NOT have 50 servers running.<br />
<br />
Blizzard SHOULD have made it clear that we were going to get invites in Waves BEFORE they announced the Beta. <br />
They SHOULD have made it clear AP holders would get in before all Opt-Ins BEFORE they announced the Beta.<br />
<br />
I definitely think Blizzard lacked Communication in this whole Scenario instead of just Springing it on everyone During and after the Beta Announcement...<br />
<br />
But even with that aside... You can't seriously think, and have expected, Blizzard to be hosting countless Beta servers and inviting 1million People into the Buggy and Unstable Patch/Servers ON DAY ONE. Hell they could have put 1 server up and invited only Press and still been well within their rights, would still have been disheartening, but definitely Within their Rights.</div></div><hr />

The problem is with the people who have too low standards for the quality of the services they pay for. Of course if mommy and daddy are giving you the money you don't care... maybe you should try to work and earn them to understand the issue.</div></div><hr />

I really doubt it, there is still around 7-800k out there that will be crying for their beta keys.</div></div><hr />
