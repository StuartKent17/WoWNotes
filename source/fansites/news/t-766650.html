Good god... WHY?<br />
Ok, the first KC nerf was called for. It hits NORMAL now, thank you very much. Why are you nerfing it again? The Focus Fire nerf doesn't make any sense at all, and the BW nerf is just way over the top.<br />
<br />
Marksmanship? Eh? MM sucks atm, yes, you can spam Arcane Shot because Chimera Shot sucks but that justifies an Arc Shot nerf, not a Wild Quiver nerf. As for survival... No words. Just no words. Survival is way way way undertuned at the moment, and they nerf it?<br />

QFT, althought the mastery nerf seems a bit over the top. What they should've nerfed are the pet basic (or special??) attack scaling.<br />

rogues buffed &lt;check&gt;<br />
hunters nerfed &lt;check&gt;<br />
warriors nerfed &lt;check&gt;<br />
<br />
What is GC logic? cause i can see none, literally none in his actions to warrs hunters and rogues...<br />
He buffs rogues in dmg, sure, why not... its not like rogues deal high dmg right? right?. But where in the name of god is nerf to recuperate?<br />
this shit heals over 60% hp over 30 secs when properly talented and gives rogues energy regen like with permament adrenaline rush :S<br />
<br />
He destroys bm yet again. KC was the problem, no doubt, but rest? i mean focus fire nerf? seriously?<br />
bestial wrath nerf?! let me guess... because KC was hitting too hard? rofl... this dude proves yet again that he has no idea about hunters. I jsut wonder how in the name of god he managed to become lead designer.<br />
<br />
MM changes are good but aimed shot and chimera shot are still way too weak for their cost and MM overall dmg is still weak.<br />
<br />
Survival nerf is like.... wait, what? Does he even know how to balance game? you dont nerf everything or nerf by huge ammounts, you nerf by small ammounts to see how it works... is this guy a plumber or something? cause it seems to me that he flushed his balance sense down the toilet<br />
<br />
Then the mothership of stupidity.<br />
Problem? ms being way too weak for 30 rage attack and being much weaker than slam which for its rage cost, has decent damage. <br />
Proper fix? buff the hell out of ms <br />
GC fix? decrease slightly rage cost of ms and increase rage cost of slam... seriously... <br />
<br />
Tough i think the most pointless and dumb change has to be bloodthirst nerf... How 3% hp each 4.5 sec (assuming you keep BT on cd and you keep hitting your enemy) is in any way strong? <br />
Arms and fury survival is pathetic and i mean really pathetic, yet he wants to nerf it wherever he can...<br />
<br />
Tough i fear that only thing he can do is buff rogues and mages whenever he can and give warrior abilities to every pet in game...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And can we finally get those sweet enchants working when hitting with ranged attacks? scopes arent rly iteresting, nor are passive stat increasing enchants...</div></div><hr />

All indication are that BM Hunters were OP and Combat Rogues UP, and they got nerfed/buffed respectively. Lots of the other changes look like similar tweaks to iron out performance issues. At least from the point of view of class balance and play changes they seem to be getting really close. <br />
<br />
To the Bm people: relax. Spec was OP on beta, now they're nerfing to fix it. If the nerf was too hard, they can adjust back up. Unless OP was what you wanted, in which case you're most likely screwed.</div></div><hr />

1. They nerfed KC from 63% to 11%. This was TOO MUCH. They buffed it back up to 63%. NOW, they've nerfed it down to 35%.<br />
2. They BUFFED Wild Quiver a lot. Re-read the patch notes.<br />
3. Yes, they nerfed Survival's mastery. No, this is only one of the very first number passes. I'm sure they'll buff Explosive Shot or compensate Survival in a another way soon. It's likely that the mastery was scaling too well, so they had to nerf it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The adjusting of abilities in beta is balancing, not nerfing.<br />
the beta doesn't have the Arcane Shot nerf (or at least id didn't few days ago), so BM DPS was much highier because of AS spam instead of using Kill Command<br />
<br />
with this build BM hunters won't have ANY high damaging shot (also a very very low DPS)<br />
<br />
since the first build they have:<br />
-Arcane shot nerfed (to the ground)<br />
-Kill Command nerf (from something around 50% to 35%)<br />
-Bite/Claw/Smack from 14% to 8%<br />
-Animal Handler from 25% to 15%<br />
-Bestial Wrath from 50% to 20%<br />
-Focused Fire CD doubled<br />
-both Mastery base buff and scaling nerfed<br />
<br />
roughly...umh... 50-60% DPS nerf since the first build? i haven't seen any hunter doing 25k+ DPS at level 85 a lot of classes can go over 15k easily<br />
<br />
a 20-30% was expected, but this is really too much<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. Mastery: Wild Quiver now grants a 14.4% (down from 16%) chance for your ranged attacks to also instantly fire an additional ranged shot for 100% normal damage (up from 50%). Each point of Mastery increases the chance by 1.8%, down from 2%.<br />
now with even more awesome RNG contents!<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
# Aimed Shot base damage increased by 14%<br />
really, this is a fucking joke<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
# Tailspin now lasts 30 sec, up from 8 sec. Cooldown changed to 25 sec, down from 40 sec.<br />

He destroys bm yet again. KC was the problem, no doubt, but rest? i mean focus fire nerf? seriously?<br />
bestial wrath nerf?! let me guess... because KC was hitting too hard? rofl... this dude proves yet again that he has no idea about hunters. I jsut wonder how in the name of god he managed to become lead designer.<br />
<br />
MM changes are good but aimed shot and chimera shot are still way too weak for their cost and MM overall dmg is still weak.<br />
<br />
Survival nerf is like.... wait, what? Does he even know how to balance game? you dont nerf everything or nerf by huge ammounts, you nerf by small ammounts to see how it works... is this guy a plumber or something? cause it seems to me that he flushed his balance sense down the toilet<br />
<br />
Then the mothership of stupidity.<br />
Problem? ms being way too weak for 30 rage attack and being much weaker than slam which for its rage cost, has decent damage. <br />
Proper fix? buff the hell out of ms <br />
GC fix? decrease slightly rage cost of ms and increase rage cost of slam... seriously... <br />
<br />
Tough i think the most pointless and dumb change has to be bloodthirst nerf... How 3% hp each 4.5 sec (assuming you keep BT on cd and you keep hitting your enemy) is in any way strong? <br />
Arms and fury survival is pathetic and i mean really pathetic, yet he wants to nerf it wherever he can...<br />
<br />
Tough i fear that only thing he can do is buff rogues and mages whenever he can and give warrior abilities to every pet in game...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And can we finally get those sweet enchants working when hitting with ranged attacks? scopes arent rly iteresting, nor are passive stat increasing enchants...<br />
<br />
all the rogue buffs were combat spec buffs which they admitted in a blue post before that combat damage for rogues was too low.</div></div><hr />

I'm thinking late November or *very* early December if they're starting the arena season on the 14th. People have to be able to level to 85 and get at least basic PvP gear.

<br />
Not saying Boub is wrong, just curious where the &quot;one week or less&quot; idea comes from.<br />

People will still be leveling up their 80's so it would make no sense to say you think the release of Cata is also in December. People need more time to level up. I would wager 2 or 3 weeks before the arena season starts will be when the expansion is released.<br />

Many High schools/Colleges (you know, the majority of the player base?) Is either busy finishing up projects and getting ready for finals or starting final exams. Aside from that, its the end of the year, things get busy at work. Thats not even taking into account the effect of the holiday busyness (is that a word?) and vacations. <br />
<br />
From personal experience, I can say that most ex-WoW players I know are planning on coming back to at least give cataclysm a try. It really does look promising so far. However, also from experience, I can say that starting in on the expansion a month late is FAR less fun than getting into it on the launch day since I started BC a month late and Wotlk the day it came out. They would probably be much better off just waiting til January if they cant get it done in November since all those people who will cry about it are going to buy it regardless of the release date.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not in the Dungeon Finder. I was under the impression that the actual gear was going to be colour accented to the role as well. Just a bit here or there so that the same models being used still looked a tad different (ie. instead of recolours for t11, t11.25 and t11.5 - was hoping each new tier would be new models instead... even if ever so slight.)</div></div><hr />

Ok, the first KC nerf was called for. It hits NORMAL now, thank you very much. Why are you nerfing it again? The Focus Fire nerf doesn't make any sense at all, and the BW nerf is just way over the top.<br />
<br />
Marksmanship? Eh? MM sucks atm, yes, you can spam Arcane Shot because Chimera Shot sucks but that justifies an Arc Shot nerf, not a Wild Quiver nerf. As for survival... No words. Just no words. Survival is way way way undertuned at the moment, and they nerf it?<br />

If this goes live I'll be playing my Priest as my main this expac, thank you.<br />

<br />
Here's what the numbers are now looking like with very little mastery on gear:<br />
<br />
* Beast mastery Mastery contributes around 13% of the total hunter + pet DPS.<br />
* Marksman Mastery contributes around 1.6% of the total hunter + pet DPS.<br />
* Survival Mastery contributes around 16% of the total hunter + pet DPS.<br />
<br />
At the start we see that MM mastery is very low. This is particularly sad since MM is also by far the lowest DPS spec at the moment. But here's the thing: mastery doesn't scale evenly for each spec. SV is getting a bit more advantage from its mastery than BM, but what happens when we start stacking on the gear?<br />
<br />
Here's what the number look like up around 1,500 mastery rating:<br />
<br />
* Beast mastery Mastery contributes around 19% of the total hunter + pet DPS.<br />
* Marksman Mastery contributes around 3.5% of the total hunter + pet DPS.<br />
* Survival Mastery contributes around 30% of the total hunter + pet DPS.<br />
<br />
taken from frostheim's tests. search scattered shots hunter mastery on wow insider.<br />
<br />
it was gonna end up that all SV would want was mastery, MM wouldnt want any, and BM couldnt care less either way.</div></div><hr />

1. The blue post said &quot;approximately&quot; one week after. Therefor, the Xpac could still happen before Dec. 7th<br />
2. After BC launched, season 1 began TWO weeks later.<br />
3. After LK launched, season 5 began OVER 1 month later.<br />

Oh the irony of calling someone a moron for not reading the blue post correctly.<br />
<br />
Not sure where you're from, but approximately does not mean guaranteed or official. So stating Dec. 7th as the official release date for Cataclysm is not reliable until it's made by Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

What you're not understanding is that the definition of approximately is entirely irrelevant.<br />
<br />
As it stands, the file says the start date is the 14th.<br />
<br />
Now, thanks to the fact the blue post said AFTER, the only direction for release you can go is ON OR BEFORE DECEMBER 7th.<br />

Are you dense?<br />
<br />
The only thing that is fact is the blue post. Approximately one week after Cataclysm is out.<br />
<br />
December 14th is when the new Arena Season starts. That's another piece of info we have. <br />
<br />
One week is all we have. That places the date on 7th.<br />
<br />
The word approximately is irrelevant - this means IF the date for the new season is indeed the 14th, then we're looking at the 7th AS THE LATEST DATE. The better way to phrase it would have been &quot;the 14th is a placeholder date&quot;, not go into some retarded explanation on the word approximately. We're not 4th graders.<br />
<br />
That moron, thanks to &quot;don't get excited yet&quot; seemed to imply that it was going to be later than December 7th.<br />
<br />

Based on the fact that Season 9 will start about 1 week after Cataclysm release, as stated by a Blue. But, what apparently some or most folks don't seem to see, the date 14th December as start of Season 9 is taken from the game files. And stuff in game files can allways be a placeholder of some sort. Nothing that originates from datamining is officially set in stone. So in conclusion, there is no guaranty, no official info that Cata will be released around December 7th. I know, it's easy to jump on the bandwaggon of &quot;omg omg there's an official date fuck yeah!&quot;. And to be honest, I myself find it highly likely that the date will turn out to be correct, but only based on the trust Boub could build up over the years when it comes to things like release dates and such. Nevertheless, it's allways smart to not stop thinking for yourself and review the given information with a calm mind.<br />

<br />
Oooooo new race class/combos? still have to level them in the extremely outdated and boring old world, then what? make another alt when 4.0.3/Cata is released? Maybe one of the new race sure, but again then you would have 2 characters leveling (if you are not insane and already have the alt to 80) plus leveling the your previous 80 to 85 and keeping up with endgame when people settle there. Some people may like to work on 3-4 characters at once I guess but for me cataclysm is useless until 4.0.3 because I am done with the old world and have the alts I want until the new classes. <br />
It's weird that they can add minimal stuff to the game but still make it so boring just so idiots can pay for a subscription (not me, already canceled months ago) while they dangle the real cataclysm for several more months because they can't program their game properly.<br />
<br />
I know it was kinda done with WotLK but it seems now that actual expansions are becoming less and less important top buy seeing as they making more and more of the content free patches anyways (JC couldn't be done without BC but Inscription could be done without WotLK, now with cata there's free Archeology, free world changes, and more). Pretty soon everything will be a free patch and people will be merely paying $60-$80 for a code only, i'm not knocking free stuff, but they are really making paying for these &quot;expansions&quot; kinda useless, they are more and more just holding the minimum back so we can fork out an extra $60 for a large patch (which i guess is kinda the bare essence of an expansion). Basically, like I said I'm not knocking free stuff really it's the method these expansions are taking. The install times are all there and they always will be so might as well bundle them and make people actually pay for something worthwhile rather than bare minimum. <br />
<br />
And boo hunter nerfs, sure let rogues stun lock, 2-3 shot players and have one of the best DPS on PVE encounters, Give paladins 3 (yes, 3, 1 more than lock or DK) mounts when other classes have none, and always keep them well buffed in patches, let druids destroy in healing and dps but God forbid hunters do well in their one option of as a class over any other class in anything (I would maybe say mages get just as bad DPS ignoring from Blizz, they are good at PVP though, but the rest certainly outclass easily in PVE) Although I won't be ignorant enough to say I never see good DPS from a hunter from time to time but it certainly isn't given to them like other classes get *cough* Paladin *cough*<br />
<br />
Edit: Also just saw the Dec 7th release date.<br />
1) surprised an actual date may have (didn't actually check authenticity) actually set a date for their ever-in-development cataclysm<br />
2) Taking all bets that it will not even be released the week of Dec 7th</div></div><hr />

Ok, the first KC nerf was called for. It hits NORMAL now, thank you very much. Why are you nerfing it again? The Focus Fire nerf doesn't make any sense at all, and the BW nerf is just way over the top.<br />
<br />
Marksmanship? Eh? MM sucks atm, yes, you can spam Arcane Shot because Chimera Shot sucks but that justifies an Arc Shot nerf, not a Wild Quiver nerf. As for survival... No words. Just no words. Survival is way way way undertuned at the moment, and they nerf it?<br />

We're in beta/ptr, and yes feedback is the purpose of this stage in cataclysm's development, not whining about numbers and fine-tuned percentages we haven't even seen in action yet.

<br />
Nowhere in the blue post here on MMOChamp nor on the source it links to do I see the words. &quot;That means Cataclysm release is Dec. 7th.&quot; Jeez you believe everything you hear? he could be assuming himself and he could be in trouble for making that statement (this info is still new). IF Blizz made an official announcement on thier website (not forum) then I'd be more inclined to believe but even still I wouldn't 100% go with it. Blizzard is pretty much famous for never keeping dates, the very few times they actually ouright state them (which is not the case here)<br />
<br />
You sir are blinded by dumb faith (in a company that deserves/earned none) in what could well be a slip of the tongue (fingers?). We are all waiting for this expansion while they dribble about us but that is no reason to be dumb.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what &quot;+Arena_master_no_season_text =&quot; means but unless a robot that runs blizzard said it at an official announcement, seems to be very untrustworthy. and if its something from data mining or something, it can most definitely be changed anytime therefore making this prediction of Dec 7th invalid.</div></div><hr />

Blue confirmed new class combos will come out in 4.0.3 so yes itll save me money being able to level a new toon. Hopefully 4.0.3 will come out soon enough before Cataclysm so I can have plenty of time to level before 80+ content will be relevant.</div></div><hr />

...why? Just why? It was a decent tanking enchant, not SUPER high, but worth getting for PvP and maybe bear tanks. Now it's just a &quot;gimmick&quot; like Engineering was back in classic. Are we backsliding? I mean, I'm not going to whine &quot;Oh, Blizz is making engineers horrible again&quot; because seriously, those hydro pump/cogwheel things are AWESOME.

<br />
Rogue combat changes are going in a similar direction, good to see them buffing abilities that you consciously have to use(finishing moves and SS) instead of more auto-attack power.<br />
<br />
BM hunters got nerfed pretty ridiculously but I'm willing to bet good money it'll be buffed up to par by December 7th, you still have a long ways to go and alot more builds.<br />
<br />
Personally as prot warrior I was kind of hoping they would buff the threat components on our abilities instead of just saying &quot;click this stance and you'll hold threat now&quot;, but oh well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except that Amazon are wrong. Always wrong.<br />
<br />
The only reason they would have pushed their estimated release date back to January is most likely because they can't supply everyone with copies, and had to compensate by delaying their own shipping dates etc.<br />
<br />
It's happened before. I'd trust this NPC text more than Amazon.<br />
<br />
Besides it fits snugly into the timeframe Boub mentioned. Any later than December 7th and Blizzard would really be shooting themselves in the foot.<br />
<br />
Besides, nobody besides Blizzard knows the actual release date for anything Blizzard develops. You should KNOW this by now.</div></div><hr />

All indication are that BM Hunters were OP and Combat Rogues UP, and they got nerfed/buffed respectively. Lots of the other changes look like similar tweaks to iron out performance issues. At least from the point of view of class balance and play changes they seem to be getting really close. <br />
<br />
To the Bm people: relax. Spec was OP on beta, now they're nerfing to fix it. If the nerf was too hard, they can adjust back up. Unless OP was what you wanted, in which case you're most likely screwed.<br />
<br />
and by screwed he means: you will need to roll a priest/mage/rogue. <br />
<br />
We have dealt with an entire fcking expansion dominated in pvp by a few classes. Nice to see nothing is changing in cata</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep paladins, Rogues and Druids can faceroll themselves into being OP but the second Hunters start doing some damage they crank it back down to nothing. God forbid hunters do well in their niche of dealing damage, while rogues stunlock then 2 shot people, Druids heal up a storm (while having redic tree armor buff for no reason) and can still handle tanking, high dps (boomkin and cat), and run unrestrained in PVP (change form solves all). And then there's Blizzards baby-child, Paladins, being hand-fed all the attention and buffs they desire to faceroll their way through the game, only holding back slightly when it becomes overly obvious. Camouflage is barely a start, especially when lots of people don't even play PVP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's because hunters were still very powerful. If you played on beta you'd have known just how strong they are. It's not okay when hunters could potentially do twice as high DPS as the other classes.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Reroll those classes then, and see how good it actually is on the other side. Hunters were overpowered, there's nothing more to it. <br />
<br />
By the way, druids can't do all those things at once, we have to both spec and gear for it, so don't be a moron.<br />
<br />
You say lots of people don't pvp at the end, but before that you're complaining that other classes are good at pvp (????).</div></div><hr />

i don't say it won't happen on those dates but, until there are blue anouncements, anything related to release date is just a mere speculation. nothing more. nothing less.<br />

Oh hi, you must be new around these parts. Let me fill you in. Not every tree (lol tree) is viable for every class. Resto druids are so OP, you should enjoy the fact that you have your face roll to gladiator spec. You should be happy that Balance thanks to Blizzard purposely breaking Starfall has made Boomkins viable in 3's/5's. You have a class that has what is basically 4 different roles, don't expect them all to be viable in PVP. There are many classes that have one, READ ONE usable PVP spec. I'm trying to decide if Hunters or Druids are the new &quot;MAGE QQ&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Every other class got something new, but mages got a new icon, and in those days the only reason to bring a mage was, decursing and water, because mages couldn't output any kind of competetive dps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dunno if u played recently at least on the ptr but other classes hit harder than pet does with 2 cds. 40k easymode mindblast word of death crits sp combo(while having 1500 resil). 30k starsurge with eclipse balance druid when all the stars align but who cares right(main is balance druid). You people need 2 learn to pvp which means treat the pet as a player opposed to y he should hit for nothing I'm just gonna let him hit me instead of running or ccing him.<br />
<br />
Guess the easiest way to fix all the excess dmg we got in wotlk is nerf everything to the ground. Seen some of tb's vids while he plays on his mage(lvl 85)18-19k fireballs with probably mastery ratings and all isn't that much. <br />
<br />
New form of balance is lower damage, more time to respond. At least this is what Blizz seems to be going for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe so, but after so many nerfs they're prolly as bad as they are on live servers. And I hope BM would be a viable raiding build again.<br />
<br />
Kinda funny actually. Let Kill Command scale by 63%. No wait, let it scale by 35% instead. Or not, its too low. Let's put it back to 63%. Oh no, it's doing too much damage again. Lets put it back to 35% instead!</div></div><hr />

Marksmanship? Eh? MM sucks atm, yes, you can spam Arcane Shot because Chimera Shot sucks but that justifies an Arc Shot nerf, not a Wild Quiver nerf. As for survival... No words. Just no words. Survival is way way way undertuned at the moment, and they nerf it?<br />

note the LESS than... ok... now read this blue:<br />
//forums wow-europe com/thread.html?topicId=14574469135&amp;sid=4&amp;pageNo=1<br />
<br />
It's an Spanish blue, well... it's THE spanish blue... saying:<br />
Según los gnomos, las posibilidades de que haya un cataclismo son del 12.6% (sólo tenéis que hacer la Operación: Gnomeregan para poder leerlo con vuestros propios ojos).<br />
<br />
Y no seré yo quién ponga en duda la palabra de los gnomos :-) <br />

Traduction:<br />

<br />
We were way overpowered a few builds ago because of how insane Kill Command was and we could talent it to have no CD. Then they changed the cooldown reduction to increased critical chance, and we were critting it at around 70-75k at 85. Then they nerfed its base damage down and it was perfectly inline with the other specs. These new changes seem like way too much now. It looks like Blizzard has decided that the WotLK hunter model of having two viable DPS specs is the way they wanna go, despite what the majority of the community has asked for. This added on to me not liking the feel of any of my Death Knight's trees anymore (Unholy is getting to a place that feel right) means that I'll be going with my shammy or mage for Cataclysm. Its not a big deal or anything, I was just really wanting to raid as Beast Mastery.</div></div><hr />
