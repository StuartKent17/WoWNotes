Blizzard has hotfixed Blood-Soaked Tome of Dark Whispers to drop from Zul on Normal difficulty and up. It was discovered yesterday that it would drop for Hunters that Hearthstoned out during the fight, but this was unintended. This item allows Hunters to tame the Blood Beasts added in Battle for Azeroth.

That can’t be the case, because they sent out the tweet hint about how to get it way after it would’ve been obvious that it wasn’t working.</div></div><hr />

Something in the fight probably set off some flag that caused you to be ineligible. Hearthing out mustve have either reset that flag or caused it not to trigger. Ideally Blizz wouldve have set it so that hearthing also made you ineligible and you would have to be present for the kill in order to obtain the tome.</div></div><hr />

According to the wow dev twitter it was supposed to drop from only Heroic Zul if you beat him with only hunters in the raid. A.K.A might as well have not been put in at all.</div></div><hr />

I wonder if it counts the hunters at the beginning of the fight or once he dies? Might've been able to have everyone but the hunters hearth at a few percent left?</div></div><hr />

yer i gotta be honest i cannot have imagined a worse way to implement it then an all hunter heroic zul kill, no way that would be toxic</div></div><hr />

Yup that's basically saying it was intended nobody get this until the expansion was done and people went back after it next expansion when they overgeared it aka stupid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I agree we could use more spirit beast, I do not think this is the expansion for it. With all of the other new hunter pets added it may be a bit overboard, especially since spirit beast are now all tanks they have lost a little of the excitement.</div></div><hr />

- dinos - farm elites on Oondasta's island (I think it was soloable even when current) <br />

Getting 1 pet could be hidden behind challenge or secret, but a whole family? <br />

And tbh not everyone is a raider, so a solo challenge (like Fenryr tame) is more fair to everyone than requiring a full raid.</div></div><hr />

My guess is it was treated too much like a 'secret' so in came the convoluted method, when secrets and raiding don't really mix (was a lot of complaining in the secrets discord). Creator probably saw some all X class videos in the past. Even if they had come out from the start and said this is how to do it, I'd imagine it'd just be carry groups making bank on it with a lockout</div></div><hr />

<br />
Island Expeditions it took them like 4 months after release, a buff to the drop rates, and a complete revamp of the system to explain how the loot dropped from there.<br />
Warfronts were HORRIBLY communicated to the community, with expectations changing completely when it first launched<br />
Weekly Chests thought to have a chance to drop Azerite / Normal Piece / Weapon<br />
<br />
So many undocumented changes as well.<br />
<br />
Stuff like the Draenei Girl or the Brain Mount, those are &quot;OK&quot;. a hunter pet though? Why does that need this super secret hush hush bullshit?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why don't they just make the argus mythic mount available for everyone without having to do it on mythic? Its just a mount, not everyone is interested in organized content.<br />
<br />
Why don't they just make old weapon mogs available to everyone... bla bla bla...<br />
<br />
Because it adds prestige! When you see someone going by with one of the pets as a hunter you think to yourself &quot;OH, That pet is awesome! I want that pet! Let me look up how to get it!&quot;<br />
<br />
You figure out how to get it and you set a goal for yourself. Setting goals for yourself is what makes an mmo tick. The more things added to be obtainable by everyone in a spliffy, the less goals people set, the less the game functions.<br />
<br />
When I saw the mythic argus mount for the first time I loved that thing. So I set out on an adventure and went hard on the raiding mythic. In the end I didn't achieve my goal, but I became a lot better player, made a ton of friends along the way and still look back fondly on what I tried.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Considering how you snipped down my post, dunno what to expect beyond here but alright...<br />
<br />
The argument stands very much related. You see something visual, a pet, a mount, a transmog. You think its awesome, you go on a journey to get it. Thats the simple thing that makes the game work. This hunter pet thing is the same. Clearly you want it else you wouldn't ask for blizzard to hand it to you. Instead of asking them to lower the bar, instead you train so you can jump over the bar and stop crying that its all to hard because you don't want to do anything involving other people in an mmo.<br />
<br />
If organized content or interacting with other to achieve your goals is not what you enjoy, sorry to break it to ya, but an MMO might just not be your type of game.<br />
<br />
Granted, I don't expect anything longer that a &quot;/10 char&quot; post as rebuttal. But oh well. I had some time to kill before christmas.</div></div><hr />

It's not too hard nor is that even the point. Raiding isn't difficult and it never has been... not sure why you're talking to me like I'm some child new to the game in need of tips or motivation.<br />
<br />
My issue is them locking something silly like taming a pet behind this specific &quot;wall&quot; when in the past similar things have not been behind it. Others walls sure - which worked just fine when considering not everyone is interested in organized content i.e. raiding. So why start now? Why for a pet? Why Zul? And considering it's not even that special of a pet when the entire zone of Nazmir is full of em' why Crawgs?.<br />
<br />
Questioning things is not crying. I don't even play a hunter :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
So, sorry to break it you, but your argument is still - like it was before; dumb.<br />
<br />
<br />
edit; Being &quot;good&quot; isn't a priority for alot of players &amp; not everyone is interested in having a bar to jump over. People who raid are not the only players out there ;/ What about people who exclusively do PvP/RP/Petbattles/Mythic+/WQs~and so on~ and would like a new pet to play with? Nope gotta find a pug and then debate if you leave right after Zul or not.. thats awesome.</div></div><hr />

Explain to us how you would &quot;train to jump over the bar&quot; that is killing heroic zul in a raid group consisting of solely hunters. Unless by &quot;train&quot; you actually mean &quot;ignore until 18-24 months from now&quot;.<br />

The reward - job correlation is out of touch in this case...First, it is extremely secretive..Who the hell supposed to figure this out and how? Second, compared to reward the requirement is ridiculously hard...but I would like to see your face if you (the whole raid) won`t get loot from bosses unless if you doing them on achievement grade.... simple kill won`t be enough....Work for that loot....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty sure it has been that way for exotic hunter beasts. From rare tames, to elite rep grinds and solo dungeons. It's not supposed to be easy but it gets easier as time goes by. <br />
<br />
Normal mode should be a breeze with next tier, especially when most mechanics are just 'kill and don't stand in stuff.' Vectis and Zul should become easier than the first ones because you spam to kill things and can stand in one place. Just a reminder that fun in an MMO can involve group content. There's nothing wrong with getting help from other hunters and their buddies to grab the tome. It's not elitist or douchey to group up, that's just non-logic.</div></div><hr />

I actually think that Zul with a full raid of hunters would have been pretty fun. You could probably phase him super fast and hunter pets mighy be able to take more stacks in the last phase than most tanks.. hoping someone does it and records the gameplay just for fun. Only really annoying thing would be the crushers, guess they'd have to butn em down or have the pets move em out.</div></div><hr />

Introduce convoluted system. Have it bug out. Realize it's retarded in the first place. Go back to what works.<br />
<br />
Is it too much to ask for Blizz to just do what works from the start?<br />
<br />
As more development is added on top of old development more bugs will happen. Which makes me wonder if alongside with I'll thought out designs is if Bfa is the point where essentially wow from a data point of view is just too bloated.<br />

I wont say this is the most bugged era. Vanilla and BC were full of them. But there has been an upswing the past 2 expansions. Even WoD after the first week DDOS issues were more stable.</div></div><hr />

On topic: If the original intent was for it to be obtained by having a full raid of hunters on heroic Zul, I feel like nerfing it to rolling over normal Zul with a raid of anything is overkill. If the fight's doable on heroic with a raid full of nothing but hunters, surely nerfing it to defeating normal Zul with only hunters (ideally for the class restriction part - you know, the thing that makes it interesting) or killing heroic Zul would've been fine.</div></div><hr />

You only need to kill Zul on N/H/M with a Hunter to get the tome. There's no special raid setup needed.</div></div><hr />

He said in discord that he hearthed out because he messed up his opening/rotation or something like that and didn't want it to affect his logs...<br />

<br />
My issue is them locking something silly like taming a pet behind this specific &quot;wall&quot; when in the past similar things have not been behind it. Others walls sure - which worked just fine when considering not everyone is interested in organized content i.e. raiding. So why start now? Why for a pet? Why Zul? And considering it's not even that special of a pet when the entire zone of Nazmir is full of em' why Crawgs?.<br />
<br />
Questioning things is not crying. I don't even play a hunter :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
So, sorry to break it you, but your argument is still - like it was before; dumb.<br />
<br />
<br />
edit; Being &quot;good&quot; isn't a priority for alot of players &amp; not everyone is interested in having a bar to jump over. People who raid are not the only players out there ;/ What about people who exclusively do PvP/RP/Petbattles/Mythic+/WQs~and so on~ and would like a new pet to play with? Nope gotta find a pug and then debate if you leave right after Zul or not.. thats awesome.<br />
<br />
The reason I talk to you like one is because you behave like one. I am just trying to tell you how things work in a language that you might understand.<br />
<br />
But the whole fun thing about it all is how your agruments are exactly what prove my point plus debunk your own stuff. You say there are a ton of other players out there doing other stuff. Thats fine. But I am not much of pvp player myself, but some of the coolest mounts are behind a boatload of high end pvp. I could claim that in the spirit of fairness blizzard should just hand them to me on a silver platter because getting good at 3v3 or organize RBGs to get that stuff is to much effort!<br />
<br />
Looking at the past and saying &quot;But it never was that way, why do it now&quot; is just faulty in and of itself. Why do anything if it didn't happen in the past? Because that would just stagnate everything and make the game more stale than it already is.<br />
<br />
Why zul? He's the leader of the blood troll faction, surely he has the knowledge to tame the blood beasts. <br />
<br />
And if its not that special of a pet, why is it an issue? But then again, tastes vary and some hunters might really want it and get into things they wern't before. Heck maybe they will start enjoying raiding now.<br />
<br />
Sure, the full hunter raid might be near impossible. But blizzard is trying new things and setting new challenges. People are crying for another mage tower on the forums because they want a challenge to return to the game. Bringing back some prestige to things.<br />
<br />
Them setting up a wall for prestige is not a new thing and it worked in the past aswel.<br />
<br />

<br />
Explain to us how you would &quot;train to jump over the bar&quot; that is killing heroic zul in a raid group consisting of solely hunters. Unless by &quot;train&quot; you actually mean &quot;ignore until 18-24 months from now&quot;.<br />
<br />
Granted, i don't expect a logical post as rebuttal, but oh well.<br />
<br />
Sure, the full hunter raid might be a really high bar. But it doesn't sound impossible if you get likeminded people together. With raider.io being such an easy tool it should be doable to get the right people together.<br />
<br />
As for the fight itself. Pets can tank a lot of damage, with hunter you got a lot of control aswel. CC the hexers as you finish them off one at a time. Focus crushers to prevent it from buffing. Alternate on soaking pools. Things like that. In the final phase I think most hunter pets can take more stacks of the blood than most tanks can. Plus the pets can keep it in the middle while hunters shoot the boss from outside the bloodpool. Alternate sacreficing themselfs on the soaking pools with turtle or something. <br />
<br />
Its would have been real hard. But also glorious if you pulled it off. But since blizz backtracked a bit on it and made it a lot easier to obtain I no longer see an issue at all. Stepping into a raid now isn't really hard now is it? People on here are claiming blizz should just give it to you after the lowered the bar. That was what the discussion was about in the first place. But alright.</div></div><hr />

No they meant for a full raid of hunters to clear heroic zul which is why hearthing worked only if the boss died because after the boss died the game read it as it being only hunters in group</div></div><hr />

The issue is there are so many things that can cause issues from these ideas. For example, the portal enables a skip that people could manipulate for lockouts, the major buff would let Hunter raids clear bosses not intended, and the role select issue causes all the issues people had in WotLK as well as major coordination and learning new things over a short amount of time.<br />

<br />
You think pets can take more stacks than tanks? You're not serious are you? Following some mechanics doesn't magically negate other unavoidable mechanics like you're implying. Neither does having a high r.io score (really not sure what being able to dps in a m+ as to do with executing mechanics not meant for your role in a heroic raid). There is almost zero chance your pet is going to live through the third stack in heroic unless over half of the hunters in the group pops spirit mend on them. Then as soon as the HoT falls off, dead pet and blood pool. Then guess what, zul is going to agro onto various hunters because you can't taunt raid bosses with pets. And which hunters are you going to have dispel deathwish off of players?<br />
<br />
What would have been required of the group to complete the fight in the way the developers intended to get the tome was logistically impossible, raider.io or otherwise. The discussion was about a hotfix, then you started complaining that they &quot;lowered the bar&quot; from something logistically impossible. &quot;But alright.&quot;</div></div><hr />
