The prereq level for Death Knight probably won't be 80 to avoid any leveling rush just to unlock it. It could possibly be between 55 and 60. Once you reached the required level you create your Death Knight and face some challenges. If you have mastered them, you will get your Death Knight.<br />
Runes combination will unlock different abilities for the Death Knight. You can use up to 6 runes and there isn't any restriction (6 unholy, 2 unholy 2 frost 2 blood, 3 frost 3 blood, etc ...). For example you will need blood and unholy runes to use &quot;Army of the Dead&quot;, and won't be able to use it if you've only got frost runes.<br />
Future hero classes could be Demon Hunter, Arch Mage, and Blademaster. <br />

<br />
buffed.de (http://www.buffed.de) is talking with Jeff Kaplan, Lead Designer World of Warcraft (Blizzard Entertainment)<br />
<br />
On the first day of the Leipzig Games Convention 2007, the buffed.de team had the opportunity to talk about World of Warcraft's second expansion with Blizzard's Lead Designer. In this exciting interview Jeff gives away some details about the upcoming instance &quot;The Caverns of Time: Stratholme&quot;, in which you, together with an old acquaintance, fight against the Scourge - and more.<br />
<br />
Jeff: Your magazine cover looks really cool.<br />
buffed: You have seen it already? We are very proud of it.<br />
Jeff: Well, you can be!<br />
<br />
buffed: Did you have the opportunity to read out magazine already?<br />
Jeff: Unfortunately no. Someone was walking around with the magazine and I only read &quot;buffed&quot;, saw the cover and thought &quot;Sweet&quot;!<br />
<br />
buffed: We have a pretty comprehensive section about BlizzCon in our magazine.<br />
Jeff: Yes, you also have a picture of Sammy (Sam Didier, Senior Creative Director, Blizzard Entertainment). Have you seen Sammy already? He is around here somewhere. He is the front man of the Level 70 Elite Tauren Chieftains.<br />
<br />
buffed: Ah, you mean the picture in which he is on stage, with Mike Morhaime playing the bass right next to him. A cool photo.<br />
Jeff: Yeah, a really good photo!<br />
<br />
buffed: Now, to the topic: We heard a lot of things about Wrath of the Lich King at BlizzCon. Have there been any news since?<br />
Jeff: There are a few things that we did not talk about at BlizzCon. The most important thing is the new Caverns of Time instance Stratholme. We wanted to return to the Caverns of Time concept because it is one of the coolest things we released for World of Warcraft: and we wanted to persue what the Bronze Dragon is up to. We want to show you some of the coolest moments of Warcraft. And now we chose Stratholme. Players of World of Warcraft already know Stratholme and many hardcore players are great fans of the old Stratholme instance. Warcraft 3 players however know Stratholme from a single player mission, in which Arthas travels to the city and sets all buildings on fire, kills the citizens and fights Mal'Ganis. In Wrath of the Lich King you fight at Prince Arthas' side, by travelling through the Caverns of Time. We are giving you the opportunity of meeting Arthas at a time at which he was not a great villain yet. You are &quot;cleaning&quot; Stratholme and igniting buildings!<br />
<br />
buffed: Awesome! For how many players is this instance designed?<br />
Jeff: It will be a five player instance, but for level 80 characters. We think that players will not enter the Caverns of Time while they are levelling, but return to them at level 80.<br />
<br />
buffed: Have you already decided which race the Death Knight will be based on? If one plays a Gnome, will the Death Knight be a Gnome too?<br />
Jeff: Yes, we have already made a decision. But do not be surprised if we decide to change our minds. You know, game design is a very flexible job. Right now, every race can become a Death Knight, even Gnomes. We have thought about some things since BlizzCon. Characters most likely will not have to be level 80 to unlock the Death Knight, it will probably be earlier. Levelling to level 80 like a maniac to unlock the Death Knight is simply not fun. It makes people rush through the game. That is why we will make it differently. We have many ideas, but we have not decided on one yet. Maybe the Death Knight will be unlocked between level 55 and 60. Then you create your Death Knight and face some challenges. If you have mastered them, you will get your Death Knight.<br />
<br />
buffed: But the newly created level 55 to 60 character will not become a Death Knight, or will it?<br />
Jeff: No, the old character stays. You just get an additional one. You know, many players give their characters names related to their class. There are many names specific to Druids...<br />
<br />
buffed: You mean names like &quot;ilove2spooch&quot; in the World of Warcraft Southpark episode?<br />
Jeff: (laughs) Yes, exactly. There are many names like that. And many just would not fit and that is why we are giving the players the chance to give their Death Knights a new, suitable name.<br />
<br />
buffed: Can you give us some details about the Death Knight's abilities?<br />
Jeff: Sure. The resourcing system is completely different and based on runes. At Blizzard we are concentrating on making the characters differ from each other as much as possible. The best example are Rogue and Warrior. The Rogue uses combo points and the Warrior uses rage - quite a difference. When we started developing the Death Knight, we wanted it to feel distinct. That is why we gave him runes, which can be ingraved to his weapon, an axe or sword. There are three different types of runes: blood, unholy and frost. Depending on how you combine them, you get different abilities. The maximum you can have is six, and you can combine them in any way you want. For example: you could use two of each type of rune, or you could use four unholy runes and two blood runes, because you want to tank with your Death Knight. Or you could change your rune configuration for PvP battles. If you use your abilities, you consume those runes, however. We have one skill called &quot;Army of the Dead&quot;, which summons Ghouls. Right now you need unholy and blood runes for that ability, I believe. If you only had frost runes ingraved on your weapon, you could not use that ability. We have developed a pretty cool system that makes the runes on your weapon glow if you change the combination.<br />
<br />
buffed: Last question: the Death Knight is only the first of many hero classes. Which hero class would you like to introduce next?<br />
Jeff: My favorite? That is hard to say. I think the Demon Hunter would be extremely cool. The Arch Mage would be cool too...<br />
buffed: (whispers) Blade Master!<br />
Jeff: (laughs) There are many options, among them, of course, the fantastic Blade Master. We did a lot of brain storming and also thought about classes that were not present in Warcraft 3. But we wanted to advance slowly and introduce the Death Knight first in Wrath of the Lich King. And then we will see what is next.</div></div><hr />

Oh well, it was a good training &gt;_&lt;<br />
<br />
EDIT: I'll post my translation anyway! Nyaha!<br />
<br />
buffed: We already heard a lot of things about Wrath of the Lich King at BlizzCon. Any news since then?<br />
Jeff: There are a couple of things we haven't talked about at BlizzCon, such as the new &quot;Caverns of Time&quot;-Instance Stratholme. We wanted to get back to the CoT-concept as it was one of the coolest things added to WoW recently. We also want to pursue what the Bronce Dragonflight is up to. We seek to show you the greatest moments of Warcraft history, and now we picked Stratholme. Many hardcore WoW players are fans of the old Stratholme-instance, while Warcraft 3 players know Stratholme from the single player mission, in which the player controls Arthas, burning buildings, killing the residents and fighting the Dreadlord Mal'Ganis. In WotLK you will have the opportunity to battle alongside Arthas before he turned into what he is now. You will &quot;cleanse&quot; Stratholme und burn it down!<br />
<br />
[...]<br />
<br />
Jeff: Stratholme is going to be designed for a group of 5 level 80 characters. We don't want players to visit CoT - Stratholme during leveling, but to return when they hit 80.<br />
<br />
buffed: A question regarding the new hero class, the Death Knight: players will encounter Arthas during levelling more than once, for example in the Caverns of Time. Where else?<br />
Jeff: CoT - Stratholme will not be part of unlocking the DK. The Death Knight is going to be a complete new gaming experience. They start with a level much higher than regular characters, supposedly level 55-60. This has yet to be determined. We are going to explain exactly how your Death Knight will be able to elude the influence of the Lich King, this development will be completely independent from the new Caverns of Time.<br />
<br />
buffed: Did you already decide which race the playable Death Knight is going to be once a player unlocks it? For example, if your original character is a gnome, will the DK be one, too?<br />
Jeff: Yes, we already have decided on that. But don't be surprised if we change our mind. You know, game designing is a very flexible matter. At the moment, any class can be a Death Knight, including gnomes. We reconsidered a couple of things since BlizzCon. Players probably don't have to be level 80 to unlock the Death Knight, the class will be accessible earlier. Powerleveling to level 80 in order to get to play the Death Knight as soon as possible is no fun and makes people rush through the game. We do have a lot of ideas regarding this topic. We haven't decided yet, but maybe the DK will be unlockable between level 55 and 60. Players can then create their Death Knights and have to go through a trial in order to be able to play their DKs.<br />
<br />
[...]<br />
<br />
buffed: The original character will not become a Death Knight. Many characters are named according to their class<br />
<br />
[...]<br />
<br />
buffed: Can you give us a bit of detail of the Death Knight's abilities?<br />
Jeff: Of course. The Death Knight's resource is based on runes. We at Blizzard concentrate our efforts on making every single class as unique as possible. Best examples for this are the Rogue- and Warrior-classes. The Rogue uses energy and combo points while the Warrior generates rage - two things that differ greatly. When we designed the Death Knight we wanted it to be considerably different from the other classes. The DK will be able to carve runes into his weapon, which can either be a sword or an axe. There will be three different kind of runes: Unholy, Blood and Frost. Different combinations of a total of 6 runes yield different results. You can combine 2 of every rune type or, for example 4 Unholy and 2 Blood type runes. By using his abilities the Death Knight uses up the runes. For example, the Death Knight has a skill called &quot;Army of the Dead&quot;, which summons Ghouls. This skill requires Blood and Unholy rune types. Thus, you would not be able to use this ability with only Frost runes carved into your weapon. We also designed a pretty cool system that makes the runes on your weapon flash up when changing your combination of runes.<br />
<br />
buffed: The final question: The Death Knight is but the first of the new hero classes. Which other heroes would you like to see introduced to the game?<br />
Jeff: My favorite? That's gard to say, I guess the Demon Hunter would be pretty cool, as would the Archmage be...<br />
buffed: (whispering) Blademaster!<br />
Jeff: (laughs) There's plenty of options, the fantastic Blademaster being one of them. We did a lot of brainstorming and also thought about classes that weren't present in Warcraft 3. However, we will go step by step and first of all introduce the Death Knight with Wrath of the Lich King. Then we'll see what's up next.</div></div><hr />

Must disagree with you....<br />
or is it that you are scared from a gnome/ tauren death knight :P<br />
seriously now<br />
Tel me somethign why should you have the chance as a human/Orc to unlock death knight and not many other players who play as you play this game?<br />

<br />
As for all races being deathknights, I don't see why not... granted a gnome deathknight will lok as scary as a pink bunny on Easter, but w/e... still sounds cool to play it, and I'm glad we get to try their metel before lvl 80 too (deathknight vs deathknight world pvp in WPL all around ^^)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Think of it this way:<br />
<br />
A death knight is supposed to be a hero enveloped by evil (like in the blizzcon video). It could have been any character race walking through the woods and getting jumped by a bunch of mobs of undead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True.<br />
What's all the QQ about? I don't care if I get attacked by a gnome death knight as long as he's got some huge aura around me so I can see him coming...<br />
Death Knight means - you die, you get rezed as undead, you kill. Doesn't really say anything about 'you shapeshift into a beatiful orc...'</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulika</div><div class="date">2007-08-23, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All races should be able ot unlock it, but when made it should be only human, Dwarf, Orc, or Undead..<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
And what is the basis for this list? Nothing more than personal preference.<br />
<br />
If you wanted to argue that only races who can be Paladins can become Death Knights it might make some sense to have only Human, Dwarf, Draenai and Blood Elf Death Knights but a random list plucked out of your arse makes no more sense than just allowing everyone to be a Death Knight. How can Orc or Undead become a fallen Paladin anymore than a Gnome can?<br />
<br />
If on the other hand you look at Death Knight as something that comes from the power of Lich channelled through a living host there is no reason not to prevent anyone from becoming one. So other than totally unfounded personal bias have you any reason why Orcs should but Gnomes shouldn't become Death Knights?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do, I do!n Orcs were the first Death Knights.... (man that was easy...)<br />
Humans were the second I guess... It would make sens for undead to be DK's too (they're ex-humans who fell for the most part, or elves, who can be Deathknights too since they're pallies). Seems to me like a tauren or a drainei(friends of the naruu being a DK? gimme a break) GK wouldn't make anymore sense than a gnome one (I can't really picture a troll DK either for some reason....). Dwarves should not be pallies because Arthas was the cause of their king's brother's death, imo.<br />
So yea, I would say all races should be able to unlock it (and they will), but I would also agree that only some races should be able to be DK's...<br />
That way, it will make sense why you won't be able to have a Tauren archmage or a human keeper of the groove...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pyrostemplar</div><div class="date">2007-08-23, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I certainly see the point of not allowing every race to become DK (some combos are a bit on the weird side), the thought of a Pinky haired female gnome as a DK is just too good to pass over it.<br />
<br />
So, in the end, if needed I'd allow only gnomes to become DK (ok and - another take your pick - horde race just for &quot;balancing reasons&quot;) :P<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the image of a Tauren Archmage sounds pretty strange to me... although I thoroughly like those cows...</div></div><hr />

As for tauren archmages: never!, but that's granted (I hope), I would even go further by saying that archmages should only be alliance, and blood mages horde (or lich? I know you guys like that idea, c'mon!!!)</div></div><hr />

Night Elves: Anti-any magic (outside druidism), nonetheless death magic.. Hate to see the world defiled and nature disturbed.. the exact opposite of a Death Knight<br />
Gnomes: Definitly not strong enough to handle being a warrior nonetheless a death knight..<br />
Trolls: Not Death Knight material, uses voodoo magic but really doesn't fit the theme for a death knight..<br />
Tauren: Hate to see the world defiled and nature disturbed.. the exact opposite of a Death Knight<br />
Blood Elves: Would be fine, but Alliance would whine for a 3rd race to be deathknights<br />
Draenei: Don't even.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nobody cares if joe blow the greedy dirt bag gives up his life to become a Death Knight, but you do care when the Hero - a paladin turns to the dark side. And that is the greatest accomlishment of the dark side - To convert somebody who is the protector of light, his loss (change) hits hard on the moral on the masses - the common people.<br />
<br />
Thats why most people percieve Death Knights to be fallen Paladins, because those are the stories we like to focus on. <br />
<br />
Death Knights are those who have been given up thier will, and have been given the control to raise the dead. Anybody can fall to the dark side. <br />
<br />
Any Race <br />
<br />
Even the noble Tauren - who love nature and will do anything to defend it, can become blind enough to the fact. To him, being a Death Knight will be a self sacrifice to protect nature. To this Tauren, he will use his powers of the dead to protect what remains of Nature.</div></div><hr />

Here's a good timeline for you guys:<br />
Eredar - good race<br />
Naaru comes - builds big mana-floating ships for the Draenei.<br />
Sargeras comes - eredars seperate in Eredar (under Sargeras' rule) and Draenei (aka the Exiled Ones under the Naaru's blessing)<br />
Naaru helps - Draenei escape with a wing from the Tempest Keep called The Exodar (the living quarters) and crash land (bad engineers i guess) on Azeroth.<br />

(note: I am of course not saying not everyone should be able to unlock DK's, but simply that lore-wise it would make little sense to have DK's of every race, other races will have their own hero classes in the future, no worries)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cairo</div><div class="date">2007-08-26, 02:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm just very afraid about this whole Hero class thing. I've been playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons for a few years with some friends now, and if you get a hero class there, or a specialization in a class say for example: a warrior that becomes a paladins through training and respect, that is how a heroclass should work, not the other way around by unlocking it.<br />
<br />
If you'd ask me for suggestions i'd like to propose an idea like this :<br />
The Warrior Class<br />
Protection - Play a heroclass devoted to the protection tree (Supertank)<br />
Fury - Play a heroclass devoted to dealing alot of quick damage (Rogue-like damagedealer, i know it sounds corny)<br />
Arms - Play a heroclass that is both tough, and can tank a little, and eal great amounts of damage, but slower. (The Diablo 2 equivalent to a Barbarian)<br />
<br />
If you'd make those options available, i think that way it would be more balanced in the end.<br />
Ofcourse i haven't seen Wotlk yet, and i know it's still in it's early stages, but yea i see some major changes in gameplay coming up. Everybody will try to unlock that character and play a deathknight, or another heroclass.<br />
<br />
What if i don't want to?<br />
I've got my warrior that i've been playing since the start of WoW, i don't want to do anything else..<br />
I love to tank in instances, make progress.<br />
<br />
I don't want to unlock a new character to play as a main, but it will probably happen.<br />
Will my current warrior be completely useless? because heroclasses - The name says it all.<br />
Are there to be better than our current classes and are more viable and powerful in raids.<br />
<br />
I really fear this as the end of WoW as we know it, ofcourse blizz will come up with something new to fix that already..<br />
But i don't want to make a new character to play to advance in WoW: Wrath of the Lich King.<br />
and this is probably Blizzard's aim to her customers.<br />
The game is being made too easy, for the &quot;casual&quot; gamer.<br />
Well, make content for those, and make content for the hardcore gamer.<br />
You can't be a pro in your class and have the best items around if you play casually anyway, why make the rest of us suffer from it. E.g. = 30% increase in Experience by quests, and a bit less experience required.<br />
I think it's just fine as it is, i still think we level up too fast.<br />
TBC took me 5 days to get to level 70. (Yes, i took a vacation and played nearly day and night) but still i got there too fast.<br />
Why touch a running system?<br />
<br />
The people that are complaining, are the majority of underaged children that can't find the time to do it all at the same time.<br />
Mostly the Counter-Strike youth or MTv Generation as i'd like to call them.<br />
<br />
To get back on topic: <br />
I just want to keep playing my warrior as it is now, but with the abilities of becoming a Hero class. or the option to quest to be a heroclass atleast.<br />
<br />
I hope some blizzard representative will read these forums, and takes these thoughts in mind.<br />
For me it'd be reason enough to quit and not play Wotlk, even though i'm a loyal player and great fan.<br />

You know what.. when Horde was given Blood Elves and Paladins you know what happen, for the first 2-3 weeks, 80% of the new Blood Elves where paladins. When I checked out the other side, 80% of the 1-10 dreneni were Shaman. After that, only those who really wanted to play paladins/shaman stuck with it.<br />
<br />
So what if the same thing happens with DK's. For the first few weeks - everybody is going to try it out... Some people will really enjoy it and make it thier new main, some people will play them as alts when there is nothing else to do (or the grind is getting to them), but most people will realize they have too much time invested in thier previous toon and will go back. In a month or two, everything will balance back out to normal. <br />
<br />
This will happen every single time a new class/race comes out.<br />
<br />
Nothing will get ruined - WoW will continue to be a great game, other then what you feel has already been ruined for &quot;reason X, Y and Z&quot;</div></div><hr />

After seeing that they are only going to release like one Hero class per expansion, I'm not that worried. It just seems they are another alternative to our classes. It was always my belief that Hero classes would be a step up for us and seeing a melee dps in plate coming in was making me wonder how useful a class like rogue would be. Using that logic and applying to all classes (thinking there would be more Heroes on the way soon), I just figured we'd all have a new class better than us.

Actually I quit the game - at least for the time being. Still think it is a great game, but not really worthwhile to stay on it for me atm. Some factors prompted me to switch to LOTRO (fine game btw, and a way better and richer environment), although none of them were PVP related ;).<br />
But true, I've never done a &quot;I'm going to quit the game because...&quot; kind of post ::)<br />

<br />
&quot;Hero&quot; classes are a Catch22... If they are more powerful than &quot;ordinary&quot; classes, you get the &quot;Jedi&quot; effect + extra whine. IF they are just as powerful as regular classes, people get disappointed.<br />
<br />
Now, hero class as an evolution of you current char, or as a completely new char? To have them as an evolution, it would mean that every &quot;regular&quot; class would have to have at least one Hero class that they could evolve into. And Blizzard either wouldn't have the resources (time-wise) or wouldn't want to waste them in order to make that true to a single expansion.<br />
It seems to me they chose the easier, less risky and more profitable path. Most likely a sound decision. Lets just hope they don't screw up as much as they did in TBC...</div></div><hr />

Well, it would depend a lot on the execution. In the limit it can be argued that balancing 18 hero classes (taking the 2 per current class as base) isn't all that different than balancing 9 classes with 3 trees each. Also of point is that the path to the hero could not be necessarily singular. Taking as an example the DeathKnight and a &quot;char evolution&quot;, Blizzard could make it with only one tree and make it common to Palas and warriors. A &quot;Keeper of the grove class&quot; could be accessed by Shammies and druids. As an example, you could have 18 classes (or whatever) with 9 exclusives and 9 shared among more than one original class&quot;.<br />
<br />
But would it be a good idea? I sincerely doubt so. Changing the class mechanics extensively is not such a good choice, particularly when the final result might not be such a great thing.<br />
<br />
But my main point is that &quot;Hero classes&quot; sound far better than they actually are in a MMORPG.<br />
<br />
P.S. - I &quot;only&quot; put one per class - a number that I also consider low for that kind of hero class concept - just illustrate that the amount of work and balance needed would be - even in a &quot;minimum&quot; execution - quite high.</div></div><hr />

As much as I aggree with the bit about 2 hero(or even 3, but that's pushing it) classes per normal class (or else it's the same thing under a different name), i can't entirely agree with you. I don't think it would be all that hard to balance as the classes would differ the same way talents do. Now, granted, some talents are better than others, but that always depends on the situation really...</div></div><hr />

I don't really quite care about the race...but the place where the DK stays...<br />
From the post below seems that they are not welcomed everywhere ;)<br />
A new city for the DK? Will all the NPCs are ghouls? :o (imagine)<br />
Or there will be a new reputation bar for DK that separate from both the Horde and the Alliance? :o<br />
And a group of DKs and dead army on the battlegroudn will be awesome ;)<br />
Let's wait and see!</div></div><hr />

Please don't say it, don't say that u think there's going to be only ONE talant tree per hero class. That's breaking the game the easy way. A healer (priest/shaman/paladin/druid) hero class evolution would be death for players who chose it. We're talking hero classes with 3 talent trees.</div></div><hr />

Don't worry - not only DK won't have a single talent tree as they won't be an &quot;evolution&quot; class and there wont be 18 new classes in the expansion. We (I) was discussing alternate paths that Blizz could have followed - but didn't (which, without further considerations, was a good thing).<br />
<br />
And also there are no &quot;true&quot; hero classes. Just aditional classe(s) that you can unlock (a bit like midtown madness and many other games). Don't like it? tough luck :D</div></div><hr />
