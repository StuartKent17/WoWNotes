We recently added account-level changes to achievements in World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria, and there’s still a lot of work left before we’re done. The plan here is to illustrate the intent behind our design, which should in turn help you figure out the answers to many of your questions.<br />
<br />
Overall, we never want you to play Character A instead of Character B because of achievement concerns. If Character A had the Violet Proto-Drake, then you might not play Character B. If Character A was only one holiday away from the Violet Proto-Drake, then you may not play Character B. If Character A had completed most of the raid achievements from Dragon Soul, you may not want to bring Character B for one fight and miss out on the achievement. Having alts is cool and working on achievements is cool, but we don’t want the two systems to work against each other.<br />
<br />
This goal is paramount and drives everything else. If we allowed you to earn extra achievement points from completing an achievement on two different characters, then you might only want to play the character with the most points and you’d feel like you had to grind through all the achievements with every alt, thus defeating the purpose of having account-level achievements.<br />
<br />
Most achievements are account-wide<br />
<br />
This means you only earn the points once. If you have earned an achievement on one character, you can see it on all your characters. However, and this is important, you will still see the achievement toast (the pop-up notification) if a second or subsequent character completes the achievement. We think it’s still important to recognize milestones like reaching level 80, maxing out a profession, or killing a raid boss for the first time. It's fun to have everyone congratulate you when you get the toast. Nonetheless, this will just be a new character of yours completing the achievement that you’ve already earned on your account. You won’t double up on points.<br />
<br />
Most criteria are not account-wide<br />
<br />
If you start an achievement on one character, you can't then finish the achievement on another (there are exceptions, so please keep reading). We didn't think it made sense for one character to get level 60 and another to get level 20 and then see the &quot;level 80&quot; achievement toast. If you start to explore Thousand Needles on one character, you’ll probably want to finish that achievement on the same character.<br />
<br />
Some achievements are &quot;meta achievements.&quot;<br />
<br />
These are achievements that require you to get other specific achievements. An infamous example is &quot;What a Long, Strange Trip It's Been.&quot; These achievements generally ARE account-wide. If one character earned Noble Gardener and another character earned The Flame Warden, then your account would get Long Strange Trip. (Otherwise it would be weird: it would look as if you had the sub-achievements, but you wouldn't have the meta-achievement). Even though you need Explore Thousand Needles on one character, all of your characters can contribute to Explore Kalimdor.<br />
<br />
A very few achievements are account-only.<br />
<br />
There are two categories of account-only achievements. One is achievements that are not possible to earn on one character. If we made an achievement to level every class to level 90, it would be account-only. (I'm not sure we will, but it's a good example.) The other category are achievements that are just brutal to complete on one character (and you’d never want to do for multiples), such as 2500 daily quests or 250K honorable kills. In these cases, the cumulative work of all your characters on those criteria will count.<br />
<br />
We hope that rewards granted from achievements (pets, mounts, titles, and tabards) will be shared at the account level.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to promise this yet, because a lot of magic has to happen for that to work, but it's our intent. We have discussed having a character level requirement for some rewards, so that your level-2 gnome couldn’t walk around with the “Defender of a Shattered World” title just because your level-90 shaman earned it. If the gnome made it to level 80, though, you could proudly show off your title. You also won’t be able to use a faction-specific pet, mount, or title on the wrong faction. The achievement wouldn’t go away -- you just wouldn’t be able to show it off on that character. There are probably additional exceptions and details we’ll find as we dig deeper into the system.<br />
<br />
This is the kind of system that will evolve over time, and we don’t think this has to be the way achievements work forever. As beta players start experimenting with it and offering feedback, I am certain that we will end up making even more changes.<br />

<br />
Still not a big fan of the change as it literally kills the ''unique'' feel of every alts but meh. Also from a PvP, do i have any reason to play competitively my alts and try to go for Grand Marshal for example on my rogue, if all my alts already get the title from my Hunter? Also, lets say i get Gladiator as a Hunter or Rogue, it doesn't mean i can actually reach such rating as a Resto Shaman or Mage for example. Even from the PvE side, its not because i killed H:Madness as a Hunter that i could effectively heal the fight on a Resto Druid for example. <br />
<br />
Grinding achievements is also fun for some people, i have Battlemaster on 2 characters, i find it extremely fun to go for those goals when i bg, instead of just killing people for the sake of it, it means i'm not allowed to go for Battlemaster on say, my rogue anymore?<br />
<br />
Idk, feels it removes more options and create more problems than it solve.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All achievements will still be &quot;per-character&quot; that is the point of the post. Each character can still earn the achievements, you are just able to see the achievements completed on your account and the highest number of points earned. It even points out what characters have actually earned the achievement for you.</div></div><hr />

Im sorry but If i spend 2 years grinding out Battlemaster and mounts/ titles ect... heck ya I wanna show it on whatever character i play., bc no my mage didnt earn it I DID!. <br />
And if for some reason my guild no longer needs my mage and they need a healer... I roll a healer, then yes i should have the same achievements show on my healer bc i as a player earned them. <br />

Yes, meta-achievements are achievements that are made up of other achievements. In your example, yes -- Loremaster of Cata on one character and the rest on the others, will get you the Loremaster achieve.</div></div><hr />

They will most likely add a class restriction to the mount itself. Just like engineering mounts right now require a certain skill level to ride it, even though it shows up on all your toons in the mount book.</div></div><hr />

It only made basic sense to me that these changes would be implemented from the start. It's nice to have the clarification though for people who weren't sure.<br />
<br />
My main was fun to learn to play at first and I stuck with it. The more I played, the more achievements and pets/mounts I earned the more I felt chained to that one character. I still enjoyed playing others, but I always fell back on my overachiever. This will make a lot of altoholics lives so much easier. This is a godsend and should have been implemented when achievements first were in the very least.</div></div><hr />

The good thing is, this will puzzle together my loremaster achievement currently scattered on like 7 twinks and my main.<br />

The other category are achievements that are just brutal to complete on one character (and you’d never want to do for multiples), such as 2500 daily quests or 250K honorable kills. In these cases, the cumulative work of all your characters on those criteria will count.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;If you have earned an achievement on one character, you can see it on all your characters. However, and this is important, you will still see the achievement toast (the pop-up notification) if a second or subsequent character completes the achievement&quot; - That means you can still track if that character has completed a given raid or something. This was one of the biggest complaints from people, that they would not be able to use achievements in order to invite someone for a raid. Nothing to complain anymore!<br />
<br />
&quot;The other category are achievements that are just brutal to complete on one character (and you’d never want to do for multiples), such as 2500 daily quests or 250K honorable kills&quot; - That means I can PVP on all my characters and all the HKs will count towards 100k and 250k! Now I am very inclined to level a toon for PVP-only purposes!<br />

Sorry for still not understanding. But lets say I wanna go for &quot;The Loremaster&quot;<br />
Can I be &quot;Loremaster of Cataclysm&quot; on my mage and then &quot;Loremaster of..(the rest)&quot; and still get the achievement &quot;&quot;The Loremaster&quot;?<br />
Cuz when he explains the &quot;meta achievements.&quot; it does sound like thats possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you have Loremaster of Cata on one toon. Loremaster of Northend on another. Loremaster of BC on a third. Loremaster of EK on a fourth and Loremaster of Kal on a 5th, you'll still get &quot;The Loremaster&quot;</div></div><hr />

I managed to complete 50k on my main in my first 2 years of playing him. In the 2 years since I've only earned an additional 10k or so, mostly due to not enjoying pvp on my warlock in Cata. Yet I've been loving pvp on my other classes and have gained another 40k+ across them and this will put me well over the 100k HK needed for the achievement / title I've been coveting for years.<br />

Some such as raid or pvp achievements which are hugely influenced in viability by the choice of class and spec I feel needs some discussion.<br />

They have not (yet) clarified whether these are limited to Account-wide or Battle.net --or at the very least, they need to specify; of which I expect they will release when they have the specifics nailed down themselves and absorbed the community's reactions -etc.<br />

Yes this is the case.<br />
But, let's say you have 40 quests done in Shadowmoon Valley on one char, and 50 on another, this does not add up to 90 quests done - you'll need to complete it on one char for it to count towards the meta.</div></div><hr />

As it stands right now it would appear that meta-achievements will be a cumulative effort from all the characters on your account, so each toon can complete an achievement. <br />
<br />
Individual achievements with multiple criteria will still need to be completed under the character that it was started under.</div></div><hr />

I fail to see your point. You say you worked hard for that title but so did all the other &quot;noobs&quot; as you say, aslo worked hard for that acheviement. So, I do not see why they should not be able to run around with that title, as they have already earned it.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, I have 1 main and 4 alts now with 2 of my alts not quite 85 yet. For whatever reason once I hit Outland I try to do the explore and quest achievement for each zone. It's nice to know I no longer have to do that.<br />
<br />
Secondly, my main is a raiding guild who I haven't played in over a year. I've had a tough time deciding what to do with him since he had all my achievements but with this change it makes my whole life easier.</div></div><hr />

I believe blizzard should disallow this. It makes no more sense for a warlock on a pally mount than it does for an Orc on a human mount. I have faith in blizzard though :) I'd be surprised to see this make it to release.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One concern I have is quests. For instance is you do 50 quests on one toon and 60 on another, 50 of which were done by the other toon, you should get credit for only doing 60 quests not 110. So I guess the system would have to be the computer has a giant list of quests in game and when you complete it on any toon it marks off that quest and counts one and is unable to ever count that quest again no matter how many alts do it.<br />
<br />
The other one isn't really a concern but an acknowledgement. People with 10 alts can do 250 dailies a day making it far easier to grind out those dailies quickly but hey if thats what you want to do I'm not going to stop you and I don't want it to stop this change.<br />

Yes that is currently how it works in beta. Between three toons I had 99 mounts so I grabbed a mammoth and now all toons received the 100 mount reward in the mail.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I.e. it's not going to be right when it goes live, and we don't care, because we can always fix it later.<br />
<br />
It's this type of philosophy that really bugs me. It's why they're completely redoing talents AGAIN. They didn't get it right, so they'll try something else. If it doesn't work, what does it matter? Who cares if everyone spent time and effort to learn the new system? Who cares if they got rid of the old system that people liked? And if people aren't doing what the designers wanted them to do (e.g. going down to the end of the talent tree to pick up the final talent), they'll just force them to do it.<br />
<br />
It's a lack of concern over the quality of the current implementation, and it didn't exist until MMOs came around. It shouldn't exist at all.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hx9</div><div class="date">2012-05-08, 05:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately, account wide achievements, pets and mounts do create a pretty significant farming problem. I relate it to the 10 mans being &quot;optional&quot; to 25 man guilds back in Wrath of the Lich King. Seeing as these account wide things do not effect character power (or do they? read on) I don't see it as a significant problem just yet! Let's look at this in depth.<br />
<br />
Imagine the Darkmoon Faire dailies from a min-maxing perspective. I do the daily quests and profession quests on 8 different characters. 6 of those characters buy the available, non-combat pets, 2 of them buy the mounts. If I want to get these things at the quickest pace, I am forced to play different characters. This may be required for competitive pet battling. DMF isn't the only place this exists. This goes against the philosophy of 'play the character you want to play.'<br />
- Darkmoon Faire<br />
- Orphan Holiday x 3 (Shat, Dal &amp; Home City)<br />
- Argent Tournament<br />
- Any Daily Hub in general because of the daily cap (25 / day)<br />
- Old Man Barlow Fishing Daily (Crocklisk in the city)<br />
- Really, any daily quest that has a 'chance' at a non-combat pet reward<br />
<br />
What about rare mounts? I can solo exclusive raid / dungeon lockouts up to 50 times / day (or week for raids).<br />
- Anzu<br />
- White Hawkstrider<br />
- Firey Warhorse<br />
- Kael'Thas, although this was already able to be done because it's BoE<br />
- Alysrazor (Soloed by shadow priest and boomkin)<br />
- Any daily quest which has a 'chance' at a mount reward<br />
<br />
Certain Meta-Achievements could be artificially made easier as well in this system, greatly benefiting characters with ALTs.<br />
- Glory to the Raider style achievements could be done on an ALT while the heroics are completed on a main<br />
- Achievements in heroic dungeons could be attempted multiple times in the case of failure without relying on RNG of the dungeon finder to take you there. I'm looking at you, speed run of Deadmines Dream! Jump that electricity!<br />
- If a certain faction has a quest chain or other achievement that's easier like Loremaster in some zones.<br />
<br />
For avid collectors of pets, mounts and achievements, ALTs are no longer 'optional', they are a requirement. In essence, it gives them a competitive edge that a solo-character player does not have. Some assumed retorts to this are as follows.<br />
<br />
1) The time commitment is still the same - This is very true, and probably what makes most of the above statements okay. The DMF dailies I did 6 times, 3 months in a row and, as a result, I now have all 6 pets. I was lazy and only got the turn ins on one character who has one of the mounts. Still, this doesn't solve the problem of earning the rewards too quickly, which means that I will probably not be doing the DMF any more until there are new rewards. It also doesn't change the fact that I had to do these on characters I didn't want to play, especially ones who don't have epic mounts yet! Argent Tournament dailies (again, these had BOE pets, and I did farm these on one character to give to my main) would be an even bigger burden if I didn't want to play certain characters, but wanted to earn the pets and mounts at a faster rate.<br />
<br />
2) Character power isn't effected, so although you can farm more, it doesn't make you overpowered! - This is still up in the air to me. In pet battles, for one, your power is effected. A variety of pets means a variety of options when fighting opponents. What's interesting is that reputations will not be cross-character just yet, but the head enchants are already BoA. This very slight effect on power is a great quality of life option that effects character power in a positive way. So aside from pet battles which don't have a ladder and are just a mini-game... for now, what character benefits could you get?<br />
- Certain mounts are power benefits, including the new mount that can walk on water, mounts which can swap between land / ground water mounts and passenger mounts<br />
- When leveling a new character in Vash'ir, a second character will have a sea horse right away! <br />
- The economy will take a hit. You only need to get that expensive mount on one character now, so overall character wealth will go up.<br />
<br />
3) The good outweighs the bad! - It's a slippery slope to a power benefit being available by having ALTs. Already, characters can farm valor points on their ALTs and pass off BoE items to their mains, though this will be &quot;fixed&quot; when valor points provide only character upgrades. We have to be careful what we wish for with account wide character rewards. Even if they aren't power related, burn out is a possibility which lowers the number of players in the player base. Carrots on a stick good, but chase too many carrots and your neck starts hurting!<br />
<br />
Fact is, we have to tread lightly as more of these options are added to a game where they weren't in the original design. The moment there's a weekly, sustainable reason to play ALTs for power is the moment things have gone too far (see frost badges and http://www.wowhead.com/item=49908/primordial-saronite). The old days where power was related to game time spent is the most important fallacy of MMOs gone by. The last thing we need is for anyone to even have the option of farming so much, they burn out!</div></div><hr />

Those mounts already work that way. I got my blue dragonhawk back in wrath by intentionally leveling professions up to the requisite skill needed to craft the mounts, making them, learning them, then unlearning the professions. You still possess the mount, but can't use it unless you have requisite skill.</div></div><hr />

My main was fun to learn to play at first and I stuck with it. The more I played, the more achievements and pets/mounts I earned the more I felt chained to that one character. I still enjoyed playing others, but I always fell back on my overachiever. This will make a lot of altoholics lives so much easier.

They said at Blizzcon that the achievements are going to be global across your battle.net account. I assume that hasn't changed as I haven't heard differently yet. It is impossible to test this kind of thing in Beta though as you only have one account on Beta.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Still not a big fan of the change as it literally kills the ''unique'' feel of every alts but meh. Also from a PvP, do i have any reason to play competitively my alts and try to go for Grand Marshal for example on my rogue, if all my alts already get the title from my Hunter? Also, lets say i get Gladiator as a Hunter or Rogue, it doesn't mean i can actually reach such rating as a Resto Shaman or Mage for example. Even from the PvE side, its not because i killed H:Madness as a Hunter that i could effectively heal the fight on a Resto Druid for example. <br />
<br />
Grinding achievements is also fun for some people, i have Battlemaster on 2 characters, i find it extremely fun to go for those goals when i bg, instead of just killing people for the sake of it, it means i'm not allowed to go for Battlemaster on say, my rogue anymore?<br />
<br />
Idk, feels it removes more options and create more problems than it solve.<br />
<br />
You can still earn them again, you just don't earn the points again. The game will still recognize that you earned the achievement on the alt, even if you have it unlocked account-wide.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I remember that they said at Blizzcon (I think) that in MOP most mounts / pets will become BOE (I don't mean BOA).... For example someone tested this out by importing a wow account with unlearned childrens week pets onto the Beta and all the childrens week pets were BOE.<br />
<br />
What i'm wondering is will the argent tournament mounts become BOE and thus give the other faction a chance to get those mounts ? The pets are already BOE so it doesn't seem that unlikely or impossible. I've already started doing these daily quests again to get my alliance character the horde mounts from the argent tournament.<br />
<br />
The other thing i'm wondering about is Ashes of A'lar (and other rare mounts such as Rivendare's Deathcharger). I already have this mount on my alliance hunter but if it was to become BOE i'd start farming it again for gold....</div></div><hr />

<br />
And someone once mentioned &quot; how will i know a player is good bc now their alts have all these good achievements.. how do i know this dude is good on his alt?&quot; HELLo HOW ABOUT DOING IT THE OLD FASHION WAY, test run him, talk to him, ect... you know, what u did b4 there was achievements in the game.. sheesh. <br />
Im sorry but If i spend 2 years grinding out Battlemaster and mounts/ titles ect... heck ya I wanna show it on whatever character i play., bc no my mage didnt earn it I DID!. <br />
And if for some reason my guild no longer needs my mage and they need a healer... I roll a healer, then yes i should have the same achievements show on my healer bc i as a player earned them. <br />

Let me ask you, what's the point of doing achievements at all if you think doing them twice is a chore?<br />
<br />
You may answer this question with &quot;it's a personal challenge&quot;, and that's the answer I want you to think about. Nobody is forcing you to do all this, you don't get anything (read this loosely) from doing achievements. It's the struggle to get them that makes some people do them. So no, Blizzard is not giving you the middle finger here, you are free to do the Loremaster six times if you please because it's your personal struggle and accomplishment.<br />
<br />
I welcome the introduction to this and it's not because I don't want to kill Deathwing on my i.e. panda in Mists, it's because I personally do not enjoy doing achievements at all. But for people who do LIKE to do achievements I wish and hope you realize that this won't kill it for you. Do your achievements and pretend your already earned part ain't there.<br />

I am not a big fan of leveling alts , playing alts at all . Actually i have been playing my pala since the start of BC , and i enjoy it . I love it ! Also i am a big achievement whore , mount and pet collector . I would rather spend hours to farm for mounts / pets than just idle in Orgrimmar . I have gathered enough FOS achiements , and still working on some . <br />
<br />
But , what i am disappointed at is that all this shared mounts and achievements will go a bit over the hand . <br />
<br />
1. Does that mean i will have to start leveling alts to be able to farm *11 times each raid / heroic that drops certain mounts ? Cause that's just scary , and messy .<br />
2. Will i be able to ride my Charger on let's say , my UD mage ? 0_0<br />
3. What about the Druid / Lock FOS Mounts ? Why would i have to get penalized for not leveling alts / completing certain achievements on alts ? <br />

I don't wanna have to be 'forced' to start playing on alts , to start farming content over and over , reset after reset . And do belive me most of the mounts / pets collectors will do that .

When, of the vocal people, you are in the vast minority then it really doesn't matter. You are attempting to oppose a change that (almost) everyone else is embracing because of the way that view achievements which is contrary to the rest of the community and the change that the designers are making.</div></div><hr />

1. It means that you CAN farm a mount (insert number of toons here) a lock out, not that you have to.<br />
2. Per the GC post they are looking at restricting mounts by faction and by level. I'm willing to bet they will do the same for class specific mounts though its not currently working that way on beta, but its the first implementation of a feature on beta so take that for what its worth.<br />
3. The Druid and lock FoS mounts? What do you mean?<br />

For people that don't play alts nothing is changing.</div></div><hr />

I just don't wanna start playing alts for the sake of *11 resets / week . Thank you and sorry for my bad english .<br />

<br />
I am not a big fan of leveling alts , playing alts at all . Actually i have been playing my pala since the start of BC , and i enjoy it . I love it ! Also i am a big achievement whore , mount and pet collector . I would rather spend hours to farm for mounts / pets than just idle in Orgrimmar . I have gathered enough FOS achiements , and still working on some . <br />
<br />
But , what i am disappointed at is that all this shared mounts and achievements will go a bit over the hand . <br />
<br />
1. Does that mean i will have to start leveling alts to be able to farm *11 times each raid / heroic that drops certain mounts ? Cause that's just scary , and messy .<br />
2. Will i be able to ride my Charger on let's say , my UD mage ? 0_0<br />
3. What about the Druid / Lock FOS Mounts ? Why would i have to get penalized for not leveling alts / completing certain achievements on alts ? <br />

For people that don't play alts nothing is changing.<br />

Two years, 6 days ago, I completed the &quot;School of Hard Knocks&quot; and thus got &quot;What a Long, Strange Trip It's Been&quot;. Ever since, I've been hoping this would go account-wide. Today, in earnest, that hope has been answered, positively.<br />
<br />
I will now proceed to pop open a few beer cans and slam them, Stone Cold-style.<br />
<br />
I'm just wishing Blizzard would let us know if the Master Riding Skill attached to that achievement is intended to be rewarded when it goes live or not. <br />
<br />
50,000 is a lot of gold to save, if you have ten alts (as of MoP) without the highest riding skill.<br />
<br />

I dunno, mate, but my DK has over 5,800 Marks of the World Tree.<br />
<br />
I can't remember how many dailies that is, but given he's exalted with Netherwing, Skyguard, has that many marks, has every pet and mount from the Argent Tourney... I'll check.<br />

<br />
12,869 daily quests completed as of today.</div></div><hr />

If you've completed that many daily quests on one character, I doubt 50k gold is really that big of a deal. Besides, 50k might have been a big deal to some in wrath but it certainly wasn't much when cata launched (which was when I quit). I can't imagine it's going to be even remotely challenging to obtain that much yet another expansion later.</div></div><hr />

Oh, I've got several times that amount. I just never like forking out for some reason. <br />

If I can save gold somewhere I'm likely to do what I can do accomplish that. Especially with new mounts coming out!</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's only speculation at the moment, given they didn't LITERALLY say that you will be granted the Master Flying Skill with the mount. However, as of a few days ago when I last toyed with the beta, it was indeed awarding the flight skill. I would surely love to hope so, because I lost a chunk of sanity to getting those achievements towards the Meta [I'm stabbing daggers into a Children's Week orphan effigy in honor of &quot;School of Hard Knocks&quot; here], and if I can save some gold in the process, I could put it to greater good for the remainder of my alts. I have my server (with the DK that has the mount) full at the moment, with 9 playable alts and 1 bank-toon. If I could save 45k, I wouldn't knock it. After all, it would seem a bit anti-climactic to award the mount and NOT award the skill at the same time PLUS make you pay for the skill. =\<br />
<br />
Time will tell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
*special snowflake detection system activated*<br />
You worked in a game... congratulations for working instead of having fun and playing.<br />
<br />
Can you answer one question for me : did you get that achievement because a) you liked to PvP and were good at it, or b) just to show off with the title?<br />
if the answer is &quot;a&quot;, then why does it matter that someone else gets it too?<br />
if the answer is &quot;b&quot;, I suggest you to go outside, because outside you will realise that nobody in your neighborhood knows or gives a damn about that title.<br />
<br />
and inb4: I don't PvP, but in raids, the thing you mention (i.e. achievements getting easier over time) happens constantly.<br />
<br />
OT: I welcome this change, although I don't have achievements scattered around characters. I stil play my first main, and it has always been my main, so I have all the titles, mounts and pets on that character.<br />
Now my alts will be able to fly more mounts and have more pets as well.<br />

I am a bit confused about this whole new account wide achievements .<br />
<br />
I am not a big fan of leveling alts , playing alts at all . Actually i have been playing my pala since the start of BC , and i enjoy it . I love it ! Also i am a big achievement whore , mount and pet collector . I would rather spend hours to farm for mounts / pets than just idle in Orgrimmar . I have gathered enough FOS achiements , and still working on some . <br />
<br />
But , what i am disappointed at is that all this shared mounts and achievements will go a bit over the hand . <br />
<br />
1. Does that mean i will have to start leveling alts to be able to farm *11 times each raid / heroic that drops certain mounts ? Cause that's just scary , and messy .<br />
2. Will i be able to ride my Charger on let's say , my UD mage ? 0_0<br />
3. What about the Druid / Lock FOS Mounts ? Why would i have to get penalized for not leveling alts / completing certain achievements on alts ? <br />
<br />
I don't wanna have to be 'forced' to start playing on alts , to start farming content over and over , reset after reset . And do belive me most of the mounts / pets collectors will do that . I just don't wanna start playing alts for the sake of *11 resets / week . Thank you and sorry for my bad english .<br />
<br />
1.	You can, but you don’t have to. It is your choice, and the only one that is forcing you is yourself. You can level up characters to do the content, and it will lower your total running time, but not the real effort time. i.e it takes you less resets/weeks since you increase the drop chance by having more goes in a week, but you still have to run it X times ( so you spend less weeks but more time in that week) I can live with that.<br />
2.	at the moment on beta you can, but I think and actually hope they change it, since it doesn’t make sense lorewise for a DK to ride a paladin mount. If they don’t change it, I’ll be levelling a paladin tailor/engineer and a warlock for the mounts, but that will be my own choice and not something I was forced to do. As for profession mounts: you could already have it in your inventory, counting towards the achievements, but you could only use it if you had the profession still. (for this I will be levelling my tailor/engineer anyway)<br />
3.	same actually as number 2: I think they will change that part, just like they made faction specific mounts only available to that faction.<br />

<br />
I am nearing 5500 atm. So 2500 is not that brutal anymore. It all depends on how much time you spend on a character really. <br />
I have always seen dailies as a good way to earn money, and at the same time work on associated rep or goodies.</div></div><hr />

Common achivements will only get you the points once. So you will not get 2x10 points for clearing Hour of Twilight on 2 chars. You will only keep 10 points.</div></div><hr />

You look at your individual characters achievements and then there is a check box for &quot;all characters&quot; and scores/text adjust accordingly.<br />
