<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">link_991</div><div class="date">2010-06-03, 01:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I understand Blizzcon has gone popular over the last few years and there are more and more nerds wanting to be present but the nerve... oh the nerve. One hundred and fifty bucks for a two day event is just outrageous. And its not like they will introduce 3 new games. Oh no. There will be Cataclysm (which we have all already seen), Diablo 3 and Starcraft 2, in short: OLD NEWS! Sure, maybe there will be a glimpse of the brand new MMO but guess what - THATS ONE HELL OF A HUGE IF!<br />
<br />
I don't want to appear as a hater to everyone who has the opportunity to actually attend Blizzcon this year, but to be honest, I would spend those money on something more viable than this... just my two cents I guess ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
you forgot about the goodies. and the fact the stuff shown won't just be the same stuff they've already put online themselves<br />
<br />
<br />
Fun Fact: Before Activision came into the picture the Blizzcon tickets were only $100 each.<br />
<br />
Fun Fact: Activision is a sibling company to Blizzard not a Parent company that has control over Blizzard.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
150 bucks? Are you serious? Wasn't it only like.. 30 last year? that is ridiculous.<br />
<br />
<br />
They cost $125 last year, $40 for the internet stream/DirectTV</div></div><hr />

I won't even think about buying one. I'll have other fill me in, I suppose.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was 125.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Fun Fact: Before Activision came into the picture the Blizzcon tickets were only $100 each.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fun Fact: There were also about half the amount of tickets available than currently, much less room at the convention centre, and they spent a lot less on the entertainment. Ozzy? :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The goodie bag alone is usually worth $200+. $300 on a good year (2008 was amazing).<br />
<br />
Well worth it imo.</div></div><hr />

lolwut? A buck fifty? A professional convention?<br />
<br />
It's $150, not $1.50. And Blizzcon is incredibly professional.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Some of us are paying over $1000 just to go there, if you guys complain about a ticket costing $25 more than last year, stop taking a morning coffee for a month.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
that's my point, $150 is pocket change. <br />
<br />
professional conventions for say, cisco, is 4 figures. NANOG is like $500 for the EARLY registration. <br />
<br />
for the quality of the convention, the tickets are amazingly cheap</div></div><hr />

Anyone know how many they are selling today? Saturday?<br />
<br />
Edit: apparently not that many I went up like 400 places and stock dropped by 8%<br />
<br />
(quick math puts that at ~5000 tickets today.)</div></div><hr />

You know, I went to the Tokyo Game Show when I was in Japan and it only cost me 10 bucks, not kidding. Maybe it's an American thing to make things like this so expensive.<br />
<br />
Those that have the money to throw away, have fun! I wish I could justify that much money for a 2 day convention...</div></div><hr />

I started at about 3400, and am at 2000 right now. The stock is at 75%. 1400/0.25=5600. Obviously a little inexact, but probably pretty close.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you forget that is x5. or to be conservative x3, I GUESS not everyone will get 5 tickets.<br />
<br />
<br />
edit:4035 in queue, 45% stock. no chance i'm getting any.<br />
<br />
edit: 2850 in queue, sold out pops up.<br />
<br />
From the count I saw, that was ~7k in line, ~3k turned away. 4k x 5 = ~20k tickets sold, sounds about right.</div></div><hr />

My only problem with the whole purchasing multiple tickets thing is that they would have had to change the number and then hit purchase. Considering how many people just clicked checkout I doubt that they'd get any.<br />
<br />

Blizzard is NOT the parent company. Blizzard is owned by a Media giant called Vivendi. (www.vivendi.com) The only<br />
reason Blizzard's name was tagged with Activision is because of its huge success in the gaming industry.</div></div><hr />

Fun fact: When tickets sell out in hours. that means there's more demand than supply, so you should sell those tickets for more, or find a way to provide more tickets. Otherwise they just get resold on ebay for even more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How can they sell them on Ebay? I thought in years past you had to bring a photo ID and the credit card you used in order to pick up the tickets.</div></div><hr />

me and some friends were going to blizzcon untill we found out every hotel in the area was booked or way to expensive. gonna host a tacos and LAN party with streaming blizzcon on a video cannon. and beers, lots and lots of beer!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skylla05</div><div class="date">2010-06-03, 02:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I understand Blizzcon has gone popular over the last few years and there are more and more nerds wanting to be present but the nerve... oh the nerve. One hundred and fifty bucks for a two day event is just outrageous. And its not like they will introduce 3 new games. Oh no. There will be Cataclysm (which we have all already seen), Diablo 3 and Starcraft 2, in short: OLD NEWS! Sure, maybe there will be a glimpse of the brand new MMO but guess what - THATS ONE HELL OF A HUGE IF!<br />
<br />
I don't want to appear as a hater to everyone who has the opportunity to actually attend Blizzcon this year, but to be honest, I would spend those money on something more viable than this... just my two cents I guess ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
150 for a 2 day event outrageous? Are you kidding?<br />
<br />
In 1994, I paid $185 a ticket to see Pink Floyd on their Pulse tour. A 3.5 hour concert 16 years ago. I saw the Eagles oh, 8 years ago or so, and the tickets were about $125.<br />
<br />
I also had to pay 40 bucks for a t-shirt at each event.<br />
<br />
And a 2 day entertainment event where you get a goodie bag full of stuff that everyone that goes to Blizzcon (and a lot of WoW players) would want, for $150 is outrageous?<br />
<br />
Haha. Hardly.</div></div><hr />

If you have been playing for a while since vanilla and are a huge wow/sc/diablo fan then blizzcons for you, if not enjoy the casual route or order it on TV for 50 bucks.....</div></div><hr />

Should cata be out before Blizzcon or will it still be in development?<br />

Development - most likely late stages of Beta.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wanna know how they are able to sell them and the people that they sell them too are able to pick them up.<br />
<br />
If they force you to show the credit card used to purchase or a photo id how can you sell it on ebay?<br />
<br />
Two options i came up with<br />
1. Get a credit card then cancel it once the purchase is done, then mail the credit card to the person who bought it.<br />
2. You live or vacation to the area and pick up the tickets then pass them off to the buyer.</div></div><hr />

It's always been right after the school year started for me, but I was gonna make the sacrifice and miss a week of class to go out there this year, until I found out it wasn't gonna be in the first week or two, when nothing important happens. :(<br />
<br />
Oh well, it's always interesting to see the huge queues for Blizzcon and how damn fast they sell out of tickets. They really need to instance this thing!</div></div><hr />

u doesnt need any credit card to show it would be against ur privacy, u only need to show VALID ID with photo and thats all there is nothing about credit card in Blizzcon 2010 FAQ<br />
and from what i have read u can buy that tickets and u are able to fill all details in it by hand after u purchase it untill 21/6/2010.</div></div><hr />

Agreed. I would kill to be able to go, but I live nowhere near it. Also, I would probably pay 150 bucks just for the goodie bag. I like goodie bags.</div></div><hr />

$150 on their website.<br />
<br />
$500 on ebay.<br />
<br />
Buy 5 tickets and you've got the plane ticket, hotel, and expenses paid for.</div></div><hr />
