Patch 5.3 - Brawler's Guild Changes<br />
Patch 5.3 adds several new bosses to the Brawler's Guild, as well as some other things:<br />
<br />
<br />
Card Trader Ami will sell you cards (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-search=Challenge+Card) that allow you to fight bosses from ranks you have already defeated.<br />
Defeating some of the new bosses will give you access to some of the new Brawler's Guild shirts (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3216-Brawler-s-Guild-Shirts-World-First-Level-90-April-18-Hotfixes-Blue-Posts-Fan-Art). Defeating all of them will give you the http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/98543.jpg Wraps of the Blood-Soaked Brawler (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/98543-wraps-of-the-blood-soaked-brawler).<br />
A new VIP lounge has been added on the zeppelin circling the arena for Rank 8 players. The Alliance also have a VIP lounge in the balcony.<br />
Reaching Rank 9 will give you another invite to the brawler's guild.<br />
Reaching Rank 10 rewards access to purchase the http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/98405.jpg Brawler's Burly Mushan Beast (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/98405-brawlers-burly-mushan-beast).<br />
Spectator totems and consoles have been added to give you a better view of the fight.<br />
The Alliance fight pit floor has been raised to make it easier to view the fight.<br />
<br />

The boss in the video preview image above is Hexos. You must constantly turn so that he does not hit any of the incoming rectangles, while doing ~100K DPS.<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
Talking a lot about class cooldowns. We could lower CDs or lower magnitude and buff sustained. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330757618790453248))<br />
This could have both PvE and PvP benefits. The CD effects would be harder to notice though. Thoughts? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330757848223080449))<br />
Imagine Recklessness as a 10% crit buff or a nerfed GoaK on a 2-3 min timer along with sustained DPS buff. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330758033036693504))<br />
<br />
Curious: what do you feel is the best crit %, from a &quot;fun to play&quot; perspective? Assume dps is normalized.<br />
Assuming nothing procs from crit? I'd say something like 15-20%. If you're depending on procs etc. then much higher. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331871953856126976))<br />
<br />
Do you feel hunters need the most work out of all the pures for spec differences and dmg output as of now for 6.0?<br />
We think rogues and hunters need more spec differentiation. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332638999447486464))<br />
<br />
Do you feel warlocks are generally behind most other pure dps classes in terms of damage and cc (especially mages, rogues)?<br />
Warlocks? No. Hunters are the only pure that feel a little low, and we are buffing them slightly in 5.3. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332548750444744704))<br />
<br />
Hey GC. How do you feel about DoT snapshotting being an important part of some specs DPS? Seems opaque and complex imo.<br />
It can be opaque and complex. It can also be one of those things to let really skilled players stand out. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332568637078634496))<br />
I've said a few times lately that we're cool with difficult hoops for marginal gains. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332568887063347200))<br />
But if the gains aren't marginal then the hoops feel mandatory. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332568937529233408))<br />
Is there any way to win there? Or is this just another knife's-edge situation?<br />
We just need to make sure that players who want to skip those complications still have fun. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332573407466123266))<br />
<br />
so why does shape shifting as a druid clear movement impaires but not shaman's ghost wolf? + the additional 10% speed increase<br />
That's just a druid class benefit. We try not to have every class mechanic work the exact same way. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331572315148124161))<br />

are you happy with how the current dk resource system works? Or do you feel the rune system was better in wrath?<br />
Honestly not sure. Current model solves the orphaned rune and GCD lock problems better, but it is complicated. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332549022998999041))<br />
<br />
Why weren't DK dots nerfed to refresh their strength instead of messing with the numbers on FeS, SS, and UM?<br />
We wanted the Festerblight style to be optional, not mandatory. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331925261006303232))<br />
It doesn't look like much of an option anymore as it now relies on getting tricks + unrealistic execution to be optimal<br />
The problem might be Tricks. We may have overnerfed the FB damage. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331937345576263680))<br />
<br />

any though on makeing more glyphs baseline like glyph of lifebloom for resto druids?<br />
When it makes sense. If we make every good glyph baseline then we need to make more glyphs (and hope they aren't too good). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331927391133917184))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/271-Hunter) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/hunter) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#M))<br />
Many hunters want a MM completely re-design. Possible?<br />
I would use that word with caution. It would not be at the warlock level. Are there things we can do? Yes. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332644407037800448))<br />
<br />
Marks/Surv feel less developed now that most of their appeals were made into talents. They feel less flavorful now<br />
We want the spec choice to come down to kit or specific rotation. (Agree that hunters need work on both.) (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332552307747196928))<br />
Marks rotation feels like the most rewarding. BS baseline will be nice. BM is more survivable than survival though<br />
My perception (which could be wrong) is SV hunters are the most likely to be sad when they can't play their spec. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332638856845328384))<br />
<br />
So what's the verdict on Scater/Trap DR GC?<br />
We aren't changing it for 5.3 (meaning it will be as on live). We nerfed some BM pet CC instead. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331927629986922496))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/273-Paladin) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/paladin) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#I))<br />
Can you give any insight as to why the Cata version of Sacred Shield was removed from Ret? And is it possible it will return?<br />
Honestly, it's because in Cata so many paladins asked for the LK version back. I guess we could alternate every expansion. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331870450353336323))<br />
Is it not possible to have the Cata version of Sacred Shield baseline for Ret while also having the talent choice?<br />
One of the issues is that Ret mostly takes SH while Prot only takes SS. Maybe both Ret and Prot would want (Cata) SS as a talent. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331923562137014272))<br />
Could replace current talent with the Cataclysm Sacred Shield and give the current one to Prot baseline I guess. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331870657967173632))<br />
<br />

Why did u diceded to decrease amount of armor ignored on Find Weakness?<br />
PvE buff and PvP nerf. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332566897990176768))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/276-Shaman) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/shaman) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#c))<br />
Will enhancement get a overhaul/ new resource system anytime soon? Feels old and clunky and enhance got so much potential! <br />
Overall, we don't foresee adding new resources (like Holy Power or Embers) to any existing classes or specs soon. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331929459164868608))<br />
We're pretty happy with Enhance's cooldown-driven rotation. Major changes aren't likely soon. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331929325333016576))<br />
<br />
Could we at least ask for options to modify ascendance damage and move it to outside the cooldown?<br />
The concern is that shifting too much DPS out of CDs makes the CDs feel meh. It's nice when you can really feel them. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332538391759560705))<br />
This may be true but it changes the pvp meta game. Some may like it but I don't and some of my mates quit.<br />
That's the concern and why we're floating the idea out there rather than just doing it for 5.3. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332573565054513152)<br />
<br />

Are you done with affliction pvp for 5.3? I am not playing ptr so i would love to know how do you think its performing atm.<br />
We don't get a ton of PvP testing on smaller patches like this so most of our information is just player feedback. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330485955624574976))<br />
We like Aff rotation in PvE, but we're worried that MG and SB:SS hold them back in PvP. Would rather just have strong dots. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330486134591336448))<br />
<br />
Currently, RoF feels really clunky for Warlocks to use in single target fights, but it's required. Any plans to change this? To which I mean, doesn't feel like it belongs there in the single target rotation. Just feels clunky and annoying. Thoughts?<br />
We agree. We didn't remove it for 5.3 because we'd want to buff ember generation to compensate. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332549925609037824))<br />
<br />
When would we see the change to increase ember generation (without relying on RoF to generate embers)?<br />
My guess is 5.4. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332548862063546369))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/278-Warrior) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/warrior) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#E))<br />
How come arms warriors lost shield slam/shield block if you want to do more with them?<br />
Because shield macros suck. You will see quite often our dev style is one step back, two steps forward. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330443571293466625))<br />
We make short-term changes that are good for the game but against our long-term goals, which understandably confuses players. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330443687714750464))<br />
<br />
Warriors are just HORRIBLE on PTR. Dead in three seconds, dominated by ranged classes. Enough already.<br />
What changed from live? We buffed warrior defenses and no caster should have gotten large DPS buffs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330760671304249346))<br />
<br />
So you are saying you can't just put down a blocking volume around your Battlegrounds edges to stop that?<br />
If the solutions are that obvious, chances are they've already been considered and rejected. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330758365582065665))<br />
<br />
Toxic Behavior<br />
What did you think of Riot's Toxic Player Behavior presentation at GDC? Any lessons that can be applied to WoW?<br />
I think it's awesome. A lot of lessons that can be applied to WoW (or any game) but hard to go into via twitter. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331888348031483904))<br />
<br />
What do you think Blizz can do better, if anything, to combat toxic attitudes within the WoW community?<br />
Interesting Q. We removed the need for friends in order to see content, which is awesome, but we didn't insert anything in place. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331877507831824385))<br />
With friends, you are happy somebody got loot. In LFR, other players are tools to get what you want. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331877709544300544))<br />
Providing more info to players so they didn't have to know all the tribal secrets would help. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331878096884101121))<br />
Letting you care a little more about the group would help. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331878082350829569))<br />
But honestly, I find most players I interact with are helpful and generally pretty nice. I understand there are always bad apples. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331878204447010817))<br />
<br />
Player Subscription Losses<br />
You have lost 1.3 million subscribers because the game is to time consuming for us casuals. Bring back tabards. Dailies suck<br />
We heard from A LOT of players in Cataclysm that they didn't have enough to do and got bored. It's a tough sweet spot to hit. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332556505230503938))<br />
<br />
I hope you folks realize your sub drop cannot continue <br />
I can't imagine the original devs expected the game to go on as long as it has. Keep playing and we'll keep developing. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332555976291000320))<br />
<br />
Activision Q1: 1.3M lost subs, how much was PVE &amp; PVP? Can you hear player feedback now? Class balance &amp; cut time sinks!<br />
The losses were mostly in Asia. China's game market has matured amazingly in only a few years. They release many MMOs a year. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332550598371184640))<br />
<br />
LFR has cut into raiders avail for normals. Low motivation since end boss killed on release. Led to sub-unsub cycle?<br />
Most of the losses were in Asia, where the raiding culture is pretty different. Recall, they have 3 lockouts already. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332539558656892928))<br />
<br />
Another 1.3 million subscribers gone. Can we start agreeing that maybe pushing out new dailies every patch is not great?<br />
Players come for new expansions and then drift away. This is nothing new and why we are trying to release expansions faster. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332541745776689152))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
You may be releasing patches fast but most of them are bare bones. 2 major patches = 2 daily hubs and a raid. The end.<br />
What is a patch that you thought offered a reasonable amount of content? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331892331668197378))<br />
5.2 was good but would have been better with a 5 man or 2. But least you aknowledge no 5 mans was a mistake.<br />
Not a mistake, in that we wouldn't change it if we could do it all again. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331926115717353473))<br />
More of a compass heading that we'd like to figure out a way to do it all in the future. Dungeons are cool. We get that. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331926253932257280))<br />
<br />
Why is it a problem if I like to repeatedly run dungeons? Am I doing it wrong if that's what I find fun?<br />
Nope, and we try to support it. We just don't make that the most rewarding way because we think it's good for the long term game. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331875041534959616))<br />
We have found that making things too convenient and letting players focus too much on small parts of the game leads to burn out. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331875178562850816))<br />
I know it might seem a paradox that a more convenient game is less compelling, but our data supports it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331875469198778369))<br />
Yet your two most succesful expansions had it as the most rewarding way. What you are doing is WRONG<br />
Our two most successful expansions had terrible class balance too. I'm not sure that's why they were successful. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332565847824551936))<br />
<br />
You forced me to do what I don't like or even hate: scenarios, dailies, pet battles, brawler guild and etc.<br />
I can understand scenarios and dailies. Why would you do pet battles and brawler's guild if you don't enjoy them? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332543112524218368))<br />
There are achievements for pet battles? You have to gain them even if you hate it.Just so others can see big numbers<br />
Achievements are the epitome of optional. If you're saying you are forced to do achievements then... I don't know. More gin. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332635750170492928))<br />
<br />
Just to play devils advocate. I would like 1 raid + Silvermoon, please. Then you will say &quot;The majority would not&quot;.<br />
I don't know what the majority would say. But we don't design around majorities. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331880504515248128))<br />
The majority would say buff paladins because they are often the most popular class. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331880590955663360))<br />
<br />
Is the Black market AH successful in takeing gold out of the economy? What sort of adjustments would you make?<br />
Not sure. Pretty happy with it overall. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331876482764918785))<br />
<br />
The vast majority of the playerbase enjoy slower patches so we can enjoy one's content longer. ICC was great.<br />
Look, if I'm not comfortable speaking on behalf of &quot;the vast majority of the playerbase&quot; I don't see how you can be... (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331889839702167552))<br />
I'll buy that you and maybe a lot of your friends feel that way, which is totally legit. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331889908065107968))<br />
But we also have a lot of data about how players spend their time and when various players tire of a certain patch. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331890063703171072))<br />
<br />
Your a multimillion dollar company, Hire a new artist. Do not say we are picky about who we hire. (Multimillion)<br />
I don't think hiring anyone who walked through the door would give you the quality of art your are looking for. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331880053841481728))<br />
<br />
I'd take that over more broken pvp, or fast raid releases. If hardcore raiders are the minority, why cater to them?<br />
If we don't care about small minorities, then we should stop supporting trolls and dwarves. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331874680145313793))<br />
<br />
well we all thought that Cataclysm was going to include the BC starting zones since they are in fact in Azeroth!<br />
We thought the BE and Draenei start zones had aged much better than the older ones. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331873070434353157))<br />

<br />
We summarized (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3239-Patch-5-3-Pet-Battle-Spectating-Blue-Tweets-Riot-Toxic-Player-Behavior-Fan-Art) Riot's GDC presentation on Toxic Player Behavior.<br />
We looked at how Pet Battle Spectating (http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=iZkIPmZMFzk) appears to other players.<br />
The WoWkemon addon (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3239-Patch-5-3-Pet-Battle-Spectating-Blue-Tweets-Riot-Toxic-Player-Behavior-Fan-Art) also gives your battle status and lets you spectate from anywhere with other players on your realm.<br />

Patch 5.3 PTR Build 16924 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3240-Patch-5-3-PTR-Build-16924-5-3-Official-PTR-Notes-Update-Pet-Battle-Spectating) appeared with a few small changes and the official Patch 5.3 PTR notes were updated.<br />
<br />
May 8<br />
<br />
WoW dropped to 8.3 million subscribers, a loss of 1.3 million in the first quarter. <br />
Most of the decline in subscribers came from China, where there have been many other MMOs launched recently.<br />
Heart of the Swarm was the #1 PC game of the quarter, selling 1.1 million copies in two days.<br />
<br />
May 9<br />
<br />
Patch 5.3 is going to reduce the cost (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3244-Cheaper-Patch-5-2-Heirlooms-Preparing-for-Patch-5-3-Valor-Points-Rewards-HS-Video) for the upgrade heirlooms added in Patch 5.2 by 60%.<br />
There was a Hearthstone Fireside Duel and Q&amp;A session (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3244-Cheaper-Patch-5-2-Heirlooms-Preparing-for-Patch-5-3-Valor-Points-Rewards-HS-Video).<br />

Ouch, you should probably see an ortho about your knee after that.<br />
<br />
He's talking about seeing raid content. You know, the single most difficult and time-consuming aspect of MMO's for companies to get right -- which Blizzard has done consistently for nine years. Why wouldn't you want as many people as possible to experience that which you poured most of your resources into?<br />

That's quite the non sequitur there. The tweet GC was replying to was implying that this sub drop marks the beginning of the end for a game that still has 8 million subscribers after nine years. What GC is saying is that even if those 8 million people all cancelled their subs tomorrow, World of Warcraft has been a massive success beyond anyone's wildest imagination -- including the original developers.</div></div><hr />

I'm ok with an easy mode. I don't think it should be a stepping stone to proper raiding, and I definitely don't think easy mode should include the removal of the social aspect. If you're absolutely awful and you have 4 hours every week to play, then by all means have a mode with bosses with practically no abilities. I don't see how anybody has more fun by being exempt of the social aspect. There are tons of games already that don't include it, and I don't want to see WoW turned any closer to it. And more importantly, I don't want its developers to think that the removal of the social aspect is &quot;awesome&quot;. The social aspect made wow what it is.</div></div><hr />

The original devs of WoW didn't really make Ulduar either. The team grew with each expansion, so unless you solely love launch content, then the new devs that have been added over time have made things you like.</div></div><hr />

Well, if you made an FPS game with a difficult end boss, would you implement a mode allowing you to fight the boss as if it was an RTS? WoW is a MMORPG, LFR is removing the MMORPG part of it. Kind of weird.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Indeed, according to the conference call bullet points, casual players aren't being engaged enough, and I think a lot of it really is the emphasis on solo play this expansion, including LFR. Few friendships are forged in a LFR environment, whereas you might make a friend or two in a normal mode pug. Communication is pretty much optional.<br />
<br />
Many of my guildies over the years said they kept playing for the people/social aspect. With WoW's huge playerbase that was one of the main draws. Now that server transfers are killing off a lot of servers and we're spending time doing pet battles, dailies, and LFR, there's not enough social activity going on. Blizz probably realizes that and they're going to try to get players back into normal somehow or do that 'beer league' idea at least.<br />
<br />
Time will tell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And what if I'm in my current guild because that one long raid once per week is the one time I have time for such a long session without breaks? The rest of the week I can still play, just in shorter sessions. How the hell am I gonna find a guild that wants to raid one hour at a time on some random afternoon that I might have off?<br />

<br />
Most of my out-of-guild friends stopped playing over the course of Cataclysm. Are you telling me I'm not supposed to have something to enjoy in this game without the need for them to be online and available at the exact same times that I am? My daily life does not run like clockwork. My schedule can be completely random. And that is why I enjoy the options for things to do that does not require 4-9 of your friends to be online. Because there's no way in hell any of them would be able to fit into my schedule whatsoever.<br />

<br />
Then you're in the right guild. I'm totally fine with not being able to see raid content when you can only play 30 minutes here and there with no prior knowledge to when that might be. There is plenty of other content in WoW to fit that playstyle. Don't come here and change raiding, which is what fits my playstyle, to fit yours. I won't poop on your dailies, scenarios, questing and random BGs. Ok?</div></div><hr />

<br />
In reverse, I don't expect you to poop on &quot;my&quot; LFR. Normal and Heroic raiding hasn't gone anywhere. LFR is merely adding a lower difficulty that at the same time allows for people without a whole lot of time on their hands to still get a fraction of the raid value. The game market is continually evolving. WoW is merely adapting to that by adding content to more diverse playstyles.<br />
<br />
Besides, it's of a lot more value to Blizzard to design things that are seen by millions instead of stuff that is only seen by thousands. Why design something for the 5% when you can design something for the 50%?<br />

Removing dungeon finder and/or LFR would kill off my server entirely. And I'm quite sure most other low-pop realms would follow suit. LFD/LFR is the only thing that has somewhat sustained a mediocre amount of activity on my server for the past 3 years.</div></div><hr />

No one puts a gun to your head and makes you run LFR.... if you are as good as you seem to think you are, you should have gear that doesn't NEED LFR gear to complement it to progress in current content. But i'm sure the rest of your guild holds you back...amirite?</div></div><hr />

Tabards had absolutely nothing to do with the success of WotLK, you can thank WC3 for the most of it. Cataclysm/MoP have no apparent ties to the story that began in warcraft RTS games, and that's why they aren't as succesful, period.</div></div><hr />

The one thing that really sucks about it is that normal/heroic raiders were required to do it, but apparently they are trying really hard to stop that.

I think it's awesome. A lot of lessons that can be applied to WoW (or any game) but hard to go into via twitter.<br />

<br />
And the moment blizzard starts using the word &quot;toxic&quot; to describe any kind of behaviour in their game on their official forums (this is twitter) I will quit their game.

The one thing that really sucks about it is that normal/heroic raiders were required to do it, but apparently they are trying really hard to stop that. I think LFR might work better if all the fights were harder, but shorter, so that it engaged the players more, but not become an insurmountable obstacle.<br />
<br />
The problem with LFR is to me not the difficulty, but the fact it nullifies the &quot;MMO&quot; part of WoW. LFR generally doesn't feel like an MMO, but sadly often a fight with bad scripted bots. From time to time there might be an interesting group where people actually communicate, but that happened much more in pugs, at least back in Wrath.<br />
<br />
Generally the best model so far has been the one we saw in Wrath imo., it made the most sense and there were interesting additions for both PvE and PvP.</div></div><hr />

You think you are being funny but that is a real problem. If you take all the competition and therefore progression out of a MMORPG what have you got left? Pet battles?</div></div><hr />

How many times does this need to be said...<br />
Options? Do YOU understand options? Running dungeons with a tabard was far better than doing any daily, and it was uncapped.<br />
It made us stand in a city, alt-tabbed waiting for queue. This is an MMO, where choices has to be equal, or people surge to whatever method is the easiest. Fact. You know what else is a fact? If you did dailies perhaps 3 times a week, you'd still be unlocking items faster than you could buy them due to valor. But if you're not willing to do this simple task, in a game genre that survives by giving you carrots on sticks, then why should you be able to purchase these items?<br />
<br />
They're not going to admit it was a mistake to remove tabards because it wasn't.<br />
And yeah, I find more enjoyment from the game actually doing something for a faction instead of throwing on a tabard for a faction I slept to Friendly with then forgot about.<br />
<br />
But sadly it's hypothetical, so people are free to speculate how it'd be &quot;better&quot; if the tabard system were still there. Farm a faction for a day or two, then keep capping from dungeons.<br />
Happy to see that Blizzard hasn't caved in to the 4.3 fans who thought the world should be unimportant for character progression.<br />
<br />
And stop trying to attribute sub losses for an 8 year old game to whatever you find unappealing.</div></div><hr />

It was the same with tabard as it is now, only now you do dailies back then you did it with tabards. removing tabards WAS a mistake, making tabards not work to exalted and only revered or something would be a better solution, as it is now you have 1 way of doing it only.</div></div><hr />

Just like tabards was the only way back then. Well, unless you wanted to take the slower route (which barely anyone did) and do the slow dailies.<br />
There's more to the game than Org/SW, and that's why Tabards aren't coming back, sorry.</div></div><hr />
