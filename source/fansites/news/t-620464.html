WotLK World Event - New boss in Karazhan ? 
This is NOT active on live servers for the moment. It looks like one of the upcoming phase of the WotLK world event will feature a new boss located in Karazhan: Prince Tenris Mirkblood. Tenris is part of &lt;The San'layn&gt;. The San'layn is a faction of darkfallen, renegade elves from Quel'Thalas under the rule of the Lich King.

WotLK World Event - New boss in Karazhan ?<br />
This is NOT active on live servers for the moment. It looks like one of the upcoming phase of the WotLK world event will feature a new boss located in Karazhan: Prince Tenris Mirkblood. Tenris is part of &lt;The San'layn&gt;. The San'layn is a faction of darkfallen, renegade elves from Quel'Thalas under the rule of the Lich King. <br />
<br />
The quest<br />
Chamber of Secrets<br />
The Argent Dawn Emissary wants you to search the chamber of Tenris Mirkblood within the Servant's Quarters of Karazhan.<br />
<br />
Description<br />
Excellent, an experienced adventurer. Precisely what we need. There has been talk from the Kirin Tor guarding Medivh's tower that something is amiss with Karazhan. There is a new power lurking within, one that answers neither to the Guardian's magic nor the Legion. From what they've scouted, it appears it is an elven prince called Tenris Mirkblood, and there is reason to believe he serves the Scourge.<br />
<br />
Go, my friend, investigate Mirkblood's chamber, and return with any information you might find.<br />

<br />
This quest is indeed in game and you can actually take a look at it by using the following command (but you won't be able to link it in chat until it's active on servers) : /script DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(&quot;Murlocs are awesome, this quest too: \124cffffff00\124Hquest:12616:70\124h[Chamber of Secrets]\124h\124r&quot;);<br />
<br />
Prince Tenris Murkblood is also in game but you can't spawn him for the moment (and won't be until it's &quot;unlocked&quot; in the event). According to the last datamining I did on beta servers this is how he looks : <br />

<br />
The quest seems to be given by an Argent Dawn Emissary near Karazhan. It doesn't look like this NPC is activated on live servers for the moment.<br />

Europe - Cross-Language Battlegroups<br />
To shorten the queues and provide greater access to warfare between factions, we are currently working on combining existing Battlegroups of different languages, with the aim of creating Battlegroups with higher populations. This change will affect both Battlegrounds and Arenas. Players from realms of different languages will only face each other as opponents in battle and will not be playing on the same faction in Battlegrounds, which will ensure that those playing on your side will speak the same language as you.<br />
<br />
Please note that not all Battlegroups will be merged with another, and this feature will not be affecting the Russian-language Battlegroup. More details on this upcoming change will be provided as development nears completion. <br />
<br />
To clarify, people from another language realm will only be opponents. Opponents may also be from your realm or other realms with the same language as you. <br />
<br />

Europe - 24/10 New realms: Azuremyst and Terokkar<br />
The basics<br />
Realm names: Azuremyst and Terokkar<br />
Language: English<br />
Realm type: Normal (PvE)<br />
Battlegroup: Ruin<br />
Migration: No<br />
Realm forums:<br />
Azuremyst: http://forums.wow-europe.com/board.html?forumId=7100898 (http://forums.wow-europe.com/board.html?forumId=7100898)<br />

<br />
In more words<br />
Today we're opening two new English Normal/PvE realms, named Azuremyst and Terokkar, in the Ruin Battlegroup. These are fresh realms, thus no migration will be allowed to the realms during the first months.<br />
<br />
The realms will open this afternoon/evening.<br />
<br />
Please note that the starting areas may be quite flooded in the beginning, and the population cap is intentionally set a bit lower than normal to not have them even more flooded. The cap will be raised over the coming days as the population spreads out more.</div></div><hr />

You are able to interact with the Crypts door because the game believes your an NPC as a Zombie!<br />
Thats why you are able to interact with loads of things normal players cannot interact with!<br />
- Dragon heads in Orgrimmar and Stormwind<br />

<br />
Obviously the door is near Moroes, the door being active was just interesting in this case.<br />
<br />
However I do remember reading something about the head in Thrall's Throne, and that's a very good point, I'll add it to the post. <br />
<br />
<br />
New sub-zone ?<br />
<br />
There was another interesting change here; the gate in the crypt behind the tower is now functional.. but not to players, only zombies can use it ! However in the current state of the event you won't be able to go past the gate, even after opening it as a zombie.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/october/karazhangate_1_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/october/karazhangate_1.jpg) http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/october/karazhangate_2_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/october/karazhangate_2.jpg) http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/october/karazhangate_3_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/october/karazhangate_3.jpg)<br />
<br />
This crypt has been here since the beginning of the game and inside is a zone named The Well of the Forgotten. This zone is NOT new and it was here even before the release of the Burning Crusade. We're still unsure if the fact that zombies can open the gate is a coincidence due to them being friendly with &quot;monsters&quot; factions, or if it will be used in the WotLK event.<br />
<br />
Below is an exploration movie and a few screenshots of the zone on a non-official server, if this zone is indeed activated on live servers you will obviously find monsters and other nice things here. <br />

<br />
The second part of this news is 80% of speculation and you shouldn't jump to conclusions before seeing it in game. The quest however is definitely in the game files and really looks like it will be used during the event.</div></div><hr />

To shorten the queues and provide greater access to warfare between factions, we are currently working on combining existing Battlegroups of different languages, with the aim of creating Battlegroups with higher populations. This change will affect both Battlegrounds and Arenas. Players from realms of different languages will only face each other as opponents in battle and will not be playing on the same faction in Battlegrounds, which will ensure that those playing on your side will speak the same language as you.<br />
<br />
Please note that not all Battlegroups will be merged with another, and this feature will not be affecting the Russian-language Battlegroup. More details on this upcoming change will be provided as development nears completion. <br />
<br />
To clarify, people from another language realm will only be opponents. Opponents may also be from your realm or other realms with the same language as you. <br />

So what about US realms infested with Brazilians? Half my server is filled with BRs that don't know anything except Portuguese, they make up most of the 5 man/BG Puggers on this server. Am I going to be able to opt out of teaming up with these morons?</div></div><hr />

These &quot;morons&quot; have the same right to play as you...if you are not happy transfer to another realm (Warsong has free transfers and I've seen a lot of the US playerbase transfering).<br />
<br />
The way you feel playing in a server full of brazilians and don't understanding them is the same way a lot of brazilians that don't speak english would feel if they played in a realm full of americans. Myself I play in Frostmane and I only managed to get in a raiding guild because I can speak/write (a bit of) english.<br />
<br />
Personally I'm brazilian, I play at Warsong and I can tell that horde side is about 80% BR and most of the sucessfull guilds in the realm are 100% BR. Basically every single brazilian that starts playing make some research where will he find ppl who he can speak with and find out that the best places to go are Warsong and Gurubashi.<br />
<br />
I belive that most of these &quot;morons&quot; would really like to have a realm hosted in Brazil so everyone could play with something better then 500-800 latency.<br />
<br />
Now show some respect because if you call someone a moron just beacause he can't speak your language then the moron is yourself, because guess what, there are 5,5 billion ppl that don't speak english in the world.</div></div><hr />

I'd have to agree... if the BR you pug with is terribad, its the person not where they are from. I'm on Gurubashi ( Rio De Janeiro of Warcraft Servers ) and I've pugged it up with numerous BR's with no problems. We have a few in guild that are irreplaceable in raids. I think the problem is more in you being stubborn and unacceptable of others. At least they are not doing that stupid &quot;anal&quot; and &quot;murloc&quot; linking in trade chat... jeebus.</div></div><hr />

I never had an issue with the Brazillian players, and I often found them to be superior in skill to many English-speaking players. Occasionally communication in pugs was difficult, but with emotes and rough translations, the job got done. Heck, I got my Epic Druid Flight Form heroic setthek done with a PUG that was 4/5 Brazllian.<br />
<br />
I was often very offended at the &quot;ENGLISH-ONLY PLEASE&quot; players that infested trade chat.<br />

I left Warsong only due to it's login queues. The players there were fine.<br />

Way to support a US Stereotype that makes us hated by the world. The only reason a loser like you even knows English is because you heard it growing up. You're displaying the kind of ignorance that makes it incredibly difficult for the world to get along. Nothing on this game requires people to speak English for your own benefit, so you can either deal with it, or you can go play somewhere else.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zeal</div><div class="date">2008-10-24, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is only one locked door in Kara that has never opened. I've no idea if it was ever named anything else, but it is currently named &quot;Blood Drenched Door&quot;. The door is above The Livery Stable (Attumen), right before entering The Scullery towards the Banquet Hall (Moroes). It leads to a small corner room called the Guardhouse. That's it.<br />
<br />
There was a hidden room that's never been used in Kara, but i can no longer find it in the files (but that could just be me). It seemed like it was part of the upper portion of the main tower anyway, not the lower levels.<br />
<br />
The quest text suggest the boss will be found in the Servant's Quaters (Animal Bosses). There are no doors down there currently, or hidden rooms. There is a small room in one corner with no access to it, but can be viewed simply by looking over it's broken wall. This leads me to beleive his quaters aren't labelled and simply part of the ruins down there, where he will probably be summoned. Doing this is going to require clearing the animal boss trash and dealing with the boss though, so it would be alot of work (compared to most event summonable bosses) to kill him on a regular basis. It's likely a one off only.</div></div><hr />

I don't think they're morons because they speak Portuguese. They're morons because they are stupid.

I've played with these people on my server for years.

No. All BRs except Faces Da Morte (and a few others in high end English guilds) are awful. Not to say that 50% of the English pugs on Gurubashi aren't high-functioning morons.

Stupid11: Funny thing about what you said is that you just described how things are in Warsong....I just pugged a ZA, mixed group: 8 brazilians and 2 americans, all the BRs knew the fights and even those that didn't have awesome gear (read *wearing welfare epics*) did a decent job. Now the 2 americans just screwed everything and managed to wipe the group twice on eagle boss, once in dragonhawk and once in lynx.<br />
<br />
My guess is that most of the good american players left warsong or are on the alliance. Also, many good BR guilds from gurubashi have transfered or rerolled horde on warsong (I'm really serious when I say that 80-90% of the horde players are BR).<br />
<br />
Only thing I ask you for is to choose your words more carefully so you won't insult ppl who have nothing to do with the shittyness of the pugged players you find in your realm.</div></div><hr />

Can you roll one there if you have already a lvl 70 character on another realm? Or are DK's realm specific now so you can roll DK only on those servers where you already have a lvl 70 character?.<br />
<br />
right now you can roll a DK only in realms you already have a 55+, but you can still transfer your newly created DK to a realm with no char at 55+.<br />
Blizzard has stated that they do have plans to allow DK creation in any realm in the future, but at november 13th you won't be able to do that.</div></div><hr />

God I wish more Brazilians on my realm had your grasp of the English language and common sense. :(<br />
<br />
Fine, only Gurubashi BRs are bad (besides those in FDM). ;) Just please, please, PLEASE give me a transfer to a different server Blizzard. I'm tired of all the BR everywhere I try to play in my English game.</div></div><hr />
