Dual-Specialization Price Reduced<br />
The price of Dual-Specialization has been lowered in a recent beta build, it now costs 100 gold and new players who reach level 40 should be able to afford it without too much problem. <br />
<br />

Character Selection Screen - Built-In Theorycraft<br />
In Cataclysm, the character screen will let you check easily how much of stat you need to be capped, calculations for Expertise, Hit Rating, and a few other stats are available. This will probably save you a lot of time when you try to figure out if you really need that extra hit on your shiny new epic. <br />

Build 12804 - Mount Hyjal Update<br />
Mount Hyjal received a very interesting update in the latest beta build. If you visited the zone or looked at screenshots during early beta, you probably remember the huge crater called Archimonde's Vengeance. Well, this subzone is gone and has been replaced with a greatly improved version! The crater is no longer there but the key NPCs of the questlines are still around. <br />

<br />
Hyjal is looking very pretty. Makes me excited about Cata each time I see screenshots from any of the changed or new zones. ;)<br />
<br />
So, Dual spec really is being lowered. I may just wait to give it to my rogue then, but I went ahead and dual specced my paladin anyway, even in the knowledge that they may lower the cost. No big deal, really.<br />
<br />
The added theorycrafting that shows percentages of each stat needed in order to maximise your output is good. It should mean fewer threads asking things like, &quot;Wuts da hit cap fer casterz ?&quot;. &gt;.&lt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
errr the dual cost decrease isn't a big surprise, i always laugh at those who want a refund.. yeah can i get my 1000 gold refund for epic mount at vanilla wow too. come on... yeah it was 1000 gold! Riding was what 100 gold until they switched them around and started depreciating all the prices.<br />
<br />
plently of things to spend gold on, i doubt anyone has everything ever and 200,000 gold cap. although if you do.... jeez get some sun !</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pbean</div><div class="date">2010-08-27, 08:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For those of you whining that you've &quot;wasted&quot; your gold on dual spec: duh, of course you have not! You have been having benefit from it, right? So it hasn't been useless, right? So, it wasn't a waste of money.<br />
<br />
Also why would you want a refund? If they were going to give refunds for everything that has changed over the course of the game, you would get thousands of gold for free each expansion! What about the Ruby Shades from Haris Pilton? Or the fact that professions take less gold to level now? And the mounts, should not forget about them!<br />
<br />
When I buy a house now, and it decreases in value over 10 years and then I decide to sell it... there's no magical dude giving me the difference back. I lost money, I lost investments, that's too bad. But it's not really a problem, because I lived in that house for 10 years and that was great.<br />
<br />
In the same way I've used Dual Spec all this time already and I've had a lot of fun with it. So it's no problem that for new toons it'll be cheaper. And that's just what it is: for new toons.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit, this in particular:<br />
<br />
<br />
A refund on whose bought dual spec would be nice :S<br />

Why so? Prices rise and lower, you've been using your dual spec for a long time i suppose, it served its purpose, no reason to refund you the &quot;loss&quot; lol. Do you also want a refund for riding training since the price was lowered too?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nice fan art, but what's up with the night elf hate/blood elf fanboyism? Ya got an injured night elf druid(or maybe dead) in cat form, and the blood elf that likely did it is now bearing down on a night elf hunter trying to shoot a bow...with no fricken arrow.

How would that work? Sometimes all that hit rating you stacked is useless, sometimes it's great? Also, when it comes to players, hit rating and expertise do tend to vary on how much would be useful(talents that reduce chance to be hit, dodge rating/agility, etc)..though expertise generally isn't worried about in pvp.</div></div><hr />

About me, well, I want an Xp refund, because I leveled 2 chars during early vanilla, and then early BC and early wotlk. It was way more time consuming and I had to get more Xp, I want all of this back when Cata is out to get 1 or 2 free levels, 'cause I deserve it.<br />

<br />
To the ones that say that you should get a refund, especially to the one saying he thinks Blizzard owes him 9000g - How on earth do you figure that ?! Do you also apply this &quot;logic&quot; to the real world ? Do you also complain to the car dealer the year after you bought your car, and demand a refund because the price was lowered ? Are you honestly this naive, or do you just do it because of you being annonymous on the internet ?<br />
<br />
Seriously...wtf</div></div><hr />

<br />
So redoing the entire old world is just not good enough I take it ? And adding new water effects and whatnot. What do you want ? A complete redo to make it shiny like AION perhaps ? And if they did, would it still be WoW ? WoW looks like WoW, and it shouldnt change too much from the original concept. How many other games do you see that do a complete revamp of ALL the graphic just because the PC´s can handle more today than they could 5 years ago ?<br />
<br />
The only game(s) im aware of that did this is the Monkey Island series, and while it IS cool to play it with the new graphics, I tend to actually switch to the old graphic because thats what I remember and one of the things I loved most about the old games. But this was done 20 years after the original release of Monkey Island, and while it was a big undertaking, its nothing compared to the tast it would be to redo WoW. And is it _really_ necessary to rede the whole thing just to get new people on board ? I really dont think so.<br />
<br />
One of the reasons they redid Monkey Island was to have an entire new generation enjoy these awesome games that we &quot;old timers&quot; played and loved when we were teens...But WoW is 5 years old...thats hardly enough time for a generation change.</div></div><hr />

two of the most exciting things in a few weeks!<br />
<br />
dual spec cheaper (so now its actually an option before you hit 80 lol) and the theorycraft thing looks sweet. Now people who are interested in their character can actually figure things out without graphs and charts from EJ. :)</div></div><hr />

Why? That's the WoW equivalent for demanding a refund on your car because the prices are lowered the year after you bought it.<br />
<br />
Also; See that bag on top of the servers in the third picture? That's filled with human fat, commonly used by Boub to lubricate the servers for smoother service.</div></div><hr />

I'm just pointing out how much better the old version was, in both gameplay and lore.<br />

I can guarantee you will be the first person to bitch when running around looking for the shattered staff pieces on launch if something doesnt change...<br />

It took me nearly an hour to find all 8 pieces with my eyeballs straining from their sockets.<br />

<br />
Back when TBC was coming out we had what 3-4 battlegroups? Blizzard bought just over 1k HP servers to upgrade the data centers so yes Wow is run by more than handful of servers. We have more battlegroups and 2 expansions later. There's hundreds per battlegroup for redundancy and processing power.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, with the change in glyphs being &quot;learned&quot; into a &quot;spellbook&quot; where you can switch them in and out anytime you want, respecing should be cake and honestly, cheap. Especially if you use an addon to store your other spec (forget the name) it will end up being like 2 buttons to switch specs.</div></div><hr />

LOVE the new changes to char panel, will get rid of alot of the theorycrafting needed for 'am I capped in X stat', of course as they're removed Def and ArP, which were the two most commonly asked 'am I capped' stats, it does lessen it a bit, but still there for Hit and Exp, which is win.<br />

<br />
It's probably a subtle point, but the fact is that the bulk of what theorycrafters have been dissecting (most in vanilla, less so as time went on and certain factoids came out over time) was INFERRED theory, while the details that we're going to see in Cata are the ACTUAL numbers. I doubt there will be significant surprises, but there is a difference nonetheless.</div></div><hr />

Shiney new blade server(s)! :D<br />
I was expecting bigger ones, or rather, more of them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Those are not blades but 1U/2U HPs. The size doesn't matter in this case as the servers are only processing Db lookups to the disk shelves below that you can see. Really only local disks with the OS, CPU(s), and RAM.<br />
<br />
Blades are pretty easy to spot (large housing unit w/ blades (add in servers) mounted vertically).</div></div><hr />

Except hit isn't arbitrary or baseless... It's a valid method for gearing up for raiding that requires a little bit of thought for a raider. Now it's even better because the information on it is all in game and there's no need to go to an outside source. Sorry the need to gain enough hit is too complicated for you, but for the majority of us it's simple math and doesn't really require much thought at all to setup.</div></div><hr />

So does this mean that all the displays will actually take into account racials/talents now like expertise does today? As hit doesn't yet expertise does, which is inconsistent and a huge problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Steam related games like HL2 that use the source engine are all ways getting updated. HL2 is what 5 years old (or close to it), and they are all ways getting visual updates.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I assume so if you look at the pictures on the front page. Keep in mind though that racials are changing and it's very likely the extra expertise gained by them could very well go away completely.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beachcomber</div><div class="date">2010-08-27, 10:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a bit disappointed that it takes the developers so long to react to legitimate and reasonable concerns, like the cost of dual talent spec.<br />
<br />
At the time it came out, I recall very clearly saying in the WoW forums that there was no way a Level 40 player could afford dual talent spec unless he or she had a main that was funding it.<br />
<br />
And apparently, the people at Blizzard who play have a bottomless pit of gold they can use so they don't think twice about the cost of items like this and the epic flying mount (I only have epic flying on one of my toons, a druid).<br />
<br />
TL;DR I'm glad it's lower in cost but disappointed that they reasoned it away from being a lower cost when it first came out.</div></div><hr />

I was expecting bigger ones, or rather, more of them.<br />

Those are not blade servers.<br />

They are rack mount servers.<br />

Big difference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
when i bought my first 100% mount i paid 1000g for it. i did not complain when it went down to 50g.<br />
<br />
You buy a computer part. within a month its cheaper. do you get a refund ? No<br />
<br />
Live with it and be happy for when you make an alt</div></div><hr />

Sorry i just had to laugh hard at this. Try to level any profession from the AH. It takes less time but more gold<br />

About my first post, &quot;would be nice&quot; its an opinion, im not requiring such a refund. At least to me because i bought it for my 10 characters</div></div><hr />

We usually get a better deal on Dells but HP will keep your servers under maintenance longer, which can be very nice at keeping surprises at bay.<br />
<br />
They also have much better Unix/Linux support. Dell's are cheaper, but if you have Linux on your servers and call support you might as just speak Swahili for all the support guys will understand you.</div></div><hr />

About me, well, I want an Xp refund, because I leveled 2 chars during early vanilla, and then early BC and early wotlk. It was way more time consuming and I had to get more Xp, I want all of this back when Cata is out to get 1 or 2 free levels, 'cause I deserve it.<br />

Yup.<br />
