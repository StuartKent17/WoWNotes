That's low as well. 2k/4k would be nice. The weekly reduction handles it in a different way though so thats fine, but its not something you control.</div></div><hr />

Not overly fussed about the gold, but on that subject 700 is a bit of a joke. <br />
<br />
The AP should have been that much since day 1. As I said in other posts, being at a point where your next AP is 4 ranks away and you're grinding for 4 ranks it's not fun, it's not rewarding, it's something that never should have made it to live. <br />
<br />
Doesn't matter if it was 2 minutes,2 hours, 2 weeks, 2 months, 2 years, 20 years. Had an alpha, had a beta shouldn't have made it live</div></div><hr />

People crying over this stuff is my kink don't shame me. Lmao people are just unhappy individuals. No pleasing them in game or in life :'( Oh well. I'll enjoy the extra gold for sure. And the AP will help all 8 of my 120s</div></div><hr />

Because this game was ever in such a state where you didn't feel rewarded for menial tasks.<br />

<br />
Well you have to take into account that not every emmisary gives AP - some give gold, some give gear. How often do you see an AP Emmisary every week? Maybe twice at most, probably more likely once?</div></div><hr />

Don't like it don't do them. It has 0 impact on you or your game. Nobody should NEED the gold from these. It's a bonus. Again, 0 impact on you. Stop complaining just to complain.<br />
<br />
Without complaints nothing would change? Think about it, if the majority of us kept silent about the abomination of a system azerite is, then we wouldn't be having a new vendor implemented. <br />
<br />
Also thanks for correct the grammar in a online forum about warcraft, I was soooo worried about that<br />

Complaining, crying, and bashing the game don't get anything done. <br />
<br />
Constructive feedback and acting like an adult gets things done. Notice they add changes based on actual feedback? Vendors, caches, etc. were specifically mentioned by community members. It has nothing to do with people making posts like AZERITE SUCKS MOS 2.0. BFA KILLED WOW. Etc etc.<br />
<br />
Nobody knows why you're crying unless you say something. It's like kids throwing a fit in the middle of a store. Just doing it for the sake of doing it. Voice your opinions. Stop lashing out.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure I already said (and said in this post) why I dislike this expansion. But let me make it more clear<br />
<br />
1) Hitting a point where you need 4 levels up to gain a single trait isn't fun. A small ilvl and stat boost to the neck piece which isn't worth noting; isn't for sure worth calling a reward<br />
<br />
2) Going from the epic law we had in legion to pirates is a massive let down, we built momentum in legion and it's been lost. <br />
<br />
3) The azerite gear sucked, yes its been &quot;fixed&quot; to a degree, but that fix should of been in place from day one, not as a fix, but as a standard. <br />
<br />
4) The AP fix that came in tonight, should of been a fix from day one, again not a fix but standard. <br />
<br />
Maybe I should include these quick 4 reasons in my signature? I wasn't aware I had to justify my dislike for an expansion on every single post (multiple times).</div></div><hr />

I don't think people realise just how useful being self sufficient is. They all just think 'what should I get for gold?' rather than 'what should I take to save gold?' <br />

I took Alchemy and Engi on my main years ago when engineering was still giving buffs (and being a gnome there is no reason for me to change) and i made both a Herb/Mining tank as my 2nd 120 and then followed that up with an enchanter.

This. So much this.<br />
I started off as a jewelcrafter, and a guildmate told me to not be stupid and be an alchemist with my main if I was going to try and raid - even if raiding casually. It was the best piece of advice that someone gave me, as my gold spending is minimal (repairs and shit I don't wanna farm when I'm being a lazy fuck).<br />
Any change that gives me more gold for something I was gonna do anyway is welcome, and I'm glad I'm on my 4th toon at max lvl.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Sick Trick To Get Emissary Done In 5 Seconds! CRAZY!&quot;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thunderdragon2</div><div class="date">2018-10-26, 12:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well you have to take into account that not every emmisary gives AP - some give gold, some give gear. How often do you see an AP Emmisary every week? Maybe twice at most, probably more likely once?<br />
<br />
did you forget that every emmisery give a base reward of 400 ap+ the additional reward? or did you not look at what you were getting when you turned it in?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostyfire14</div><div class="date">2018-10-26, 12:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Such a welcome change. Thank you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The blizzard post largely implies that it only effects emissaries whos primary reward is AP or Gold.<br />
<br />
&quot;Emissary rewards of gold now provide 2000g up from 700g&quot; and &quot;Emissary rewards of AP now provide 1600 AP up from 1000 AP&quot;<br />
<br />
So this won't impact every emissary that gives 400.<br />
<br />
If your intention is to say that we have to include every single emissary quest's 400 ap plus the primary 1600 ap, then yea you'll get more AP from that then from the island expeditions - but it also takes more time; and that was still the case BEFORE this change. Doing every emissary would still get you more AP than the 2500 weekly from expeditions. (Even if you got zero AP emissaries, @ 400 AP each you already get 2800 a week)</div></div><hr />

<br />
so its not getting added to the base ap reward rip that could have done with a increase as i got really no incentive to do azerite/resource emmiseries on my main with a 360 a 370 and a 385 piece equipped</div></div><hr />

Based on what they said, no. If every single emissary gave 1600 ap, THAT would be absurd. That would bump the average weekly AP from ~ 5500-6000 to over 12k.</div></div><hr />

well no what i thought it meant was if the extra reward was ap it would get a total of 1600 if not you'd get 600-800 that was my interpretation</div></div><hr />

Why can't you take advantage of whistle + mount speed bonus from FP from ship upgrade, and doing kill x rare quest to do emissaries quickly? Lmao. I'm sorry your parents hurt you and you have trust issues. Just know not everyone has problems doing WQs efficiently and quickly.<br />

Did you know that while doing the &quot;Azerite Mining&quot; quests you can spam click the chunks to gather them twice? Gives 10-15% per gather on the big pillars, twice. You can do this WQ in like a minute lol.</div></div><hr />

You can have critiques of the game but you are one of several million players and trying to sift through the often confused opinions of millions is not worth an individual look when you are only paying 15 dollars a month.

I'm saying that Blizzard is not smart enough now to see what the game really needs and as such will not listen to even good advice from players. Since they seem more interested in Quarterly reports than quality of there service, they keep trying short term simple cash grabs such as the virtual ticket. It is going up to 50 dollars with a very limited vanilla experience as part of the bait but the extreme time limit on it shows either the malice of J. Allen Brack or just another clueless approach that ignores what made Vanilla such a special experience.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let's see, 12 characters doing gold-rewarding emissaries would be able to buy one of those frog mounts in about 14 emissaries. Yeesh.<br />
<br />
Not quite the million a month I was making from missions in Legion in the last few months, but still makes those things faaar more affordable, if I can stomach the tedium.<br />
<br />
12 chars x 4 WQ = min 1,5 hour. it nets you 24k .( you have to include travel time etc because no flying ) <br />
<br />
30 minutes of overtime in work equals minimum 20 euro unless you live in country with fucked up economy or are doin shitty job and nets you 180k , 1,5 hour equals to 540 k . <br />

ye so worth to do those WQ :0</div></div><hr />

I don't mind it. Far more engaging than daily quests. And it doesn't require you to go to the quest hub first and then out in the world. Also it doesn't take up spots in the quest log.</div></div><hr />

Due to them being already out in the world. So even if you are out in the world for other reasons, like farming. You can choose to do some WQs that are nearby that have rewards that you are interested in. Instead of daily quests which you go to with the intent of doing dailies. WQs design feels more open and free. And travel time and quest log is bonuses. <br />
<br />
What would you have then instead of WQs to grant daily objectives for reputation and other rewards?</div></div><hr />

Not sure what you are saying here. Does this mean you have no interest in the rewards themself and don't care about AP, Resouces, Rep etc. Or are you implying that the rewards should be given once you are max level just by completing the main story and have infinite war resources and exalted with everything? <br />
<br />
Sounds dull to me. Having long term low priority goals like reputation is quite fun.<br />

It's a streamlined version of daily quests, which have been in the game longer than you've probably been playing. It is not at all like Facebook because it's contributing to your character's progression, which you can use for higher end content.

<br />
Constructive feedback and acting like an adult gets things done. Notice they add changes based on actual feedback? Vendors, caches, etc. were specifically mentioned by community members. It has nothing to do with people making posts like AZERITE SUCKS MOS 2.0. BFA KILLED WOW. Etc etc.<br />
<br />
Nobody knows why you're crying unless you say something. It's like kids throwing a fit in the middle of a store. Just doing it for the sake of doing it. Voice your opinions. Stop lashing out.<br />
<br />
No offense, but you're 100% wrong. There are literally 1000s of pages of &quot;constructive feedback&quot; - an entire community saying the same thing, and it gets ignored for months - all the way through beta. They do not give a single shit about constructive feedback. And when people - again, en masse - tell them that something is bad, they double down on it and resist. Then the people get angry and screamy, and at that point, they quit. And THAT is the point where Blizz starts to give a shit.<br />
<br />
They care about what causes people to get so angry that they quit. Period.<br />
<br />
They know they made a dumpster fire and they're frantically trying to put it out. And they're still fucking up that attempt, but at least now we can see they're actually trying. <br />
<br />
I mean, how did anybody in their right mind look at mission table/emissary rewards and think &quot;yeah this is good; people will like this&quot;. Honestly. The fact that that went live is boggling because literally the very first second I saw it I was like &quot;welp, not wasting my time on this garbage&quot;. And obvs. thousands of other players felt exactly the same. And that's just one example of many glaring design errors.<br />

The fact that that went live is boggling because literally the very first second I saw it I was like &quot;welp, not wasting my time on this garbage&quot;. And obvs. thousands of other players felt exactly the same. And that's just one example of many glaring design errors.<br />

You're doing it wrong? I have over 2 million on my expired account. You can run a few gold WQs in no time at all each day and have more gold than you need. Or heck log in and send your followers on gold missions.<br />
<br />
Sounds to me you don't have time to raid, if you don't have time to famr gold/mats/etc. Don't you have an herbalist? A guild with an alchemist?<br />
<br />
Probably not... guilds aren't much a thing anymore since &quot;serious raiders&quot; are those who logs in and joins a groupfinder.<br />
<br />
They probably should just do away with flasks/pots for convenience... I mean doing anything outside of raiding is ridiculous in an MMO.. amirite?</div></div><hr />

Since you haven't played in BFA - you aren't getting it. You keep saying expired - so stop talking out your ass. BFA isn't like the last two expansions when it comes to getting tons of gold for doing that stuff.<br />
<br />
No, you can't send your followers on gold missions anymore. They nerfed it and took away the old quests too. When BFA Launched. Now there are a few gold missions a week (maybe) and, let's see, last night the oe I saw was for 80 gold. <br />
<br />
No you can't just &quot;do a few WQ and have more gold than you need.&quot; Most of the WQ don't give gold rewards at all. Only certain ones each week and not very much even then.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are pages and pages on this forum of people talking about the gold sinks this expansion without a way to keep the incoming income &quot;back up where it use to be.&quot; In addition, mats are more expensive because Feasts/Flasks etc. take more of them including more rare/BOP mats as well.<br />
<br />
Yea it maybe good they are trying to reset the ENTIRE system from the last 10 years, but what use to work to &quot;make more gold than you need&quot; does not when it comes to mission tables and WQ etc.<br />
<br />
So try again Mr. Expired Account. Its why a lot of people don't like the BFA reward systems, because all the good rewards for stupid, mindless, grinding - were nerfed. And the RNG on equipment got worse.<br />
<br />
It is Not The Same as when you quit. We wish it was. Cuz yea, then it would be easier.<br />
<br />
Yes you can still gather mats. Yes you can play the AH (if your server isn't already over controlled by other players). <br />
<br />
But no you can't run a few WQ and send out your followers and sit back and rake it in. Well, at least not if you spend it at all. 100-200 gold x3 times a week (maybe) isn't raking anything in.</div></div><hr />

OMG... really? Look at Wowhead... single herbs and ore selling for 20-40g... Spend an hour a week and easily cover your raiding costs. Do old raids no longer net about 700-1000g for about 20 minus of playtime? The amount of QQ about not being able to make gold is ridiculous.<br />
<br />
And if previous expansions were sol lucrative, why in the world don't you have hundreds of g or millions of gold like me?<br />
<br />
Because you want to log in and raid, then log out. I wanted to play an MMO and have multiple toons, multiple proffs, sell things on the AH, etc.<br />
<br />
Which is WHY Classic will do so well. For players like me. For players like yourself, I guess your screwed either way then.. because spending an hour a week can EASILY cover your raid costs... but I guess that is asking too much from a modern MMO.</div></div><hr />

Yeah. sorry. You took two of the options I gave the guy who raids only and shot them down... but even then WQs that give gear, the gear vendors for like 50-100g.<br />
<br />
Point is... If you raid... there are plenty of ways to grind gold out to pay for raiding. If the complaint is &quot;it's too expensive&quot;, or &quot;it takes too much time&quot;... then either you don't have the time to raid because raiding ISN'T just logging in and going into the instance... or maybe MMOs just aren't for you. Everyone just expects to be handed everything in the game including gold. Blizz has catered again and again to the point that people like myself that WANT to play an MMO have no reason play because it's all given to you.<br />
<br />
At the VERY least... if flasks are $2500g... man... maybe drop your professions and pickup herbing and alchemy... it has never been EASIER to do in game... heck you don't even have to level from 0 anymore... just start leveling your BfA herbing.<br />
<br />
In a little bit of time, you can be making your own flasks/pots... and sell your OWN $2500 flasks. THAT is what an MMORPG is.</div></div><hr />

We had this same conversation at the beginning of legion. Order hall and WQ gold amounts were nowhere near as big at the start as they ended up. The gold output at the beginning of an expansion almost always ratchets back from the end of the previous and the base systems in the latest expansions have made this even sharper because you lose your alt list of fully upgraded garrisons/order halls etc. in addition to the natural cut back of gold rewards in game. <br />
<br />
The issue is that the player economy doesn't. Many people are still sitting on tons of legion gold so AH prices for things, especially raid consumables, didn't shift downward for the most part to reflect the lower output. At some point either the market will readjust as players stop having the gold to pay legion prices or natural uptick in gold output across the expansion catches back up.</div></div><hr />

You know what I find the most silly all of this, is that these posters are like what end 20? If they play for example since vanilla, nothing better to do than complaining about a game what 'they don't play anymore'.<br />

Yes I complain about complainers to make this fanwebsite fun again, that is a fact compare that people don't like BfA because they are burned out or they don't wanna miss out on content because they are addicted and put a lot of time in their chars.<br />

<br />
i have an alchemist. Farming 1 flask takes about 15mins of farming. i got 11 flasks out of 8 build. Wow. it's very time consuming<br />
Follower gold missions? 4h for a 70g mission lol. There aren't fat gold missions anymore... WQs: 70-90g missions, about 5-6 per day, makes less than 600g a day. I use 12 flasks per week (raids and mythic), costs about 30000g. Compared to 3000g a week with WQs and missions...guy...<br />
<br />
I could farm the shit but it's a waste of time in my opinion. I play the game for fun...i'm happy that some emissary quests now give 2k ; i can do them on 3 chars.<br />
<br />
I never got a random epic item i could sell, except for 350 hands nobody wants, not even for 20k. I get some enchants for free which i'm very happy. I also give mats to the guild bank to build banquets, i could also sell those mats for 3k, but i'm a guildmate who takes and gives equally.<br />
it was easier in legion. Blizzard wants to drop the amount of gold ingame, but the only gold that drops is the one of people that don't have a lot and not those who farmed 2millions during draenor</div></div><hr />

<br />
First, you say farming 1 flask takes 15 mins. That's 4 per hour with no procs. So 3 hours a week is too much time to farm?<br />
<br />
What if you took a couple days and farmed for 2 hours each? That would get you 16 flasks... keep 12 to raid with and sell 4 for 10k that week. You have plenty of opportunity to make flasks and earn gold.<br />
<br />
And why exactly isn't your guild supplying flasks? If everyone is giving to the guild, it should be rich enough to mass produce flasks for raid.<br />
<br />
I'll tell you why. People don' want to play the game.. they just want to raid. To play the game 4 hours a week to farm mats &quot;isn't fun&quot;. But it's part of an MMORPG. In the fantasy world, your character has to prepare for the raids... he doesn't sit around and sunbathe on the beaches of Tanaris until raid night.<br />
<br />
If you don't want to play in order to gain power for your character, why raid? Why play the game at all? I used to LOVE to sit in ventrillo and chat with guildies while I flew around and mined, herbed, etc. It was a relaxing time to bullshit and farm mats.</div></div><hr />

I think the above statement is true, and what got them to change their minds.<br />
<br />
I did unsub as soon it was clear that Bfa is more or less just a copy/paste of the last couple of expansions.<br />
<br />
For some odd reason people believe nice graphics is new content ..i..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just like your claim of 13 mil subs in Legion, every other claim is just unfounded guessworks. I mean...Blizzard doesn't even release box-sales beyond what sold in the first week.<br />
<br />
So, we all happily claim what we find in the deepest places of our behinds......<br />
<br />
(but now you made me curious where the 13 million comes from...and no, Jaylock is not a source)</div></div><hr />

There is no possible way to fail them or die doing them and they can be done in a couple minutes. Why should you get anything but a pittance?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I played the game since Vanilla beta, its not easy to just up and completely quit like that. However, the general direction of the game is not appealing to me. Eventually, returning to forums surrounding WoW, will fade away just the same as playing the game. <br />
<br />
I doubt I'm the only one who's unsubscribed, who still harbors regret and uncertainty. Sure, its easy to make fun of the &quot;Unsub people&quot; Who are all bark and no bite, but as things stands... I think I'll be saying permanently goodbye to the game at this point. I've found much more enjoyable story / Gameplay in another MMO: Final Fantasy XIV, I have other games to play; League of Legends, Red Dead Redemption 2, Monster Hunter World, Slay the spire... Amongst many others, and I find myself peeking around for change less and less.</div></div><hr />

<br />
question is do they want ppls to log in and do activities? if yes then rewards have to be worth enough to get ppls into doing them, no matter how long it take and how much effort it require. <br />
I can speak only for myself but doing world quests is not to passionate activity, if you take in consideration that i main enh shaman and i don`t want/like playing alts that much, there is no really any reasons to log in beside raids and some PvP at this point.</div></div><hr />
