The effects of the Cataclysm on Outland<br />
Just because Azeroth is being affected doesn't mean the threat of the Burning Legion isn't still there (for new toons to experience at least). If anything changes in this regard it would probably be a couple quests that send you there but I wouldn't expect Outland itself to change much since messing with 2 continents is already a lot of work. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/19820526504-cataclysm-to-outland-to-cataclysm.html))<br />
<br />
[...] You have to consider the changes with some form of leniency, while technically you could say that if the story progresses then we need to remove a bunch of the content from Outland and Northrend as those are over - but for numerous reasons, you can probably see why that would be a bad idea. This is the same type of thing that happens by just having a persistent world, just because one quest was completed where something was killed doesn't mean it vanishes from your sight forever.<br />
<br />
While a level 80 doesn't need to return to the locations of Outland and Northrend and can focus on the new stories - a new character hasn't helped defeat the villains in those areas so they still need to answer the call and fight them off (or in the terms people are tossing around, they need to level).

Totem of Wrath / Demonic Pact<br />
We want to solve the discrepancy between ToW and DP before Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Demonology needs to be brought because it does competitive dps, not because it has an awesome buff. Or even better, you should want the Demo lock because the player playing it is someone you want to play with. Nobody should get brought because they have an awesome buff but are otherwise a liability. You should be able to get most of the buffs and debuffs you really need in a number of different raid configurations, and ideally even taking two players of the exact same spec won't feel like a mistake. The game should be in defeating the boss, not assembling the group. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19820635867-eledemo-pve-totem-of-wrath-in-322.html))</div></div><hr />

<br />
seriously, it's already impossible to get off rogue poisons... now they nerf cleansing totem, i just can't believe it. since i play a DK myself, i know it could be annoying sometimes, when all your diseases were getting dispelled by a totem spamming shaman... but it never ever crossed my mind to see it as overpowered. it's a PVP change, benefitting rogues and deathknights and hurting shamans... that's ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
(attention! heavy QQ incoming! here we go...)<br />
<br />
with the big difference, that retribution paladins were not dominating PVP at that time. death knights on the other hand, allthough they've been nerfed pretty hard, haven't had a problem with the totem for a few seasons now... why now?<br />
<br />
and &quot;completely nullify&quot; is just not true. i feel much more nullified by the chain-CC some classes are able to pull off... or melee-zerg-teams, who just keep on hitting their buttons until i'm gone, no matter what i do. <br />
<br />
since the totem always gets killed on sight, i'd say the only thing the change has nullified is the shamans ability to dispel death knight diseases efectively. they could just make every buff that's useful to some class in some way undispellable... they've done it with retribution paladins, mages, warlocks... if they don't want buffs/debuffs to be dispelled, why do they give some classes the ability to do so in the first place?<br />
<br />
before i forget... i always found that &quot;dispel over time&quot; priests have pretty annoying too... why don't they get nerfed?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If this is what Blizzard is trying to achieve. Should people playing other classes be expecting the buffs they bring to raids, to be more simplified in the future? (i.e. no more Imp Power Word: Fortitude or Imp Mark of the Wild)? will they be dumbed down to just one basic buff that a player can cast being ANY spec? <br />
Thats just sort of what it sounds like what they are saying when it is put like this &quot;Nobody should get brought because they have an awesome buff but are otherwise a liability. You should be able to get most of the buffs and debuffs you really need in a number of different raid configurations, and ideally even taking two players of the exact same spec won't feel like a mistake.

Get nerfed the first patch.<br />
DKs get 2 seasons of free frost wyrms.<br />
Paladins are working on their 3rd season of free frost wyrms right now.<br />
RMP has yet to need 1/10th as much skill as Ghostcrawler thinks it needs and will, once again, have close to 30% of the top 3v3 spots.<br />
<br />
Shaman can't do ANYTHING to rogues. Not enhancement. Not elemental. Not restoration. None of them. The changes this patch simply make shaman worse and worse against rogues. Can we seriously give other classes abilities that counter rogues? Maybe even put an internal cooldown on the application of non-instant and non-deadly poisons? Seriously.<br />
<br />
* Of the past 7 WoW tournaments, the most recent was one by Team eMazing Gaming running beastcleave, which is getting hammered this patch.<br />
* The one before that was Blizzcon, won by TSG, running DK/arms warrior/holy pally cleave, which was nerfed in 3.2 out of existence.<br />
* The five tournaments before that? RMP. Nerfs they received?<br />

<br />
Its not just pvp nerf. Being able to drop a totem right as everyone gets hit by a poison is pretty powerful. Also, it only cost 1 second GCD to use with the same mana cost as cure toxins/cleanse spirit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed it is quite powerful - for a totem that you get at level 38. However, it still is just a totem, and is primarily used in raids/dungeons. Dont like it? run away from it or destroy it. At the same time though, a resto shamans heals arent terribly effective, nor do they really have a defence ability to assist with any stuns/fears.</div></div><hr />

&quot;It's overpowered. Long-term we need some kind of overhaul to the dispel system so that you can free allies who get debuffed or CC'd but you aren't constantly losing important class abilities because of cheap, fast and sometimes pulsing dispels.<br />

I'm being vague because we haven't announced any 3.2.2 or 3.3 changes yet. Those won't be the overhaul I described, but we hope to do something.&quot;</div></div><hr />

That's what we need, more classes taking a step back from their minor struggle to be the next Paladin, and actually analysing how worse off other classes are to theirs. I myself have an 80 DK, Mage, Rogue, and shaman - Shammy being my main. I can see how other classes feel like they're getting messed up, but in all honesty - Shamans are being treated with little to no love what so ever. I would almost not be suprised seeing patch 3.2.3 nerfing a shamans once again. (INC Shaman run speed too fast - Shamans will now have to make their way around Azeroth in a wheel chair.)</div></div><hr />

No one is &quot;QQ&quot;ing. You need the learn the difference between QQing and having an actual intelligent argument, but that's probably beyond your capacity.<br />
<br />
I think Shaman do need some buffs in some areas, but being able to nullify a class by simply throwing something on the ground is just kind of stupid. Anyone with half a brain can see that. This isn't Season 5. DKs aren't the unkillable massive burst machines they were.<br />

I'm being vague because we haven't announced any 3.2.2 or 3.3 changes yet. Those won't be the overhaul I described, but we hope to do something.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So, the top 100 teams across the board set the standards for nerfing classes, not the millions of other folks that play?<br />
<br />
My 5-man groups will be disappointed when I struggle to keep up with cleansing in heroics.<br />

Does it seem to anyone else that Blizz seem to want to gradually, painfully remove shamans from existing in WoW? i mean, 3.2.2 will be stopping ele/enhance shamans from Thunderstorm/Shamanistic Rage while stunned (our only &quot;Real&quot; defence from any class) <br />

<br />
Removing the instant pulse from cleansing totem, fine, but compansate for it then............<br />
<br />
Maybe it was needed to nerf our (note, once again, restoshamans) survivability against DKs in arena or pvp in general. But this also nerfs us compared to rogues, who are probably the ones thats been on top of the foodchain since before arena even existed in-game.... <br />
<br />
COMPENSATION, make up for what you did to us by either giving us some anti-rogue abilities, or bringing down those rogues to a level-headed state.... I've yet to see a serious rogue nerf since mutilate was nerfed a little, and before that? i cant remember any there either...<br />
<br />
Then, give demo warlocks our ele buff, well, can you make up for it by bringing ele shamans on-par with the rest of the dps classes then? <br />
<br />
We scale horribly when it comes to cutting edge dps fights. Yes, we are fine in VoA pugs, naxx runs, ulduar normal runs, toc normal runs, Hodir hard mode. But when it comes to heroic mode/all the other hard modes, and everyone are skilled players maxing out their dps, we just stay down there, a 1000 or so dps below, with no light in the end of the tunnel. <br />

Why would guilds bring an ele shaman to those fights now that they can bring a demo lock instead?<br />

DK burst relying on diseases is DK's problem which is caused by Blizzard killing the disease-free playstyle. It is none of shaman's problem, really. <br />
<br />
Honestly, I think it would be much better if they found some other way to balance their beloved DK's then forcing them to use diseases and THEN nerfing some one else's inherited class ability. Then again, DKs can spread disease in AoE style, do have dispel resistance for their diseases - and currently there is no way to counter massive disease AoE at the point they nerfed cleansing totem. Sure, diseases may be weak - but that's just another thing you can't do anything about. Like cc, overwhelming burst, escape-ability etc. <br />
<br />
FoK rogues are overpowered, and I mean it. They can mind-numb healer and MS anyone caught within - with no reliable way to counter it. Together with disease spreading DK they can make your healer cry and no way that is somewhat balanced. How came that spammable AoE DoT-ing and screwing people is balanced and AoE dispel is broken?</div></div><hr />

And those attacks would immediately break sap and incapacitate, allowing you to Thunderstorm/Rage. What is the issue there?<br />
The CC itself is a deterrent for toons to attack you because attacking you WILL BREAK IT - even pve mobs are smart enough to drop aggro on an incapacitated target.</div></div><hr />

Totem of Wrath / Demonic Pact<br />
We want to solve the discrepancy between ToW and DP before Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Demonology needs to be brought because it does competitive dps, not because it has an awesome buff. Or even better, you should want the Demo lock because the player playing it is someone you want to play with. Nobody should get brought because they have an awesome buff but are otherwise a liability. You should be able to get most of the buffs and debuffs you really need in a number of different raid configurations, and ideally even taking two players of the exact same spec won't feel like a mistake. The game should be in defeating the boss, not assembling the group.<br />
<br />
Let ToW scale with spellpower. Give Bloodlust / Heroism to another class. Let pets scale with crit and haste. Tadaa no &quot;obligated need&quot; for a shaman in every raid or demon lock in 25-mans and Demon Locks will be playued again because they're competitive and not just because of the buffs.</div></div><hr />

you either do not know the dk class or your just a complete moron diseases do not make or break any dk spec yes they are useful and yes the boost our damage but it doesnt completely nullify anything when they are dispelled not to mention any pvp dk worth his salt has virulence which will decrease the likeliness of said dispells even without diseases as i stated i crit for 6k plus on 8-900 resil opponents and yes ive proven this the real power behind FS and SS is the fact that they IGNORE ARMOR due to them being a magical type of damage (FS=frost and SS = shadow) this makes them devastating to all opponent plate wearers or cloth esspecially when you have a high str/ap rating pushing them along with a higher end weapon if you are having problems due to disease dispells check your spec and upgrade your gear its that simple</div></div><hr />

The fact that I play both a lvl 80 DK and Shaman in arena at 2k rating should justify my response and be enough for me to have my facts straight.

<br />
With that said, the negation of the extra damage gained from diseases by totems has been bantered back and forth enough as it is. That's an obvious point. The main thing that bothered me about the miniscule cost of the Cleansing Totem compared to the cost of one to two runes for constant reapplication was skewed very heavily in the Shaman's favor. A lesser, but equally important, point would be that a moderately deep talent like Chillblains is completely negated by a cheap baseline ability at the same time.<br />
<br />
Those two points are where the mechanical imbalance lies.<br />
It has nothing to do with player skill.</div></div><hr />

Just because Azeroth is being affected doesn't mean the threat of the Burning Legion isn't still there (for new toons to experience at least). If anything changes in this regard it would probably be a couple quests that send you there but I wouldn't expect Outland itself to change much since messing with 2 continents is already a lot of work. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/19820526504-cataclysm-to-outland-to-cataclysm.html))<br />
<br />
[...] You have to consider the changes with some form of leniency, while technically you could say that if the story progresses then we need to remove a bunch of the content from Outland and Northrend as those are over - but for numerous reasons, you can probably see why that would be a bad idea. This is the same type of thing that happens by just having a persistent world, just because one quest was completed where something was killed doesn't mean it vanishes from your sight forever.<br />
<br />
While a level 80 doesn't need to return to the locations of Outland and Northrend and can focus on the new stories - a new character hasn't helped defeat the villains in those areas so they still need to answer the call and fight them off (or in the terms people are tossing around, they need to level). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/19820526504-cataclysm-to-outland-to-cataclysm.html))<br />
<br />
<br />
Does this mean they are going to revamp Outland content a bit?<br />
I think they should scale down all the raids to 5 man lv 68 instance since the 70 raid are never going to be raided again. And this could provide more content with no work at all. Also a lot of people who didnt experience the old raids could do thema again with this strategy (obviously there is still a 25 man raid of that instance for people who want to get the warglaives and all that stuff...)<br />
<br />
This or they should totally revamp the dungeons: normal version is for lvl 60-70 players, heroic version is for lvl 85 players. All Raids gets a lvl85 5man and 10man revamp. (5 man gets lvl85 low level epics, 10man gets high level epics).<br />
This would increase incredibly the content aviable for lvl85 players and also increase the heroics that are &quot;farmable&quot; for badges.<br />
Also they should add tabards for factions like WoTLK factions have. You know, revamping Outlands isnt always bad, since Northrend are &quot;fresh&quot; and the Azeroth is getting a full revamp, Outlands should get one too!</div></div><hr />

Thats just sort of what it sounds like what they are saying when it is put like this &quot;Nobody should get brought because they have an awesome buff but are otherwise a liability.

Well that is kind of the way they are going with the new leatherworking drums and inscription scrolls that will provide something like the benefit of Blessing of Kings, MOTW etc. But by that logic, I guess we should be expecting to see other class(es) aside from shamans get a heroism/bloodlust buff too.

<br />
<br />
<br />
You're the one who feels the need to result to insults without reason, and &quot;I&quot; am the immature one? Okay. <br />
<br />
Let me ask you something. When was your DK in the 2k rating? Right now in this season, or in the last season?<br />
<br />
Also, what do you mean how &quot;often&quot; DKs reapply their diseases? They don't. They're not going to Icy Touch / Chains of Ice + Plague Strike when they could be using Scourge Strike, Obliterate, Hungering Cold, or Death Strike. <br />
<br />
I'm still not sure why you feel the need to attack me. I don't want your attack nerfed into the ground. The fact is DKs were nerfed a lot since last season and honestly.. you don't need any sort of extra defense against them. You need them against classes that have been OP since day 1 of Vanilla WoW - Rogues (among others). <br />
<br />
Also to the other guy.. what do you mean DKs specs don't rely on diseases to do damage? Are you kidding me? Unholy is of course the most reliant and is absolutely crippled without them. Not only does Scourge Strike get its damage increased per disease on the target, it also gets its damage increased from things like Rage of Rivendare (% of damage for simply having Blood Plague on the target) and from the Ebon Plague disease (13% increased magic damage). It's the most horrible ability available if you don't have some diseases running. <br />
<br />
Frost, on the other hand, is more-so reliant on just having Frost Fever on the target as opposed to both diseases (but both are better). Frost Fever is a bit easier to apply since it has 2 ways to be applied if spec'd properly, both which are ranged (Chains of Ice / Icy Touch ).</div></div><hr />

And to destro locks saying shamans are OP: WTF?!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We had our time in vanilla WoW. Apparently we're not allowed to have fun any longer...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shiffer</div><div class="date">2009-09-16, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does it seem to anyone else that Blizz seem to want to gradually, painfully remove shamans from existing in WoW? i mean, 3.2.2 will be stopping ele/enhance shamans from Thunderstorm/Shamanistic Rage while stunned (our only &quot;Real&quot; defence from any class) and now this. Also, not sure of the changes that are in the works at the moment with ToW, but that will no doubt be put outside to die slowly....<br />
Before I see any more QQ-ing about how shamans need nerfs for any apparent reason, I want you to ask yourself one simple question...... &quot;Have Shamans ever been a threat to me whilst playing in BC or WotLK?&quot;<br />
<br />
just look at this QQing your doing. About nerf TO A CLEANSING TOTEM! what do you think that us deathknight feel when we get 10 nerfs every minor patch. having dancing rune weapon nerfed, having frost tanking and even dps and burst in terms of pvp really nerfed. QQing over one nerf although i know its a big one its not like shamans are gonna get slaughtered with this nerf.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shiffer</div><div class="date">2009-09-16, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">your wrong im running around in deadly with betrayer of humanity and even without diseases im critting people for over 6k when they have 8-900resil thats not wet noodle if i get a class out of los of their healer within 10 seconds they are dead end of story not to mention UH is the spec of choice for pvp which relies heavily on SS and glyph of SS which gives a chance to apply all of your diseases on the target to be honest if anything shammies need a buff not a nerf i see a shammy right now and its like ooo free kill with or without diseases on target <br />
<br />
6k crits on 900 resi? looks to me like awsome spec, or is it just uber lieng? give me your armory link and ill actually believe that, or make a video</div></div><hr />

Cleansing Totem: No longer pulses instantly when dropped. <br />
<br />
<br />
i hope this is a joke.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shiffer</div><div class="date">2009-09-16, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i know this thread is not about this but blizz... pay atention! ghostcrawler said cleansing totem was just op. it is. but then look at pally bubble!! imune to any harm for 12 seconds!! while you try nerfing other weak classes your just buffing paladins, i mean ret pallys, 8k divine storm hitting 4 enemies, getting 25% mana evry few secs, just op, and then buble its just unfair.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nixia</div><div class="date">2009-09-16, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We are talking about arena right?<br />
Then how the **** can you say warlocks are op? Our burst is OP i give you that, but our survival is crap so it evens out. I would be glad if they took some burst and gave us survival insted....<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway. Shamans whine about warlocks in arena? Shamans whine about rogues in arena?<br />
Like 99% of all warlocks and shamsn play RLS so shouldn't we be on the same side?<br />
<br />
And don't give me crap like &quot;we talk duel/bg&quot;, The game isn't balanced around that.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Punkenjoy</div><div class="date">2009-09-16, 09:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">anyway, this is pure QQ<br />
<br />
they said &quot; Rogue are never nerfed&quot; when we got nerfed every single patch since WoTLK was release. we were also a lot nerfed in TBC (nerfed hemo, nerfed cheat death etc..)<br />
<br />
Why rogue will stun you to death?<br />
<br />
1) Because you have 0 resilience<br />
2) you are noob<br />
3) the rogue is a lot more geared/skilled than you<br />
<br />
<br />
if its 1, Learn to resilience please. Even rogue have to get resilience, if you want to pvp, raise your resilience...<br />
<br />
if its 2, learn 2 play<br />
<br />
if its 3, why its not normal than someone with more skill/gear kill you? a well geared shaman in pvp will survive trought the 2 stunt of the rogue most of the time. it's sure that if the rogue stunt you, and the other DPS is focusing on you you will die. But every class will die. Not only shaman. Also there is a lot of other combo like that doesn't involve rogue....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Shaman are not underpowerd. Elemental can nuke a target realy fast, tanks to the 3 sec cooldown on shock and 100% crit chance on lava burst. Since they can nuke a lot, it's normal they can be nuked fast.<br />
<br />
Same with Warlock. They nuke hard, but die fast. Rogue can be easily killed. they don't nuke that hard like shaman and lock (realy, its look like we nuke hard, but its just because you are stunned) but got more CC. (dont think because we are able to top the DPS meter in raid that we can do the same in BG/arena, its different spec and the cookie cutter mutilate spec do a lot less DPS that the raid version of the spec). Also, substain DPS =/= Nuke<br />
<br />
<br />
Imho, class that are OP are the one who wear plate, can survive in arena with 600 or less resilience because anyway, they got 30k HP and a lot of physical damage mitigation. they can attack multiple target at the same time<br />
<br />
its why each team with a rogue that are successfull do not imply another melee. You will just die everytime you will face multiple plate team. They will destroy both melee too fast. (if only we could have the same buff that faction champion have 75% less damage from aoe)<br />
<br />
next patch rogue are still nerfed. They nurf our only aoe by 30%. <br />
<br />
caster will find that rogue are OP, Warrior, Ret and DK don't. if half the class think you are OP and the half other don't do you are OP?<br />
<br />
so, this is only pure QQ. <br />
<br />
Cry little shaman ! CRY! !!!! <br />
<br />
you will still be viable in pvp since Bloodlust + FS, LvB + FS combo, + tremor + Spirit wolf/Tunderstorm are all very effective skill in BG.<br />
<br />
If you don't perform well, you are the problem</div></div><hr />
