<br />
They take away Bust of Speed with Legion but compensate with the 30 second sprint cooldown. Okay, it's not quite the same but that's cool. NOPE - Sprint back to 1 minute cooldown now. Burst of Speed still gone.<br />
<br />
And also the Improved Feint nerf. A talent we've had since the MoP talent rework. Apparently it needs the entire reason anyone ever took it (for better survivability against AoE's) to be taken away.</div></div><hr />

At first it was like welfare legendary, everybody gets equal chance! hence casuals like it. but now more difficulty guarantees more drop rate? and who cares if they lock the effects of it for the few weeks, hardcore raiders will farm the shit out of it - probably doing high challenge modes and they will get on track like they always did. to them those changes doesn't matter because they will get it anyway, but now for the casual/global raid goers the hell begins. Because hardcore users have already farmed items and cleared raids now they will have higher standards on gear for the pug (ex: 1 pc legendary req). and now what? to acquire legendary items you need a legendary. otherwise farm the murlocs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You need to adjust your interpretation of what Legendaries are going to be. Have you played Diablo 3? I know it's been said before, but the Loot system in Reaper of Souls makes for interesting Builds... remember Builds? I'm guessing that is where Blizzard is trying to take Legion -one more step from the Cookie Cutter builds to something more evolved.<br />
<br />
I can't imagine the tuning and balancing involved, and I'm sure there will be OP Legendaries out there -but then that's part of the game, farming and RNG -ultimately it should lead to more diversity which has to be encouraged.<br />
<br />
The balance of the above, however, is what will deserve the applause -but we should definitely welcome Blizz aiming for diversity.</div></div><hr />

Because it'd never occur to Blizz to simply roll that damage bonus into the other skills, no. They're just going to create a spec that's 30% behind in damage because Arvandor logic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Legendaries in Legion will come in the form of multiple different item slots with a special ability enhancement (or providing) bonus attached to it. Each class will have multiple but they will be rare.<br />
<br />
What they are saying is that you can only use 1 legion legendary initially if you get it. If you somehow get lucky enough to have more, you can switch between whats useful for your build and whatever you're doing at the time. Later in the expansion you can equip more in your slots.</div></div><hr />
