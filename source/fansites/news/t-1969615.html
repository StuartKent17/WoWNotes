True Aim triggers on Arcane Shot but not on Sidewinders?<br />
We will change this to apply to your primary target with Sidewinders as well. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/710629309375885312))<br />
<br />
Do all Hunters share the same Marked for Death debuff on a target?<br />
Nope. This debuff is individual per Hunter. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/710633162125107201))<br />

Living Bomb not spreadable with Inferno blast<br />
We’re working on a slightly different idea for how LB spreads... Have you tried Kael’thas’ Chain Bomb? (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/710632883791069184))<br />
<br />
Whats behind making Blink a totally useless ability?<br />
Assuming you’re talking about the stun break—this is a tooltip error. The stun break has not been changed. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/710643065468297216))<br />
<br />
Good to know, I'm assuming Shimmer doesn't break stuns then? Would be pretty ridiculous in PvP if it did.<br />
This is correct; Shimmer does not break stuns. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/710894992026259456))<br />

Final Verdict also increases the damage on Blade of Vengeance by 20%. Seems to be a bug, right?<br />
A bug, indeed. We'll get this fixed, thanks! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/710629439629975552))<br />

Pets and Pet Battles<br />
Umm, is Screeching gears supposed to stun 5x in a row?Frog Kiss 4x in a row,thought the debuff prevented that? #Clueless<br />
the debuff doesn't kick in until the stun wears off, allowing for stun-lengthening combos, both have gotten a nerf in Legion (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/710661332740145156))<br />
the chance at being stunned 5x in a row currently is less than 0.1% though that is some supreme RNG unluck (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/710661485291134976))<br />

It's also a CC breaker and an extension of your toolkit -you're an unstoppable Death Knight, not a Monk or Demon Hunter -the ability is pretty cool when you take it into the context of your class; it's also like I said, a nice extension to your toolkit. <br />
<br />
As for pacifying your DK, well the tooltip says you can't attack but maybe you can still use other abilities? <br />
<br />
As for credits -well we're probably looking at the team that came up with Leoric's Wraith Walk from Heroes of the Storm -which in use is pretty cool! So maybe the DK's version will grow on you. Certainly in context, DK Wraith Walk is a positive to our toolkit!</div></div><hr />

Ok take away the &quot;We Love Blizzard&quot; goggles for a second and look at this properly.<br />
<br />
They removed Deaths Advance because we were supposed to be an immobile juggernaut in line with their new tagline &quot;Fantasy&quot;.<br />
<br />
They gave us a movement speed cooldown that is in every single way, worse than Deaths Advance and said &quot;Hey we listened&quot;.<br />
<br />
Then, for Unholy, they gave them a talent that essentially makes its Deaths Advance again - throwing &quot;fantasy&quot; in the wind.<br />
<br />
For Frost, theyve also given them a talent, albeit not as good.<br />
<br />
Blood has nothing. The spec that arguably needs it most, still has a movement speed cooldown which has a short duration, long cooldown and pacifies you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you can use other abilities&quot;.<br />
<br />
Which other abilities would they be? Tanks have had their AM cut considerably so while yes we CAN use defensives, we dont really have many anymore and you certainly will be thinking twice before using them, so if we cannot Death Strike. Whats the point?<br />
<br />
Wraith Walk, is in EVERY. SINGLE. WAY. Inferior to what we had. Yes it may look cool, oohh ahh we got Leoric Wraith Walk. Its still shit.</div></div><hr />

Honestly they should give blood an aura that slows everything else down by like 10% within a certain radius around , like 15-25 yards and bam, everything else gets slower around us and then we don't have to click anything.</div></div><hr />
