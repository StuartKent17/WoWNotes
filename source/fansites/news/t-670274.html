Recent In-Game Fixes - September 2009 - 9/23/09<br />
Listed below are recent fixes we have applied to the game. Keep in mind that some of these changes may not be active until after the realm has been restarted. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/23/19820412001-recent-ingame-fixes--september-2009--98.html))<br />
<br />
09/23/09<br />
The Val'kyr Twins will now heal for more in Heroic difficulties and ignore any heal dampening effects.<br />
Koralon now pauses after casting Blazing Embers before casting Burning Breath.<br />
Reclaimed Thunderstrike and Reinforced Thunderstrike will now properly grant attack power to druids in Cat Form, Bear Form, and Dire Bear Form as listed in the item tooltip.<br />
<br />
<br />
Experience gains in Battlegrounds Increased<br />
The reduced experience in Alterac Valley is due to the fact that Battleground experience is based off of the level of the Battleground. Characters level 70-79 are no longer getting experience based on level 80 characters. As a result of this, we are now able to do an across-the-board increase to experience gains from all Battlegrounds in order to make sure that no Battleground feels too unrewarding in terms of experience. We have also made it so the experience bonus from heirloom items works properly in Battlegrounds.

Blue posts<br />
Paid race change<br />
More information will be provided on this upcoming service when we are closer to launching it. Hang tight, it's not far off. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/20133923682-paid-race-change--need-blizzard-rep.html))<br />
<br />
AP Debuff in raids and important buffs/debuffs (Reminder: Raidcomp (http://raidcomp.mmo-champion.com/)!)<br />
The original concern was for a 10-player group. We don't assume an AP debuff for a 10-player raid, though it is certainly nice to have. We assume you have it in a 25-player raid. We make some assumptions about the most important buffs and debuffs for larger raids, particularly those trying the heroic / hard mode content. Those include things like Replenishment, Fort, Kings, Gift, Bloodlust / Heroism, CoE, the AP debuff, Sunder Armor, the attack speed debuff, and maybe Scorch and a few others. Even in those cases you don't need every buff / debuff the game offers and even if you're missing one of the big ones, you can overcome that with enough skill (or gear). The bosses don't do an instant berserk if they detect you are missing Demo Shout. Yes, it will be harder without. Hard modes are for guilds capable of doing hard modes. Normal modes are for almost everyone.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, Demo Shout isn't hard to get. No, you can't just randomly assemble any 10 characters and have a strong raid comp. But you certainly have a lot more flexibility in how you assemble your groups than in the BC content, and the proof of that is in the enormous diversity of raids that are beating the encounters. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/19820640986-wtb-ap-debuff-so-i-can-do-my-job.html))<br />

Questlines related to Varimathras completable again in 3.3<br />
A bronze whelp delivers the following note, which certainly doesn't seem to be in Sylvanas' hand:<br />
<br />
Deathhorne, You're right. Someone has to fill the void and take care of business. I'll take that scroll from you when I get to my post.<br />
<br />
- B<br />
<br />
There's no further signature, but oddly, it seems to be dated &quot;3.3&quot;... (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/14/19820328307-dear-lady-sylvanas.html))<br />
<br />
Ram Racing reset changes to 18 hours<br />
I'm just popping in to confirm this resets every 18 hours, not 12 as has been the case in previous years. [...] It's every 18 hours from when you last did it, and no, there's no place to check when your time will be up. <br />
<br />
[...] The idea is it's meant to be done once a day. The 18 hour reset is there so the time is more flexible for people who might do it later one day and earlier the next, as opposed to, say, a 23 hour reset which would be a significant detriment to those with limited but inconsistent time to play.

Shadow Priests<br />
In the case of Shadow priests, we thought damage was a little low and made a very small adjustment. Many Shadow priests think their dps is still unacceptably low, but we don't agree. (That also doesn't mean we won't make changes in the future. We do change our minds.) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19820641443-browsed-a-few-topics-not-impressed.html))<br />

God damn it blizzard...How is it fair that mages can faceroll 2 buttons (3.2.2 arcane spam) and do at least 1k more dps than I do with similar gear when I have to press at least 6 buttons...<br />
<br />
I guess a better example is feral druids, they are near the top of meters I assumed this is because they are very difficult to play (not assuming facemauler or easymode addons), why don't shadow priests get the same treatment?</div></div><hr />

Youre just like me, i really dont care about the US vs EU thing but how come so many US guilds get this achievements....maybe US guilds started to get money to play? Or did the social system in the US get better.<br />

<br />
<br />
Rogues are top of the PvE dps in most encounters, but you said let's not talk about that, so we will casually brush it to one side. <br />
<br />
Let's talk about PvP - <br />
An infinite cycle of crowd control - <br />
<br />
Sap<br />
Stun<br />
Stun<br />
Gouge<br />
Blind<br />
Vanish<br />
Repeat<br />
<br />
If it all goes wrong you can vanish (wooops, lol, when it works) and repeat the above. Lets not mention how you can totally lock any caster down, PLUS have reduction in cast speed whilst providing the highest burst dps of any class AND having mortal strike effect ROFL.<br />
<br />
Now let's put all this to one side (again), and look at arena rankings (in the only bracket that matters) - <br />
http://www.sk-gaming.com/arena/team/3/all/all/all/all/<br />
<br />
LOOK YOUR TOP !!! SHOCK HORROR.<br />
IN FACT, RMP HAS DOMINATED EVERY SINGLE SEASON SINCE SEASON ONE.<br />
<br />
In short, what Blizzard, me and every other non rogue is trying to tell you is this - <br />

It's amazing, they are not fixing vanish because &quot;rogues are dominant in both PvE and PvP&quot;... ???<br />
<br />
What a lame excuse.<br />
<br />

Vanish Bugs<br />
Vanish failing is a bug, but it's a hard one to fix, and rogues are dominant in both PvE and PvP despite of it, so it's also not a &quot;all hands on deck&quot; problem either. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19820641443-browsed-a-few-topics-not-impressed.html))<br />
<br />
It's amazing, they are not fixing vanish because &quot;rogues are dominant in both PvE and PvP&quot;... ???<br />
<br />
What a lame excuse.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
kinda the same way they fail with priest's.<br />
They wont fix shadow spec's - takes too much time.<br />
At least thats what it sounds..</div></div><hr />

You havent been near the state, that spriest's are to be found at atm!<br />

Spriests do insane AOE damage, as do rogues even post FoK nerf.<br />
They should probably lower spriest AEO damage and increase their single target damage.</div></div><hr />

I seriously want to know what kind of program or method they are using to determine our DPS. We compete with shamans for dead last. Awesome!<br />

I think that just because there is 1 spriest in some world first kills they think it's fine. It's the same excuse they use for balancing tanks.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has tried to fix the vanish issue a couple times. A lot of it has to do with latency...there was a post about it a couple years ago. In a perfect 10ms ping system it basically won't happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not really a gear or scaling issue. It's a rotation problem. You could sit on a target dummy and perfect your rotation for hours but when you do a real encounter it doesn't work that way. We did some testing and any movement based fight screws over a shadow priest. If you miss re-applying your dots (or 2 mind flay's) because you're running and have to re-apply them your dps drops up from 500-2k until you've corrected the rotation. And if you get stuck doing adds on a fight that you can't aoe on your numbers drop even more. So to maximize dps we kept our shadow priest always on the boss.<br />
<br />
I play a feral druid and my wife plays a shadow priest and believe me the feral is far more forgiving. My wife switched to her hunter for the sole reason that she can be competitive now with the same computer, same latency, etc even with being undergeared.</div></div><hr />

So, Blizzard admits to making the rogue dominant in both PvE and PvP. That explains the Shaman Thunderstorm and Shamanistic Rage anti-stun nerfs.<br />
<br />

I guess a better example is feral druids, they are near the top of meters I assumed this is because they are very difficult to play (not assuming facemauler or easymode addons), why don't shadow priests get the same treatment?<br />
<br />
<br />
Normally I don't QQ about such things, but this is one that hits close to home since my old main (spriest) and new main (druid) are involved.<br />
<br />
Basically, stop sucking. Straight to the point. Why do I say this? Well, as an spriest, I don't suck and I continue to top charts for any encounter. Any encounter. Any encounter. At the same time, with comparable gear, I suck like no one else when it comes to Kitty DPS. Really, it just doesn't come naturally, even with an addon, it just doesn't amount to anything. If I'm lucky with procs I can do 3K, which is still 5K less than my priest. I just don't get it. Buffing my already top notch DPS just makes me giggle like that girl I gave the candy to at the mall.</div></div><hr />

Did you just imply that you can do 8k dps on a shadow priest? Seriously? That's barely possible in full T9.258 and BiS We're not talking mind sear on geist packs in Naxx btw. We're talking serious comparable boss dps here.<br />
<br />
Look at WMO class comparison records. Spriests dead last or bottom 3 EVERY SINGLE FIGHT. Look at Rawr and SimCraft, spriests have the lowest theoretical dps out of EVERY dps spec in the game, in many cases by 30-35%. I want to see an armory for your priest and feral druid and see what amazing feats you've accomplished with your 8k dps spriest.<br />

First off, let me say that if you're top dps as a spriest, your group blows or you outgear them by far. Secondly I like how you tell someone to stop sucking when its painfully evident that you are in fact the one who blows hard since you can handle the easy spriest rotation but are unbelievably terrible at the hardest dps rotation in the game (cats). My cat has worse gear than my priest and I can consistently do much higher dps on him even with begin stupid with my rotation occasionally.</div></div><hr />

If you'd read the post you quoted, priests are well behind every other class in the game in dps. According to http://elitistjerks.com/f77/t73364-shadow_priest_gear_discussion_totc/ (which I wouldn't question), the top simcraft parse has us at 8585. Other hybrids simcraft at between 9.5 and 10k, pures at 10k+. Check EJ if you think I'm joking.<br />

According to http://elitistjerks.com/f77/t73364-shadow_priest_gear_discussion_totc/ (which I wouldn't question), the top simcraft parse has us at 8585. Other hybrids simcraft at between 9.5 and 10k, pures at 10k+. Check EJ if you think I'm joking.lmfao did you seriously just call spriest dps easy?<br />
<br />
not just easy, laughably easy.</div></div><hr />

And the one name that jumped out at me was Halduron Brightwing, the current ranger-general for the Blood Elves. While he might be needed at Silvermoon, I dont see why the current ranger-general wouldnt want to learn from the previous one, Sylvanas Windrunner. Makes sense in my mind, anywho.<br />
This makes alot of sense actually, especially with the follow up post that mentioned needing more than &quot;shots&quot; in the &quot;dark.&quot; Halduron's last name Brightwing, would certainly lighten the mood in UC.<br />
<br />
My personal vote though is to have Nathanos. EPL was only a setback, and where he won't lighten the mood, he can certainly provide some levity.</div></div><hr />

Balancing your GCDs, not clipping dots, filling your MB cooldowns without wasting time, multi-dotting (esp tracking 3 different dots on 3 targets), knowing when to mind sear and when to tab target, and maximizing uptime. If you think shadow dps is simple, it's no wonder your cat dps is so much higher. Parse plz.</div></div><hr />

Blizz actually saying &quot;Vanish failing is a bug&quot; is a huge step from 5 years of vanish is working as intended <br />
<br />
<br />
Took BZ 5years to realize it's a BUG.. another 5years to fix it?<br />

I don't even know what you mean by &quot;balancing your GCDs&quot; <br />
Not clipping dots? Seriously? VT and DP are the only ones you need to worry about, VT is the only one that is not instant and takes a little bit of practice to know when to reapply.<br />
Not too familiar with an aoe encounter when applying dots to aoe targets would be beneficial.<br />
The only possible difficulty would be keeping track of dots on multiple targets which can be easily accomplished with a simple timer addon and is not necessary very often. <br />
Besides single target dps means just that: 1 target, not applying dots to multiple targets, which is the problem with spriest dps.<br />
You clearly have far too high of an opinion of yourself if you really believe there is any level of difficulty to a shadow rotation.</div></div><hr />

If you think spriest is easy and cat dps is hard, i seriously don't know what to say. and i can't take you seriously until you post a parse showing uptime and %damage.</div></div><hr />

Agree with this. There's not really a massive amount to be done as spriest. A bit of MF clipping and timing VT application, not exactly hard stuff is it? Really, what is a spriests rotation? MB, VT, DP, MF (stack 5) SW:P..... and then you can forget about SW:P, leaving you with only 4 buttons to press. Am i missing something??</div></div><hr />

I don't have one, but I can refer you to: http://www.mmo-champion.com/general-discussions-22/what-class-has-the-hardest-most-complex-rotation/ and if you're more into flowcharty stuff: http://i43.photobucket.com/albums/e388/vertidog/catdps.jpg And im pretty sure anyone who has played both classes will laugh their asses off when you tell them that spriest dps is harder than cats. Then when you tell them you're serious they'll most likely laugh some more.</div></div><hr />
