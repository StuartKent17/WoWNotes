As soon as you hit Level 110 on a character, all of your relic slots are unlocked right away.<br />
You no longer have to do the Broken Shore quest line to allow your artifact to go beyond 34 points.<br />
As soon as you hit 110 in Patch 7.3 you will have Level 41 Artifact Knowledge. After that it will increase weekly automatically, no more research required. <br />

No. Raid is 7.3.5.<br />
<br />
Also you are right. It's tuning. KJ was tuned way too high which Blizzard admitted.<br />

You can't judge the population of a game by Mythic raiders either. They are the minority.</div></div><hr />

The article says, under the new legendary ring, said that the &quot;raid [is] coming in Patch 7.3: Antorus, the Burning Throne&quot;, leading me to think it was coming sometime before 7.3.5.<br />
And yes, KJ and the previous boss or 2 are overtuned - despite KJ being nerfed at least twice already since the world first for weeks now. Seems the difficulty level is still not quite right for this many good guilds to still be struggling.<br />
<br />
As for mythic raiders being the minority, of course they are. But traditionally, the clear rates have been somewhere around 1-3%. Currently they're at 0.09% of all raiders.</div></div><hr />
