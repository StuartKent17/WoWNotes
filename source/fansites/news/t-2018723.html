<br />
Legion - End Game Rewards<br />
Blizzard attempted to clarify how the random upgrade of items will work in Legion:<br />
<br />
<br />
Every item has a base item level and those that can be upgraded are usually listed with a + after the number, such as world quests that reward 810+ gear.<br />
When you earn an upgradeable item, the system rolls for a +5 upgrade. If it succeeds, it continues to roll for +5 upgrades until it fails.<br />
The cap on these random upgrades is set globally, somewhere in the 850s before raids open.<br />
After Mythic+ dungeons and the Nightmare Raid are accessible, this cap goes up to 895. <br />
Items are labeled Titanforged when they are upgraded +15 item levels or more.<br />
<br />
<br />
There's a fair bit of confusion around how item level of end-game rewards works in Legion - understandable, since we haven't really gone into detail about how the system works, instead focusing on high-level goals and philosophies. Let me take a crack at changing that.<br />
<br />
Scaling vs. Static Item Level - &quot;Anything Can Happen&quot;<br />
This came up in the first Legion Q&amp;A a couple of weeks ago, but in past expansions, the endgame item structure has always been defined by a rigid series of flat plateaus. In Warlords, Normal dungeon loot was Item Level 615. Heroic dungeon loot was 630. Normal Highmaul was 655. And so forth. Once you had Raid Finder gear or better, there was zero value to items from dungeons. In patch 6.2, Tanaan Jungle only offered Baleful items that could be empowered up to item level 695. If you were a Hellfire Citadel raider, setting out to do Tanaan dailies (to unlock flying, let's say), there was zero chance that anything could happen during that play session that might make your character stronger. And in a game underscored by progression, that's a shame.<br />
<br />
In essence, Legion changes those flat item-level plateaus into peaks that taper up to a global max potential item level.<br />
<br />
When you earn an item from nearly any endgame source (dungeon, raid, world quest, PvP strongbox, mission, etc.), it has a chance of upgrading its quality. When looking at information on your rewards in sources like the Dungeon Journal or World Quest display, you'll see these items with a &quot;+&quot; next to their item level, indicating this chance to upgrade (e.g. the Dungeon Journal for Heroic Legion dungeons showing &quot;Item Level 825+&quot;).<br />
<br />
While there's a bunch of math behind it all, this may be a useful way of thinking about it: When generated, these items have a chance to roll a +5 item level bonus. If that roll succeeds, the system rolls again for another +5 bonus. If that succeeds, it rolls again. This process continues until an upgrade roll fails or the global item-level ceiling is reached. That's it. <br />
<br />
And so, in Legion, even if you're a raider, if your friend is looking for someone to queue Heroic dungeons, you have an extra motivation to volunteer aside from pure altruism. You probably won't get an upgrade. But you might. Anything could happen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Titanforged&quot; - What's the Deal?<br />
Titanforged is just a label that applies when an item successfully upgrades by +15 or more item levels. It isn't really an inherent part of the system itself, but rather something we added midway through development to make it clear when you just got exceptionally lucky. <br />
<br />
RNG, Progression, and Prestige<br />
A frequent concern with the Legion item system is that the very possibility of a Mythic-raid-quality item coming from a quest or dungeon boss cheapens those rewards. But there's a huge difference between a single Mythic-quality item and a full set of gear of that quality. A player who mainly queues for Dungeon Finder and Raid Finder may end up with a couple of great raid-quality pieces, but that's a far cry from what someone who actually does high-end raiding will look like. Ditto for someone who casually queues for BGs compared to a top-rated arena player. After all, it requires far fewer lucky breaks for a Mythic Nightmare raid drop to make it to Item Level 895 than it would for a Heroic dungeon blue, by a huge margin. Your overall gear will still reflect the type and difficulty of content that you do, but a broader range of activities can be rewarding, and a broader range of players can have moments of surprise and excitement along the way.<br />
<br />
Another concern raised in this thread relates to the impact of randomness on competitive progression. First off, the explanation above references a &quot;global item-level ceiling&quot; - that's simply a cap on how far any item can upgrade, and it's a value that will be set in relation to the highest available base item levels from the most difficult available content. Once Mythic+ dungeons and the Nightmare Raid are accessible, that value will be 895 (and that's the value to which the cap is currently set in beta). But for the first couple of weeks after launch, we're planning on having a lower cap in the 850s, since there is nothing available above that base item level. In the future, as new content is introduced, the ceiling will rise accordingly. Even the very luckiest person in the world won't be walking into raids and outgearing them on day one.<br />
<br />
Finally, we're dealing with upgrade chances on individual item slots out of 16, belonging to individual characters out of 10-30 in a raid group. A single item won't make or break your raid's success. The law of averages suggests that raid groups that complete roughly the same amount of content will end up with roughly the same item level. We feel that the system will be a significant improvement to the individual gearing experience without harming guild competition.<br />
<br />
My main question was - will Heroic and Mythic raid gear be able to upgrade past Warforged?<br />
Since &quot;past Warforged&quot; just means &quot;by more than +10 item levels over base,&quot; the answer to that is &quot;yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Let me use some entirely made-up numbers as an example:<br />
<br />
Let's assume that the chance to upgrade is 50% per +5 step to simplify the math. Clearly that is NOT the actual chance, as anyone who's been playing at max level on Beta can attest. But let's pretend that whenever an item drops, we flip a coin and bump the item level by +5 every time it comes up Heads. And we continue until we either flip a Tails OR the item reaches Item Level 895.<br />
<br />
Let's consider three Emerald Nightmare drops: one from Raid Finder (835+), one from Heroic (865+), and one from Mythic (880+).<br />
<br />
The Mythic Nightmare raid drop is guaranteed to be at least 880. We flip our imaginary coin (again, these are NOT the actual odds...). 50% of the time it'll come up Heads (woo, 885!), so we flip again. Again, half of the time we get this far (25% chance total, now) it'll come up Heads again (890!). And so we flip yet again, and yet again half the time we make it this far, we'll get yet another Heads (12.5% total). That bumps the item to 895, which is the cap, so we stop flipping coins and the item ends up at +15 over the base 880, which makes it Titanforged.<br />
<br />
Using these hypothetical, made-up numbers, if you looted the same item from a Mythic Nightmare boss 8 times, you'd expect on average to see four 880 versions, 2 885 versions, 1 890 version, and 1 895 version.<br />
<br />
Now let's look at the Heroic base item. That starts at 865, so you'd need to upgrade it six times (i.e. flip six Heads in a row, using our analogy) for it end up at 895. I'm not going to step through the probability tree again, but the 1/8 chance above now becomes a 1/64 chance. You'd need to loot 64 Heroic Nightmare raid items on average to see a single 895. The Titanforged chance (again, not the actual odds!!) would still be 1 in 8 (12.5%), since that just means 3 successful consecutive coinflips, but that would only bring the item to 880. You need to get much luckier to get all the way to 895.<br />
<br />
Finally, our Raid Finder item. With a base Item Level of 835, it needs to upgrade 12 times to make it all the way to 895. Long story short, that's a 1 in 4096 chance of being 895. Let's say you get 2-3 items a week from fully clearing Raid Finder. You'd need to run Raid Finder every week for over 21 years in order to have a &gt;50% chance of seeing a 895 item out of Emerald Nightmare LFR. By that time, we'll all be in item level 4000 gear as we play the latest Corgis Unleashed expansion on our VR decks (unlike the rest of this post, this part is entirely factual). But hey, you'll probably have that 895 Raid Finder item. Or you still might not. Still feel mandatory?<br />
<br />
As this example hopefully illustrates, you're best off spending your time on the most challenging/rewarding content that you can tackle. This isn't destroying the foundations of WoW itemization and replacing it with massive randomness - by and large, players will progress through content of increasing difficulty and/or organization requirement, earning more and more powerful items as they go.<br />
<br />
I'm going to assume that items can also roll warforged, for a maximum of 901? That's totally cool by me, but confirmation would be neato. Haven't managed to find an example of a high-TF WF item on beta yet.<br />
Nope. &quot;Warforged&quot; as you know it in Warlords is gone with Legion, and isn't a separate system stacked on top of this one.<br />
<br />
A &quot;Warforged&quot; item is one that got moderately lucky rolls (+5 or +10 over base). &quot;Titanforged&quot; kicks in once you cross the +15 threshold.<br />
<br />
895 is the highest item level you will see while Emerald Nightmare is the active raid zone.<br />
<br />
<br />
FEEDBACK: Darkbough (Normal)<br />
The Emerald Nightmare raid zone is now accessible in Normal difficulty, with Nythendra, Il'gynoth, and Elerethe Renferal accessible. Normal difficulty scales from 10 players up to 30, and players must manually form groups to enter the zone. Player level and item level will be scaled accordingly. Please use this thread for feedback. We plan on keeping these bosses available for a couple of days.<br />

Dominate Mind Temporarily Disabled in PvP<br />
We have recently become aware of an exploit involving the Priest’s Dominate Mind talent which has been causing disruption in rated PvP. We’re currently working to fix that exploit, but while those investigations take place, we’ve temporarily disabled Dominate Mind in instanced PvP. Once the issue has been corrected, we will re-enable it.<br />

I wouldnt bother. The odds of getting raid level items from quests are virtually next to none. The zone chapter quests (those that give blue gear of higher level), at level 110 are still at 785. Ive had a couple of lucky rolls bumping them to 805. But knowing that heroic dungeon gear starts at 825, amd world quest give 825 or 835+. It would be a waste of time to delay the turn ins. You would have more luck winning the powerball than getting a raid ilvl off of quest gear.<br />
<br />
So far with my beta experience. The only preparation you need to do early on is geavily focus on your class order campaign. Your later progression is actually gated behind finishing the whole story. I dont think zone quests per say are required to be finished to do this. But its actually mandatory for each raider to finish the campaign before raid opens. As it unlocks the 3rd relic slot on your weapons (30+ ilvl boost).</div></div><hr />

I'll admit I wasn't sure what was what levels things ended up at (I only got into the beta a few days ago). I'm definitely not going to bother raiding until the raids open up though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">yarjin</div><div class="date">2016-06-28, 06:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why they don't give green text to an item that doesn't receive any upgrade? Like &quot;getrektforged&quot;. It doesn't feel right when you don't have huge green text under item name. Yes, in english it's just &quot;Heroic Warforged&quot; (example), but in russian it is &quot;Героический Предмет закалённый в бою&quot;. <br />
Also with this system of excitement I lose any excitement of obtaining item (fuck, that shit didn't roll even +5, total bs). Just like normal and ancient legendaries in D3. Yeah, I got it, I'll put it in the cube. And it doesn't give me an extra motivation to queue heroic dungeons, because I don't visit casino to earn extra money. I'd really like to hear people they are talking about, those extra motivated to visit heroic dungeons, while they do heroic raids.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't same ilevel bump apply to dungeons, but dungeons ilevel starts at higher number? Therefore it would make more sense to farm dungeons trying to get lucky ilevel boost rather than doing world quests.</div></div><hr />

When you earn an upgradeable item, the system rolls for a +5 upgrade. If it succeeds, it continues to roll for +5 upgrades until it fails.<br />
The cap on these random upgrades is set globally, somewhere in the 850s before raids open.<br />
After Mythic+ dungeons and the Nightmare Raid are accessible, this cap goes up to 895.<br />

Ahem...We already have this system in WoW. Tannan drops and mythic dungeon drops. Now they are just extending it to everything. Chances of anyone winning a high ilvl &quot;decent&quot; item is extremely small. Mythic dungeons proved that..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its really not that different from previous warforged systems, just that it can roll a bit higher with exceptional luck.<br />
You could just ignore the entire thing and still play the game just fine. In fact that is what most people actually should do, don't try to gather warforged/titanforged gear, but instead just gear like anyone would, by tackling increasing difficulty of content - and if WF or TF procs, you get an extra reward and it might actually feel rewarding to get lucky for once.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's bad enough having RNG in not knowing if the item will drop or if you will win the roll (in case of non-personal loot). But all random upgrades are a thing I hated from the start.<br />
<br />
Even worse are random upgrades on items which are not that good for your spec, like random quest items, or random loot from a rare which is not even useful for your character. <br />
<br />

Not all of us consider it a horrible movie. I liked it and would love to see a Director's Cut. Since you didn't care for it I wonder why you felt the need to trash it.</div></div><hr />

You can throw as many numbers at us you want, that doesn't change the fact that if there's even a 0.000001% chance for it to happen, IT WILL HAPPEN.

But leaving that aside, let's imagine the following scenario: X who has more luck than a whole guild together, but raids only LFR and Normal has a higher chance at getting an equipped ilvl of 895 (also, remember that now you can get tier from LFR) than me who raids Mythic, or well, now I'll have to do everything (which requires an absurd ammount of time).

A guild raiding mythic and actually being competent at it, will not just grab any joe with the right itemlvl, nor will they replace a core member due to shitty luck with drops.<br />
<br />
Nothing you said makes any sense and is just baseless strawhat arguments, the odds of getting full 895 from LFR before that gear becomes obsolote is so stupidly small it literally will not happen, no one will get a full 895 from titanforged before the mythic raiders do :P<br />
<br />
And no you do not need to do anything besides your current content, mythic raiding rewards 895, it does not require it.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
This is one of the failed design decisions which will be directly queued behind Garrisons when Legion ends. Blizzard has lost its finess long ago, what to expect from amateurs.<br />
<br />
Yeah how dare they make the game more interesting for 99% of the playerbase, this is an RPG based on loot progression, making content never stop being relevant is a VERY good idea.<br />
<br />
I'm baffled at the level of entitlement people are showing because its now possible to get an unexpected reward for well, pretty much anything.<br />
<br />
It's fun to get a good item when you dont expect it, and the game needs to be fun and its content needs to stay relevant, aka it needs to drop good enough loot for people to care about doing it. And this system assures that.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
So.. if you want to have BiS gear at some point you need the luck to have the appropriate item to drop, and if that RNG is not random enough we're gonna need nothing but luck to get the best variant of the desired item....<br />
<br />
Nope, ... ffs.... Mythic drops 895, anything below mythic, yeah it can roll up to mythic gear itemlvl, but not above it.<br />
<br />
How hard is it to grasp? The only thing this changes is that now EVERYONE can get the absolute BiS for a raid tier, if they are insanely lucky, which no one will be :P<br />
<br />
And even if you might realise that mythic raids lack a certain stat combo for one of your slots and a lower itemlvl piece boosted to 895 would be better, well though shit, then you better go do that lower itemlvl content if you really want that item... And wow, all of a sudden you are doing content you would otherwise ignore because you desire a good piece of loot. In a lootbased RPG; that is good design.<br />
<br />
Besides, atm you cant have perfect BiS with mythic warforged gear, some slot will always have an undesired stat combo, just because it will technically be possible in legion doesnt make it mandatory.<br />
<br />
And also, having everything BiS in a game about getting better gear?... Well thats GG there isnt it? I'd rather keep something to strive towards itemization wise :P</div></div><hr />

I think you should read the blue post again. Even with the crazy inflated 50% it would take 21 years to have a proper chance of a mythic level item coming from LFR, and that's only 1 item.<br />
This system is designed around just doing what you are already doing and having a slim chance to be happier with the loot that you thought you'd get, nothing more.<br />
For some reason everybody seems to automatically assume we are all crazy lucky and get all mythic gear from this system. Even having the right gear being dropped sometimes takes long, why would be all be getting crazy ilvl upgrades now?<br />
<br />
I like the system as at it's core it allows me to help someone with content no longer relevant for me but still have that possibility to get something out of it, even if it's very small, it's there.</div></div><hr />

You do realize that most guilds which have originaly been 25M still have core members laying around and switch them around, right? Doesn't even have to be old 25M guild, you do not have only 20 members in your guild if you are actually competent at raiding.<br />
<br />
Yes, indeed, the chance it's so small that yesterday on LFR I saw the same person get two 890 items within the same LFR.<br />
<br />
As I said, you don't have to, but you are telling me that you wouldn't want to help your guild progress faster by getting better items? :P<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying you'll see people everywhere walking around in full 895 obtained only from LFR, but I saw quite a few guys that got almost full 725 gear from Mythic Dungeon, it will happen in Legion too and imo it impacts progression in a negative way, as luck might weight more than skill if the luck is high enough. No, a rank 1000 guild won't surpass Method or Serenity or w/e other top guild, but the top 10 ranking could flip around overnight.</div></div><hr />

Like &quot;getrektforged&quot;. It doesn't feel right when you don't have huge green text under item name. Yes, in english it's just &quot;Heroic Warforged&quot; (example), but in russian it is &quot;Героический Предмет закалённый в бою&quot;. <br />
Also with this system of excitement I lose any excitement of obtaining item (fuck, that shit didn't roll even +5, total bs). Just like normal and ancient legendaries in D3. Yeah, I got it, I'll put it in the cube. And it doesn't give me an extra motivation to queue heroic dungeons, because I don't visit casino to earn extra money. I'd really like to hear people they are talking about, those extra motivated to visit heroic dungeons, while they do heroic raids.<br />
<br />
All the gear in this game is RNG, so by that logic you shouldnt do any content what so ever?... Yes this is another level of RNG; but its still just RNG loot, I think you're making an argument out of the illusion that you can aim for a specific piece of gear and get that 100%, because you can never do that in this game.<br />

I'm saying, any decent guild wont just discard a player because he had bad luck, and yeah I will be doing pretty much everything each week that I can for as good gear as possible. Because WoW is my only entertainment source atm, since I cant make time for anything else due to shitty work hours, but I can make time for dungeons, a few raids and LFR each week. Not to mention world quests.<br />
<br />
The beta has increased drop rates to test out the systems :P I would be amazed if it wasnt, they probably have the same chance as we got on live now for that first +5 and then it rolls again for each subsequient +5% :P<br />
<br />
I'm just saying, for the game, this is a GREAT change, it will make the vast majority of the playerbase happy and it will keep the game interesting longer :P<br />
<br />
Yes and the top 10 raiding guilds isnt what this game should be built around, because that is less than 1% of the playerbase, hell its probably less than 0,1% of the playerbase.... Games are to be designed around fun and gameplay, not competition, there are esport games oriented for that shit.<br />
<br />
So what if someone gained 725 from mythic dungeons, he'd have the luck but does he have the skills? if he does, he now has good enough gear to be given a chance to prove it, if not, well then he has shiny gear but he isnt really a top tier raider is he?</div></div><hr />

Do you need skill to kill bosses in 20seconds with 16 mages? Just saying. With enough gear you can bruteforce most fights.<br />
<br />
P.S: Wanna make this clear, I do not care for someone casual getting a high ilvl item, that's great for them, it can keep them playing and interested. And while I agree that Mythic raiding is a small percentage of the game, it's still an important part of the game and I don't think that so much RNG will lead it in a good direction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The &quot;specific piece of gear&quot; from LFR - if we use Ion's odds for example - have a chance of 0.02%. 50 times lower than the 1% of mounts.<br />
And this is just for the maximum ilvl roll, now add the chance for the right item in the first place, what is that? Maybe 10%? so we would get 0.002%.<br />
Have a nice time farming it then.<br />
One or two items like that on one person will change nothing in a raid.<br />
<br />
Start seeing the standard version of an item as 100% and the upgraded one as 110% or whatever your actual roll is.</div></div><hr />

Theres nothing special about anything anymore. Its all just raw numbers, and thats a stupid thing to do in an MMO. There will be more enjoyment from getting, say, one of the old Dragonsoul weapons than getting any Legion item, since RNG stacked on RNG, stacked on RNG over and over and over removes any value items may have once had.

7 years of farming for the right binding in MC.<br />

<br />
&quot;Gambling is the wagering of money or something of value (referred to as &quot;the stakes&quot;) on an event with an uncertain outcome with the primary intent of winning additional money and/or material goods.&quot;<br />
Now considering time is valuable and we have a uncertain outcome and we have the intent of winning additional goods... I think i qualifies for gambling.<br />
And even playing the lottery (so buying a piece of paper with some numbers to maybe win a few million euros) is considered gambling. So yes, this may backfire greatly. And since some gear source have no lockout, people will farm them day in and day out. Either getting their parents up-set or using bots. Both will lead to a loss in subs for Blizzard.<br />
<br />
You can quote me on this one thing: There will be bots to run normal/heroic dungeons and people will use these to get gear. And then Blizzard will ban them.<br />
<br />
Diablo 3 has the same basic problem, but at least you don't have to pay for that gambling machine more then once.</div></div><hr />

Mythic dungeons drop better loot. You'd be better off doing the dungeons for loot.<br />

Unless of course the PvE set bonuses drop from LFR, in which case mythic dungeons were just devalued further.</div></div><hr />

Mythic dungeons have a weekly lockout, don't they? So spamming heroic dungeons is a endless try at the slot machine.<br />
And didn't they add Tier Sets boni to LFR in Legion, or did they revert that?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kamuimac</div><div class="date">2016-06-28, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You do realize that most guilds which have originaly been 25M still have core members laying around and switch them around, right? Doesn't even have to be old 25M guild, you do not have only 20 members in your guild if you are actually competent at raiding.<br />
<br />
Yes, indeed, the chance it's so small that yesterday on LFR I saw the same person get two 890 items within the same LFR.<br />
<br />
As I said, you don't have to, but you are telling me that you wouldn't want to help your guild progress faster by getting better items? :P<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying you'll see people everywhere walking around in full 895 obtained only from LFR, but I saw quite a few guys that got almost full 725 gear from Mythic Dungeon, it will happen in Legion too and imo it impacts progression in a negative way, as luck might weight more than skill if the luck is high enough. No, a rank 1000 guild won't surpass Method or Serenity or w/e other top guild, but the top 10 ranking could flip around overnight.<br />
<br />
top 10 guild will be done with mythic before lfr even opens so its not a problem whatsoever - the ones that care much about it are the tryhards around world 500-1000 who depend much more on overgearing mechanics then executing them properly . besides why care in first place - those people will never apply to mythic guilds and even if they applied they would probablyhave no clue what logs even are not speaking about making good numbers on logs so you wont notice them unless you are some sort of armoury stalker.</div></div><hr />

That is cool, it is not why the system is here, it is not so that you can farm it and get that item you wanted. It is so, that if you run heroic dungeons while helping a friend, or as part of your gearing process, you might get lucky and get a piece with +20ilvl, maybe more or just +5. It is random and low probability especially because they don't want ppl to farm it.<br />
<br />
It is easier, if you're a ok player, to run Mythic+ all week and be sure to get an item with the minimum ilvl of the M+ level you're selected (+ maybe upgrades too).<br />

1) Cannot find anything about it... but even per instance that's not that much loot in comparison to endless trys at heroic.<br />

Yes I'm one of the ones who're regretting their Legion purchase even more. If it weren't for the fact I'll be paying my sub only through gold, I'd probably be even more annoyed. And I guess instead of making more reasonable ilvls and numbers like the original purpose of the squish was in re-balancing, they now just have the mindset to re-squish every couple of expansions it seems, otherwise I'd never imagine ilvl 900 loot nearly just by the end of the 1st raid set.</div></div><hr />

Before this implementation people could farm badges, run Raids, and knew at the end of the day/week they could get an upgrade and work towards it. They had a goal to improve and get there as efficient as possible. Now you flip a coin and don't get rewarded for working harder as someone else.<br />
They wanted Blood of Sargeras to be a &quot;reward&quot; to show how much you play, well maybe gear should go back more to: the more I play and effort I put into the game, the better my rewards should be ?

Well, the total randomness of loot was definitively one of the reasons why I have stopped playing D3 after 2 or 3 weeks. The other was the low amount of active keybinds. I hate when I constantly have to manipulate my keybinds because my current setup does not work in a special situation. I want all skills and spells be available to me on my keybinds, and I want to have a robust talent setup. (This is one reason why I don't raid anymore in WoW, constant talent shuffle requirements.)<br />
<br />
Anyway, if WoW at some point will become too much of a Diablo clone, I will be out. I probably will be playing for some time with tokens, until my gold runs out, and then this will be it.</div></div><hr />

After all, it requires far fewer lucky breaks for a Mythic Nightmare raid drop to make it to Item Level 895 than it would for a Heroic dungeon blue, by a huge margin. Your overall gear will still reflect the type and difficulty of content that you do, but a broader range of activities can be rewarding, and a broader range of players can have moments of surprise and excitement along the way.<br />
<br />
What if I aggressively queue for BG's because I do not have an arena team or I just don't like arena at all? Am I at a disadvantage? Are we being told that running and investing 3 times as much of our time in BG's will not pay off because it isn't arena rating?<br />
<br />
Arena isn't the only PVP that matters. Fact is running BG's are the only PVP I enjoy. Now I am being told for certain that I will be at a PVE disadvantage because of the type of PVP I choose to do. What a load of crap.<br />

The biggest problem for a lot of raids is hitting a gear wall. This system gives raids incentives to continue progressing and farm slightly old content as well as do dungeons. This will make everyone feel like there is more content. I like it a lot.<br />
<br />
Maybe for a guild without a point loot system. All this does is hurt players who invest in gear drops that are normal. You are just another person too focused on personal loot. As if it is the only loot system.</div></div><hr />

Depends if you want to get a possible gear advantage in the race for world first, yes.<br />
Otherwise World Quests will be your biggest source of out door loot and they are just like daylies, so no reason to leave them out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. If you want BIS, do the highest difficulty content. If you can't do the highest level content, then you still have a chance at BIS with a little RNG tossed in. Sheesh.<br />
<br />
Look at it like this:<br />
<br />
Old model:<br />
<br />
Normal raids drop ilvl 600. That's it. That's all you got.<br />
<br />
Heroic raids drop ilvl 650. That's it. That's all you got.<br />
<br />
Mythic (highest level content) raids droped ilvl 700. That's it. That's all you got.<br />
<br />
New Model:<br />
<br />
Normal raids drop ilvl 600 at base but now have a chance to upgrade to even higher ilvl! You could get up to 700 right here! You'd have to be lucky but now you have that chance!<br />
<br />
Heroic raids drop ilvl 650 base but now can drop up to 700 with luck!<br />
<br />
Mythic drops ilvl 700, the best in the game. Even mythic raiders can supplement their gear by going to the other content if they're not having great lucks in their run.<br />
<br />
Now there's a reason to do old content once you've completed all the other stuff but since it's RNG, you don't feel forced to do it. But if you have nothing else worth doing or if you want to help a friend, now you have a good reason.</div></div><hr />

But even mythic has 15 iLevels below the Cap, so even mythic doesn't reward best in the game, it only has a chance to.</div></div><hr />

I'm telling you why<br />
Diablo is coming to WoW<br />
<br />
Interestingly enough, while you could have picked a ton of new features in WoW which are directly picked from Diablo. None of the above actually are in Diablo. Go figure. It's an extension to Warforge system that have been in place before Ancient items came to Diablo3.<br />
<br />
I think what you meant to say is that, features from the 21st century are finally coming to WoW.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SidFwuff</div><div class="date">2016-06-28, 07:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you should read the blue post again. Even with the crazy inflated 50% it would take 21 years to have a proper chance of a mythic level item coming from LFR, and that's only 1 item.<br />
<br />
Sure- but that's upgrading LFR up and past Mythic. <br />
<br />
What about bumping Normal gear to Heroic? or Heroic to Mythic? What would those odds be like? Stretched across an entire guild. 20 attempts per boss per difficulty per week...<br />
<br />
It took me over 20 kills on Council to see my Mirror drop. I used a seal every time- got two each of every other piece of gear Council dropped through Seals alone- took 5 months.<br />
<br />
Now, what if I killed them three times per week instead? What are the odds that a normal mirror that dropped gets upgraded to Heroic iLvl? Or hell, maybe even Mythic.<br />
<br />
And that's just current raid. Some BRF mythic trinkets were better than Heroic HFC trinkets... you farm Mythic BRF once per week the entire time you're progressing through HFC... and there's some decent odds that a Mythic BRF trinket becomes titanforged and it's better than non-titanforged mythic HFC trinkets. Wouldn't that have been nice to have until you got a titanforged mythic HFC trinket?<br />
<br />
Now the really interesting thing: What happens if Tier 19 tier bonuses are better than Tier 20 tier bonuses?<br />
<br />
How many item levels does Tier 19 have to be upgraded by to become superior to Tier 20? +20? +10?<br />
<br />
Plus, from the sound of it- once Tier 20 is released, the 895 cap will be raised throughout the expansion- which means it probably won't be too uncommon to see Mythic Tier 19 that's above 895 once the cap is raised.<br />
<br />
In other words... clearing all four difficulties, and clearing multiple raids, per week is back baby! :cool:</div></div><hr />

They used the math to show how hard it would be to get 895 but what about how much more reasonable it will be to get 865 or 880? In order to progress in mythic you would want heroic level gear, which with this system is possible to drop from LFR, so why would any serious raider not do it? Yes the BEST loot in the game may be impossibly rare but there is a fair chance of getting loot that could progress your mythic character in LFR, thus sending any serious raider to that mind numbing, soul draining, pointless task of jumping in circles for 3 hours while you wait on your loot slot machine.<br />
<br />
You're not forced to do anything....This is a solid change. I'm a mythic raider and don't see this as a way to force me into LFR. If anything, it actually will make helping my less progressed friends on my main more of a benefit than it is now. Right now, friend asks hey...can you help us on so and so heroic...sure let me see what alt i can play...typically pick least geared alt jump in and help...least geared alt pretty much brings nothing to the table to help....I'm just looking for some form of character progression...With this..I will be more keen on helping on my main as there's a chance I can get much better loot.</div></div><hr />

Yes, but those 5 raids a week were not the norm, most people didn't do that amount.<br />
With Legion you get every difficultiy bloew your highest AND all dungeons AND mythic+ to do...<br />
So if you are raiding mythic: 4 * #raids + 3 * #dungeons + UNLIMITED mythic+ levels * #dungeons<br />

And i'm not talking about op-stuff from LFR, but huge variety of 1 piece of gear. Just like D3<br />
<br />
Depends how low &quot;extremely low chance&quot; is. If it's really fucking low then for all intents and purposes it is never because it CAN NEVER serve as motivation to participate in any given piece of content. A good reward for participating in content is meaningless if it's a unicorn. The developers have this on backwards as usual. It's good they want to add significant rewards to other content but putting it behind a dice roll (an apparently extremely skewed one) is bad and what's worse is that it's not gonna cover every spot or have comparable set bonuses to raiding. Like they will do everything in their power to dance around the simplest fucking solution that WE KNOW WORKS. Currency acquisition at a steady pace that allows you to buy tier/trinkets/weapons on a vendor. More determinism in the game offered in activities outside of raiding that award the same gear even if it's a reduced ilvl and at a slower pace. They are apparently philosophically opposed to this on some basic level and it may require that they be fired but that's fine. <br />
<br />
Basically if youre a raider I wouldn't worry about it. You could skip all the non raid content and be just as far ahead as if you participated in other content. You are more likely to have 4 piece bonus before you will see any upgraded mythic dungeon or world quest loot and if the set bonuses stay as stupid as they are you won't want to abandon your set bonus anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Damn it Blizzard you and your silly idea of putting gear in the game that far exceeds the level you actually need to clear content so people have some incentive to keep running that content! Such a terrible loot system! Clearly they should just make it so you can grind a certain amount of currency guaranteed and buy the best gear possible so your e peen doesn't shrink! Lulz<br />
<br />
I bet you guys didn't even realize you don't need the legendary rings at all to clear all raiding content in WOD let alone for your whole raid to have them fully lvl'd up.<br />
<br />
All this really means is people are probably going to have a whole lot less ridiculous requirements to join some shitty pug. Big whoop. In exchange you get a system in place that allows your character to progress all of the time instead of hitting a plateau and having no meaningful way to gear up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you play this game for fun, or to increase your item level? If you find world quests fun, do world quests. If not, choose something else to do. Legion seems very much based on playing the game the way you find fun.<br />
<br />
If you don't do the world quests it's not as if you're going to get better RNG in return for your sacrifice. Your choice is between a chance at gear at 850 or not getting any gear at all because you refuse to play at all if the tiny chance of getting a ridiculously good item isn't in play yet. Besides, for the first few weeks of the expansion 850 is great. Heroic dungeons drop 820.<br />

<br />
No, their math is right.<br />
<br />
The first roll is a 50% chance of an upgrade. If it succeeds, it rolls again. If it succeeds again, it upgrades twice. This is a 25% chance-- you're not flipping a single coin twice, you're flipping two coins at once.<br />
<br />
Now, if it succeeds the second time it flips a third coin. You have a 12.5% chance of all three coins coming up heads.<br />
<br />
You'd be right if the rolls were independent, but they aren't because you stop flipping the coin after the first time you land on tails. The rolls are NOT independent of the previous rolls.</div></div><hr />

Or people could just not focus on that RNG part and keep the loot they actually deserve from the content they got the loot from. This system is a little bonus upgrade, you shouldn't try to beat it or fish for it. If you do you'll get frustrated so I hope people will just get over that mindset and just play the game.<br />
<br />
This system is not intended for end game gear (the ceiling for mythic items is only 15 item levels above the base level, that's like warforged), this is intended for low end gear that could get a bonus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What slightly concerns me are basically trinkets because those are more unique compared to other item slots. <br />
<br />
My understanding of the system is this: When tier 1 of raid opens (Emerald Nightmare), everything can roll up to 895. Then when tier 2 opens, everything, including items from tier 1 raids, can roll up to 910 (?). Is this correct?<br />
<br />
If it is, I can see the necessity of repeating old contents just so people have a shot at getting titanforged trinkets (with a lot of RNG layers). It just seems to me that it might be better if you can just accrue +ilvl upgrades &quot;tokens&quot; via rng instead, but that obviously comes with its own issues as well.</div></div><hr />

It gives me, and a lot of people it seems, not more incentive to run that &quot;old&quot; content, but less, since the odds are so low to actually get an upgrade and we prefer to know the gearing path we take. There is nothing &quot;fun and compelling/exiting&quot; at running content for days/weeks on end and not getting that piece you worked for, while someone who barely logs in does end up getting it due to that RNG luck. <br />
Before this implementation people could farm badges, run Raids, and knew at the end of the day/week they could get an upgrade and work towards it. They had a goal to improve and get there as efficient as possible. Now you flip a coin and don't get rewarded for working harder as someone else.<br />
They wanted Blood of Sargeras to be a &quot;reward&quot; to show how much you play, well maybe gear should go back more to: the more I play and effort I put into the game, the better my rewards should be ? Seems they overturned their philosophy on different aspects of the game differently and keep swapping every expansion just because they want to keep it &quot;fun and exiting&quot; while it brings nothing but frustration and grief in the end.<br />
This is just my 2 cents and this is in no way a representation of what the majority thinks, but a lot of my friends do agree (and some here on forums) that this layer of RNG into RNG is not rewarding or fun at all. Hate me for all you like, but I expect people to quit over this eventually.<br />
<br />
A) RNG has been a part of the game from day 1. Everything worthwhile has a &quot;chance to drop&quot;. If everything was guaranteed, you would do something once and never repeat it again...so removing RNG is a silly and ridiculous idea.<br />
<br />
B) You don't get rewarded for working harder? What on earth are your talking about? So mythic raiding isn't harder work than world quests? Normal mode raiding isn't more work than normal dungeons? Anytime you invest more time and effort on in-game activities, the rewards are commensurate. Having a casual get a single high level piece does not equate to them being decked out in said gear. No need to blow this out of proportion.<br />
<br />
C) Badges to upgrade your gear weren't available until the very end of the expansion (after the fervor of the progression race was long over). Try again.<br />
<br />
D) You can still run raids for a chance at upgrades. Absolutely nothing has changed about that aspect of the game from live, except Legion, if anything, has a HIGHER chance of an upgrade than now. How is warforged/sockets any different than possible item level upgrades?!</div></div><hr />

<br />
gee...that's pretty snarky in its own right there my friend...I'm actually shocked that some minor stats could get under your skin to such a degree...which says a lot about you to be honest...<br />
<br />
but more to the point and to answer you and the poster above you to which you refer here's a lengthy article regarding the probability of getting a streak of heads 20 times in a row supported by some very sophisticated math:<br />
<br />
http://marknelson.us/2011/01/17/20-heads-in-a-row-what-are-the-odds/<br />
<br />
for those not willing to read it the author concludes that &quot;So at last, we know the correct result. If you flip a coin a million times, you have a 38% chance of seeing 20 heads in a row. A long way from the certainty claimed by the New York Times, and a bit off from my initial 60% value&quot;.<br />
<br />
And contrary to the assertion of the 1st responder the fact that the rolls only continue if heads occurs on the prior roll does not mean that the rolls aren't independent of each other only that you stop rolling once you get tails OR hit max level. The odds of rolling heads on each subsequent roll remains 50% because the &quot;roll&quot; has no memory of the prior result and is otherwise independent of it as long as the condition to continue rolling (getting a head on a previous roll) is met. <br />
<br />
Now, obviously, Blizzard would never use a 50/50 chance mechanism to improve your gear because of the fact they understand that there is a 38% of &quot;rolling&quot; heads 20 times in a row. <br />
<br />
But not using a 50/50 system in reality does not alter the fact that the explanation provided grossly understated the possibility of maxing out the ilvl of a piece of gear using the system described.<br />

I reacted the way I did because of your arrogant response, condescension, and pearl clutching &quot;What scares me the most!&quot; I honestly have no idea what you are even arguing here. I am not sure if you are actually even arguing in good faith based on your follow up reply because it is so far off base and irrelevant that it's difficult to even decide how to respond. But i want to try in case anyone reading this thinks that you have any idea what you are talking about. <br />
<br />
We aren't talking about a streak of 20 heads in ONE MILLION flips. We are talking about a single item that drops and what the chance is that it goes from 835(lfr) to 895 in one shot. Even using their totally made up 50% example it should be very clear to see that the probability of making it to 12 upgrades (60 ilvl / 5 per upgrade) IN A ROW to max out ilvl is VERY LOW. I'll wait here while you start writing out your H's and T's. <br />
<br />
You are fluidly interchanging the concept of probability, odds, and god knows what else in your argument but the fact remains that while the chance of each upgrade succeeding is 50% in our given example, the probability of it succeeding 12 times in a row is very small because all we actually care about is when the upgrade chain stops and we actually get the item in our bag. The individual chance of each upgrade is completely irrelevant to what we are discussing here. Each upgrade chance IS connected to the one before it because without a successful upgrade prior, there is no future upgrade. It's a continuous sequence. <br />
<br />
The only time that your article about 20 heads in one million flips is even relevant is if you earn several thousand upgrade chances via quests, drops, etc and all that actually describes is what the probability is that ONE item out of all those thousands of items fully upgrades to 895. News flash, the chances are actually not so bad and is likely exactly what they want. For an LFR person to get a real lucky break and come out with a mythic item. That is precisely why they aren't worried about people showing up in mythic raids with heroic + gear in all slots or the impact that will have on progression and why many people here are trying to explain that it would be silly to burn out running unwanted heroic dungeons and LFR &quot;For an edge&quot; because the chances are so low that you might as well use your luck playing the actual lottery because at least if you win that, it actually matters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're an awfully sensitive person then because the level of &quot;arrogance, condescension and pearl clutching&quot; in my post was either negligible to begin with or pretty tame by MMO-Champion forum standards.<br />
<br />
I am merely &quot;arguing&quot; that the example of odds they used wasn't entirely accurate and as such caused me mild concern regarding how well thought out the system was because, and this is pretty straightforward, if you can't accurately explain something it undermines one's confidence in your ability to design a system you can't explain. Nothing more or less complicated than that.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, as the first article on roulette points out (and hitting red or black is an almost identical 50% situation as to the one they described), the &quot;lucky&quot; streaks of multiple occasions where the ball would land on red or black consecutively 8 or more times in a row will even out over a million spins BUT you don't need to spin a million times to get such a lucky streak because the first time it could happen is in the 1st 8 spins.<br />
<br />
The article further supported the notion that each spin or roll is independent of other and on each new spin the odds of hitting red or black remain 50%.<br />
<br />
Casinos actually rely on the fact that the wagers people make in games of chance are influenced, as note in the article, by previous results that ACTUALLY don't have an effect on the outcome of the current spin or hand etc. The explanation they used to describe the hypothetical example essentially repeated this fallacy.<br />
<br />
As I said I don't really have an issue with the proposal per se but do with the explanation of it and was merely pointing out, for the record, that it may have been misleading. My apologies if pointing out this mistake was offensive to you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Wouldn't that in fact mean that they are independent?<br />
<br />
Either way, every roll is 50% to get upgrade or no upgrade.<br />
Your chance to get 3 upgrade in a row might be 12.5% tho.</div></div><hr />
