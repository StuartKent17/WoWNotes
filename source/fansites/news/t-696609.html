As we prepare for the public testing phase of minor content patch 3.3.3, some players might come across information regarding upcoming content that isn't yet available. To avoid any confusion, we'd like to tell you about an exciting new raid dungeon we are working on for content patch 3.3.5.<br />
<br />
The Ruby Sanctum<br />
<br />
A powerful war party of the Black Dragonflight, led by the fearsome Twilight dragon, Halion, have launched an assault upon the Ruby Sanctum beneath Wyrmrest Temple. By destroying the sanctum, the Black Dragonflight look to crush those that would stand in the way of their master’s reemergence into Azeroth and to ultimately shatter the Wyrmrest Accord – the sacred bond that unites the dragonflights.<br />
<br />
The battle that is to come will surely deal a crippling blow to the Red Dragonflight, however, it is up to you to stop this unprecedented offensive and defend the Ruby Sanctum. First you must face the assault of Halion's servants, Saviana Ragefire, Baltharus the Warborn, and General Zarithrian, before squaring off against Halion the Twilight Destroyer, a new and deadly force in this realm.<br />
<br />
The Ruby Sanctum will feature 10- and 25-player content, Heroic difficulties and all-new rewards! Stay tuned for more information as we get closer to its release.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The battle that is to come will surely deal a crippling blow to the Red Dragonflight<br />
<br />
I'm think Alexstraza might be hurt. Not dead, but hurt enough where she is out until 4.2 or so. (yeah, i know, name spelled wrong, sorry).<br />
<br />
This could lead to:<br />
<br />
1: With Ysaera sleeping, and nozmordu(sp?) of fighting a war in time, there would be no aspects able to fight Deathwing's return.<br />
<br />
2: This opens the door for Renegade Red Dragons to step in and fight against &quot;mortals&quot;. Per wowwiki:<br />
<br />
The red flight was once charged with the protection of all living things on Azeroth. In time, their vision became clouded. Humanoid races were in an uprising, and some red dragons insisted that they must make war upon them to protect the wilderness. Others believed that the mortal races could be allies to help in bettering the world. This led to a great schism within the red flight that has never been repaired. <br />
<br />
3: Bolvar could &quot;technically&quot; stay in enough control to keep the scourge at bay, and he is able to do this due to the 'energy' (call it what you will) that Alexstraza's flame gave him. Hurt her enough, that flame will go out, the evil spirit overtakes him, 5.0 the scourge comes back.<br />
<br />
Rip apart, flame, etc...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Given that the Ruby Sanctum raid is not part of the normal flow of content progression, I highly doubt the gear quality will be higher than ICC.<br />
<br />
More likely, 10-man Ruby Sanctum will drop itemlevel 251, and 25-man Ruby Sanctum will drop itemlevel 264. If it's anything like OS, it could potentially drop higher level gear if done in &quot;hard mode&quot;, probably 258/271 respectively. Thus making it as a supplementary raid to ICC, and not as a &quot;higher level raid&quot; above ICC. If they go this route, then Ruby Sanctum would be to ICC, what Zul Aman was to SSC/TK.</div></div><hr />

I was about to say that, Onyxia have the same ilvl as Trial of the Crusader, so I think this Ruby Drake raid should have the same ilvl as Icc.</div></div><hr />

With the curent WOtlk player Zul'jin would be a cockblock for atleast 75% of the &quot;we killed 10 man icc in 25 gear so we pro&quot; guilds.<br />

Its not.<br />

Fact is, they staggered out the release of ICC as much as they could to keep us busy until Cata, they realise Cata wont be released in time so we wont have enough content to keep us busy, so they give us the Ruby Sanctum to keep us busy until Cata is released.<br />

I guess I should have seen the Twilight Dragonflight involved, through their connection to Deathwing; infact, how did I not click that together?<br />

Regardless, looks like an intriguing content patch. I'm interested in how Halion has managed to infiltrate the Ruby Sanctum; his whereabouts previously is, I'm assuming, unknown, any information regarding his origins would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

I was pointing out the fact that you claimed to be database hacking when you linked Nefarian as Helion. Sarcasm is a tricky thing, and far too often you see people making these claims to mess with others rather than as a joke. <br />

now if you DO have some legit(legit hack lol) information then please share it. But the way you made it sound you were trying to be serious when it was fairly obvious that what you were saying wasn't correct, hense my comment.<br />

I think 3.3.3 is the PvP battleground stuff that got posted about yesterday. The LFBG tool, death of BG marks, and rework of the BG holidays. I suppose there might be other stuff too, but those are pretty significant changes.</div></div><hr />

that would be the worst decision to ever make if your going to have a raid out for almost half a year and nothing else you will lose a lot of players being to bored with the game adding a new raid is actually a very smart thing to do it keeps the game fresh and not dull like it would be by may. Now if they didnt release a new raid i guarantee you would lose a large portion of players why because everything would be the same and there would be nothing new and shiny for them to kill idk about you but i prefer the new and shiny things to kill rather then i killed this thing for the past 6 months and now i finally get to do something else.</div></div><hr />

Thats what im saying..<br />
<br />
Theres many people claiming that this content patch is a sign that cataclysm is SOONER than we think.. Which is the stupidest claim ever.<br />
<br />
This content patch just means that they can delay cata further as we will have something to keep us busy, as, once again, blizzard cant deliver on time and have to provide us with a filler raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Edit: blue posts up about the place. HM will most likely be like LK insofar as a UI toggle. Gear will be on par with ICC loot. LK is still meant to be hardest fight in wrath. Minor RP tie ins to Cata this is not delaying cata rather giving people more to do until then.</div></div><hr />

As we prepare for the public testing phase of minor content patch 3.3.3, some players might come across information regarding upcoming content that isn't yet available. To avoid any confusion, we'd like to tell you about an exciting new raid dungeon we are working on for content patch 3.3.5.<br />
<br />
The Ruby Sanctum<br />
<br />
A powerful war party of the Black Dragonflight, led by the fearsome Twilight dragon, Halion, have launched an assault upon the Ruby Sanctum beneath Wyrmrest Temple. By destroying the sanctum, the Black Dragonflight look to crush those that would stand in the way of their master’s reemergence into Azeroth and to ultimately shatter the Wyrmrest Accord – the sacred bond that unites the dragonflights.<br />
<br />
The battle that is to come will surely deal a crippling blow to the Red Dragonflight, however, it is up to you to stop this unprecedented offensive and defend the Ruby Sanctum. First you must face the assault of Halion's servants, Saviana Ragefire, Baltharus the Warborn, and General Zarithrian, before squaring off against Halion the Twilight Destroyer, a new and deadly force in this realm.<br />
<br />
The Ruby Sanctum will feature 10- and 25-player content, Heroic difficulties and all-new rewards! Stay tuned for more information as we get closer to its release. <br />
<br />

ICC was to be the last MAJOR raid of Wrath. There was always the well-known possibility that another small raid would bridge the gap between ICC and Cat. (both in terms of covering the time gap and as a bit of a bridge in lore between the two expansions)<br />
<br />
They haven't said that it'll drop slightly better loot, maybe it'll be the same ilvl (given that its part of a minor patch, its certainly possible), who knows. At the very least, reserve that judgement for when the information is known.</div></div><hr />

I agree with you for the most part, but I expect Blizzard to keep their typical &quot;we need to keep subscriptions going&quot; thing going; Cata isn't ready ready, they're tossing in some random fill-in stuff and, to keep players going, they will need to keep increasing the ilvl on nw loot.<br />

<br />
OMG, Ruby Sanctum is just a &quot;filler&quot; so that Blizzard can delay working on the &quot;real content&quot; (whatever that means)! OMG, Ruby Sanctum defiled the holy sanctity of ICC being the last WotLK raid content!<br />
<br />
Seriously, if Cataclysm came out tomorrow and were to be totally awesome in every way, people here would be complaining about how they didn't have enough time to farm ICC and finish up old world quests and how there wouldn't be a proper lore bridge between the expansions.<br />
<br />
<br />
Agreed Cata is still miles away but adding filler for the 99% of ppl will keepem happy.</div></div><hr />

Assault on the Ruby Sanctum - Patch 3.3.5<br />
As we prepare for the public testing phase of minor content patch 3.3.3, some players might come across information regarding upcoming content that isn't yet available. To avoid any confusion, we'd like to tell you about an exciting new raid dungeon we are working on for content patch 3.3.5.<br />
<br />
The Ruby Sanctum<br />
<br />
A powerful war party of the Black Dragonflight, led by the fearsome Twilight dragon, Halion, have launched an assault upon the Ruby Sanctum beneath Wyrmrest Temple. By destroying the sanctum, the Black Dragonflight look to crush those that would stand in the way of their master’s reemergence into Azeroth and to ultimately shatter the Wyrmrest Accord – the sacred bond that unites the dragonflights.<br />
<br />
The battle that is to come will surely deal a crippling blow to the Red Dragonflight, however, it is up to you to stop this unprecedented offensive and defend the Ruby Sanctum. First you must face the assault of Halion's servants, Saviana Ragefire, Baltharus the Warborn, and General Zarithrian, before squaring off against Halion the Twilight Destroyer, a new and deadly force in this realm.<br />
<br />
The Ruby Sanctum will feature 10- and 25-player content, Heroic difficulties and all-new rewards! Stay tuned for more information as we get closer to its release.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lol, idd m8, it surprises me to see that we havent got any Scarlet Crusade raid, seeing we had that Scarlet Onslaught thingy. Perhaps they will delay Cataclysm with a Scarlet raid. But i reeeeaaallly hope not.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frozenbeef</div><div class="date">2010-02-27, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So its basically saying the other dragon flights wont be part of the cataclysm because they are too &quot;weak&quot; because of this battle?<br />
<br />
Ah well its better than not including them and not giving a reason....</div></div><hr />
