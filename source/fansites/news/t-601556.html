Nothing for the EU Players yet, but we can assume that it will be activated today or tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Yes, premades may be back soon, just be a bit more patient, I know it's not easy, but we are investigating the issue.<br />

<br />
Let's also add a list of the changes, to make it look like a work a lot. <br />
<br />
Patch Notes<br />
2.2 Patch notes are hidden somewhere here<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Major mechanics change<br />
DoTs damages are now lowered by resilience. <br />
Most crowd control spells got their duration reduced to 10 sec in PvP (Seduce, Freezing Trap, etc ...)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
New Mounts<br />
Spectral Tiger Video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8gb3luiMqk&amp;eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Emmo%2Dchampion%2Ecom%2Findex%2Ephp). It will be a reward from the upcoming trading card game expansion. <br />
Broom Flying Mount Video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bDyp8H3_oo&amp;eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Emmo%2Dchampion%2Ecom%2Findex%2Ephp). No official informations yet, but it's probably some kind of reindeer-like transformation for an haloween event. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
New items<br />
New Arena shields. Price and skin are the same as the current warrior shield. (Healing Shield (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/july/shield1.jpg), Spell Damage Shield (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/july/shield2.jpg))<br />

Zul'aman preview #1, Tigole post about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Voice Chat<br />
It's not activated on the PTR yet, but it's still rumored to be released in 2.2, most of the interface is already available in the current PTR client and Rob Pardo said that the voice chat will be available in the &quot;next software update&quot; during an interview with OCRegister (http://gadgetress.freedomblogging.com/2007/07/11/blizzard-adds-more-goodies-to-world-of-warcraft/)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Item Changes<br />

Most of the AQ enchantments mats were changed from Nexus to Prismatic shards. <br />
You can now transmute Nexus Shards into Small Prismatic Shards. You can also split 1 Large Prismatic into 3 Small.<br />
Mage Arena Season 2 set stats got changed. (Stats here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/july/mageseason2.jpg))<br />
Warlock Arena Season 2 set 4-parts bonus was changed from &quot;Reduces the casting time of your Immolate spell by 0.2 sec.&quot; to &quot;Reduces the casting time of your Fear spell by 0.2 sec.&quot;<br />
Warlock Tier 5 armor set bonuses were changed.<br />
(2) Set: Causes your pet to be healed for 15% of the damage you deal. <br />

<br />
Two things. First, typo in the post: under the first blue quote, it says &quot;all items come with a full tier 6...&quot;<br />
<br />
Second, a question: do the epic gems listed only require the gems at the bottom of the recipe, or are there other mats involved? Seems like a generous upgrade, to go from 18 +healing per Living Ruby straight to 26, for example. I'll take it, but seems like there might be strings attached, aside from the rep required.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
the gems will be unique-equipped<br />
<br />
so u wont be able to socket all your gear with 26 healing gems...lol...just 1...the rest will be the regular 18</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also its interesting that they decided to bring this back. I remember that when the PTR's came out everyone used to make a character to taste the power.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skyl</div><div class="date">2007-07-20, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Zul'aman isn't in the game yet, probably going to be 2.3 patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was true at the time of this post.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was posted about an hour (maybe 2) ago that it would be down for less than 4 hours to fix bugs related to the transfers and premades.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flakor</div><div class="date">2007-07-21, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also make note that it takes two days to transfer the Pre-Made character.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What do i need? Patch and what else? If i install patch, will i be unable to play the &quot;normal&quot; version? Omg, im so excited to try this! :D<br />
You can play the live servers with the PTR installed, you can get into the PTR (when you have it installed, ofcourse) by going into your wowtest folder and opening the client or open it from the launcher.</div></div><hr />

More like simple mages/voodoo doctors. Zul'Jin is still not finished and the pre-Zul'Jin guy is said by wowwiki to be 'massive, naturaly huge claws' and stuff like that. So I'm pretty sure he is a Dire Troll.</div></div><hr />
