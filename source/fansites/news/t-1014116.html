For those of you who didn't win and can't/don't want to buy one you can probably find the pet at your local auction house for a reasonable price now that the first cubs bought yesterday are no longer bound to their owners.<br />

Patch 4.3: Madness of Deathwing<br />
Once again n1kftw (http://www.youtube.com/user/n1kftw) has supplied us with a video of Madness of Deathwing. The fight is now fully available on PTRs and even if it still needs to be tuned, it should be more accurate than the videos we've seen previously.<br />

Blue Posts<br />
Monk Class Color<br />
Right now the monk is jade green. We like the color, but it's not absolutely set in stone. For those wondering how this would work with the hunter green, it's as different as the colors are for mages and shaman. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/205124/monk-class-color) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3424801326?page=2#26))<br />
<br />
Updating old Tier armor sets textures resolution<br />
We don't have any plans to tamper with the art of existing tier sets. Transmogrification is being implemented, in part, to allow nostalgic players the option of wearing old gear without having to worry about the stats anymore. But, we don't want to go back and actually alter those looks. That'd almost defeat the purpose, especially given we'd prefer to focus our time on designing new sets to allow for more customization options (including aesthetic, stat-less sets to be used solely for Transmogrification).<br />
<br />
The art and animation teams are incredibly busy, and sometimes I feel they don't get enough credit for the amount of work they do, or how much work is involved in each project. There are a number of projects on their list -- many of which players would love to see progress on -- but this isn't currently one of them that I'm aware of. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/205120/old-gear-new-looks) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3424470679?page=1#6))<br />

I felt that the Lich King fight in Wotlk was slightly lackluster but this just seems to be really bad for a final boss. The aspects should be more prominent in the fight not just giving some buff but additional dps or off tanking some gnarly thing that would smack the raid if a tank or someone was dumb enough to taunt it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL, so 10USD is 60k gold? You're either full of it or gamers are actually Wall Street bankers and will never hinder the Chinese farmers. If I'd ever even consider buying ingame gold, this cub would not be an option. Not for 60k. Not when the cub is unlimited supply and really nothing exclusive.<br />
<br />
7k is a reasonable price, I guess.</div></div><hr />

For anyone who has a job they will be able to purchase that pet in less than 2 hours (or in 1 hour or less depends on how awesome your job is), While ingame it takes far longer than one or two hours for most to amass 6/7k gold. So I say let the prices for them plummet, once it gets cheap enough i might even buy one just because.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It didn't say only the ones who buy 12 month subscribers will be able to join the Beta. It said that people who do buy it are guaranteed to be able to join. Which means that it's just one way of probably several ways to get in to the Beta. <br />
<br />
<br />
And for people saying that the Deathwing fight is &quot;meh&quot; well if this fight had been added in Vanilla or even TBC and WOTLK people would be all like &quot;wow shit this is epic&quot; but today standard are so high and people are just bored of wow. Would you really trade this for old version of dragon fights where he lands and fight like (vael, sindragosa, sapphirion etc.) and has a flight phase just like sindra and sapphirion? At least blizzard is doing something new with fighting dragons.</div></div><hr />

I have an idea for the encounter... let the dragon soul fall from the sky, and be randomly assigned to players of the raid, this dragon soul acts like a taunt and deathwing is after that guy, so this one has to run away from the hot fire beam, while only range classes can shoot him at the skys. Dragonsoul can be passed to other players via throwing like vash encounter if beam gets to close. When DW is at 50% his wing collaps and he is attackable by ground, and now its the range turn to deal with some crazy stuff while the melees hack away... In the end thrall shows up uses doomhammer to crack his skull and opens a giant rift in the ground and sealing the corpse there. And for the ladys: Aggra spills Thralls baby out in the end because of all the stress and, they arange like a happy little family!<br />
<br />
And Deathwing drops his chin as a legendary tank shield, which just was kept secret, distracting the community with some stupid rogue daggers (IoI daggers for one class, how could you believe that)</div></div><hr />

I am from an EU server and I bought the cub for £8 and your screenshot on the front page off mmo-champion which shows<br />
the cub sellin for 6000 gold has ruined our market!<br />
<br />
Even though there aren't many people selling no one is willing to pay more than 6-7k to buy the cub and many of us sellers feel this is largely due to the fact that your website is giving people unrealistic expectations of the price for this and I'm sure many many servers.<br />

People on this forum have been warning about this for months. Nobody is going to pay high prices for these cubs, and they won't be a reasonable way to 'make gold' at all, in another few weeks you'll probably be lucky to make 2k on a cub.</div></div><hr />

Did you honestly expect an item that has a 100% guaranteed unlimited supply, is VERY easy to obtain, and has a small low demand market to begin with would sell for more than that? I'm honestly surprised they are even going that high. In a week or 2 if they sell for more than 1-2k I will be stunned.</div></div><hr />

I guess I didn't pay attention when it was first announce cause I never noticed that. Doesn't change what I said thou, including beta access to MoP for buying a years worth of subs, while getting an exclusive mount... while getting diablo III for free... It seems desperate. Expanding it to 6+ countries make it seem even more so that they are desperate to lock people into a 1 year contract of sorts to boost subscriptions. Im not being a hater, Like at all... Im about as unbiased as it comes. For example, I love macs, I love the simplicity and file structure. I love the way apps work. But I completely detest iOS, and for that matter the idea of the mac app store, for the simple fact it gets under my skin that they, Apple, are the ones who say what can and cant be put on a device I paid 200+ for, While at the same time doing everything within their power to stop jailbreakers from taking full control of their device. It does seem like a desperate attempt to get people to resub.</div></div><hr />

Thanks, mmo-champion, for even giving me a chance. It was fun going to bed thinking that I might wake up to find a guardian cub notification in my in box.

You know what would be awesome as well? A YouTube guide of Chaud actually building the narwhal system, then donating it to a worthy cause. Aren't there some gamers out there who do some sort of wow marathon for charity? Bet they'd like a nice mmo-champion sponsored narwhal system to play on.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't change what I said thou, including beta access to MoP for buying a years worth of subs, while getting an exclusive mount... while getting diablo III for free... It seems desperate. Expanding it to 6+ countries make it seem even more so that they are desperate to lock people into a 1 year contract of sorts to boost subscriptions. Im not being a hater, Like at all... Im about as unbiased as it comes. For example, I love macs, I love the simplicity and file structure. I love the way apps work. But I completely detest iOS, and for that matter the idea of the mac app store, for the simple fact it gets under my skin that they, Apple, are the ones who say what can and cant be put on a device I paid 200+ for, While at the same time doing everything within their power to stop jailbreakers from taking full control of their device. It does seem like a desperate attempt to get people to resub.<br />
<br />
Maybe you don't realize, people in the mentioned countries were pretty upset they were not allowed in on the deal. Blizzard didn't extend the offer because they were desperate, they added those countries to settle the outcry of people who weren't allowed in.<br />
<br />
While most people focus on the sub argument, they fail to notice the real hook of the deal. Blizzard will get to claim every annual pass subscriber as a first day sale of D3. Seems to me the bean counters at AB figured out that so long as they can get a large player base, the real money auction house will more then pay for the free clients they pass out, and the hype machine they can generate by claiming millions of sales in the first day will help to further drive profits.<br />
<br />
WoW still has millions of players, millions more then it was ever intended to have. People thinking that Blizz is desperate to get, keep, or recover subs is laughable. I'm sure they want more subs, but desperate is a stretch. WoW has already payed for itself many times over, and generated more profit then it was ever imagined it could. It's just a brilliant marketing tactic.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure they want more subs, but desperate is a stretch. WoW has already payed for itself many times over, and generated more profit then it was ever imagined it could. It's just a brilliant marketing tactic.<br />
<br />
Honestly, when has Blizzard ever done something for their customers in recent times because it was the right thing to do? Blizz is completely profit driven, evidence of such can be found by googling for the blizz store. They expanded it to other countries, for profits nothing more, nothing less. Because honestly, When has blizzard ever did something for the customers because they wanted it? How long has it taken them to implement a raid finder? How long has it taken them to add transmogrification? How long has people been asking for cross server heirlooms (and please do not say it would take a lot of time to record, the blizz store does EXACTLY what people want. make heirlooms add a flag to your account and poof your done. Simple as that). They expanded it, for more money.<br />
<br />
I will agree thou that the real money AH will generate quite a bit of money for them, considering I came from a f2p game before I started wow. Its insane how much money people will blow for the dumbest of items. It will help them with claiming quite a large number of sales on release day for D3, But considering the quality of work released by current blizz devs... Which in my opinion is kind of lacking (based solely on my experience with wow in the last year) I dont expect their to be a huge amount of hype for D3 no matter how many numbers they claim. But then again the general populace doesn't exactly... research things for themselves. So you are correct about that helping to boost profits.<br />
<br />
Wow does still have millions of players, But they have lost over a million in less then a year. Thats anywhere between I think.. 13m - 15m a month they are no longer recieving. No company is that well off to be able to ignore a drop in profits of that magnitude. They have lost alot of money within the last 6 months. They have to come up with some way to recover those funds, Which in my opinion they are trying to do by offering wow players a sweet deal to lock themselves into wow for 1 entire year upfront. I do not know how many subs they have now. But last I knew i think it was around the second quarter or something they had lost an additional 600k subs as well as the earlier 300k subs. I expect more have left since that time. so if you do math for 13m per month over a 6month time period is a grand total of 78 million dollars. Of course this is all based on what i've read as well as basic math. I don't know if they recovered the majority of those, But i kind of doubt it. A lose of that many customers is kind of a massive hit to the company. Now.. just imagine what it'll be after dec 20th. Where i know a HUGE amount of people are only playing wow until tor comes out. lol Half my guild was waiting for it to come out. So in my opinion, it makes them seem kind of desperate. I will agree thou wow has paid for its self time and again, But now comes the time when they have to upgrade the game, and everything people suggest to upgrade the game to have better models, or systems or w/e they always use the same excuse's &quot;its to expensive&quot; or &quot;we dont have the time&quot;. That will come back to bite em in the ass.<br />
<br />
But! I wanted to say thank you for actually posing an argument instead of just calling me ignorant, or a dooling idiot, or attacking me.. or something like that for having my own opinion. Its quite rare to have that now a days. So I thank you for the intelligent conversation. =] Maybe they aren't bad off. Maybe blizzard is trying to be nice to people for once and doing something because the fans want it. What i've said is merely what I personally feel. I don't really know. But for now.. when dealing with blizzard products im kind of on the fence and dont really expect them to care about the customer all that much.<br />

The answer for your question doesn't even have to go that back... real-id invites for dungeons. Used to be a premium service, but they gave up the bad idea. You can say anything you want about their decision, but the decision by itself, was the right thing.<br />
<br />
But yes, the D3 deal is more a desperate tactic. Expanding the deal to other countries isn't, ppl were asking why they couldn't get the deal too (remember that Brazil is getting their WoW right now, but not the D3 promo?), so it's just a &quot;fix&quot;.<br />
<br />
I see the D3 deal more of &quot;Plan B&quot; for MoP launch. Like &quot;There are high chances that MoP will fail hard, so at least we lock ppl for 1 year to try to save it no matter how bad it may fail&quot;. Sure, all the other &quot;perks&quot; come with it like &quot;millions of D3 sold at launch&quot; and all, but also a smart way to try to keep their new &quot;non-gamer/social game from facebook&quot; wow player base, since this group would hardly keep going for more Blizzard games (or other games at all).</div></div><hr />

shure they could have joined just for this action.... but meh.<br />
<br />
Anyway, congratulations<br />
<br />
It's WAAAAAY more likely that they just created their accounts to enter this giveaway. If I didn't have a user and I saw a giveaway I'd make an account, it's not like it's hard. They deserve it just as much as anyone who spends time here every day.<br />
<br />
Grats winners.</div></div><hr />

If they're handpicking, they would just say that they choose one of the two posts... if it's an automated system, disqualification should have happened right away.<br />

That's probably the reason for this kind of giveaway, increase the number of new possible readers :(<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, with one of the winners posting twice, I find it hard to believe they were that eficient for not having ppl using multiple accounts and even winning more than one pet.</div></div><hr />

As for the contest, and the winners... Most of these contests are designed to bring readership to MMO-Champion. If it takes a contest to do so -- so be it. Technically, everyone had a chance of winning. Putting a 10 post count minimum, or a 30 day account requirement would have excluded a lot of people. They were trying to do something nice for the community (new and old) as a whole. They didn't have to provide the contest to anyone, and keep the $150. Thanks MMO-Champion for having this contest.</div></div><hr />

OH MY GOD! EVERYTHING'S RIGGED! BOUBOUILLE HATES ME AND DIDN'T PICK ME THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE! (Yeah, you go batshit angry on me, I get mean)<br />
<br />
A lot of people double posted because of our spam filter, we basically had to disable it after 10 mins because we had 1000 entries blocked by the filter and some of these people assumed it was just a bug and tried to post again.<br />
<br />
The selection was made by grabbing the list of usernames of people who posted in the thread, the amount of posts didn't matter. In the case of Starfairy his posts were within 20 minutes, and one of them was before we disabled the spam filter for the time of the contest. <br />
<br />
As for people registering just for the contest, there's no reason to not let them participate. If we start discussing who should and should not be eligible, I don't see why we should let people who had infractions in the past participate, people with less than 10 posts, people who haven't been around for at least a year, people who havent quoted me in their signature, etc...<br />
<br />
Don't cry because you didn't win a contest that only required you to reply to a thread, of course it's ridiculously easy and of course there will be a ridiculous amount of entries. I'll come up with a super elitist contest that requires tons of work and better prizes at some point to make you guys happy, don't worry.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gramexer</div><div class="date">2011-11-03, 06:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You guys must realize that there was no rule about posting twice.<br />
<br />
Posting multiple times increases your chances if they just do random roll from 1 - to &quot;whatever was the post count back on then&quot;<br />
<br />
But if they checked and made list (this can be automated with few scripts or SQL querys) who has posted to topic and made roll with that info, double posting doesn't increase your chances.<br />
<br />

And you just proved my point. I'm by no means trying to whine or argue against the choices because I didn't get picked. I was merely concerned for the fairness and equity of the contest itself. But if you believe that's grounds for being rude and obnoxious, you seriously need to re-evaluate your priorities.</div></div><hr />

Deathwing, destroyer of worlds, creator of sparkle ponies..<br />

If that's how the final battle will go, meh. extremely uneventful. Wheres the steam from all that water boiling off? Why didn't the flow of the water down the Maelstrom (and where does all that water really go anyways? Its NOT in Deepholm) be restricted any by him blocking its flow?<br />

It's nowhere near the same as buying gold. There is no new gold being generated, the gold is just trading hands. If they &quot;sold gold,&quot; gold would be generated, and flood the market. This is not the case.<br />
As far as it being BoE goes, people were selling pets regardless of the BoP tag, and a lot of people were getting scammed.<br />
<br />
So, with your logic, people selling trading card game mounts (bought IRL with real money, sold in-game for hundreds of thousands of gold), which are in fact also BoE, is Blizzard &quot;selling gold&quot; too, no?<br />
Oh wait, it's not.</div></div><hr />

Buying gold even if its not new gold is still cheating. Whats next? being able to buy chars starting at level 60? I would no longer put it past them.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc65c405abf8</div><div class="date">2011-11-04, 12:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure what to think of the Madness of Deathwing encounter. It looks pretty boring at times, with the only thing making it interesting is the platform-hopping (that's kinda cool tbh). I do like how the entire raid has to move as a group. I'm all for coordination in boss encounters. Take Sindragos (ICC) for example, I loved it when I was to be bombed into an ice tomb and making it to my designated spot at the bottom of the stairs in time to throw in a funny pose as I got frozen to the spot, hehe. No seriously, everybody had a spot and you needed to get there in time or it's a wipe. I like that. Instead of moving out of the poop, you had to go somewhere to get into the poop, or you'd wipe the raid, haha! So anyway, thumbs up for the coordination on Madness of Deathwing. Platform hopping looks very cool. <br />
<br />
Graphics seem a bit meh-ish, imo. I know it's still PTR, but final product won't differ that much from current graphics.<br />
<br />
I don't quite understand the point of the encounter, though. Are we gradually going to break random body parts till he has nothing left to stand on? Falls down and &quot;Oh look, it's the head, let's nuke his brain!&quot;? Yeh I know I sound like a noob, lol. It's how my head works, I won't understand a fight completely until I have actually done it. I need to know why we have to do what and what happens when we don't. Someone tells me to not stand on the left and I probably will. Someone tells me WHY I can't stand on the left, and I won't... I hope people can relate to this? Or is that just me? xD<br />
<br />
Nice vid, though. Like the music. The accent of the narrator annoyed me a bit, had to watch the start of the vid twice to finally understand everything that was said. English is not my native tongue, however, so that mighta caused the confusion on my behalf.<br />
<br />
Ohhh and; Lol noob, you died... TWICE! lololol! --- Haha, no I joke. :P<br />

It's no different than buying a pack of cards from the trading card game in real life, getting a mount loot card, and selling the mount for gold in-game, which has been happening for six years. Stop making a big deal out of something that doesn't matter.</div></div><hr />
