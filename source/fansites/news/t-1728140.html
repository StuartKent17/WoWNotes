Silas Darkmoon claims to have spared no expense in finding the most wondrous wonders around as he presents the wonderful Darkmoon Faire. Beginning this Sunday, March 1, the Faire returns to Azeroth with a new racing series, new rewards and achievements, and a couple of updates to the games you’ve come to know and love.<br />
<br />
Off to the New Races<br />
Starting on March 1, the Darkmoon Faire will unveil the first part of a new racing challenge to thrill and delight players of all sorts.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/february/thumb/dmf01.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/february/dmf01.jpg) <br />
<br />
Win yourself the new Attraction Sign, and point it at your favorite things.<br />
<br />
Head down to the boardwalk and get started by accepting the quest ‘Welcome to the Darkmoon Races’. You’ll learn how to race all over the countryside around the Darkmoon Faire, avoiding obstacles and using any tools and tricks you can to finish the course in the fastest time possible.<br />
<br />
Only the quickest racers will qualify for the achievements and rewards that come with them. Along the way, you’ll want to use speed boosts, springboards, and a very careful aim all while avoiding boundaries which have been juiced up with a powerful stun.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/february/thumb/dmf02.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/february/dmf02.jpg) <br />
<br />
The Fire-Eater’s Vial is the perfect reward if you’ve always wanted to make fire with your face.<br />
<br />
This is but the first of several racing activities to come. When the Faire returns in April, a second race, new achievements, and associated rewards will be added to the first set. We expect Silas to keep adding twists and turns in future months until he has all of Azeroth running around his island:<br />
<br />
<br />
March: ‘The Real Race’, including the Racing Strider racer and a set of achievements with rewards.<br />
April: ‘The Real Big Race’, including a new Rocketeer racer, more boosts and race buffs, and new achievements for beating the The Real Big Race with both racers.<br />
May: A new Wanderluster racer, new achievements for beating both races with the Wanderluster, and rewards.<br />
June: A new Powermonger racer, new achievements for beating both races with the Powermonger, and rewards.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/february/thumb/dmf03.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/february/dmf03.jpg) <br />
<br />
That’s right, friends! The new Everlasting Darkmoon Firework can be yours.<br />
<br />
Updates are Best Dates<br />
From now on, the Tonk Commander game no longer has a maximum of 30 hits. You can now go for as many hits as possible in one minute, and scoring 45 hits earns you the ‘Ace Tonk Commander’ achievement and the new Darkmoon Tonk Controller toy.<br />
<br />
Ring Toss has also been updated. The target turtle has gotten trickier than he used to be, and the rings are smaller, but winning will just take some practice on your part. It might take a lot of practice, but you’ll want to give it a shot, since ten rings in a row earns you the new ‘Triumphant Turtle Tossing’ achievement and the Darkmoon Ring-Flinger toy. It’s an explosion of rings from your victorious hands.<br />
<br />
Don’t Forget the Heirlooms<br />
Silas asked us to remind everyone that beautiful selections of Heirloom items are available to make your very own, for only a few Darkmoon Prize Tickets each. With the introduction of the new Heirloom collection system in patch 6.1, there’s no reason to not come play the games of the Faire and get closer to earning yourself that Chauferred Chopper!<br />
<br />
Step right up! The next Darkmoon Faire runs March 1 – March 8, and will return again on April 5. For a general overview of this unique event, check out our Darkmoon Faire page (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/game/events/darkmoon-faire) in the World of Warcraft Game Guide (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/game/).<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 6.1 - Darkmoon Faire Changes<br />
Along with the addition of a race, there are a few other changes and additions to the faire:<br />
<br />
<br />
The ring toss game (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNcVSYxLyoc) was changed to reward (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/9894-triumphant-turtle-tossing) Darkmoon Ring-Flinger (http://www.wowdb.com/items/122123-darkmoon-ring-flinger). The game is now easy to do, as the turtle always runs back to the same spot in the center. Just wait for him to reach an edge and toss the ring at the center. <br />
The tonks game now rewards (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/9885-ace-tonk-commander) Darkmoon Tonk Controller (http://www.wowdb.com/items/122122-darkmoon-tonk-controller). This is very hard to complete if you are the only one playing, as there aren't enough targets. It is also hard to complete if there is any signficant lag.<br />
You can purchase heirlooms (http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-sold-currency=515&amp;filter-patch=19445&amp;filter-ilvl-min=85&amp;filter-ilvl-max=85), heirloom upgrades (http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-sold-currency=515&amp;filter-patch=19445&amp;filter-ilvl-min=90&amp;filter-ilvl-max=90), and a Music Roll: Darkmoon Carousel (http://www.wowdb.com/items/122238-music-roll-darkmoon-carousel) with Darkmoon Tickets.<br />

<br />
Patch 6.1 - Archaeology Progress Fix<br />
Hi everyone. We’ve just received an update from our development team informing us that this fix may not be applied to all affected players immediately after the launch of 6.1. We will be rolling it out gradually over time so that we can monitor results and ensure that everything is working as it should. So, if you’re still missing your progression when you login after patch 6.1, don’t panic! We haven’t forgotten about you and will be working to fix your affected characters as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your patience.<br />
<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
PvP<br />
Plz tell me (Horde) Ashran mid GY bug is fixed in 6.1. Corpse running constantly just to rez is REALLY annoying!<br />
Believe so. What have you experienced? (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/568630776209625088))<br />
it destroys forward progress.Has something to do with GY changing hands and/or going neutral.H &amp; A flags displayed 2.<br />
I know we tried to fix it. Have you seen it recently? (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/568659079020867584))<br />
<br />
2v2 is a lot more popular than 3v3, despite having basically no support from Blizzard.<br />
General trend that If an activity rewards the same gear but requires less people, it will be more popular. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/569181832278728704))<br />
That &quot;popularity&quot; doesn't mean it's a better experience. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/569182009005723648))<br />

Garrisons<br />
If I swap out Trade Post w/AH Bot for Inn, swap back later and rebuild to lvl 3, will I have to redo the AH Bot quest?<br />
You would not need to redo the quest. =) (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/568886176519557120))<br />
<br />
will you still get player kill credit for the nemesis quest line for glad sanctum when in a raid group in 6.1?<br />
.Yes, the Gladiator’s Sanctum quests are flagged to allow progress in a raid group. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/568925839426875393))<br />

Yeah but it's content, not old raids we have to re-run but NEW, exciting and fresh content where we all have been waiting for. Because we hadn't enough to do with the 6.1 release yet, they even give us more. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Neither. It's about those stupid people who drown their name in alt-code accented characters to fake the name they want instead of getting a name of their own using the 26 letters on a normal damn keyboard like everyone else.</div></div><hr />

Well, so, Square Enix has started re-releasing old content also. I'd say re-skinned 18 year old content isn't something new.</div></div><hr />

They have put two racing quest before this one, one in The Burning Crusade (from those orcs in Netherwing Ledge) and one in Mists of Pandaria (from the Order of the Cloud Serpent). Now, should we accuse Square Enix stealing ideas from Blizzard?</div></div><hr />

Well, chocobo racing is a FF7 (1997) minigame SQ's idea.... so... i dont get your point... and yeah, and to be honest, blizzard puting this racing content the<br />
same week that FF14arr, well that how the Old Blizzard guy works, but Gold Saucer Patch is way better than this silly 6.1 &quot;patch&quot;.</div></div><hr />

This is true, but anyone who soaks thier name in accented letters is clearly someone English. To anyone that actually uses those accented letters, it's just a pile of unpronouncible gibbersh.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Aladya: We exploited Iron Maidens so we never got the ship. This wasted an eternity. It was harder than doing it genuine and Blizzard fixed it anyway. So we had to do it normally and it just died.&quot;<br />

<br />
Or maybe it's the fact that most people who play only have one friend to play with. I know that is true for me. I have only one real friend who plays WoW and if we wanted to play 3v3 it would mean finding a totally random player who we don't know and communication would be harder. <br />
<br />
We are sitting next to each other in the same room and can see each others screens and talk easily, therefore we chose 2v2 and not 3v3. I am thinking that a lot of people are in the same situation. Not many people can fit 3 computers into the same room and TeamSpeak is something that not everyone has and also sometimes strangers are shy to speak into a mic.</div></div><hr />

Many have names available they just think the accented characters are cool.</div></div><hr />

It's about those stupid people who drown their name in alt-code accented characters to fake the name they want instead of getting a name of their own using the 26 letters on a normal damn keyboard like everyone else.<br />
<br />
So it is very hard to do anything with them if they don't talk in chat, because you don't know how to write these letters.</div></div><hr />

General trend that If an activity rewards the same gear but requires less people, it will be more popular. (holinka)<br />
That &quot;popularity&quot; doesn't mean it's a better experience.<br />
<br />
I find 2v2 a much better experience than 3v3. The fact that 2v2 rewards nothing and 3v3 / 5v5 are both horrible experiences is why I don't even bother with pvp anymore. It makes me sad, I wish they would just start giving 2v2 the same rewards again.</div></div><hr />
