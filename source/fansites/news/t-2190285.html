Yep WW was the worst not Balance druids who are 24/24 on all 3 mostly ST fights.... and Got their AOE slightly nerfed by starfall not scaling off haste anymore...<br />

Balance will be 24/24th class in 7.2... Guess we can hope for 7.2.5 or just all reroll.</div></div><hr />

Go to max, Balance is higher than WW. Obviously the majority of people don't play at &quot;max&quot; level, BUT that doesn't detract the fact that at max potential Balance isn't actually the lowest ST.</div></div><hr />

What, Monks? They got shit on this patch. Same place as Paladins, really. Good enough cleave, worthless in single target. I must admit I'm a little salty that Ret isn't getting a similar buff, although they kinda painted themselves into a corner WRT actually separating single target and AoE. Guess they could revert the unnecessary nerf to Crusade, but they would actually have to admit wrongdoing for that to occur... and it still leaves us with exactly one functional l100 talent choice.</div></div><hr />
