Cool. Seems like your statements all make sense in the real world of CC and burn single target to beat a timer vs AE stun that shit and burn it all quickly. Wonder which of these works and which doesn't.</div></div><hr />

It may lack features, like ranks and such, but it's really not crappy. It's used extensively in OW and is actually really good quality. So in a pug situation, like M+, I don't see a real reason not to use it.<br />

It's not bad, probably because Blizzard didn't actually make it lol</div></div><hr />

You seemed to miss the point of that question. They asked if blizzard was going to do any thing to make pugging better with how much you have to communicate. Blizzard has put a voice chat in that works perfectly fine other then that there is nothing they can really do to make little jimmy in a pug communicate.</div></div><hr />

Basically, we use that voicechat all the time in OW, it's quality is on par with Discord, not surprising since they outsourced it to a pretty big voip company.</div></div><hr />

Don't see how they could do much more then class based. But they could have things do different things based off spec, like the old Tier sets.</div></div><hr />

you are missing the point completly. <br />
<br />
people in game clearly do not want any form of communication to enjoy their content. <br />
<br />
which is why any form of chalenging content in game was always destined to fail. <br />
<br />
also which is why warfronts are so popular this expansion :)</div></div><hr />

No change whatsoever is coming before summer. This isn't a pivot, this is a &quot;sucks to suck&quot; type of announcement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Probably generic? We've seen how adamant they've been about respeccing and how *important* it is apparently to be required to do so now instead of things changing based on spec like they have for the last decade, so can't imagine they'd be spec based unless they want to upset people even more(or admit to being wrong for the first 6 months of a new expansion, also pissing off people).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
They're just kind of....floundering and look like they have no earthly idea what they're doing at this point. I've never actually considered cancelling my sub since I first subbed in Nov '04, but now there just seems like there's no point. They put all their eggs into the Azerite basket, and it's a thoroughly bad system. Removing all they did from classes at the end of Legion and doing nothing to really rectify this while also adding no concrete new abilities show they don't know what made the game fun from a leveling perspective either. Rewarding people in worse ways from content they did in Legion is kind of strike three...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I cringe at raid tiers being called &quot;seasons&quot; ugh. Just more of the one and done thing they are starting to suck at.<br />

They really used the 'small indy company' meme as an actual excuse...you can't make this stuff up. XD<br />

People made do with addons and macros. This was not an issue for the intelligent player. Also you could have implemented a system where people could switch &quot;styles&quot; so they could click a button and shift their action bars based on what they were doing: dungeons, raids, farming, etc.<br />

It was no longer clear what classes needed, as they had all of the tools they needed.<br />

There's always room for new and fun abilities...that much should be obvious.<br />

LOL you think?<br />

There are effectively 36 distinct classes. Years ago the specs weren't as different.<br />
<br />
Sorry, I'm going to call BS on this one. The specs were way less homogenized back in the day and it felt different because you could build them differently.<br />
<br />
<br />
The pruning was very controversial, so the team took a step back from that in Battle for Azeroth. They actually added a few things back. Currently the team doesn't think they need to simplify any more right now.<br />

I approve. Shifting more towards what was good about the Legion system. I was not engaged at all by azerite armor punishing you for upgrading gear by withdrawing several tiers of perks, that you then have to re-earn. Very poor design and makes gear progression not fun. I'm glad they are reworking this, even if it will likely bring back some of the pitfalls of the legion system (obsessive players that MUST HAVE IT ALL grinding themselves to dust instead of keeping to the pacing of the AP scaling)<br />
<br />
I wholeheartedly approve of what I see: They're taking in feedback and working on integrating it into the game, rather than taking the WOD method of giving up on the expansion entirely to work on the next one.</div></div><hr />

Yes because saying something about catchup makes me a &quot;millenial&quot;. Jesus christ.....<br />

It's a fucking common thing in MMOs these days. Of course if they do an item similar to the ring/cape it'll have catchup to help alts or those who fall behind.<br />

<br />
How does it not? The languages have never made sense in WoW, in every cinematic, Horde and Alliance characters can understand eachother. Magni talks to both. Clearly it is possible, and because they have no [Common] or [Orcish] in front of their text when they speak, obviously there's either some third language that's universally spoken by everyone, or everyone just understands Common and Orcish very well??<br />
<br />
Furthermore, in RP, your /e emotes are very important. Even if you couldn't understand someone through language, you can still do gestures, show emotions, facial expressions and all of that.<br />
<br />
I'm really puzzled by people screaming at the RP questions in general. How come the community that's so tightly-knit and more or less are the remaining communities left in game, is every time bombarded with awful comments such as 'go away!!! no one cares about rp!!!! RP LUL RP Kappa RP 4Head' etcetera. Even if you want to quit the game, let us live at the very least?<br />
<br />
Like, sure, you may not like it, but in a MMORPG game, you'd expect the RP community to be catered to at least somewhat, no? This was not an addon problem, the addon was a fix to a problem (cross faction communication) that 8.1 broke. And now Blizzard more or less solved the problem by adding in the potion. How is this hurting anyone? People cry it's bad priorities, but literally a hotfix to a problem is easier to do and universally easier to agree upon than class changes that require much more thought put into them.<br />
<br />
EDIT: This apparently is already in game, and does not work for emotes. So it's not even a good fix / the addon worked better, which is a shame. At least it's something, though!</div></div><hr />

Is that really a bad thing? Is it too much for a destro lock to toss out a corruption when they have to move? Or for a frost mage to finish off a target with a quick fire blast? I think it was a bad decision to effectively turn specs into classes. Specs should increase the damage of certain abilities over the others, but there's value to keeping the weaker ones in the spell book.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Possibly. Or, more than likely. Blizzard has nothing new and shiny to put on store shelves in 2019, just updates and patches to existing games, and two classic versions of old games, which may or may not sell a lot. Their stock price gut it's guts kicked out. Activision has had several large flops. <br />
<br />
There's a lot of other stuff going on, too, I'm sure. Blizzard was printing cash for years, and they may be seeing it dry up in a serious way for the first time, and are being told to stop wasting money for the first time, too. Valleyball courts and orc statues are fun, but when profits are down, the first cuts are always the perks. Then it's programs (hello HOTS). Will we see layoffs in 2019? We'll see. <br />
<br />
But I was just talking about the Q&amp;As, in context of just WoW. They're pointless, they're just ammo for the youtubers to get clicks. Maybe Ion sees them as a way to defuse the anger overall, but it's not really working out that way, it just gets people more upset. Brack, if he's an effective president, HAS to see that Ion's hamhanded attempts to placate an already upset customer base is just driving away subs, not retaining them.

You do know there's this thing called &quot;delegation&quot;. In no way is Ion getting bothered with &quot;should we fix this bug&quot;, &quot;should we nerf this mobs dmg by 10%&quot;. Fuck no, that's up to the dungeon lead. Ion approves things like, who goes into a raid as a boss, if HUGE class changes are needed, etc. He has a lot more to deal with the &quot;we're buffing aimed shot by 10%&quot; shit like that goes to the class leader.<br />
<br />
He had to approve of Azerite and a general proper range of AP gains. He doesn't approve of every source and how much you get from it.<br />

Gnome Warlock, &quot;Looking for 1 more need tank for Mythic Hold&quot;. <br />
Orc Monk, &quot;I'll go tank it for you little guy!!&quot; <br />
<br />
Something like that is coming. Many other MMOs out there allow for cross faction partying and communication.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Is that really a bad thing? Is it too much for a destro lock to toss out a corruption when they have to move? Or for a frost mage to finish off a target with a quick fire blast? I think it was a bad decision to effectively turn specs into classes. Specs should increase the damage of certain abilities over the others, but there's value to keeping the weaker ones in the spell book.<br />
<br />
An easy way to do this would be to give each class either a tank or healer spec if it doesn't have one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's purely for gameplay reasons that cross faction chat doesn't exist. Forsaken really shouldn't stop speaking common just cause they died. All elves should really be able to talk to each other. Our characters understand the other faction in cutscenes, etc. RPers set up a whole events around these facts, and it's especially important for them now seeing as this story is about horde vs. alliance.</div></div><hr />

They should really return to core classes design and just let us mix and match talents across all specializations. It seems like they were degrading wow year by year and now there is this mess. On one hand, they are overcomplicating systems and adding more stupid &quot;enter and leave&quot; systems into the game, while removing important parts of both MMO and RPG genre.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The team forgot to tell players about this at the start of Battle for Azeroth.<br />
<br />
They really beter have not forgotten to note that. If they have really forgotten to do that than that means they have HUGE management issues. If any competent person would lead the team of a multi-billion dollar company responsible for creating a MMO game that supposedly a few million people play on a daily basis and pay monthly fee to do so then they would probably do it this way:<br />
- Hey folks of Blizzard WoW team, you might be responsible for raid design, quest design, art design - whatever it is - whatever you do - you need to report any saved changes to this squad of guys/to this one guy who is responsible for creating our inside patch notes. You fix some bug? - Write a quick report to this guy what you've done.<br />
Then when the patch day comes we will take all those notes and compile it into public, outside patch notes (while maybe obscuring some stuff to keep it secret)! This way we can keep track of everything!<br />
<br />
IRL Ion says: &quot;WE FORGOT SOZ GUYS&quot;. This means they either don't keep a record of what they do or they do keep track but do not care to review it every few months when they fucking release these patches. I don't know what is worse.<br />
<br />
<br />
They are fucking pathetic. Blizzard is either absolutely 100% cynical and lying in these matters or Ion is absolutely the worst game developer leader in the world. Can we get rid of this lawyer finally?</div></div><hr />

His obfuscating way of talking is good for leading juries in courtrooms, but it stinks on ice for customers who want to know why he and his team are so incompetent, and want some hope for the future and their $15 a month.<br />
<br />
They don't have to fire Ion (although i think it's inevitable at this point), but shut him up. He's not accomplishing anything here. <br />

Lore needs to go work in a surf shop in Seal Beach, where he can pretend his perm is still cool, brah, and he can call the tourists who buy SexWax and overpriced t-shirts &quot;douchebags&quot; to his heart's content.<br />

Poor Ion has aged like 10-15 years in the last ~3 years.<br />

I wonder if they keep track on Q&amp;A reception in the community, or whether they care. This is indeed painful to watch. :(<br />
<br />
Also, love how they had 3 months to think about the azerite armor, decided to continue with it despite the players hating it, and only really care about it in 8.2, when the resource put into it is 100000% &quot;consumed&quot;. That's just heartbreaking.</div></div><hr />

Ion just get's blamed because he's the mouthpiece, if it wasn't him it would be someone else. And he's not really the head of it, he's still got bosses, if you really want to blame someone, blame J. Allen Brack, he was executive producer going into BfA, or blame whoever is taking his spot. Blame Mike because he was the President and CEO going into BfA. Blame Bobby because he is the one making them cater to MAU's. But really no, not everything is on Ion, it's on the team as a whole.</div></div><hr />

I agree up to a point. However, Bobby Kotick doesn't give a shit HOW the dev team generates their MAUs or the player engagement or how they monetize people via the cash shop, just that they do it.<br />
<br />
There are many, many paths to getting players to spend time in a game and probably the best reason would be that they are having so much fun they lose track of time. Apparently these devs have little to no confidence that they can in fact make content that is fun and so they just make content in such a way that time inputs are mandatory to access the parts of the game where they hold a competitive advantage. <br />
<br />
If gameplay was fun then they wouldn't have to participation gate everything and steal tiny bits of player time for no design reason other than if we make this take 5 seconds longer and that take 10 seconds longer for no reason, if you multiply that times millions of players doing it then you got some real &quot;engagement&quot; going on.<br />
<br />
It's just sad to watch. Probably if they spent half the time they spend fretting about players doing something out of the box or thinking up cute ways to waste 10 to 15 seconds times millions here or there they could probably produce more players playing more and playing longer. They don't even have to think up anything new - they've tossed the fucking baby out with the bathwater enough times by now that they could just find the good shit they tossed and bring it back and never think up a single new thing. (other than of course flying foxes etc for $25.00)</div></div><hr />

Problem is they have to create the maus in the cheapest way possible. Something that takes a lot of time or money (like something hard to balance) won't fly. And on top of that you don't want to try something too new (or too old) because, like ea rushing far too many games or killing things before they even started picking up (RIP warhammer), Bobby could just end it if he felt like it<br />
<br />
They've made cost cutting measures and its starting to backfire, thankfully they're backtracking on some of them now. It's like blizzards motto is... it's too hard to balance</div></div><hr />

Made absolutely nothing up, this is what happens when a game company is headed by someone who wants to take the fun out of making games.<br />
<br />
And in case you're too lazy to find it yourself:<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think it is specific to video games. I think that if you look at how much volatility there is in the economy and, dependent upon your view about macroeconomic picture and I think we have a real culture of thrift. And I think the goal that I had in bringing a lot of the packaged goods folks that we brought in to Activision 10 years ago was to take all the fun out of making video games.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we definitely have been able to instill the culture, the skepticism and pessimism and fear that you should have in an economy like we are in today. And so, while generally people talk about the recession, we are pretty good at keeping people focused on the deep depression.&quot;</div></div><hr />

the problem is not ion. it is the management and the marketing that controls what he can say and what not and that allow or disallow the apropriate questions. these questions are sorted out by marketing. and even this ppl seem not getting (guy in page 1 that asking which idiots asked that questions, lol).<br />
<br />
most ppl forget what we can have INSTEAD ion. if you change ion, the outcomings would be the same. you still will be get a pushed up version from marketing of a greedy multi billion dollar company. you still will not get the info you want. but this time it is presented as „eat or die“. hard facts. baam. here you have it. with no background explanation of why and how. <br />
<br />
ppl should get back tom chilton or a new guy just for one week. hell, they would cry for ion to come back.<br />
<br />
or in short: you are barking at the wrong tree. it is not an ion problem (that is just the face you see), it is a actvision blizzard problem.<br />

I really dislike Lore on these. He’s unprofessional, dresses like a teenage kid, and can barely speak (fumbles over questions, names, seems to be limited on vocab etc), and repeats himself far too often: ‘that makes sense’. Can they at least try rotating people around, and maybe someone more lively? Like who wears a hoodie with the hood up and a hat on at the same time in a professional company, not to mind a broadcast. You can still look respectful and wear blizzard clothing without looking like a kid. He’s a manager, not an intern, act like one. Ion tries to do a good job as always, but anytime I hear Lore in these I just zone out.<br />
<br />
<br />
the „that makes sense“ thing is the same like the „thats awesome“ thing at apple or microsoft speaks. they are trained to tattoo in visiters brains that its good, by repeating it endlessly.<br />
<br />
or in short: thats shit marketing stuff of giant companies. not a lore thing.</div></div><hr />

And what can we conclude from all of these Q&amp;A's combined together? That they hear us? That they're looking into it but not for this patch? That &quot;in the long term, it will be fine&quot;?<br />

It's the same riddle every single time, he talks a lot but says very little. Even if he's a mere messenger, he's a horrible one. I'd rather have a person who is a good speaker convey these pre-scripted messages than this monotone machine.</div></div><hr />

He's tanking whole WoW dev team. Forum hate is loud, but mostly mindless. If team would put janitor in these Q&amp;As, they would think that janitor is source of all problems.<br />
<br />
For example, I saw many post from people who thought that Ghostcrawler was better game director and he got too much hate. But he was NEVER game director, he just interacted with community the most.<br />
<br />
I like that Ion take more reponsibility than Chilton, who just send people like Cory Stockton to do interviews, so hate was focused on them.</div></div><hr />

I would think nobody &quot;above him&quot; there is to spend sleepless nights thinking what to do with wow, and how to direct the game director to make him do those ideas, that's literally Ion's and his team's job. Hence Game Director. <br />

It's likely the team will use the vendor to allow you to target more right before the expansion is over so players that are missing a few items can get them.<br />
<br />
Good god this level of stupidity.<br />
<br />
How about instead, you keep islands relevent into the next expac similar to how proving grounds work. That will give people that like them something to do anytime they feel like it AND you won't depreciate the effort of every player that actually put work into getting the items during the expansion. <br />
<br />
This fucking obsession with nerfing everything as the expac goes on so that every special princess gets a pony is crazy. They neuter their own content, depreciate the value of things people have worked on, and further propagate the view that you may as well not doing things now since they'll just become easier if you wait.<br />
<br />
This kind of comment literally feels like it sums up all the stupid mistakes they just keep making over and over again.<br />
<br />
Please put some real gamers in charge of WoW again ffs.</div></div><hr />

The team didn't mean to break the addon, but can't restore the functionality.<br />
This was a quick change that wasn't fully thought out on the team's part. It was hotfixed in at the start of the season.<br />
The team forgot to tell players about this at the start of Battle for Azeroth.<br />
The team is never truly satisfied with the state of class design.<br />
It's hard to keep every spec unique.<br />
<br />

Nice try, next time watch the Q/A.</div></div><hr />

you just expect too much. development takes time. they do more often QnAs than they have to say something. its a marketing mechanism to show players: we are here. thats all. yes, ion talk a lot and say just a little. because there is just a little. the guy you wish would come on stage, tell you the hard facts in 2min without context and leave. is this better ? no clue. but i am sure as hell, ppl would even more complain about that. because facts i can also read in text notes. ion at least delivers context.<br />
<br />
maybe ppl expect too much, what can happen in 4 weeks in a game like wow...<br />

<br />
yep. ofc sheep almost hate the face they present to them to transmit the message. <br />
<br />
chilton and stockton both were horrible imo. greg street was ok, since he also at least tried to give context and tried hard that ppl understand whats behind. sometimes too hard for my taste. all in all ion at least give context.<br />
<br />
in the end its not ion. its not the wow team. its the management and the will of the share holders that dictate the direction and foremost give ion a budget of x. imo the wow just tries to make the best they can out of a mid range budget.<br />
<br />
a game director that played that much wow like ion has, ofc has A LOT of ideas what can be done with wow. but in the end, he have to serve the customers, the shareholders and have to get all together in a giant monotlith wow is.<br />
<br />
maybe some ppl could do it better. but i am sure as hell, there are also a lot, that can do it worse.<br />

Ion as a GAME DIRECTOR has the most saying as to where the game goes. It literally means he directs the game to where it will go.<br />
So when someone (I wonder who came up with that, amongst many decisions in the past 5-6 years...) came up with the azerite armor concept, he had to say the last word as in &quot;yay&quot; or &quot;nay&quot;. And he said yay. Someone said &quot;yay&quot; to legendaries in Legion, and professions and reputations and islands too. Who do you think it was?<br />

<br />
<br />
do you ever have worked in a giant company like blizz. seems like not. you forget that small word called budget. why he said yai to azerite ? because its cheap.<br />
<br />
ppl have no clue what cost effective development means these days. i am a software dev since 20 years, so i at least know how things go. and imo some kiddy ppl here have completely no clue how the business world ticks and have completely no clue what they even talk about. a LOT of BS here. i fear of eye and brain cancer here..<br />
<br />

<br />
just to add: i am not happy with a lot of things in BfA too. but this doesnt mean i am too stupid to have some reality check. if i no longer like for what i pay, i stop paying 15 bugs a month. simple as that.</div></div><hr />

I've been saying the same thing about the budget stuff for a long time now. And I'm not some kiddy. Nevertheless, it doesn't work, does it? Players simply don't like it, and the relief only comes in ~5-6 months. There are contious bad decisions regards the game. We are mostly talking simple decisions here &quot;will the players like it or not&quot; type of things. They are completely disconnected from the playerbase, so the budget stuff doesn't even apply here, wow can be the cheapest game if players don't like it and don't play it because it's that bad.</div></div><hr />

That was the biggest load of bs. BFA was the worst pruning to date.<br />

What is it that they pruned away in BfA in those major ways that its the worst in the games history?<br />

I mean you are quoting the guy who thinks firing Ion will solve everything.<br />
<br />
Rationality isn't their strong suit. :) Or knowledge of industries/business for that matter.<br />
<br />
Seems to me we have had this before, where people cry about the Game Director/Lead Designer endlessly and want him removed. And when he quits/is removed a while after they be like &quot;Those were the days wish we could have him back&quot;<br />
<br />

just seems like someone who can reason, to me<br />

Well it seems all he got to attack him is to insinuate that he is gay as if that have anything to do with anything. Also the sad personal attacks on Lore´s appearance is telling aswell.</div></div><hr />
