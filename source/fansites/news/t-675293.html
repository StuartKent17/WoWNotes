Patch 3.3 PTR Notes Update - 10/23<br />
General<br />
Character Creation: The descriptions for races, classes, and race/class combinations have been improved to provide new players with a better idea of the roles and advantages of each class and race. <br />
Knockbacks no longer dismount players. If on a flying mount, you will be knocked back a short distance before being able to resume flying. <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid <br />
Balance<br />
Force of Nature: Health on the treants has been increased.<br />
Feral<br />
Predatory Strikes: The Predatory Swiftness buff from this talent now has a 5-second duration.<br />
Restoration<br />
Gift of the Earthmother: Redesigned. This talent now increases spell haste and reduces the base global cooldown by 2/4/6/8/10% instead of its previous effect.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage <br />
Mirror Image: Health on the mirror images has been increased. <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin<br />
Protection<br />
Divine Sacrifice: Redesigned. The effect of Divine Sacrifice is now party-only and the maximum damage which can be transferred is now limited to 40% of the paladin’s health multiplied by the number of party members. In addition, the bug which allowed Divine Sacrifice to sometimes persist despite reaching its maximum damage has been fixed. Divine Sacrifice will now cancel as soon as its maximum damage value is exceeded in all cases. Finally, damage which reduces the paladin’s health below 20% now cancels the effect early.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue<br />
Vanish: For the first half second after this ability is used, neither Vanish nor Stealth can be broken by taking damage or being the victim of a hostile spell or ability. (Change Reverted)<br />
<br />
User Interface<br />
Many of the default Interface Options settings have been changed for greater ease of use by new players. Existing players who create new characters may want to review the Interface Options in the event that the default settings feel different. <br />
Buffs and Debuffs: This is a new section added to Interface Options.<br />
New option - Castable Debuffs: Enabling this will cause only debuffs you have cast on an enemy target to appear.<br />
New option - Consolidate Buffs: Enabling this adds a buff consolidation box near the mini-map. Very short term buffs (e.g. Replenishment) and very long term buffs (e.g. Prayer of Fortitude) are filtered into the buff box. The icons are stacked here, but they can still be seen by moving the mouse cursor over the buff box. Long term buffs will move out of the box when they are about to expire. Buffs such as important procs (e.g. Art of War, Lightning Overload), cooldowns (e.g. Bloodlust / Heroism, Combustion) or limited in range (e.g. totems and paladin auras) are always displayed.<br />
Tutorial System: The tutorial pop-ups are now larger, contain images, and better try to direct players to the relevant locations or user interface elements on the screen. In addition, several new tips have been added, while some existing tips will now appear at more appropriate times for new players. <br />
Dungeon &amp; Raid Difficult Display: A group’s dungeon or raid difficulty setting will now be displayed via an icon off of the mini-map. <br />
Group Disenchanting Option: In addition to rolling “Need” or “Greed” on items, players now have the option to elect for an item to be disenchanted. “Disenchant” works exactly like “Greed” except if a player wins the “Greed” roll, they will receive the disenchanted materials instead. Players who choose “Need” will always win the item and will always beat those that choose “Greed” or “Disenchant.” <br />
Lag Reports: Players can now report high latency or lag by accessing the Help Request menu. <br />
<br />
Professions<br />
Fishing<br />
The all-new Kalu’ak Fishing Derby, a test of fishing skill with a healthy dash of luck, has come to Northrend! Every Wednesday beginning at 8 PM players can try to catch the elusive Blacktip Shark. Elder Clearwater sits in Dalaran for one hour awaiting the return of the quickest, most experienced fisher to bring him this shark. This champion fisher will be rewarded in-kind for returning with the first catch. Those who aren’t able to return with the first catch will still receive just reward for getting the Blacktip Shark to Elder Clearwater before he takes his leave. It is said that these sharks’ favorite meal are the bite-sized Pygmy Suckerfish. Perhaps a hook in their waters will do the trick.<br />
<br />
Achievements<br />
The Achievements to get exalted with the Warsong Gulch, Arathi Basin, and Alterac Valley factions have been removed from their respective “Master of” Meta-Achievements. Special titles will be offered to those who reach exalted with these factions.<br />
“The Party’s Over” has been removed from Achievements and is no longer a part of the “Glory of the Hero” Meta-Achievement.<br />
“Master Angler of Stranglethorn” has been changed to “Master Angler of Azeroth” and can be achieved by winning either the Kalu'ak Fishing Derby or the Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza.<br />
<br />
Items<br />
Arena Set Bonuses: The two-piece set bonus for all Wrath of the Lich King Arena sets now provides 100 resilience and 29 spell power or 50 attack power. The current four-piece bonus will remain, however it also now provides 88 spell power or 150 attack power. <br />
Shaman Tier-9 4-Piece Set Bonus (Elemental): This set bonus now places a damage-over-time effect on the target when Lava Burst deals damage instead of increasing the size of the Lava Burst.</div></div><hr />

I am sooo happy about it. More resilence, for getting started earlier. Bonus stats for those who are new, gives us old hands some nice incentivies. I realize pvp is already stupidly op, but this will REALLY help make the pvp gear that much more. Plus give new players a chance to start. I mean its almost required now, but hopefully they'll fix the initial honor farm somehow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That list of buffs/nerfs may have been useful if it wasn't obviously written by a bias rogue. I mean seriously, the smallest of changes that have anything to do with stealth / stuns are all listed as nerfs while the majority of buffs are listed as fixes/changes.<br />
<br />
Ex:<br />
N: Sitting characters will now stand up immediately after an attack, even if stunned.<br />
N: Patrolling scouts that can see through stealth and invisibility have been added to Darnassus, Stormwind City, Undercity and Thunder Bluff.<br />
<br />
F: Vanish - Should be a lot more responsive when used to avoid incoming attacks.<br />
F: It will no longer be possible to swap any equipment while stunned.<br />
<br />
And even allowing for these &quot;mistakes&quot; the count after 3.0 is<br />
<br />
B: 30<br />
N: 19<br />
F: 32<br />
<br />
Even without knowing that a lot of these &quot;Fixes&quot; are buffs and that the &quot;Nerfs&quot; are not always rogue specific (Ex: the armor pen. change is listed as a nerf to rogues) your argument still fails.

I don't think anyone was denying that rogues have been nerfed before. The only reason I even bothered to reply was that your post came off as overly hostile to me.

It really has nothing at all to do with you being a rogue.<br />
<br />
Well with that out of the way, I'm glad you got your point across. Also, obligatory &quot;OMG Shadowmourne proc is OP/Sucks&quot; as well as a thumbs up for the other weapon procs.<br />
<br />
Edit: Why do the majority of rogues who reply personally attack the people saying they deserved the nerf, can't they just take it as someones opinion and move on. Someone making a negative comment about your class is no reason to attack them, maybe you should just respond by commenting on their class. Ex: &quot;You're just made because rogues are a counter to &lt;class&gt;&quot;, or anything other than &quot;Ur Bad LOL l2p scrub, go diaf&quot;. Do you see the difference?</div></div><hr />

They're not buffs... you just don't understand mages correctly.<br />

1. The Frozen Core change is a nerf. PvP mages would get 1 second frostbolts after an ice lance critted on the PTR. Now they don't. This is a nerf.<br />
2. The Deep Freeze change only applies to PvE for raid bosses. It will continue not to do damage in PvP.<br />

<br />
The Armor Pen. change was a nerf to multiple classes, it was not directed solely at rogues that was the point. And yes I understand the Fixes makes the rogue through fixing an ability, but they should have been listed as F/B like multiple fixes were labeled as F/N. (And a few were already listed this way, just not the majority of times it happened). <br />
<br />
I really have no argument with rogues here, yes you have been nerfed and buffed just like every class in the game, that doesn't give you reason to insult people who agree/disagree with these changes. It's the same for every class in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You cant just list a Buff/Nerf list, then count them up, and then say N &gt; B, so rogues are terrible<br />
<br />
here's some things to consider that the list doesnt bother to bring up (in its infinite bias):<br />
* Base mechanics can benefit classes and play styles, such as scaling issues or small latencies. A buff/nerf list doesnt take this into account <br />
* If a rogue is doing bad against class X, and class X gets nerfed while the rogue gets nerfed, the outcome CAN be positive for the rogue<br />
* This is largely a PVP discussion is my mine (as thats where I see the vanish change/revert having the largest affect). If rogues received a million nerfs, but still were good in arenas, then would it matter much if they got nerfed a million times? No, because they are still good, which leads me to ... at what points in this game have rogues been terrible in 2s/3s (the most popular brackets). I personally can't think of a time, but I can name classes in seasons that have been on the absolute shit list.<br />
<br />
<br />
This post isnt about rogues being awesome/terrible, or me hating them. The simple fact is everyone QQs about seeing a nerf and never about the big picture. Rogues still do exceptionally well in arenas, and will continue most likely in 3.3. I realize that having a bugged talent sucks (I played mage for a long time, and blink fucking up pisses me off), but sometimes you have to realize that if a fix buffs a certain class, and you don't want to buff that class, you either have to revert the fix or nerf them, and this is while you don't affect pvp/pve while fixing pve/pvp. That immunity could be used largely to the rogues advantage to avoid large nukes, and that has to be taken into account.</div></div><hr />

I don't know about you guys, but if this makes it to live i sure as hell won't be risking my repairs on it.<br />

On my server pugs fail unless you gear and achievement check every single person. You don't take people unless you know them or have heard from someone who does know them, or check their gear first hand. So this cross-server raid LFG is gonna put 24 random people who you haven't checked, into a raid together, with you, and you're going to magically get the bosses down. Good luck to anyone attempting to use it. I'll stick to painstakingly checking gear outside Dalaran bank, and I'll get the bosses down eventually.</div></div><hr />

I immediately thought that the missing throne texture made it impossible to know just how big the room is supposed to be, and proposed something like this: http://imgur.com/jDNZZ.png<br />
<br />
The build today introduced a slightly different room (which is undoubtedly a work in progress) that looks like this: http://imgur.com/GjHMU.png<br />

No, I wont use it to save myself to some fail players' ID. Howerver, LF raid available means I can now raid with my friend from other realms, similar to how LFG will work in 3.3. This is good news. <br />
<br />
A question, as it seems noone ever raise it up: am I able to look for group region-wide (EU/US/Oceanic) or just battle-group wide? What happens if my friends are on realms belonging to different battle group as mine?</div></div><hr />

this is going to make no diference at all any shards or crystals that coe from a dungeon atm are rolled for at the end and any green/blues that drop are greeded on atm and who ever wins them are going to go and get a enchanter in there guild to disenchant them for them (i do it all the time for my guild mates). so either way there going to get there &quot;free mats&quot;. but if you want to cut your wrists go ahead im sure the world will keep spinning with one less emo twat crying in it</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Acctually you will only beable to find groups on your battlegroup. A while back they said when first mentioned cross realm groups was the same technology that would allow them to bring more servers up for the instance full was the same technology used to get groups going. This also can be seen in the battlegrounds. HOWEVER<br />
<br />
Concurrently you can only find random groups. However they did say you could form a group of your friends(same realm) and que for a random dungeon and get the daily like reward if you want. This probably won't count towards your achievemnet, but its still nice to group with friends.<br />
<br />
In the future with all the they want to do to Battlenet and cross realm chat and the chat interface I would suspect a cross game feature might be coming soon, for your battlenet friends.</div></div><hr />

Interesting... the HoT on the healer weapons seems a bit weak though. Sure it's an aoe heal but as a paladin that normally heals the MT I'd prefer something similar to the HL glyph, and by that I mean the target gets healed for a larger amount and everyone around him gets healed for a smaller amount.<br />
<br />
P.S. <br />

<br />
<br />
Even with the Ice Lance change frost was still poor in DPS. It was a step in the right direction, don't get me wrong... I mean, I would love frost to be PvE viable, but even if this change had stayed it still wouldn't be enough. The change to Deep Freeze isn't exactly great either. I mean, it's about an 8hit-14k crit spell, with a 30 second cooldown, and requires a Fingers of Frost proc. I'm glad that they're giving frost some attention and at least trying things out, but these changes just don't help quite enough. I haven't had a chance to test out the permanent water elemental because the glyph hasn't been on the PTR yet, but when he is up he's doing about 500dps. That puts every frost spec and rotation I've tried so far AT LEAST 500dps behind a fire or arcane build. Now, if you absolutely love frost and want nothing to do with fire or arcane, I'm sure you could raid with it, just don't expect to be topping any meters ever again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. The Frozen Core change is a nerf. PvP mages would get 1 second frostbolts after an ice lance critted on the PTR. Now they don't. This is a nerf.<br />
2. The Deep Freeze change only applies to PvE for raid bosses. It will continue not to do damage in PvP.<br />
3. The Mirror Image change is to compensate for the fact pets don't get AoE avoidance in PvP any more. You can't AoE images down on live because they have high avoidance. No they don't, but have high health instead.<br />
<br />
None of them are making mages OP.<br />
<br />
wouldnt deep freeze do damage in pvp to a player if it or kidney put the effect on DR? how do you get that its &quot;only&quot; for boss's? Since they nerfed frozen core before it even went live why would anyone go frost for pve now? its dead before it got released, the frozen core buff would make lancing on the second charge of fingers of frost viable and raise frost dps (probably still a good 10-15% behind arcane) but maybe viable for the 5% crit debuff to the raid and the extra replenishment if you needed those, again with the frozen core nerf, poof its gone, there is no frost pve, so the buff to deep freeze is strictly a pvp buff.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, your mats don't drop off mobs generally, apart from greens+. But you have a profession that's really in demand and may have one of the largest profit margins in game. People always want your abilities! Sure, no more purchasing mats from you, but is that a bad thing? Really? You'll be able to keep a larger reserve for yourself and guildies, and you won't (as much) have to deal with people who &quot;forgot&quot; to buy mats.<br />

<br />
The only real difference is BoP blues/purples, but I have never been in any group that automatically passed on all these items so the enchanter could have items to sell.<br />
<br />
It should bring enchanting mats down to a more reasonable price.<br />
<br />
So why not leather, or herbs, or ore? All the professions that use these items require a secondary profession to gather the necessary materials. In ADDITION to making a killing on enchanting mats, you guys were also miners, herbalists, skinners, etc.<br />
<br />
A JCer won't auto prospect because he needs to either buy his ore or level mining. Same with scribes and milling. When mobs begin dropping ore and herbs, the point will be worth considering.<br />
<br />
Tailors get their mats in a similar way, but what do you want? Auto bolts? <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the point has to be made that although enchanters are responsible for the supply of enchanting materials, enchanting materials are not exclusive to you. Other professions need them too, especially tailors.</div></div><hr />

Enchant rings is a moot point since every profession is equal in that sense. So you are saying that enchanting should just be taken for granted and made to convenience everyone? I return to my previous statement of why be an enchanter when you don't need to be on to DE anything.<br />

Name the largest profit margin for me please. There are people who refuse to pay gold when an enchanter does the enchant and will wait to find someone who will do it for free. Enchanting has the smallest profit margin by far. Disenchanting items is what gives enchanters money and if the game starts doing that automatically for everyone enchanters lose that. Also not everyone keeps reserves of mats on hand to deal with people who forgot so that is a baseless arguement. All this is doing is bringing the prices of mats down by removing the need to actually be an enchanter to create them. What is the point of being able to disenchant item when by process of a built in game mechanic anyone can do it?</div></div><hr />

Happens with every profession - if a guild is barely worth the name, it'll have at least one person with every profession that will do things for free for their guildmates. Enchanting, cut jewels, craft items, brew flasks, you name it.<br />
<br />
Second, the profit margin on DEing blue items instead of just vendoring them is rather small, if at all. In our server we (our guild) don't bother with it when running heroics, even if we have a DEr - the vendor value of blues is greater than the cost of a shard.<br />
<br />
Third, if you depend on DEing randomly dropped greens for a living, you're doing it wrong. Se the guides on this very page about how to make a fuckton of enchanting materias with cheap AH materials. I confess I didn't know about that until the day Boub published his guide, and with very little time investment I've made 20k gold in these 4 weeks. I'm sure there are people who earns that (or will brag they do) every day, but 20k is sure enough for me for a couple expansions.<br />
<br />
Fourth, the DEing button may appear only for enchanters. Anyone playing the PTR can confirm or deny that?</div></div><hr />

Theres no way to respond to the first because its the truth.<br />
<br />
Second thats server dependant. Your average blue item will vend for 5-10g so if dream shards cost less than that there may be something very screwed up with your servers economy that adding more dream shards (DE without an enchanter) isn't going to do anything but make worse.<br />
<br />
Third yes we all love Boub for pointing out ways people have been making money by learning their professions so no one has to learn for themselves. I am ever so grateful for that. /s<br />

<br />
crossed fingers...will be great!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gawek</div><div class="date">2009-10-24, 10:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In previous 3.3 PTR patch notes, we've seen:<br />
<br />
<br />
* Divine Guardian: This talent no longer increases the amount of damage transferred to the paladin from Divine Sacrifice. Instead it causes all raid and party members to take 10/20% reduced damage while Divine Sacrifice is active.<br />
* Divine Sacrifice: Redesigned. The effect of Divine Sacrifice is now party-only and the maximum damage which can be transferred is now limited to 40% of the paladin’s health multiplied by the number of party members. In addition, the damage transferred to the paladin is now reduced by 50% before being applied to the paladin. Finally, the bug which allowed Divine Sacrifice to sometimes persist despite reaching its maximum damage has been fixed. Divine Sacrifice will now cancel as soon as its maximum damage value is exceeded in all cases.<br />
<br />
Now, both of these are decent changes that I don't mind. The changes to get rid of Bubble-Saccing is not a big deal in my opinion. This will allow us to use it every 2 minutes, instead of every 5. But, I saw in the latest patch notes a couple changes to the Divine Sacrifice changes:<br />
<br />
<br />
Divine Sacrifice: Redesigned. The effect of Divine Sacrifice is now party-only and the maximum damage which can be transferred is now limited to 40% of the paladin’s health multiplied by the number of party members. In addition, the bug which allowed Divine Sacrifice to sometimes persist despite reaching its maximum damage has been fixed. Divine Sacrifice will now cancel as soon as its maximum damage value is exceeded in all cases. Finally, damage which reduces the paladin’s health below 20% now cancels the effect early.<br />
<br />
Now, I like the idea that damage that reduces a Paladin below 20% health will immediately cancel the effect. That is nice, so you don't have to worry about killing yourself when using DSac. You can use it more freely, and not worry that you are going to become roadkill if you don't heal yourself fulltime while it's up. But I notice that the <br />
In addition, the damage transferred to the paladin is now reduced by 50% before being applied to the paladin. is now missing from the redesigned Divine Sacrifice. Now, I hope this is just an oversight because that 50% damage reduction is a huge deal for the new Divine Sacrifice. If you don't have 50% damage reduction anymore, you are still going to have to heal yourself fulltime to keep the DSac from going off extremely early. With a 50% damage reduction, you can still afford to heal others with minor HoTs or low heals on yourself. I hope this is just an oversight, and I hope somebody is playing on the PTR and has tested this out.<br />

<br />
Well, in my case I was a firm believer in Adam Smith's theories and, seeing how in my server the cost of reagent for flasks and crafted items is greater than the flask and crafted item itself, and the cost of a cut gem is only slightly greater than the uncut one I didn't bother researching further. So it was a surprise when I found about the JC-DEing stuff, and found other ways myself. Turned out that the theory's &quot;informed customer&quot; part doesn't apply to WoW economy.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I my point is that I highy doubt there'll be a large influx of enchanting reagents with the new patch or that anyone will become self-sufficient just by the random DEing of heroics' random greens. Which means you (and I) won't be seeing a large infux of said materials to the AH or a large drop in demand, seeing how you can make a ton of those with some gems and cristalized earth that routinely appear in the AH at hilarious prices. So at this point you're IMHO complaining that it'll take you 23 days to make enough money to buy motorbikes for your two alts instead of 20, which honestly doesn't look that painful.</div></div><hr />

Since they nerfed frozen core before it even went live why would anyone go frost for pve now? its dead before it got released, the frozen core buff would make lancing on the second charge of fingers of frost viable and raise frost dps (probably still a good 10-15% behind arcane) but maybe viable for the 5% crit debuff to the raid and the extra replenishment if you needed those, again with the frozen core nerf, poof its gone, there is no frost pve, so the buff to deep freeze is strictly a pvp buff.<br />
<br />
No.<br />
<br />
Deep Freeze only damages targets who are PERMANENTLY immune to stuns. PvP players are never permanently immune, only temporarily. This doesn't affect PvP in any way whatsoever. It does however affect PvE, even if it's only a very small buff (Deep Freeze crits for 20k+ in PvE).</div></div><hr />

If this just starts handing out disenchants with the enchanter even getting a say then whats the point of being an enchanter. I might as well pick up JC or something so people don't profit off my profession.<br />
<br />
And yes you can say I am being greedy by not disenchanting for everyone but what purpose does it serve? Am I supposed to provide free services to everyone in the game regardless of how it affects me?<br />
<br />
<br />
I still don't see the problem, your logic is flawed. Hello, are you even THINKING? Lets say you are in a dungeon. EVERYONE is rolling on that same thing. You rolled a 35 someone rolled a 99. They get the item, they are going to run out and get it DE'd form themselves so THEY have the mats. <br />
<br />
Now with this in place, AND THE SAME deal. You rolled a 35 he rolled a 99. Oh what's this. GASP He STILL GOT HIS MATS only he didn't need to run to someone else to get it done for him. It doesn't matter if the ****ed thing disenchants or not, the winner of the roll is STILL getting the item, it just saves a step in the breaking down process. Maybe if you weren't being so friggen greedy and lost the attitude you MIGHT have solved that one your self Sherlock. =_=' ::)</div></div><hr />

3) If the process doesn't require a enchanter is this option only usable in dungeons / raids or is it any group where there is a party? What I'm trying to ask is, can two non chanters party up and grind mobs and greed to DE drops, effectively farming chanting mats?<br />
<br />
Personally as an enchanter I am insulted by this change. Sure enchanting was a good money maker but so is herbalism, mining, JC are we going to see those professions changed so that their crafted mats are more available to people too lazy to farm. Giving people who don't have the profession and haven't worked to gain that skill (despite having the choice to lvl chanting and opting to some other skill) the same benefit is unfair, need chanting mats make a chanter friend and get him to DE the stuff for you. Need shards / abyss crystals, sorry but either find a chanter to dungeon with or buy em you don't expect arctic furs and frost lotus handed to you why do you expect to be given top end chanting mats.<br />

2) If there the process requires an enchanter does he have any choice in the matter? I mean if he doesn't want to hand out mats to others can he select an option not to DE for party?<br />
how it works is like this: An item drops. <br />
You need it for equipping -&gt; need<br />
You need it for offspec -&gt; greed<br />
You only care about the mats -&gt; enchant<br />
so basically in a heroic dungeon with everyone geared up, every one only rolls enchant because they need mats. <br />
Then you see the loot details, as I said, everyone rolls disenchant, winner instantly gets the mats without being an enchanter.<br />
<br />
3) If the process doesn't require a enchanter is this option only usable in dungeons / raids or is it any group where there is a party? What I'm trying to ask is, can two non chanters party up and grind mobs and greed to DE drops, effectively farming chanting mats?<br />
depends on if you need an enchanter in order for this tool to work<br />

yea well nothin really has changed except for the fact that now the item gets always disenchanted, and no one throws their blue/green gear away after. <br />
But the disenchanter still needs to win the roll in order to get mats.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
right now I could think of two flaws with this system:<br />
-) everyone naturally hits enchant, but since you are the enchanter you roll greed, therefore get the unenchanted item, which you can disenchant afterwards, ie you are fucking over your group by hitting need, winning instantly, and as an excuse you say, &quot;oh I didn't know&quot;<br />
<br />
-) people don't know how the tool works and assume &quot;this new weird button&quot; is only for people with the profession of enchanting, so they keep hitting greed, like they are used to, and therefore get the item but not disenchanted<br />

shit I missed that part... well, since they nerfed frozen core its still not going to be viable to frost raid, so why the change to deep freeze then? they get a semi nice fix to frost raiding with the frozen core buff, then break it, and give deep freeze a raiding aspect at the same time? that just doesnt make any sense whatsoever...<br />

Enchanting IS a gathering profession whether you like it or not, just like tailoring is even though everyone gets cloth. Just because DE isn't a separate prof doesn't make that aspect of it any less important to keeping enchanting viable. Also, do you not remember the huge fuss caused by JCers when it came out that uncut gems could be bought for emblems/honor? That's right, they were PISSED. And I'm still not seeing my arctic fur, ebonweave, and frost lotus available for anything other than cold, hard cash.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Also, comparing free enchanting mats for all to free gems for all isn't the same - the presence of gems for emblems/honor doesn't detract from the JCers ability to acquire gems themselves.

<br />
Why is that? Because you tend to need SO MANY mats it's annoying as hell for an enchanter to lug that shit along with them, and they can't pre-make it without buying pathetically overpriced scrolls.<br />
<br />
So what do intelligent enchanters do? After grinding to max level, which they generally have to on their own gear because no one pays for low level enchants, they SELL (wat? sell?), YES SELL, their enchanting mats on the AH - to maximize their profits.<br />
<br />
OMG.<br />
<br />
So in other words, you're one of the only people left in the World (of Warcraft) who doesn't get that enchanters work differently than other professions.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that in an instance, you only have a 1 in 5 chance at greens anyway. I've only been in 2 groups where every green went to a DEer - generally people vendor or AH greens. Or hell, collect them and give them to a DEer long after the instance. What you can do in order to make this work in your favor is ask the group, at the beginning ask them if you could have a few greens to 'pay' for your services, and then DE everything else.<br />
<br />
Or you could just be a petulant child who lugs around 2 full bags of mats while every other enchanter in the game laughs their ass off at you. Whatever you like.</div></div><hr />

Maybe on your backwards server it still works like that, but in the developed world, since inscription went live, enchanters have made their money putting scrolls on the AH and people who don't know an enchanter and aren't one themselves have bought them. Yes, scrolls can be expensive, but that's because the glyph market is INCREDIBLY static, and scribes have to make money somehow. Just like enchanters have to make money. &quot;Well you can make money by charging people when you enchant your gear&quot; you say - good in theory, but why the hell should enchanters have to stand around in Dalaran spamming trade chat to make money, when everyone else can just stick their wares on the AH and come back to a tidy profit? Also, it really isn't that easy - there is no set fee for enchanting someone else's gear, so people will either only give you a few gold, or will refuse to pay.<br />
<br />
If enchanting is to remain a viable money maker and not just some niche prof that someone HAS to take for their guild's benefit, then this change as it appears (free mats for all regardless of the presence of an enchanter) cannot go live. Perhaps a better alternative would be to implement a new UI window for enchanting, with set fees for enchants depending on the ilevel or mats required. That way actually obtaining huge amounts of materials wouldn't be such an important part of being and enchanter.</div></div><hr />

The sky is not falling, far from it. In every guild the progresses they make you enchant with the best to be the best. So when you get new gear(which may be every tuesday) you will need to to a jc if the gear had sockets and enchant it.<br />
It is just opening up new doors. Personally if i ever catch a person greeding just to d/e later is no better than the ninja that steals the Phat lewt. The world needs to realize being nice is better than being closed up.<br />
So to all you greedy enchanters i hope you aren't happy that isn't how you are suppose to play and i am happy you are so butthurt if you believe this hurts you.<br />
In the meantime while you cry i will finally be able to get mats for all 3 80 to enchant them five different specs(Rogue, dps druid and healer, tank dk and dps)<br />
And to all those why doesn't herb or ore or skin share? Well why don't you ask if you really need them, i am sure they are willing to share with you.<br />

Second, the profit margin on DEing blue items instead of just vendoring them is rather small, if at all. In our server we (our guild) don't bother with it when running heroics, even if we have a DEr - the vendor value of blues is greater than the cost of a shard.<br />
<br />
Third, if you depend on DEing randomly dropped greens for a living, you're doing it wrong. Se the guides on this very page about how to make a fuckton of enchanting materias with cheap AH materials. I confess I didn't know about that until the day Boub published his guide, and with very little time investment I've made 20k gold in these 4 weeks.

There are multiple issues. From my understanding of the way it's presented in this news post, it's now equal to Greed, rather than below it in priority as was indicated on the US forums. This pretty much screws over anybody who is rolling for off-spec. This becomes far more important if Cross-Realm Raids are ever remotely viable for those who cannot or will not raid amongst those on their own server, so you can't excuse it away with some bullshit &quot;Nobody gives a fuck about heroic gear&quot; tripe.<br />
<br />
Now, the more important issue is that this is because of cross-realm groups, so the ntra-server issues are pretty much moot. You can't trade non-conjured items with those people, so enchanters can't DE items and give them shards/crystals whatever. Understandable that such a change would be implemented, if it weren't forced. However, when combined with the aforementioned if my understanding of the phrasing is indeed correct, there's more people being screwed over. Instead of just rewriting the code on items with trade timers on them to be trade-able just as conjured items are amongst fellow members of your battle-group, and only outside of battlegrounds, they do this.<br />
<br />
I don't sell anything I get as an enchanter. I share amongst my guild and friends outside it. I DE for pugs when I elect to do that. Taking away my say in when my abilities get used is as offensive as being forced to consume feces would be. I don't have a problem with arena, people who stand in fire or other avoidable types of damage, or kill their group members with light bomb or similar mechanics, or people who collect pets or achievement points. Because I'm not forced to do those, I don't, because I don't find them fun.<br />
<br />
As far as &quot;greedy enchanters&quot; and price issues that arise because of them, or people simply purchasing their material and reselling it for a much higher price, it's a non-issue. You can just as easily undercut them. So can anybody else. There is no such thing as a monopoly when all it takes is doing 12k damage to some random mob to create new resources. Or mining a node or two, making some bars, and pounding out a weapon or helm. Or making a few bolts, buying a thread, and crafting a belt.</div></div><hr />

Hello, are you even THINKING? Lets say you are in a dungeon. EVERYONE is rolling on that same thing. You rolled a 35 someone rolled a 99. They get the item, they are going to run out and get it DE'd form themselves so THEY have the mats. <br />
<br />
Now with this in place, AND THE SAME deal. You rolled a 35 he rolled a 99. Oh what's this. GASP He STILL GOT HIS MATS only he didn't need to run to someone else to get it done for him. It doesn't matter if the ****ed thing disenchants or not, the winner of the roll is STILL getting the item, it just saves a step in the breaking down process. Maybe if you weren't being so friggen greedy and lost the attitude you MIGHT have solved that one your self Sherlock. =_=' ::)<br />
<br />
<br />
Except when its a BoP and they have to vendor it instead of creating more enchanting materials.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This doesn't short you any materials.<br />
<br />
That idea only works if everyone passed on greens and blues and let enchanters have everything. They don't.<br />
<br />
Anything you would have won and DE'd for your stock, you'll still win.<br />
<br />
The only difference is the greens/blues that others would have vendored for gold, they're now going to carry out as enchanting materials.<br />
<br />
<br />
See above. Any BoP someone wins that they can't disenchant they will be forced to vendor thereby creating less enchanting materials. With Abyss shatter forcing a person to vendor an epic can remove 10 dust from the market. This builds up with every single person thats not an enchanter.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Enchanting isn't a gathering profession.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just curious where do enchanting materials come from then?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Jewelcrafters create gems, but they're not the only source of it. They need miners to provide ore for it.<br />
<br />
Scribes create inks, but rely on herbalists to provide their mats.<br />
<br />
Alchemists can create potions and gems, but they need herbalists and miners to help them out. <br />
<br />
Leatherworkers need skins to ply their trade. That means they need to have skinning.<br />
<br />
Blacksmiths can make mighty weapons and armor. They need ore from miners to do it.<br />
<br />
Tailors are the only self contained profession like enchanters. They need cloth, however - they don't create cloth. Its equal opportunity access. And they have to compete with anyone who makes bandages. No one says &quot;its cloth, pass to tailors&quot;. Many of their speciality items also create special enchanting dust. Their only access to it is to pay an enchanter, know an enchanter who'll do it for free (this must not exist, because all the enchanters I see are demanding that no one get free mats), or they buy them on the AH. <br />
<br />
Now lets look at enchanters. Like tailors, they require drops from the wild or created items to get their trade materials. Like tailors, no one is automatically going to pass on these items. Unlike every other profession however, they are completely self contained outside of their rods. You can almost level enchanting to maximum without any outside help.<br />
<br />
I think the following solutions would be best:<br />
<br />
1) Make disenchanting a secondary skill. Give enchanters a skill like tailors have to find cloth. Give them more for when they disenchant.<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
2) Since the world of Azeroth is magical in nature, let enchanting mats drop from more places. Like Jcers prospect rare ores to get dusts and shards, let scribes mill rare herbs to find some dust inside. Let skinning magical beasts give some dust also.<br />
<br />
Right now enchanters are the sole source of enchanting reagents and enchants. I don't get how anyone can see that is not fair to the rest of the community. When we combine JC and mining, BS and mining, leatherworking and skinning, alchemy and herbalism, inscription and herbalism then and only then will we all be on the same page.</div></div><hr />

Other classes have abilities that do the same thing, Pally's bubble, Mages Ice block, Hunter's Feign death. There's no way that 1/2 second made rogues OP, you vanish- you proc global CD's (which are a full second)- by the time you can perform another special ability the imunity is gone anyway. <br />
the only reason other classes are chearing about the revert is because those players cant beat rogues, if the rogue class is working properly. Rogues arent OP , they just take more skill to play. Stop bitching about your lack of skill against rogue players, L2 pvp, or transfer to an RP server :P</div></div><hr />

Golden rule and all that, if you fuck over people don't be so hurt when you get fucked over.<br />
<br />
Aren't enchanter getting f*cked over? Enchanters need these mats to LEVEL their own proffesion. My enchanting is at 432 because of the lack of mats i get from just playing around without buying and spending money to get the mats. Yes some people see enchanting as kinda op being the only source of enchants and the enchant reagents but for those who are still leveling this proffesion. Enchanting has always been hard to level up. Now it will be harder as this rolling system will also be implemented on lower levels as well.<br />
So all in all. This will be majorly f*cking over those enchanters who are leveling proffesions and have not done what you have said and have been f*cking their party members over (i do agree with your concept).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Northrend Tailors have a buff which allows them to loot extra cloth from dead bodies, getting cloth is not really an issue.<br />
<br />
Enchanters should get something similar to tailors (or alchemists and their procs) and be able to get extra items when they disenchant things (see the hot fix they've been talking about). DEing something yourself should give more mats then a non enchanter clicking the DE button. It would have to be a low enough chance to not encourage people rolling greed and getting an enchanter to DE it anyway but seeing as we actually had to level our profession to allow us to DE items at higher levels we really should get something out of it.<br />
<br />
I also kinda think that DEing a 245 epic should really give more then a 200 naxx epic. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure exactly what this change will do the value of enchants etc on the AH, the cost of all enchanting mats (except abyss?) will be lower so enchants will cost less, maybe with the lower costs people won't mind giving tips so much now...</div></div><hr />

I always said that is hard enough to get the achivement so we should get the tittle for each BG, Although this only applies to the 3 classic bgs, I'm glad =) ....and maybe somebody else was spamming this too, I can't really say it was my idea, but in the past, is been a QQ for that tittle =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tell you what, to save your bitching I'll roll on the item and vendor it for gold instead.<br />
<br />
And please, stop comparing your profession to gathering professions. No, I don't have to share my herbs, and guess why, because I spent two hours faming on my own for them, without your help, so why would you be entitled to them? On the other hand if I run an instance with you I've earned the greens, blues and purples as much as you have. Those drops belong to everyone, so it fits so should the shards.

Don't tell me to advertise in trade and charge for it, because there is ALWAYS someone else who will do it for free. We wont be able to sell enchants on the AH anymore, because why would people bother when they're already swimming in mats themselves? When this goes live, there will be pretty much no profit to be earned from enchanting, at least for players who don't want to stand around in Dalaran 24 hours a day hoping to get the few people who don't mind paying even when someone else is offering for free.<br />

Fine, I'm cool with that, if you're cool with rolling on the herbs, skins and ores you get WHILST INSIDE THE INSTANCE. What's that? You don't want to do that? How come? Because you spent hours levelling that prof to be able to obtain those mats, and you don't think it's fair to just hand them out to anyone? Hypocrisy isn't attractive.<br />
<br />
And for the record, I've been in a number of PuGs where people have donated their cloth drops to the tailor, and gladly given their greens to the enchanter. Just because you're an asshole doesn't mean the rest of the world is.</div></div><hr />

they cant stun someone who has been active in BG's and arena since season 5 that has atleast full furious, if you dont have the gear, then you dont have the experience and you wouldnt know what to do if you did survive the cheap shot kidney or garrote. Everytime someone complains about dying in a stun (tons of people) all good pvp players hear in there head when they read that is hes terribad at pvp, not that theres an issue with rogues. Rogues are usually 1st chosen targets in arena because they are very squishy, they have just as many weaknesses as strengths. What if you cast a spell and when the cast bar was done nothing happened, or you hit hammer of wrath and nothing happened but the cd was blown, or you pennance and it channels but didnt heal.

This whole enchanting thing is a big joke.<br />
<br />
<br />
As i changed my professions a couple of times, enchanting IS the most expensive prof ive ever seen.<br />
well tailoring or engineering was ok, but enchanting..<br />
<br />
and the ONLY profit you get from this profession next to ring enchants is:<br />
<br />
DISENCHANT and Sell!<br />
and therefor this whole change sucks a lot<br />
<br />
anyone will have materials and no longer sell blues/epics to vendors<br />
prices will go deep down and enchanting not only is about 12-20k gold to level, its also a waste of time<br />
<br />
my jewelcrafting brings me 1000-5000 gold a day, if i do some nice AH job<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
when i changed to enchanting (what was the 5. profession change to 450 in WOTLK), i recognize myself crying about how expensive it was<br />
to skill this (so even after you are DONE with 450 every pattern costs massive amounts of shards. you will need 120-300g per pattern... wtf?) <br />
and recognize saying to a mate, that this whole profession wont make any gold next to selling this mats<br />
<br />
and now?^^</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you've managed to pull of charging people to DE their drops, all the power to you. We never argued that morons don't exist. Maybe you're realising that this change means you can't do that anymore. <br />
<br />
But personally, I'd never pay anyone to DE drops. It's not like I go around demanding gold when someone has to repair/buy reagents before I lay a jeeves/repair bot, or my elixir master charges you extra for you to keep your bonus procs off your own supplied materials. I don't charge leatherworkers to follow me around and skin my corpses while I get me some tasty rhino meat (or leave trash loot on them so they can't skin them). I wonder how many Arctic Fur have proc'd off the bodies we leave behind. <br />
<br />
You would think enchanters would welcome this change because it makes their lives less miserable, having to manually DE loot. <br />
<br />
Also, you'll need to back your theory of reducing the cost of materials with some sort of anecdote or data. <br />
<br />
So now you don't click 4 buttons when I want something DE'd. And the market is ruined- lolwut?<br />
<br />
Go back to selling your 900G Scroll of Enchant Weapon: Berserker and stop crying. <br />
<br />
Perhaps you need to be a little more aggressive in your marketing. Enchanting and JC are the two most sought after profession in the game (yes, I'm guessing here..). <br />
<br />
Q: As a raider, what's your primary goal of playing this game?<br />
A: To get better gear so you can perform better, so you can move onto the next level of content and get more gear.<br />
<br />
Q: What do you do immediately after getting new gear?<br />
A: Enchant and gem the items. (also correct: &quot;Dance.&quot;)<br />
<br />
<br />
I think the real story here is that ENCHANTERS will begin to realise that the real money maker is the ENCHANTER ONLY craftable vellums. Go search for the prices of the most sought after enchants on your realm's AH and get back to me. We'll compare economies.<br />
<br />
<br />
And ask an engineer how s/he feels about all the engineering buffs in the last couple of updates.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Your reasoning is unwelcome here.<br />
<br />
<br />
QFT. So sick of the tug of war that is fixing rogues. <br />
<br />
WE GET IT, ROGUES WERE DESIGNED TO BE GREAT IN A WAY THAT MAKES ROGUES APPEAR EVEN GREATER IN A MECHANIC THAT WASN'T AROUND WHEN ROGUES WERE DESIGNED. (PvP outside of &quot;world pvp&quot;)<br />
<br />
Can't fix this for PvE, it would make rogues too powerful in PvP!<br />
Can't fix this for PvP, it would give rogues an advantage in PvE!<br />
<br />
HOW ABOUT A SEPARATE SET OF MECHANICS FOR ACTUAL PVP/PVE DIFFERENCES!<br />
<br />
I understand &quot;what a nightmare&quot; it could be to &quot;maintain two of every spell&quot; (their cookie-cutter response) - but they could definitely come up with a way that changes spell behavior whether in an instance/the world/arena/battlegrounds. It wouldn't be that hard, you just need to brainstorm and come up iwth the best way to do it. <br />
<br />
Although I'm sure the Blizzard turds feel kind of stupid when they have to pull back things they put into the PTR. With respect to the vanish change, the first thing I thought of was using a well-time vanish to escape some sort of Nova Blast 1-shot-aoe type of damage. But they'd still need to time it correctly, and they're blowing their cooldown instead of just moving over like they &quot;should&quot;. You can probably bet Fel Fire to Frost Wyrms that the change was revoked due to PvP implications outside of having come up with the laziest possible way to 'fix' vanish. (which I'm sure most rogues have given up on)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Make it so vanish does not activate until the server actually receives your command to vanish and replies. That way rogues will get it that its lag causing them to break out of vanish and not some supposed &quot;bug.&quot; Because all it really is is lag, but the client is not actually showing it to make it appear smooth and responsive. It's a common thing done in a lot of multiplayer games.<br />
<br />
Then rogues that experience this &quot;bug&quot; often will realize they have a shitty internet connection.</div></div><hr />

Thought processes within the rogue class? Inconcieveable! No matter what Blizz gives you for talents you're not a ninja, stop pretending to be one.

<br />
yet there is a massive difference between a pro rogue and johhny average rogue, its not like a ret pally where you blow sac if someone is spamming you with CC, freedom for snares, hold the W key and spam your 4 button blindly. Rogues are not a simple class to master, there is a ton of CD management, and you cant just attack blindly, coordination with your mage or lock partner has to occur, damage has to be set up! unlike alot of the big plate melee class's which are quite mindless and skillfree to play. Your poor analysis and anger towards rogues is far off base with reality.</div></div><hr />

And for the record, I've been in a number of PuGs where people have donated their cloth drops to the tailor, and gladly given their greens to the enchanter. Just because you're an asshole doesn't mean the rest of the world is.<br />

For the record, I have a max level enchanter (just recently maxed him out). I DE the items that drop in a group and share the shards and abyss out on a /roll basis because that's fair.

No one said keeping everything they said not disenchanting everything. So people who won the items over you end up with a blue that vendors for 7g or an epic that vendors for 15 and not a shard that sells for 3 times as much. This removes the individual enchanters choice (or possibly the enchanter entirely) from the equation as it will automatically shard it and give it to who ever won the roll denying the enchanter the choice to protect profit. You could say he is being greedy but he is just protecting his markets. If enchanters are forced to DE for you, then I want all ores/herbs/skinning rolled on just as equally. None of this bullshit I leveled my skill to collect these it works both ways.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where did I say that? I only said that if you want free enchanting mats from instances, I want free herbs, ores and skins from instances. Is that really too much to ask?<br />
<br />
What pisses me off is people acting as if enchanters owe you something. If you don't ask at the start of the instance or at the very least after the first boss if anyone can DE and then sort out rules for the shards/crystals, that's your damn problem. As I have stated numerous times in this thread, I always say at the start of a PuG that I can DE, and if it's alright with everyone I would like to keep any shards for buying recipes or crafting high-end enchants. Generally people are happy with that - money isn't hard to come by but on my server at least shards cost upwards of 25g so keeping a good supply can be very costly. If people are not willing to do that, then I ask if they would rather just roll greed and do what they want with it. It's very rare that people will have a hissy fit about not getting mats they deserve once you've made your position clear.<br />
<br />
One final question - do you give strangers free enchants with your mats? Because that is the same principle as this. The argument that people in the PuG put in the same effort you did so should get mats simply does not hold water when you understand that they didn't put in the work to be able to DE loot, just like I didn't put in the work to mine or herb or skin.</div></div><hr />

Inscription is a Gathering proffesion! Without Milling, we wouldnt have inks!<br />
<br />
<br />
While your general argument is not utterly flawed your examples are -&gt; gems can come from several sources - mining/mob-drops/bought from vendors for emblems/honor etc.. so JC is surely not a gathering profession - being able to gain additional gems from prospecting ores is just a bonus - the gathering in this case is done by the mining people.<br />
<br />
Now to inscription. Inks are not created from milling but from &quot;crafting&quot; pigments. So this example is flawed - those before mentioned pigments come from milling true.. and to my knowledge only from milling so that would per se be gathering. However, in order to mill for pigments you will need herbs - which are the true gathered material in this case - done by herbalists. <br />
<br />
So to summarize that - JC's will need miners to get their ores, inscribers will need herbalists to get their herbs. An enchanter doesn't need any other primary profession to &quot;gather&quot; their material.<br />
<br />
You get the point.<br />
<br />
Now to a more personal view of this - Having more than one character (like most of us) I have at least all gathering professions at 450 and most of the crafting professions (that I need) at 400+ so I couldn't care less which profession is better or worse off. But I do agree that I don't really like the trend that an enchanter is obligated to disenchant for his dungeon group.. I mean.. wtf is that shit with the recent changes people are rolling greed either way ask if there's an enchanter in the group (when the run is already over) then I say &quot;sure&quot; and he's trading me due to the 2 hour time window and asks me to disenchant those items - not for the group though just for his personal use oO wtf.. and now I am the greedy one because I roll greed myself to disenchant those items? (or vendor them if I think that gives more profit...)</div></div><hr />

General<br />
[list] Knockbacks no longer dismount players. If on a flying mount, you will be knocked back a short distance before being able to resume flying. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What exactly is the complaint about having the dismount with the knockback?<br />
<br />
I don't like being polymorphed or hexed off of my mount. Can we also stop those from dismounting players while we are at it?<br />
<br />
The knockback isn't just used to knock people out of the air. When being pursued by someone on a mount (flying or not), it helps to be able to dismount them with it while putting them in combat so it takes abit for them to get mounted again. This allows me to get range so I have time to heal, mount, or cast from range. <br />
<br />
Without the dismount, they are right back on top of me immediately. <br />
<br />
Now, that being said . . . I do knock people out of the air all of time. I get in knockback wars with druids, mages, and other shamans. I even dropped herbalism to take up engineering to tinker my cloak with a parachute. It's fun, it's entertaining, BUT it only works against stupid players, or maybe a few good players who make a stupid mistake. <br />
<br />
Half of the classes can counter it anyway. 2 different bubbles, slowfall, iceblock, blink, pounce, charge/intercept, safefall, levitate, parachute, feline grace, instant cast flight form, summoning circle etc.<br />
<br />
So, with all of that, what is the complaint with the dismount? You can't go afk while in the air in plain sight of a class with a knockback? OH NO, QQ more!<br />
<br />
Also, remember that the person casting the knockback falls too. I happen to have a parachute (which stops me from getting a normal enchant) because I put in the time to level engineering.<br />
<br />
<br />
I very rarely kill a decent player with my knockback. I sometimes can kill crappy players with it. No class is completely screwed by having the dismount on the knockbacks. What is the real complaint?</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
I guess I was just dreaming when I saw those things in WoW.<br />
<br />
What about the classes who don't have the ability to &quot;easily&quot; kill people in &quot;2-3 flybys&quot;? Isn't unfair to them in the exact opposite way? Only mages and priests have the &quot;easy&quot; way to kill people afk in midair.<br />
<br />
They could make a change to where the 10% durability doesn't apply if the kill will give another player an HK.<br />
<br />
They could do so much more to prevent the dura loss other then stopping the dismount. <br />
<br />
It's not a spell that's solely used to dismount players in the air (imo, don't go afk in the air), it's a legitimate part of a very useful spell. <br />

You can't sheep a flying player. You also missed Warriors Warlocks Shamans and Death Knights. Is it fair that those 4 classes just have to deal with an die, having no recourse to fight back and having no chance to survive. Thats what happens with those classes, someone knock you off and you just have to sit the and die no choice involved. Don't even say warlock teleport. That means they were prepared for the fight and its complete different case. Warrior charge/intercept is hardly reliable. Hell even rogues can die if its high enough and a druid in combat will have the same issue. That leaves only mages priests paladins and hunters (lol) that can prevent it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My comparison to sheep was in reference to any mount on the ground. Like I said, the knockback isn't just a midair knockback/dismount. It IS used on the ground to dismount people for both offensive and defensive reasons.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't even say warlock teleport.<br />
<br />
Demonic Circle: Teleport (0.5 second cast) - All you can present an argument for is if the knockback happens high enough in the air to kill them AND the person doing the knockback will also die (unless they're a mage). <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You also missed Warriors<br />
<br />
Charge, Intercept - All you can present an argument for is if the knockback happens high enough in the air to kill them AND the person doing the knockback will also die (unless they're a mage). <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hell even rogues can die if its high enough<br />
<br />
Shadowstep, Killing Spree, Safefall - All you can present an argument for is if the knockback happens high enough in the air to kill them AND the person doing the knockback will also die (unless they're a mage). <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Shamans and Death Knights.<br />
<br />
2 classes that have no defense to the knockback/dismount. And it only matters if they are high enough off of the ground to die AND the person doing the knockback will also die (unless they're a mage). And even then, they have to be afk or not mpaying attention, or make a stupid mistake.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Is it fair that those 4 classes just have to deal with an die, having no recourse to fight back and having no chance to survive. Thats what happens with those classes, someone knock you off and you just have to sit the and die no choice involved.<br />
<br />
All you can present an argument for is if the knockback happens high enough in the air to kill them AND the person doing the knockback will also die (unless they're a mage). And it's only 4 in this instance because you are specifically referring to 1 scenario that this knockback is used for. AFK dismounting where 2 of the 3 classes that can do it, will die also.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That means they were prepared for the fight and its complete different case. <br />
<br />
Can you at least try to understand that this IS used for things other than dismounting people in midair? All you can present an argument for is if the knockback happens high enough in the air to kill them AND the person doing the knockback will also die (unless they're a mage).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That leaves only mages priests paladins and hunters (lol) that can prevent it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Again, can you at least try to understand that this is used for things other than dismounting people in midair? All you can present an argument for is if the knockback happens high enough in the air to kill them AND the person doing the knockback will also die (unless they're a mage). <br />
<br />
AGAIN, AGAIN, AGAIN . . . the knockbacks are used in more than instance. Including fighting any class ON THE GROUND. <br />
<br />
I know some of the skills/spells/talents I mentioned won't help if your way up in the air, BUT as you stated SHAMANS and DRUIDS can't stop from falling either and would die in the fall along with the person they dismounted. So only MAGES can reliably dismount people in midair and survive.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, we're taking away the dismount because 1 class in the game can safely and reliably dismount and kill 2 other classes in the game.<br />
<br />
And remember kids . . . we don't stick tweezers in the electrical outlet (don't attack a class with knockback if they are waiting on you on top of a tower). BE SMARTER, BE BETTER, DON'T TAKE THIS AWAY BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE QQ ABOUT BEING DUMB AGAINST KNOCKBACKS.<br />
<br />
Taking away the dismount in all situations is not the right response to people crying about dying once or twice a week to a lucky hit while they were afk over wintergrasp fortress while it is owned by the opposing faction. Work around the durability loss if that's the problem, but don't take away the dismount.</div></div><hr />

You can't Polymorph someone off a flying mount. I've tried it. Players on a flying mount, I believe, are 'immune'. As a mage it's my dream to drop down above someone on a flying mount, POM Polymorph them and then slowfall myself to safety. Alas, my dream, like yours, is not possible.</div></div><hr />

And the issue was knocking people off midair and causing them to die without recourse. As I pointed out Paladins mages and priests can reliably survive a fall at any height. Druids if are high enough to kill someone are high enough to break combat and flight form. So I will concede the point on druids. So mages and druids could reliably kill Dks Warriors (you can't count on being able to charge something) Warlocks (You can't count on demonic circle), Rogues (You can't count on safefall at those heights) and Shamans.</div></div><hr />

Why can't anyone see that the dismount IS ALSO USED ON THE GROUND? Do you not understand this?<br />
<br />
As far as the dying from the fall . . . get over it. You die all of the time, why are you crying so much about it this time?<br />
<br />
If it is the durability damage, change that instead. If someone is dismounted by a knockback and will die from fall damage, take away the 10% dura loss. Simple fix without taking away part of the fun in the spells.<br />
<br />
If you take away the dismount from Thunderstorm, Typhoon, and Blast Wave then go ahead and take away the dismount from Polymorph and Hex. They are all used to dismount people while on the ground.</div></div><hr />
