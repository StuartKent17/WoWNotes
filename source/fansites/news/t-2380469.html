Venturebeat (www.venturebeat.com) sat down for an interview (https://venturebeat.com/2018/02/25/blizzard-chief-mike-morhaime-foresees-a-long-road-ahead-for-esports/) with Mike Morhaime and Kim Phan to discuss the Overwatch League and esports!<br />

<br />
Engagement levels between esports and traditional sports is not that different. In some cases esports is higher.<br />
This is just the beginning. More interest is coming now from traditional players, sponsors and broadcast companies.<br />
Sponsors from traditional sports are starting to look into esports now.<br />
There is a lot of room for growth. Media companies are trying to devote a part of their business to this segment.<br />
Each game title will have its own trends just like different sports do.<br />
The dynamics are changing. Cable subscription dollars have no benefit to esports.<br />
Unlike sports, where you watch esports is the same place where you play the game and will likely help its engagement grow faster.<br />
Blizzard is listening to feedback and trying to come up with ways to make Overwatch easier to understand to viewers.<br />
Blizzard tries to implement things in spectating that adhere to both a non-player and a fan.<br />
It is up to each individual fan whether the game or the players in the league are the most interesting part of watching.<br />
Getting a strong stable of team owners who were invested in the league was important to initial success.<br />
The development team is also very important and making sure the same strategy isn't used over and over.<br />
The idea of City-based teams was taken from traditional sports and helps with sponsorship.<br />
