quite the opposite. they represent the best trait of intelligent organisms: need for progress through conflict. they are definately on a much higher intellectual level than modern phds in marxism 'war crime, how to prevent wurrs'</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kargath, Grommash, Durotan(not iron horde), Kilrogg, Blackhand, Gul'dan(shadow council), Ner'zhul(shadow council)<br />
Maraad can't know that Durotan will join the MU horde, and I don't think Gul'dan and Ner'zhul will be skipped just because they aren't iron horde when they are still enemies.<br />
<br />
So 4 iron horde warlords, but only 3 have been shown.<br />

What does Kilrogg even do in WoD? I haven't heard much about him since the expansion announcement.<br />

Well, he lives in tanaan so he will probably not appear before the tanaan patch.</div></div><hr />

I don't get it either, but well. It is being made to get to know the Warlords we WILL face. I don't think accuracy or Lore was any kind of thing their Focus was on. It's just promotional stuff.</div></div><hr />

Nearly half an hour later and still no page. I know Blizzard doesn't do a very good job where the website is concerned - it's pretty much always on the backburner. But now they can't be bothered to care about being on time, either, with webpage-related promos for their upcoming expansion? ٩◔̯◔۶</div></div><hr />

A lot of people in WoW... especially the orcs, have mommy/daddy issues. Is that just an easy storytelling arc that they are borrowing from? Or are they really trying to setup the bonds of family and that war (therefore, a World of Warcraft) is heavily influenced by this? Do we ever see someone grow up in a nice, normal family, and because a major lore character in WoW?</div></div><hr />

Well, if you count all the people that never have any family mentioned, there are plenty.</div></div><hr />

Who doesn't have family that's a major lore character? I didn't know who Killrog's father was before, but as soon as they tell his story, daddy issues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Khadgar, Lothar, Tyrande, Malfurion, Lor'themar, the non-Moira Bronzebeards, etc. Plenty of characters never have any parents mentioned, and I think it's safe to assume they grew up with a normal life. <br />
<br />
The problem is that if a character does have family mentioned, chances are they are going to have some conflict with them otherwise there wouldn't be much purpose in them having named parents in the first place.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hardwing</div><div class="date">2014-09-19, 08:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I imagine Kilrogg's father saw in his vision something like that his clan was in great danger and that he wouldn't be able to lead it to victory. Seeing his son kill him he came to understand, or rather believe, because it is what the video is about, that his son could and so he waited for this day to come. In the end he seemed proud that the day had finally come. <br />
<br />
As for daddy issues, I see great love/respect between these two. Had Grom been son to this chieftain, he most likely would have killed him years ago, but Kilorgg served him respectfully despite his doubts. That there is always something dramatic when parents are involved in such videos is probably because &quot;father/son, mother/daughter make a happy hunting trip and nothing happens&quot; would be a bit boring.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem is that if a character does have family mentioned, chances are they are going to have some conflict with them otherwise there wouldn't be much purpose in them having named parents in the first place.<br />
<br />
I need to broaden it a little, that it is distinctly family issues, not just mom and dad. You make an excellent point, if there is no interesting conflict, then the family member wouldn't exist. But look at Malfurion, battle with his brother. For that matter, Sylvanas, and her sisters/brother. I get that family conflict makes an interesting story, there are ties there that you can't just walk away from, so you have to put up with stuff, but it is overused, and too much of a crutch. Of the four Warlord stories so far, three were about family. With Kilrog, they could have done anything. His vision didn't show death, so he knew he could conquer and no worry. Or show an impossible death, that he would never think could come to be (ala MacBeth). There was potential for something great. But instead it was &quot;my daddy is holding me back, I need to prove myself by killing him.&quot; I don't know, I'm just looking for more plot ideas than someone saving/killing/getting upset about their parent/sibling/child dying/going mad.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps that is the twist they're building up to: That isn't the real Maraad. <br />
Someone in disguise maybe?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard's cinematics take a lot bloody longer than this to crank out. <br />
<br />
If you want an actual comparison, compare it to cutscenes like Arthas vs Illidan in Warcraft 3. Then gauge the difference.</div></div><hr />

A son sees a vision of an empowered clan, he kills his father to take control. It is just about the most basic story in any tribal setting. They wrote that in like 10 min if that. This didn't even need a video and was rather pointless I feel. They start it off like they were going to show this Orc to have some deep spiritual beliefs. Instead it is just a chieftain ritual and never mentions any kind of faith other than I had vision. This one was the most 101 story telling every and never deserved a short. But he is a Warlord and they obviously got to him and went fuck it use the most basic tribal story.</div></div><hr />

Gul'dan isn't part of the Iron Horde and Ner'zhul isn't part of it for very long. This is focusing on the main antagonists for that faction.</div></div><hr />

Maraad just said the vision of his death, they just showed to us how he will end up dying, he is not painting pictures to Varian.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's why we see Kilrogg here killed by Horde/Alliance. <br />
<br />
Grom's mate was killed by Ogres but in MU she had already had Garrosh. (Like 95% sure on that one.)<br />
<br />
So in short Voice doesn't match picture that's the issue, not like Maraad getting revamped AU memories from any Bronze Dragons or anything....</div></div><hr />

It was wrong, and it's still wrong on the OP @ Blizzard's site :) The link in the post have just a single word 'killrogg' and it should be ending with the 'killrogg-deadeye'<br />

quite the opposite. they represent the best trait of intelligent organisms: need for progress through conflict. they are definately on a much higher intellectual level than modern phds in marxism 'war crime, how to prevent wurrs'<br />

Yes it doesn't work, because it's the link from the original post that was posted on the site. I wanted to show you, that it is still incorrect :)<br />
<br />
The working one is ending with 'kilrogg-deadeye' and the wrong one with just 'kilrogg'.<br />
<br />
Go there and see. It's still invalid: http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/blog/15975234/lords-of-war-part-four-kilrogg-19-09-2014</div></div><hr />
