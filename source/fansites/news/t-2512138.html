How is it not? It's a new official video from Blizzard, that is still unique despite being a collection of previously released cinematics.<br />

Regardless, does it even have to be news? If we are to nitpick at non-news posts on the main page, I'd say there are far worse stuff than this, but you do you. Nitpick on!</div></div><hr />

So why cut something that is great like the Cinematic? Better not making „15 Year old Patch WoW“ and putting the money and time into BfA. Would be way better.</div></div><hr />

The people making these cinematics are in house most likely and getting the same paycheck regardless of what they are working on, so doubt &quot;money was poured&quot; into anything more than it already was. Attacking people just makes you look more wrong to the rest of us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly. This was put together by regular staff at blizz that handles this kind of stuff. It wasn't some special project, and likely took that employee an afternoon to finish. It's also laughable the notion that what someone perceives to be &quot;BFA's problems&quot; could be solved by just diverting money. Things don't quite work that way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean... you're comparing apples to oranges. The CGI effort that goes into these cinematic isn't cheap and takes quite some time to do. I wish they had done some more of these back in WOTLK, could you image some more cinematics like the lich king opening one where he summons Sindragosa from the ice and rallies the undead?</div></div><hr />

It would be incredibly expensive to scale the small team at Blizzard to one that could get a movie out in a reasonable time frame. They probably took as long to make ten minutes as it did ILM to do ALL of the Warcraft movie. The Blizzard cinematic team is very, very good, and they have knocked it out of the park for years now, but they simply don't have the resources or budget to scale to feature length stuff - and it would take them years.</div></div><hr />

Truely a disgusting piece of shit expansion.<br />

I almost feel sorry for people like you who are so obsessively attached to one side of a fictional storyline in a 15 year old video game. Almost, and then I see garbage posts like this where you spit out your vitriolic opinion about someone else's story as if you could've done any better, all in the aid of attempting to soothe your own fragile ego or a desperate wail for attention. Arthas, Uther, Varian, Anduin, Jaina, Bolvar - all of these characters and more have had their stories told in this expansion or recently, and you're here saying its a &quot;truely [sic] disgusting piece of shit expansion&quot; because you didn't get exactly, specifically, what you alone wanted. Petulant child.</div></div><hr />

The price on them would rise if not double per new fully cgi desgined character, that's why you see the same people on these over and over. <br />
<br />
But, this demonstrates they could take 3-4 years and release a full featured movie with this quality and earn millions.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khaza-R</div><div class="date">2019-10-01, 12:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It honestly blows my mind they spent what couldn’t be less than $40,000 each for these cinematics to be made (yearly salary of all involved ‘/. Time lapse from beginning to release) and they hyper focused them on a single character, in an expansion that revolves around so many important characters in the story. <br />
<br />
We could have had a glorious cinematic render of every horde leader deliberating (it’d be the first goblin on a cgi cinematic) or all of the alliance leaders (first gnome as well) or cgi versions of the new allied races, or a city we’ve never seen in glorious high-def big budget (Teldrassil would have been incredible seeing in cgi).<br />
<br />
I can’t believe they chose to do it this way.<br />
<br />
Yeah that's not really how it works. Once they make the assets it becomes a lot less work-intensive for them to re-use them. That's why you see all the main characters repeated. <br />
<br />
Its also no coincidence that every Forsaken model you see from the archers on the ramparts, to the assassins in Outland, to bannerbae are all females with a similar model.</div></div><hr />

If so who will be in them? :D<br />
<br />
Well, Illidan was in all of Legion's cinematics, so probably Arthas!?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hope next expansion is about Alliance characters doing pure evil shit (a la Garrithos, that Anduin &quot;forgot&quot; to mention).</div></div><hr />

Boo Hoo. Cry more. This constant whining, trying to pick apart Blizzards story. What have you accomplished? Nothing.</div></div><hr />
