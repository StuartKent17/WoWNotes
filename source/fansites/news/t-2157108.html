Patch 7.1.5 Hotfixes - January 23<br />

[All class changes below will take effect with weekly realm restarts in each region.]<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/270-Druid) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/druid) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#s) / Artifact Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/artifact-calculator#tAAAAAAAA) / PvP Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/pvp-talent-calculator#s))<br />
<br />
Feral<br />
<br />
Increased the damage of most Feral spells and abilities by 8% (Ashamane's Frenzy, Brutal Slash, Ferocious Bite, Maim, Moonfire, Rake, Shred, Swipe, Thrash, Rip).<br />
<br />
Developers’ Notes: Feral's playstyle feels good, but isn't putting up the numbers that it should be, so we're giving them an across-the-board damage buff.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/271-Hunter) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/hunter) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#M) / Artifact Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/artifact-calculator#NAAAAAAAA) / PvP Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/pvp-talent-calculator#M))<br />
<br />
Combat Experience (Pet Passive) now increases the damage of primary pets by 60% (was 50%).<br />
<br />
Developers’ Notes: This is primarily a damage buff to Beast Mastery, but will have a tiny benefit to Survival and occasionally Marksmanship as well.<br />
<br />
Marksmanship<br />
<br />
Arcane Shot (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/185358) now generates 8 Focus (was 5).<br />
Multi-Shot (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/2643) now generates 3 Focus per target hit (was 2).<br />
Sidewinders (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/214579) damage increased by 33%.<br />
<br />
Developers’ Notes: Marksmanship has given a lot of feedback that the rotation often winds up casting too many consecutive Focus generators. We are making two changes: first, helping avoid that problem by increasing the Focus generation of Arcane Shot and Multi-Shot. Second, making it more attractive to use Sidewinders in more situations, for players who prefer the pacing of the rotation with that talent.<br />
<br />

<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/272-Mage) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/mage) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#g) / Artifact Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/artifact-calculator#hAAAAAAAAA) / PvP Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/pvp-talent-calculator#g))<br />
<br />
Arcane<br />
<br />
Increased the damage of most Arcane spells and abilities by 8% (Arcane Barrage, Arcane Blast, Arcane Explosion, Arcane Missiles, Arcane Orb, Nether Tempest, Supernova).<br />
Overpowered (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/155147) now increases the damage and mana cost bonuses of Arcane Power to 60% (was 70%).<br />
Amplification now increases Arcane Missiles damage by 12% (was 15%).<br />
<br />
Developers’ Notes: Arcane has been doing well in Patch 7.1.5, but its numbers are lacking a bit. We're giving them an across-the-board damage buff, but tempering that with small reductions to a couple of new talents that are proving to be too strong.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fire<br />
<br />
Increased the damage of most Fire spells and abilities by 3% (Blast Wave, Cinderstorm, Dragon's Breath, Fire Blast, Fireball, Flame Patch, Flamestrike, Living Bomb, Meteor, Phoenix Flames, Pyroblast, Scorch).<br />
Pyroblast (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/11366) mana cost reduced by 20%.<br />
Flamestrike (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/2120) mana cost reduced by 17%.<br />
<br />
Developers’ Notes: Under certain circumstances, it was possible for Fire to run out of mana. It's only intended that mana is a constraint on Fire's utility, not its damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Frost<br />
<br />
Increased the damage of most Frost spells and abilities by 4% (Ebonbolt, Blizzard, Cone of Cold, Flurry, Frost Bomb, Frostbolt, Frozen Orb, Ice Lance, Ice Nova, Waterbolt, Ray of Frost, Water Jet).<br />
Comet Storm (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/153595) damage increased by 30%.<br />
Flurry (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/16282) now fires its missiles faster.<br />
<br />
Developers’ Notes: Comet Storm is failing to live up to expectations, so we're buffing its damage. The Flurry change will help Flurry feel more responsive, while simultaneously solving a potential issue where Winter's Chill could apply to two Ice Lances (instead of just one, as intended) at extremely high Haste levels.<br />

<br />
Brewmaster<br />
<br />
Keg Smash (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/121253) damage increased by 10%, and it no longer deals reduced damage to 6+ targets.<br />
Breath of Fire (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/115181) damage increased 11%.<br />
<br />
Developers’ Notes: Brewmasters could use a bit of help on damage, especially in AoE.<br />
<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/273-Paladin) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/paladin) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#I) / Artifact Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/artifact-calculator#JAAAAAAAA) / PvP Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/pvp-talent-calculator#I))<br />
<br />
Retribution (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/183435)<br />
<br />
Crusade (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/224668) now increases damage and Haste by 3% per stack (was 3.5%).<br />
Blade of Justice (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/184575) damage increased by 20%, unchanged in PvP.<br />
<br />
Developers’ Notes: Retribution's total damage is looking quite strong in 7.1.5, which is fine on its own. However, how that damage is delivered matters quite a bit as well. We've been seeing more and more than Paladins find that the optimal way to maximize their performance is to focus everything they can on boosting their damage during Crusade. This creates a number of problems, including: Crusade feels mandatory, your damage feels very unrewarding outside of Crusade, trinkets and artifact traits are viewed as either amazing or terrible based on whether they synergize with Crusade, and others.<br />
As such, we're going to tone down Crusade, and compensate with a buff to Blade of Justice. For those that had maximized Crusade to an extreme degree, this may result in a small overall nerf – this is intended. This change also helps prevent Divine Hammer from being too dominant in single-target situations.<br />

<br />
Destruction<br />
<br />
Chaos Bolt (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/215279) damage increased by 9%.<br />
Rain of Fire (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/5740) damage increased by 30%.<br />
Cataclysm (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/152108) damage increased by 29%.<br />
<br />
Developers’ Notes: Destruction's damage isn't as high as it should be. In particular, some of its spells that should feel the most rewarding aren't hitting hard enough, especially in AoE situations. We're buffing the damage of those spells. <br />

Upcoming Class Tuning Changes - 1/24/17<br />
Updated the original post with a couple of additions/revisions:<br />
<br />
<br />
Arcane Mage: Damage increase on most spells went from 5% to 8% Fire Mage: Damage of most spells increased by 3% Frost Mage: Comet Storm damage increase went from 24% to 30%, and damage of most spells increased by 4%<br />
<br />
<br />
Convergence of Fate Changes<br />
Here's the changes we're looking to make for Convergence of Fate's interaction with some of the throughput cooldowns it affects. These numbers are compared to the trinket's current performance on live, and are not additive with each other.<br />
<br />
Frost Death Knight<br />
<br />
with Empower Rune Weapon: +10% proc rate with Hungering Rune Weapon: -23% proc rate<br />
<br />
Unholy Death Knight<br />
<br />
with Summon Gargoyle: +68% proc rate with Dark Arbiter: no change<br />
<br />
Feral Druid<br />
<br />
with Berserk: no change with Incarnation: -45%<br />
<br />
Note: Incarnation was not properly working with Convergence, which has now been fixed. The number given here is relative to Convergence's proc rate with Berserk.<br />
<br />
Windwalker Monk<br />
<br />
with Storm, Earth, and Fire: -62% proc rate with Serenity: -75% proc rate<br />
<br />
Retribution Paladin<br />
<br />
with Avenging Wrath: +250% proc rate with Crusade: +25% proc rate<br />
<br />
Note: This change should bring Convergence back to roughly its original effectiveness for Ret Paladins who are not using Crusade.<br />
Additionally, on the topic of tank trinkets, we'll be increasing Animated Exoskeleton's maximum shield amount by 33%. We're continuing to investigate tank trinkets, but that change will make it in for this week's hotfix.<br />
<br />
<br />
Upcoming Trinket Changes<br />
In general, we’ve found that our tuning on trinkets which relied on a direct damage or healing effect (as opposed to their raw stats) have come up a bit short this expansion. To help address that, we’re making the following changes:<br />
<br />
<br />
Claw of the Crystalline Scorpid (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140790-claw-of-the-crystalline-scorpid): Damage increased by 30%.<br />
Arcanogolem Digit (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140794-arcanogolem-digit): Damage increased by 30%.<br />
Entwined Elemental Foci (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140796-entwined-elemental-foci): The amount of Critical Strike, Mastery, and Haste granted by this item’s proc has been increased by 5%.<br />
Might of Krosus (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140799-might-of-krosus): Base damage reduced by 25%, but is now always a critical strike.<br />
<br />
The tooltip for Might of Krosus will display the amount of damage that will result from the critical hit, not the base damage.<br />
Also fixed a bug where the cooldown was incorrectly being reduced if Might of Krosus damaged at least 3 targets.<br />
<br />
Draught of Souls (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140808-draught-of-souls): The Use effect of this trinket now respects the global cooldown.<br />
<br />
The damage of this trinket is now reduced by 30% for Unholy Death Knights (was reduced by 40%).<br />
Designer Notes: Since Draught of Souls deals Shadow Damage, it’s increased by Unholy’s Mastery, which means we needed to reduce its base damage to keep its overall value similar to other classes. It’s currently a little too low, however, so we’re increasing the damage it deals for Unholy.<br />
<br />
Icon of Rot (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140798-icon-of-rot): Damage increased by 40%.<br />
Pharamere's Forbidden Grimoire (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140800-pharameres-forbidden-grimoire): Damage increased by 85%.<br />
Fury of the Burning Sky (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140801-fury-of-the-burning-sky): Damage increased by 40%.<br />
Star Gate (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140804-star-gate): Damage increased by 30%.<br />
Aluriel's Mirror (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140795-aluriels-mirror): Healing-over-time amount increased by 140%. Detonation effect reduced by 35%.<br />
<br />
Designer Notes: Aluriel’s Mirror’s detonation effect is strong when it activates, but hard to rely on. We’re increasing the heal-over-time effect significantly to improve the up-front value of this trinket, and reducing the detonation effect slightly to compensate.<br />
<br />
Perfectly Preserved Cake (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140793-perfectly-preserved-cake): Absorb amount increased by 140%.<br />
Etraeus' Celestial Map (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140803-etraeus-celestial-map): The amount of Critical Strike, Mastery, and Haste granted by this item’s proc has been increased by 5%.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for Convergence of Fates (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140806-convergence-of-fates), we’re spending a little extra time to make sure our changes here are as comprehensive as possible, so we don’t have final numbers yet. However, we can share our overall plan for the changes we intend to make. We intend to reduce its base effectiveness (before talents) for Windwalkers, and increase its base effectiveness for Retribution Paladins and Frost and Unholy Death Knights. Separately, we plan to adjust its effectiveness individually for the following talents:<br />
<br />
Serenity (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/152173) (Windwalker)<br />
Crusade (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/224668) (Retribution Paladin)<br />
Incarnation (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/102543-incarnation-king-of-the-jungle) (Feral Druid)<br />
Hungering Rune Weapon (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/207127) (Frost Death Knight)<br />
Dark Arbiter (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/207349) (Unholy Death Knight)<br />
<br />
<br />
We’re planning to make these changes with the next weekly restarts, alongside the release of Mythic Nighthold. Overall, this should make the trinkets in Nighthold more competitive with other trinkets available elsewhere in the expansion.<br />
<br />
Does this mean that the CoF changes will be there as well with the reset this week, since you said you wanted a little extra time to ensure they were as comprehensible as possible?<br />
Yes. The exact numbers haven't been completely finalized yet, but the plan is to have that finished in time for weekly resets.<br />
<br />
We'll look into Draught and its effect for Warriors a bit more. Worth noting that the change to have it on the GCD does mean the trinket will be a bit weaker after these hotfixes for most classes (Unholy DK being the exception, due to the damage increase).<br />
<br />
Regarding the Unholy damage reduction for Draught, again, that's only there to counteract the fact that Unholy's Mastery increases Draught's damage. Either way, its damage is going up by ~17% with this hotfix, which is pretty substantial.<br />
<br />
We'll also take another look at Nightblooming Frond.<br />
<br />
How about tank trinkets ? they are completely underwhelming, my 885 mythic + trinkets have higher absorbs and stam ......<br />
Tank trinkets are on our to-do list, but not for this round of trinket tuning. We agree that they need some help.<br />

Patch 7.2 - Class Feedback<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/272-Mage) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/mage) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#g) / Artifact Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/artifact-calculator#hAAAAAAAAA) / PvP Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/pvp-talent-calculator#g))<br />
Patch 7.2 Artifact Traits<br />
Tuning on the datamined 7.2 traits is very preliminary and/or nonexistent at the moment. I don't doubt there is a point at which additional duration on Combustion could add the correct amount of DPS for an artifact trait, even if that turns out to be a higher amount than 1s due to Combustion being less bursty than it was in 7.1.<br />
<br />
Phoenix's Warmth (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/238091-phoenixs-warmth?artifactRank=1)--we are considering changing the mechanic on this and similar artifact traits to something other than &quot;nearest allies&quot;, so it doesn't feel like it's inducing some complicated positioning puzzle in raids that are trying to optimize DPS. That said, it will still likely feel random to an extent (in fact, it may well be &quot;four random nearby allies&quot;). (Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20752552912?page=1#2))<br />

Patch 7.2 - Crusade<br />
We are definitely keenly aware that people feel better when we fix a problem by buffing something, rather than fixing it by nerfing something. If you look across classes and talent rows in 7.1.5, you'll see the great majority of balance issues were addressed by buffing underperforming talents. There are a few factors that go into this decision though, and it generally has to be handled on a case-by-case basis.<br />
<br />
One issue when balancing a lopsided talent row is whether we want the overall power of the spec to go slightly up or slightly down in the process. In the case of Retribution during our tuning adjustments for the opening of Nighthold, we intended to slightly nerf the topend performance of the spec (essentially, the performance of players stacking trinkets/relics/legendaries that all build around Crusade). I know there's no easy way to deliver that message, but hopefully it's at least worth clarifying that it's not some accident of how we chose to balance the L100 row. Players say &quot;why couldn't we buff Divine Purpose instead of nerfing Crusade&quot;, for the very understandable reason that the former wouldn't have resulted in a slight DPS nerf. But we were conscious of the slight DPS nerf when we decided to do it this way.<br />
<br />
Another factor is that there are sometimes limits on how powerful we want an individual talent to be, regardless of balance within the row. Divine Purpose and Crusade are both very strong talents, that have a significant impact on the rotation and playstyle of the spec (and as mentioned, on gear/talent/relic/etc. decisions), even at their current strength. Balancing Retribution L100 at an even higher point would start causing more issues--Divine Purpose would allow strings of multiple free finishers very often, Crusade would continue to represent a majority of the spec's damage within a cooldown, and Holy Wrath would have to get even more bursty to try to compete with the other two. Sometimes we have to be careful about addressing all balance problems by buffing two talents up to match the highest one, because it can lead to a lot of power creep on the importance of a single talent to an entire DPS rotation.

Loaded Dice (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/238139-loaded-dice?artifactRank=1) - New Outlaw Gold Trait Feedback<br />
It should be a DPS gain even for players who are optimizing well, because you will lose fewer Combo Points to rerolling Roll the Bones (and thereby gain Run Through damage).<br />
<br />
We will monitor the tuning as always, but it seems likely that a guaranteed triple buff would be a lot stronger than it initially appears. If you know that a particular roll is going to be a triple, then you can make sure to set up a 54 second duration on it. And given the frequency of Adrenaline Rush, that would be a very high uptime on a guaranteed triple buff. True Bearing uptime would go way up due to this, which adds many Adrenaline Rushes to the rotation on average. That positive feedback loop on Outlaw is rather powerful, and we have to watch for it when setting up this trait, but will continue to keep an eye on how it's borne out when testing begins.

Battle.Net Balance<br />
Wasnt the ingame token thing ment to come with 7.1.5? So you could add Battle.Net balance with it instead?<br />
No, that feature is coming at a later time. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/818969889465450496))<br />

Survival as an option? yes because raid teams really want to switch out ranged for even more melee (not hardly any parses as survival in comparison to every other spec)<br />
Mages are at the lower end of the spectrum for a change, they will bounce back don't think they need a huge buff though<br />

Well the fact that mages are getting buffed (see the blue post above), albeit a small buff (see my previous no huge buff required) and will perform better<br />
<br />
Re state of Frost: Frost mage is way better than the numbers on logging sites suggest because a lot of the best mages are playing Fire right now.- Ion from the 7.1 Q&amp;A which still holds relevance, to add to which look at top parsing frost mages and they are doing pretty solid<br />
<br />
I mean look at hunters, they got destroyed with 7.1.5 with MM's rotation being completely changed and blizzard responded with a small numbers buff which made them still lower tier.. balance is ever changing wont be long before mages and hunters &quot;bounce back&quot; and will be a huge DPS source again, all ebs and flows bud</div></div><hr />

Seriously why don't they just remove this shit. It is horrible to see the gigantic back and forth on this thing where one might have to go to great lengths to get it and the next day it's just a shiny weight on your letters. Oh and their balancing is just gloriously fucked up. S Enhancement gets 9 prms on 3 min CD but if Frost DKs have the gull, the fucking nerve to pick a talent they are getting their 6 sec reduced to 4.6 which on a THREEE MINUTE cd is the same as Rets was previously almost with 4.2 on a TWO MINUTE cd, how fucked up is that?<br />
On the mandatory talents, yea they want to and hope to sugarcoat it by repeating &quot;Oh it would be super duper sweet if balance was only buffing inferior things&quot;, get the fuck real that is not happening period. They want to appeal some more to the public but only buff based balance doesn't exist, that would spiral out of control in weeks, so of course the things that 100% of the people pick and just destroy other picks are gonna get hammered. Also just on a personal note if they see this, I hope their balancing team gets shagged by a champion racehorse, I play Frost DK, they just took away a lot of our procs and disguised it as a buff (which to this day they did not even acknowledge in any way or form), but they didn't leave it at that oh no. Now we get out brand new 7.2 artifact trait which is THE FUCKING SAME THEY TOOK AWAY. It's like taking away our toy, kicking us, then throwing the toy down and saying we can ahve it back for some money and then they go ahead and spit in our faces as well.</div></div><hr />

If you knew how the &quot;overall&quot; on warcraftlogs works, you'd see that it's not really a reliable way to see where a class is over the various bosses of the raid, and hence can not be used to judge the state of said class.<br />

I said we're good on 3 bosses, decent on 1, mid to bottom on the rest.. That's pretty much middle of the pack overall. Which is pretty balanced if you look at the big picture.

Deaths effect the statistics from warcraft logs. And did you honestly say that its statistic not real game? The statistics come from us players. Deaths grant the Retribution paladin &quot;Retribution&quot; meaning the 75th percentile may be inflated compared to other classes due to raid member's deaths.</div></div><hr />

They RARELY get &quot;tweaks&quot; when all the other classes are essentially getting overhauled. This time they overpowered everyone else and now it's catchup time for the Mages.<br />
<br />
I did the math and even with the &quot;Talent Nerfs&quot; it turns out they're actually a 3-6% DPS increase (with the 8% buff across the board taken into account). I'm gunna kill it in Nighthold tonight!</div></div><hr />

Crusade's haste buff made Ret fun. The fact that it was also the obvious DPS leader was just icing on the cake. Plus DP is garbage and Holy Wrath is a gimmick trash talent that literally nobody takes. They could have reduced damage output without affecting the fun part, but did they? Nope, too hard to change two numbers instead of just one I guess.<br />
<br />
Honestly, is there anyone who still doesn't realize that it's amateur hour in Blizzard's class design office?</div></div><hr />

Retribution in reality was not the top. The reason why the logs show this is because of the retribution passive. This makes Rets seem stronger than they really are because new content translates to more deaths.</div></div><hr />

Ah, dont worry we can always opt for the super strong talent DP !<br />
I envy those pala devs , if i come to work smashed/stonded i get fired . They get to be &quot;creative&quot; lol . :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
What the devs have said about retribution paladins has brought this misapprehensions about ret into the foglight. We've ALWAYS been a cooldown spec. This began with the massive buff for ret pallys back in TBC with the implentation of Avenging Wrath, Crusader Strike and Hammer of Wrath. <br />
<br />
The reason ret pally's are the top dps in all brackets except 100% percentile is because of our OP passive, Retribution, once Nighthold has been out for a few months (if hypothetically blizz didn't nerf crusade) we wouldn't be top 1 dps. <br />
<br />
Also, why would they buff Blade of Justice instead of Crusader Strike? Black of Justice is our 3rd ability in terms of priority and the 20% damage increase is still a large dps loss with 7.5% loss to Crusade. Why not buff our strength stat weight or buff the damage by all our abilities? I feel this is another situation where blizz nerfs what they THINK is an outlier without actually reaching out to the community. I'd be fine with the crusade nerf if our other abilities were buff by at least 5%. Take notice, I know how we're getting another golden trait in 7.2 that will make our next Blade of Justice after casting Templar's Verdict increased by 60% but this isn't until the next raid tier. Why not rets now instead of at 7.2?<br />
<br />
Finally: Retribution Paladin<br />
with Avenging Wrath: +250% proc rate<br />
with Crusade: +25% proc rate<br />
<br />
T R I G G E R E D <br />
Blizz is trying to make Divine Purpose better than Crusade for convergence? I'd be fine with this if DP proc rate wasn't 20% and based upon mobs struck by abilities.</div></div><hr />

spellblade #6<br />
Tichondrius middle<br />
Augur bit above middle<br />
Krosus close to bottom<br />
Botanis top<br />
Elisande #4<br />
Gul'dan just above middle<br />
<br />
So saying we're good for 3 fights, decent for 1 more and middle to bottom on rest is pretty fucking accurate. And that's at 99th percentile, even worse at lower percentile.<br />
If you're going to look at facts, mayube actually LOOK AT THE FACTS!<br />

<br />
Where is the complaining? I'm simply pointing out the facts. I'm quite happy about our position that's in ~middle if you look over all the bosses.</div></div><hr />
