Upcoming changes to Wintergrasp on Test Realms<br />
In the next PTR build we will be implementing several changes to how the Wintergrasp queue and group formations will work.<br />
<br />
While in the queue for Wintergrasp, you will have an icon on your mini map that will allow you to leave the queue. This will function much like the current battleground queue button that is present on the mini map.<br />
Players that queue for the Wintergrasp battle and are selected to join will be placed into raid groups upon entering the zone. These raid groups will function similarly to the battleground raid groups with a few exceptions. Players can leave it at any time, the leader can issue invites, etc. The only restriction is that if a player leaves Wintergrasp while the battle is active, they will be removed from the raid (to make room for the player that will take their place).<br />
If the battle is not active this does not happen.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you all for your feedback and bugs so far, it is incredibly helpful to us. <br />
<br />
Blue posts<br />
The future of Block<br />
I feel like we've been pretty candid about its future. You can probably find my previous comments relatively easily. We think block needs to mitigate much more incoming damage per hit, but to make that change we would also need to lower tank avoidance across the board and prevent every hit from being blocked (especially in situations with more than one target beating on you). To make Prot tanking more interesting, we have allowed block to become too much of a dps stat. In retrospect, we'd rather it remained a mitigation stat and that Strength was pushed up as the big warrior and paladin dps stat.<br />
<br />
You shouldn't overly worry about outscaling content. We said from the beginning that there would be three major patches to Wrath of the Lich King. We aren't setting up a system that is going to remain on autopilot for 10 more tiers of content without our intervention. It's totally valid for players to worry about scaling, and all things considered, we'd rather have mechanics that scale well. But if those scaling problems aren't going to manifest themselves until you have item level 500 items, then you're worried prematurely.<br />
<br />
We would like to get Prot warriors into PvP in a legitimate way, but our first priority is making sure every class has at least one viable PvP spec first. By &quot;legitimate&quot; I do NOT mean that you sometimes can do a 19K Shield Slam when all the stars align. That's not acceptable even if it is rare. Also consider that tanks do have a legit role acting like actual tanks when running flags or tanking AV-style NPCs. That may not be enough of a role, but I did want to point out that emphasizing BGs more and Arenas less also helps to carve out a niche for PvP tanks.<br />
<br />
I know there are plenty of Prot warriors out there who couldn't care less about PvP. Sorry. We have to. :(<br />
<br />
We want Prot warriors to do decent damage in PvE. We don't want them to do as good damage as actual dps specs -- there needs to be a trade-off for such high survivability. This means we need threat multipliers or you won't be able to actually hold aggro. It's okay if Shield Slam can make big (yet not absurd) numbers, since you don't Shield Slam all that much. That's fun. As I said above though, it would probably work better if Shield Slam hit hard because your Strength was high, not because you built a gimmicky set. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/18358911683-the-future-of-block.html))<br />
<br />
Avoidance changes in 3.2<br />
The main goal of the change was to make parry not so much less attractive than dodge as an avoidance stat. Since tank avoidance is so high already, we wanted to do that by nerfing dodge a little, not by buffing parry.<br />
<br />
This hurts druids slightly more than other tanks, but the emphasis is on &quot;slightly.&quot; This is not the big druid nerf that some forum posters have predicted. We will continue to evaluate tank survivability and threat generation based on PTR tests with &quot;Patchwerk&quot; to decide if druids need to be nerfed or DKs buffed or look at Prot warrior dps or anything else.<br />
<br />
This is also not the big avoidance &quot;come to Naaru&quot; that some posters predicted. Overall, we think avoidance is too high and the game would work better with lower tank avoidance, but suddenly dropping everyone's avoidance by 20 or 30% would be a very big change with many ramifications for healing and gear among other things. It would also feel like a big nerf to the many players who didn't understand why it would be better for the game in the long term. But I still expect it is coming at some point. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/18315580997-avoidance-change.html))<br />
<br />
Tanking - Threat Generation / DPS<br />
There has been a lot of discussion about +threat moves being a crutch and tanks should just be able to hold aggro based on their dps. But that implies that your dps is as high or higher than a class or spec who can only dps. There will probably be +threat added to stances and abilities for the foreseeable future. That does not mean your dps needs to be 10% of a dps raid member. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/18358911683-the-future-of-block.html))</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aranc</div><div class="date">2009-07-14, 07:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice changes for tanking I guess</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Samin</div><div class="date">2009-07-14, 07:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mh I don't get it. When I'm tanking I don't care for dps.. I want as much threat as possible and I don't care how. If it is the tanks dps that is missing to kill a boss, maybe the dps spec dps should be buffed instead (you know, thats why it is called &quot;dps spec&quot;)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baelzibub</div><div class="date">2009-07-14, 07:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I understand that some players, who have access to alot of gear have found a way to stack massive amounts of +SBV and possibly gem full Str in that set and in doing so have found a way to have a bit of fun in PvP. <br />
<br />
But how many are we talking about here? And how effective is it really? In such a build there is nothing majorly offensive, if you are not hitting that warrior he'll gain marginal rage, he is hard to kill, but easy to keep at bay.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gawrhshshsh</div><div class="date">2009-07-14, 07:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If a warrior is doing 500 less dps than the other tanks, and similar threat and survivability why let them tank?<br />
<br />
That is 500 less dps the raid is missing, and I know pretty much everyone out there has missed an enrage timer/similar time limit by a few seconds. Baked in threat is just a gimmick and leaves us in a terrible spot if we are the only one alive with the healer. <br />
<br />
Yes, those aren't ideal raid fights but not many are. Asking for higher dps to bring us on line with other tanks isn't too much to ask for, and don't even bring up the bastardized UA/revenge spam spec. It's a disgrace for anyone who values playing their warrior.<br />
<br />
I for one, am all for the scaling by strength though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why must it be possible for a prot Warri to do PvP ? I don´t get the point...<br />
We have already dual specc. Every Warri who wants to do PvP can use it.<br />
<br />
Block is fine as it is. We can tank all encounters in the game easily. NP.<br />
It would be better to change other things. <br />
Remove Respawn in an Ini. That would be a big change!<br />
<br />
But after all we know Blizzard will change it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BGs? What are those? It's all about Arena lately. BGs have mostly become grinds since Arena (and ranking-required gear) hit the scene.<br />
<br />
I mean, really. A tank flag carrier? That's crediting BG pugs with far too much organization. Premades, sure. But not your typical pug.<br />
<br />
Why do Prot warriors need to be pvp viable, especially with dualspec? I just don't understand the urgency. If you're that concerned with tank roles in pvp, give tank specs a skill/spell that forces their target to only attack them for a while, redirect damage to them (divine sacrifice kinda deal) or stuff like that. Still seems stupid and not-fun to me, though.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
On a different note, the confirmation of 3 major patches is cool. I'm starting to lose hope that there will be a Zul'Drak raid, though, which is disappointing. There was a troll raid in vanilla and BC, but if 3.2 is going to be all this tournament nonsense I'm guessing 3.3 will be Icecrown. Unless they release some sort of Zul'Drak raid to be worked on by guilds at the same time as Icecrown, there's not gonna be any room/time for it. Ah well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Biernot</div><div class="date">2009-07-14, 08:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are a few things I don't get:<br />
<br />
1. They said they want to buff tank damage a bit (at least for warriors), but a few days ago they nerfed SS damage.<br />
<br />
2. They nerfed SS damage because of pvp? Is pvprot op at the moment? And the reference to the slim chance of an 19k SS crit: Other classes can do equally or higher crits on a consistent basis (arcane mage anyone?)<br />
<br />
3. Tanking with damage vs. tanking with threat: All &quot;tanking stances&quot; (bear form, frost presence, righteous fury, defensive stance) have a threat multiplyer in it. So extra threat additions on abilities are kind of unnesseccary . If we have a system like &quot;tank dps x2 = tank threat&quot; then there is no need for extra threat on certain moves.<br />
<br />
But there is one thing I totally agree on: I would be stupid if a tank had the same dps as a dps-spec (or even near them). I think some players (and maybe some devs too) misunderstand the demands of certain (warrior-)tanks for more dps:<br />
a) they want similar dps as the other tanks. (prot warrior has inferior dps to other tanks)<br />
b) they want the extra threat removed from certain abilities and instead a little bit more dps to offset the change...</div></div><hr />

Only affects white hits, so the damage really is neglible.<br />

And the reason Parry sucks in its current state, is that not only does it require more parry rating for each % of actual parry when compared to dodge, it also hits diminishing returns sooner.</div></div><hr />

On that note, I keep getting 1 shot by Pallies in BG's. When I look at the combat log it says I was hit for like 468 (16452 overkill).

Oh and BlizzCon I assume will talk about 3.3 IC and/or Cataclysm.

The tanking idol comment is true, I'll give you that.<br />
<br />
<br />
So you think we have a great tanking ench for our weapon and moonkin dps is fine? You think it´s ok to nerf our avoidance while boosting mitigation for other tanks? Im confused</div></div><hr />

<br />
GC = drood hating retard<br />
<br />
<br />
I completely agree. My druid tank is just an alt, but I still very much noticed that there is no tanking Idol (until WAY late in Uld 25). Currently I'm using the Badge of Justice one from BC (ilvl ~120). I'm also using Mongoose on my weapon (a BC enchant) since nothing else really looks attractive.<br />
<br />
I haven't really complained since he is just my alt and because my guild's healers seem to be able to keep me up OK, but now they're nerfing dodge, our main stat. We can't really stack armor since we're already so close to the armor cap, and stacking stam doesn't help because when bosses hit you for like 20k, an extra 5k health doesn't really go that far.<br />
<br />
So maybe instead of (or in addition to?) buffing Warriors' dps, maybe they should buff Druid tanks.<br />
<br />
As always, Blizz seems to have a hard time with Feral druids since 2 roles are in one tree (kitty &amp; bear). One always gets neglected.<br />
<br />
To compensate for the idol: make idols dual purposed for kitty and bear, just like with tier gear since those are just like &quot;Feral&quot; instead of specifying kitty or bear. It looks like they are trying to do that for 3.2, but it's still sad that there's only ONE epic bear idol in the first 2 content patches for WotLK (I'm counting 3.0 as a content patch with Naxx, OS, and EoE).<br />
<br />
To compensate for the enchant: I think other tanks might like this too but just give us better options for weapon enchants like stam or avoidance.<br />
<br />
To compensate for the inevitable dodge nerf: Raise our armor cap? Make armor resist spell damage too, at least to a degree? Convert a % of our dodge to just % damage reduction? You have to give us something or else Warriors and more like Palis are going to be the only tanks around.<br />

We will continue to evaluate tank survivability and threat generation based on PTR tests with &quot;Patchwerk&quot; to decide if druids need to be nerfed or DKs buffed or look at Prot warrior dps or anything else.<br />
<br />
OK, couple of things here. They admit druids are getting hurt more and then they hint that they may be nerfing us more! I admit I haven’t been keeping up on PTR info mostly because as a Feral druid I don’t want to think about 3.2. So after reading the above I clicked on the patch notes and read the following:<br />
<br />
•Agility: The amount of agility required per percentage of dodge has been increased by 15%. This change required recalibrating the amount of dodge a player has with 0 agility by a slight amount as well, so all players will see their dodge percentage vary a small amount.<br />
•Block Value: The amount of bonus block value on all items has been doubled. This does not affect the base block value on shields or block value derived from strength.<br />
•On-Use Block Value Items: All items and set bonuses that trigger temporary increases to block value have been modified. Instead of increasing their block value amount by 100% like other items, they have all had their effect durations doubled. This applies to Glyph of Deflection, Gnomeregan Autoblocker, Coren's Lucky Coin, Lavanthor's Talisman, Libram of Obstruction, Tome of the Lightbringer, Libram of the Sacred Shield, the tier-8 paladin Shield of Righteousness bonus, the tier-5 paladin Holy Shield bonus, and the tier-5 warrior Shield Block bonus.<br />
•Dodge Rating: The amount of dodge rating required per percentage of dodge has been increased by 15%. This is before diminishing returns. Combined with other changes, this makes dodge rating and parry rating equally potent before diminishing returns apply.<br />
<br />
So I then decided to take a look at Warrior and Pally tanks on my server and as I suspected 0 agility on their gear. WTF, if you want to nerf dodge then nerf dodge don’t mess with agility. You buffed shield carrying tanks and Nerfed Druids without any way of making up for it. Well at least we still have great dps in cat form, ohh yeah forgot that gets nerfed in 3.2 too. O’well I still have my epic frost gear socketed with all 24 stam gems! I can’t wait for all the fun nerfs us ferals get in 3.2 best of all I get to stare at my metrosexual Hello kitty and Fat ass bear with retarded arm bands and Elvis sideburns.</div></div><hr />

But that crit you list above was probably their ranged execute move. I know on my hunter my kill shot will crit for 12k or so but that's not representative of one of my regular/special shots.

Ready? I'm beggin' for em. I'm of the opinion that Arena has sufficiently ruined (EDIT: Okay, ruined is a strong word, but it's caused a lot of problems for:) PvE and non-arena PvP. Every time they &quot;fix&quot; something so it's &quot;more balanced&quot; in arena, it throws everything else for that class and/or spec and/or stat out of alignment. To add insult to injury, we still see entire seasons go by with one class that is obviously superior in Arena.<br />
<br />
I couldn't be happier if they just removed arena outright. Let the leet pvpers measure their epeens through dueling or calling each other out on realm forums (cross-faction) for duels elsewhere, shift the focus of pvp back to BGs and world PvP.<br />
<br />
But I'm probably in the minority there, and I'm sure somebody will reply to this with, &quot;You just dislike Arena because you suck at it.&quot;<br />
<br />
I think the real problem with Arena is that the game designers keep clinging to the philosophy that &quot;Arena, PvP, and PvE are all the same game in WoW.&quot; So, they strongly resist having skills that have different functions in pvp and pve. They're trying to 'balance' classes for two different games, and to boot they're resisting homogenization (rather poorly at the moment, probably due to the community's mass amounts of QQ about 'OP' classes/skills/whatever). Accept what the gamers already know: Arena is different from PvP (because in PvP numbers give the advantage), and Arena is different from PvE. Treat them as such, design for them as such. Would save a lot of work in the long run.<br />

<br />
Well, no, you really don't, you could just fucking ignore it (or better yet, remove it).<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, people still PVP.=P<br />
<br />
They want to figure out a way to nerf PVP while keeping PVE the same, but they seem to refuse to change it so abilities act differently in a BG or Arena or Duel setting. That, in my mind, is just making a small problem worse. Even a shmuck can figure out how to make Viper Sting suck up mana in a slower pace against a player while keeping it the same it is now against an NPC.<br />
<br />
It would require a bit of retooling, I know, but it would keep my damn SS crits. I want them to do it. It would probably harm world PVP in the end, as that would probably be too hard to retool, but I don't care. I'd rather they start treating PVP and PVE as two separate creatures and change one while keeping the other out of their minds. It would be much better than seeing the problem with Prot Warrior DPS, and nerfing one of their basic moves to do LESS DPS. <br />
<br />
It's mind-boggling how they're going about this. At this rate, the Warrior DPS problem can only be solved by nerfing the other 3 classes, and I doubt anyone would want that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Only thing I have to say bout this, is who the F cares about prot warriors!!. I dont. I am more intresting to know is about Prot Paladins. Blues should have mentioned things about Pally tanks not warrior tanks.<br />
<br />
Oh, you'll get nerfed out of this, too. Lore from Tankspot put it out nicely that the DR part of Shield of Righteousness might be more of a problem than the DR part for Shield Block for Warriors.<br />
<br />
Problem was, you weren't the tank that does the least DPS, so the only thing you'll lose out of this is a bit of threat and maybe some DPS. The problem is that Warrior tank DPS is bad compared to the other classes, and if our mitigation and survival skills are all the same, then which classes would you think a guild would take?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only world PVP I've ever experienced is:<br />
<br />
1) Getting jumped by (and usually ganked by) a stealthed Rogue or Druid while I tried to quest or do dailies<br />
2) Getting jumped by several people working in concert while I tried to do dailies or quest<br />
3) Getting jumped by some douchebag while I was fighting 1 or more mobs and was down to half my health and mana...the mob being something I was killing as I tried to quest or do dailies.<br />
4) Getting jumped by someone as I was leveling who was 20+ levels over me...while I was trying to quest to level.<br />
5) Having to fight our way into a raid or instance because the other faction was feeling surly.<br />
<br />
World PVP is nothing but an annoyance in its present state. All it does is slow down the game with pointless drivel that adds nothing but frustration and ePeen bloat for idiots that are a waste of life. =) There's no 'spice' added, unless the spice in question is dried bat guano.<br />
<br />
Nothing says 'asshat' like slaughtering lowbies...except slaughtering quest givers, flight masters, bankers and auctioneers. Fortunately there are dedicated douchebags determined to revel in their asshattery.<br />

I would be delighted if there wasn't any PVP at all. As numerous posters have pointed out Blizzard has no damn clue how to balance PVP with PVE, buffing one invariably breaks the other and vice versa. It is really irritating.</div></div><hr />

I feel like we've been pretty candid about its future. You can probably find my previous comments relatively easily. We think block needs to mitigate much more incoming damage per hit, but to make that change we would also need to lower tank avoidance across the board and prevent every hit from being blocked (especially in situations with more than one target beating on you). &quot;<br />
<br />
I don't see why that has to be the case. In BC it ws very easy for paladins to be block capped so that every hit was a block, miss, dodge, or parry. No one claimed this was OP back in the day, it was just a different style of tanking that was unique to the paladin. I am not sure where the problem arises. Even if they doubled total block value(instead of just value from the block value stat itself), very few tanks would get above 4-4.5K block value, so stopping 4000 instead of 2000 out of 20K isn't that huge of an issue.<br />
<br />
I have no been on the ptr but that is how it seems to me without playing the ptr.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Biernot</div><div class="date">2009-07-15, 12:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see why that has to be the case.

The Problem is not the block value when you are tanking ulduar hardmodes. If you balance block value around these bosses, then block becomes totally op in lower tiers of raiding. Or in other words:<br />
Not a problem: Blocking 4k out of a 20k hit.<br />
A problem: Blocking 4k out of a 3.5k hit.<br />
<br />
The real problem with block is it's basic nature: it does not work relative, but in absolute terms. Absolute numbers do not scale, relative ones do. This is why talents are always relative (&quot;Increases the damage of XXX by 2%&quot;) and items are always absolute (&quot;Increases the AP by 132&quot;). And this is also why they introduced the combat ratings when TBC came. There is still one level 60 item around (Darkmoon Card: Blue Dragon), which works in relative terms. And to no surprise, it is still viable, because it scales with the rest of your gear.<br />
<br />
Long story short: They need to make block work relative, or at least partly relative. e.g.:<br />
- Block now mitigates a percentage of the hit, rather than a fixes value. It could have a fixed small base amount (like the natural block amount on your shield, which would be a bit over 200 for current shields)***<br />
- Convert &quot;block value&quot; to &quot;block value rating&quot;. BVR is subject to diminishing returns (caps at 25% or something like that).***<br />
<br />
-&gt; Result: Block now works against hard hitting raid bosses, without beeing op in easier content (heroics, naxx 10, ...)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*** The numbers are just random examples. What the actual numbers have to be, remains to determine.</div></div><hr />

Not being able to use shred is crap as mangle is just really poor. I personally play resto in pvp, and i /lol even harder when I see I feral than when I see a ret pally trying to kill me. <br />

And that nonsense about ToL form? what is GC smoking? What resto druids want to be constantly shifting in and out of ToL??</div></div><hr />
