Lots of good news today for Diablo players in the 1.0.4 Systems preview on Diablofans (http://www.diablofans.com/news/1306-developer-blog-104-systems-preview/)!<br />

<br />
<br />
Monks Will be Able To Use Recruit a Friend Bonuses<br />
We're not making any changes to the way RaF bonuses function, which means monks won't be excluded from receiving the benefits of RaF when Mists of Pandaria is released. <br />
<br />
Will they still get realm first achievements?<br />
Yes. <br />
<br />
Will Scroll of Resurrection be available to instant level a monk to 80?<br />
No. That's answered here (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/232052-scroll-of-resurrection-update-for-mists-of-pandaria/). <br />
<br />
<br />
Theramore Event Will not Be Tested<br />
Is the World Event for the Attack on Theramore Isle going to be available for testing soon?<br />
We are not currently planning on opening this up for public/beta testing. That may change but for right now we're testing it internally.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Instead of releasing the expansion at/around the same as a competitors game (Guild Wars 2), they release the expansion aprox. 1 month after. Even if Guild Wars 2 isn't a subscription game, some may think (consciously/unconsciously) that the game HAS a subscription, and will likely &quot;quit&quot; within the first month. Leaving a perfect opportunity to &quot;return&quot; to WoW. Historically, Blizzard also tends to launch the &quot;pre-expansion patch&quot; about a month before the expansion. Which happens to be... around the time of Guild Wars 2 launch. Leaving people to decide either to play the new game, or return to WoW and try out all the new systems, talents etc.<br />
<br />
Guild Wars 2 launches on August 28th (preorders on the 25th). Doesn't take a rocket scientist, to assume that 5.0.4 is going live on either the 21st or 28th (22nd/29th for EU).</div></div><hr />

The release date for MoP is September 25th, so if the pre-xpac event lasts 2 weeks the earliest date for the patch hitting live would be Sept 11th. (I wonder if that could mean the beta will end around the start of the month...)<br />
<br />
Also, unless you have some proof like a piece of a Blizzard memo stating &quot;guild wars 2 oh noes!!!!111!1&quot;, you can quit it with all the gw2 conspiracy stuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
How long did it take between the time you could download 4.0.1 and its release? <br />
<br />
4.0.1 was 12th of October 2010, but when were you able to download it?<br />
I think think it was roughly a week prior to the patch going live. It should be noted that it was the first time you could pre-download the pre-expansion patch before patch day, so I wouldn't read too much into this quite yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It all depends if the PTR testing for 5.0.4 is complete so to speak, I'm not following its progress at all because I'm on the beta, and there's no blue post about that besides the maintenance stuff.<br />
Would appreciate any info on that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
16th September 2010 according to google for the background downloader. They give you a lot of time as it's such a big download.</div></div><hr />

they can grant you levels, its just SOR that doesnt work ..<br />
<br />
Which makes absolute sense. Your friend can only grant levels if he/she already has a higher level. And the granted levels are limited. It's not as extreme as the SOR instant lvl 80 with full premade gear and other noteworthy stuff</div></div><hr />

Yes because having the ability to insta get lvl 60 on a fresh ding if you had RAF levels to grant BEFORE the mop live date im sure wont get abused for realm 1st 's</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't have any such memo, no. But you can bet a memo along those lines sure as hell exists, somewhere within Blizzard HQ. Especially after the last financial report, stating a loss of 1.1 million subscribers over a 3 month period.<br />
<br />
I do on the other hand, have the virtue of having been around for the launch of every, single, expansion pack for WoW so far, and that experience tells me that the pre-expansion update generally arrives on the Live servers aprox. 2-4 weeks before launch of an expansion. Also, Blizzard has a habit of releasing updates around the launch of ANY competitors game and/or expansion pack. The Firelands update for example, launched right around the same time that RIFT was launched.</div></div><hr />

Preevent is not the same thing as the patch. Pre-event is Theramore stuff. THe patch 5.0 will probably be deployed earlier, in case something goes wrong. How earlier we do not know. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree, I see no reason why Blizzard couldn't release the pre-expansion patch earlier then the &quot;2 week&quot; notice we had regarding the Theramore event. It's not like that can't be turned on at that point. Release 5.0 as soon as possible give players a few extra days of playing with the new talents, glyphs,etc. <br />
<br />
Personally, I'm hedging a release on the 21st of August... Blizzard will like want everyone to have a &quot;taste&quot; so to speak of MOP to hedge off GW2 a week later. But who knows...</div></div><hr />

<br />
They said a while back (I think it was for the press event) that they were aiming to activate the pre-event about two weeks before launch. That was quite a while ago, but it's still the only thing we have to go on.<br />
<br />
That said, deploying the patch and activating the event are two different things entirely.</div></div><hr />

Indeed, that was the post.<br />
I really hope they changed their mind about that, because 2 weeks is a bit short for some classes to basically relearn their character.</div></div><hr />

<br />
TBC<br />
2.0.1 - TBC systems patch - Dec 5<br />
2.0.3 - TBC content patch - Jan 9 (5 weeks later)<br />
Release - Jan 16 (1 week later)<br />
6 weeks from systems to release<br />

3.0.2 - WotLK systems patch - Oct 14<br />

CATA<br />
4.0.1 - Cataclysm systems patch - Oct 12<br />
4.0.3a - The shattering - Nov 23 (6 weeks later)<br />
Release - Dec 7 (2 weeks later)<br />
8 weeks from systems to release<br />
<br />
It's currently 7 weeks to release so going on previous history, the patch could drop any week now. Aug 21 or Aug 28 are by far the most probable dates (it's very unlikely that it'll be this coming week since preloading just started today).<br />
<br />
You will also note that all of these expansions have had a balancing or extra patch after the systems patch but before the actual release - I don't think they'll have time to do that in 2 weeks and they'd have to be supremely confident to drop the systems patch that late.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, people were certain the Azeroth changes wouldn't be on PTR and that Pandaren would never be playable. Blizzard has patterns, but they do sometimes surprise.<br />
<br />
I am not saying I *know* when the patch will happen, I am just saying anything could happen.</div></div><hr />

You might want to look at the context in which I was referencing that. It was *not* to indicate that it was a matter of *exactly* two weeks. It was to: A. Prove Blizzard made comments on the timing of the patch (which someone earlier doubted) and B. Explain why some people think the two weeks comment was in regards to the patch, rather than the event. I believe I said earlier READ: in this same topic! that the schedule might have changed and that it could release at any time.<br />
<br />
Edit: And &quot;roughly&quot;, in regards to a time frame, is arbitrary. Personally, I would not consider a month to be roughly two weeks. Does Blizzard? I don't know. It really is silly to argue semantics over such an obscure and loosely used adverb.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Venteus</div><div class="date">2012-08-11, 12:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They won't release the skill updates (which will come with the patch, theramore event or not) without announcing the end of the pvp season.

so boys and girls what will it be if we had to choose:<br />

guild wars or wow <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raeion</div><div class="date">2012-08-11, 03:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard are pretty smart with the launch of Mists...<br />
<br />
Instead of releasing the expansion at/around the same as a competitors game (Guild Wars 2), they release the expansion aprox. 1 month after. Even if Guild Wars 2 isn't a subscription game, some may think (consciously/unconsciously) that the game HAS a subscription, and will likely &quot;quit&quot; within the first month. Leaving a perfect opportunity to &quot;return&quot; to WoW. Historically, Blizzard also tends to launch the &quot;pre-expansion patch&quot; about a month before the expansion. Which happens to be... around the time of Guild Wars 2 launch. Leaving people to decide either to play the new game, or return to WoW and try out all the new systems, talents etc.<br />
<br />
Guild Wars 2 launches on August 28th (preorders on the 25th). Doesn't take a rocket scientist, to assume that 5.0.4 is going live on either the 21st or 28th (22nd/29th for EU).<br />
<br />
exactly its all about timing , !</div></div><hr />

Maybe I'm just being stupid but surely this pre-patch won't have to include all the date for Pandaria and things like that yet? Just the new systems and such. I think 6gb looks about right when you think about it that way.</div></div><hr />

It said it's active in the PTR Patchnotes, which is coming to live before MoP so I'd say: yes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The complete MoP beta client (fresh installation) is only 20.9GB big and that's the size the live client has with the update files (shown as 21GB in the downloader).<br />
<br />
As for the release of the patch I would say that it won't be next week because warriors and death knights (and monks but that isn't important for the patch) aren't tuned for the new system. I'd guess the patch will be released on the 21st. That's another 2 weeks for balancing the classes and after the cinematic is released so that we get a nice and complete patch with the new cinematic when we start the game and all the system changes (except scenarios and pet battles) to play around for 5 weeks.</div></div><hr />

Also, unless you have some proof like a piece of a Blizzard memo stating &quot;guild wars 2 oh noes!!!!111!1&quot;, you can quit it with all the gw2 conspiracy stuff.<br />

Well, the MoP beta and MoP game is far from finished, and it looks like a rushed product a lot of it, it will need loads of patches before it will get decent because they are rushing it out, why they are rushing it, no one knows but blizzard, but hey they went from &quot;when it is ready too let's rus things quickly to get more money&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Hmmm, regarding D3, Making it easier is just so they can again make more money of the RMAH, nothing else, invulnerable minions wasnt' even hard to begin with, neither was fire shield, all you had to do was move a little bit and you would not get hit.</div></div><hr />

He never said there was an average of 7 weeks per event. Read it again. He said there was 7 weeks currently remaining until MoP, and the patch should drop Aug 21-28 (5-6 weeks out). So, you failed in your attempt to make someone else look bad.</div></div><hr />
