You also got some extra main stats, so your power shouldn't have changed significantly. It was a shift to move some power away from secondary stats so that a +10 item level piece of loot is almost always an upgrade.<br />
<br />
Well that's bullshit, I have 49% crit on Live and 41% on PTR (Minus the 5% across the board) It's still 3% less from that alone, plus another 2-3% from other secondaries.<br />
<br />
He literally just said you should lose 1-2% secondaries and it's confirmed i'll be losing 5-6%.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I actually enjoyed the tab targeting just before launch and launch. I don't know if I was getting lucky but it was working well. 7.1 came and just ruined it.<br />
<br />
It was tabbing to a close target in combat that I haven't already targeted before, after it hit all targeted enemies it went back to the first one. This was working amazing for multidotting.<br />
<br />
I couldn't figure out why people had issues until 7.1 where it changed for me on all characters. Now it is so god damn random.</div></div><hr />

The latest PTR build changed many of the Nighthold loot stats. This way the items cover some of the stats that you want.<br />
With six items in the set, you will have more choices to pick the four for the set bonus.<br />

Except it's.. not? They answered an important question pertaining to Warriors and stats, which was immediately denounced.<br />
<br />
DHs are completely built around their &quot;Momentum&quot; build. They pull great damage which I'm assuming is why you're denouncing it, but it's true that they have virtually no changeup in rotation. That is a problem.<br />
<br />
More-so, it's really not irrelevant. I'm a DK. I actually liked their answer about Unholy, even though I'm rolling Frost currently. So.. yeah.</div></div><hr />

I have a DH in our guild that likes the Momentum spec but the rest of the guild is tired of hearing him bitch about mechanics that stop him from flying around like a mad man. He literally starts crying when elerethe gives him the connect as he can't dps. Or he starts whining because he doesn't have any mobility to get out of crap because it is a part of his rotation. The only upside is we get to see him fly off cliffs when it glitches out.<br />
<br />
This is more for the people that need to listen to DH's complain about it but like the spec.</div></div><hr />

You maybe dont get iot. It is completely irrelevant because actions speak louder than words.<br />
<br />
Second, no DH dont pull great dmg. Fire mages pull great dmg. DH pulled (past tense) great AoE dmg, that however got nerfed. Right now their attempt to alter playstyles for DH is nerfing fury gen to the ground which by nerfing not only passive fury gen by DB but also nerfing a legendary which became a must have to compete which other classes such as ...you guessed it: fire mages.<br />
<br />
So there's nothing note worthy happening. And theres nothing happening for fury warriors. And maybe I didnt get their answer but since it isnt readable on this page it must be insignificant because the abstaracts on mmo champion usually are more than enough.</div></div><hr />

Throughput will always trump utility unless it's so situational or weak as to practically not be throughput at all.<br />
<br />
There's a reason way back in BC they separated elixirs into Battle and Guardian types. Nobody would ever have used the Guardian elixirs otherwise, because throughput will always be king.</div></div><hr />

The DH in your guild is bad then. Even with the tether your dps doesn't go to complete shit if people communicate and your guild has assigned lanes.<br />

Not to mention that comment about BM being more mobile is BS. Thinking that we are more mobile than survival is a joke and it does nothing for us anyway in PvE and in PvP we still get slowed and stunned like any other class but we have a shitty speed boost with AoC and Disengage can be stun blocked in mid-animation. But of course Blizzard's great idea to balance damage and class change is to mess up MM and change Survival's damage slightly whilst completely ignoring the last spec apart from changing one spell to a charge system and then only making it possible to use that charge system by getting a rare fucking legendary item that only increases the number of charges by one. Fucking A* work there me boyos.</div></div><hr />

I just want to play the game from different perspectives and roles, but not put another 2+ months of grinding in to do it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BannedForViews</div><div class="date">2016-12-07, 08:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Quality of Life improvements come from legendary items, just like they have from set bonuses and other items in the past. Most set bonuses are things players would like to have baked into their class, this is how the game has worked.&quot;<br />
<br />
This isn't exactly true. As a warlock, lets take a quick step back in time.<br />
<br />
T4 - increase corruption/immo duration 3 sec.<br />
T5 - increase corr/immo damage 5%.<br />
T6 - shadow bolt damage up 6%<br />
T7 - some crit chance, both random and static.<br />
T8 - Flat damage buff on signature skills and some crit chance on different ones.<br />
T9 - Flat crit and more flat damage to some main dot skills.<br />
<br />
The point is this stuff is pretty basic. Yea everyone wants all their skills to hit harder, and you would get a bonus from a set piece to do just that. What you didn't get was something like the current affliction gear where you need the legendary helmet to make agony ramp faster and generate more shards, or the T19 4 piece to increase the proc chance for shard generation, so that our rotation actually gets filled out and instead of spending a bunch of wasted time tunneling drains we had a lot of extra shards sitting around so we could actually use UA.<br />
<br />
Set bonuses were always extra icing, they were never the whole cake. That is where you made the mistake in many of these.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Farabee</div><div class="date">2016-12-07, 08:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason for the variance in number of Festering Wounds is to create some variation in your rotation, adding some decision making.<br />
<br />
Yeah, no. Sitting there autoattacking during your opener because you dumped all your runes and all your RP and can't Apoc doesn't require &quot;decision making&quot;, it just means you're screwed because you missed your burst window and will now be struggling to keep up with everyone else the rest of the fight. Frost actually gives you the resources to make decisions, regardless of your RNG. Unholy does not.<br />
<br />
<br />
One good community suggestion is capping the number of Wounds consumed at 4 and having 2 Ghouls summoned, making it never necessary to go to 8.<br />
<br />
This is a terrible change. The benefit of Apoc doesn't come from the ghouls, it comes from popping 8 wounds on a target and the resulting shadow damage (mainly via Bursting Sores) and rune return via Pestilant Pustules. Apoc is a rune-free way to exchange your wounds for damage and additional resources, and this change would likely kill that build unless wound damage was upped and PP returned to return a rune every 3 sores.<br />
<br />
Now, this change would work if you decoupled the spec from the almost codependent-level reliance on the FW mechanic. Which was a viable option in Beta when Clawing Shadows was a thing. But you absolutely murdered that spec, so here we are.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, this Q&amp;A has made me very happy I switched to Frost over a month ago. Because it's pretty clear the devs have absolutely no idea how to make Unholy work in the context of their &quot;zit popping&quot; design that they seem so doggedly determined to marry it to.</div></div><hr />

also outlaw atm need to fix him...instead to fix him you nerf him more and more and more and u will continue the nerf....and what balance are u speak about? lets see the talents between 3 specs...outlaw talents 30...Hook (when assassin-sub have shadowsteep by default) and they have to choose between Nightstalker,Sabterfuge and shadow focus)...talent 90 outlaw haves to choose alacrity because of stupid energy reg atm is crap and rest specs they have to choose between ability's that they do more and more dmg so outlaw cant use Cannonball barrage since is a pirate or killing spree ....and last talent 100....marked of death of course for outlaw to help him to do dmg and rest specs they have much more better talents for more energy help.. GREAT WORK<br />
also bad luck and bullshits with legendary most top rogues they have 4-5-6-7-8-9 all maybe and some other they have 3-4 and the 3 are for garbage ...who the hell told u I will spam feint to get heals...heal is not a job of a dmg dealer that is a job for healer...are u plan to fix the legendary rng....because u always speak about bad luck.....how is it possible CASUALS and TOP GUILDS to have all the best legendary and rest of us to have all the crap ..... <br />
also are u plan to fix the issue for outlaw rogue with Fortunes boon...because for me it says adrenaline rush 3 mins cd and with Fortunes Boon it should be 2 min and 35 sec cd...but it says 2min 58 sec cd...<br />

A good example would be the comment about talents. Saying 'they're all viable look at warcraft logs!' when some are blatently trash is, unfortunately, not particularly helpful.

Willing to bet the theory that less wounds and fewer ghouls won't actually transition over to the overall damage of either one resulting in unrecoverable nerf. Just speculating but I am going off the same notion they probably have that nerfing the only thing that made the spec competitive (bracers) actually helped in some way. I think it is fairly undeniable, they are out to make it the worst spec in the game. I mean we are dead last on the overall meters already. The only thing that is keeping Frost in the game is that the spec is not dead last, just second to last.</div></div><hr />

<br />
More to the point, it's a bad system that shouldn't have never made it into the game since the classes / specs are balanced around having them. How can you compete with other players when you don't have you BiS Legendaries. This is by far the worst expansion for class balance and Ion doesn't seem to understand this. Yes class balance is never going to be perfect but it's never been this bad, and Legendaries are the core problem to this.<br />
<br />
Another issue is CRZ they seem to be ignoring, why not just merge servers or create new servers and give people / guilds 1 month to transfer to these new servers with faction balancing - aka consolidate the server / population issue. It's a quick and simple fix yet they will not do it out of pride and trying to cover up the fact the game is slowly dying. It's better to be proactive than reactive as it can save time and money as well as making people more happy since it's showing that Blizzard cares. Also each server still has its own cluster, I've had times in Legion where I've only see people from my realm while in the quite hours of the morning. It's not like they are saving money and doesn't make sense to piss of your customer base with such foolish views since you will drive people slowly away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I felt this way after the first Q&amp;A I ever saw him do. He did nothing to calm any of my concerns and gave me the impression he didn't care much at all about the players, especially those who had problems with current class balance. Lore as well, its one thing to make a joke about a class getting nerfed, but when you are a community manager dealing with players who are feeling flat out ignored after months of alpha/beta and live feedback that is the last thing you should do. <br />
<br />
I don't think Ion is clueless. I think he just doesn't care. <br />
<br />
After seeing that earlier QA I decided to end my sub knowing I had a few months left on it and plenty of time to reverse that decision if Blizzard showed any progress in fixing any of my own concerns. The list started getting longer rather than shorter. My actual sub ran out today, but I haven't even logged in in over two weeks.</div></div><hr />

I find it odd, that the lead narrative dev, Kosak, left the game, and there's very little comment, either from Blizzard, or from the fanbase, other than &quot;thank god!&quot;.<br />
<br />
I didn't really think about it, after Metzen leaving, it's kind of hard to top that.<br />
<br />
But their lead narrative guy...the guy in charge of story...left before the expansion is even halfway done. Which means he didn't finish the story.<br />
<br />
What the hell is going on in irvine? Did Kosak leave because a really shitty end to the expansion was being forced on him? The first major patch of the game is for tweaks, but a signature class of the game, warlocks, are broken and won't be fixed until later, and their lead dev said that about another class. <br />
<br />
They started Legion strong, but the wheels are falling off, and they're spraying sparks everywhere. It's bad enough that a fan boy like Kosak bailed? (or worse, forced out). <br />

<br />
When will they finally get it. &quot;Over time the team will continue to increase the drop rate of legendary items. Someone who starts the game later this year will be more likely to get their legendary item than someone did back during Legion launch week.&quot; This not a fix to legendaries.<br />
Being better of just creating a new character, because you got unlucky on your legendaries is the most broken mechanic, that has ever been in WoW.<br />
I hope they're going to acknowledge that at some point, especially if you're planning to play off specs or need to roll another spec, because of their numbers tuning.</div></div><hr />

I'm kind of fed up with the developers by now. One or two months ago they talked about a redesign of fury in 7.1.5 to address the daring issues the spec has. Now they don't even mention the spec in the interview regarding class changes, implying that there won't be any changes for fury warriors at all (except some minor talent changes). The spec is so clunky to play in PvE and utter garbage in PvP it's not even funny. This whole development, or rather lack of development, makes me really mad. I might take a break from WoW for a while - it's just too frustrating.</div></div><hr />

My hubby is about to rage quit for good after I got him to start playing again 2 months ago. I have 1 legendary, and every day he plays without getting one makes him dislike the game more. He just wants to get better at the game while being too busy for raids and dungeons, and it hasn't been a problem until now where there is literally no way for him to &quot;control&quot; how he can get a legendary. It's just stupid at this point, and they need to realize that.<br />
<br />
If he isn't doing dungeons or raids then he is only doing his emmisary quest and logging off?? No wonder he hasn't gotten a legendary. You only get a chance at legendaries from Emmisary, raids, dungeons, or Army training. Don't complain he isn't getting an item when he isn't doing the content that gives it. It isn't RNG, he just plain isn't doing the content to get it. Just doing Emmisary quests is a low chance of getting one. The bad luck protection isn't built up from that very fast.</div></div><hr />

NO GUYS THE MISTAKE WAS PUTTING IT BEHIND AN RNG WALL. You can offer people powerful loot ON A VENDOR. Then the sting of getting sephuz is who gives a shit. Yes sephuz and prydaz is bad and i'm not sure how excited you would be for them EVEN WITHOUT dps legendaries. The procs kinda suck in the current iteration.

<br />
What Ion does NOT understand is this: People play this game because they want to roleplay in a fanfasy world, as a char of their own choosing, and making said char more powerful - its the feeling of PROGRESS and having a goal that people enjoy. There is a major feeling of satisfaction involved in reaching a goal for players. Clearing all mythic dungeons, getting into your first raid, getting full epic quality gear, killing xavious on heroic etc etc. All those GOALS are a part of your character progress, and people want to see it THROUGH to the end. <br />
<br />
When you mix in very powerful optainable legendary items into this progress, you force people into doing an unhealthy amount of farm content because of the chance of getting that very powerful item. The idea that players have some items to work on finding throughout the entire expansion is great, but those items should never give you a massive edge over others in your over-all preformance. BUT THEY DO! and thats the problem! <br />
<br />
The most pathetic point about this whole topic, is the fact that it would be so damn easy to fix. Targetable legendaries og a vendor that would let you trade your excisting legendaries ONCE for another are just two quick ideas.<br />
<br />
I have currently around 400 mythic+ dungeon clears on my main, been raiding on mythic diff. almost since release, and doing emmisary quests every day. With a total of /played 30 days at max lvl, im still only sitting with two avarage legendaries for ONE spec. <br />
My alt has a total of 4 days at max level - so i'll just let you imagine how little i've played that character and yet, I ALSO have two legendaries on that toon. That should not be fucking possible! I dont mind some healthy RNG, but this is retarded. <br />
<br />
Do I feel motivated to farm even more mythic+ dungeons for NEW legendaries when they add them to the game? Fuck off.<br />
Do I feel motivated to play off-specs without legendaries, knowing that I'll obviously preform below what my mainspec would do? Fuck off.<br />
I play Feral druid with two avarage legendaries. Do I feel motivated to farm more content form better legendaries when I know there is a 50% chance that my next legendary will be a worthless ring/neck? Fuck off. <br />

<br />
This is a very well written post, that summarises my thoughts precisely. <br />
<br />
I haven't played as much as you did this expansion, but agree that when effort != result, it feels shit overall. <br />
<br />
Also, token system for legendaries that allows anyone &quot;buy&quot; a legendary that they want - DPS or utility one, depending on what rocks their boat would immediately stop the whole Sephuz-Prydaz debate. <br />
<br />
They are stubborn. Haven't you learned from the whole No-Flying in Draenor debacle?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redecle</div><div class="date">2016-12-08, 01:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looking at the last intended version of Slice and Dice, the +15% energy regen on top of Attack Speed. I don't even care what you do with RTB anymore.<br />
I haven't touched RTB, i will not touch it, it deserves to die in the last level of hell. Keep it in or don't, i don't care.<br />
But if you want to make SnD a choice, keep at it. Somehow i doubt that +15% regen is not enough, even though it's stable improvement, RtB will still have True Bearing.<br />
I'd wish we'd have Ruthlessness as it was and all would be forgiven, RtB could float on his own magnificence at that point, rolling the animation on endless loop, in some dark corner of the Twisting Nether, never to be seen again.<br />
Possibly more haste.. Come on then let's have it. The world has unlimited haste resources, take some and place it here, I want to see passive 100% uptime Adrenaline Rush on steroids from all that haste, on top of the normal AR cooldown. Go crazy with it, let's see how many people really, I mean really love RtB after that, or any other class at that point. Who needs to be skill capped when you can be energy capped. You'd need at least 7 parallel monitors to occupy all the UI energy bars.<br />
<br />
The legendaries, now after receiving 2 completely useless ones, i'm done. I'm going to put on my warglaives go to the woods and chop some boars.<br />
Glad that Sephuz is at least getting some sort of interesting buff with interrupts being in the mix, cause the cc trigger was absolutely pointless in a game where there's no cc needed, not even in pvp cause everything dies inside of a global. At least being a 10 year Kick &quot;robot&quot; finally has a meaning. <br />
Still not happy that a human error cost me my second legendary, if you accidentally forget to be in the right loot spec, gaining a legendary on your spec that you never use is even more painful than getting one of the shitty ones, cause it's just completely pointless at that point. From that you can guess what my 2nd legendary was. Sin boots for my outlaw. Why aren't they dynamic? When you change the spec the boots for rogues as an example change to match the spec. Just like the tier bonuses do. Or make a gigantic notification that fills the entire screen at all times that the player is in the wrong loot specialization. Since that's the main tool that affects what is on the personal loot table, doing constant transmog runs and just current instance runs, I at least am constantly on every boss bases changing the loot spec. Forgetting it to a wrong setting was pretty much just a question of when more than if. And of course it's the time the legendary comes. I already know that i'm a moron, i don't need the game reminding me of that everytime a legendary drops.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Keep being stubborn and continue shoving the most useless legendary duo sephuz n prydaz down to players' throats, keep making these retarded decisions and see more players leave. <br />
<br />
Also reforging is literally THE SOLUTION to all these secondary stats and high ilvl gear not being an upgrade issue, but for some fucking reason these goons chose to ignore the most logical solution, reforging and went forward to wasting all time, effort and resources creating a half-assed solution. Mind boggling really. <br />
<br />
No effort needed , perfect solution vs quadruple ++ amount of effort to derive a half-assed solution no one knows whether it would work , and these devs went with the latter.

<br />
Okay, but we are the 4th month of the expansion, many people have good legendaries and many people have Sephuz's Secret, making them less good than the other players. Their rng chance was spent on Sephuz's Secret, whereas other folks weren't so unlucky and got nice items. Regardless of what the dev team thinks, the issue stands in the current game and no amount of &quot;we know players are unhappy getting it&quot; is doing anything to improve the bad experience. <br />
<br />
In the video Ion mentioned they can't go about deleting items now, referring to Sephuz's Secret. Only that they can and nobody will be sorry if they bloody deleted that misunderstanding and just gave a &quot;legendary token&quot; to compensate - you use the token and randomly get one of the other legendary items. <br />

It sounds like they simply dont know what their design goal is for them and what to introduce.<br />
<br />
On one hand they say they should be exciting and valuable. On the other they dont want them to be mandatory and say they should offer utility whilst nerfing mandatory legendaries for other classes.<br />

Then they go and introduce shit like this<br />

<br />
I find it odd, that the lead narrative dev, Kosak, left the game, and there's very little comment, either from Blizzard, or from the fanbase, other than &quot;thank god!&quot;.<br />
<br />
I didn't really think about it, after Metzen leaving, it's kind of hard to top that.<br />
<br />
But their lead narrative guy...the guy in charge of story...left before the expansion is even halfway done. Which means he didn't finish the story.<br />
<br />
What the hell is going on in irvine? Did Kosak leave because a really shitty end to the expansion was being forced on him? The first major patch of the game is for tweaks, but a signature class of the game, warlocks, are broken and won't be fixed until later, and their lead dev said that about another class. <br />
<br />
They started Legion strong, but the wheels are falling off, and they're spraying sparks everywhere. It's bad enough that a fan boy like Kosak bailed? (or worse, forced out). <br />

What the hell Blizzard?<br />
<br />
nothings special - people in there are just bored after working for 12 + years on same game - its quite clear that game is slwoly moving into stasis phase where there will be 50 difficulty levels of same content do cut down costs etc etc - i can bet you that by the end of legion 3/4 of team will be gone and 8.0 will be final expansion after which what await us will be just f2p , patches and nothing more . they are clealry working heavily on ways to utilize old world content (class campaign) and i bet we will see a lot more of it in incoming year as test before last and final expansion) - 7.0 we defeat legion , 8,0 we defeat void lords and boom azeroth is safe forever time to put down sword and shield and just enjoy beer in the inn in orgrimar/stormwind</div></div><hr />

Yes, it goes without saying. But we will be on a clean slate, same as everyone who didn't get Sephuz's. It's a matter of removing the most hated legendary, available to all classes and specs. Not a matter of giving everyone bis. <br />

Of course, the bigger issue is that there is a very heavy RNG system with diminishing returns, caps and what not, which rewards (or not) gameplay changing items.</div></div><hr />

But even if we removed the most hated Legendary, people would go on to demand the next one removed, and the next one, until the only legendaries left are the ones that provide the highest numbers in terms of damage, rendering the whole system pointless.

In my opinion, none of (or all of, either or) the legendarys should be a performance increase. They should have been a stat bonus from their high ilvl plus some utility. Aggs boots for example, nice QoL change for some melee, but doesnt change performance other than movement. Versus the unholy bracers, where if you dont have them you might as well play frost or make a new dk and hope you do get them. They started out with a good idea, then went full retard when they decided it was ok if someone doesnt get the huge performance items, when clearly its not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Indeed. Since the purpose of legendaries are to be fun, interesting and something you swap around based on the situation, there shouldn't be any legendaries that provide additional damage, as that will always be go-to choice.<br />
<br />
At this point I'm not sure how they could solve it though, changing the existing legendaries from their current purpose probably won't happen, be it utility or dps, and they can't even move on during this expansion by letting them fall behind in ilevel, since they have already stated that your legendary will be relevant throughout the entire expansion. They have kind of painted themselves into a corner on this one I'm afraid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What Ion does NOT understand is this: People play this game because they want to roleplay in a fanfasy world, as a char of their own choosing, and making said char more powerful - its the feeling of PROGRESS and having a goal that people enjoy. There is a major feeling of satisfaction involved in reaching a goal for players. Clearing all mythic dungeons, getting into your first raid, getting full epic quality gear, killing xavious on heroic etc etc. All those GOALS are a part of your character progress, and people want to see it THROUGH to the end. <br />
<br />
When you mix in very powerful optainable legendary items into this progress, you force people into doing an unhealthy amount of farm content because of the chance of getting that very powerful item. The idea that players have some items to work on finding throughout the entire expansion is great, but those items should never give you a massive edge over others in your over-all preformance. BUT THEY DO! and thats the problem! <br />
<br />
The most pathetic point about this whole topic, is the fact that it would be so damn easy to fix. Targetable legendaries og a vendor that would let you trade your excisting legendaries ONCE for another are just two quick ideas.<br />
<br />
I have currently around 400 mythic+ dungeon clears on my main, been raiding on mythic diff. almost since release, and doing emmisary quests every day. With a total of /played 30 days at max lvl, im still only sitting with two avarage legendaries for ONE spec. <br />
My alt has a total of 4 days at max level - so i'll just let you imagine how little i've played that character and yet, I ALSO have two legendaries on that toon. That should not be fucking possible! I dont mind some healthy RNG, but this is retarded. <br />
<br />
Do I feel motivated to farm even more mythic+ dungeons for NEW legendaries when they add them to the game? Fuck off.<br />
Do I feel motivated to play off-specs without legendaries, knowing that I'll obviously preform below what my mainspec would do? Fuck off.<br /> 
I play Feral druid with two avarage legendaries. Do I feel motivated to farm more content form better legendaries when I know there is a 50% chance that my next legendary will be a worthless ring/neck? Fuck off. <br />
<br />
Blizzard is killing this expansion slowly, and I pains me to see it happen, since it really did have so much potential.<br />
<br />
We already know that from other xpacs. They hardly change their ideas unless it's just killing the income really fast (like wotlk easy pve or cataclysm hard pve, etc.). We saw that in WoD where they've got the feedback about how boring and bad garrisons were... and they just kept expanding on it with the shipyard and etc.<br />
<br />
If they get a huge drop in their subs with people claiming the reason to drop it being the legendary system, they'll probably go do something. People complain a lot, but they still pay, and with these, there is the extremelly vocal players that don't need that power increase (mostly because they don't do high level M+ or Mythic raids or don't care about coordinated group activity at all. Activities that said legendaries make a huge diference to the point of removing a class/spec from it) and these legendaries are just for fun, D3 style. They're just there beign vocal about how the system is awesome. So, for Blizzard, it is &quot;whatever, let's keep going with it&quot;.<br />
<br />
Really, while we had DKs totally screwed up as an example, I had a friend saying that there was nothing wrong with the classes overall and legion was the best xpac he ever played... because he was playing with one of the overpowered classes at the moment. Unfortunatelly it takes time for Blizzard to actually understand that this kind of feedback is basically null and get to the real feedbacks. <br />
<br />
After all, it's the human nature to put the positive stuff like my friend's &quot;best xpac eveeeeeerrr!&quot; above negative stuff that exposes a problem.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jimm3</div><div class="date">2016-12-08, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ion's team thinks that using solutions that worked in the past means admitting that past dev teams were better at game design than they are.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately whether they admit it or not, it's always going to be true.<br />
<br />
I don't think this is the reason.<br />
Blizzard stated in the past that reforging was not intuitive gameplay... you needed an addon or a website to tell you what and how to reforge.<br />
That in itself is just bad game design. So they removed it</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Clbull</div><div class="date">2016-12-08, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Legion flattened out the rate at which secondary stats scale over the max-level period of the expansion. The team wanted to start you out with higher levels of Crit and Haste and not let you get to such extreme levels at the end of the expansion. In the past specs would not play well at lower gear levels early in the expansion and then end up hitting soft caps near the end of the expansion.<br />
<br />
I would really prefer it if Blizzard didn't do this, and just let secondary stats exponentially scale as they used to.<br />
<br />
Right now, stats in general are far more boring than they used to be. Strength, Agility and Intellect used to provide multiple buffs but are now an overglorified form of attack power that may as well all be merged into one stat type because they do the same frickin' thing. I miss the days when Strength granted Block Value, Intellect offered an increased mana pool and spell crit chance, and when Agility gave you ranged attack power plus physical crit chance.<br />
<br />
Then we have the secondary stats, and there are literally just four. Critical Strike for increasing your chance of a critical blow, Mastery for &quot;making your character better at what it does&quot; which is often the worst stat for most specs in this expansion, Haste for attack speed, cooldown reduction and resource regeneration, and Versatility which is an incredibly boring 'catch all' stat that increases your damage dealing, healing and damage reduction. Haste is the one that most calculators tell DPS and healers to drop everything into while Versatility is oddly favoured by tanks only, because it's the only one to offer flat, consistent damage reductiion.<br />
<br />
Secondary stats were so much better and so much more interesting when Parry, Crit, Block Chance, Block Value, Spell Penetration, Hit, Expertise, Spirit/MP5 and Defense were a thing. Some may call things like the &quot;defense cap&quot; or &quot;hit cap&quot; arbitrary numbers which you must hit to survive or deal the most damage, but they led to incredibly interesting gameplay. Tanks used to avoid and mitigate attacks a lot more back in the day and it's this which made your character feel powerful. Healers also used to scale exponentially with both increased spell power and mana reserves. It was also so much better when Reforging and Valor Points were a thing because it gave you a safety net when you got craptacular drops and drop rates.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that literally makes no sense... The idea behind feedback is to see how the customers respond to your product. Your logic is wierd. Why on earth would it benefit blizz to hide/ignore negative feedback?<br />
<br />
I would argue the opposite actually. If you buy a product, and you are happy about it, it gives you the entertainment that you expected, I doubt that you would walk an extra mile to report this to the company.<br />
On the other hand - if you buy a product that doesnt live up to your expectations, you are probably more likely to make a rant about it to friends, forums, social media etc.</div></div><hr />

A legendary has always been about DPS, besides the few odd ones, the majority of them were all dps increase. <br />
So why put utility on it?. Utility was taken away from class talent trees and baseline talents. Does anyone see the repetitive &quot;creativity&quot;?. <br />
<br />
Classes need &quot;Talents back&quot; not new legendary's, In order for anyone to obtain utility they need an item which is 9/10 random to get &quot;as a legendary&quot;. It's just another failed design, and they were more proud to introduce&quot;more legendary's&quot; rather than fix classes lol. Class talents? or legendary's?. That's where blizzard is failing in Legion and if not fixed, It'll be another expansion that failed.</div></div><hr />

The fix is to make the better alternatives more bad, so Sephuz's Secret looks less horrible in comparison. <br />
<br />
Okay, but we are the 4th month of the expansion, many people have good legendaries and many people have Sephuz's Secret, making them less good than the other players. Their rng chance was spent on Sephuz's Secret, whereas other folks weren't so unlucky and got nice items. Regardless of what the dev team thinks, the issue stands in the current game and no amount of &quot;we know players are unhappy getting it&quot; is doing anything to improve the bad experience. <br />
<br />
In the video Ion mentioned they can't go about deleting items now, referring to Sephuz's Secret. Only that they can and nobody will be sorry if they bloody deleted that misunderstanding and just gave a &quot;legendary token&quot; to compensate - you use the token and randomly get one of the other legendary items. <br />
Done! <br />
Fixd!<br />
<br />
The fix will make it worst....only for dungeons will be ok for raid it will sucks since none boss except the sisters at Cenarius for dps is the only interrupt...so only class that can dispel they will use that item like healers and spriests ... so don't look only the fix look further...<br />

<br />
Looking at the last intended version of Slice and Dice, the +15% energy regen on top of Attack Speed. I don't even care what you do with RTB anymore.<br />
I haven't touched RTB, i will not touch it, it deserves to die in the last level of hell. Keep it in or don't, i don't care.<br />
But if you want to make SnD a choice, keep at it. Somehow i doubt that +15% regen is not enough, even though it's stable improvement, RtB will still have True Bearing.<br />
I'd wish we'd have Ruthlessness as it was and all would be forgiven, RtB could float on his own magnificence at that point, rolling the animation on endless loop, in some dark corner of the Twisting Nether, never to be seen again.<br />
Possibly more haste.. Come on then let's have it. The world has unlimited haste resources, take some and place it here, I want to see passive 100% uptime Adrenaline Rush on steroids from all that haste, on top of the normal AR cooldown. Go crazy with it, let's see how many people really, I mean really love RtB after that, or any other class at that point. Who needs to be skill capped when you can be energy capped. You'd need at least 7 parallel monitors to occupy all the UI energy bars.<br />
<br />
The legendaries, now after receiving 2 completely useless ones, i'm done. I'm going to put on my warglaives go to the woods and chop some boars.<br />
Glad that Sephuz is at least getting some sort of interesting buff with interrupts being in the mix, cause the cc trigger was absolutely pointless in a game where there's no cc needed, not even in pvp cause everything dies inside of a global. At least being a 10 year Kick &quot;robot&quot; finally has a meaning. <br />
Still not happy that a human error cost me my second legendary, if you accidentally forget to be in the right loot spec, gaining a legendary on your spec that you never use is even more painful than getting one of the shitty ones, cause it's just completely pointless at that point. From that you can guess what my 2nd legendary was. Sin boots for my outlaw. Why aren't they dynamic? When you change the spec the boots for rogues as an example change to match the spec. Just like the tier bonuses do. Or make a gigantic notification that fills the entire screen at all times that the player is in the wrong loot specialization. Since that's the main tool that affects what is on the personal loot table, doing constant transmog runs and just current instance runs, I at least am constantly on every boss bases changing the loot spec. Forgetting it to a wrong setting was pretty much just a question of when more than if. And of course it's the time the legendary comes. I already know that i'm a moron, i don't need the game reminding me of that everytime a legendary drops.<br />
<br />
My friend outlaw atm is broken...they add a nice ability RtB is pretty awesome...but the prob with it is u may roll 1 for 3-5 times in a row or u can roll 6(in a week u will maybe see that once)so or u will be king and top dps or garbage there is no middle... really I boost again sub ....but who tells Blizz that ppl they want to play sub or assassin ppl they should have the choice to choose what they want to play and Blizz is not doing that....u want to play outlaw ok at start of exp it was nice and many ppl they play it...oooppp outlaw is doing pretty good dmg NERF him..28% nerf at run though...boost assassin now assassin is good opppp nerf assassin and buff sub......FUKC OF</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they're going to do something to make it less crappy, either make it an on-use effect with a CD, or a random proc. The latter fitting completely in line with their RNG RNG RNG RNG mentality of this expansion. As an affliction warlock, I shouldn't have to use a specific pet, spec into mortal coil, or cast fear just to make use of this item. Because I'm sure the rest of the group will LOVE having mobs just running around like r-tards just so I can get a short haste buff. Also, WHY DO SNARES NOT COUNT AS LOSS OF CONTROL. Also WHY IS THIS ON THE RESTO DRUID LOOT TABLE? Am I expected to stop healing to cast entangling roots randomly to get the buff? <br />

There have been attempts to fix it so far, but it hasn't been fixed for everyone.<br />

I just SIMC (1 ennemie 300 sec lenght) my dps with my two actual legendaries (aggramar &amp; justice gaze) and obtained the result of 453k dps. <br />
I did the same with the same stuff (replaced helm and foot with the highest i had in my bag) but with the two bis leg for ret (nathrezim's cloack &amp; liandrin ring) and obtained the result of... 504k dps.<br />
<br />
That's a fucking huge 51K difference between two set of legendaries. What is the fucking point of introducing such an unfair mechanic based on RNG between players playing same class... seriously that's just fucking stupid.<br />
<br />
As mythic player im really borried about competitive logs and without the 2 bis leg, its just impossible to reach the highest classment and that makes logs clueless.<br />

Legendaries have always been about dps? Since when? One of the first legendaries ever was Thunderfury, which was great for tanks to help them hold threat on multiple targets. We also have a healing legendary in Wrath. The legendaries in MoP and WoD served damage/survival and healing purposes.

As pointed out numerous times.<br />
<br />
This is fantastic, if you value your primary stat far above your secondaries.<br />
<br />
There are specs that dont. Fire Mages for example, last time I ran a sim for someone they were about 1:1.7 ratio Crit:Int and thats not really uncommon for Rogues either.<br />
<br />
So giving them, for example 1 int per crit, probably isnt going to make them warm and fuzzy.</div></div><hr />

So they will give you a metric ton of int and give DH for example a ton of agi until the loss they get from losing crit is made up by the gain in primary stat. You realize as devs they control all the numbers right? That 1:1.7 ratio is what it is now but they can change it by just a few edits in their game engine..<br />
You will crit less but hit harder and since they can control how much harder you can hit, you will hit harder and harder until you the same DPS as you do now if not slightly higher. Thats what they said is their intent and theres no reason to believe theyre going to lie about it</div></div><hr />

Secondary stats being unintuitive and things like stat weights, caps, breakpoints, and diminishing returns existed before Reforging. And they exist now long after Reforging was excised.<br />
<br />
In a world where stats were intuitive, Reforging would not introduce any new problems.<br />
<br />
However as we don't live in that world, the question is: Does Reforging make existing problems worse? No, it makes them better. It makes it far easier to hit specific stat targets and is a big QOL improvement. It doesn't make the system any more intuitive, but it doesn't make it any less so either.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alanious</div><div class="date">2016-12-09, 01:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Legendaries have always been about dps? Since when? One of the first legendaries ever was Thunderfury, which was great for tanks to help them hold threat on multiple targets. We also have a healing legendary in Wrath. The legendaries in MoP and WoD served damage/survival and healing purposes. So no, legendaries have not always been about damage, nor should it ever be.<br />
<br />
Man I think you don't understand what the few odd ones mean? and if your going to say they were not about dps this conversation is over, your understanding of what &quot;legendarys&quot; mean is totally Bias from what it actually is. Look up facts and understand what i wrote, rather than pointing out literally something i already mentioned. Compare Dps legendary's to Healing and Tanking ones Prior to this expansion and there you go! you answered your own question. On a final note just how is the utility legendary's working now?.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let's see...<br />
Vanilla: Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros (http://www.wowdb.com/items/17182-sulfuras-hand-of-ragnaros) DPS. Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker (http://www.wowdb.com/items/19019-thunderfury-blessed-blade-of-the-windseeker) More or less utility.<br />
BC: Warglaive of Azzinoth (http://www.wowdb.com/items/32837-warglaive-of-azzinoth) DPS, Thori'dal, the Stars' Fury (http://www.wowdb.com/items/34334-thoridal-the-stars-fury) DPS.<br />
Wrath: Val'anyr, Hammer of Ancient Kings (http://www.wowdb.com/items/46017-valanyr-hammer-of-ancient-kings) Healing, Shadowmourne (http://www.wowdb.com/items/49623-shadowmourne) dps.<br />
Cata: Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest (http://www.wowdb.com/items/71086-dragonwrath-tarecgosas-rest) dps.<br />
MoP: 1 dps, 1 tank, 1 healing.<br />
WoD: 1 dps, 1 tank, 1 healing.<br />
Legion: Too many to go through, but very mixed up.<br />
<br />
If we exclude Legion, out of 13 legendaries 7 of them are dps and 6 of them are not, that's hardly &quot;a few odd ones&quot;. If you are going to insist that they indeed are however, or again claim that &quot;legendaries have always been about damage&quot;, then this conversation is indeed over.<br />
<br />
I'm confused about your last question, as it should be rather obvious how they function, somehow I'm guessing you're trying to say that they aren't working all that well? To which I have to disagree, it's the dps legendaries that make people dislike the utility ones. In fact, the damage legendaries make people dislike other damage legendaries, because people only seek the one which provide the strongest numbers, and ignore anything else. Just goes to show why we should not have legendaries that provide damage.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Murderdoll</div><div class="date">2016-12-09, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So they will give you a metric ton of int and give DH for example a ton of agi until the loss they get from losing crit is made up by the gain in primary stat. You realize as devs they control all the numbers right? That 1:1.7 ratio is what it is now but they can change it by just a few edits in their game engine..<br />
You will crit less but hit harder and since they can control how much harder you can hit, you will hit harder and harder until you the same DPS as you do now if not slightly higher. Thats what they said is their intent and theres no reason to believe theyre going to lie about it<br />
<br />
...and then were back in the exact same position where they are giving us far to many stats per ilvl and we repeat the stat squish again because the next tier then has to be far above the current. Do you see the problem? They are literally repeating mistakes they have fixed twice now.<br />
<br />
How would you just give only Demon Hunters and Fire Mages extra stats? Just dump it on their tier? <br />
<br />
What their intent is and what actually happens are vastly different things and they may not set out to lie about it, but very rarely do the two match up.</div></div><hr />

Well that comes down to opinion. FF14 and Guild Wars 2 I would highly recommend. Some F2P ones I could recommend are Wildstar and Skyforge.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is clearly impossible for Blizzard to balance classes and specs with legendaries that can make or break your character's performance. Movement speed equips are a great idea, especially for classes without much mobility, but when they live in the same world as items that increase your dps by an astranomical amount, they become pointless.<br />
<br />
I wish Blizzard would simply change all legendaries to be utility-based, get rid of them, or allow players who have obtained one to a complete semi-lengthy quest to, in essence, exchange it for another one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Definitely not the case for rogues right now. I've run new sims to see my stat weights every upgrade from around around 840 to my current 885. Mastery / Vers / Crit are all around 0.8, the actual values go up or down slightly depending on how much of each you have relative to each other, but they're extremely close. In fact, if you were to stack one of those 3 and ignore the other two, it's value would plummet dramatically.<br />
<br />
Then there's haste. Worthless all around, literally worth half as much or less than the other 3.</div></div><hr />

I honestly dont care what your personal stat weights are. It was an example. If thats not what youve found for your charachter. Fantastic.<br />
<br />
Replace Rogue with Havoc, Fire. Replace it with any of the other specs in the game that value a secondary stat almost if not more than their primary.<br />
<br />
The point stands.</div></div><hr />

Why? The whole point of the high price is for you not to go all crazy and buy 10 at once or shit. Levelling is easy enough anyway.</div></div><hr />
