I think it's pretty clear. You'll be able to level your hunter alt before they release the expansion !  
 
Priests 
It seems that the WotLK client at the Games Convention had the  priest spell changed. 
 
The cooldown has been reduced to 1 minute and you can now cast the spell on a friend up to a 20yards range." />

I don't see how this change helps priest in the least. It might make min maxxing raid guilds like nihilum take 1 disc priest. It won't help priests in PvP that they can now make someone ELSE live, while they themselves die. I suppose its a nice perk, but it doesn't go to the core PvP priest issue of keeping the priest themself up. Can you even spec improved death and pain suppression at the same time?</div></div><hr />

You have no idea. first the cooldown will be 3x shorter. and usualy an arena disc priest is not main healer but off healer. <br />
<br />
As a disc priest in arena, you throw shield on everybody, you renew everybody, you dispell everybody, etc. You roll is to make it a pain to kill your teammate. Having PS castableon others just help this purpose.<br />
<br />
My question is, how long will be the debuff last? Cause it has to be a debuff to prevent a raid to get 7 Disc priest to cast back to back PS on the tank</div></div><hr />

It's a WoLTK change so I don't know if many people will still go at TK, BT.</div></div><hr />
