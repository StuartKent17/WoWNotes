While the Cataclysm updates to many of the professions are still deep in development, we wanted to share some of the work that's been going on, as well as a high-level look at any lessons learned or changes to their underlying philosophies during the design process. Please be aware that not all professions have the same extent of information available right now, but each is receiving the same love and attention as the next.<br />
<br />
Take heed of these teasers as you look forward to your new rank of Illustrious Grand Master!<br />
<br />
Please enjoy!<br />
<br />
General<br />
Perks will continue to exist across all professions, and will upgraded appropriately.<br />
<br />
Blacksmithing, Leatherworking, and Tailoring<br />
Many of the green (and possibly some blue) items made during the process of leveling these professions will contain random stats. In most examples, two stats on these items will be set, and two will be random. The idea with these items is to mix up the skill leveling items so you're not just, for example, creating 10 pairs of boots that are all exactly the same.<br />
Superior-quality items that require more materials than other recipes in the same skill range provide multiple skill-ups. For example, if a recipe takes three times the reagents, it will give you three skill-ups.<br />
We didn't feel like we were getting much flexibility from specializations, so they have been removed for all three of these professions. The intent was to help people diversify their profession to feel different from that of other players, but through other professions we've found systems that work better to this end, such as simply making recipes available that you can earn over time.<br />
To follow up the previous change, all items that required a specialization are now useable by anyone.<br />
Tailoring the high-end Cataclysm items will center around a single cloth type that can be crafted through five different recipes -- each with their own material components and a long cooldown.<br />
All three professions will create their starter sets of PVP gear, which will be upgraded with new recipes every season. In general, these are meant to keep pace as an entry-level PvP set below whatever the current Hero Point set is.<br />
<br />
Alchemy<br />
New elixirs will be about 75% as strong as flasks. So you can get more total stat points with two elixirs, but flasks will still be the best at giving you a single offensive or defensive stat.<br />
New unique material used by nearly all high-level recipes will be created by alchemists on a one-day cooldown.<br />
New Mysterious Potion created with common materials restores health and mana in a massively random range, as well as sometimes granting the benefit of another potion. The health and mana range is from 1-20,000 and is able to crit. The minimum amount restored, however, is scaled upwards by the Alchemy skill, making it a great choice for alchemists to keep for themselves.<br />
All potions and elixirs now use the same basic vial type. Flasks still use a fancy vial.<br />
New Alchemist Stone.<br />
<br />
Enchanting<br />
In general, material component costs for most recipes are more moderate in how much they require, while the highest-end recipes will still require large quantities. The goal of this change is to make the leveling recipes more consistent and not create unintended roadblocks in getting to the higher skill levels.<br />
An enchanter vanity pet is being added.<br />
<br />
New Cataclysm weapon enchantment preview:<br />
Avalanche -- Chance to deal Nature damage on melee hit/spell hit.<br />
Elemental Slayer -- As expected, this enchantment helps players deal devastating damage to elemental creatures.<br />
Hurricane -- A stacking haste proc.<br />
Heartsong -- Mana regeneration through increased Spirit when chain-casting spells.<br />
Many more maximum-level enchantments are still in progress.<br />
<br />
Engineering<br />
Engineering is still being designed, but expect new unpredictable gadgets to use on yourself or enemies. Toys, explosives, and even a new vanity pet or two. Oh, and powerful mechanical bows and crossbows in addition to guns.<br />
In general, we want Engineering to remain a tradeskill mainly focused on creating fun or useful gadgets for the engineer, but we are exploring options for items that can be sold to other players for profit.<br />
<br />
Inscription<br />
With the large number of class changes coming with Cataclysm, many existing glyphs will see new functionality.<br />
Minor glyphs are woefully uneven from one class to the next right now, so they're a focus for us to clean them up and try to ensure that everyone has minor glyphs they're excited about.<br />
New Darkmoon Cards will be added, with hopes they'll all be as awesome as the Greatness card.<br />
We'll be adding more major glyphs as well, but in the hopes of making them as balanced as possible, we'll likely wait until after the expansion ships to add any for the new abilities in Cataclysm.<br />
New and more desirable off-hand and relic recipes will be added.<br />
<br />
Jewelcrafting<br />
Some gem colors have changed! Hit is now blue. Mastery and Dodge are yellow. Intellect is now red. These simple changes have created a much more diverse matrix of gem cuts.<br />
New Jewelcrafting dailies will be introduced.<br />
Many cuts are being added to support the new Mastery stat.<br />
Some new Cataclysm jewelry recipes have completely random properties, and can sometimes create superior and epic versions.<br />
Jewelcrafters will have some fun new (and potentially lucrative) vanity items, including fist weapons, rhinestone sunglasses, monocles, and stardust (sprinkle on players for entertainment).<br />
<br />
Herbalism, Skinning, and Mining<br />
All Cataclysm herbs have the chance of containing Volatile Life.<br />
There won't be a new Lotus equivalent in Cataclysm. Alchemists will use the more reliably-found Volatile Life to create the new high level flasks.<br />
<br />
Herb Example:<br />
&quot;Heartblossom -- Named for its deep red color, this delicate flower grows close to the ground, and always in pairs. If one blossom is taken, the other flower begins to wilt immediately and dies soon after. It is considered very unlucky to disturb a Heartblossom without blessing it first.&quot;<br />
Savage Leather, the basic Cataclysm leather, can be gathered from most creatures found in the expansion areas and can be converted to Heavy Savage Leather at a 6:1 rate.<br />
Pristine Hide, the rare Cataclysm hide, can be found when skinning creatures in the expansion areas, or be converted from Heavy Savage Leather.<br />
Obsidian is the new common mineral found when mining in Cataclysm, and can contain gems, Volatile Fire, and Volatile Shadow.<br />
Elementium is the new uncommon mineral found when mining in Cataclysm, and can contain gems, Volatile Fire, Volatile Water, or Volatile Earth.<br />
Pyrite is the new rare mineral found when mining in Cataclysm, and can contain gems and Volatile Fire.<br />
Previous Elementium Ore and Bar used for classic quests will be renamed to Elementium Ingot and Hardened Elementium Bar.<br />
We like the gathering perks as they are; not a game-changing bonus but something themed and fun. But as all tradeskills are in the design stages these are still being discussed to a degree.<br />
<br />
Cooking<br />
Cooking is still in the early stages, but we plan on continuing with daily quests, feasts, and some fun new recipes.<br />
We liked the cooking dailies that had players picking up items that spawned in the world near the quest giver, so most if not all new cooking dailies will work similarly.<br />
<br />
First Aid<br />
Bandages will have a short cast time and put a heal over time effect on the target for 8 seconds. This effect is broken by damage.<br />
Three new bandages! That's right: THREE!<br />
<br />
Bandage preview:<br />
&quot;Dense Embersilk Bandage&quot; Heals for 34,800 over 8 seconds. Requires 3 Embersilk to create.<br />
<br />
Fishing<br />
Lots of new fish and other fun items to catch! Fish are still used to make premium food.<br />
New fishing dailies.</div></div><hr />

Yes it is, when you need a heal in the middle of dmg to live or you die, but your HoT breaks when you take dmg, and the cast gets pushed back. Thus useless bandage.</div></div><hr />

I remember seeing a pic of a Cata cloak that had 1300 something stamina on it...n that's just the cloak, don't take my word for it, but I bet we'll be seeing tanks with +100k health pool, players will solo The Eye for the phoenix mount no doubt.</div></div><hr />

that means bandages will be more useful because u get a hot after a short cast time probably 1.5 sec cast time and u get a hot for 8 sec.<br />

Sure, they won't save you when you're getting beat on, but they don't do that now.<br />
<br />
2) Alchemy is getting a new, highly desirable &quot;Primal Might&quot; item again while JCing is getting more cool vanity items as well as...fist weapons? Blacksmithing is having some archaic restrictions removed, which is nice, but realistically these restrictions have had zero impact on level 80s and only marginal impact on leveling toons. Blacksmithing would like some love.<br />
<br />
3) More DMC-esque BOEs are good, especially for a crafting profession that isn't a consistent moneymaker like JCing, Enchanting, or Alchemy, but the current DMC is still trading for around 5k on many servers, entirely due to the randomness of crafting the cards. If you just want a decent BOE craftable for fresh 85s, remove or lessen the random aspect, and allow those who are seeking such an item to gather the materials themselves without having to resort to the AH or the Inscription lottery.</div></div><hr />

Really?<br />
Some of us really don't enjoy fishing in the game yet would like to be able to help provide buffs to the guild during raids. Would it really be so bad to make a feast that does NOT require fish that provides the same level of benefit (not less, not close to, the same...)? Make it take twice as many mats, require a &quot;rare&quot; item, a special cooking station. SOMETHING!<br />

<br />
<br />
it would be cool if alchemist got something like this. Alchemy needs something. i just dropped it actually because there is really a lack of benefit, and its something you can have on an alt easy enough.<br />
<br />
the trinkets are nice but you move past them quick enough. the extra time on flasks is efficient but with the price of mats rock bottom now its does no good. flask of the north is a good idea but its too bad there isnt a stamina buff with it. trasmuting gems is really nice, but they are easily bought with the tons of gold and emblems available now hench the price of gems has fallen to sad amounts. after 2 years of having alchemy i just didnt feel enthusiastic enough about it.<br />

That would make fishing tolerable for me. At least tolerable enough to actually make the fish feasts. I know that the pools have a ~100% to drop the fish that the pool has the name of (can still get junk boxes sometimes, though it's rare-ish) but that requires flying around looking for the schools. If I knew I could just fly up to some water and cast and get fish, regardless of skill level, I'd suffer through it.</div></div><hr />

as far as the enchanting pet? hmm.... maybe a small cloud of smoke, or (in lame blizz fashion) a small voidwalker pet like the one you get for reading all the books in dal (Kirin Tor Familiar (http://www.wowhead.com/item=44738))<br />
<br />
<br />
Or maybe Pixies &lt;3 :)<br />

<br />
27.1k hp currently<br />
can't remember for sure what the number was when I dinged 80 but close to 18k<br />
so...18,000/5,800=3.1034<br />
so if the % of healing done remains the same we get:<br />
3.1034*34,800=108,000 when we are about 85 and about 160k at endgame....HOLY SHIT!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dude, what are you smoking? It gives free gem slots. You can't get better stats than that, and because they're gems, you can boost ANY stat you want. That's hella better than most other professions.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
useless? ~35k hp in 8 seconds isnt useless<br />
<br />
it will be when you will be running with 70k-100k hp.. and you will..<br />
<br />
That would be 33% to 50% of your health. That is not small by any stretch. Compare it to 2k you get now with 30k health pools, which is less than a 7% return. But honestly, even if it's only 10%, the fact that you can (if played properly) self heal 10% (or 33% to 50% in your example) health in PVP while moving just rocks.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Dense Embersilk Bandage&quot; Heals for 34,800 over 8 seconds. Requires 3 Embersilk to create.<br />

Damn. 34.800 over 8 seconds when comparing to the current 5.800, makes me feel that Health Points will increase by 6!! That means, a character with 32k life now, will have 192k life??? <br />

However, I would still like them to implement so that bandages have either a chance, or a certainty on being able to remove &quot;Bleeds&quot;. Realistically, and logically that's exactly what they should be able to, and currently only &quot;bubbles&quot; can completely remove bleeds, or the Dwarf racial.<br />
<br />
Even with the change to bandages making them a HoT with a short casttime, if damaged by a Bleed will remove the HoT anyways.<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess I saw somewhere in Blizzcon a Path of the Titans ability that would remove all Bleed Effects from you. So no need for bandages to help rogues more than they will.</div></div><hr />

2) also 35k with some players now having 50-60k (tanks, but still, imagine the cata stamina boost) along with 1) is meh<br />

so unless they come with something useful to use bandages on (dps healing themselves again in raid environment ? kek) we are back to sqare one, just this time it has number three on it ...</div></div><hr />

As someone who likes collecting all avaible recipes, I really HATED that doing the same quests over a hundred times was the ONLY way to get them. No more world or specific drops, just inhumanly boring grinding which you can't even get over with in a single session, you actually have to log in every day and do the quest if you want your recipes. <br />
<br />
No more specialization, less choices to make, less variety, this makes professions even more uninteresting.<br />
<br />
Engineering bows? How does that even work, feels like a silly way to add crafted bows to engineering to make it more &quot;wanted&quot;, should have gone to blacksmithing instead.<br />
<br />
No interesting changes to herbalism and alchemy either, removing the lotus for flasks makes it even more easy to craft them. Flasks seem like an elixir which presists through death rather than an extremly powerful buff for raiding.<br />
<br />
Buffing bandages and adding different ones is a good move, though they should re-introduce other recipes for First Aid like poison antidotes, anti-bleed bandages, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fairly dissapointed with this so far, which is a shame. Hope they spice up the professions the comming months.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can already see a problem. It would be like needing the highest level of raiding drops (orbs, saronite), or spend a fortune to craft each piece beyond the first lvl 85 pvp blue set when it will only be sub par to the highest lvl of pvp gear.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deepone</div><div class="date">2010-05-12, 08:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes it is, when you need a heal in the middle of dmg to live or you die, but your HoT breaks when you take dmg, and the cast gets pushed back. Thus useless bandage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bandages have always been extremely situational, but never useless. If you don't know when to use them, that's another problem.<br />
<br />
Of course, they're useless for a main tank in a raid, but then that's by design to prevent bandages from becoming a sort of &quot;gimp healer&quot; option.<br />
<br />
In Cataclysm with giant health pools and limited healer mana, dpsers are going to need to supplement thier own heals when they can. If they drink healing pots they'll gimp their mana regen, but if they bandage they can immediately go back to dpsing and as long as they don't stand in the fire, the bandage will tick for its full value, costing the dpser only 1 GCD.</div></div><hr />

Of course, they're useless for a main tank in a raid, but then that's by design to prevent bandages from becoming a sort of &quot;gimp healer&quot; option.<br />

In the event that there is always some form of periodic raid damage. I would say it is useless. Get a few ticks off, but still die because you didn't get the full benefit from the bandage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe if you can't do math. Current bandages, 5800 heals. Health of a newb 80 in quest blues, 16-17K. Bangage is 1/3 or less healing. Get any decent gear and it quickly drops to less than a quarter of your health pool (even in ilvl200 gear). Assuming 50K is an accurate number for Cataclysm level 85 health pools, you're looking at a bandage able to heal over 2/3 of your health. I think health pools will be a little larger at 85, so the new bandage will probably heal 50-60% . Very nice compared to current.</div></div><hr />

i'm ticked off here, i have all of the + to fishing skill stuff by this point. WotLK fishing made me not need to use the +100 lures anymore due to its low requirements, then they just go ahead and make fishing in northrend pools be available with a 0% failure rate to anyone to train a skill level of 1 and buy a 1 copper fishing pole in dalaran. ::)<br />

<br />
Yay for me! and people said sticking with enchanting wouldn't pay off..............but I get a vanity pet! 8) /sarcasm<br />
<br />
About fishing: Honestly I think they ran out of ideas to add to the profession. More things to catch=more time spent actually trying to catch fish needed for recipes, and it would suck if they just added more 1c junk items. If they added more items to the boxes that can be fished, like rare crafting recipes, that would be neat. Please not more deviate fish. Sounds like my Blacksmithing and Tailoring are getting very interesting. I love the idea of more skillups with rare items, so anti-climatic to gather materials for weeks, and make that awesome item only to gain all of one skill increase.<br />
<br />
Cooking: More fighting over people for mustard/mushroom spawns for a daily quest that uses many more materials than it rewards. Chilled meat wasn't the easiest darn thing to find.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We didn't feel like we were getting much flexibility from specializations, so they have been removed for all three of these professions. The intent was to help people diversify their profession to feel different from that of other players, but through other professions we've found systems that work better to this end, such as simply making recipes available that you can earn over time.<br />
This and the fact that the other professions are retaining daily quests implies that Blacksmithing et al might be getting their own set of daily quests. With a larger set of recipes, but a limited rate of acquisition, players will initially be specialized based on which recipes they first purchase; someone might decide to purchase all the axe plans first while another might prefer the armor pieces. In the long term people would be able to acquire all the patterns, but by then the patterns would be eclipsed by the higher tier raid/pvp gear and only collectors/completionists would be collecting all the patterns. Blizzard could also introduce weekly raid-profession quests, where you save up higher level tokens for the raid patterns.<br />
<br />
Re: Bandages.<br />
I think the reasons that they are introducing THREE new bandages is that the bandageHP:playerHP ratio is no longer attractable at current gear levels. Assuming that there would still be one- and two-cloth embersilk bandages, then the 3-cloth dense embersilk bandages are probably the best bandage available. Also, bandages do not and should not fully heal someone. Since they are no longer channeled they'll be more attractive by dps classes to use as there is less dps downtime.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Enchanting<br />
<br />
An enchanter vanity pet is being added.<br />
<br />
<br />
Aside from all the cool new high-end enchants, I am interested to see just what sort of wee pet an enchanter can make! I'm not a huge pet collector, but one more will be nice for my main, who is an enchanter.<br />
<br />
Engineering<br />
<br />
Oh, and powerful mechanical bows and crossbows in addition to guns.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's about time they introduced more than simply guns for engineers. My shaman will have fun with new toys and I'll be able to make a new crossbow for my hunter!<br />
<br />
Inscription<br />
<br />
New and more desirable off-hand and relic recipes will be added.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cool. We really do need to be able to make off-hands and I just hope that they will be BoE. As for relics, my DK is my scribe, so hopefully there will be an excellent BoP sigil!<br />
<br />
Jewelcrafting<br />
<br />
Jewelcrafters will have some fun new (and potentially lucrative) vanity items, including fist weapons, rhinestone sunglasses, monocles, and stardust (sprinkle on players for entertainment).<br />
<br />
<br />
I am so wearing a monocle. :o And fancy being able to make fist weapons. Almost makes me want to respec my shaman to enhancement. XD<br />
<br />
I am also excited about the new names for things (Embersilk, Savage Leather, Volatile elements, Pyrite Ore -- most of which we already knew), although it is quite unoriginal for them to recycle the name Elementium, so that's a tad disappointing. They could have gone with Palladium or something. ;)</div></div><hr />

Love the items that I've gotten out of the fishing bag. Still waiting for a nice fishing rod for my priest, though. Sounds like cooking and fishing will be nice to do again in Cata. I'm currently at 320 on my third character for fishing. The others are at 450. Love to fish. :D <br />
<br />
And for the person saying it could be hard to find Chilled Meat? Never worry about it again. Go farm Hardknuckles in Sholazar for about a half hour, and you'll have Chilled Meat set for several dailies. Once a week is probably more than enough. Rhino Meat a plenty on the plains next to the Engine of the Makers in Storm Peaks for that cooking daily. For the record, Wowhead has the Chilled Meat dropping at 60% off of Hardknuckle Chargers, and 61% off of Hardknuckle Foragers. Enjoy! :D</div></div><hr />

Many of the green (and possibly some blue) items made during the process of leveling these professions will contain random stats. In most examples, two stats on these items will be set, and two will be random. The idea with these items is to mix up the skill leveling items so you're not just, for example, creating 10 pairs of boots that are all exactly the same.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deadman80</div><div class="date">2010-05-13, 09:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tailoring - <br />
Old way (w/ specs): 2/1/1 of 3 different cloth types possible every 4 days (total of 4, at least 1 of which would be useless for any specific recipe)<br />
New way (w/o specs): 5 of a single cloth type possible every 4 days (total of 5, none of which are excluded based on recipe)<br />
Verdict: .. No matter how I look at it, the new system sounds better. Still wish they would lower the bloody cooldown on these tho -_-;; Always felt kinda unfair that tailors always have longer CDs than the other profs.<br />
<br />
First Aid -<br />
Pre-Cata: Right now, My hunter has ~24k hp unbuffed in raid gear, ~30k hp unbuffed in solo/pvp gear... Highest level bandage heals 5.8k (so ~20%-25%, lower percentage with buffs)<br />
Post-Cata: Highest level bandage heals 34.8k ... o_O;; I rather doubt that dps classes will have 140k-175k hp unbuffed because of what that would do to old content Does Blizz reeeeally want to see ICC10 trio'd less than a year after it was released? I don't think that 100k hp in full raid level gear would be out of the question for us though, and that would mean that this would heal for ~33% of total hp, which sounds significant enough to at least think about using before bitching at the healer to top you off between pulls when he is already drinking XD (I don't do this, I actually use pots/bandages a LOT to take the load off the healers in groups, but I've seen it happen a lot -_-;;)<br />
Verdict: 100% pure buffage :3 No nerfs allowed here XD I like this.<br />
<br />
Leatherworking - <br />
Pre-Cata: Possible skinning results: scraps, leather, fur... Scraps turn into leather, base leather upgraded to heavy at 6:1 ratio, fur is annoying RNG very low droprate and required for everything worth making for someone to use.<br />
Post-Cata: Possible skinning results: leather, hide... Leather upgrades to heavy at 6:1 ratio, hide is probably annoying RNG (but likely to have higher drop rate than fur), CAN UPGRADE HEAVY LEATHER TO HIDE!!! Thank you Blizz for giving farmers with bad RNG a way to overcome randomness with perseverance!! ^_^ Please no more than 3:1 though, it will be irritating to use more than a full stack of leather to get a single piece of material instead of an actual end-result product.<br />
<br />
Random stats on green/blue armor -<br />
First off, there will be FOUR stats on each of the &quot;junk&quot; greens we make for skillups. 2 predetermined, 2 random. I have a feeling they will still be limited by Blizzard's statement to remove mostly useless stat combos like STR/SPI, so they won't be totally useless. I am interested in whether they will all have the same restrictions and exactly which stats will be locked and which can be random. (Either way, most of my greens will get DE'd so not a big deal for me ^^;;)<br />
<br />
Fishing - <br />
Q_Q No word on how this is getting updated. I think as a 2ndary gathering prof it should have a perk like the other gathering profs... Something simple, easy to understand, useful to all 10 classes and that doesn't break the game should be simple enough to add. Maybe increased health regen when out of combat (or when drunk XD Makes those &quot;Captain Rumsey's Lager&quot; even better for the devoted fisherman.) <br />
Blizz likes tradeskill dailies, so give us a non-random way to get upgrades like cooking in wotlk. It could add a lot of flavor to be able to use daily tokens to buy new rods, lines, armor, and vanity items AND it wouldn't break the game unless they were stupid about the dps on the poles or something lol. Add in static buffs purchasable with gold like CWF that do things like &quot;Multi-hook Lure: Doubles your catch when you fish.&quot; or &quot;Sure-catch Hook: Reduces maximum fishing cast time to 6 seconds.&quot; I would happily pay 1k gold for each of those.<br />
Add a few fishing related recipes to the other profs... BS making poles makes sense; LW/Tailor making waders, hats, etc makes sense; Maybe JC can make reusable lures and engi can make &quot;Fish Finder: When used, increases the chance to catch a fish versus an old boot (Lowers trash catch rate, 3-5min duration, matching CD)&quot;<br />
There is a ton of room to add to fishing and little has been done since BC other than make it simpler to skillup.</div></div><hr />

Some of us really don't enjoy fishing in the game yet would like to be able to help provide buffs to the guild during raids. Would it really be so bad to make a feast that does NOT require fish that provides the same level of benefit (not less, not close to, the same...)? Make it take twice as many mats, require a &quot;rare&quot; item, a special cooking station. SOMETHING!<br />
<br />
Either that or overhaul the outrageously boring fishing system. I recall something being mentioned about this many many months ago, but nothing has been said since. /sigh....<br />
<br />
<br />
If feats and fish feasts provided the same stats than there would be no reason to level fishing. <br />
<br />
They already changed fishing so you don't need to level it anymore (you can catch recipe fish in fishing pools with a skill level of 1). The only reason to have high skill level in fishing is to fish in open waters - which have a lower chance of catching fish required for the fish feast recipe.</div></div><hr />

Well, Blizzard said several times healthpools are going to be much, much more inflated in Cata. The reason was for healing, and the other I believe for PvP. So though that number sounds insane right now for us, in Cata it may well be that it heals for the same % of health, hopefully a bit more, as bandages heal today.<br />
<br />
I don't think we're going back to that Vanilla concept someone mentioned, although I agree that would be an interesting change. We'll have to see. Maybe they're just trying to make bandages a bit less tedious to use (not sure how a channel can be tedious, but then again, I think old hunters can argue quite a bit on that).</div></div><hr />

Different is not better or worse. Blacksmiths can get Titansteel bars faster (miner's make them on a 1 per day CD), *but* Titansteel is made from three Titanium Bars and three different eternals. The mats are rare and expensive. By contrast you can only make cloth every 4 days (though you can actually make four cloths at once, so in a way it works out), but the mats are a joke. Two eternals (the same two, easily farmable), and a bunch of easy to collect cloth that you'll get just doing your normal thing. On top of that the tailor makes the cloth with his own CD, the Blacksmith needs to be or find a miner (at end game it's not uncommon for people's mains to have two crafting professions for the bonuses).<br />
<br />
Are there advantages to the quicker CD on Titansteel and the lower mat requirement? Sure. Do Tailors have other advantages to compensate? Yes. And before you say anything, I have a tailor, but no blacksmith, so if I was biased at all it ought to be toward tailors. I have so much damn cloth in my Tailor's that i regularly have to bleed it off to the Auction House to make room.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Orinosuke</div><div class="date">2010-05-13, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Health pools are definitely going up in Cataclysm, I recall Blizz saying that they'll likely increase by 200-300%. However, I don't think we're comparing the right bandages in making estimates on the potency of this 34k bandage. It seems to me that this new, &quot;3rd tier&quot; bandage will likely be stronger than the new Cat Heavy Bandage, and thus have a higher average % of healing.<br />
<br />
If we look at the Heavy Frostweave, healing 5800 over 8 seconds, and the average health pool of a fresh 80 (let's say 17k, non-tank,) that's around 1/3 of your health filled from a bandage. Let's triple that number (in line with Blizz's estimates, being generous) and say the average 85's starting health is 51k, or even 60k, to be fair (again, non-tank.) That means that this new, &quot;Super&quot; bandage would be healing at least 50% of your health pool. That's a reasonable strength. <br />
<br />
We'll probably see the new Heavy Bandage healing somewhere closer to 18-20k health.</div></div><hr />

I like how Blizzard has reduced the number of mandatory raid consumables (especially ones that get popped on a per-fight basis) recently. This looks like a move in the other direction. It seems that in many cases (depending on class/spec) 2 elixirs will be better than a flask. This means that for progression content, we're back to popping 2 relatively expensive consumables per person per fight. Not the end of the world by any means, just a step back (IMO).<br />
<br />
Rest of it looks pretty nice.</div></div><hr />
