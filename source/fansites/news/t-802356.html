New Battleground Brackets<br />
The uneasy armistice between the Horde and Alliance is steadily cracking beneath the strain of Deathwing's devastating return and the Shattering of Azeroth, heralding a new era of bloody conflict.<br />
<br />
The clash between the factions has also never been so hotly contested: Battleground brackets now match up teams more evenly. The new brackets span five levels each, except the final bracket composed of level 85 players:<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;style&gt;table tr td { padding:5px;}&lt;/style&gt;<br />
&lt;table&gt;<br />
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;10-14&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;30-34&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;50-54&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;70-74&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;<br />
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;15-19&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;35-39&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;55-59&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;75-79&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;<br />
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;20-24&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;40-44&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;60-64&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;80-84&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;<br />
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;25-29&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;45-49&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;65-69&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;85&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;<br />
&lt;/table&gt;<br />
<br />
Fighters can also join the battle in Arathi Basin, Eye of the Storm, and Alterac Valley at an earlier level than ever before:<br />
<br />
Level 10 - Arathi Basin and Warsong Gulch<br />
<br />
Level 35 - Eye of the Storm<br />
<br />
Level 45 - Alterac Valley<br />
<br />
Level 65 - Strand of the Ancients<br />
<br />
Level 75 - Isle of Conquest<br />
<br />
Level 85 - Battle for Gilneas and Twin Peaks<br />
<br />
These changes should offer players a more consistently competitive experience in the Battlegrounds as their characters level, as well as provide for more exciting PvP conflict than ever before. Are you eager to try 35-39 Eye of the Storm? How about 45-49 Alterac Valley? Perhaps you'd like to cut your teeth on a 10-14 Arathi Basin.<br />

Tanking With a Vengeance<br />
A very nice paladin player asked me recently about Vengeance. She had concerns about the mechanic, which made me realize that we haven’t done the best job of explaining to players exactly what Vengeance is supposed to accomplish.<br />
<br />
Vengeance is a new passive ability gained by choosing one of the tanking talent trees: Protection for warriors and paladins, Blood for death knights, or Feral for druids. When a tank with one of these talent specs takes damage, she gains an attack power bonus based on the damage taken. This bonus can’t exceed 10% of her health.<br />
<br />
Vengeance was designed for a single purpose, which is to make sure tank threat scales as other players improve their gear. Imagine a raid of reasonably geared level-85 characters. In the absence of Vengeance, the tank might generate about 50% of the damage of a DPS character. With the tank’s threat modifiers this should be sufficient for her to generate enough threat to keep her targets stuck to her (unless something unusual is going on in the encounter). The problem is that in later tiers the mages and rogues in the raid accumulate gear that continues to increase their damage, while the tank chooses gear that increases her survivability. Tanks will pick up some threat stats along the way, but as their survival is almost always a necessary condition for victory, they choose gear accordingly. In later tiers, instead of doing 50% of the damage of a DPS class, the tank might start to slip to 30% or less of a DPS character's damage. Now threat becomes an issue. Threat needs to be an important part of the game -- I’ll try to explain why we think so in a future blog. However, it isn’t our design intent for threat generation to get much harder in the third tier of content relative to the first.<br />
<br />
So that’s what Vengeance is supposed to be. Here is what it’s not supposed to be. Vengeance is not supposed to solve the threat problem completely. A tank shouldn’t be able to just auto-attack and let Vengeance do the rest. Vengeance isn’t a replacement for the tank generating enough initial threat to get the targets to stick to her. She shouldn’t need to rely on Vengeance in the first six seconds of combat. It’s there to prevent the warlock from slowly creeping up on her threat in the middle of the fight. (If this has never happened to your raid, it’s possible that the huge threat transfer potential of the rogue Tricks of the Trade and hunter Misdirection masked how dicey threat really was for you, but those abilities were redesigned for Cataclysm.) In fact, you shouldn’t need Vengeance at all in the first couple of tiers of Cataclysm content. If a lucky dodge streak causes Vengeance to fall off, and that means that you can’t generate enough threat, then either our numbers aren’t tuned correctly, or you need to L2tank.<br />
<br />
Vengeance also isn’t supposed to make you scared to attack a tank in PvP. Tanks have enough benefits in PvP, such as being hard to kill and control, especially in Cataclysm when Rated Battlegrounds provide them with a role where they can defend flags or towers. Players generally don’t hit hard enough to trigger the full effect of Vengeance, unless they are all ganging up on one tank, at which point someone in the group should have the ability to dispel it (Vengeance is treated as an Enrage effect for dispel purposes).<br />
<br />
Vengeance is a new mechanic, and like many design changes, it may take some tweaking to get right. Maybe it takes too long to stack up or falls off too easily. Maybe it does too much of the tank’s job for her and ends up producing a generation of lazy tanks. Threat is a tricky thing to balance. If it’s too easy to maintain, then the tank isn’t having fun. If it’s too hard to maintain, then nobody is having fun.<br />
<br />
Believe it or not, we want tanking to be fun.<br />

<br />
With the imbalance of Alliance populations over horde and much broader battlegroups, horde queues will be a lot shorter than alliance. Might still be long with the bg level ranges split, but might be more people are willing to do it when they aren't getting punted by the larger ability/equipment gaps that existed before.<br />

Typically inane and politically correct GC post filled with strawmanning and specious logic<br />
<br />
I wasn't aware my Vengeance buff in any way scaled with anyone's gear but my own<br />
<br />
To some extent it will scale with the tier of content you are on, because the mobs will be hitting harder and more often in later tiers as a way to task the healers' gear-improved abilities. Its still affected by your max hp of course, but thats the cap of the buff. Lower tier mobs that no longer hit you as hard or often, may not buff your AP fully. <br />
<br />
Mob damage has to be scaled to give you max AP contribution even with your higher stam and avoidance. That AP boost needs to bring you within a reasonable threat range of similarly geared dpsers and the incoming damage causing it needs to be reasonably healable by similarly geared healers.<br />
<br />
Bottomline, its more than just your gear that will matter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
in what way is it fun now spec as a warrior tank when u have paly/dk tanks in the guild that throw out an extream high dps. its abit fecked when a dk/paly tank almost out dps my fury warr in a hc, and my warr aint crap geared and i do know how to play fury.<br />
and its extreamly hard to keep up on threat when tanking as warr with a dk/paly tank in a raid, had a guildy that gets close to 100k hits with his abilites im not even close on my warr, my tank gear isnt crap either and think my highest hit is like 25k(maybe close to 30) and its very rare i see those numbers.<br />
<br />
can only hope it gets more balanced in cata cause atm warriors bin butt f****d abit to much for my taste, even in the lastest update the palys got buffed since they now can hit mobs behind them without even turning around, like conc wasnt enough.....<br />

It was an example. He picked two random DPSers and used those.

Like if you put a paladin and a druid, there's still only &quot;maybe&quot; on AP% (and somehow it's green for mana part of the buff). <br />
Or 3% damage buff from BM hunter only &quot;maybe&quot;, even thought it's only 1 point talant and linked to dps increase talant, so even those who would like to skip double buff would likely take that point. <br />
Also setting any class into frame will show stamina and stats buffs as possible - is that supposed to be runescrolls and drums? If so, better to show that somehow in buff list.</div></div><hr />

(5% spell crit debuff). Currently showing Destro only. Someone above mentioned that Affliction should have it, and I think Demo should be on that list as well. Currently all 3 specs are likely to take it, and all three can provide it with a (relatively) minimal penalty to themselves at worst.<br />
<br />
As for the split BGs: The bulk of the people who queued prior to this did it in the upper half of the bracket, in my experience. Upper-half queues shouldn't be significantly affected by this. Lower-half queues should be just fine as well, since now when you hit any x0, there's no reason not to queue. I, for one, will take this opportunity to queue at any arbitrary time as I level, because it will no longer mean being -6 to -9.<br />
<br />
For those of you griping about GC's post being carefully worded: It isn't something he wrote for you. If you know the hows and whys of vengeance from the dozens of posts on the subject during the Beta, then you're not the target audience. He wrote it for the larger population, where many don't understand the point. And for the record, GC:&quot;which is to make sure tank threat scales as other players improve their gear&quot; does not mean &quot;scales with other players' gear&quot;. Interpreting it that way is frankly ridiculous. What it means is that as we progress in tiers, your raid will in general gear up. Tank threat needs to scale as that happens. Vengeance helps it do so. Simple.</div></div><hr />

Jesus what an idiot, so now we're suppose to be able to &quot;play&quot; RNG? Pretty fucking tired of RNG in every single fucking aspect of this game.<br />
Meh this expac and the just plain stupid xp curve while leveling ( quest mobs going grey before finishing a zone, with no heirlooms and just quest gear. WTF), the constant quest text insulting the player base (constantly breaking immersion), the childish inclusion of swearing that does absolutely nothing to the storyline. <br />
This really really really was not the work of good mmo developers this was the work of mediocre console developers trying to impress 12 year olds while making their jobs easier in the future and passing it off as a bonus for the player.

<br />
I agree with you completely. I'm sitting here looking at my dodge rating going wait a minute you mean I'm bad for avoiding damage now? And people want to question why tanks are stacking stam. Well obviously because if we avoid damage we are bad. <br />
<br />
See this is why I think you need to have someone that actually tanks balance tanks. Having a dps balance tanks is a stupid idea, same with heals. I do two things, I heal and I tank. It isn't that I don't like to dps, I just prefer those two. I like knowing that if we win or fail it's on me at least partly. I can handle that responsibility.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Mob damage has to be scaled to give you max AP contribution even with your higher stam and avoidance. That AP boost needs to bring you within a reasonable threat range of similarly geared dpsers and the incoming damage causing it needs to be reasonably healable by similarly geared healers.<br />
<br />
Bottomline, its more than just your gear that will matter. <br />
<br />
The answer is pretty damn simple really. Give tanks as part of their anti crit talent one that says you get X of your stam as attack power. Stam is something that is always going to be huge on tank gear, but it will never match the 2 to 1 dps get from strength. So there is no reason they would worry about dps going tank spec for more damage. Right now I'm sitting at 4k stam, veng can give me a total of 5k attack power. So if they just converted it to Vengeance makes it so a tank gets 1 ap for every stam they have it wouldn't be even but it would be close without having to worry about the falling off or ramp up mechanic. Plus most tanks that I know of (myself included) only have issues with threat the start of a fight, not halfway through. At halfway through a fight I have a HUGE lead in threat. It's the beginning that really causes issues. It only takes a second of lost agro to lose someone in a fight.</div></div><hr />

2 Plate tank<br />

<br />
In fights with tank swapping, when you offtank your stacks drop off and your threat is gimped<br />
The ramp up can be long and unpredictable, plus breaks in damage from phases or avoidance mess up the stacking<br />
Threat being scaled around a buff that is unpredictable is less than ideal<br />
<br />
In regards to gear level and vengeance, it is likely to stack quicker with worse gear but the cap will be at a lower level due to less total stamina.</div></div><hr />

Over at Petopia, I've been maintaining a large and accurate spreadsheet full of this raid buff/debuff/ability information while eagerly awaiting MMO Raid Comp's update. The project began as a way to monitor hunter pets' abilities but quickly grew into a very large-scale list of every single player-to-player ability in the game (including buffs, debuffs, dispels, resurrections, and every single &quot;crowd control&quot; in the game).<br />
<br />
The list includes relevant item and spell IDs for all abilities, talents, glyphs and poisons; spell information such as duration and cooldown; and a very thorough categorization (along with an explanation) of all the crowd control abilities.<br />
<br />
If you haven't seen it already, please feel free to look at and browse my comprehensive spreadsheets on GoogleDocs here: Malazee's Hunter Pet Spreadsheets (https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0Aox2ZHZE6e_SdHhTc0tZam05QVJDU0lONnp0ZVgzdkE&amp;hl=en). (The fourth and fifth sheets are the ones I expect you to find most useful.) I'm extremely confident in the accuracy of my spreadsheets because they have been poured over by many different eyes and are the product of months of investigation. I hope that my sheets are able to help you double-check your own work and fix any mistakes you may have made.<br />
<br />
I have also been working very closely with a colleague of mine (Anyia, she did all the hard work in coding really) to develop an addon which enables this information to be viewed in-game. It's not as interactive as the MMO Raid Comp tool, but I think you'll find that it fulfills the same purpose: determining which buffs/debuffs are currently being covered by your raid group, and then determining what classes could fill those holes. The mod is called RaidChecklist (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/raid_checklist.aspx), and it is completely functional and Cataclysm-ready.<br />
<br />
Please check out both the Spreadsheets I have made and the addon that Anyia developed. If you find them useful, then please help us to spread the word about their availability. :)<br />
<br />
And, of course, thank you for the update on the MMO Raid Comp tool. It was the inspiration for all the work I did on my spreadsheets.</div></div><hr />

I think you are all reading it wrong. He doesn't mean you are bad when you dodge, he means you are bad if dodging makes you lose threat immediately. A good tank should have enough aggro to handle a lucky streak of dodges. So when you can't handle that, either the numbers on things like vengeance are off, or you are a bad tank for not building enough aggro before, to handle the lucky streak.<br />
<br />
That sound perfectly reasonable to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yet that isn't what the idiot said. He clearly doesn't tank, and has no concept of where tanking is right now. It's very easy for someone who doesn't tank, or doesn't tank on a regular basis, to make claims like that. The fact is though that tanking is hard. You are having to keep up with a great many things at once. Not only your cds, but your healers cds , boss cds, any mechanics of the raid, and threat. <br />
<br />
I will give an example. Let's say you are fighting a boss like marrowgar. Simply because he is easier. There are times when you aren't getting hit by him. Yet when he goes back to the phase where you need to tank him dps are fully capable of unloading right away. As a tank though you have to build up your vengeance. It gets worse though because as an off tank you can't build it. So when you do taunt off the mt you have to lead it build on you again, meanwhile the mt has now had his fall off. It shouldn't be like that. I don't really need something else to keep track of, not to mention it encourages me to actively take damage instead of trying to avoid it. It's really counter to what I feel I should be doing as a tank. That is keeping him locked on me while taking as little damage as possible. Not hoping like hell he hits me good and hard so I can build up vengeance to keep up with the raid. Now you might not think 5k attack power adds much to my ability to tank. I will tell you that it does, it adds a huge ability to it. Without that extra attack power it's going to be much easier for someone to pull off me. Maybe not now because so few bosses wipe threat, but if they do in cata then it's going to present some real issues.</div></div><hr />
