<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeina</div><div class="date">2010-03-25, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Assuming Blizzard sticks to their guns about the ICC Buff. The last buff to 30% will hit in the beginning of August, which will most likely coincide with the release of the pre-expansion patch, be it 3.9 or 4.0, a la the 3.0 nerf. This places Cataclysm release around the first of September. Blizzard can live up to their claim of &quot;everyone complaining about Goblin rogues by next Blizzcon&quot;<br />
<br />
They'll probably be talking about 4.1 alot.. and a little of 4.2... Starcraft 2 expansion is a possibility, but probably a bit too soon after launch to go into it. Lots of Diablo 3 info. And the possibility of the new MMO.<br />
<br />
There is no way they'll release information about the next WoW Expansion.</div></div><hr />

And yet we see &quot;illegal pics/vids&quot; of blizzcon on the net every year. Wonder how they keep it out this time :o</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowyld</div><div class="date">2010-03-25, 06:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BlizzCon being in October is most likely to give Cataclysm time to release before the event (as alluded to during the last BlizzCon). I had originally hoped for a late Spring/early Summer release for Cataclysm, the lack of any Beta or sign of an impending Beta is making that prediction seem more and more unlikely. I am thinking, now, that it will be an August or September release, giving Blizzard plenty of time to work out major release bugs before lauding their successful new product at the convention. This would mean that a Beta could be as early as next month or May. Only time will tell, though.</div></div><hr />

If anyone ever had to do a study of &quot;What happens when a bunch of poor hygiene, no life, fat nerds gather together&quot;, this would be the place to do it. Its insane that they actually charge money for Blizzcon tickets. <br />

I really can't wait for Final Fantasy XIV to come out, so this game and all the annoying things about it can finally die off. <br />

<br />
I gotta, ask. If you hate WoW so much, why the hell do you have an account on a forum that is all about WoW?<br />
<br />
On topic, it feels like last years Blizzcon just happened last week, this is pretty early imo.</div></div><hr />

Blizz has given hints to a release before the next Blizzcon, along with repeatedly stating that they want to not have a huge gap in content again.<br />

I'm not dead set on this idea. Been around Blizz too long to not be fully aware that their release dates tend to be fluid. ;D</div></div><hr />

i mean cmon, its already going to be April before a world first LK 25 HM kill, there is still a new raid coming in 3.3.5, and the cata prepatch 3.9 (which is usually released about a month before expansion release).</div></div><hr />

No offense, but the only reason it still continues to have any kind of fan base is because its a Final Fantasy game. Even if a game like WoW died out, there would still be enough hardcore Warcraft fans to keep it going for years.</div></div><hr />

Costumes may not include or otherwise utilize any edged weapons (such as knives, daggers, and swords); actual clubs, maces, or other crushing weapons; or projectile weapons of any kind, even if unloaded or nonfunctional (this includes firearms of any kind including air guns, longbows, crossbows, etc.). Acceptable costume weapon props are limited to air-filled or soft plastic melee weapons (swords, daggers, maces, clubs, etc.) and wooden staves that are not shod with metal. <br />

I don't know why, but something about this section made me laugh histerically :P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ent0mbed</div><div class="date">2010-03-26, 12:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzcon does not always mean BIG announcements! Trust me... I was and the 2nd and the 3rd Blizzcons. The 2nd one was the awesome announcement of Burning Crusade. The 3rd one was... squat. The biggest thing they announced was the new class for Diablo 3. That's it. They even stated that they aren't having Blizzcon solely as a way to announce products but as a celebration of their fans.<br />
<br />
Why would they move Blizzcon outside of Anaheim? It's where they're at and it sells out so fast they can't even keep their website online. They have no incentive to move it. Plus I'd take California over New York for a vacation every time.<br />
<br />
Not sure about the Cataclysm release date (obviously), but if I were to wager on it I would pick mid-late September. Why? No idea. It just seems right to me... no other reason.<br />
<br />
Things I wouldn't be surprised to hear about at Blizzcon:<br />
- Starcraft expansion (someone else said it first... it sounds very reasonable).<br />
- New Diablo 3 class (playable at the convention) - I bet this game won't be out until 2012.<br />
- Talk about the new WoW TCG releases and company doing them.<br />
- The first major content patch for Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Remember, Blizzcon isn't the place they release everything for the first time. The WotLK cinematic was released at the Games Convention 2008... not Blizzcon.<br />
<br />
Fun convention in my opinion. I had lots of fun both times that I went. Doubt I'll make it this time though... not a cheap trip.</div></div><hr />

To the people that haven't read the Stormrage book (or at least spoiled it by Wiki'ing), there most likely wont be an Emerald Nightmare expansion, if there is we wont see it for a long time. The book (hopefully this doesn't spoil anything) pretty much concludes the &quot;current&quot; issues in the Emerald Dream for there to be a reason for an expansion, let alone requiring players to go there, and makes everything happy again.</div></div><hr />

From Loregy.com:<br />
<br />
Did Tom Chilton make a slip of the tongue and give us additional insight as to when Blizzard’s target release date lies for WoW: Cataclysm? We think he did.<br />
<br />
Read on… At this point, Mike Morhaime, President of Blizzard, has already confirmed that the target release date is set for 2010 (as we figured).<br />
<br />
However, during the first seminar, which was a discussion of Cataclysm, Tom Chilton mentioned something else. While discussing the new Goblin race, Chilton voiced an afterthought (to paraphrase), “I’m sure Alliance will be complaining about Goblin rogues at the next BlizzCon.”</div></div><hr />

yeah i kinda agree, its April and theres no talk about Beta yet. last year BlizzCon was in August and now they moved it to October, thats a 2 month diff and i think it was made like this cuz they will finish with Beta testing and announce the official date on BlizzCon.<br />
<br />
After Beta they need 1-2 months to polish all changes, send to production, send around the world and be ready before BlizzCon - very low chance it will happend...<br />

Six months on Lich King beta? Exaggeration is an artform you don't yet phantom, young grass-hoppa. Beta was a solid three months at best.</div></div><hr />

sorry but your wrong, a good few sites have stated about 6 months each of the beta periods. Not all of the period is open so it might look shorter</div></div><hr />

We all know how close blizzard plays things to the chest. how can we know for sure they don't have a private beta-like testing going on right now? A big enough company with enough money can do very large scale testing without anyone even noticing. That's not to say there won't be a beta (dur), but maybe it doesn't have to be the full '6 months', as you say.<br />
<br />
There's a LOT of work they're putting into cataclysm, and one of their biggest changes is simplifying a lot of mechanics, possibly making there less to test on a live scale. On that same note, a game build on such large foundations such as wow has fuctioned almost the same way for all these years, and therefore, one can assume that blizzard maybe is getting a hang of it...<br />
<br />
All i'm basing this on is that 90% of every set of patch notes seems to be character tweeks, so thats what they spend a shit ton of their time fixing after the release date.<br />
<br />
Lastly, it would seem really stupid for blizzard to wait as they already have, and then another 4-5 months (or even longer) with people only having ICC... that ruby sanctum raid seems like its barely any more interesting than OS... don't think that'll last long, especially since it isn't another tier up, its the same tier as icc. one short instance in the same tier of content won't hold people for long. And lik many here have said/experienced, the pre-cata event should only be a month or so....<br />
<br />
I'm basing this of nothing but my own basic logic, lack of experience, and incredibly high eagerness to play cataclysm. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
August 3, 2007: WotLK expansion announced at Blizzcon<br />
April 10, 2008: WotLK Alpha start date<br />
July 18, 2008: WotLK Beta start date<br />
November 13, 2008: WotLK released in stores<br />
August 21, 2009: Cataclysm expansion announced at Blizzcon<br />
April ??, 2010: Cataclysm alpha start date???<br />
<br />
Of course, these dates mean absolutely nothing in regard to when Cataclysm will be released, but at least we don't have to debate how long the last beta lasted anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That having been said, I'm willing to bet that it will either be released just before Blizzcon or just after Blizzcon given that Blizzcon was moved to October. Then again, that could've been because of the Las Vegas leak thing, but I doubt it.</div></div><hr />

That is not to say that Alpha hasn't began, I think may have even began before January. We don't know for certain, though.</div></div><hr />

I don't know what proof the guy after me has, but here is a link to a news article on wow.com releasing the info that the alpha started on the date I gave:<br />

<br />
Edit: Ok, I think there may be some misunderstanding. I thought Fuzz was referring to the *Cataclysm* Alpha, but I see he did not actually put the title in his post.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ent0mbed</div><div class="date">2010-03-26, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I see what you're talking about. I may have misunderstood what he is saying as well. In regard to the alpha starting in January (or having started at all) I personally doubt it because it seems that nothing major is done by Blizzard anymore without the entire story being leaked on websites. We found out every single major feature being announced at Blizzcon 2009 weeks before the convention. I doubt something as big as an alpha would remain silent for over two months.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowyld</div><div class="date">2010-03-26, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know, the expansion has been in development for a long time now. I would find it more unlikely that it *hasn't* entered Alpha yet. As far as leaks go, I honestly do not believe they are as accidental as they seem. Blizzard managed to keep the Draenei locked up until the day of the E3 where they were announced. I think Blizzard chooses what information &quot;slips out&quot;. With the primary Cataclysm leak, it was to hype BlizzCon. I think they are keeping the Alpha testing secret this time around, so they can surprise us with a &quot;sooner than you think&quot; release of the Beta. We'll see, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For your airfare + convention ticket, you get:<br />
1. Long lines to register<br />
2. Longer lines to get in on Fri and Sat morning<br />
3. Packed exhibit halls, with people saving whole rows of seats by strewing bags and lanyards across chairs<br />
4. Soda machines that are almost constantly Sold Out of anything but Diet Sprite<br />
5. Overpriced food vendors<br />
6. Your hotel bill<br />
7. Your airfare/travel bill<br />
8. The panels<br />
9. Playable D3, SC2, or Cata<br />
10. A very slim chance to actually nom on Ghostcrawler or Chris Metzen<br />
11. The goodie bag - 2009's was lacking compared to 2008<br />
12. The gift (free mount/pet) - also given to DTV/stream purchasers<br />
13. Access to the store - many 2009 items were carried over from 2008<br />
14. The concert on Saturday night<br />
<br />
The Cons are starting to outweigh the Pros. 2009's concert, despite being Ozzy, wasn't that great. 2008's was better in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It looked like 2009 wasn't a good year because there was a lot of filler/in-between content to discuss. Cata was announced, but they couldn't go into details and the same for Diablo and SC2. Hopefully this year will have a bit more razzle-dazzle involved.<br />
<br />
And for all the east coasters who are complaining about the con not being on the east coast, if you guys were smart, you'd pay attention to New York Comic Con's website. I couldn't go to Blizzcon last year, but was able to talk to and get Metzen's autograph with NO line at the NYCC last year. Don't know if he'll be returning this year since NYCC falls 2 weeks before Blizzcon.</div></div><hr />

Nice. I was close enough to him in the Hilton lobby to nibble his ear, but couldn't get his autograph. It was after-Con and some fanboy was already grilling him with questions.. he looked a bit frustrated, heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly what I was thinking. Didn't Blizzard mention something at BlizzCon 2009 about Goblin Rogues annoying everyone by the next BlizzCon? Now that I see it's a late October event this year, that makes me wonder if Cataclysm will be out around August or September, perhaps even July.</div></div><hr />

Thankfully I was able to watch it while I was at work, I really hope they do it again to, for there is no way I can make an actual trip like that any time soon.</div></div><hr />
