Guild banks<br />
Guild banks are available in most capital cities (including Scryers and Aldor banks) ! Each tab can contain 98 items and you can purchase up to 6 of them.<br />
1st tab : 1 gold<br />
2nd tab : 10 gold<br />
3rd tab : 100 gold<br />
4th tab : 1 000 gold<br />
5th tab : 5 000 gold<br />
6th tab : 10 000 gold<br />
<br />
Everything is updated in real time (you might have to wait a few seconds to update settings). One interesting feature undocumented in the patch notes is a permission allowing people to take only X stacks from a tab per day. <br />

Imho they will never make the MS shot to be as good as the warrior MS or it would render the latter far less important. Hunters are a ranged class so 3.5 cast on a long distance skill is not *that* bad. And further it can be speeded up through abilities and haste. Asking for a low timecast (or even instant) is a bit similar to mages asking invisibility to be on par with vanish....<br />
<br />
Also read on the official forums that the hunter melee range had been reduced to 3y (so a 3-4y 1 yard long DZ). And - something I really doubt - some reported that all melee had been affected by this (we can imagine the whinefeast).</div></div><hr />

I don't think it is ridiculous. 10k is not much for a large guild, and only large guilds will need the full slots. Could be cheaper, less steep increase? sure, but not *that* important.<br />
<br />
and like previous poster said, the first slots are really cheap.</div></div><hr />

But 3.5 Secs? Every Idiot can run in Meleerange during this cast. 2.0 okay, but did u ever see someone casting a 3.5 Sec Spell in the arena during a fight? I guess not or only in some very rare cases.<br />

The Guild bank isn't meant for single players. For the most real Raidguilds the 10k Gold for the last slot is expensive, but not unaffordable. 20k+ should be nothing impossible, if u're raiding other Dungeons as Kara.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
only if they start running towards you really fast :) - and there are ways to reduce the cast time (not going to venture on that because I'm not that familiar with hunter talents and effects). 3.5 may not be ideal, but like I said, Blizzard will put it so it can be used sometimes, not always (like invisibility). This is supposed to be a group buff, not 1on1.</div></div><hr />

Its not unaffordable but why would would you even think about waisting 10k of your guild funds when several officers can each have a bank for a fraction of that amount with more then 98 slots and wich atm they probibly already have set up.<br />
<br />
I think most guilds will get the first 3 maybe 4 tabs to make it easier to distribute marks and pot and showcase some epic recepys so ppl can see if they want something and thats going to be it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Its too little room for too much gold (in total) implemented too late in the game.</div></div><hr />

Any guild can easily afford 4 slots and while 5 and 6 might be expensive just the first 4 will give you enough space for about 5 to 10 items per guild member (assuming a 30 to 60 person guild) which is a lot.<br />
<br />
Also it provides ease of use in many ways, you won't end up with a ton of useful items sitting rotting in the guild bank because nobody knows what is in there and having reasonable access controls will make it a lot easier to manage. If you dont like them, you don't have to use them and the existing methods will still exist should you prefer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not that good argument. There are other races than trolls and i bet those players don't want to waste their Rapid Fire for one or two Aimed Shots. Haste is another point, which only a small percentage of players will have in Arena (even after ZA, Arena Sets are much more worth).<br />
What use has a buff, when it's only used every 20 Arena match? We had enough of such &quot;buffs&quot; which weren't as useful as they might have been, Blizz should thik till the end and not stop half.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all, the price of the 3rd tab and after is far too expensive but I doubt many guilds will need anymore than two tabs. Basically a guild master will have to set the guild bank permissions of each class from the &quot;Guild Control&quot; tab. In here is various options like &quot;View Logs&quot;, &quot;Deposit&quot;, &quot;View Tabs&quot;, &quot;Withdraw gold per day&quot;, &quot;Withdraw stacks/items per day&quot;.<br />
<br />
We tried to repair our items using guild bank funds but we could get it to work. That function seem to have been added yet. Furthermore I found no option in the &quot;Guild Control&quot; part to turn this function on and off.<br />
<br />
It also seems that while members (or any desired rank) can withdraw and deposit items they cannot withdraw gold (only deposit).<br />
<br />
I believe I found some bugs although I have gone to the effort to confirm them yet. We completely filled up one tab with gems and when I tried to view it my WoW crashed, I relogged and tried to view that tab once again but my WoW crashed again. It seems the WoW client has trouble loading full tabs. If you promote someone (and they gain new permissions on the gbank), they have to relog to gain the new permissions quickly (although I do believe they can wait a while and it automatically &quot;refreshes&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Are you guys ******* or something ? Please think a bit before you post crap like this.<br />
<br />
The Guild Bank is just that - a GUILD BANK. Its not a bank for individual players who have 7 alt banks they want to replace.<br />
<br />
Naturally, people will want to use it like that, which is why the first 3 tabs are rather cheap, so that everyone can afford it. After that, the tabs are expensive enough, so that only serious Guilds can afford the increase.<br />

In the days of olde, the last personal bank slot was already priced at 100g. That was 100g for 16 slots and with the pre-BC economy, and many players did buy it.<br />
Depending on class (number of sets to build for whatever role) and collection-drive, space can be much more valuable to people than what you think (and in that case alts aren't the solution since most collection item are soulbound).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly.<br />
<br />
I love that the new 25 will be in a Blood Elf territory. That'll bring extremely beautiful gear to the game. The Blood Elfs do have a taste for looks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Vengeful Gladiator's Refuge (healing set) has been changed, all MP/5 bonuses are modified into +spirit. (Old stats available here)<br />
<br />
<br />
In my opinion Blizzard current design of druids is a little inconsistent. <br />
On the one hand Spirit is one of the most important stats for a resto druid (Tree Aura, Talent: Living Spirit...) on the other hand stacking Lifebloom is the only way for a druid to heal very mana efficient. <br />
<br />
The problem: Using stacked lifebloom will keep you inside the 5SR for almost the complete fight, preventing the full mana regeneration you would gain from spirit (I know that Intensity mana reg will be improved in 2.3). <br />
<br />
Switching MP5 to Spirit on Vengeful Gladiator's Refuge will boost tree aura, but in the end will give you less mana reg. <br />
<br />
What do you think?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Guild Bank is just that - a GUILD BANK. Its not a bank for individual players who have 7 alt banks they want to replace.<br />
<br />
Naturally, people will want to use it like that, which is why the first 3 tabs are rather cheap, so that everyone can afford it. After that, the tabs are expensive enough, so that only serious Guilds can afford the increase.<br />

You really have a good way of argueing, resorting to personal insults. Please think before you post comments like that and learn some self control as I really do not want to participate on this website if I have to read comments such as yours. I have reported your comment and hopefully you will be dealt with.</div></div><hr />

While he's being aggresive on the edge of personal insults, he is in fact quite right tho. People should learn to think and not say &quot;Nah, I'm too lazy to think about it, I'll just spam a random forum&quot;. I'm not registered in SO many other wow forums 'cause of that. Even the biggest other side running next with mmo-champ is full of complete idiots.<br />
I'm sry, I seriously can't understand it myself.<br />
<br />
p.s. I'm not targeting you or anything. It's an overall summery.</div></div><hr />
