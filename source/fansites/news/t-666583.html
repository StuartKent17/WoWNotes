Indeed, but with a limited number of attempts, it's important to take it slow, and don't wipe to stupid shit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, there is absolutely nothing special about a druid doing so much hps.<br />
I repeteadly crushed the 9k5 hps mark on iron council hardmode every week, with a personal best just slightly over 10K. And that was without the gear they have access to now...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
One, its not easy. Its camping your global cool down to keep rejuvenation rolling on 14 targets at one time and still being able to hit wild growth (rejuvenation only last 15 seconds so given a 1 second gcd which I believe is the cap unless they removed it) the most you could ever get it on while constantly casting it on (assuming you throw wild growth in which you most likely will seeing it does more over all raid healing) is 14 targets. Also, you would probably have wild growth and rejuvenation glyphed because that is all you would be casting so you wouldn't really need to worry about nourish, swiftmend, or innervate glyphs (because you don't really use that much mana just chaining wild growth and rejuvenation).<br />
<br />
What this fails to take into account though is yes while its awesome its also hots. Hots are great, but they don't heal instantly. That means the target is still vulnerable to being killed. CoH on the other hand was the most powerful priest heal and replaced all of their other heals quite easily and instantly healed. If CoH was a hot then Blizzard wouldn't have changed it and it wouldn't have replaced all the other priest heals.</div></div><hr />

Really? You mean the US servers that were down till 8-8:30 pm at night on most realms? <br />

We unlocked ours last night by 11pm but our raids end at 11. But we also didn't get started till 9pm and are definitely not in the top tier. So I expect others unlocked and down heroic bosses later into the night.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He's got a point. You can check a variety of forum threads for inconsistent bugs cropping up all over the place. On some servers the bosses weren't even dropping the right tokens and ilevels on their hard modes. On some servers normal mode bosses were replaced by their hard mode versions, etc.</div></div><hr />

Not that i care too much, just pointing this fact out to you ^^<br />
<br />
<br />
You see, that whole server being down thing was just a huge conspiracy by Ensidia and their man on the inside Captain Blizztardo. He crashed the US servers so that Ensidia could get the first kill.<br />
<br />
Seriously, I love how people bitch about Ensidia being there first and making a video of the kill. The same people then go study that video before even attempting the kill. So in short, while Ensidia got there first their video will benefit all.</div></div><hr />

Here is the problem, the USA didn't get to where it is by rolling over and taking it up the arse. It got to where it is because when your beloved Russian and European Union couldn't get its head out of its arse long enough to fix an obvious problem (HITLER) they had to turn to the United States to fix it after they all had failed. The strength of this country comes with people being able to freely express their ideas and to work together for the common good. No other country has really been able to do that. Certainly not Russia. You don't get to be powerful by letting your own people starve to death in the streets while you watch.<br />
<br />
Sure, this country is flawed, but its still one of the best countries in the world. Also, do you honestly think our debt to China matters at all. The United States is the largest consumer nation in the world. That means, China ain't got shit without us either. They don't make money less they can hawk their products that were made in sweat shops, and they can't hawk their products that were made in sweat shops without red necked hill billies that shop at Wal-mart. So, the worse thing China could ever do to itself is recall USA debt.<br />

Actually, it by no means matters. What matters is that you get the best bang out of your entertainment buck. If you are enjoying this game then it doesn't matter how 1337 you are. If half the people that invested as much energy into being 1337 as they do into public service, volunteering and improving the world then things might actually get accomplished. Instead, they decide to destroy their minds with video games. That is not 1337 that is stupidity at its best.</div></div><hr />

If we didn't save anyone then explain why Churchill had to come whine to us like a bitch when Hitler would have crossed the English channel to add England to his list of places conquered in a few weeks after we entered WWII if we hadn't. Make no doubt about it, if it wasn't for the USA then Germany would probably still be ruling all of Europe. Its quite obvious this was the case in history.

Good for you. Why do you assume I give a damn where you live. Also, I love how you can tell I'm getting so &quot;upset&quot; when you are the one making yourself sound like you are 10. Are you 10? That would explain your lack of mental power and the inability to use any words that aren't laughed about when heard by 10 year olds.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pewpewarrows</div><div class="date">2009-09-02, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One, its not easy. Its camping your global cool down to keep rejuvenation rolling on 14 targets at one time and still being able to hit wild growth (rejuvenation only last 15 seconds so given a 1 second gcd which I believe is the cap unless they removed it) the most you could ever get it on while constantly casting it on (assuming you throw wild growth in which you most likely will seeing it does more over all raid healing) is 14 targets. Also, you would probably have wild growth and rejuvenation glyphed because that is all you would be casting so you wouldn't really need to worry about nourish, swiftmend, or innervate glyphs (because you don't really use that much mana just chaining wild growth and rejuvenation).<br />
<br />
What this fails to take into account though is yes while its awesome its also hots. Hots are great, but they don't heal instantly. That means the target is still vulnerable to being killed. CoH on the other hand was the most powerful priest heal and replaced all of their other heals quite easily and instantly healed. If CoH was a hot then Blizzard wouldn't have changed it and it wouldn't have replaced all the other priest heals.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, excuse me. Using WG on cooldown and spamming 1 other spell is hard.</div></div><hr />

How many people do you actually constantly heal in a given raid? 15? I'm betting less. Being a restoration druid has to do with being not the suck. I'm betting you play a priest. In my experience, being a priest has to do with being an over inflated egotistically maniac with a superiority complex that is still all about the sux. You might be the exception to the rule, but seeing you are whining about the CoH nerf 2 tiers after it actually happened I kind of sort of doubt it. Like, omg, ok, you actually have to cast pom, flash heal and poh now. Like that is hard mkay.

I think you sir, are the sad one.<br />
<br />
<br />
I know the truth hurts, but try to deal with it. The truth is, the EU wouldn't even exist if it wasn't for the USA because they only existed because the countries themselves that are part of it were in the crapper before the EU started and couldn't compete globally with the USA, so they banded together to try to compete with the USA, and they still fail at competing with the USA. Sure, their dollar might be more valuable but your actual citizens still get bout 40% of their dollar anyways. Sure, they might have national health care, but our citizens can actually afford to pay for their own health care in most cases. <br />
<br />
Here is a little deal, I'll allow you to rewrite history if the next time there is a world problem you don't beg the USA to come fix it for you, and we won't come fix it for you. Deal. Iran, Russia and China can rise up and globally dominate this world and make the EU their first actual target, and we will sit back and laugh as you ask for help. I mean, after all, you don't need the United States.</div></div><hr />

So the whole point of releasing the bosses was so people wouldn't rush through the raid to get world firsts and be finished with the content in a day or two.

I love how you never fail to read into it. I never once said this. I never said that Russia and England and many other nations didn't have a part in WWII. What I said is, that without the USA they would have had a much harder time winning and probably wouldn't have. You see, unlike you I don't simply hate you simply because of the country you come from. I recognize your contribution. I'm not saying the USA hasn't done a crap load of things to piss the entire world off. I'm not saying its perfect. We owe the entire world an apology for GW Bush and a bunch of other things we have done. Hell, we owe our own people an apology for half the stuff we have done.

I don't think I was alive at the time. You know what, I'm willing to bet you weren't alive at the time either. However, I had many family members that were involved in WWII including my grandfather.<br />
<br />
WWII was necessary. We all worked together to achieve a common goal. In the end, when there is a problem in this world we rise up to face it together. The world has rised up to face Afghanistan and even Iraq together. Even if those were GWs pet projects. Let me be the first to apologize to the rest of the world for GW Bush. The man was an absolute buffoon and I never once voted for him or liked what he had to say.</div></div><hr />

Here is the problem, the USA didn't get to where it is by rolling over and taking it up the arse. It got to where it is because when your beloved Russian and European Union couldn't get its head out of its arse long enough to fix an obvious problem (HITLER) they had to turn to the United States to fix it after they all had failed. The strength of this country comes with people being able to freely express their ideas and to work together for the common good. No other country has really been able to do that. Certainly not Russia. You don't get to be powerful by letting your own people starve to death in the streets while you watch.<br />
<br />
Sure, this country is flawed, but its still one of the best countries in the world. Also, do you honestly think our debt to China matters at all. The United States is the largest consumer nation in the world. That means, China ain't got shit without us either. They don't make money less they can hawk their products that were made in sweat shops, and they can't hawk their products that were made in sweat shops without red necked hill billies that shop at Wal-mart. So, the worse thing China could ever do to itself is recall USA debt.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for derailing the topic. Guess what: Nobody cares if you think you're better, or any other moron thinks he better than others. You are a human, like Russian and Chinese and all others. Just because you happened to be born somewhere does not mean that you are better than others that were born somewhere else. So, let this topic be about Ensidia and WoW, not about which side of the Atlantic is the best. Gratz to ensidia!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh daez&#8230;*Laughs*&#8230;The United States WOULDN&#8217;T have won the war of independence without&#8230;.<br />
<br />
You guessed it&#8230;.The FRENCH!<br />
<br />
See, we can all play that rather low game.<br />
<br />
<br />
You know what. You are 100% correct. So explain to me why in the last 70 years (you know when we got into WWII it was actually to help keep this world from going to hell) we have such severed tensions. I know Bush had a crap load to do with it and the man was an idiot, but seriously, other than him I don't see why the tensions are so strained.<br />
<br />
Also, weren't you leaving this argument? You also assume I went to a &quot;god bless America&quot; school which couldn't be farther from the truth. I went to a college where WWII history basically taught us that the USA profited as much from that war as humanly possible. In the end though, we did end up HELPING to end it.<br />
<br />
Also, the dude that taught all my other history courses in college, including US history 1 and US history 2 was Chinese from China. So, you are insane if you think I only got the rosy pictured glasses frame of the United States history.<br />
<br />
Yeah, the USA has done more to screw up and probably more to destroy this world since the days it began, but its also done a lot of good things too, and I just don't get how you can rewrite history to remove all the good and replace it with all the bad.<br />
<br />
Oh, and yeah Americans probably do have this huge issue with thinking that we are better than everyone else. Nationalism is alive and well in this country. Hell, its hard for us to even think of most countries being equal to ours when they are, and we even have issues with aide being sent to Africa instead of being spent right here in the United States.</div></div><hr />

Nah, imo druids are pretty much AoE healers. It's like having a mage AoE 14 mobs. His damage will go over the top for sure.</div></div><hr />

I have topped that mark plenty of times (and I'm sure plenty of others have to). It's really just a very liberal use of rejuv + wild growth and timely swiftmends. You're not going to hit that mark though unless there is a ton of raid damage ie IC hard mode. You'll never top 9K EHPS if the raid isn't taking that much damage :P<br />
<br />
My guild has only used up about 8 attempts so far (44 left after twins is quite impressive, Ensidia) and we are not quite yet on twins. The fact that that much healing is required from all healers, however, seems to indicate this fight is NOT easy.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haxxored</div><div class="date">2009-09-02, 06:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gotta love the EU vs US dialogue the &quot;were better than them weirdoes&quot; is the essence of tribalism and a serious call back to humanities social roots. Be proud of your backwards and misguided presupposition of others and mindlessly glorify your own particular culture, creed, religion. This right here is why the human animal is doomed to extinction we have to tools for utopia but our social predisposition and psyche is rooted in conflict and competition.<br />
<br />
Make no mistake every nation ever founded was created for the benefit for the rulers and to a lesser extent the people over which they governed. No one forms nations to &quot;benefit others&quot; the do it to help there citizens and themselves if it helps others that’s a bonus if it drives others into poverty and desperation, ya know we can live with that. Honestly now I'm sure a bunch of you are &quot;good&quot; people dedicating some time or money to charities or non profits but when was the last time you did something truly self sacrificing? When did you forgo basic necessities to provide for another? You may be able to come up with one or two examples in your entire life where you truly suffered for another but the scales are vastly leaning towards selfishness and greed in the face of poverty or suffering. Don't feel bad it's human nature, you got to take care of yourself right? Same exact thing with nations.<br />
<br />
Countries created by and run by people carry the same flaws inherent in us all. All actions have a hint of self interest buried somewhere in all that pious, self righteous baloney from EU Green Energy to US &quot;Liberation&quot; Wars. It's all silly and one day it will cost our species everything.</div></div><hr />

Indeed, I've crossed 10k ehps on Iron Council HM... just rejuv+wg and you fly up the meters (we have 2 druids doing that, and 1 guy &quot;cleaning up&quot; after chain lightning, and that easily keeps the raid up).<br />

Buying gold from farmers?<br />
<br />
<br />
lol because when you have 70k gold you need to buy it from farmers? think about it before dumbly accusing people.<br />
<br />
How about look at the buffs - work out from the duration that a mailbox visit could have happened between wipes?</div></div><hr />

Any moron guild can get world firsts by throwing bodies at a boss until it dies but in terms of the bigger goal, it takes some brains to theorycraft stuff to save yourself attempts later. Ensidia are way ahead of anyone else at the moment.</div></div><hr />

recount is without overhealing, your results are incl. overhealing...<br />
<br />
for ex. the pala with 25k heal 80% overheal -&gt; 5-6k effektive healing, nothing special.</div></div><hr />
