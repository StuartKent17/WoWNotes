My guild can only raid once per week and we havn't seen all the content yet I pay the same as everyone else. I should be able to see the Lich King Hardmode encounter but I can't just because I can't raid for 5 hours a day and skip work.<br />
<br />
I think Blizzard needs to start giving out Frost Badges instead of Triumph badges in heroics.<br />
<br />
I think they should also make more pets for the Blizzard store I enjoy buying them because they make my character unique when I am shoppping my capital city. I also think they should make paid class changer because I don't have the time to make several classes and I don't think thats fair.<br />
<br />
I like though that they make 10 mans give the same loot as 25 mans because 25 mans just reward players with too much time.<br />
<br />
I almost forgot about those talents. I like the secondary talents but I think there should be a third and forth kinda like my classes in Modern Warfare 2 I can just choose how I like to play when I join a raid - I think that makes the game fun.<br />
<br />
I like the way the game is going though - vanilla was unfair, difficult and rewarded only people who put in tons and tons of effort I like how I get rewards similar to hardcore players when I can play for 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
Also I like how all items are purple that makes me feel like the skilled player I am. That meany totalbiscuit can go to hell.</div></div><hr />

I forgot that one encounter makes the game hard. <br />
<br />
If 99.99% Hello Kitty Island Adventure could be cleared by Justin Bieber loving 6 year old girls, but that last .01% baffled all but the most experienced gamer, would you call the game hard? We need the other hard modes to be hard and not have the option to go back to normal mode because it devalues the hard mode. Can't beat it this week? Well then you can faceroll it on normal and pick up some abyss crystals and move onto the next boss.<br />

Finally! Now casual players will at least have some chance of clearing icecrown...<br />
<br />
Casuals have always been able to clear icecrown. If you can't clear it all in one week, you can extend your lockout. <br />
<br />
I think what you mean to say is that now bads have a chance of clearing icecrown.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's because the information on the heroic versions of the items came from the Armory, not kills on the PTR. Armory never has any socket bonuses. Been bugged like that since it was implemented.</div></div><hr />

I think they should also make more pets for the Blizzard store I enjoy buying them because they make my character unique when I am shoppping my capital city. I also think they should make paid class changer because I don't have the time to make several classes and I don't think thats fair.<br />

I almost forgot about those talents. I like the secondary talents but I think there should be a third and forth kinda like my classes in Modern Warfare 2 I can just choose how I like to play when I join a raid - I think that makes the game fun.<br />

This shit pops up every time that buff is increased. You know the fuckin' buff is going to mkeep increasing until 30% so why make these sodding comments every time it does? It's like the weather man telling you it'll rain for the next five days and you saying, &quot;Okay&quot; and when it starts to rain you throw your hands in the air and say, &quot;Oh ffs, what the hell is this? We may as well start building an ark or something!&quot; You were told it would happen, why are you acting suprised?</div></div><hr />

I very much disagree with you here, the RS boots do give a lot of health more then the crafted ones (wich are pretty expensive too). Therewith it's not 261, but obviously 264. But still, the RS boots are better for lots of people.</div></div><hr />

Still, we keep reading dudes QQing about that ICC buff that allows a bunch of PU noobs to roll on LK and go HM. That's simply not true.

<br />
Some people on those forums are just hardcore gamerz wanabees who have an ego the size of Ogrim's Hammer Battleship : Blizz can well push the buff to 30 % and, still the majority of WoW players won't kill Arthas in 25 Mode. At the end of WotLK, 25 normal content will be bested only by dedicated raiders and utimate content (heroic) will still be bested by a mere 1-2 % elite as… it has always been the case in BC and Vanilla… <br />

The only change brought by ICC buff is that players won't be able to show off their unique &quot;raiding-elite-only-armor&quot; since more casual players will have their Tier set sharing the same skin… <br />

All goes down to ego considerations. Raiding landscape hasn't changed in WotLK : top end encounters aren't easier, players aren't worse than before (remember the 40-mans with their 4-5 full time slackers and bunch of unskilled players ?) and guilds able to see all the last tier content are still the minority…<br />

A hero?<br />
<br />
Anyways I like how they did the ICC buff 5% at a time. I had plenty of time to see content when it was (some of it) hard. I don't care if other people get to see it with some help 3-6 months after. It doesn't change my playing experience. Also this 5% at a time is much better than how they did Sunwell. It was hard and then bamm one day it was a joke. I do agree some aspects of the game have become too easy but if I don't like it I can always stop playing. From Blizzards POV I can see why they do it. If you're here to make money, which I assume any business is, then it doesn't make sense to design a game around 2-5% of the player base.<br />
<br />
Making the game too easy isn't fun for anyone in the long run. It's kinda like cheat codes in other games, it's fun for a few days, running through walls, having all items etc. but then you stop playing because there is nothing left to do. Same way (the way i look at it) with making everything too easy to get in this game. People stop having any goals, nothing to strive for so you start loosing interest. A good balance is hard to reach though.<br />
<br />
Personally I wish, and this is only one of many things, they would make emblem gear something different than what is obtainable through raiding. They could still have similar stats but don't call it &quot;Tier XI&quot; and maybe skip the set bonuses. Make it possible to get raiding type of gear so if you started late or is switching mains, you can catch up fairly quick but don't make it the exact same. Also this is not to sound elitist but I remember when I started playing the game that I looked at other players thinking, &quot;Wow nice gear&quot;, &quot;That looks cool&quot;, &quot;He must be pretty good since he has X item(s)&quot;, I just don't get that feeling any´more. Everybody look alike and have the same type of gear some just with a higher item level with a fine print &quot;heroic&quot;.<br />
<br />
Another thing I think could help would be to stop all this 10 vs 25 and just make one size, no more overbalancing and debates about different loot. Something like 16-18 people would be perfect in my opinion. I'm aware that the current setup works with groups of 5. I just feel 20 and 15 would be too many or too few in we were o switch to one size raids. Make more &quot;optional&quot; bosses aka Algalon, with only one mode but make them hard. I'm not sure the game needs every single boss to be available in hardmode. In the event we have big instances and time is limited for developers, spend more time on make the actual hardmodes different and harder not just do more damage and spawn a few more adds. So make the average a bit harder instead of having 9 easy ones and then one extremely hard, kinda like they did with heroic Lich King.<br />

Myeh at best I'd say it's a sidegrade you Gain a fair amount of Str and Stam, but lose Parry and Dodge, I think it's a case of if you haven't got the crafter ones, go for the drop, but if you have the crafted, don't bother, as I have the crafted ones, I'm not gunna bother.<br />

<br />
I'm confused, you said that the majority of guilds had killed the Lich King in 10 man. Nothing like that would be remotely possible in BC or Vanilla. I think you want hard modes to be available for the mouth breathing puggers that worship GS we have today. Hard modes are aimed at the elite. Normal modes are aimed at the non-elite.<br />
<br />
I have no problem with people killing LK25. If they kept his difficulty where it is and 30-40% of the raiding community killed him, I'd be happy. It means that there are more people that know what they're doing. I'll admit some fights take practice (sindra and LK), but I'm sure no one needs badges or the gear from the bosses you've been farming. Extend the lockout and get some more attempts in. Once you beat it, it'll be like second nature to you. <br />
<br />
I'm all for people clearing content. I understand that people have obligations to work or something, and can't commit to a weekly raid. I want them to clear content. That'd make me happy. What I don't want are those people that put all 71 points in one tree, wear spellpower plate to tank, get 300 over the hit cap, use healer trinkets to dps, stand in fire, don't switch targets to pad their meters, and flaunt their &quot;epic&quot; GS to people in Trade to kill the LK25.<br />

<br />
I agree completely. In ToC and ICC, Blizzard made the badge grind mandatory for raiders from the previous tier. Badge gear changed from being optional gear to supplement bad drops or catching someone up, to a requirement by everyone who wanted to stay competitive. That's why everyone was trying to do ICC 10 and 25. Instead of Blizzard fixing why people feel the &quot;need&quot; to run both versions, they're simply removing the ability to do so. <br />
<br />
Take tier gear off of badge vendors. Make it a drop again.</div></div><hr />

Then put some nice non-tier robes on the badge vendors. An alternative piece of gear that's available for badges when the player runs into a bad drop rate for an item. That's what badges should be for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can disable the buff if you don't want it. Why do you feel the need to complain because the game gets a little easier for others? The game doesn't have to change for you at all. I don't see the elitists complaining when they get a DPS buff through a talent change but they certainly complain when they lose DPS to a talent change. So at the end of the day, it's all about them being uphappy about what other people are getting which is just about as selfish as you can get.</div></div><hr />

Nobody deserves to have level 264 items except those people who are part of exclusive guilds and can afford to spend 6 hours a day working things out.&quot;<br />
<br />
You can disable the buff if you don't want it. Why do you feel the need to complain because the game gets a little easier for others? The game doesn't have to change for you at all. I don't see the elitists complaining when they get a DPS buff through a talent change but they certainly complain when they lose DPS to a talent change. So at the end of the day, it's all about them being uphappy about what other people are getting which is just about as selfish as you can get.<br />
<br />
This could actually be quite a convincing arguement but I would like to give a different perspective. <br />
<br />
People don't care about when they kill a boss. They only care about the position of their kill relative to the other kills ie. their world ranking / server kill. If me wanting to be further ahead of my opponents is the same as making them &quot;unhappy&quot; then I guess thats true. If I come first I want the guy who comes second to be as far behind as possible. That isn't selfish... it's sport.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- 0.28% of raiding guilds have killed H LK 25<br />
- less than 4% have killed H Sindra 25<br />
- 4,5 % have killed H Putri 25<br />
- less than 8% have killed H Lady Deathwhisper 25<br />
<br />
Still, we keep reading dudes QQing about that ICC buff that allows a bunch of PU noobs to roll on LK and go HM. That's simply not true. The majority of guilds may have killed LK 10 normal but the 25 normal content is still out of reach of the majority of guilds. Only 12-13% have killed Arthas in 25 normal mode. <br />
<br />
Some people on those forums are just hardcore gamerz wanabees who have an ego the size of Ogrim's Hammer Battleship : Blizz can well push the buff to 30 % and, still the majority of WoW players won't kill Arthas in 25 Mode. At the end of WotLK, 25 normal content will be bested only by dedicated raiders and utimate content (heroic) will still be bested by a mere 1-2 % elite as… it has always been the case in BC and Vanilla… <br />
<br />
Nothing changed. Really. <br />
<br />
The only change brought by ICC buff is that players won't be able to show off their unique &quot;raiding-elite-only-armor&quot; since more casual players will have their Tier set sharing the same skin… <br />
<br />
All goes down to ego considerations. Raiding landscape hasn't changed in WotLK : top end encounters aren't easier, players aren't worse than before (remember the 40-mans with their 4-5 full time slackers and bunch of unskilled players ?) and guilds able to see all the last tier content are still the minority…<br />
<br />
So, stop QQing.<br />
<br />
How dare you bring your logic and information to back up your argument into this thread. It simply isn't fair! It makes so many people look like clueless babbling whiners instead of the thought provoking insightful people they are, with tons on factual information to back up their...oh wait lawl.<br />
<br />

<br />
No, it is selfish. It doesn't matter when someone killed a boss after you, people NEVER care about that on progression, people care about who killed it first, every time. The only reason Top 100 gets a look is because they killed it *before* almost everyone else across the entire game. It is absolutely none of your business who kills it after you, or any of your busniess if they kill it at all. And it's perfectly ok to be selfish! It is your right! But that doesn't mean your selfish opinion should be something Blizzard caters to for the rest of the expansion. If other people getting things done actively affects your game enjoyment, I'm sorry, but you should probably get over yourself.</div></div><hr />

My guild can only raid once per week and we havn't seen all the content yet I pay the same as everyone else. I should be able to see the Lich King Hardmode encounter but I can't just because I can't raid for 5 hours a day and skip work.<br />
<br />
I think Blizzard needs to start giving out Frost Badges instead of Triumph badges in heroics.<br />
<br />
I think they should also make more pets for the Blizzard store I enjoy buying them because they make my character unique when I am shoppping my capital city. I also think they should make paid class changer because I don't have the time to make several classes and I don't think thats fair.<br />
<br />
I like though that they make 10 mans give the same loot as 25 mans because 25 mans just reward players with too much time.<br />
<br />
I almost forgot about those talents. I like the secondary talents but I think there should be a third and forth kinda like my classes in Modern Warfare 2 I can just choose how I like to play when I join a raid - I think that makes the game fun.<br />
<br />
I like the way the game is going though - vanilla was unfair, difficult and rewarded only people who put in tons and tons of effort I like how I get rewards similar to hardcore players when I can play for 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
Also I like how all items are purple that makes me feel like the skilled player I am. That meany totalbiscuit can go to hell.<br />

I think there should be no increase. My guild is 1337 and I am 1337. Because I am so 1337 I deserve the rights to see content that no one else can. I killed the Lich King on Hardmode the first week it was out, so everyone else should be able to the second week it was out. I have a wife I bang every night, two kids, a house, a car, a second car and work 60 hours a week, but I still find time to put in the 3 hours you need each week to down the lich king on heroic.<br />
<br />
I think Blizzard made a huge mistake in making anything other than hero emblems in heroics. I had to fight through Naxx, Uld and ToC, so everyone should have to. Newbs should not be able to get 232 gear because its to good for them.<br />
<br />
I hate pets and the Blizzard store. Why should they spend their time develop content for casuals. Casuals are pointless in this game. They don't know how to raid, so only I should get exclusive content. Blizzard should pay me to play this game because I beat their raids so fast that I'm paying to be bored as soon as they are beaten. I have one of every class, so I think everyone should have one of every class. After all, its not like there is anything else to do when you beat raids in 3 hours each week.<br />
<br />
Ten mans should give ilevel 200 loot. Only newbs raid 10 mans. Everyone with any skill raids 25 mans, so it is utter crap that 10 mans give frost emblems they should give ilevel 200 loot and hero emblems.<br />
<br />
I don't understand why Blizzard had to go and make a duel talent spec. I mean, if you want to switch talent specs you should have to pay for it each and every time. If they were going to put in a system like this it should have cost 10k to get access to it. After all, gold is no problem in this game.<br />
<br />
Vanilla was the only real WoW, I hate the way its gone since then. Only people who put in tons and tons of effort like I do should get rewarded for it. There should be a reputation grind and key quest for every instance we enter. If you can't do the grind or get the key you don't need to be in the instance.<br />
<br />
Blizzard messed up when they made easy welfare epics. In Vanilla you had to work for your epics. Since then its all been way to easy. Blizzard also messed up when they started to properly itemize stuff. Its just not the same now that tank gear has defense on it instead of spirit. Back when your gear wasn't itemized right you had to work to over come it.<br />

I wish there were a better way to tell if bad people were bad. But as of right now, according to the only data we have to work with, &quot;bads&quot; are not beating ICC with ANY type of frequency. Not even on normal mode. Not even on 10 man normal mode. <br />
<br />
I could understand some of the complaints more if people were stumbling through ICC in droves, but they just aren't. &quot;If you haven't done *insert some random ICC HM* by now, you suck!&quot; &quot;If you disagree with my antedoctal evidence/opinion, you are a noob!&quot; &quot;Everyone is facerolling ICC and can't tell the difference from me when I sit in Dalaran!&quot; I am not saying YOU are necessarily saying things like this, but you have to be seeing similar things in every newsthread too, right? It's total BS. There's no proof to back this up, and there never was. <br />
<br />
I need evidence. I need information. That's not an outrageous thing to ask for, right? Proof of claims that these things are happening? I can be totally sympathetic of people who have qualms with the game because it's not what they like and want it to be different, even if I disagree. I cannot sympathize with people who make such outrageous claims as above and act like something *needs* to be done because of a problem that isn't there. It's a fallacy. It's annoying and stupid. If more people would admit to saying that they have personal problems with the game instead of acting like the game is broken because it's not catering to them, maybe they would have more of an audience instead of open hostility? I can't be sure, but it couldn't hurt, right?</div></div><hr />

No, seriously :P If you ever check the &quot;scrub&quot; guilds in your server, you'll notice they won't ever kill LK 25 Normal. &quot;OK&quot; guilds will, because when the 20% buff hit on Stormrage, a lot of guilds that couldn't kill him did, and also got 3/12 HM on the first night (WoWprogress is a useful tool to measure it). So don't worry, no scrub will kill LK on 25, although they can always buy the run.<br />

PS: To the dumbass who compared LK 10 man !! With BC's last boss... Shouldn't you compare LK25 HM with him? Cause 10 man is a joke in Wrath. You should wait for Cataclysm, and then ONLY compare 10 man HM with it.<br />

If 99.99% Hello Kitty Island Adventure could be cleared by Justin Bieber loving 6 year old girls, but that last .01% baffled all but the most experienced gamer, would you call the game hard? We need the other hard modes to be hard and not have the option to go back to normal mode because it devalues the hard mode. Can't beat it this week? Well then you can faceroll it on normal and pick up some abyss crystals and move onto the next boss.<br />

Casuals have always been able to clear icecrown. If you can't clear it all in one week, you can extend your lockout. <br />
<br />
I think what you mean to say is that now bads have a chance of clearing icecrown.<br />
<br />
You'll find that 1-2 encounters being hard is the case for most, if not all RPG's. Final Fantasy games are a big culprit for this, the vast majority of the game is fairly easy except for Ruby Weapon, Ultima Weapon, Dark Aeons, Pennance, Yiazmat. I could go on but I won't.</div></div><hr />

LFM ICC 25 PST with spec and GS above 5.5k. Badge gear and welfare tier from VoA say hi! You can faceroll the first few bosses of ICC 25 and the raid leader won't care as long as you're making progress. They only look at people's performance when you start failing.<br />

What Blizzard tried and was pretty successful at with WotLK was getting more players to &quot;see&quot; the end game boss fight. In BC, only 1-2% of the playerbase even made it into Sunwell. In today's game we have a lot more people seeing the end boss of the expansion whether it's on 10 or 25. Hard modes aren't content that people are barred from seeing, because they've already seen it on normal. An example:<br />
<br />
Two years ago, only 2 out of 100 people could drive a car.<br />
Today, 40 out of 100 people can drive a car. But only 2 out of those 100 can drive a different color car.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Agreed, to a point. However, farming the first 4 bosses =/= farming all of ICC. And these bosses, including VoA, only drop some gear, not everything. You certainly won't unlock Hardmodes that way either (though I would understand a desire for a reskin of the hardmode gear so it looked visibly different. It *does* look a bit different, but not much)<br />
<br />

<br />
Agreed again! (to a point) Even on my extremely low progression realm, I have seen people with &quot;placeholder&quot; iLevel gear to stay high up in the character rankings until they actually got some similar iLevel gear. My main personally got burned by someone on my realm who did this, so I can attest to it.<br />
<br />
The thing though, is any raid since Vanilla has always had bads in it also, so it hasn't ever been &quot;better&quot; in that regard (maybe even worse, since more people = higher % of people that can be carried since the raids were larger. I was not around in Vanilla, but a retired friend of mine had plenty of stories and videos to tell/show). If they are being carried, they are being carried by good people who choose to gear up the bad people, via gold dkp runs, mediocre guildies, inexperienced alts, whatever. These things are not exclusive to WotLK by any stretch of the imagination. Why has it been ok before now? I'm not sure I understand.</div></div><hr />

I'm not saying bads didn't exist before WotLK. But the players pugging the first few bosses of ICC25 normal wouldn't have been able to pug any of the bosses in sunwell. Punishment for being bad in BC/vanilla was that you wouldn't be able to see the raid content. Now bads can go into ICC25 and get gear, which rewards them for playing that way. <br />
<br />
I think you got your math-thing mixed up too. The % of players being carried doesn't change, just how large the group is.</div></div><hr />

1) I dont particularly like to pug, so have to wait for guild to form a raid.<br />
2) guild forms a raid once a blue moon, so i keep myself un-saved out of loyalty until sunday/monday.<br />
3) on the night before reset, its all desperate last minute pug raiders and you can't be picky because all the 'good' players are saved... these pugs barely make it past saurfang.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have no feelings good or bad towards the buff... i know the game is 'easy' to a certain extent... but the buff doesnt really HURT anybody. its not like your class got nerfed, or yyour counter-class got buffed... people will still drop group from a wipe off marrowgar (yes it happens)... people will still ninja log right after saurfang because thats all they can do for the day leaving the rest of the group to disband because nobody wants to get saved to a pug that might not even make it past saurfang.<br />

<br />
Don't get me wrong, I don't complain. It's rather awesome. 5-SECOND DANCE! : D</div></div><hr />

<br />
lol, all you need is 3k, what you talking about. Hell, my dk in ilvl 232 gear can do 10k on mob pulls and 7k on bosses. NOW I CAN DO OVER 9000!!!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Swat</div><div class="date">2010-06-24, 02:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This increase is too low I think 10% increases each week would be more satisfactory. My guild can only raid once per week and we havn't seen all the content yet I pay the same as everyone else. I should be able to see the Lich King Hardmode encounter but I can't just because I can't raid for 5 hours a day and skip work.<br />
<br />
I think Blizzard needs to start giving out Frost Badges instead of Triumph badges in heroics.<br />
<br />
I think they should also make more pets for the Blizzard store I enjoy buying them because they make my character unique when I am shoppping my capital city. I also think they should make paid class changer because I don't have the time to make several classes and I don't think thats fair.<br />
<br />
I like though that they make 10 mans give the same loot as 25 mans because 25 mans just reward players with too much time.<br />
<br />
I almost forgot about those talents. I like the secondary talents but I think there should be a third and forth kinda like my classes in Modern Warfare 2 I can just choose how I like to play when I join a raid - I think that makes the game fun.<br />
<br />
I like the way the game is going though - vanilla was unfair, difficult and rewarded only people who put in tons and tons of effort I like how I get rewards similar to hardcore players when I can play for 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
Also I like how all items are purple that makes me feel like the skilled player I am. That meany totalbiscuit can go to hell.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I dont agree with nothing but I lold big time reading this.</div></div><hr />
