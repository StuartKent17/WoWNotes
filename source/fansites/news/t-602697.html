The 2.3 post will still be updated and I will probably highlight the changes in the news posts as well when something is added. I'll stick to the &quot;short news&quot; format for a while, let me know in comments which one you prefer, the old one (all blue posts reported here) or this one (just a short summary). Remember that you can get the [Shiny shiny epics from the Headless Horseman] (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/headlessloot.jpg) starting from today, head to the SM Graveyard with a group !<br />
<br />
This means that you should be able to get information from the RSS Feed (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?type=rss;action=.xml;board=2.0;sa=news;) again. (Except if it's bugged, which is what I'm checking by posting this news ^^)<br />
<br />
Most of the server issues are resolved and you shouldn't experience login/logout problems anymore. If you never did it, now might be the perfect time to register on forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?action=register).<br />

2.3 Testing<br />
Hortus posted a very long list of known 2.3 bugs (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2366574908&amp;postId=24740650023&amp;sid=1#0) on the test forums, it could be a good idea to check it before reporting anything.

<br />
Shamans<br />
Spirit Weapons 30% threat reduction doesn't apply to white damage only, it also affects stormstrike and windfury procs. (Source] (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2366705410&amp;postId=24746657298&amp;sid=1#1))<br />
The first tiers of the enhance talent tree might be changed in the expansion. (Source] (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2366705410&amp;postId=24746657637&amp;sid=1#9))<br />
Earth shield will be changed, but maybe not in time to be added to the 2.3 patch. (Source] (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2366685240&amp;postId=24746657219&amp;sid=1#3))<br />
They can't really nerf &quot;totem twisting&quot; (dropping two totems one after the other to get both buffs for 7 seconds) for the moment and don't think it's a big problem. (Source] (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2366685040&amp;postId=24778154293&amp;sid=1#83))<br />
Concerns for the Shaman class are : Crowd control, Totems, Earth Shield being dispellable, Lightning Shield being too expensive, Shamanistic Rage being useless in 2.3 if not made exempt to dispell, itemization for enhancement and enhancement shamans.

PvP<br />
There are still no plans to reset the honor points when the 2.3 goes live. (Source] (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2366685220&amp;postId=24677158987&amp;sid=1#6)) (Note: According to older blue posts, arena points either)<br />
New bonus to equip on Season 3 gloves won't be added to Season 2 and Season 1 gear. (Source] (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2366664439&amp;postId=24689950453&amp;sid=1#2))<br />

Wrath of the Lich King<br />
The arts and models of the Death Knight we could saw during the Blizzcon and the GC were not finalized and will probably change. (Source] (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2366554454&amp;postId=24740649012&amp;sid=1#21))<br />

2.3 Patch<br />
Two small additions, I'll probably take the time to change a few things in the big post and will let you know the list of the changes when I'm done. Anyway, we've got a nice Zul'aman map here from Regis on Sunstrider-EU and recolored versions (but not used in game yet) of Zul'aman weapons from Endarion. I've got tons of screenshots sitting in my mail/PMs and I'll post more of them during the next days, thanks to all contributors your work is much appreciated.<br />

Two new screenshots were added to the official site at the end of the last week but I couldn't post them because of all the 2.3 information, so here they are.<br />

<br />
Sorry if you misunderstood, I meant the weapon's color borders.<br />
If you look closely you can see the cutting edges, they just look like cutted out in Paint :P<br />
That's what I meant. ::)<br />

Headless Horseman (70 Elite) is summoned in Scarlet Monestary Graveyard, there is no heroic setting on SM. Go into the Graveyard instance of SM, kill the mobs along the path and you'll see a big pumpkin on the left side. You right click it and get the quest, then click the mound behind the pumpkin to summon him. It's not a hard fight, but he hit my 70 Druid, in average gear, for about 1000, none crit. You do need a group and some decent DPS otherwise it gets messy.<br />
<br />
Once summoned he goes to the person who summoned him, so have your tank ready to tag him. When he hits 1% health he loses his head and his body becomes immune to physical attacks, however his head floats about randomly, not attacking anyone. His body continues to waddle about doing a spinning attacking and hitting for about 600 on my druid. Target the head and DPS it down. Eventually he gets his head back, and full health, and goes back to the person highest on the aggro list, hopefully your tank.<br />
<br />
Second stage, same as the first.<br />
<br />
Third stage he summons pumpkin adds which are annoying and will take down a cloth/leather healer pretty fast, so tank needs to be aware. When they spawn you have a few moments before they start moving around so the tank can get a few whacks on them. When he loses his head on the third stage kill the head, nothing else matters, just nuke the head down. Once the head is dead his body dies. <br />
<br />
If your DPS is a bit shoddy you may enter a fourth stage, which is the same as the third. Get too many pumpkin adds and it gets quite chaotic.<br />
<br />
You can do this quest daily per character. Each character can summon him once a day, so a 5 man group can summon him 5 times by resetting the instance. Remove someone from your group and get someone else and they too can summon him. If you have alts, they can summon him too.<br />
<br />
Hope the above helps someone, I'm not the greatest at writing tutorials, tis how I remember it going.</div></div><hr />
