With every build I sit here and hope the sims are as inaccurate for hunters as people have said. Maybe that will justify these nerfs :(</div></div><hr />

^^ pre patch death strike was a spam spell, hit for 80 - 90k in my crap gear, now it has a stacking mechanic (More damage at higher stacks) i do about 20k crit damage death strikes with full stacks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not quite sure this is a nerf though, I'd say it's just relocation of the damage. They want them to do more direct damage instead of damage on dots, meaning it was probably not bursty enough in PvP.</div></div><hr />

I feel the exact same way.<br />
At the moment hunters feel broken and underpowered compared to all other classes.<br />
<br />
During Dragon Soul I was usually always at the top of the meters on nearly every fight, just below our rogues with legendary daggers.<br />
Now I scratch the bottom alongside balance druids, with a huge difference in DPS between the top and bottom players.<br />
<br />
While everything is tuned to 90 now, I doubt anything is going to change at 90 if the current state of some things don't get buffed.<br />
Bursting 100k DPS at the start of a fight since Beast Mastery has so many freaking cooldowns to pop now, is nice and fancy, it doesn't matter if we top out at 40k~ish during stable non-movement fights. (Obviously, tweak the numbers to what it would compare to at level 90)<br />
<br />
That's just plain wrong. While there always has to be someone at the bottom of the meter, why don't we ever see mages at the bottom of the meter? Oh right, master-class, of course. <br />
<br />
I've been staring blindly at the sims for a good week now and after raiding 2-3 times, I can safely say the current 5.0.4 sims looks to be rather accurate. Me and a good balance druid friends were mindblown how shit we are in raids now, barely bringing good enough DPS and not even enough utility to be worth the hassle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I dont understand at least is why they cant have the hunter specs balanced. The difference between BM and MM on the sims is huge. Add to that the fact that MM is the least mobile of the 3 specs and with less aoe it should be higher on a patchwerk fight sim. I keep waiting to see some MM buffs but all SV and MM get are &quot;more damage from this, less from that.&quot; What I would really like is for them to reduce readiness CD to 3 min for MM back to the way it was. Its so annoying to have to wait 1 or 2 min on RF because the cd doesnt match up with readiness. It still wont refresh stampede so why not? Probably because the devs dont play hunter and have no imagination(which is also a reason why we cant have the option to not use our pet).</div></div><hr />

As a blood DK I am doing a lot of damage with Blood Boil, matter of fact I think BB does a little too much damage.

The grimmore change is acually live now, also, this is what has made me reroll. I like the warlock class, but i cannot be bothered to micro manage a pet in raids, their just a pain. <br />

<br />
Even if this data was 100% accurate survival does not compare to BM on encounters single target. Survival tears BM apart in aoe, but the improved serpent sting nerf may help close that gap. Any viable player who tests numbers and pays attention to what is doing what will be BM.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What's this for stupid comment? How is a 20 min sacrifice helping anyone to use more pets? It just makes the talent annoying, proper aff and destro locks are still gonna sacrifice even if the duration is 5 minutes because it's more damage. It's a convenience change, if you don't want to sac your pets well, be my guest, but don't tell saccing locks they have to sit on an annoying short duration so you feel more entitled to not use sacrifice, or whatever your argument is behind that comment.<br />
<br />
I for one was extremely happy tonight to notice this sacrifice change was already live. The 20 minutes was pissing me off straight away.<br />

Because what happens to level 90's on beta has an immediate and direct implication on live servers.<br />
<br />
Actually these changes appear to be live on, well, live. :P</div></div><hr />

I thought we were trying to avoid duplicate murloc kid colours? I don't mind if it's obvious to tell them apart like with Murky (?) and the Gladiator blue murloc but if it was Lurky under a different name that'd erk me a bit. More so after all the faffery I went through and paid extra to get him :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not like the 60 minute Sacrifice makes us not want to use our pets even more. I mean Sacrifice is apparently the top talent for Affliction anyway. <br />
THAT'S the incentive to use Sacrifice. <br />
If you're going for Sacrifice you want to keep it up all the time - having a pet out at all with Sacrifice would just be a DPS loss.<br />
<br />
This just makes it so I don't have to keep summoning my pet every 20 minutes just to sacrifice it again. <br />
It's a convenience buff, not an incentive buff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Arcane shot is just a focus dump for Survival which is the spec being discussed. It is not spammed forever by a SV hunter. And I suppose it takes a rocket scientist to play the other classes. (sarcasm)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's true but then again, what buffs do persist through death? I mean before you were casting pet, fel armor, soul link, dark intent, soulstone and soulwell followed by soul harvest after every wipe, now it's a pet, sac and a soulstone/soulwell, and possibly Dark intent (and without the whine of who deserves it more, too!). I think that's a HUGE improvement personally. ;)<br />
<br />
As for Madness, that's super annoying indeed but you can manage - on heroic anyway, I'm not sure about normal - to sac your pet every platform, as every platform is likely to take 2 minutes. It's just a specific encounter design, I guess, to ensure our pets didn't magically disappear or whatever like the Doomguard tends to do when you hop platforms, and it's interacting with sac in this way I guess. Since MoP is only a few weeks off, I doubt they can really be bothered to come up with a new line of code to fix this, now, too, though it definitely would be nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The amount of ignorance on this post is too damn high...<br />
The reason hunters are spamming arcane shot is because we still have our t13. the 2 piece bonus set gives our steady shots/cobra shots double the focus.<br />
Pre-patch this was from 9 to 18 focus per cast, now its from 14 to 28. Ignoring the focus gained while casting (4 focus per second). So yeah, we are swimming in focus. So what, that doesn't make us a arcane mage, where the more mana the higher dps. On the contrary, it butchers any form of &quot;priority system&quot; we had. <br />
So yeah, nerfing sv's aoe, nerfing our dot, buffing our signature shot, but STILL IGNORING MM ou pet pathing issues (Madness hc).<br />
It will be fun playing as a hunter in mop /sarcasm.</div></div><hr />

Or they could just be making it a battle pet for the people who already have it and not putting it in game for the rest of us. :(</div></div><hr />

Maybe, but apparently someone(s) managed to grab the quest and shared it in a BG about a month back. http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1128998-Redeem-iCoke-Voucher-Quest-question(s)</div></div><hr />
