B) Aw, Protection / Gladiator nerfs, I was having fun being able to DPS as my favorite spec when friends wanted to try tanking.

Why did they chose to reduce those 2 abilities, when they could have just reduced the 20% damage increase directly in the talent? That way the new Gladiator Stance can be fine tuned and the Protection side of the tree doesn't lose out on damage.</div></div><hr />

It's an unintended consequence though. Have you seen Blood DKs lately? They aren't exactly in a worse place than warriors before this nerf. And as a prot warrior, having no ability that feels strong really ruins it. I becomes part of a mindless rage gain rotation, yes i still survive the same, but there is no character there.

Exactly. I haven't tanked since back in Wrath/Cata and that's when I really enjoyed Prot Warriors. The flavor was all there. Since then I've been fury with OS prot but hated tanking and only did it to help my guild out. Just when Glad started warming my heart not only did several members of my team see hatred in it, but the community started to react just as bad. Glad was made as it was so warriors could have something new to try. Every other tank spec is fine in numbers and overall damage/mitigation with DKs being top but to nerf our main abilities?

Yeah, I'm baffled as to why they did this. I ran some dungeons with a mage and a ret guildie, and both of them had no problems keeping up damage-wise. I've never seen a gigantic disparity, though I admit Glad excelled on singletarget fights -- but wasn't that the intended tradeoff for little AOE?<br />
<br />
Getting really irked with Blizzard simply nerfing to appease the kneejerk whiners. Warrior doesn't deserve nerfs just because a lot of people play it -- that happens because it's a fun playstyle, not OP.<br />
<br />
In fact, I'd say Warrior brings very little to Ashran as well, which has resulted in mostly a ranged spamfest, DK Deathgrips, or Retadins rushing in then escaping via bubble. Warriors have no invulnerabilities like that. So nerfing the one thing Glad did well is going to severely hurt in many aspects.</div></div><hr />

Normally I don't whine about it when a class that I play gets nerfed, but in this case ... I just completely wasted 100 Truesteel ingots. I have no desire to even play my warrior now. Both other specs have a mind numbingly boring rotation and perform horribly, glad spec is wrecked, and straight prot spec is wrecked as a result of Blizzard not knowing what to do with glad spec.

What is the real problem is that def warriors overall got nerfed, when all other tanks speccs to do way more dmg while tanking. They should have nerfed Gladiator only. Actually remove it, because making a tank a DD is a stupid idea. Think about making a def pala into a full healer without any real drawbacks, sounds crazy, and thats what it was, back when def palas healed in the arena.<br />

CoP playstyle sucks as well imho, the dot specs deal even less damage ...<br />
<br />
But CoP excels more than almost any other caster at on the move and single target which is arguably a higher priority in most fights. My only complaint is that yeah, the DoT Specs need some love. Shadow Word Pain and Vamp Touch damage increase is all they really need since that's also their AoE. I'd like to see it so that CoP can use Mind Sear on less than '10 targets' and do well, but 1-3 targets, CoP shines. Also, I find that it is quite fun with weaving between dots and non-dots, switching between low health targets to fish for Shadow Orbs on your main target, holding shadow orbs up to 5 for delay in burst, and of course, the mobility once you enter Execution range. <br />
<br />
At least Shadow Priests had a very strong spec to this point, I&quot;m so glad my friends Ele Shaman is getting buffed(we quest/dungeon together, so it's been rough on him).<br />
<br />
I really do enjoy the play style of Auspicious Spirits as well, but yes, it needs some help either in base DoT damage increase, or in changing the way it or Shadowy Apparitions works. Example, Make Shadowy Apparitions proc rate higher on your last target(not exactly like Shooting Stars for Druids, still would like there to be an encouragement for multi dotting besides straight damage on the targets). That would buff their single target without going overboard, and buffing DoT damage would settle for AoE. For void Entropy, I don't really know since I haven't played it, but I think for as long as it lasts, doing a bit more damage would help, and the increase to dot damage would help them as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can not swap into def stance, that is the only problem. You still have the def spec passive bonuses and a shield (ARMOR) while you deal more single target DPS as any other DPS spec in the game. So more defensive than other DPS specs and more dmg? Is that fair? I would say no. Thats why they had to hotfix it. I am sure they are going to change that talent to reduce the dmg power and give the real def warriors their power back in some way.<br />
<br />
But if you say that not being able to have 100% of the tank bonuses (def stance bonuses) while in Gladior stance is a drawback, then I don't know what to say. The best DPS spec should not have any defensive advantages over other classes, but that's what the Gladiator warrior has/had due to the shield some defensive actives (a lot of CDs) and some passives.<br />
<br />
Gladiator is a fail idea in itself. It either needs to do as much dmg as a full DPS spec and then it is OP due to having most advantages of a def warrior + being a full DPS spec, or it won't and everybody will spec something else for DPS, due to 2 other possible specs providing dmg.<br />
The only usage then would be an off tank that you will only need for some seconds. Press all CD buttons and tank for some time while being a decent DPS spec. But for that, they still have to be slightly below all other DPS specs (at least 10%).</div></div><hr />

He is always under the top 4 DPS specs, sometimes 1st, somtimes 4th, and the top 4 are not that far from each other. Blizzard also has plans to look at MM hunters and Unholy DKs, while windwalker already got nerfed.<br />
<br />
No Pala, Rogue, Warlock, Shaman, mage or priest spec could keep up in dmg with a spec that has so many defenisve CDs and a 1h + shield combo.<br />
<br />
Maybe &quot;the best DPS spec&quot; was a bit over the top, but with most others up there getting nerfed, it also needed a hit, and it should never even be above any other DPS spec in the game, because it is still more defensive than any other spec.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just for clarity, the nerf to rain of fire and the buff to the rest of destro's abilities was due to the fact that even in single target fights, rain of fire was the main source of damage for destro warlocks right next to and sometimes even above both chaos bolt and shadowburn. Not keeping it applied during fights can cost a few thousand dps to drop that should have been there from the warlock's regular abilities in the first place. Additively there is a +40% damage across the board with the other buffs which should be enough including chaos bolt's crit and shadow burn's base damage. Fire and Brimstone can now accomodate for the missed aoe finally.</div></div><hr />

At least Shadow Priests had a very strong spec to this point, I&quot;m so glad my friends Ele Shaman is getting buffed(we quest/dungeon together, so it's been rough on him).<br />
<br />
I really do enjoy the play style of Auspicious Spirits as well, but yes, it needs some help either in base DoT damage increase, or in changing the way it or Shadowy Apparitions works. Example, Make Shadowy Apparitions proc rate higher on your last target(not exactly like Shooting Stars for Druids, still would like there to be an encouragement for multi dotting besides straight damage on the targets). That would buff their single target without going overboard, and buffing DoT damage would settle for AoE. For void Entropy, I don't really know since I haven't played it, but I think for as long as it lasts, doing a bit more damage would help, and the increase to dot damage would help them as well.<br />
<br />
yup, hoping to see more warrior nerfs</div></div><hr />

Lava Burst now has a chance equal to the character's Critical Strike chance to trigger an additional Multistrike. This is separate from the standard two chances for Lava Burst to Multistrike; one Lava Burst could trigger up to three Multistrikes (two standard Multistrikes, plus one more from Critical Strike chance).<br />

<br />
F&amp;B will now require close to 8 mobs in the pack to keep ember generation even. And RoF damage at top is just... no. I believe this was a direct result of PvP players using charred remains and RoF for infinite ember generation for Ember Tap spam. Should have just put a cd on charred remains and tweeked the damage reduction of abilities already baked in to F&amp;B. AOE is now shot for destro. 4 mobs will not allow for ember generation with conflag requiring locks to now build up embers prior to using aoe and only good for 3-4 spells unless there are 8 or more mobs.</div></div><hr />

Rogues are in a good place, at least combat is. Blade Flurry is great on group trash, Glyph of Vanish and Energy are good boosters. Rogue DPS is garbage if you aren't enchanted and under ilvl 610 but once you get decent gear and enchant its really good.<br />
<br />
In the 5man heroics with people at the same ilvl, 630, as me I'm either 1 or 2 in DPS on both trash and bosses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Selfless healer only increases the healing onto other targets (20/40/60% or 35/70/100%), predator's swiftness did it on all targets and was way better that way for self healing.<br />
<br />
Predator's swiftness is also a baseline skill for all feral druids, while selfless healer is a talent.<br />

More dmg than an normal def warrior is ok. Being one of the best DPS specs while having a shield and all the defensive skills and CDs of a def warrior was definitely not the intention.</div></div><hr />

and Nerf runeforging for DW the 5% increased str is not enuff for 2hand frost.<br />

Uh does same dmg as frost almost but beats the living crap out of frost in aoe.<br />

Wake the hell up blizzard you have had since MoP to fix dk dps you still havnt delivered.<br />
<br />
necrotic plague is good for UH, but shit for Frost, BoS is awful for ST but an ok for increasing your aoe as frost but still not a talent u want as DK u want somthing that effect our rune system/damage somthing somthing more intressting that fits.<br />
<br />
Make somthing like Hunters &quot;exotic ammunition&quot; so every specc suits.<br />

<br />
Rain of Fire was such a huge part of our damage and ember generation. <br />
<br />
Yes it needed to nerfed as using it on single target felt wrong, BUT it should be tuned in my opinion to be worth casting on a minimum of TWO targets. Not sure where 60% puts it, if you need 5+ targets for it to worth the GCD then I think its over nerfed. Does anyone know the math how many targets needed now?<br />
<br />
Plus with no ember generation on ROF now I think we will may feel a bit starved of embers, especially early on when crit values are so low. Would like to see Immolate generate 25% more ember bits or something, and they can remove it a couple of tiers down the line.</div></div><hr />

Extremely happy to see the shaman buffs. My Lava Lash and Stormstrike actually pack a bit of a punch now; and Lava Burst finally seems to do significant more damage than Lightning Bolt as well. <br />

You still have the def spec passive bonuses and a shield (ARMOR) while you deal more single target DPS as any other DPS spec in the game. So more defensive than other DPS specs and more dmg? Is that fair? I would say no. Thats why they had to hotfix it. I am sure they are going to change that talent to reduce the dmg power and give the real def warriors their power back in some way.<br />
<br />
But if you say that not being able to have 100% of the tank bonuses (def stance bonuses) while in Gladior stance is a drawback, then I don't know what to say. The best DPS spec should not have any defensive advantages over other classes, but that's what the Gladiator warrior has/had due to the shield some defensive actives (a lot of CDs) and some passives.<br />
<br />
Gladiator is a fail idea in itself. It either needs to do as much dmg as a full DPS spec and then it is OP due to having most advantages of a def warrior + being a full DPS spec, or it won't and everybody will spec something else for DPS, due to 2 other possible specs providing dmg.<br />
The only usage then would be an off tank that you will only need for some seconds. Press all CD buttons and tank for some time while being a decent DPS spec. But for that, they still have to be slightly below all other DPS specs (at least 10%).<br />
<br />
<br />
First off, Glad doesnt have everything that a Prot warrior gains, number 1 is def stance dmg reduction, 2 is the normal stam scaling, and 3 the armor they have is largely useless; name me a few fights where the aoe that goes out to hit the raid (dps and heals) isn't magic dmg or some form of unblockable ability, if there were then every cloth wearer can RIP while all plate dps can smile. As Glad you may have shield wall and demo shout (which doesnt affect environment dmg btw, the largest culprit in dps deaths) but you lose def stance, dbts and the raid CDs. <br />
<br />
My main issue is that this change also slammed prot warriors. Nothing feels strong, it's just a tank, plain and simple. I am aware that's the job, but there is no &quot;rage&quot; to the play style, no hard bites back, just SS (for rage) then revenge (for rage and 3 target threat) and then tclap and macro HS and then use Execute when you can, which, at this point most bosses hurt enough where you can't spare the rage for offensive only abilities, especially those with soft enrages which hurt more in execute range (shamans from SoO for ex.)<br />
<br />
I hope they bring back big shield slams for prot. Idc if they nerf revenge, it's downright spammable with 5+ mobs or high ilvl, but the shield slams and shield slam procs should at least feel satisfying not just rotational. <br />

Fact is, only damage reduction you really do have, is kinda Shield Wall, Demo shout and Last Stand. Hot damn. Someone Bring the nerf hammer to that class, it has 3 defensive CD's - One being a 10%, one being larger one (Shield Wall) and the last one being Last Stand, and you have a shield. <br />

Fury does not even remotely get competetive before later tiers due to high dependency on crit and mastery combination - So that leaves us with Gladiator stance.<br />

I don't know exactly what blizzards plan is. I don't main warlock; and i realize this change has a major impact on your AoE.<br />
Maybe blizzard wants a slower ramp up time for destro locks with AoE.<br />
<br />
I think using RoF for single targets was a concept that had to be tackled, but there were other ways to do that I guess. The damage reduction and maybe a cast time would have been more effective than the ember removal.<br />

Classic Blizzard. Why use a scalpel when you've got a hatchet?<br />
<br />
The numbers look big, but when you realize that a lot of these changes only result in a ~5% dps change it isn't that special anymore.<br />
<br />
Shamans will still be bottom tier on single target fights with these changes most likely. However, at least we'll be worth bringing if the player is good enough to warrant a raid spot, instead of being a burden.</div></div><hr />

I've actually seen 9k hits now on a larger armored targets (102 lvl mobs on daily zones), so expect Glad and Prot do even worse in raiding enviroment, where targets have lot more physical damage reduction due to increased armor.<br />

Arms might be bad on this point, but something tells me it's not going to suck while riding so much, due to colossus smash. Setting all warrior specs to be rather medicore on dps'ing department.</div></div><hr />

If they did that and returned cleave it would have become interesting for protection Both fury and Prot feel like an ability is missing in the rotation. Some reduction isn't bad but this and nerf nerf nerf double nerf seem to lack some form of coherent development of the class. On a pretty basic 40% nerf (very simplistic) chugging out 16k will be 9.6k now. Considering the dearth of gear I found dropping in dungeons, crafting gear taking some time, sweet fanny adams dropping from 'key rares' and having to resort to pvp (personally very much not a fan) I'm not sure where the gear will land anytime soon to bandaid over this farce.<br />
<br />
I actually found it quite nice questing/farming to stay as prot and just toggle across, and concentrate on getting one gear set half decent and dungeons were fairly smooth in both specs, reasonably nice damage a help when either under-geared or having an under-geared healer considering how health now ping pongs. PVP (especially being unfamiliar) showed how flexible Prot/Glad could be in either handing some damage out, or hiding behind a shield as a target dummy. Considering how often being a target dummy occurred with stuns I fail to see how this nerf actually works. It isn't like Glad has massive burst damage (which other classes seem capable of dishing out, with some fast kills through SW), or a major DPS CD to abuse, so what exactly do you now do with the limited number of buttons - chew on people or have a picnic in the graveyard?... and as for Fury... they should just have never ending rage because I know what I'd prefer to hit.... several times<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
No. I was paying attention on a few dungeon runs. Pretty easy to do around 14-16k depending on targets. Bears and DK's were doing similar on the same runs and I've seen other classes not being dissimilar when I was tanking. The nerf will likely drop a similar run down to 8-9k, which I've seen alot of people pulling. It has been higher than some but 2x20% ability nerfs on both specs seem excessive given others not being dissimilar. Unless they manage to homogenize every ability exactly the same regardless of class and provide parity across the board (which this raft of changes hasn't achieved) and will likely never happen I fail to grasp the logic of this beyond appeasing the latest fashionable whine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't confuse impossible with not worth the risk and money. They definitely can change the number of slots the default bag has. That doesn't mean it isn't without risk. As we all know from how random shit breaks when you change something completely unrelated, WoW does not have great unit test coverage. <br />
<br />
When they say &quot;It's not possible to change the default slots from 16&quot; it means &quot;There were architectural decisions made in the beginning of development that make this an extremely risky move with no way to know the entire impact before doing it. It is safer to just create bigger bags or implement storage optimization mechanisms.&quot; It's just easier to say &quot;It's not possible&quot; to the 95% of the playerbase who doesn't code in a professional setting with the experience to know that hey, just because something is the best way doesn't mean you can actually do that now.<br />
<br />
When you get more industry experience you'll see that sometimes you have to live with poor design decisions even when you know a better way. This is why having a proper architecture at the start of the project is so important.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why would people who like fury play style switch to gladiator and be quiet? The rotations and skills change quite a bit from spec to spec, and some just don't like to play gladiator. The fact that both specs arms and especially fury are underperforming is evident, and not something pulled out of the hat of magic wishes. Fury might pick up with better gear and crit, but this scaling alone is broken beyond belief. Instead of removing all the shit from warriors, they should have rather found a solution to fury scaling, so it wont be shit at the start and top at the end of the expansion, but be consistent. Arms on the other hand is just broken. <br />
<br />
Also all tanks should be hit by the nerf hammer when it comes to damage, they are there to soak and control the fight, not to dish out more damage compared to dedicated DPS specs. This lunacy of their damage scaling was introduced with vengeance because people couldn't handle old trite and true threat management, at that point tanks were below a fucking holy priest if he decided to throw a smite once every 5 minutes, and it was right so. <br />
<br />
I played prot as the whole of Vanilla, BC &amp; Cata and Mop as an off-tank and I say remove the idiotic damage from all tanks, make tanking harder again, and nobody will miss big numbers, when you have to focus to keep threat up and all the other amazing things to survive, not this sissy shit playstile, where you can't lose threat even if you go take a dump on the toilet for 20 minutes auto attacking.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tmtb</div><div class="date">2014-11-26, 08:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just for clarity, the nerf to rain of fire and the buff to the rest of destro's abilities was due to the fact that even in single target fights, rain of fire was the main source of damage for destro warlocks right next to and sometimes even above both chaos bolt and shadowburn. Not keeping it applied during fights can cost a few thousand dps to drop that should have been there from the warlock's regular abilities in the first place. Additively there is a +40% damage across the board with the other buffs which should be enough including chaos bolt's crit and shadow burn's base damage. Fire and Brimstone can now accomodate for the missed aoe finally.<br />
<br />
You made a mistake, you said &quot;main source of damage&quot; but you meant &quot;main source of resources&quot;. <br />

Curiously this nerf not only removes the resources from AoE (and i think RoF was mainly used for the resources even in AoE, not the damage), but it also removes the resources from single target, meaning warlocks have to cast more incinerates and less chaos bolts. It's quite possible the 8% buff to the other spells doesn't even atone for the loss of the RoF generated resources.<br />
Blizzard is quite clearly pushing destro locks into a nonsense talent that makes your incinerates do less 60% damage, why would anyone find that appealing i have no idea.<br />
<br />
Also, this was the last nail in the PVP Destro coffin, since RoF was quite possibly the only way to generate embers when the lock is being melee trained. Now destro locks really have no mobility.</div></div><hr />

Far as I'm concerned Hunters don't need a buff.<br />
<br />
Unless SV/BM of course.</div></div><hr />

Seems to me an 8% boost to other destro spells will not make up for the loss of damage/embers from RoF which sucks since destro isn't looking so great at the moment without this nerf. Oh well I suppose, rather this than early mists where everyone played a warlock to dps, I'm glad to be a special snowflake again.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard at it's best.</div></div><hr />

Warlocks single damage is already at the bottom, and u just made them harder to aoe, I could not do freedom on 5-target aoe if i didnt pop dark soul while i could do on 4-target aoe even i didnt pop it before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reducing the damage was fine. Means we're less tempted to use it on single target. But AoE? We need those embers!<br />
<br />
I guess that's made crit even more important now, since we need those Immolate crits for embers more then ever. And probably bumped haste up a bit too, and devalued mastery.</div></div><hr />
