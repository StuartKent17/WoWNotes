The World 2nd Kill of Mimiron in hard mode didn't come from Europe or United States but from ... Taiwan! Stars (TW - Crystalspine Stinger) was the 2nd guild after Ensidia to get the Heroic: Firefighter achievement, according to reports they spent the last weeks spending most of their time working on this encounter and this is definitely a well deserved kill.

Battle-Bot is an US-Only Pet?<br />
Earlier this month I posted the models of new Battle-Bots introduced with Patch 3.1.2. <br />
<br />
Battle-Bot - Right Click to summon and dismiss your Battle-Bot<br />
Blue Battle Fuel - Fill up your Battle-Bot with blue fuel.<br />
Red Battle Fuel - Fill up your Battle-Bot with red fuel.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
The drop location of this new pet was unknown until a few hours ago, when the Mountain Dew Game Fuel (http://www.mountaindewgamefuel.com/#/home) site went live. Yup, this pet will most likely be rewarded by the tokens earned on this promotional site and you have to be a legal US. citizen to participate. Even if it wouldn't be hard to cheat by entering false information just to get a WoW pet code I don't think that the NPCs to redeem this code will be available on EU servers anyway, it's probably worth trying but don't get your hopes too high if you're outside the US. <br />
<br />
Even if the pet itself isn't confirmed as a reward, the two different colors of fuel and the mention of a WoW pet in the FAQ doesn't leave us with a lot of doubt. This isn't the first promotional event with a pet reward and Blizzard already held similar contests in China. <br />
<br />
US Players who are interested in the pet can register on Mountain Dew Game Fuel (http://www.mountaindewgamefuel.com/#/home) to get a chance to win this pet. <br />

Blue posts<br />
Vault of Archavon too easy?<br />
We want the bosses in the Vault of Archavon to be doable by a wide variety of players and that includes pugs. Because of the way Lake Wintergrasp works we want access to these bosses to be the reward and don't want to block players from having access to them and able to defeat them. <br />
<br />
Random drops in VoA<br />
Yeah, some players can get lucky and get everything in 1-2 weeks, some others get none in 2-3 months. So far we have liked how the system has worked with a couple random pieces dropping that get spread out among a lot of players. How your guild loot system works is up to you, but I know some players adapt it to these new bosses. If you know the items that can drop from these bosses, you can focus on the other ones first and get these later. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/17162147294-emalon--fail.html))<br />
<br />
[...] I know it's hard to have every class and a wide variety of specs for these bosses, but all it takes is one person already having the item and it gets wasted anyway. We have liked how this is working so far and have no plans to change anything. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/17162147385-refine-voa-loot-rng.html))<br />
<br />
Engineering stealth detection nerf - What about the human racial?<br />
The human racial is still a potential source of concern. We thought the engineering problem was worse because players felt compelled to drop their current profession and grind out engineering just for PvP. While that does happen in extreme cases to races too, you give up so much progress on your current character to reroll that the racial has to be quite overpowered to make that trade worth it. It's a bigger concern on something like the tournament realms where players can change their race easily.<br />
<br />
Like I said though, we did a lot of work on racials for 3.0, but that doesn't mean they are completely finished and polished as a feature. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16904270184-goggles-necessary-but-racial-unnecessary.html))<br />
<br />
Armor Penetration Rating<br />
We made armor pen a better stat in a previous patch. I am fairly confident that many of the posts above decrying this as a nerf are over-estimating how close to removing more than 100% armor you really were. Even if you have two armor pen trinkets and they both proc simultaneously, that is going to be very low uptime. This is not a nerf. It's a preventative measure to keep things from breaking at future tiers of gear or in really exotic situations. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16903658642-armor-penetratation--lack-of-a-cap.html))<br />
<br />
Armor Penetration Rating DPS Increase<br />
Yes. Even against a fully sundered target, armor pen will still improve your dps. For nearly all reasonable cases, it remains a good stat unless you are a class or spec that does a high amount of non-physical damage. The cases were you could currently go negative are very contrived and involved stacking armor pen at the expense of all other stats and hoping your procs all go off at once. We can’t imagine this will be a nerf for anyone currently in the game.<br />

Glyph of Icebound Fortitude bug<br />
There is a bug with this glyph that makes it more effective than intended. The current glyph is basically for PvP situations because it gives you an IBF as if you had a lot of defense, which you probably don't in PvP. It was not intended as a tanking glyph. However there is a bug which makes the glyph better than it should be for PvE DK tanks. We wanted to let you know that we will be hotfixing that bug. If you were considering running out to buy the glyph for tanking purposes you should probably reconsider.<br />
<br />
If you don't have the IBF glyph now, this change won't affect you. If you are a PvP DK with this glyph, the change probably won't affect you. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/17163477544-glyph-of-icebound-fortitude-bug.html))<br />

Starfall<br />
Our two cents is you are working too hard to define Starfall. Many of these threads are of the category of &quot;It behaves like an AE therefore it should also behave like this...&quot;. It's a unique spell. It has qualities of AE spells and dots. It's better against small groups than individuals or large groups. It doesn't have to be channeled. It finds targets for its damage. In this case, my suggestion would be to focus more on whether the spell is effective or not and not whether it &quot;breaks the rules.&quot;<br />
<br />
We think the spell is effective, though it does require a certain amount of finesse to use (meaning you need to use it at the right time). We will acknowledge that Balance isn't quite there yet as a PvP spec, but we don't think Starfall is necessarily the problem or the solution.

Hunters in Ulduar<br />
Just to clarify, we have no plans to nerf Survival. We would like to solve some of Marks' mana problems, though some predictions remain that Marks will overtake Survival with the best possible gear. BM is probably a little behind, which is something we also want to address.<br />
<br />
I will add my standard caveat not to try and overinterpret Ulduar data. The bosses were designed to be very different from each other. We didn't go boss by boss and say &quot;Okay, this is the one where warlocks will be highest.&quot; Put another way, when we make single boss raids, we don't expect to see a 10-way tie for dps. I'm not saying the PvE damage is perfect (though compared to where it's been historically it's honestly not bad). You just have to examine things on a case by case basis and not just link wowmetersonline as conclusive proof that things are off. Take a fight like XT -- it's an almost perfect situation for rogues, while hunters are often asked to help deal with adds. It shouldn't be too surprising that rogue numbers come out very high for that fight. Kologarn and Mimiron are rough on pets.

Another tanking cooldown<br />
We're not going to give paladins a warmed over version of Last Stand. We do recognize that they need another cooldown. Our plan is for something slightly different. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/17157725610-gc-protadins-need-an-answer.html))<br />

Armor Penetration Rating<br />
Stacking armor pen at the expense of all other stats is not a reasonable or intended way for warriors to “catch up” to rogues. It’s still a good stat for warriors. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16903658642-armor-penetratation--lack-of-a-cap.html))</div></div><hr />

<br />
What this says to me is that Blizzard is perfectly content with hunter dps and has no plan on changing anything accept making Marks more competitive with SV. Sure Marks needs to be competitive with SV, but hunters as a whole need a minor buff and some tweaking to be competitive with other pure dps classes. We are falling behind on most fights in Ulduar given the non-static nature of the fights. We need a buff Blizzard! <br />

And we dont have anything really important what we share with warriors, except said shield wall. We're missing a proper interrupt, last stand, spell reflect, and a 4 pc -20% spell dmg every 45sec.</div></div><hr />

They started working on hard Mimiron right after they defeat Yogg-Saron in easy mode (Don't be confused how they can try hard Mimiron after they defeat Yogg, they use other accounts in their tries in first week).<br />

<br />
I would like to briefly introduce the current status of Taiwanese region of World of Warcraft. I'm a quitted bloodelf mage played in realm Wrathbringer-TW.<br />
<br />
There currently are 34 realms in Taiwanese(TW) region, 10 of them are PvE realms. In general, PvE realms in TW are heavily populated with alliance players, while in PvP realms player mostly choose Horde characters. In the entire TW region, Horde outnumbered Alliance with a ratio of around 55:45.<br />
<br />
TW region mainly serves players lives in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau (A Portugese colony returned to China in 1999). In Taiwan, SOFTWORLD internation is the distributer of WOW. They started a sub company to run WOW service in Taiwan, an Blizzard owns around 20%~30% of stock of this sub company, as far as I know.<br />
<br />
In TW region, most players are casual players who do battlegrounds and dailies for relax. The best progression ranks for 25-man raids are usually around world 40~70 comparing to EU/US. There were less than 10 guilds completed Naxxramas at Lv. 60 in TW region, and only 18 guilds defeated Kil'jaeden before echoes of doom went live.<br />
<br />
When WotLK went live, many Chinese players come to TW realms since the new expansion is delayed in Chinese(CN) region. The reason they choose TW realms are:<br />
1) Similar language: In Taiwan, people speak, read, and write Mandarin. The Mandarin we Taiwanese use is somehow different to what they use in China, but we can understand each other well. Most China WOW players are lack of proficiency of understanding English.<br />
2) Easier to create an account: In TW region, you don't have to bind your WOW account to a CD-KEY. The only fee payed in TW region are Game cards for extending available play time.<br />
<br />
However, the population of China WOW players is far above what TW realms can handle. Hence, after the release of WotLK, TW realms suffer from long queuing for login and serious lagging in raiding instances (especially 25-man raids). In rush hours of the game (7pm-12am in the night, and 2pm-12am in weekends), the gaminig quality is extermely bad. <br />
<br />
Many Taiwanese guilds suffer from such bad server status and being unable to progress through hard modes in Ulduar. Take my guild as an example. My guild is &#31070;&#27171; (pronounced Shen-Young, which means God-like) in Wrathbringer-TW. We downed Kil'jaeden in August 2008, and over 50 of my guild mates have completed Heroic: Glory of the Raider. 8 of them are even only two achievements away from Glory of Ulduar Raider (Only Orbit-uary and Firefighter left, they completed One Light in the Darkness top-30 worldwide). But my guild can't even do Heroic: Lose Your Illusion since Thorim charges from four torrents simultaneously while lagging. Not to mention other hard modes of keepers.<br />
<br />
Even STARS and The 7 (another top China guild reroll in TW, they downed KJ among top 10 worldwide as far as I remember) suffer from such lagging situations. They have to raid during midnight to avoid the lags. The first kills of Yogg-Saron for them are at around 4am in the morning.<br />
<br />
The SOFTWORLD International decided not to perchase new equipments to solve this problem, since most China players definitely will return to CN region when their WotLK goes live. However, the specific time for China WotLK goes live is not sure by now, since the distributor of WOW in China will change from 9th city to Netease in June.<br />
<br />
Moreover, China players don't under the concept of &quot;While in Rome, do as the romans do.&quot; For players in US realms, if you see someone spamming in General/Trade/LFG channels, that guy is very likely a China player. They used to do so in China realms. Imagine a lot of such China players in your realm, that's really big problem.<br />
<br />
Moreover, the way China players communicate in games are somehow unacceptable for Taiwanese players. In CN region, the fee is counted in minutes players played. As a result, many China players appeared very impatient while communicating with others. This is not tolerable for most Taiwanese players.<br />
<br />
Also they use strange spelling words to communicate in games since that's the way they teach Mandarin pronunciation in China (in Taiwan, a specific phonetic notation system is used). For example, Mage in Chinese is &#27861;&#24107; (pronounced Fa-Shi), and China players call mages FS, which is not understandable for Taiwanese players. The way chinese players post in LFG channel can be seem like this:<br />
<br />
[LFG]: H FL -4 FS MS DZ SS (Heroic Mana Tombs, look for 4 more, mage, priest, rogue and warlock.)<br />
<br />
Taiwanese players can't understand this easily (I believe EU/US players are even more confused about such message), and such messages even confuse new Taiwanese players, which leads to bad understanding to the game. I've heard someone insists that Zul'Farrak = ZR, which doesn't make sense at all.<br />
<br />
Not every China players are badly behaved in TW realms. I have met many great China players who follow what Taiwanese players do in TW realms and we all had a great time running through dungeons. However, other new-coming China players who does not understand the culture of TW realms severely destroyed gaming experience of we Taiwanese players.<br />
<br />
In fact, seeing STARS achieved Heroic: Firefighter, most domestic Taiwanese players only feel angry and unforgiving against STARS instead of trying to congratulate them, since China players severely destroyed the gaming environment Taiwanese players used to have.<br />
<br />
Although the title of this news says &quot;Stars (Taiwan) beats Mimiron in Hard Mode&quot;, very few Taiwanese players will be proud of them since the success of STARS is on the basis of 200,000 struggled Taiwanese players, I have to say this.<br />

<br />
I'm not very sure about the price of game playing time in Chinese WOW. The China players I know told me it's 30RMB for 4000 minutes. 30RMB is equal to around 4.7 USD.<br />
<br />
In Taiwan, it's 150NTD (around 4.5USD) for 1800 minutes. It's looks 2 times more expansive comparing to in China, but in Taiwan price of goods are more than two times more expensive than in most places in China.<br />
<br />
However, most Taiwanese players use a monthly unlimited game card (450 NTD, or 13.5USD) or a seasonly unlimited game card (1150NTD / 35USD). In China, such unlimited pass is not available.</div></div><hr />

So we should assume they have someone working on the quest for algalon. They also completed hardmode Hodir on the same day as mimiron. What they have left are hardmode Thorim and 3 knock on wood.

That is to curb the abundance of &quot;gaming studios&quot; which will surely get out of control if playtime is handled like how it is done in NA/EU. The MMO-culture in China is simply different from what it is here, and the moderation by GMs are not, and simply cannot be on the same level of strictness due to this difference.<br />
<br />
Just as Marculescu stated, this is most likely why you see some Chinese players as blunt and impatient, but that is mostly how the younger population behaves - they do not hold other's interest something to sacrifice their financial resources for. The more refined members of the community will always behave like gentlemen - but then again that is the case everywhere around the world.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It's generally because WoW release later in Asia than US/EU, usually one to two week later at least. And it's really hard for Asian guild to compete in the raiding race in WoW. You might see a Chinese guild once a while in some of the more stratched out fights like naxx40's 4H, KT, Muru KJ and now mimiron. But on progression like &quot;who zone in the instance faster&quot;, you'll never see an Asian guild on top. <br />
<br />
Eventually US/EU just forget about the asian region. Even websites don't track their progress.</div></div><hr />

But paladins get 5% more healing, better AoE tanking, Scale with stamina, and an ondemand ranged daze. Different strokes.<br />

I don't want to get into a &quot;more paladin buffs??&quot; thing here, it just sounded odd. I don't think I ever heard a paladin say &quot;Gee, I wish I had another tanking cooldown.&quot; That's, all.<br />

<br />
Yes, charge by minutes increases cost of those &quot;gaming studios&quot;, or more specifically, gold farmers.<br />
However another problem arise since they have to farm gold as fast as possible. Hence, many such gaming studios hack into other peoples WOW account and steal all their golds. This problem also happens in TW region, and some of my friends found their characters standing in Orgrimmer AH naked after their accounts are hacked (That's somehow hilarious.)<br />
<br />
Such gold trade is heavily monitored in TW realms though. Almost every people who buy such gold from gaming studios are banned for 7 days to 30 days. I have no idea how this is monitored.</div></div><hr />

In general, PvE realms in TW are heavily populated with alliance players, while in PvP realms player mostly choose Horde characters. In the entire TW region, Horde outnumbered Alliance with a ratio of around 55:45.<br />
<br />
TW region mainly serves players lives in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau (A Portugese colony returned to China in 1999). In Taiwan, SOFTWORLD internation is the distributer of WOW. They started a sub company to run WOW service in Taiwan, an Blizzard owns around 20%~30% of stock of this sub company, as far as I know.<br />
<br />
In TW region, most players are casual players who do battlegrounds and dailies for relax. The best progression ranks for 25-man raids are usually around world 40~70 comparing to EU/US. There were less than 10 guilds completed Naxxramas at Lv. 60 in TW region, and only 18 guilds defeated Kil'jaeden before echoes of doom went live.<br />
<br />
When WotLK went live, many Chinese players come to TW realms since the new expansion is delayed in Chinese(CN) region. The reason they choose TW realms are:<br />
1) Similar language: In Taiwan, people speak, read, and write Mandarin. The Mandarin we Taiwanese use is somehow different to what they use in China, but we can understand each other well. Most China WOW players are lack of proficiency of understanding English.<br />
2) Easier to create an account: In TW region, you don't have to bind your WOW account to a CD-KEY. The only fee payed in TW region are Game cards for extending available play time.<br />
<br />
However, the population of China WOW players is far above what TW realms can handle. Hence, after the release of WotLK, TW realms suffer from long queuing for login and serious lagging in raiding instances (especially 25-man raids). In rush hours of the game (7pm-12am in the night, and 2pm-12am in weekends), the gaminig quality is extermely bad. <br />
<br />
Many Taiwanese guilds suffer from such bad server status and being unable to progress through hard modes in Ulduar. Take my guild as an example. My guild is &#31070;&#27171; (pronounced Shen-Young, which means God-like) in Wrathbringer-TW. We downed Kil'jaeden in August 2008, and over 50 of my guild mates have completed Heroic: Glory of the Raider. 8 of them are even only two achievements away from Glory of Ulduar Raider (Only Orbit-uary and Firefighter left, they completed One Light in the Darkness top-30 worldwide). But my guild can't even do Heroic: Lose Your Illusion since Thorim charges from four torrents simultaneously while lagging. Not to mention other hard modes of keepers.<br />
<br />
Even STARS and The 7 (another top China guild reroll in TW, they downed KJ among top 10 worldwide as far as I remember) suffer from such lagging situations. They have to raid during midnight to avoid the lags. The first kills of Yogg-Saron for them are at around 4am in the morning.<br />
<br />
The SOFTWORLD International decided not to perchase new equipments to solve this problem, since most China players definitely will return to CN region when their WotLK goes live. However, the specific time for China WotLK goes live is not sure by now, since the distributor of WOW in China will change from 9th city to Netease in June.<br />
<br />
Moreover, China players don't under the concept of &quot;While in Rome, do as the romans do.&quot; For players in US realms, if you see someone spamming in General/Trade/LFG channels, that guy is very likely a China player. They used to do so in China realms. Imagine a lot of such China players in your realm, that's really big problem.<br />
<br />
Moreover, the way China players communicate in games are somehow unacceptable for Taiwanese players. In CN region, the fee is counted in minutes players played. As a result, many China players appeared very impatient while communicating with others. This is not tolerable for most Taiwanese players.<br />
<br />
Also they use strange spelling words to communicate in games since that's the way they teach Mandarin pronunciation in China (in Taiwan, a specific phonetic notation system is used). For example, Mage in Chinese is &#27861;&#24107; (pronounced Fa-Shi), and China players call mages FS, which is not understandable for Taiwanese players. The way chinese players post in LFG channel can be seem like this:<br />
<br />
[LFG]: H FL -4 FS MS DZ SS (Heroic Mana Tombs, look for 4 more, mage, priest, rogue and warlock.)<br />
<br />
Taiwanese players can't understand this easily (I believe EU/US players are even more confused about such message), and such messages even confuse new Taiwanese players, which leads to bad understanding to the game. I've heard someone insists that Zul'Farrak = ZR, which doesn't make sense at all.<br />
<br />
Not every China players are badly behaved in TW realms. I have met many great China players who follow what Taiwanese players do in TW realms and we all had a great time running through dungeons. However, other new-coming China players who does not understand the culture of TW realms severely destroyed gaming experience of we Taiwanese players.<br />
<br />
In fact, seeing STARS achieved Heroic: Firefighter, most domestic Taiwanese players only feel angry and unforgiving against STARS instead of trying to congratulate them, since China players severely destroyed the gaming environment Taiwanese players used to have.<br />
<br />
Although the title of this news says &quot;Stars (Taiwan) beats Mimiron in Hard Mode&quot;, very few Taiwanese players will be proud of them since the success of STARS is on the basis of 200,000 struggled Taiwanese players, I have to say this.<br />

<br />
I don't want to get into a &quot;more paladin buffs??&quot; thing here, it just sounded odd. I don't think I ever heard a paladin say &quot;Gee, I wish I had another tanking cooldown.&quot; That's, all.<br />
<br />
The addition may be warranted, but I'm just saying it wasn't exactly a hot topic as far as I knew.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, because only retards specc into 5/5 Divinity and 5% more (over)healing is such a great dmg mitigation. We do need the second best stamina scaling because of every other class has more HP by default (and still out-HP us with a worse scaling), and warriors got a gun spot, we dont.<br />
<br />
Better AoE tanking than who? Last time I checked DKs do more AoE threat and druids are nearly as good as with 360° swipe.<br />
<br />
We arent really a choice for hard hitting or heavily magical dmg bosses in ulduar, which are like 85% of the instance.</div></div><hr />

This has to be one of the most interesting and fascinating things I have read in a long time. Probably the best post I have read on these forums. I had no idea and I'm sorry to hear of this.<br />
<br />
I did hear that STARS had to do this with a lot of lag, but I thought this was because of playing a TW server while in China. I didn't know that the realms were all full due to China coming over or that lag makes certain bosses unbeatable.<br />
<br />
You have to remember too, it is not necessarily the Chinese fault. They are into WoW like everybody else, and it is not good that they are the only country not to get Wotlk. I know English people who played Korean Aion beta because its the only way they could and I guess it is the same. They would probably much prefer to go back and play Chinese server but they want to experience the new content like everybody else. Blizzard really should sort this out as Asia is a big market for MMO's.<br />
<br />
Hopefully soon China will get Wotlk and then they will all go back to their own realms :p It is still a big achievement by STARS though, but thanks for writing all of that, and your English is very good :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for your kind comment. I was also wondering whether my post was too long for everyone to read or not.<br />
<br />
The situation of China players in games of other countries are somehow different. As far as I know English-speaking people bahave very well in korean/Japanese games. So are Taiwanese/Japanese and Korean in English-speaking games (Correct me if I'm wrong).<br />
<br />
However, China players often bring the habits in their homeland to foreign games, that's the problem.<br />
<br />
Among all China players in TW realms, a lot of them called themselves &#39636;&#39511;&#40680; (pronounced Tee-Yan-Dang, which means &quot;experience party&quot; or temporary players). These guys are the most annoying for Taiwanese players. They often beg high-level players to give them some gold, bags, and take them to low-level dungeons to help them level faster. As a mage, while I was playing (I'm a quitted player), I received whisper messages that China players want me to help them do Scarlet Monestry everyday.<br />
<br />
Such temporary players are definitely will return to China realms when their WotLK goes live, and they also causes the most problems currently.<br />
<br />
Actually high-end China raiders comes to TW realms general bahave very kind and well. However, those temporary players don't. Also China players tend to go to heavily populated realms, they think such server has more goods to purchase and can make their gaming life easier, however this increases lagging problem more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be honest, there still exist some Taiwanese players behave like s**t. Of course there always exists somebody ninja loots in PuG raids. :p<br />
<br />
But generally in Taiwanese realms, players follow some unwritten rules (most TW players can understand such rules while they're leveling) and the game is generally peace between players. I had a really good time playing in TW realms, and I hope they can return to what they used to be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would like to briefly introduce the current status of Taiwanese region of World of Warcraft. I'm a quitted bloodelf mage played in realm Wrathbringer-TW.<br />
<br />
There currently are 34 realms in Taiwanese(TW) region, 10 of them are PvE realms. In general, PvE realms in TW are heavily populated with alliance players, while in PvP realms player mostly choose Horde characters. In the entire TW region, Horde outnumbered Alliance with a ratio of around 55:45.<br />
<br />
TW region mainly serves players lives in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau (A Portugese colony returned to China in 1999). In Taiwan, SOFTWORLD internation is the distributer of WOW. They started a sub company to run WOW service in Taiwan, an Blizzard owns around 20%~30% of stock of this sub company, as far as I know.<br />
<br />
In TW region, most players are casual players who do battlegrounds and dailies for relax. The best progression ranks for 25-man raids are usually around world 40~70 comparing to EU/US. There were less than 10 guilds completed Naxxramas at Lv. 60 in TW region, and only 18 guilds defeated Kil'jaeden before echoes of doom went live.<br />
<br />
When WotLK went live, many Chinese players come to TW realms since the new expansion is delayed in Chinese(CN) region. The reason they choose TW realms are:<br />
1) Similar language: In Taiwan, people speak, read, and write Mandarin. The Mandarin we Taiwanese use is somehow different to what they use in China, but we can understand each other well. Most China WOW players are lack of proficiency of understanding English.<br />
2) Easier to create an account: In TW region, you don't have to bind your WOW account to a CD-KEY. The only fee payed in TW region are Game cards for extending available play time.<br />
<br />
However, the population of China WOW players is far above what TW realms can handle. Hence, after the release of WotLK, TW realms suffer from long queuing for login and serious lagging in raiding instances (especially 25-man raids). In rush hours of the game (7pm-12am in the night, and 2pm-12am in weekends), the gaminig quality is extermely bad. <br />
<br />
Many Taiwanese guilds suffer from such bad server status and being unable to progress through hard modes in Ulduar. Take my guild as an example. My guild is &#31070;&#27171; (pronounced Shen-Young, which means God-like) in Wrathbringer-TW. We downed Kil'jaeden in August 2008, and over 50 of my guild mates have completed Heroic: Glory of the Raider. 8 of them are even only two achievements away from Glory of Ulduar Raider (Only Orbit-uary and Firefighter left, they completed One Light in the Darkness top-30 worldwide). But my guild can't even do Heroic: Lose Your Illusion since Thorim charges from four torrents simultaneously while lagging. Not to mention other hard modes of keepers.<br />
<br />
Even STARS and The 7 (another top China guild reroll in TW, they downed KJ among top 10 worldwide as far as I remember) suffer from such lagging situations. They have to raid during midnight to avoid the lags. The first kills of Yogg-Saron for them are at around 4am in the morning.<br />
<br />
The SOFTWORLD International decided not to perchase new equipments to solve this problem, since most China players definitely will return to CN region when their WotLK goes live. However, the specific time for China WotLK goes live is not sure by now, since the distributor of WOW in China will change from 9th city to Netease in June.<br />
<br />
Moreover, China players don't under the concept of &quot;While in Rome, do as the romans do.&quot; For players in US realms, if you see someone spamming in General/Trade/LFG channels, that guy is very likely a China player. They used to do so in China realms. Imagine a lot of such China players in your realm, that's really big problem.<br />
<br />
Moreover, the way China players communicate in games are somehow unacceptable for Taiwanese players. In CN region, the fee is counted in minutes players played. As a result, many China players appeared very impatient while communicating with others. This is not tolerable for most Taiwanese players.<br />
<br />
Also they use strange spelling words to communicate in games since that's the way they teach Mandarin pronunciation in China (in Taiwan, a specific phonetic notation system is used). For example, Mage in Chinese is &#27861;&#24107; (pronounced Fa-Shi), and China players call mages FS, which is not understandable for Taiwanese players. The way chinese players post in LFG channel can be seem like this:<br />
<br />
[LFG]: H FL -4 FS MS DZ SS (Heroic Mana Tombs, look for 4 more, mage, priest, rogue and warlock.)<br />
<br />
Taiwanese players can't understand this easily (I believe EU/US players are even more confused about such message), and such messages even confuse new Taiwanese players, which leads to bad understanding to the game. I've heard someone insists that Zul'Farrak = ZR, which doesn't make sense at all.<br />
<br />
Not every China players are badly behaved in TW realms. I have met many great China players who follow what Taiwanese players do in TW realms and we all had a great time running through dungeons. However, other new-coming China players who does not understand the culture of TW realms severely destroyed gaming experience of we Taiwanese players.<br />
<br />
In fact, seeing STARS achieved Heroic: Firefighter, most domestic Taiwanese players only feel angry and unforgiving against STARS instead of trying to congratulate them, since China players severely destroyed the gaming environment Taiwanese players used to have.<br />
<br />
Although the title of this news says &quot;Stars (Taiwan) beats Mimiron in Hard Mode&quot;, very few Taiwanese players will be proud of them since the success of STARS is on the basis of 200,000 struggled Taiwanese players, I have to say this.<br />
<br />
p.s. Sorry for bad English :p<br />

I see stupid people in this game everyday. Some behave that way in general while others are just doing it for laughs under the protection of anonymity. Being rude, stupid, uncultured or whatever is not something particular to one nation or one culture. Lastly, unless you are a Taiwanese aborigine (who also have to put up with discrimination in the Taiwanese society and are unfairly characterized as uncultured), you are still ethnically a Chinese. You are basically shooting yourself in the foot when you place the blame on Chinese culture or Chinese habit rather than on ill behaved individuals.</div></div><hr />

First, thanks for the informative post.<br />
<br />
However, I don't see anything particular different/wrong of those chinese gamers compared to other young, impolite and impatient kids we see on Euro/US servers. Stereotyping of people based on their racial/region background doesn't warrant your hatred of them. (and AFAIK all Taiwanese are of Chinese origin? ) <br />
<br />
Overall, I think it's inappropriate of you to bash those Chinese gamers for just being wishing to play their favorite game. If anything, you should blame SOFTWORLD, since they are your region distributer of WOW, and they decided to allow the Chinese gamer create accounts in your servers for the extra $$$, yet they don't purchase extra servers to maintain required quality for the game. So you are basically bashing the wrong guy here. You should ask your distributer either to ban all Chinese players or add extra servers.</div></div><hr />

I must agree with this completely. Blizzard has decided to ban IP addresses located in mainland China for whatever reason they have - if softworld really wishes to do so they could, and yet they did not. It is true that there are members from the mainland WoW community that does horrible things, but it is the moderator's job to filter these people out, and softworld isn't doing a thing about it.<br />
<br />
I can understand the frustration from you, but I think the frustration is slightly misplaced.</div></div><hr />

When those badly behaved kids are everywhere in your server, that's a serious problem. What I described is not just about their impatience/impoliteness/ ... etc. What I described is about a large group of China players coming to TW realms and making TW realms into their CN realms.<br />
<br />
Most Taiwanese are indeed originated from Chinese, I totally agree with that. However, Taiwan and China have been apart for 60 years. The way Taiwanese and Chinese think, speak, and act are very different now. Hence, the behaviors in game are generally very different for Taiwanese and Chinese. What I said about China players is not stereotypes, it's what native players really feel. Queuing and lagging is one problem, the changing gaming environment is another.<br />
<br />
To Pyrelight:<br />
<br />
The reason SOFTWORLD didn't ban mainland IPs is that there are many Taiwanese working in China (a lot of Taiwanese-invested companies are in China), and doing so will also ban these Taiwanese in China. And as far as I know, there are discussions about whether to ban foreign IPs or not at the very beginning of WoW franchise, I am not sure about the result, but I also have friends in Taiwan playing in US servers without any problem. If China IPs are really banned in US realms, that's the real discrimination.<br />
<br />
Actually many Taiwanese players also blame SOFTWORLD for not update / purchase new servers to maintain performance. I didn't mention it in my original post. However, the queuing / lagging problems also happened when<br />
TBC went live. TBC was also delayed in China(I remember the first version of TBC in China was 2.2). At that time SOFTWORLD did actually set up numbers of new realms to cope with China players. However, after China TBC is online, those additional server becomes &quot;ghost realms&quot;, realms with very low population and have to be merged / closed. As a result, SOFTWORLD will hesitate to do so. They did open new realms recently, but these new realms then soon filled with new China players, and the lagging still continues. Rumor has it that these new realms are believed to be set up by partition of available servers instead of new purchases.<br />
<br />
I have to admit I didn't say it clear enough in my original post. Lagging and queuing are due to multiple problems, but my conclusion seems blaming them all to China players. Taiwanese players really feel bad when seeing STARS done Heroic: Firefighter. I have to say STARS is a punching bag. I used to be a hard-core raider (I controlled blue dragons against Kil'jaeden in 2.4 :p) so I think what STARS achieved is admirable. However, the struggling situation of Taiwanese players facing should be concerned.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Thanks for your information of the current situation of WOW in TW region. But I'd like to further explain some details.<br />
<br />
1.language matter<br />
There're 2 types of Chinese. Traditional Chinese is commonly used in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and other South East Asian countries. And contemporary Chinese, which is more often called Simplified Chinese, uses in Mainland China, and the immigration of the majority oversea Chinese. The difference is just like Portuguese in Portugal and Latin America. Both users of traditional Chinese and contemporary Chinese can understand each other's writing and speaking very well. The only obvious differentiation is of the writing style of certain Chinese characters. This differentiation originate from 1960s when Mainland China would like to carry out a project to accumulate the literate rate, where they found one notable difficulty is because some Chinese character is too complex to write(which even you guys can easily identify &#27171; as traditional Chinese and &#26679; as contemporary Chinese), they finally simplify them and it is proven to work in the next 20 years. So generally users of contemporary Chinese have 0 problem to understand traditional Chinese, and as the users of contemporary Chinese populated all around the world, most users of traditional Chinese can understand contemporary Chinese in the communication.<br />
And the shortcut thing, I don't think there's a barrier for traditional Chinese to understand the shortcut of contemporary Chinese. The shortcut originated from the different systems of phonetic notation. For almost every Chinese character, the initial letter in both phonetic notation systems is the same. Take 'mage' as an example:<br />
&#27861;&#24107; spelled as 'Fa-Shi' in the phonetic notation system of traditional Chinese, and 'Fa Shi' in contemporary Chinese, and the shortcut 'FS' uses the initial letters, which is the same in both 2 types of Chinese. <br />
<br />
2.why STARS goes to TW servers<br />
The apparent reason is there's NO WotLK in MAINLAND CHINA for now and maybe a long time after. The charge mode is definitely not a reason since though there's no available charged by month, but the fee charged by time online is less than 1/2 of which in TW servers, there the fee can be charged in either by month or by time online.<br />
Try to imagine your server is 'Echoes of Doom' for more than a half year. It's so ridiculous since<br />
1)There's no arena. You cannot compete in arenas since Season 4 ended so the best armor set you can get right now for PvP is Season 2.<br />
2)Talents up to level 80. It greatly enhanced the ability of some damage dealer while at the same time no improvement for most cloth classes. So you may find battlefields are full of arcane mages, they can take down a cloth class for only 2 hits by arcane barrage. <br />
3)Bugs that won't be fixed. Check out the talent 'Honor Among Thieves' of subtlety rogue. Its description says it cannot occur more than every second, but unfortunately, it can. So most of the raids greatly welcome rogues and the only thing they need to do is casting Eviscerate once and once again. Don't get shocked when they reach 5000+dps in Sunwell Plateau bosses on lv. 70.<br />
<br />
Last, as a personal interest, I wonder if your guild name technically comes from Japanese, since it makes no sense to add &#27171; after a noun which make it mean something-like, moreover the structure &#20687;...&#27171; is more proper to get understood. While adding a &#27171; after a noun representing 'Respectful' in Japanese is widely used.(in which your guild name would be pronounced like Kami-Sama, mean (our) dear God.)<br />

To liupan: <br />
<br />
When those badly behaved kids are everywhere in your server, that's a serious problem. What I described is not just about their impatience/impoliteness/ ... etc. What I described is about a large group of China players coming to TW realms and making TW realms into their CN realms.<br />
<br />
Most Taiwanese are indeed originated from Chinese, I totally agree with that. However, Taiwan and China have been apart for 60 years. The way Taiwanese and Chinese think, speak, and act are very different now. Hence, the behaviors in game are generally very different for Taiwanese and Chinese. What I said about China players is not stereotypes, it's what native players really feel. Queuing and lagging is one problem, the changing gaming environment is another.<br />
<br />
To Pyrelight:<br />
<br />
The reason SOFTWORLD didn't ban mainland IPs is that there are many Taiwanese working in China (a lot of Taiwanese-invested companies are in China), and doing so will also ban these Taiwanese in China. And as far as I know, there are discussions about whether to ban foreign IPs or not at the very beginning of WoW franchise, I am not sure about the result, but I also have friends in Taiwan playing in US servers without any problem. If China IPs are really banned in US realms, that's the real discrimination.<br />
<br />
Actually many Taiwanese players also blame SOFTWORLD for not update / purchase new servers to maintain performance. I didn't mention it in my original post. However, the queuing / lagging problems also happened when<br />
TBC went live. TBC was also delayed in China(I remember the first version of TBC in China was 2.2). At that time SOFTWORLD did actually set up numbers of new realms to cope with China players. However, after China TBC is online, those additional server becomes &quot;ghost realms&quot;, realms with very low population and have to be merged / closed. As a result, SOFTWORLD will hesitate to do so. They did open new realms recently, but these new realms then soon filled with new China players, and the lagging still continues. Rumor has it that these new realms are believed to be set up by partition of available servers instead of new purchases.<br />
<br />
I have to admit I didn't say it clear enough in my original post. Lagging and queuing are due to multiple problems, but my conclusion seems blaming them all to China players. Taiwanese players really feel bad when seeing STARS done Heroic: Firefighter. I have to say STARS is a punching bag. I used to be a hard-core raider (I controlled blue dragons against Kil'jaeden in 2.4 :p) so I think what STARS achieved is admirable. However, the struggling situation of Taiwanese players facing should be concerned.<br />
<br />
Thank you guys for your comments.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually the reason why SOFTWORLD would not like to ban IP from Mainland China is that Chinese indeed brought lots of profits. According to some unofficial statistics, current Mainland China players exceed the local Taiwanese player to be the majority in TW Servers. And why it doesn't purchase new servers is just like what you said, afraid of the additional server becoming 'ghost servers'. It's really a contradiction which SOFTWORLD cannot solve it by its own. Only the agent in Mainland China to be stable can this problem solved.<br />
And AFAIK, due to the more and more frequent 'emergency server-down' in CN Servers(Servers are down more than 6 hours per day now) and the rumors that new agent NETEASE would have no interest to 'purchase' the game data of ex-agent THE9, which means the game data for these 4 years(CN Servers running for almost 4 years) will be lost and never be recovered again. So the immigration flow will skyrocket in upcoming weeks. Get prepared...<br />
<br />
And the reason why CN Servers is always and forever late is part out of the concern of the government which they're afraid the hypothetical 'invasion' of US culture as well as the market will be controlled by foreign entreprises(Statistics says WoW is the 1st populated online game in Mainland China). And profit sharing problem is another cause of everlasting delaying. BLZ requested approximately 50% of its profits from ex-parter THE9 for WotLK(Up from 30% when BC), which is refused by the latter. The negotiation lasts more than 3 months and finally the current agent NETEASE agreed the conditions and signed a pact with BLZ for rights of running WotLK in China. While at that time, THE9 asked the government for help for the reason 'foreign enterprises force Chinese enterprises to sign unequal pact to bring them the maximum profit' and the government actually did threatened BLZ for not approving WotLK into Mainland China if it sustain its request.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">huntress princess</div><div class="date">2009-05-17, 04:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I must agree with this completely. Blizzard has decided to ban IP addresses located in mainland China for whatever reason they have - if softworld really wishes to do so they could, and yet they did not. It is true that there are members from the mainland WoW community that does horrible things, but it is the moderator's job to filter these people out, and softworld isn't doing a thing about it.<br />
<br />
I can understand the frustration from you, but I think the frustration is slightly misplaced.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The truth is banning IP from China does little to help the situation and might even affect the legitimate user from HK and Macao. The reason is that those Chinese player from mainland are paying proxy server provider to connect to Taiwan so they don't lag. The latency is very high if they tries to connect directly. Since they are going through the proxy server and if server is located in non restricted ip area, it will not block them.<br />
<br />
The reason for all the frustration is that imagine you got home after work and you log on to TWoW, you will see you have to wait in queue to get into the server since it is so full. You wait for couple hours to finally get into the game only to find 2 things. The raid have gone without you or you don't have enough people to go on raid since most of the member are still in queue. In the worst case, some people can only log on to say good night to the guild then log off since they have been queue for 3-5 hours. Even you manage to get 25 people and raid, you will still find the server lag so badly that you cannot really enjoy unless you play pass midnight. so why would you pay for a game you can't even play every month?<br />
<br />
There's a movement now to cease playing TWoW by the Taiwanese player and trying to sue SOFTWORLD in court which both have failed so far. Since the influx of player from China mainland is way much more then the ones who quit(even all TW player quit it's still a small fraction in comparison to the ones from China) and the city government with the Consumer Protection Agency are kicking the responsibility to to each other.<br />
BLZ own shares of the SOFTWORLD so they are to blame too. Imagine if all the sudden half of the China player(half is 3M people) all the sudden jump into WoW in US or EU, what will BLZ do? then you know how we feel about the &quot;swarm&quot;.<br />
<br />
I play on PVE server which is less affected but with all the PVP server on &quot;lock down&quot;( no new account can be created on the server) it's just a matter on time before PVE server gets overwhelmed too. In fact, we recently have seen numbers of new guilds &quot;advertising&quot; on General channel that they are Chinese guilds from mainland, recruiting the mainland Chinese who came ahead of the &quot;swarm&quot;.<br />
<br />
By the way, having the same blood or having the same ancestors doesn't not mean you grow up to be the same kind of people or having the same culture. Take a look at the Singaporean, many of them have the same blood with the Chinese but are they exactly same as Chinese from mainland? and for those in US, do people always grow up to be the same from whichever the country their ancestor came from?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marculescu</div><div class="date">2009-05-17, 04:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your information of the current situation of WOW in TW region. But I'd like to further explain some details.<br />
<br />
1.language matter<br />
There're 2 types of Chinese. Traditional Chinese is commonly used in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and other South East Asian countries. And contemporary Chinese, which is more often called Simplified Chinese, uses in Mainland China, and the immigration of the majority oversea Chinese. The difference is just like Portuguese in Portugal and Latin America. Both users of traditional Chinese and contemporary Chinese can understand each other's writing and speaking very well. The only obvious differentiation is of the writing style of certain Chinese characters. This differentiation originate from 1960s when Mainland China would like to carry out a project to accumulate the literate rate, where they found one notable difficulty is because some Chinese character is too complex to write(which even you guys can easily identify &#27171; as traditional Chinese and &#26679; as contemporary Chinese), they finally simplify them and it is proven to work in the next 20 years. So generally users of contemporary Chinese have 0 problem to understand traditional Chinese, and as the users of contemporary Chinese populated all around the world, most users of traditional Chinese can understand contemporary Chinese in the communication.<br />
And the shortcut thing, I don't think there's a barrier for traditional Chinese to understand the shortcut of contemporary Chinese. The shortcut originated from the different systems of phonetic notation. For almost every Chinese character, the initial letter in both phonetic notation systems is the same. Take 'mage' as an example:<br />
&#27861;&#24107; spelled as 'Fa-Shi' in the phonetic notation system of traditional Chinese, and 'Fa Shi' in contemporary Chinese, and the shortcut 'FS' uses the initial letters, which is the same in both 2 types of Chinese. <br />
<br />
Last, as a personal interest, I wonder if your guild name technically comes from Japanese, since it makes no sense to add &#27171; after a noun which make it mean something-like, moreover the structure &#20687;...&#27171; is more proper to get understood. While adding a &#27171; after a noun representing 'Respectful' in Japanese is widely used.(in which your guild name would be pronounced like Kami-Sama, mean (our) dear God.)<br />
<br />
P.S.Excuse me for my poor English.<br />
<br />
<br />
The primary reason Taiwanese confused with contemporary chinese shortcuts is, Taiwanese doesn't use English letters in our phonetic notation system, we use Zhuyin Fuhao instead, anyone interested in this notation system can read this wikipedia article:<br />
<br />
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bopomofo<br />
<br />
Take Mage as an example, in contemporary chinese you can spell the word &quot;Fa Shi,&quot; but in Taiwan we spell the word &quot;&#12552;&#12570;&#711; &#12565;&quot; (sorry to EU/US players, you probably can not read the symbols.) When a Taiwanese sees a English shorcut, we often think of it as an English term. It sometimes lead to confusion with contemporary Chinese users, here are some examples:<br />
<br />
SS = Soulstone or Sinister Strike or Warlock (&#34899;&#22763;&#65292;Su Shi)<br />
MS = Mortal Strike or Priest (&#29287;&#24107;&#65292;Mu Shi)<br />
FB = Fireball or Instance (&#21103;&#26412;&#65292;Fu Ben)<br />
BL = Bloodlust or the Horde (&#37096;&#33853;&#65292;Bu Luo)<br />
<br />
such as these examples. These confuses Taiwanese players. Although we can still distinguish them by the situation they are used. The new Taiwanese players have problem on these terms and sometimes may be misleaded. Many Taiwanese WOW fansites prohibit use of these contemporary Chinese shortcuts since they are very confusing to Taiwanese.<br />
<br />
I guess my guild name originates from what you said, such term is quite common in Japanese TV shows I've watched or Japanese comics I've read. :p However I guess why the original founders of my guild choose this name is not affected by Japanese culture, they probably just think it's cool. ;D</div></div><hr />

---<br />
<br />
I would like to briefly introduce the current status of Taiwanese region of World of Warcraft. I'm a quitted bloodelf mage played in realm Wrathbringer-TW.<br />
<br />
There currently are 34 realms in Taiwanese(TW) region, 10 of them are PvE realms. In general, PvE realms in TW are heavily populated with alliance players, while in PvP realms player mostly choose Horde characters. In the entire TW region, Horde outnumbered Alliance with a ratio of around 55:45.<br />
<br />
TW region mainly serves players lives in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau (A Portugese colony returned to China in 1999). In Taiwan, SOFTWORLD internation is the distributer of WOW. They started a sub company to run WOW service in Taiwan, an Blizzard owns around 20%~30% of stock of this sub company, as far as I know.<br />
<br />
In TW region, most players are casual players who do battlegrounds and dailies for relax. The best progression ranks for 25-man raids are usually around world 40~70 comparing to EU/US. There were less than 10 guilds completed Naxxramas at Lv. 60 in TW region, and only 18 guilds defeated Kil'jaeden before echoes of doom went live.<br />
<br />
When WotLK went live, many Chinese players come to TW realms since the new expansion is delayed in Chinese(CN) region. The reason they choose TW realms are:<br />
1) Similar language: In Taiwan, people speak, read, and write Mandarin. The Mandarin we Taiwanese use is somehow different to what they use in China, but we can understand each other well. Most China WOW players are lack of proficiency of understanding English.<br />
2) Easier to create an account: In TW region, you don't have to bind your WOW account to a CD-KEY. The only fee payed in TW region are Game cards for extending available play time.<br />
<br />
However, the population of China WOW players is far above what TW realms can handle. Hence, after the release of WotLK, TW realms suffer from long queuing for login and serious lagging in raiding instances (especially 25-man raids). In rush hours of the game (7pm-12am in the night, and 2pm-12am in weekends), the gaminig quality is extermely bad. <br />
<br />
Many Taiwanese guilds suffer from such bad server status and being unable to progress through hard modes in Ulduar. Take my guild as an example. My guild is &#31070;&#27171; (pronounced Shen-Young, which means God-like) in Wrathbringer-TW. We downed Kil'jaeden in August 2008, and over 50 of my guild mates have completed Heroic: Glory of the Raider. 8 of them are even only two achievements away from Glory of Ulduar Raider (Only Orbit-uary and Firefighter left, they completed One Light in the Darkness top-30 worldwide). But my guild can't even do Heroic: Lose Your Illusion since Thorim charges from four torrents simultaneously while lagging. Not to mention other hard modes of keepers.<br />
<br />
Even STARS and The 7 (another top China guild reroll in TW, they downed KJ among top 10 worldwide as far as I remember) suffer from such lagging situations. They have to raid during midnight to avoid the lags. The first kills of Yogg-Saron for them are at around 4am in the morning.<br />
<br />
The SOFTWORLD International decided not to perchase new equipments to solve this problem, since most China players definitely will return to CN region when their WotLK goes live. However, the specific time for China WotLK goes live is not sure by now, since the distributor of WOW in China will change from 9th city to Netease in June.<br />
<br />
Moreover, China players don't under the concept of &quot;While in Rome, do as the romans do.&quot; For players in US realms, if you see someone spamming in General/Trade/LFG channels, that guy is very likely a China player. They used to do so in China realms. Imagine a lot of such China players in your realm, that's really big problem.<br />
<br />
Moreover, the way China players communicate in games are somehow unacceptable for Taiwanese players. In CN region, the fee is counted in minutes players played. As a result, many China players appeared very impatient while communicating with others. This is not tolerable for most Taiwanese players.<br />
<br />
Also they use strange spelling words to communicate in games since that's the way they teach Mandarin pronunciation in China (in Taiwan, a specific phonetic notation system is used). For example, Mage in Chinese is &#27861;&#24107; (pronounced Fa-Shi), and China players call mages FS, which is not understandable for Taiwanese players. The way chinese players post in LFG channel can be seem like this:<br />
<br />
[LFG]: H FL -4 FS MS DZ SS (Heroic Mana Tombs, look for 4 more, mage, priest, rogue and warlock.)<br />
<br />
Taiwanese players can't understand this easily (I believe EU/US players are even more confused about such message), and such messages even confuse new Taiwanese players, which leads to bad understanding to the game. I've heard someone insists that Zul'Farrak = ZR, which doesn't make sense at all.<br />
<br />
Not every China players are badly behaved in TW realms. I have met many great China players who follow what Taiwanese players do in TW realms and we all had a great time running through dungeons. However, other new-coming China players who does not understand the culture of TW realms severely destroyed gaming experience of we Taiwanese players.<br />
<br />
In fact, seeing STARS achieved Heroic: Firefighter, most domestic Taiwanese players only feel angry and unforgiving against STARS instead of trying to congratulate them, since China players severely destroyed the gaming environment Taiwanese players used to have.<br />
<br />
Although the title of this news says &quot;Stars (Taiwan) beats Mimiron in Hard Mode&quot;, very few Taiwanese players will be proud of them since the success of STARS is on the basis of 200,000 struggled Taiwanese players, I have to say this.<br />
<br />
p.s. Sorry for bad English :p<br />
<br />
<br />

We thought the engineering problem was worse because players felt compelled to drop their current profession and grind out engineering just for PvP. While that does happen in extreme cases to races too, you give up so much progress on your current character to reroll that the racial has to be quite overpowered to make that trade worth it. It's a bigger concern on something like the tournament realms where players can change their race easily.<br />
<br />
Like I said though, we did a lot of work on racials for 3.0, but that doesn't mean they are completely finished and polished as a feature.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Did they not see this coming? 90% of all good arena rogues wear goggles to out play the enemy rogues, or druids or have a chance against non-engineer human rogues (if any exist). Such a dumb idea. Just remove the perception so the rest of us Dwarves, Nelfs, Belfs, Gnomes, Undead, Orcs, Trolls can be happy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I have been playing WoW since beta, and when it launched my first toon was on one of the most populated realms (Mannoroth, where vodka originally formed), and I once had a queue of over 2k people. I can definitely feel your pain there. It is indeed very frustrating to come home with high hopes of doing something in WoW then spend the whole night waiting. <br />
<br />
Still, I think it's unfair to blame the mainland players for the situation. If I was playing on mainland servers and all of a sudden the distributor stops all updates on new game content, I'd wish to go to TW servers as well... wouldn't you? Obviously I will try to show the best side when I get there, which I agree many people may not be attempting, but that is a matter that can only be solved through other means such as in-game enforcement of a strict code of conduct, but whether that is necessary is another debate.<br />
<br />
As for IP banning, I didn't think of the proxy servers so thanks for the heads up. However, there are many other ways to curb the &quot;swarm&quot;: one example would be that people cannot register accounts on US realms without a valid NA address/postal code. Certainly there are ways to get around it, but it will create barriers that make it not worthwhile for many. In the end, to say &quot;we don't welcome you so stop coming&quot; is not going to work, and it is SOFTWORLD's job to decide if they would like to go the extra length to protect the locality of the gaming environment for local players.<br />
<br />

I don't know if you bother to read ngacn or duowan (2 of the biggest WoW-related forums in mainland China), but if you do you will see new posts everyday in which OPs urge new &quot;immigrants&quot; to behave &quot;as Romans&quot;. There is an effort from a big portion of the players to preserve the in-game environment on TW servers, but given the magnitude of the influx, even a small fraction of a large base number will wreak enough havoc to destroy the gaming experience for many.<br />
<br />
On a side note, &#31070;&#27171; in Japanese (pronounced as Kami-Sama) simply means God, with the &#27171; being a term of reverence used in conjunction with other entities such as father, mother, etc as well. In Chinese, &#31070;&#27171; sort of means &quot;God-like&quot;. Maybe it's because of that that your guild chose the name?</div></div><hr />

<br />

&quot;STSM -1 FS...mmmmm&quot; -&gt; (The first thing sucks)<br />
After &quot;2&quot; seconds, you could reads this from the same player again...<br />
Do you have any reason to behave just like barbarian and post you messages each 2 seconds???<br />
If you tell these guys to behave well,<br />
they always reply:&quot;Taiwanese sucks, I've paid, why can't I post my messages at my will???&quot;<br />
<br />
Could CN players be more civilized and Communicable?<br />
<br />
<br />
Most players &quot;Do Not&quot; care which guild loot hard mode from any bosses.<br />
It's impossible for any Guild to do so in a 3000ms latency web environment.<br />
My CoA, Corruption causes 3~4s to cast and SB causes even 10s to cast,<br />
<br />
Imagine that:<br />
If TW players organize TW Guild in EU/US server,<br />
Just said Chinese like &quot;&#22887;&#26460;&#20126;10&#20154;&#24501;&#19968;&#35036;&quot; in global channel.<br />
Crowd in and cause the latency up to 5000ms.<br />
And post the announcement about the World First Down of some boss,<br />
Could any EU/US players be happy about this???<br />

The players have a responsibility to observe in-game rules and conventions, but ultimately it is SOFTSTAR's decision to allow mainland players to &quot;swarm&quot; TW servers that caused your frustration. You may very well vent your anger at the mainland players, but in reality they haven't done anything wrong - the game is available and they want to play it - and guess what, they can.<br />
<br />
I really have no defense when it comes to players lacking general sense of respect however, I have seen my share of rudeness and incivility when I was playing on the CN realms. Report and have them banned without mercy, if that does any good.</div></div><hr />

The kill pushed them crying here,crying everywhere,their environment destroyed. <br />

ps:stars got Ulduar 8days later than EU/US<br />
<br />
<br />
They didn't get much of a head-start; (in my experience, US server) Ulduar stability was a laughing stock when it first came out... if you were &quot;lucky&quot; enough to get an instance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If you think that Ulduar is somehow more stable on TW servers, you can think again. STARS have been reportedly starting raids at around 1 am to avoid lagging, and even then some members get 400-500 ms latency.<br />
<br />
Do you know how pugs are advertised there? They don't say &quot;we have great players&quot;, they say &quot;we have successfully created the instance&quot;, because the instance servers are so crowded that many people cannot even zone in at instance door due to failure to create new instances.</div></div><hr />

There're two great Shm in my guild as well. Both of them are Chinese.<br />
<br />
However, Just imagine about how recent tide of bugs are annoying:<br />
They never thinks about what they've done to others. (Their OS: Because this is my homeland, I'll do anything I want)<br />
Except what I've mentioned...<br />
Moreover, they often brings stupid issues and behaviors into TW server.<br />
Such as: Taiwan is part of China. I'll play what I do. I'm boss. &#26085;(Fuck-off)<br />
<br />
Some people thinks all the responsibility is on Softstar.<br />
Actually, Softstar suck!<br />
But do I have any reason to suffer loss due to stupid CN agent?<br />
If CN environment is SO great as you claimed?<br />
If CN players are SO great as you claimed?<br />
Why not got back to your CN sever and enjoy you own TBC wonderland?<br />
Why not leave a clean environment?<br />
<br />
Previous Hong-Kong players are gentleman and behave well. But CN players are on opposite way, however.<br />
DO CN players ever think about the old joke in park announcement of Chinese and dogs?<br />
Why always CN players are NOT welcome? Why JP, Hong Kong and etc are generally acceptable?<br />
DO they ever think about themselves?</div></div><hr />

<br />
can you tell me the reason why you complained after the kill,not before the kill here?<br />
<br />
did you want to show jokes to the non-asia players?<br />
<br />
The guys outside asia did not care the location of china-mainland,taiwan,korea and anywhere else.<br />
<br />
Your crying here was not able to change the situation.<br />
<br />
You can make topics at Blizzard forum not here.<br />
<br />
stop the stupid action(or a drama).<br />
<br />
it's a topic about mimiron hardmode kill.</div></div><hr />

I'll say this again. It is SOFTSTAR's, and SOFTSTAR's fault alone that you are getting into those long queues. It is partially the immigrant players' fault that you feel your gaming experience has deteriorated. It is unfair to stereotype all CN players as &quot;bad&quot;. There are baddies everywhere, and that includes TW players.<br />
<br />
Anyway, this thread has been derailed since Marculescu posted. I posted after seeing many people expressing interest in the situation, but this has seemingly brought what used to be a Mimiron hardmode kill thread into a TW rage vent. <br />
<br />
This will be the last time I post in this thread.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well Said. Marculescu or whoever feels the need to vent your frustration or hatred about Chinese players, please create a separate thread. This is a Mimiron hard mode kill post in case you haven't noticed .</div></div><hr />

<br />
NAZI? haha~<br />
We always welcome well-educated HK players though<br />
We will remember your opinion about this,<br />
And persuade all China players to post their Stupid-Spell sentence on all global channels in US/EU server. I hope you will be “VERY” pleased to see all these rude manners. Please MUST show your joyfulness then.<br />
Eg: Seek for “enchant” -&gt; “FM” -&gt; &#12551;&#12552;<br />
<br />
As someone may say why complain here and now?<br />
It’s all coincident that Blizzard terminate CN server, Nothing concerned with TW server but just sacrifice.<br />
You say why CN Guild could do so?<br />
For most original players are only available between PM8:00~PM12:00.<br />
TW players would not share single account and schedule due time. All members are required in REAL LIFE. <br />
CN players rushed in. Schedule players and share single account, and keep POLLUTING server environment (Noise &amp; dirty words, Real-Gold-Trade, Account-Trade)<br />
Well, Well, Well, It’s FAIR start-point?<br />
<br />
Finally,<br />
It’s also my late post here, And sorry for all US/EU players,<br />
<br />
For CN players,<br />
Please just see how your NGA treats these barbarian manners:<br />
They are just TYPICAL CN players’ style in TW server.<br />
