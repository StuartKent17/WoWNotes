Alterac Valley Improvements<br />
Alterac Valley will see a few very significant improvements in the next patch and we wanted to share the details of what we have planned.<br />
<br />
The first change will be to move the Horde's starting tunnel back to a more equal distance from the first objectives, which will help evenly distance the starting points for each side across the terrain when the battle commences.<br />
<br />
In addition, the General and Warmasters for each faction will receive a stacking buff from each other that boosts their health and damage. The more of them that are still in the battleground, the more dangerous they will all be. This will put a greater focus on destroying (and defending!) the towers that remove the Warmasters as players work toward defeating the appropriate General and conquering the land.<br />
<br />
Also Balinda Stonehearth has been studying her spellbooks to become a more challenging opponent to the Horde and will do more damage with her spells. The additional health we recently added to Balinda and General Vanndar Stormpike will no longer be needed with these improvements and will be changed back to their previous amounts with the patch.<br />
<br />
With these improvements teamwork and strategy will be more important than ever from beginning to end as the Alliance and Horde battle for victory in Alterac Valley. We'll see you on the battlefield.</div></div><hr />

They're going to make it more difficult for horde to win, when the alliance already run straight through and can leap over everything? <br />

Can we have a snow storm so we can climb up the mountain behind the south bunker without going over the bridge? Can we maybe get some archers worth a damn in our towers? ugh. <br />

Horde dont need to kill a shit they just need to position themself correctly. The only way alliance can use the archers to their advantage is by actually defending the towers, a tactic which in fact is also usable by horde.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not correct. The south dun bunker isn't cap'able by horde without killing 1 of the NPC's, something that takes up very valuable time. Also, when horde runs in to the alliance base, they get hit by all the archers, while alliance can just easily run in to the horde base without taking much damage at all, without aggroing any NPC's, and just cap everything. Ever seen an AV(40vs40) where horde cap'ed the alliance base before alliance cap'ed horde? No? Didn't think so.<br />
<br />
In my battlegroup horde wins maby 15-20% of the AV's (rough estimate after grinding over 250k honor for a newly dinged 70 alt).</div></div><hr />

It is for a rogue, all you gotta do is Sap that archer and then you can cap it np, I've done it numerous of times. The real tactic is to have rogues rush DB bunkers and defend them :)</div></div><hr />

So you are being a faction biased child then I presume?<br />
<br />
Game content hasn't changed, its still PvE and PvP (sadly its leaning more towards PvP nowadays, but it hasn't changed)<br />
<br />
They didn't do this because of whining, they are literally trying to balance things out, I say give them another patch or two and see what happens 2.4 hasn't come out yet and it won't be without extensive testing, so stop whining and start posting and giving feedback instead of &quot;OMG ALLIANCE QQ LAWL PVE NEWBS&quot;, that bullshit is really getting on my nerves.<br />
<br />
In all actuality in my battlegroup Alliance don't even play AV outside of premades anymore because of the sheer amount of stupidity in it, but a lot of Horde players are the same way as well, stupidity is all around in this game, not focused in one faction, from my experiences to 70 on both factions, 2 servers each, both sides are equally moronic.<br />

<br />
<br />
Wrong. Both bunkers are easily capped with correct positioning. Rogues and druids can accomplish this with ease - I have done so myself.<br />
<br />
Horde have a large tower advantage in that they can easily stealth up into the bunker and cap it without putting the archers into combat - at which point the archers despawn. It's practically impossible for alliance to duplicate this feat due to archer placement. The only reason that alliance caps the base towers first is because of how many horde defend the base - an average of zero per match in the Cyclone group.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, when horde runs in to the alliance base, they get hit by all the archers, while alliance can just easily run in to the horde base without taking much damage at all, without aggroing any NPC's, and just cap everything.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also wrong; someone will aggro multiple NPCs on the way into the base. However on Alliance, it's easy to mitigate the damage by sending in a warrior in def stance into the base first. And while it is definitely easier for alliance to break combat by riding back behind the keep, that wasn't your complaint.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ever seen an AV(40vs40) where horde cap'ed the alliance base before alliance cap'ed horde? No? Didn't think so.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes. Non-retarded horde can do this easily, and in Cyclone those are the matches that horde win. YMMV.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In my battlegroup horde wins maby 15-20% of the AV's.<br />
<br />
<br />
Are you in Cyclone or Ruin? Otherwise your experience in seeing alliance win most matches is a fluke. The fact is that in 80% of the battlegroups, horde win 75% of AVs.<br />
<br />
I've played both factions in Cyclone and horde in AV are as juvenile, argumentative, and uncooperative in AV - and only in AV - as alliance are in all three other BGs. If you want to get your faction winning, lead instead of bitch, and teach instead of misinform (which is what you attempted in this post).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Make the whole thing friggin symmetrical. Exact same distances for bunkers, towers, faction start points, exact same hp and positioning of archers etc.<br />
<br />
It'll be lame because it will just be a mirror map like all other bg's, but who gives a crap. Making NPC's stronger, moving the starting tunnel etc are just putting a bandaid on a much bigger wound.<br />
<br />
All this 'tweaking' they've done to AV is just rubbish and a waste of time. It won't ever be balanced until it's a mirror map.</div></div><hr />

I like the symmetrical idea, but it just loses so much love at the same time, I'd miss the look of it.<br />

I say just give us old AV back and reward marks for graveyard/tower caps, and then 3 marks to everyone if Drek/Van dies and 1 to everyone if Balinda/Galv die.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PvP in this game is not based around backwater battlegroups such as BG1 and crap. It is based around top pvp battlegroups such as BG8 and BG9 where servers have been here since the dawn of WoW and people actually brings real pvp gears to the fight, where top arena teams from here do actually graduate into tournaments. Try fighting there in newbie blue gear. You be picked aprt and killed in seconds after you see the enemy.<br />
<br />
You can't talk about balance when most of people in the BG has not even reach the pinnacle of gears yet. You can't tell the difference of which side is good, which side is bad and which side is disadvantaged until most people that you are fighting has as good pvp gear as yourself.</div></div><hr />

If you run into the red portal instead of playing you also lose, lets not discuss balance based on skill, right? An alliance CAN and should avoid all NPC's in the Frostwolf base, anyone short of platewearers WILL die on their way into the alliance base because of said archers.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes. Non-retarded horde can do this easily, and in Cyclone those are the matches that horde win. YMMV.<br />
<br />
Are you in Cyclone or Ruin? Otherwise your experience in seeing alliance win most matches is a fluke. The fact is that in 80% of the battlegroups, horde win 75% of AVs.<br />
<br />
I've played both factions in Cyclone and horde in AV are as juvenile, argumentative, and uncooperative in AV - and only in AV - as alliance are in all three other BGs. If you want to get your faction winning, lead instead of bitch, and teach instead of misinform (which is what you attempted in this post).<br />
<br />
<br />
Again don't use skill as an argument towards balance, skill is supposed to be what wins or loses a fight, not the geometry or anything else, if a less-skilled group can win against a team with more skills then that is proof that balance itself is skewed. Someone earlier mentioned AB/WSG/EOTS, and oddly enough on my battlegroup i've won atleast 70% of my BG's there, and oddly enough there are no npc's, no different terrain from one eachother to the point that it gives an tactical advantage.<br />
<br />
But oddly enough we can win the matches where skill is the only factor.<br />
<br />
This discussion is obviously never gonna end, but i hop there's something anyone can agree to, and that is that AV does need a redesign, and not only on the terrain sides of the matter, but also the base design, the npc design, perhaps even the objective needs to be redesigned.<br />
<br />
Perhaps Blizzard shouldn't focus as much on the player interaction and make it more like DotA.</div></div><hr />

Today was an exaption it seems, we won 3 games in a row in the afternoon!<br />
But then the Real-Horde came online, and we where doomed to loose :D<br />
<br />
Well, it's definately the lack of skill on our side that makes us loose.<br />
But there are some disadvantages to both sides that make it difficult in different ways for both sides.<br />
<br />
A symetrical map requires more of a map change than to reposition the tunnel of the Horde. But it only might change something. Skill won't pop out of nothing on our side ^^<br />
The idea of rewarding players that stay behind of the zerg and defend towers&amp;graveyards (like an +Honor/Dmg/whatever-aura at those points) might make it interessting for our side to actually take part in strategic playing, instead of running around alone and trying to get some kills or sth...<br />

<br />
I sure as hell know I'd play a mature battlegroup over the ones we have now, then I could at least count on the people I play with instead of assuming they are all 8 year old kids &lt;.&lt; (Insert lots of expletives about Night Elf Hunters filling up AV that don't even have a clue how to play their class)</div></div><hr />

Each time you accept an AV queue you don't know if you will be playing from the horde side of the map or the alliance side of the map. Horde could no longer cry about alliance bunkers and archers or the bridge and alliance wouldn't be able to complain about IBGY or anything else. I can't think of any better way to even out the map besides making it a mirror image and that just isn't any fun. Would all the qq stop? Probably not but each faction, horde and alliance, would get equal opportunity to discover the bonuses and flaws of playing from each side of the map and an equal opportunity to take advantage of and fall prey to said flaws and bonuses.</div></div><hr />
