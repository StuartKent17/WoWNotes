For a preview of what to expect, see our previous Theramore coverage: Partial run of Theramore Scenario (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDiwlp2wgOg), Theramore Screenshots and Scenario Steps (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2780-Pandaren-Male-Emote-Sounds-Theramore-Scenario-Preview-Blue-Posts-The-Daily-Blink), Horde Theramore Dialogue (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSy6KBPvzKQ), Jaina Theramore Dialogue (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JinS53T2kc), Theramore Quests (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2727-Jewelcrafting-Panther-Preview-Theramore-Scenario-Mists-of-Pandaria-Quests), and Very Early Map Preview (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0xbsA6upiA).<br />
<br />
The Battle of Theramore, the first of many Scenarios coming to World of Warcraft, is a story-changing event that will be available to level-85 characters for one week only -- the week leading up to the launch of Mists of Pandaria on September 25.<br />
<br />
For the duration of the week of September 18-24, level-85 characters will be able to queue up for and participate in the Alliance and Horde versions of this new Scenario with two friends. (Please note: if friends are not available to you at the time, two will be provided. Batteries not included. Subject to change. Void where prohibited.)<br />
<br />
After the lifting of the mists, the Battle of Theramore will join all other Scenarios as level-90-only content, and everyone -- including players who missed it at level 85 -- will be able to play through the event. Upon completing the Scenario for the first time, players will see the aftermath of the battle whenever visiting Theramore in Dustwallow Marsh. Theramore will eventually be changed permanently to its post-battle state in a future patch, sometime after the launch of Mists of Pandaria, whether or not players have completed the Scenario.<br />
<br />
We’ll see you there!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Though I will say this, the fact that this thereamore thing is going to be available again at 90 is somewhat upsetting. My excitement for it has been hurt a little bit. IT should still be fun to do regardless though.</div></div><hr />

They're trying something a little different with this pre-expac event and allowing players to see it over and over again if they choose via the scenario feature. Seems like a great idea to me, especially if the scenario is as fun as some of the previous pre-expac events. <br />
<br />
And also, world changing events of certain areas where terrain and places are forever changed is a GREAT idea I have been wanting for a long time. It makes the world seem completely dynamic and ever evolving instead of the same exact place for an ENTIRE xpac no matter what quests and events you complete. I love it.</div></div><hr />

I am still hoping that Blizzard is holding a surprise for all of us. That suddenly this whole world event that was never talked about comes out of left field and has nothing to do with Theramore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why would there be a whole world event for something that doesn't affect the world? The Battle for Theramore is the starting point for the new faction war that is supposed to start heating up in MoP so it makes sense that there is only one event. Of course, that makes too much sense so everybody please carry on with your idiotic complaints.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">itomeshi</div><div class="date">2012-08-28, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a lot of hate going on here. Let's break some of these down:<br />
<br />
&quot;You can do it again at 90!&quot;<br />
Good! One thing I've been bummed about for a while is the removal of the post-Wrathgate sacking of Undercity. It was a cool event, gave us a bit of character development for Jaina (that is especially important for this event), and removing it eliminated a chunk of story.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is all they're doing!&quot;<br />
Funny, I don't think this event has been on the PTR or beta realms. We only know the barest outline so far - &quot;Garrosh destroys Theramore; Jaina distraught; More at 11.&quot; And if they're building better event infrastructure with scenarios? I'll take it! We've seen that dungeons can consist of multiple world zones (Dragon Soul is in Dragonblight, the Maelstrom, a boat above the sea, and the Eye of Eternity). What's to say the scenario can't be as well? A (hopefully skippable) event in the capital talking to faction leaders? Always possible. Additional skirmishes in other locations? Also possible. We don't know jack yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are the cool items?&quot;<br />
I don't know. We'll find out on... September 18th! I'm willing to bet Blizzard isn't playing their whole hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want a special item to show I participated that you can't get later!&quot;<br />
Cool. I hope no one has other commitments during that one week. If work picks up for me, I might lose out. Now, I mean, I'd be OK if it took more work later to get the rewards, but you don't need a gold star for perfect attendance.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is just a preview of a dungeon we'll get at 90!&quot;<br />
No, this is the initial launch of an event that we'll still be able to access later (again, in case real life exists). This is not a war crime - those are Garrosh's territory. :)<br />
<br />
&quot;Blizzard is trolling us with a comment about friends!&quot;<br />
No. They're making a joke. I'm sure, if you want, we can have Activision or EA step in and give us wholly sanitized comments without any personality whatsoever. Here, I'll show you: &quot;New feature: You can queue for this event with up to three people, and if you queue with less, you'll be matched with other players.&quot; That was better, right?<br />
<br />
I'm not arguing that this event is better than others, or worse, or anything. I just get annoyed when people complain about things that they don't know about yet. If the event really is completely boring and pointless? BY ALL MEANS, let's discuss that. On September 19th (after at least a day to digest it)! The argument that the amount of content Blizzard is producing is a valid one at some level - but by the same token, things like significantly higher res art take much more time. Voice acting takes longer than writing speech bubbles. Interactive events require all new systems development.<br />
<br />
Please, just take a deep breath - and let's see what they come up with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is.<br />

Killing Demons in front of a portal was fun? For a tabard?<br />
<br />
Tons of people complained about the griefing during the zombie invasion event. <br />
<br />
People complained about the inconvenience of the Cataclysm event and rehashed bosses, and the impossibility of completing it on a low-population server.<br />
<br />
A shame they killed WoW three times, wasn't it?</div></div><hr />

That is pretty sucky.<br />
<br />
<br />
Look back to Cataclysm, and you had a massive world event taking place that set the scene, Wrath of the Lich King had the epic zombie invasion, which really did spread throughout the cities and turn them into horrible zombie infested places of awesomeness (or not depending on how you look at it!), we fought hordes of undead in the plaguelands for the argent dawn/crusade, we fought a new boss in Karazhan.<br />
<br />
<br />
And for MOP we get to do an instance 1 week early, oh goodie.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard sure knows how to dampen the enthusiasm of those who were going to come back to the game a little early, might aswel wait until MOP is released now.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tumaras</div><div class="date">2012-08-28, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unless there is more to the story that they haven't let out yet this is pretty disappointing. Blizzard took out one of the scenarios that were coming in the mop anyway, scaled it down 5 levels, and just released it a week early rather than creating event content. Might as well have scaled down Lost City of Tol'vir and done the same thing for cata and called it the pre-event. <br />
<br />
On top of it all, you can do the scenario at 90 anytime anyway. This 'event' is just a 1 week early preview of 1 scenario. Yay. It's probably not enough money to be worth the hassle, but in my college days I'd have cancelled for the next month and saved $15. Maybe that's why they didn't release this news until now when it's less than a month until mop... <br />
<br />
Call it whining, but Blizz has stated Thermore IS the mop pre-event - not just part of it. Some of the replies here are just downplaying the past events to brush off how disappointing this is. Feel free to lookup how much content there actually was to those events if you don't recall, compared to what appears to be essentially zero extra event content for mop. Also, hoping that Blizzard has a big secret stash of additional event content waiting in the bag to surprise everyone with is probably grasping at straws tbh.</div></div><hr />

Really not any different then the troll or gnome event pre-Cata. And let's face it, the elemental event was piss poor, so I'm not even counting that as pre-Cata, especially considering how good the Pre-BC and Pre-Wrath events were.</div></div><hr />

In a month we'll be getting a whole new continent to explore, a new class and race, more dungeons and raids, scenarios, pet battles, challenge modes, quests etc etc. Even now we'll be getting AoE looting, new talent system, account wide mounts, achievements, pets. I would much rather have those things than some temporary event that I will complete once and then totally forget about.<br />
So I suggest you whiners sit tight and just wait another month until the new expac is released.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Devs ´hey, we want to spend a few weeks working on the pre-mop event´.<br />
Bean counters ´ you mean, all those man-hours for something that lasts a couple weeks?<br />
Bean counters ´don´t you wish you had spent the man-hours you spent on cata-prelaunch on things for players to do at level 85'... <br />
Devs ´good point.<br />
<br />
This is a good compromise, it is a prelaunch event, and content for players at 90.<br />
<br />
Remember, the excuse given by GC on why we don´t see class quests is that they can´t justify spending man-hours on content that only 1/11th of the players will participate in.<br />
<br />
My guess is they just didn´t want to devote a lot of dev time for something that is one-shot content.</div></div><hr />

For Firelands they gave us 7 days game time. Same thing with Dragon Soul. I think they are going to give us another 7 days again since it's a major Patch. And 10 more days after MoP is out since they always give trials.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's silly. Content is king. The removal of content detracts from the cumulative value of WoW. Now, certainly, some things - the zombie event, Hakkar's spreading DoT (which I never got to experience, sadly), etc. - can not be recreated or maintained, because it is the social aspect that gives them half of their value. But - and this is a big BUT - there is little reason to eliminate most content. <br />
<br />
For example, as I previously mentioned, the post-Wrathgate Siege of Undercity was an awesome event. It tied up the post-cinematic state nicely, gave us a tiny bit of character development between Jaina and Varian, and had a truly epic feel. It wasn't perfect, but it was really a stand-out event in my mind. Fast-forward to when I convince my girlfriend to play WoW, and how abruptly that story ends - she now misses out on a huge event.<br />
<br />
Realize that all content takes time to make. They have to look at the Return-on-Investment for content. If they make an event that requires 100 man-weeks to produce (25 people for 1 month - honestly a bit conservative IMHO) - and then it's only available for 1-2 weeks? That is a hard expense to justify in the face of other demands. Make it available long term, and you can introduce your friends who missed that content to big story arcs.<br />
<br />
Finally, let me mention your counter-attitude for a second. WoW is now almost 8 years old, and time is more precious now. As an example: if you started playing at 16, when you may have had tons of free time to commit to the game, you are now 24 - and may not due to college/work/family concerns. From my own experience, I've missed half of an event in the past due to work, and if work picks up for me September 17th? Well, I guess I wouldn't get to see the event. Am I ENTITLED to it? Not really - I suppose at some level I slightly am, due to paying for it, but that's not Blizzard's fault. However, letting me see and do it later? That means quite a bit to me and others like me. So perhaps you should try to consider that perhaps you don't have the only opinion that matters here.<br />
<br />
And before you say I'm a noob: I've played since early BC. I've raided in nearly every tier since Karazhan, among the other things I've done in the game. I play most days. I know that before I started, things were far different. I've seen the changes that have happened since I joined. Many are good - I don't miss managing ammo on my hunter alt, I like that my main is actually viable in all of it's specs at some level, I don't miss having to sit in trade for hours to find a dungeon group, etc. Some are not as good - removal of class quests, over-homogenization between classes, the nerfs to abilities that were fun in PVE because they can't be balanced in PVP, etc. Before you bash me, or someone else, or Blizzard (who isn't perfect but largely does try and succeed), take a look at the big picture. And if you have resort to attacking a person instead of their ideas? Perhaps you should not respond and not prove how foolish and disrespectful you are.</div></div><hr />

Wow you quoted me verbatim... no wait you are putting words in my mouth. Events are limited time things, a scenario isn't, they shouldn't be calling this a world event that is my problem.

A better idea I feel is that the world events should happen annually during the course of the expansion around the same date as the launch until the last patch of the expansion, a scenario being label as an event cheapen both events and what they want scenarios to be.</div></div><hr />

But that's just it. The importan thing after your first born is born to look after it, raise him/her and make them a decent human being but that's just it.

What is this? A political arguement? What, are you going to start a riot on the streets now? It's just a game FFS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Imagine they had the Glastonbury musical event as a pre-recorded show that you turn up and watch anytime you wanted, so that more people could see it, instead of making it an absolutely massive historic live event that people might still be talking about for years to come. The reason world events were amazing were because they changed the actual world in real time, and players could take part and interact in the storyline that lead up to the expansion. You become part of it as it happens, a dynamic world event that evolves and only happens over a short period of time (a few weeks).<br />
<br />
The whole point that makes it great is that it is a large scale &quot;world&quot; event that people can say &quot;i was part of&quot; and remember fondly when talking about the game, things like the zombie invasion that could never work on a longterm scale but worked amazingly well in the short term of the event, to really bring forward the reality of the expansion pack.<br />

Blizzard are just taking one more step into allowing themselves to halfass everything. Make it fast, cheap and maximise profits.</div></div><hr />

I loved the previous 2 events, this isnt an event though, instead you get to do an instance a week early, think that is the point. A lot of people loved the last 2 events too, there isn't an event for people to hate/love for MOP.</div></div><hr />

Kinda lame that something that is supposed to be exclusive to players who play the game at that time becomes just available to everyone.</div></div><hr />
