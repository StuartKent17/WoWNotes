... How would you expect it to move? By the way, if you didnt buy it, you were not ripped off.<br />
<br />
Now, if you bought it, and found out that it did not fly, that would be a rip.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc657df7e136</div><div class="date">2011-04-02, 07:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would really like the winged guardian, but I'm waiting to see how popular it is. I remember I almost bought the celestial steed on the day it came out and before I logged in. I couldn't find my card or something so I logged in anyway and saw one. Then another. Then another three. Then realised Dalarn was crawling with them. So was Org. And all the leveling areas. Now I'm glad I didn't get one.<br />
<br />
I know some people get all huffy about people who say this - the whole &quot;If you like a mount it shouldn't matter how many other people have it&quot; arguement. But part of the appeal of these mount is that they &quot;look awesome&quot;. Things lose the ability to &quot;look awesome&quot; when they are very commonplace - people were awestruck by the cinema, TV sets, washing machines and, more recently. 3D movies. People would gather round rich peoples' windows and peer in at TV sets when they first came out because they were so amazing. Now they are so common place that we give a new TV set about as much admiration as we might give a new coat or a new pair of socks. Same thing with the celestial steed and, I suspect, with this mount. It looks amazing in this vid - flying solo through SW, but if that video was the thing flying through SW and passing by about 30-40 other people on identical mounts it would suddenly look a bit ridiculous.<br />
<br />
So I'll probably pass - and if you buy it, more power to you. Maybe you are a bit less shallow than me. Or maybe a bit more, I'm not sure.<br />
<br />
I just wish they would make a new new set of mounts that were cool and that I could work for on my own. My guild is kinda crap at killing final bosses in raid tiers and my ability to make gold is pathetic - and I'm getting bored of my netherdrakes.</div></div><hr />

I am really impressed. I assumed it's flying animations would be awkward to look at, but it turned out amazing. I really like the flying idle animation it has where it looks around at the ground. Whether or not everyone and their mum has this mount, I must have it. To me, if I like the mount, why not use it? I might love the thrill of hunting for rare mounts but this is only because rare mounts tend to be the best looking. I like mounts if they look good to me, not judging by how many people have them. <br />

<br />
Who knows? Thing with the Sparkle Pony was that soon after it became available it was the centre of attention in alot of Machinima's about it being made of the tears of noobs and shizzle, not to mention how barbie-like it looks. This, however, is a whole new level of extreme awesomeness. I doubt that we won't see many of these being ridden over time. <br />
And to the people that complain again about it being a store mount and it using existing models: DOUBLE FACEPALM. People are hard to satisfy these days. Just because it has a unique look doesn't mean it has to come from a top notch encounter. We raiders will be rewarded soon enough with the Beryl Firehawks. Let others have something cool to play with aswell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually it's mostly See: Hippogriff. That's where the two got most of their mount animation. IE the frame/flight animation and think the /mountspecial command animation. So Sparklepony took nothing away from Invincible.<br />
<br />
So hey, my griff was ripped off! QQQQQ.<br />
<br />
Sarcastic qq aside, that mount is god damn beautiful. And, it doesn't sparkle. Meaning my manly characters [mostly orcs lol] don't have to sit on a pos wyvern or a sparkle horse! And now my lowbie toons have two flying mounts to switch between now, huzzah.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Things lose the ability to &quot;look awesome&quot; when they are very commonplace <br />
<br />
<br />
Lemme guess. You don't use nether drakes anymore because everyone has them? You don't use Protos anymore because everyone has atleast one version? You don't use Nether rays anymore because everyone has them? You don't use a dragonhawk/hppogriff because everyone has one? You don't use land mounts because my god, everyone has one! And oh, you can't use frostwyrms because everyone has those! I bet you don't use the festival mounts because again my god, everyone has them!!! So what must you ride? The pimp rocket from Love is in the air!<br />
<br />
But oh I forget, that rocket only exists like about 1/2 a server!<br />
<br />
So what do you ride sir that 'looks awesome' yet, is not commonplace?<br />
<br />
<br />
flying solo through SW, but if that video was the thing flying through SW and passing by about 30-40 other people on identical mounts it would suddenly look a bit ridiculous.<br />

If you had read my post properly rather than just seeing something that might disagree with your views and then spewing off on a semi-rant that made very little sense, you would have seen that I said at the end that I'm getting bored of my netherdrakes . Meaning I mainly ride those (also you would have seen that I wasn't QQing as you seem to imply with the tone of your post - I have no objection to the mount, or it's presence on the Blizzard store, I was just expressing my view on it and why I wouldn't be getting it). Fyi, other characters either ride class-based mounts (eg. DK, druid flight form), profession mounts (flying carpets, gyrocopters) or the standard faction mounts - although I've grinded up Netherwing on two different toons now.<br />
<br />
I didn't say anywhere that I needed to have some kind of completely rare and almost unatttainable mount to enjoy it - just that the sheer volume of the Celestial Steeds that appeared made it seem ridiculous to me to be riding one. Nowhere near as many people ride any of the mounts you mentioned as there were people with the celestial steed when it came out. I think that these mounts also suffer from their &quot;awesome factor&quot; - that seeing so many people riding around on horses or even griffons / windriders doesn't seem so bad because it's kind of believable in the context of the world. But these very flashy mounts suddenly popping up everywhere does seem a bit silly and they really stand out because of their lighting effects and glows etc.<br />
<br />
I have no objection to Blizzard releasing mounts in the store. Although I think that they are going about it the wrong way. Rather than drip-feeding us one or two mounts that are, admittedly, very pretty they should release a whole lot more of them - even just re-colours of existing mounts or expensive vendor mounts such as the Mammoth. That way there would be more diversity of mounts maintained in the game and people could have more of a choice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then again, this time the mount isn't just a recolor, and has it's actual own model and it looks like they put into it more than a few hours, so this one might last allot longer than the horse.<br />
<br />
On a second thought, there will be bazzilion more of these than there ever were horses, so this one might get annoying even faster.</div></div><hr />

People complain about &quot;everything&quot;? It's a fucking reskin, why would you NOT complain? If you pay €15,- or whatever for it, the least you'd expect from Blizzard is to have a little bit of decency and make it a complete new one, or at least other animations.</div></div><hr />

Yeah well the very easy solution for you here is to not buy it. Simple. You wouldn't go to a store complaining that every bike has wheels and peddles, and the store owner doesn't do anything new like using tank tracks. If you don't like it, don't buy it. It's a purely cosmetical item that isn't gonna be breaking the game.</div></div><hr />

Do you want that mount for free? get a hippogryph, its the same flight model fro what i can see. I love my mounts but will not buy this, i don't want to encourage blizzard to put more mounts in the store<br />

That's where the two got most of their mount animation. IE the frame/flight animation and think the /mountspecial command animation. So Sparklepony took nothing away from Invincible.<br />
<br />
So hey, my griff was ripped off! QQQQQ.<br />
<br />
Sarcastic qq aside, that mount is god damn beautiful. And, it doesn't sparkle. Meaning my manly characters [mostly orcs lol] don't have to sit on a pos wyvern or a sparkle horse! And now my lowbie toons have two flying mounts to switch between now, huzzah.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Lemme guess. You don't use nether drakes anymore because everyone has them? You don't use Protos anymore because everyone has atleast one version? You don't use Nether rays anymore because everyone has them? You don't use a dragonhawk/hppogriff because everyone has one? You don't use land mounts because my god, everyone has one! And oh, you can't use frostwyrms because everyone has those! I bet you don't use the festival mounts because again my god, everyone has them!!! So what must you ride? The pimp rocket from Love is in the air!<br />
<br />
But oh I forget, that rocket only exists like about 1/2 a server!<br />
<br />
So what do you ride sir that 'looks awesome' yet, is not commonplace?<br />

Look, here, have this violin. That's so small it fits between my fingers and thumb. Skeeekeeek eeeeeekeeeek.<br />

I don't care if you feel deprived of awesomesauce. Because -I- am not.<br />
I agree with him to an extent, I enjoy using the rare mounts, I don't really have the dilemmacas a Druid because I just use my flight form but I use my amani bear as a ground mount for that reason mainly. Each to their own I say, people verbally assaulting one another because their preference differs on a cosmetic levelcin this thread is quite funny. I sure as hell won't buy the lion but everyone else be my guest.</div></div><hr />

Hint, you little whiner. Just because you agree with irrational whining doesn't mean he should. Besides, how much difference do you want in a flying mount? In the end, they will all make the same motions, because there are not over 9000 unique ways to use wings to fly. So what use would there be in creating a whole different skeleton for one, simple almost unnoticable jerk or flap of this or that wing? Also. As far as I know, no one is there behind you, holding a gun to your head; forcing you to buy a certain winged mount. If you don't like it, isn't it simple? Don't buy it. There's no proper argument you can have to protect you from that fact. And if you feel affected by other people having the mount while you don't, even though you think it isn't worthy of your almighty money. Then you're oversensitive and I would advise you to stop playing a game. Any game until you'd feel less offended over trivial issues.<br />
<br />
As for Paladin T2. No, it isn't the best set, unlike what many say. But you can't say it's ugly. Because if so, then what set is not ugly in your opinion? Sigh..</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks that. XD Not only is the head a massive unmoving stone like thing the front legs, when in the air, look like stumpy shetland pony legs. It just looks off.. maybe if they fixed the armor on the front legs and toned down the size of the head. From behind it almost looks like it could be a horse and that'd fit better with the scale of it's body than that....head.</div></div><hr />

I mean i like them, but 25$? if it was less maybe but i just don't see why you would spend that much money MORE money on a game that you already pay for. I mean i can understand 10$ maybe, as a maximum but above that? And that is added to the common place thing, now anytime i see a celestial steed i die a little inside because they were EVERYWHERE that was ALL you saw EVER!. <br />
<br />
on a more funny note, even though i like (untill ^ sets in) the design, there were several times in the video that this when through my mind &quot;Why aren't you capturing the boy!&quot; &quot;Because i have a big head and little arms!&quot;</div></div><hr />

I remember I almost bought the celestial steed on the day it came out and before I logged in. I couldn't find my card or something so I logged in anyway and saw one. Then another. Then another three. Then realised Dalarn was crawling with them. So was Org. And all the leveling areas. Now I'm glad I didn't get one.<br />
<br />
I know some people get all huffy about people who say this - the whole &quot;If you like a mount it shouldn't matter how many other people have it&quot; arguement. But part of the appeal of these mount is that they &quot;look awesome&quot;. Things lose the ability to &quot;look awesome&quot; when they are very commonplace - people were awestruck by the cinema, TV sets, washing machines and, more recently. 3D movies. People would gather round rich peoples' windows and peer in at TV sets when they first came out because they were so amazing. Now they are so common place that we give a new TV set about as much admiration as we might give a new coat or a new pair of socks. Same thing with the celestial steed and, I suspect, with this mount. It looks amazing in this vid - flying solo through SW, but if that video was the thing flying through SW and passing by about 30-40 other people on identical mounts it would suddenly look a bit ridiculous.<br />
<br />
So I'll probably pass - and if you buy it, more power to you. Maybe you are a bit less shallow than me. Or maybe a bit more, I'm not sure.<br />
<br />
I just wish they would make a new new set of mounts that were cool and that I could work for on my own. My guild is kinda crap at killing final bosses in raid tiers and my ability to make gold is pathetic - and I'm getting bored of my netherdrakes.<br />
<br />
<br />
This man speaks the truth, my guess is EVERYONE will be on this the day its released and then after that nowhere because no one wants to be on a commonplace mount. Thats why you almost never see regular faction ground mounts unless its a new toon getting leveled. This mount should have been a guild reward or an achievement reward or something else if they wanted to keep its appeal. Dont get me wrong this is a cash cow for blizzard and very smart on their part letting all of us suckers buy it.</div></div><hr />

They pay 25$ to have a mount they think is cool. They don't care if thousands of people have it.<br />

They reused the hippogryph model for the Celestial Steed and it came out terrible. The running animation is ridiculous, the legs are broken when it flies, etc. You can't blame people for being wary of reusing models when it's been so poorly done in the past.<br />

Guess what, no one cares that 1000000 people will have it. If they cared about it, they would be thinking like you ... yet most of the posts state &quot;Ooooh I'm getting that mount!&quot; no one in their right mind is going to think &quot;HEY That is an awesome mount that costs no more than $25~ I'm going to be the only one to think of going to the STORE and buying it making me the ONLY person to have it!&quot; They KNOW tons are gonna be riding it and STILL are going to get it because they are not shallow and trying to be &quot;special&quot; or &quot;unique&quot;.<br />
<br />

Perhaps a slight alteration and it will be more Neutral the Alliance Lion Element and the Horde Scorpion element. The Manticore it is a Lion with a Scorpion Tail and maybe Blizzard could make it fiery Just Search &quot;Manticore&quot; and you will see pics of it :)</div></div><hr />

I keep buying them to encourage more mounts to cut down in the people who feel the only way they are special raiders is by sitting on a mount. I thought raiding and completing the instance was the big &quot;achievement&quot; not the mount to flaunt around. Blizzard should remove all raid mounts and make every mount 100% common to really give raiders something to QQ about since obviously they do not appreciate one single raid given to them nor the &quot;Gear&quot; they cried about all through wrath about, and seem to only give a hoot about the mount they can get from it. :]</div></div><hr />

Way to generalize the community, you must be a STRONG person AND player.<br />
<br />
I can't even believe you'd spend so much RL money on a few pixels in an attempt to bring down the people you so obviously envy. Says more about yourself than the people who prefer riding a mount they progressed months for, rather than whip out their creditcard.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not gonna judge people who buy the mount (ok, I may a little when our guild starts making jokes about TRL, TRH was getting old, not to mention more rare), you should do whatever the heck you want with your money. I do judge the Blizzard Store selling pixels, though. I like the plushies. Being an avid plushie collector, sure, the pets that came with them I didn't really care about. But 25 dollars, or even if it'd just be 5 bucks, for something that really, really, should be available ingame through ingame gold or better yet, through some accomplishment... Just no.</div></div><hr />

Who the hell cares if you spend money on it or don't spend money on it or if everyone has one or if they don't. The point is if you like it and you want it. I bought my celestial steed and I am very pleased with it. Anyone who whines at me about it can just listen to me /mountspecial for the next 10 minutes or I'll just &quot;umadbro?&quot; and ignore. <br />
<br />

I already have the &quot;Tears of Noobs&quot; to ride. Now I want this for my Witch(unless Blizz decides to sell a perma broom for her.)<br />

Now all they need is the Obama campaign mount of a white unicorn that trails rainbows as it jumps.</div></div><hr />

Says more about yourself than the people who prefer riding a mount they progressed months for, rather than whip out their creditcard.<br />
<br />
Haha... i can't stop laughing at this quote that someone actually thought about and posted. Let's break it down.<br />
<br />
I can't even believe you'd spend so much RL money on a few pixels - Wow. Must be nice to play WoW for free. Didn't realize you could do it without the $14.95/month RL money fee. <br />
<br />
in an attempt to bring down the people you so obviously envy. - This might be the greatest part of the comment. Envy? The last thing people who can obviously afford $25 and work 20-40 hour weeks is thinking about is bringing down the gremlins who waste 40-80 hours a week looking at pixels ingame.<br />
<br />
Says more about yourself than the people who prefer riding a mount they progressed months for, rather than whip out their creditcard. - Exactly. Says that these individuals, who whip out their credit card, would rather be productive in society and family life then spend their whole time in a fake world.<br />
<br />
I don't even play the game anymore, since they've turned into a rehash of old content, but I had to comment on this. The above quote had me rolling. :D</div></div><hr />

New? By &quot;new&quot; you mean re-skinned Invincible.</div></div><hr />

My only worry is that it will look at my Sparkle Pony and see it as lunch.<br />
Oh well, I will deal with that problem later. First I will hug it and pet it and call it George.<br />

Also it appears that the wings in gliding almost detatch almost. Eh, i figured it would be cooler in action than in stills, but in action I was less impressed. Its an awsome idea, just not so sure on the actual creation. Here's to hoping they eventually make a new set or even 1 or two easy to get flying mounts that aren't dragons or reskinned base mounts. (Woo hoo for nether rays!)</div></div><hr />

No, because Blizzard saw how many idiots out there are willing to throw away their money for this garbage, and so, they will do it again.<br />

The way the armor wraps around the head and the light effects on the mane/legs/wings made it eye candy. I'll be willing to purchase for my alts to run about on instead of daggum wyverns,as for all the griping, if you don't like it don't buy it. Yeah it'll be everywhere, just like all the regular rep mounts, so If you don't like it then keep running around on whatever drake you worked to get and let others enjoy the mount that they worked for at actual jobs to get the cash to indulge. Will enjoy adding this one to my ever-growing mount collection.</div></div><hr />
