Give balance druids a stun or slightly longer cyclone or shorter cast time or some form of iceblock/CoS/bubble/BoP/demonform/Dispersion. Were not top to the arena's or likely to be. Are they implementing this because of PvE or PvP ?<br />
<br />

Hmmm.. is this buffed up because of the new 30sec CD?<br />
Don't think it helps much in pvp, if at all... CD should be 24 sec as the minimal trap CD. But I gues it's &quot;ok&quot; for PVE, if L&amp;L is actually good enough with a 30 sec CD to make explosiv shot sweet enough as a favour over MM spec.<br />
But it don't look that way.</div></div><hr />

Lethality works with Ambush on Live. But this new PTR patch will make Ambush crits do 30% less damage.<br />

No, -15% damage on Ambush crits.<br />
<br />
&quot;Increases the critical strike damage bonus of all combo moves by 30%.&quot;<br />
<br />
eg. non-crit 1000 -&gt; crit 1000 + (1000*1.3) = 2300 = +15%.</div></div><hr />

Seriously why remove the only somewhat usefall part of this spell. The damage it does is negligable. This makes it about the weakest 51 point talent there is. An aoe on a 3 min cooldown which doesn't break stealth or doesn't stun anyone, why even bother using it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Then dont use it? and look beyond your class only please. There are plenty of weak 51point talents. Hunters bm maybe? how about freal 51 point would change the bear to some cool black bear and thats it? ...<br />
The randomness was op in pvp and it got changed. Ofcourse you dont like it, since its a nerf..but coming out with all-end claims like worst talent ever, never going to use it ..its just meh :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
meh, stop talking bullshit.<br />
<br />
You're ignorant if you believe this change will make any difference for rogue pvp.<br />
It's ambush, ambush!<br />
got it?<br />
<br />
Mutilate is the dominating spec, and they dont use ambush at all.<br />
<br />
I dont have any problems at all with shadowdance rogues, they are well balanced.<br />
Mutilate rogues are the problem, it's not even their dmg.<br />
I (shaman) can tank them way longer than a feral druid, even with mind/wound/crippling on me.<br />
It's their utility that kills the enemy.<br />
while a feral druid can stun as much as a rogue, he cannot vanish,blind,evasion,prep,dismantle,mindnumbing,wound,gouge etc...<br />
<br />
shadowdance rogues dont have poisen dispel resist, they dont have the big dmg when they are out of stealth, they dont last long.<br />
using ambush while shadowdancing, you already get more combo points you can use.<br />
<br />
stop crying if you dont have a clue how classes work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It's fairly normal for Blizzard to sugarcoat a nerf with a minor buff somewhere else. And rogues, while OP in PvP aren't doing that well in PvE (where they were balanced under the effect of some bugs that used to boost their damage): So far they haven't received any compensation for that.</div></div><hr />

I somewhat expected this to happen, but I'd say it's still better than a &quot;moderate&quot; enchant. If they wanted to be *super* lame, they would have made it +500hp instead of stamina. It's just another tool in the arsenal, I'll still be carrying a weapon with titanguard in addition to one with hit and mongoose. Dropping 25 stamina on a slot where it didn't even exist already doesn't hurt me one bit. :) I'll take what I can get!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I can tell your main is the warrior. Bollocks its a buff. An extra combo point on Ambush is not needed by any spec. Whether the extra damage is needed on Ambush is debatable. I am sick of these quotes of 12k ambushes and 10k ambushes when these are far from the norm. My average is closer to 5k and my gear is not far from fully epic.<br />
<br />
The 12k and 10k ambushes are from subtlety spec which is a lot less OP than Mutilate. After the initial ambush the rogue will be backstabbing which takes a longer time to build the combo points for an eviscerate. They don't have poison dispel resistance, they don't have talents to apply 3 poisons at once.<br />
<br />
People should stop taking videos as the basis for their arguments because videos as a rule show the exceptions, that is the reason the video was made. Videos of 5k ambushes are not worth making. Come to think of it, I'm gonna make one, and then we will see how much attention is paid to it. It would be closer to the actual truth, but I bet it would be ignored.</div></div><hr />

Actually, I duelled a mage a couple of times , he had 360 res or something very close to it. I ambushed for 10k yes, so you mean that 40 more res would make any difference? Don't think so no.

It was already useless in pve, now they removed it's one use in pvp. I just don't understand it.<br />
<br />
Looking through arenajunkies rankings it's obvious druids aren't dominant in any bracket, let alone balance druids.<br />
And it was plenty easy to stop the stuns anyway, seeing as it didn't work when stunned, feared, ...<br />
<br />
I just hope it was a typo somewhere or they better have a shield wall coming to us as extra benefit of starfall.<br />
Starwall sounds quite nice actually.</div></div><hr />

With 400 res, he will die.<br />

But don't worry, you guys are the famous Rogues, not RetLoLs, you're not going to nerfed to the ground. Blizz will do a tiny nerf here and there to look like they're bashing you with the NerfBat and all the fury to make ppl happy and stop QQ. Then huge buff after ppl forget about Rogues and start to QQ about the next class.<br />
<br />
Altough I do remember ret pallies (and players from other classes with brains) doing the same thing as you now, trying to remind ppl about the new high end pvp at 80 instead of the screwed lvl70 pre-wotlk... so maybe... there is a minimal chance that Rogues will get smacked by the nerfbat a lot more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Apparently druids dont understand the true reason why starfall was introduced to the moonkin class. This move was established to increase the AoE dps for PvE ( and PvP in some cases). This move wasn't designed to get people out of stealth in a cheap way, nor was it designed to stun a target repeatedly, giving any moonkin plenty of time to cast starfire (with the benefits of natures grace), one of the most powerful spells in the game. So instead of QQing, look at what u have and enjoy the fact your one of the few classes that does incredible dps and can heal just as well ;P</div></div><hr />

This is what I said earlier, although my char has the new 50 stam version in my enchanting list, it's no longer available from the NPC, only the 40 stam on bracers is still there.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">epLe</div><div class="date">2009-01-15, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Starfall is allready way too situational to conclude it &quot;was established to increase the AoE dps for PvE&quot; primarely.<br />
Yes it is a dps boost on some bossfights where you can't pull adds, but we allready got treants for that which is a way better dps boost singletarget.<br />
<br />
The Starfall glyph was even added later to make it more PvE friendly. This indicates their primary intentions of the spell was to make it something useful for PvP. <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Blizzard was working on removing/limiting RNG elements in PvP and why they went and added an AoE stun is rather baffling. I'm glad they are removing it as random stuns just need to go away.</div></div><hr />

Just for the record my main is a Warlock (Zaef) and my alt is a Druid (Liefellen) both on the Shattered Hand server.<br />
<br />
I can tell you that Warlocks are in the worst PvP situation right now followed closely by Shadow Priests. The &quot;nerf&quot; to Starfall does suck (I'm Resto spec now but have a lot of experience with the Balance build) but it is far from the worst 51 point talent my friends.<br />
<br />
Chaos Bolt and Haunt are two end-tree talents that have significant casting times and do minimal damage. Of all the casters Warlocks are the only class to have an end-tree talent that has a casting time and to make it worse we have it in two trees. Now, I'm not disagreeing that the Starfall nerf is a bummer but the spell is still an instant cast/non-channeled AoE spell that does a fair amount of damage considering you hit one button and forget about it.<br />
<br />
The other caster AoE spells (Blizzard, Reign of Fire, Mind Sear as well as Hurricane) are channeled so they can be interrupted not to mention the caster cannot DPS while the spell is in effect. I just hope that Balance Druids realize that this is not the worse 51 talent and that it's still a decent (though nerfed) ability. =D<br />
<br />
As for the Rogues on here let me say this: you will still destroy clothies with ease so have no worries. On top of the Warlock's newfound end-game gimp PvP status, Rogues have been destroying us ever since CoS was introduced and no doubt it shall continue. I can't tell what specs the Rogues are that have been manhandling me and I don't know the details about the Rogue trees but sitting on nearly 700 resil I can say that I still get double Ambushed frequently and am dead within seconds following some miscellaneous other ability.<br />
<br />
Even if the crit damage of Ambush is reduced 30% there is rarely any stunlocking involved in my death currently. So following the patch, the double Ambush approach will just require some minor CC until you find a way to make up that 30% and kill me.<br />
<br />
It's sad but true. If this change means you cannot kill plate classes as easily well then I'd say that's balanced: you wear leather and can destroy non-Feral Druid specs as well as all clothies (save maybe Disc priests as they seem immortal) which accounts for a large majority of the classes. That should bring you some comfort! =p</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You seem to forget starfall stops casting if you get stunned, feared or if someone farts in your general direction. In pvp that means any decent team will make sure the damage of it is close to nothing.<br />
In pve its uses are so limited, an aoe on a 3 minute cooldown really doesn't help that much. The fact its range is so huge just makes it near impossible to use it often and the damage is honestly pathetic for its cooldown.<br />
<br />
I do agree warlocks have issues, Blizzard just messed up their design for WoTLK pvp. They're just too stupid to realise or too stubborn to change it. But that has nothing to do with the fact moonkin aren't really doing swell either.<br />
<br />
Seeing as they removed all uses for starfall, i'd rather just have them replace it with starwall or something. We need a proper defensive ability.</div></div><hr />

I can't tell what specs the Rogues are that have been manhandling me and I don't know the details about the Rogue trees but sitting on nearly 700 resil I can say that I still get double Ambushed frequently and am dead within seconds following some miscellaneous other ability.<br />
<br />
Even if the crit damage of Ambush is reduced 30% there is rarely any stunlocking involved in my death currently. So following the patch, the double Ambush approach will just require some minor CC until you find a way to make up that 30% and kill me.<br />
<br />
It's sad but true. If this change means you cannot kill plate classes as easily well then I'd say that's balanced: you wear leather and can destroy non-Feral Druid specs as well as all clothies (save maybe Disc priests as they seem immortal) which accounts for a large majority of the classes. That should bring you some comfort! =p<br />
<br />
<br />
Wow! I did NOT know that if you are stunned or Feared after hitting the Starfall button that the ability would cease. This does in fact greatly diminish the usefulness of the spell.<br />
<br />
However having had to face Balance Druids in PvP I found it difficult to get a Fear off as it was due to the:<br />
1) Treant spell delay (which though the mechanic has been improved is understandably still annoying for all caster classes)<br />
2) the Starfall stun procs<br />
3) the Starfire stun procs<br />
4) and the spell interrupt of Typhoon.<br />
<br />
Perhaps Blizzard just thought it was too much CC right off the bat against other casters? I am still really shocked that the ability is interrupted if the Druid is stunned or Feared. This is good to know though for future fights!</div></div><hr />

You or your teammate should easily be able to cc the druid some way, certainly if the druid uses starfall at the beginning of a match, when you still have all cool downs ready.<br />
<br />
Anyway I don't get why anyone would use starfall anymore after this. It'll only break cc and that's it. The damage is low, it doesn't break stealth anymore and it doesn't stun.<br />
<br />
ps. If you let a druid cast starfire, you need more practice.</div></div><hr />

Well I'm not a professional PvP player but I can assure you that when I'm evenly matched (usually only against other Warlocks) I can hold my own. That being said when I, or anyone, is stunned there's very little a player can do. In arena, the few times I've dealt with Balance Druids, my partner would get CCd by the non-Druid partner (be it a silence or stun but normally we find Druids with Mages) thus leaving me to deal with the Druid as the Mage would have since Ice Blocked. Starfall has ALWAYS procced and stunned me before I could get a Fear off thus giving the Druid time to cast Starfire/Typhoon/Wrath spam. In addition my Felguard's attacks normally trigger the Owlkin frenzy thus reducing the pushback suffered from my partner's melee attacks. It is a vicious cycle: to hit or not to hit the Moonkin?<br />
<br />
Now don't get me wrong I'm not QQing here (I've tried very hard not to throughout all of my posts because it's already been done so much). I'm just stating that the proc frequency from my experience has always nailed me. Lowering that chance or even reducing the stun duration may have been a better alternative rather than to eliminate it entirely from Starfall.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panoramixe</div><div class="date">2009-01-15, 10:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well you could just trinket the first stun and go for a death coil =&gt; fear combo. Even if the moonkin trinkets the fear, starfall will pretty much be over by then anyway.<br />
<br />
But I do understand warlocks. They have lost everything they had in TBC and have been given little in retun. The big strength warlocks had was the fact they died slowly and that their dots would do quite nice damage over time, Blizzard nerfed both by removing/lowering the defences and letting dots be weakened by resilience.<br />
<br />
I just don't get why it takes them so long to figure out a way to give locks a fighting chance. And no resilience won't change anything and yes the health pools of the overpowered classes, paladins and death knights, grow faster than that of cloth/leather users.</div></div><hr />

Here is the reasoning for it:<br />
Had this enchant gone live it would have become THE enchant for nearly all tanks. It would not have been an interesting choice. We would have had to keep introducing higher tiers of the same enchant, or else players would just keep using this version for perpetuity. We put Stamina already on many items. We don't think your weapon needs one as well. I received messages from several tanks for very prominent guilds asking us to please not go forward with this enchant. They understood why it was bad for the game.<br />
<br />
Death knights have access to superior enchants in part because they do not have a shield or ranged weapon slot and the stats provided by those items.<br />
<br />
The PTR is for testing. If you find yourself frustrated that things change between the PTR and live, I would suggest you stop paying attention to the PTR notes. Even if a change like this had already gone live, we probably would have changed it anyway. We did not like what this enchant would have done for the game.<br />
<br />
And<br />
There are already stamina enchants on many pieces of gear. Casters can go that route of stacking spellpower on as much gear as possible, but if they ignore int and mana regen, that spellpower will be for naught. With tanks, we have found that given the choice between stamina and anything else (assuming you are comparing things of equivalent level) stamina will always win. One of the few enchants where you actually have a decison would be replaced by yet another stamina enchant. I am pretty confident the same thing would happen with a stamina to cloak enchant.<br />
<br />
Here is the player's point of view: Ah, an enchant for my weapon. That will help me survive and help out my healers, therefore making me a slightly better tank. Maybe I'll be slightly better prepared for KT or Sarth + 3 or Ulduar. Awesome.<br />
<br />
Except... here is the developer's point of view: Okay, we just buffed every tank in the game by 750 health. That means we now have to make every mob hit slightly harder to compensate. Otherwise we are just buffing tank survivability for no reason. The net effect to you would be pretty negligible in the long run, while any tank who chose not to put stamina on his or her weapon would suddenly be at a disadvantage.</div></div><hr />
