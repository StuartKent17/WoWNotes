I think the best system is still the one Blizzard did themselves. Is it really hard for a ticket hosting site to just flat out tell you what position you are in line?</div></div><hr />

How is it a waste if they are getting the 2 days worth of entertainment plus a holiday if they choose to stay in California longer? Merely your opinion. I mean sure the VT is a cheaper alternative but some people would like to go to one in their lifetimes which is understandable. I never will partly because money and mostly because as stated above I'm afraid of flying.</div></div><hr />

Not really considering they're already priced 2x what they're worth. If Blizz is going to gouge their fans why shouldn't others get in on the action?</div></div><hr />

LOL, yeah cuz the experience of getting shafted then watching tons of scalpers flood ebay at insane markups totally has me pumped to go through it again on Saturday! <br />
<br />
The thing I don't get is, come late October Blizzcon tickets always start showing up on craigslist in LA by the truckload for face value. Would just rather buy honestly and not have to worry about getting scammed though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and when thousands keep paying, you can keep calling them idiots, and the price will still be correct, because if you ever want the tickets much cheaper you cannot get them so by that logic you must pay what people are selling them for, which = their value!<br />
<br />
when blizzard stop selling out their tickets in seconds, or even failing to fill blizzcon you might be right until then, the tickets are in fact worth that much.</div></div><hr />

The big and interesting panels usually revolved around WoW, where each expansion means a lot of new information. This year, the expansion will be freshly released, the movie will be out, Overwatch live, HS will have a new expansion, SC2 is no longer in production ... I mean, I wouldn't want to buy a ticket to watch panels about a new Diablo expansion, where the only info that could be interesting is a potential new class. <br />
<br />
The rest? New HotS heroes and maps, that can be presented in a 1min30sec video. New Overwatch heroes and maps? Same. New HS cards? I don't need a panel for that. So with what would actually be valuable information, is information about a 7.1 WoW patch and that is maybe one 1h panel. <br />
<br />
I wish they'd at least reveal their panel schedule to see which games will be in the spotlight to help us make a decision.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps asinine posts like yours are self evident that many, many people still do still support Blizzard? Every year Blizzcon is absolutely packed with hungry, engaged players that want the best from Blizzard. Every year millions of users engage in WoW and other franchises from Blizzard.<br />
<br />
If you're tired of Blizzard then please move on?<br />
<br />
Or, if instead you want better from Blizzard then please share us your thoughts !?</div></div><hr />

But... but... wasn't the Nostralius closure the biggest thing to hit the internet ever? I thought Blizzard was going to be forced to open legacy servers by a tidal wave of public outrage?<br />
<br />
You mean to tell me that in reality, nobody outside a couple of hundred thousand people nobody gives a fuck?</div></div><hr />

It's one of those once in a lifetime things and yet for tickets to sell out in 9 minutes and then pop up on EBay at 845 dollars is pretty sickening :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
the trip there would cost 5 times the amount of the Bcon ticket for me :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the same money you could buy two tickets for a five day music festival and see all the bands you ever heard of or buy a season ticket for the local football club (Germany). <br />
Even the virtual ticket is massively overprized.<br />
<br />
Well it's £24.99 usually here for the VT and I'd say it's worth for the goodies and 2 days of uninterrupted content.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skatblast</div><div class="date">2016-04-21, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What can we expect at this years' Blizzcon anyway? The big and interesting panels usually revolved around WoW, where each expansion means a lot of new information. This year, the expansion will be freshly released, the movie will be out, Overwatch live, HS will have a new expansion, SC2 is no longer in production ... I mean, I wouldn't want to buy a ticket to watch panels about a new Diablo expansion, where the only info that could be interesting is a potential new class. <br />
<br />
The rest? New HotS heroes and maps, that can be presented in a 1min30sec video. New Overwatch heroes and maps? Same. New HS cards? I don't need a panel for that. So with what would actually be valuable information, is information about a 7.1 WoW patch and that is maybe one 1h panel. <br />
<br />
I wish they'd at least reveal their panel schedule to see which games will be in the spotlight to help us make a decision.<br />
<br />
Idk doesn't really matter, i go for vacation and to party + meet with friends i see there every year. SC2 world championship will be happening that is good enough for me. I didn't watch any of the panels last year besides the opening ceremony.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First time I went, was the ultimate &quot;get your geek on&quot; fun experience, had a blast with a bunch of buddies. Went for a few years after just because the first experience was so fun, but didn't enjoy it as much and haven't gone since.<br />
<br />
Either way, it can be a lot of fun, or not fun at all depending on who you are. We get it, not everyone enjoys blizzcon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PS you cant party and play games. You think you can, but you really cant!<br />
<br />
Right, because when the convention center closes at 9 PM, you just have to go back to your hotel room for the rest of the night. You really don't have a clue, do you?</div></div><hr />
