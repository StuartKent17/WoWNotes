Furious Gladiator's Libram of Justice will now only grant additional healing to Flash of Light as originally intended.<br />
Amice of Inconceivable Horror and Vestments of the Blind Denizen will no longer have class restrictions<br />
It will now take the proper 4 seconds of drinking in arenas before a player will start gaining mana.<br />
Storm, Earth and Fire talent root proc will now properly affect a 10 yard radius.<br />
Mimiron Assault Bots no longer despawn during the transition from phase3 to phase 4. This should allow the achievement Not-So-Friendly Fire to be completable. <br />
<br />
Bracket Rating Improvements Are Now Active<br />
The update to the 3v3 and 5v5 brackets are now active. <br />
<br />
--------- <br />
<br />
The current arena rating system allows more players to have higher ratings in the 2v2 bracket when compared to 3v3 and 5v5. We are preparing an in-game update that will be improving the rating system of the 3v3 and 5v5 brackets to allow all three of the brackets to have a similar number of players able to achieve ratings on par with what’s currently possible in our 2v2 arena bracket. As a result, we are changing the personal and team rating requirements for the item level 239 weapons from 2200 to 2350, but keep in mind the tooltip will continue to show the requirement as 2200 until patch 3.1.2.<br />
<br />
As a result of the above improvements, this change will prevent an excessive number of players from reaching much higher ratings and acquiring the highest grade of weapons in-game. The increase in rating requirements is designed to keep the number of players able to obtain these arena weapons on par with the number of players who are able to obtain the same grade of weapons from Heroic Ulduar.<br />
<br />
When Arena Season 7 launches we plan to return the highest rated season 7 weapons back to 2200 while also ensuring that the difficulty in achieving that rating is closer to what is intended, yet of similar difficulty for all brackets (rather than being easier for 2v2).

<br />
Raids &amp; Dungeons<br />
&quot;Nerfed&quot; raid instances<br />
We changed some of the base design of the game to cut down on the idea of content (and the items come with it) being only for a certain group of the playerbase. We have tried to open up content and give more people more things to do.<br />
<br />
I don't have any numbers to share, but we are seeing more people in the raid instances than in the past, so people are running things and picking up as many epics as possible. A lot of players are skipping normal dungeons because it's faster to do so, but they have done it on other characters already so they know the fights and just want to get geared up asap. Sure, we could limit the number of epics to certain content and whatnot, but we don't feel that would be a real benefit to the game.

<br />
Itemization<br />
Choosing the best item<br />
The goal is not “Whatever Mimiron drops, I put on,” nor should it be “Whatever Mimiron drops, I shard unless it is loot that some spreadsheet says is my best piece.” Gear is a complex puzzle. If you put on one piece, you might want to change another piece. That piece with all the Int might get you hit capped, so you change a gem or enchant. It might not be an upgrade for another player of your spec but it’s an upgrade for you. Make sure you are making decisions about gear wisely, and include in that the way you play, not what a forum post says your theoretical dps output could potentially be. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17223095980-discuss-itemization-without-insulting-devs.html))<br />
<br />
Stats distribution on gear for multiple classes<br />
We have allowed the “good stats” and “bad stats” to get too far apart. The answer, as you point out, is not to only design gear with very narrow uses because it is only attractive to one spec (but then exceedingly attractive to that spec). We can’t be in a situation where armor pen is junk for Unholy DKs (because they do so much spell damage) because then we are making Unholy DK tier sets. From an item design point of view, yuck. We just need to get the stats closer together on a class-side, not an item-side. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17223095980-discuss-itemization-without-insulting-devs.html))<br />

Moonkin T8 4 Pieces Bonus<br />
The reason we increased the proc chance from 5% to 15% is because of the issue where you can lose the proc on an existing Starfire. For a number of technical reasons, we can't apply the proc to a spell already being cast. <br />
<br />
[...] The problem is that you can't modify a spell's cast time while the spell is already being cast. The tooltip is accurate... if frustrating. We just talked about it and we might have a solution. It might not be hotfixable, but it shouldn't take until 3.2. We might lower the proc rate if we got it to work however. I'll try and update when we work it out.

Is druid tree form fun?<br />
This is an open question to the community. Is druid Tree of Life form fun? The question applies to both PvP and PvE, so it would be helpful to provide for which part of the game your answer applies.<br />
<br />
We think cat and bear forms are fun. They have very clear roles and unique abilities. Tree of Life has no unique abilities. It essentially forces you to give up a portion of your class abilities in order to be as good a healer as other classes. In PvP it lets you tank a little, but again with the downside of giving away a good deal of your mobility, damage and crowd control.<br />
<br />
Please do not over-interpret our asking for feedback. No huge changes to Tree of Life are on the way and we may in fact never change it. But it's something we have been discussing lately, so we thought it would be interesting to get a wider perspective.

MP5 Gear isn't really useful for Holy paladins<br />
Yes, that is exactly what I said. You are saying you’ll just use the shaman gear. Why? Because you don’t care about the mana regen. Why? Because your mana regen is so good based on things like Illumination that mana regen stats are not attractive. That doesn’t mean we stop putting regen stats on plate. That means we nerf Illumination. An even better solution would be to get rid of MP5 and make Illumination return mana based on your spirit. Now not only do you want a regen stat, but you want the same stat that other healers want.

Elemental Shamans do not gain anything from Spirit or MP5 items<br />
Agreed. As you point out, that is why we made sure your tier sets didn’t have them. We can’t remove the regen stats from everything else for obvious reasons. We can make the regen stats useful to you, but then we need to put them back on your tiered sets as well as nerfing your damage across the board to make up for the fact that some kind of new regen to dps conversion scaling will make you better. The conversion mechanics do the job, but they’re a little muddy and complicated and I’m not sure we’d call them a raging success long-term.

What I'd REALLY like is some form of transportation between all the EK ally cities and Exodar... I mean yeah there's already a boat to Darkshore which can then be hopped off and taken to Stormwind now, but there's no direct method of transport to it...<br />

Ugh, while I do agree it's nicer having a bit more &quot;friendly&quot; raid content also, I have huge reserves about it on the flip side... Illidan was a nasty SOB who was a huge threat to the world after he went all demonic back in WC3. He shouldn't be doable by pugs dangit, the skull he holds prior to engaging him should be a pugger's skull. Certain lower level stuff like Naxx and perhaps Ulduar yeah, fine and dandy to have it open to pugs.

Divine Illumination and Divine Favor also helps us keeping our manapool full longer. This should stay the same as it works fine. I don't mind that there is more mp5 on our gear BUT it must not destroy the crit on the gear. What I notice now is that my critrating is getting lower and it is replaced by haste and mp5. Haste and mp5 aren't bad stats because if you implement them and think through what you want with it it will give you the edge. <br />
<br />
Removing mp5 and changing the mechanics of Divine Illumination to bond it with spirit it a paladins worst nightmare. On many items that have spirit there is no crit or the overall stats on that item are not ideal for a Paladin. Ofcourse it will bring the healers closer but healers should stay unique with there own usefull stats and spirit is not one of them.(for a paladin that is.)<br />
<br />
I think that all this whining is pure and only the fault of players who do not know a Paladin through and through. If you stack int you can heal a lot with HL and have a lot of overall healing but also a lot of overhealing. You can stack haste and mp5 to maintain your manapool and heal for a long time with not only HL but also FoL and HS. You can also stack crit and int for even more overall healing, you can also stack with completely other mixes of stats, the point is, do whatever suits you and try it. The more you test this the better you will get insight of the ups and downs of you choices. It is fine this way and I personally try to find a balance between Int, crit, haste and mp5 to be a good healer at any situation, and you know what? somtimes I own at certain fights and sometimes I have to fight hard to be on top or admit that another healer in the group is stronger in that situation. We are unique and have our ups and downs at each fight.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deathseeker</div><div class="date">2009-05-22, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I forgot to mention, you cant ask from paladins to all of the sudden stack spirit that will push away other much more important stats, the entire identity of what a Paladin is will vanish. We could also make the choice to just ignore this at all and find other options to heal, to later find out this will not work because of this &quot; unnecesary&quot; chance.<br />
<br />
Face it, somtimes we own and sometimes we dont depending on the situation, and all these situations gives us the possibility to sometimes use and sometimes not use certain ability's. The way it is now is fine, like all other classes we have ups and downs and this makes us all unique. Don't push all healerclasses in the same direction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty much the worst advice about gearing I've ever heard. For the vast majority of players the right thing to do is to take gear that a spreadsheet says is an upgrade and shard the rest. While in theory gearing is a complex puzzle, in practice the choices are severely limited by the small number of viable choices and by what happens to drop.<br />
<br />
Going against the spreadsheets by trying to factor in &quot;the way you play&quot; will only lead to bad performance. This is because: a) spreadsheets tend to assume optimal cycles and play-styles so if &quot;the way you play&quot; is significantly different then you need to fix your play-style rather than pick different gear, and b) it is inviting you to wear gear based on personal feelings rather than actual evidence, inevitably leading to suboptimal choices.</div></div><hr />

It is actually the best advice. Just because a spreadsheet says something is not a gear upgrade does not mean it is not a gear upgrade for you at that time. To often people ignore actual upgrades in gear because their spreadsheet lists the best in slot items, and what is still an upgrade isn't one of them. So they pass on the item.<br />
<br />
What the blue is saying, and you seem to miss, is that if an item is an upgrade take it. Don't pass because a spreadsheet tells you it isn't one, because spreadsheets don't often take your exact character makeup into account.<br />
<br />
<br />
Upgrades are upgrades.</div></div><hr />

I mean, what is Blizzards problem ?<br />
Game mechanics in terms of which class needs which stats hasnt changed since Naxx and in Naxx were usefull elemental items as well as usefull holy paladin items...<br />
are they just to lazy to change one of the three phyiscal dps mail boots or one of the two healing mail boots to elemental shaman boots (there are currently ZERO) ?<br />
are they to lazy to change holy paladins the way they NEED mp5 or change the gear that it doesnt have mp5 ?<br />
The bullshit the blue is posting there doesnt help anyone, DO something instead of wasting time with giving apologies.</div></div><hr />

Just to point out that mages had the &quot;spirit value for them increased&quot; in 3.1 (if I'm not mistaken.. post Naxx anyway).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RWeber</div><div class="date">2009-05-22, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is actually the best advice. Just because a spreadsheet says something is not a gear upgrade does not mean it is not a gear upgrade for you at that time. To often people ignore actual upgrades in gear because their spreadsheet lists the best in slot items, and what is still an upgrade isn't one of them. So they pass on the item.<br />
<br />
<br />
The whole point is that you do not know what is an actual upgrade and what is not, no matter how much you think you do based on your intuitive feelings. You can either a) trust that if a spreadsheet says it's an upgrade then you take it, if not then you don't, or b) do actual testing yourself with every possible combination of gear that you have available with enough trials that you get statistically meaningful results. The option b) is simply not a realistic option so you're left with a).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What the blue is saying, and you seem to miss, is that if an item is an upgrade take it. Don't pass because a spreadsheet tells you it isn't one, because spreadsheets don't often take your exact character makeup into account.<br />
<br />
Upgrades are upgrades.<br />
<br />
<br />
No, the main argument was that you should pick gear &quot;wisely&quot; and implying that spreadsheets/theorycrafting are not a wise way to do so, instead advocating some purely subjective &quot;does it fit my play style&quot; nonsense.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, all worthwhile spreadsheets do take into account the whole character makeup as well as raid buffs etc. That's the whole point. You seem to think that there is some absolute revealed truth about which item is an upgrade and which isn't. That is not true, the only viable source for such information is a spreadsheet.<br />
<br />
The bottom line: If the spreadsheet says it's an upgrade, then take it. If not, then pass on it.</div></div><hr />

Yes, that is exactly what I said. You are saying you’ll just use the shaman gear. Why? Because you don’t care about the mana regen. Why? Because your mana regen is so good based on things like Illumination that mana regen stats are not attractive. That doesn’t mean we stop putting regen stats on plate. That means we nerf Illumination. An even better solution would be to get rid of MP5 and make Illumination return mana based on your spirit. Now not only do you want a regen stat, but you want the same stat that other healers want.&quot;<br />
<br />
IF it wasent in blue letters id say it was some kinda nerd rage from a guy that just lost some mail piece to a pally.but it just goes to show yet again that blizzards number 1 way of fixing things is nerfs.<br />
whats next? <br />
blue post: NOONE is using the new super crapy 2h mace we made cause it has lame stats.we will now nerf 2h axes Cause we notice everyone was using betrayer of humanity instead.oh and all u melee now need INT cause it helps u figure out vital points GL Regearing.</div></div><hr />

Divine Illumination and Divine Favor also helps us keeping our manapool full longer. This should stay the same as it works fine. I don't mind that there is more mp5 on our gear BUT it must not destroy the crit on the gear. What I notice now is that my critrating is getting lower and it is replaced by haste and mp5. Haste and mp5 aren't bad stats because if you implement them and think through what you want with it it will give you the edge. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You don't need to change your gear for plate Ulduar holy gear. You can just keep your old naxx gear and use the few good new plates/mails. I've seen lots of paladins with 5~8 Ulduar pieces and they have 150 spellpower more then myself, but they lost almost 5% crit. Haste kept the same level mostly. What is important to you? Good stats or high rank at wow-heroes?<br />
<br />
People need to stop crying about MP5 gear. If you don't like it, you don't use it. I'm pretty sure we can heal any hard-modes with t7 content gear. About shammans crying and get ninjaed, I don't give i damn about it, if the mail is better tha a plate, im going to get it.<br />
<br />
And I really hope GC is joking when he says &quot;nerf Illumination&quot;.</div></div><hr />

For a number of technical reasons, we can't apply the proc to a spell already being cast.<br />
<br />
[...] The problem is that you can't modify a spell's cast time while the spell is already being cast. The tooltip is accurate... if frustrating. We just talked about it and we might have a solution. It might not be hotfixable, but it shouldn't take until 3.2. We might lower the proc rate if we got it to work however. I'll try and update when we work it out. (Source)<br />
<br />
So they increased procchance on a bonus that dont work to compensate that it dont work. /endlogic<br />

Nah, our kill wasn't -that- close. We had 15 alive when he died. That SS was just late, corpse had already even despawned. Zaroua probably just clicked off heroism or something. http://www.premoguild.com/images/killshots/firefighter.jpg Is the second of the kill.</div></div><hr />

I just got a BiS head piece, but it has no hit. I am now far below hit cap. I just got T8 Gloves, giving me my 2 piece bonus. Too bad thy also sport no hit, again leaving me under the cap. Now I wish I had some hit gear in the bank to fix this.<br />

<br />
The fact that you worry about things like reaching some arbitrary caps and balancing your stats is usually a good indication that you haven't analyzed your character with a spread sheet. They are precisely the kinds of things you end up (incorrectly) doing when you rely on intuition rather than actual evidence to make your choices.</div></div><hr />
