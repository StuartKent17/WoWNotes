Level 1 Heirloom Mount<br />
Collecting all heirloom items awards a special mount usable by level 1 characters.<br />
<br />
Does this mean we need the fishing event BoA for this mount? When I won it I took the trinket that turns you into a fish.<br />
I've asked about that and was informed that the achievement involves collecting a number of heirlooms (not all of them). Working on getting clarification on the Heirloom collections tab and will be updating the 6.1 PTR Patch Notes with more concrete information once it's available. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/359496-mount-at-level-1-61/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/15701397643?page=2#24))<br />
<br />
Ashran Timing Hotfix<br />
As you've probably witnessed, on many servers Ashran had digressed into a situation where the two factions were avoiding any confrontation. One faction would complete the outer events while the other faction would kill the faction leader. This isn't ideal, as the Horde and Alliance should be fighting more regularly in Ashran. <br />
<br />
Recently, we made changes to the frequency of events and the time between battles in the middle road. After a boss is killed, the center lane will take 30 minutes to reset. We hope this encourages the team that just won the middle lane to venture off into the rest of the zone for a time before the fight begins anew. Furthermore, we hope that faction’s presence in the outer events will encourage the other faction to fight in the center lane a bit more, since winning the events is no longer a given.<br />
<br />
We'll continue to consider your constructive Ashran feedback and appreciate those of you providing it. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/359433-2nd-blizzard-hotfix-without-warning/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16016273468?page=2#34))</div></div><hr />

<br />
The lockout is for both sides. If the alliance kills the horde leader, the horde have to wait 30 mins for the central battle to start up again.<br />
<br />
In essence, when the middle battle is up both factions will (should want to) do it. And when one of the leaders gets killed, both factions will do events. <br />
<br />
It works fine.</div></div><hr />

The ultimate goal is to have a battle with the opposing faction. Not necessarily to get conquest cap(which the only real way to fix that is to remove the Ashran requirement for Conquest cap), gear up alts quickly, or a chance for the Alliance to get a 660 piece.<br />
<br />
This will definitely add some fun battles, but we all can agree that it really just needs basic updates.<br />
-Interactive Maps, I have put at least 40 hours into Ashran, and I still have no idea what each area on the road is called. Let alone which one is being contested.<br />
-Auto grouping, and perhaps without a raid leader, or someone who has certain Ashran achievements has a higher priority on lead. <br />
-Balanced and removal of anti-fun mechanics: Most people stand in &quot;Groot's&quot; root and die. 15 Hunters Barraging. A dragon. A knock-up to your death. There are infinite stalling mechanics to make the 4 hour push to their base null. <br />
-Less choke points. I'm sorry but AV failed because of the bridge, which is why most fights took place in the center. Change the bridge, make it wider, remove it altogether.<br />
-Climbable terrain. At least more paths, and less blockades.<br />
-The graveyard, if I have to run back to my base one more time from the center of the map...<br />
-Nerf on the NPC damage, gladiators are fine. But a single axe can wipe an entire raid because the width of it is the size of the bridge. <br />
<br />
There's a lot more, but these are just simple quality of life changes.<br />
<br />
No one likes a stalled game for 4 hours anymore, and the only PvP that happens is melee afking while the range barrage and blizzard. This change to the events might encourage more mounting into battle than slow and steady turtle pushes.<br />
<br />
Edit: As far as the Gladiator change goes, we need more changes like this. World PvP was killed by NPC Guards. Less guards, more pvp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That is exactly what I see here too. Alliance takes main raid, horde the events. When alliance killed the horde leader then half of them leave and the rest has to regroup and run to events where 100% of the horde are already waiting. That ends up with an alliance defeat almost every single time....and after the first defeat they do not even really try anymore.<br />
<br />
I don't see any new serious incentive for the horde to go main road now. Yes, maybe they gonna be a bit more challenged at the events...but as long as 90% of the horde run events and 90% of the alliance run main road it does not help if 10% swap from main road to events and vice versa(they get beaten anyway and then return to their old task again). You'd have to have everyone change their mind at the same time to cause a serious change to the meta...and that ain't going to happen without serious incentives.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I would also like to know if you have to have all the Garrosh heirlooms for the level 1 mount.<br />
<br />
The answer to that one is a big fat &quot;NO&quot;. Getting those heirlooms was purely luck based and hardly anyone has them all. Not to mention that you can't optain them anymore. Given that people already complain about the fishing thing(which is easy to get if you got 2 or 3 friends), this would make people freak out...;-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
So far the achievements are for 1, 5, 15 and 35 heirlooms. There's about 38, not including rings or Garrosh weapons, so I'd wager 35 would be the one that gives the mount.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've tried explaining it in a calm way to a general chat on alliance but all of them just want to farm main road. And even when we get INSIDE their base none of the fucking horde are there because guess what? THEYRE DOING EVENTS FFS. Alliance will literally sit in their base for 20 or so minutes just to wait for volrath to spawn and then do it all over again. For fuck sake, this is a change for the better but I know damn well alliance isnt going to change their ways.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redecle</div><div class="date">2015-01-28, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What?! 30 min Ashran reset.. Why? Why? Why?<br />
Now it takes even longer to do.<br />
30 minute minimum queue first, possible 1 hour queue and then almost everytime 30 minute reset timer on top of that.<br />
It take literally less than a minute to kill the boss so the reset timer is always on..<br />
<br />
So 1-2 hours of waiting just to cap daily box, why?<br />
How does that help the loosing faction?<br />
Or the winning faction, doing the side events is pointless if you're the winning faction since you can cap conquest just by doing the boss everyday once, getting those extra cq points from events is pointless cause they go over cap, that you'll be doing anyway for epic item chance from the box.<br />
<br />
I don't see the point in capping conquest within an hour for the week, cause i'll be doing the boss for the epic chance anyway, that's just waste of overspill cq points.<br />
<br />
And pvp? Joke, there's no pvp in Ashran, only people capping cq and epic box.<br />
There's no pvp in random bgs, only geared people annihilating beginners and less geared.<br />
Only pvp happens in rated and wargames.<br />
<br />
so only thing this change achieved was that it made people waste their time inside Ashran base instead of Stormshield or garrison.</div></div><hr />

I don't see any new serious incentive for the horde to go main road now. Yes, maybe they gonna be a bit more challenged at the events...but as long as 90% of the horde run events and 90% of the alliance run main road it does not help if 10% swap from main road to events and vice versa(they get beaten anyway and then return to their old task again). You'd have to have everyone change their mind at the same time to cause a serious change to the meta...and that ain't going to happen without serious incentives.<br />

Take a page from AV's playbook. The boss can't be downed without your faction winning some number of side events first -- maybe 3 to expose the boss to attacks. <br />
<br />
Then in the UI, highlight the section of the zone map which has event, and put a glowing outline around the next event's area. <br />
<br />
I think you would get big zergs to the relevant events and then an attempt to regroup in the center for a push on the boss.</div></div><hr />

Ashran is the next AV. It will be nerfed and reduced to hell, because for whatever reason, Alliance cannot team up, work out strategies, and only know The Zerg. Blizzard will remove the side quests and everything going on to try and force the fight in the middle, and just like AV, the Alliance will run right past them to zerg to the Horde base. It's all they know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In essence, when the middle battle is up both factions will (should want to) do it. And when one of the leaders gets killed, both factions will do events. <br />
<br />
It works fine.<br />
<br />
Good to know, I'd be surprised to see horde break off of doing events, they will probably just double their efforts to hold all of the event locations and run the same rounds. If that happens it will be basically only nerfing alliance conquest.</div></div><hr />

Yesterday I was in Ashran on horde. We were dpsing the main boss and everyone fled the instant the event announcement popped up. Someone yelled &quot;EVENT UP&quot; and that was it. We were literally about to &quot;win&quot; and no one cared at all. After that, the entire horde raid sat at whatever event they guessed was next, regardless of whether fighting the road fight was a better idea for that time. They wouldn't even leave to kill rares, right next to the event. It was ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
besides, you get much worth for you time for doing the side events.. you get more honor from artifacts/mini bosses and ofc by far more conquest points for completing the events. oh its not near as repetitive as the non stop combat on the road.</div></div><hr />

There is no nerf to horde or alliance here. It's the player mindset that is mostly ruining Ashran. I'm not saying Ashran is perfect but the players are what make me hate it the most</div></div><hr />

Yes, because the horde are world famous for their superior tactics. I thought this faction fan boi stuff died out years ago?<br />
<br />
<br />
These ashran changes are horrid. On Dreanor EU, as a horde I could get a lot of conquest from doing the objectives but now not worth my time.</div></div><hr />

I am truly expecting Holinka to lose his job before this expansion is over. The fail, it is epic.</div></div><hr />

I say horde because that is the group of players that have become accustomed and attached to the event cycle. If that's alliance in your region, just swap the words. Alliance won't be able to immediately reclaim the events and they will probably be horde favored for some time simply due to muscle memory of all players.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrile</div><div class="date">2015-01-29, 09:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm starting to realize - they won't make any big changes in Ashran. They'll just try to salvage it by enforcing rules with negative impact over everyone.<br />
<br />
Yep. This is about how it will work. They will keep making these little annoying changes and never fix the bigger problem.. then in a few months, they will say they decided that it is too late in the expansion to make major changes and they plan on concentrating on the next expansion.<br />
<br />
The sad part is, this was predictable. If you give a way for BOTH sides to win quickly, that is what they are going to do. Horde takes the outside, Alliance takes the middle. This is exactly what happened with Tol Borad when they made it so only the capturing side got a lot of CP and you barely got any CP if you won by defending.. Horde and Alliance just swapped wins. If your team was defending, chat was filled with people telling you to let the alliance win, and then come back and take it from them in a couple hours for more CP.<br />
<br />
The problem is they hire this guy from Arena junkies, and everything is designed by all the ´pvp experts´.. and they never realize that the majority of people doing this content do not even want to pvp, they are just there for the rewards. They design stuff with the assumption that players want to ´battle it out´ when in fact most of the players in there are more than happy to spend 30-60 mins without ever seeing an enemy player. Alliance does pve in the middle, Horde does pve on the outside and everyone gets rewarded.<br />
<br />
Instead of having all the pvp experts designing this crap, they should at least have some people who hate pvp telling them how it is actually going to work on a live server. If you want it to feel like world pvp, then you can´t allow any way for both sides to win by pveing.<br />

<br />
That really is the sad part, because it is true. They will need to nerf the rewards from the side events, in which case horde and alliance will run right past each other to try to down the enemy boss.<br />
<br />
You cannot force pvp if there is an objective that doesn´t require pvp. The majority of players in AV never die, and never kill another player.</div></div><hr />
