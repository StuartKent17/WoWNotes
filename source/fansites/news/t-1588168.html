Garrison Missions and Raid Loot Rewards<br />
Garrison missions (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/missions?filter-search=raid&amp;filter-lvl-min=100) that reward raid loot will take time to unlock, as you have to gear up your followers before they can start raiding. These missions reward raid loot from a difficulty one above the one you are currently running. Mythic raiders get mythic loot and &lt;span class=&quot;money-gold&quot; alt=&quot;g&quot;&gt;1,000&lt;/span&gt;. There are currently 4 missions for each raid difficulty, with a 2 week cooldown on each. <br />

<br />
Garrison Missions and Followers<br />
Off the top of my head, I'm really not sure what can be done to make the level 100 follower endgame more interesting.<br />
Once you have followers at ilvl 615, the second tier of level 100 missions unlocks, at 630 the third tier unlocks (includes missions with ilvl 645 gear for your character), and when you have followers at ilvl 645 the fourth tier unlocks.<br />
<br />
The fourth tier is special in that they show up rarely, but they're raid missions for your followers that reward your character with raid quality loot of a tier higher than you're currently running. If you're doing LFR, you'll get normal quality raid loot, if you're running normal raids you'll get heroic quality loot, and heroic raiders will get mythic quality loot. Mythic raiders will get mythic loot and 1k gold.<br />
<br />
These missions show up rarely enough that you won't be able to deck out your character in these items before the next raid zone shows up, but having a handful of them will give you a nice edge.<br />
<br />
For the love of the Light, if we have a limited size army (the size limit makes no sense in the context of making a fortress in a savage world), can you soften the blow of people who have become attached to their followers by sending them to Stormwind for rest and relaxation, relocating them to an outpost (where they look pretty and don't do much), or something? &quot;Dismiss&quot; sounds very harsh and final (and makes the commander out to be a complete jerk for abandoning loyal followers to the savage enviroment).<br />
Yes we can. We're removing the concept of dismissing followers and instead changing to a limit of 20 active-duty followers that can go on missions. What that means is, if you're over 20 active followers, you won't be able to start a mission until you're down to 20 active-duty followers. Your followers that are on inactive duty still show up in your UI (but marked as inactive), and don't lose any levels, progress, etc. One follower per day can be returned from inactive duty for 250g.<br />
<br />
The nature of the tuning here is such that it's absolutely not going to impact any sort of cutting-edge progression racing during the early days/weeks of a new tier. It's more of a helping hand later on. And because the availability of these missions depends on your character's actual raiding progression, they aren't replacing or trivializing the importance of actually going into raids and killing bosses.<br />
<br />
Without getting into exact numbers, being classified as a &quot;Heroic raider&quot; or &quot;Mythic raider&quot; or the like requires multiple weeks of experience in a given zone at a given difficulty. And if you're worried about the impact on gearing up for the next tier, an occasional chance at a random Mythic piece pales in comparison to the dozens of Mythic items your farm clears will be bringing in every week, with the ability to trade items around and target specific drops through bonus rolls. This will be a drop in the bucket by comparison.<br />
<br />
Garrison missions (or lack thereof) aren't going to impact any sort of world-first or realm-first competitions. But this system does help keep the system relevant to a broader range of players, and as overall gear levels improve over the course of a tier.<br />

Classes<br />
Reminder: It's very hard for you to have much perspective about how under/overpowered your spec is on Beta.Buffs/Nerfs are good, not bad. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/506970091892641793))<br />
<br />
why are unpopular or disliked talents not being removed or made baseline(in a weaker from)? There could be something better ther<br />
Because making them baseline is how we end up with bloat. We'd rather improve them than remove; they can still work. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/506886917070147584))<br />
<br />
what's the point of Resolve?I get Vengeance-&gt;Dmg-&gt;Threat(glad that's gone btw).But why &quot;getting attacked&quot;-&gt;&quot;better at survival&quot;?<br />
So that absolute effects and percentage effects stay competitive (ie Shield Barrier vs Shield Block). (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/506906790169022464))<br />

Seal of Justice is currently doing 2% less direct damage than SoT on beta and doesn't proc damage on Judgment. Intentional?<br />
Intentional that it Judgment doesn't trigger it (see Burden of Guilt). Unintentional that it's less direct damage than Truth. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/506930759009976320))<br />

Why make empowered seals when you guys got rid of warrior stance dancing? just means Paladins are now going to be Seal dancing.<br />

Character / Items<br />
I'm curious to know how much work it would take to make raid tier tokens function like Timeless Isle gear tokens. cc: @WatcherDev<br />
They will work that way in Warlords. No more vendors - you can get your set piece on the spot. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/506582668600147968))<br />
So if two warlock tiers drop and there's only one warlock will that other piece go to waste?<br />
It'd still be a Conqueror token that drops. A priest, paladin, or warlock could loot and use it to transform it into their item. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/507057737688449024))<br />
<br />
for a druid u could do 10hr duration and no cd and still would be worthless.<br />
This should be fixed in 6.0 with the new transform system! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/506261343755042816))<br />
Does that apply to Shaman &amp; ghost wolf as well? I love my Iron boot flask but losing the effect if I want to GW is no fun.<br />
Yes (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/506333800591527938))<br />
<br />
Will SoO gear still be upgradeable after 6.0? message would seem to indicate that.<br />
Yes, your Mists gear will remain upgradeable. Draenor gear won't be. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/506890882260275200))<br />

PvP<br />
Yo bruh. is there any new battlegrounds for WoD?<br />
Initially we're focused on making Ashran a great PvP experience at launch (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/506952842150563841))<br />
<br />
there was some horrible fps lag issue in ashran last time I played it<br />
We're doing a lot of optimization work on Ashran (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/506953029577240576))<br />
<br />
chance for a pvp rare in Steel Strongboxes feels too high. Like 40-50% too high.<br />
Do you mean like you're getting gear too fast or too much of the gear you don't want? (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/507231059595902976))<br />
getting gear too fast. Every second box contains a rare pvp item.<br />

Garrisons<br />
Are Garrisons Faction bound? (Do I keep the Garrison I made on horde if I go Alli? Viseversa)<br />
You keep your garrison, and get the horde's version of the followers you acquired (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/506333886692196352))<br />
<br />
yeah it would be nice to know if it is just Beta inflation or if that is the plan for Live<br />

Misc<br />
is Iron Docks' geometry still broken in this build, or will we be able to access it again?<br />
There are (were) two copies of the dungeon present, superimposed. Turns out the game gets really confused when we do that. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/507003386546245632))<br />

We looked at the Warlock Tier 17 armor sets (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4291-Tier-17-Warlock-Armor-Sets-Final-Gaze-of-the-Black-Prince-Blue-Tweets-CM-Boss-Solo) and a monk solo video of Armsmaster Harlan.<br />

There was a new beta build<br />
<br />
Tier tokens can be used by a player to get the correct item for their spec, similar to Timeless Isle tokens.<br />
After Patch 6.0, item upgrades will cost 50 Lesser Charms, items that were sold for Justice Points will be sold for gold, Valor Points will be gone, and Warforged Seals will no longer have a weekly cap. <br />
The spacegoat (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/august/spacegoatLiterallyASpacegoat.jpg) pet (Karabor Kid (http://beta.wowdb.com/npcs/88807-karabor-kid)) will be a Battle.Net Shop item.<br />

I was thinking about how awesome it'd be if you could earn an actual pack of hearthstone cards from WoW, say like having a weekly quest or something.</div></div><hr />

You can get a CHANCE at single random piece of mythic loot (and a bit of gold) every two weeks starting a couple of months into the tier. Unless you're one of those &quot;if there's a .05% chance that it will give me an upgrade it's mandatory!&quot; people, you're better off just raiding if you're in hc. It's actually -least- useful for mythic mode raiders in terms of upgrades, because chances are good you'll have already filled that slot in your actual raid.<br />
<br />
It'll be more useful for the casual raiders, who can get a piece from a raid a level higher than they're currently running and will be much more likely to find the piece to actually be an upgrade, and not the same item level as what they have.</div></div><hr />

It's one of Blizzards biggest mistakes of the last years(aside from that bad Diablo release and the slow reaction on ghost servers) to not have transformed WoW into a games platform. Hearthstone, a Plants vs. Zombies-clone(or license), the LoL-clone, Warcraft 3....all of them directly playable right from WoW. They could even have built a new town called &quot;Azeroth's Vas Legas&quot; where you can play all of Blizz games(Starcraft, Diablo) on gnomish machines....all of that without of having a large impact on WoW as a game or lore. Essentially WoW could have been a MMORPG and Steam in one platform(sure you would still have to be able to get into these games without of playing WoW. It would just have been a bonus and you'd be able to play and chat with the guild etc.).<br />
Then they could have made discount prices for WoW-players on those games cause they anyway pay a monthly fee...and that in turn would have encouraged more players to keep playing WoW.<br />
<br />
I don't know if they have been not smart enough or just been too coward to make that move...but that's how it is when a company gets too big and is looking more at the money they can make in the next 6 months than the next 10 years.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, what scenario lead to them feeling it needed a one third reduction in damage. Am I missing something that significant?</div></div><hr />

The blue post says &quot;you won't be able to deck out your character in these items before the next raid zone shows up, but having a handful of them will give you a nice edge&quot;<br />
<br />
So this isn't intended to be some 0.5% droprate. This is intended to be something where grinding Garrisons will get you at least one or two pieces.<br />
<br />
Now multiply that up by a 20 person Mythic team, plus bench.<br />
<br />
That'd be at least 20-40 pieces of gear from Garrisons, and from the way Kalgan is talking it could be much more.<br />
<br />
If you're at the top end of Mythic progression, you're not going to be able to risk not getting an upgrade. If you're scraping to clear on Mythic you definitely won't be able to risk missing out on that much raid loot.<br />
<br />
I doubt Bliz is aiming for &quot;don't worry, you'll never get loot &amp; if you do it won't be useful&quot;.<br />
<br />
It's no different from having top-end PVE upgrades available through PVP (or vice versa). When they brought in Pet Battles, Pet Battling content rewarded you with Pet Battle related items. Why are Garrisons the special flower that have to shove their tentacles into everything else?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Chances are if you require Garrisons to get you gear for Mythic/Heroic a few months into a current tier, You aren't a Mythic/Heroic raider. Thus your anger towards it is completely fucking retarded and you should stop whinging like a child.<br />

People that are actual MYTHIC RAIDERS should have content down by the time you can even get pieces from Garrisons. If not, well bad news you aren't a Mythic player.<br />

...I'm sure that if you are a proper HC raider, you will have that gear long before those missions become available to everyone else. But, as usual, people gotta complain.</div></div><hr />

rng can screw up anyone - i know a hunter who got his hc sha trinket after 8 months of farming hc sha long after we killed garosh hc (granted main cause was 10 man loot ) - so by your definition he is not hc raider cause rng screwed him and he actually needed that pieces of loot ? same can happen with any slot for anyone -rng is a biatch</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BigWeather</div><div class="date">2014-09-08, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A couple of things I wonder about the missions:<br />
<br />
1) Will they &quot;drop&quot; tier gear? As a LFR raider with no intention of going to Normal it'd be great if I could get a shot at tier gear again for transmog purposes<br />
2) Once the next raid zone is out can I still send my followers on missions in the prior zone (to eventually fill out that tier transmog set)?</div></div><hr />

I spent an hour this afternoon in my game trying to fix a bug where a light kept flickering where it shouldn´t have been.. after an hour of moving dozens of lights and a ton of items.. turns out I had accidentally duped a piece of terrain, and the second copy was catching some light at a bad angle.<br />
<br />
As soon as I read the dev post about garrison loot, I knew someone would immediately ´cry´ about garrisons being mandatory for heroic progression. People just have no concept of percentages or timing.. Please stop crying about bring forced to do garrisons or LFR for mythic raiding... if you can get an upgrade from garrisons or LFR before you have stuff on farm... you are not a mythic raider.</div></div><hr />

If you managed to down HC Garrosh without the Trinket from 8 months prior, how would that gear be necessary, since when is gear for Farming mandatory.<br />

hurr.</div></div><hr />

If you're a top end mythic raider you.....<br />
<br />
1. Wouldn't be taking the time to whine about something so insignificant here.<br />
<br />
2. Would realize that crap will be on farm long before you even have the option to do this in your garrison.<br />
<br />
3. LOL at how everyone seems to be a top end mythic raider on these forums.</div></div><hr />

I very very very much doubt they will. I mean, that would be really stupid from a business stand point:<br />
<br />
Sell packs for real money, or sell packs for easy to obtain (and really cheap) in game currency...its a no brainer if you ask me.<br />
<br />
This is something cosmetic, and nothing more. If 10g gives you a Hearthstone pack, it would be the dumbest business decision Blizzard made yet</div></div><hr />

Ya selling ti for 10 gold would be immensely stupid. But what about 1000g? Seems like there is a gold amount you could throw onto it to make it work. Would be difficult to find a good spot to bring some players in while not killing profits. Something more like a weekly quest would probably work better.</div></div><hr />
