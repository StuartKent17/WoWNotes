<br />
Thank you. Someone who shares an opinion of mine that these should have been available at launch.<br />
<br />
Hell the Legion 4 should have been anyway for now. And they could just add these throughout the expansion or save them until 9.0.<br />
<br />
But nah lets timegate one of the core pieces of content in WoW....</div></div><hr />

Shouldn't be surprised, since I think you needed the first half of the War Campaign for Dark Iron and Mag'har. Can't be bothered to log in and check.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's the core content of an MMORPG like this. So no it's content.<br />
<br />
And considering they have backstory and their own special racial abilities yes it's most certainly content.</div></div><hr />

I doubt we will hear about next ones before Summer and 8.2.5 PTR. We may hear some rumors or datamining though (like with Alpaca mount and Mechagon in the future).</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not a broken promise. Every allied race required a reputaiton and a questline. Dark Iron and Mag'har required War campaign also. The only promise was that they won't require any new faction introduced in a new patch. And it was just an answer for the question because the reputation grind is the gate behind all other allied races, not the questline, questline can be done usualy quickly.<br />
<br />
Ion admitted in the Q&amp;A that those races should be at launch but they had to delay it because Kul Tirans aren't just a reskin. They are full new race with a custom rig and animations and that takes a lot of time to make.</div></div><hr />

(It'll be the same with flying, where everybody will be busy with Nazjatar and no one will care about KT ou Zandalar anymore, except for archeology/farming and Mechagon)</div></div><hr />

Too bad that they are halfassed anyway, so why did they bother in the first place is a question for the ages.</div></div><hr />

We all know why it's the way it is.<br />
<br />
Boosts, Race changes and to keep people subbed. No other reasons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i fail to see the problem here. if you haven't done any content story-wise up to this point, you most certainly haven't done it on horde and / or alliance. so you didn't touch the story on ANY character.<br />
<br />
if looked at from your account perspective, where we try to emerge ourselves in some light rpg and think that our account is made up of several characters from both factions hiding in two different bases on the fictional world of azeroth, we now nothing of both the zandalarians or the kul tirans. we aren't accustomed to their cities, to their way of life. we don't know who is in power, we have no flight paths for further exploration, et cetera. and suddenly you expect our small garrison to have a foreigner enter the compound, being a zandalarian paladin or a kul tiran hunter? how could we justify that?<br />
<br />
so, all in all: if you aren't one bit interested in the war campaign, the main BfA point, why should you reap the rewards? hell, those quests are done in a few hours and you'd have to actively avoid reputation gains with the required factions in order to not meet the criteria. the criteria being &quot;please play the game JUST. A. BIT.&quot;.<br />
<br />
really, please don't say stuff like that.</div></div><hr />

I was using sarcasm to convey the idea that Blizzard would never charge to access something you can get in game over time, which they most definitely will at some point and people are going crack cocaine over allied races so it seems like the perfect way to do it, or maybe make it a part of their season pass they are implementing.</div></div><hr />

Want the regular human body at all times with the kul tiran accents/racials (one of my pet peeves as a worgen is having to macro /cast Two Forms whenever I /cancelform). <br />

What they really said was no new requirements, meaning that you can complete all that is required today already, and most people that played BfA actively will already have it completed. So on the day the patch releases, you can just do the short story quest to unlock them, and make a character.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And considering they have backstory and their own special racial abilities yes it's most certainly content.<br />
<br />
I can't quite wrap my head around it, I know it's probably just me, but:<br />
<br />
Do the story of Kul Tiras as your main character.<br />
<br />
Unlock Kul Tirans.<br />
<br />
Go back to content where Kul Tiras is completely cut off from the world, and play in content that is in the past, and in a world where there are no Kul Tirans running around.<br />
<br />
Level up to the content where the story is you playing as an outsider, learning about Kul Tirans, and helping re-unite the houses of Kul Tiras...as a Kul Tiran...doesn't the whole Alliance story play out as you being introduced as an outsider by that female NPC? (That's what I recall from watching videos.)<br />
<br />
It kind of feels cosmetic to me. Being a Kul Tiran doesn't change the story at all, you're still you, playing in a different skin. It's not content. Content would be quests and activities playing from the point of view as a Kul Tiran. <br />
<br />
But, there's no way they could do it right, except make them a choice from day one, and have a starting zone at 110 that's a Kul Tiran exclusive storyline, that skips the majority of the Alliance campaign, so you can jump into the plot as a Kul Tiran who's now in the Alliance. Which will never happen. But would be fantastic. I'd resub to try something like that. Same for Zandalar - no interest in resubbing and have to level a horde alt all the way, to unlock them, to do it again, with the same disconnect from lore and story, playing as a Zandalar in content that hasn't seen any, or is at war with them, like in Pandaria. <br />
<br />
It's getting to the point they need to stop forcing players into story and content that makes no sense for the race. It's so convoluted and dumb now. Allied races should start at the level of the content they're released into, and they should have their own start zones and stories, like Draeni, Blood Elves, Goblins, Worgen, Death Knights, Pandas, and Demon Hunters got. This current iteration makes no sense, it's not content, it's purely cosmetic in my mind. <br />
<br />
And it's just a godawful mess, lore-wise, from a player perspective.</div></div><hr />

Mate the story has been a disjointed mess since Mists at least. But at least Mists had some coherency.<br />
<br />
Allied Races in general are just trash. They should have been available from launch. The Legion 4 anyway. This whole &quot;lore&quot; and &quot;earning their trust&quot; shit is just a crappy way to timegate it. Nothing more or less.<br />
<br />
The unlock quests when you get the requirements done are trash too. Just a glorified scenario then they are all like &quot;FOR TEH ALLIANCE/HORDE&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Anyone who thinks the Allied Race system isn't about selling those £19 race changes or AAA game priced boosts is flat out lying to themselves.<br />

you do know undercover cops do that all the time right? they allow minor crimes and sometimes even larger crimes be commited if that means they are able to capture as many people as possible, and get them for the crime you are sent to get them for.<br />

<br />
Speaking from my own perspective one of the things that made legion for me was being a demon hunter it felt thematic and did a lot for how much I got into the expansion and it really isnt that different with zandalari for me. As much as I loved DH after Z trolls were announced at blizzcon I literally decided what classes I was going to play based off the preliminary info wowhead on these races (dodged a bullet with warlock). I ended up settling on rogue and I've been a place holder race (belf) for the last 7 months.....<br />
<br />
None of you playing right now would enjoy the game to same degree (if you're enjoying it at all rn) if your main was a race you didn't enjoy, if the race you were looking forward to being at launch was swapped with brown orcs for *story reasons*, if the race you were looking forward to that was demo'd at blizzcon 2017 was being released in 2019, if the race you wanted to be was delayed because its faction counterpart wasn't ready yet, and then the first time blizzard says anything new regarding that race its a bunch of information specifying the unlock requirements you finished months ago....<br />
<br />
There are so many things wrong with BFA and I've had to overlook a lot of it to make it this far but I guess they cant be too far out now if they put this video up right? RIGHT??</div></div><hr />

Hard to be hyped for races that are timegated.<br />
<br />
Imagine being a new player. You get told at least 5 of the races added to this game you can go play to your hearts content. But if you want the other 6 (soon to be 8) you have to jump through hoops.<br />
<br />
There is literally zero reason to make Allied Races timegated, rep gated or any other form of gate. They should be available to play the minute they are ready on the character selection screen just like the races added before them.<br />
<br />
All they've done is take a core feature of the game and put it behind a stupid timegate in an effort to hope people will be too lazy to level them and will pay for race changes and boosts. Nothing more or less. There is absolutely no reason they can't just be on the select screen like the other races when they are ready to roll out. <br />
<br />
And heh the video has the majority of dislikes out of 5k total. 3.3k</div></div><hr />

because instead of making 1-2 races they are making fucking 10, that is why, because at the cost of having to you know PLAY THE GAME you get DOUBLE the amount of races before.<br />

derek most likely already is a pawn of sylvanas.<br />
and letting him actually do it means the rest of the horde will get along side you, tricking baine into doing it will cause the other leaders to distrust sylvanas, as it was not really baine doing it, but you tricking him into doing so.<br />
derek is already mind controlled i am sure of it. so he is right where she wants him.</div></div><hr />

To me. It sounds like they are gonna be released seperatly from the new raid &gt;.&gt; Still, Give us a fucking release date blizz! For fucking sake!<br />
<br />
They will release with the launch of 8.1.5 which is comign soon, the new raid will be coming long after that.<br />
<br />
btw the last raid literally just came out...<br />
the final wing of lfr is not even out yet.<br />

I don't personally get the timegating thing as anyone who's played the game for the last month should have all these unlocked for their respective faction, however those who unsubbed due to zandalari taking quite a while to come out I can see their frustration. Had I known in august that not only would zandalari come with patch 8.1.5 as opposed to 8.1 but both patches would take considerably longer than their respective legion counterparts I might've skipped on this too.</div></div><hr />

Boosts, Race changes and to keep people subbed. No other reasons. <br />
<br />
They'll be released when they need the revenue boost for the quarterly so they can first and foremost keep their investors happy, or at least show numbers that look good, All content deliberately delayed and put on hold until they realy need it for those numbers..................it's just business , fck the customers they can wait 'we'll just keep baiting them' :p</div></div><hr />

It’s something to do when I’m bored I suppose, which is often. Though I’m not a fan of modern leveling and the only heritage armor I actually use it the Mag’har one. <br />
<br />
At least it’s a good way to gradually amass an army of monks to do the yearly love is in the air dungeon with though. 25 111+ alts and counting.</div></div><hr />

Well yeah, The raid just came out, I doubt they would release the new raid while the one that was just released still hasn't released the final wing of LFR. Considering that the Raid testing for the new raid begins I believe it said either the 25th or 28th of this month, So It does sound like they are being released and the raid is to be time gated for about a month. Still doesn't mean I am Happy. They should atleast give us a release date for the patch. It would chill everyone out, atleast I believe. But the community has become a bunch of entitled dickheads, sooo I doubt it will make everyone happy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't disagree. But even if they weren't timegated, with the poor state of the racials and the kul'tiran models, male or especially female it's hard to get hyped for them regardless of when they would be released. I'm sure it's a different topic for a different thread, but the amount of effort they've put into races that almost no one on the Alliance wants seems to be a continuing and disheartening trend. At least the Zandalari look pretty wicked though. Just my 2 cents of course.</div></div><hr />

Not everyone cares about the heritage armour, most of it is low effort crap anyway. As for the other races? they arguably pale in comparison to the above - passive effects are most of the time better than actives. Especially that Kul'Tiran one... tanks that heal just off being hit? total no brain ability, depending on how much of the damage heals, thats potentially the new best tank race.</div></div><hr />

I could see these skins being VERY important to the RP crowd. I personally don't get it, but that's fine - and doesn't negate why it's important to other players.</div></div><hr />

Yep. They could have easily had these Allied Races just there on the character select screen. And just kept adding them in patches/expansions.<br />
<br />
But of course timegating them and making them start at a lower level = more money from boosts/race changes. Pitiful if I'm honest.</div></div><hr />

Its just sometimes on these forums it doesn't take much before people start to throw around terms like shill and white knight.<br />

I have a host of complaints, especially in the timegating, profession and general character progression department but for me the end all be all for WoW has always been the quality of the dungeons and raids and Blizzard despite their short comings have for the most part managed to be somewhat consistent in the quality of their dungeons and raids.</div></div><hr />

To me a white knight is someone who valiantly defends their product and acts if it can do no wrong. Simple as that really. You actually said the game has flaws and you've listed your complaints. You acknowledge the issues at least.<br />
<br />
All the complaints you listed are actually the same ones I have on top of the Allied Race one. On top of how they handle the Q and As and communication with us BFA for me was the straw that broke the camels back.<br />
<br />
I don't want Blizzard to fail god no. But they need to get their backside in gear and start making an experience that's enjoyable all round again imo. Not in patch 8.2 or patch 9.2 but when they launch the damn expansion.</div></div><hr />

Yeah the only really semi decent heritage armor imo is HM Tauren. And maybe Mag'har Orcs.<br />
<br />
Lightforged Draenei is pathetic. It's literally the Unsullied/Combatant armor from Legion but it looks a tiny bit better, Nightborne is meh, Void Elf is just pathetic, Kul Tiran is so-so, Zandalari has barely any effort to it whatsoever and looks like questing greens and Dark Iron looks like a Firelands set that only a mother could love.<br />
<br />
There was barely any effort put into the heritage armor designs imo. I mean why do they need to when people just boost/race change them?</div></div><hr />

Exactly, some of them are 'ok' most of them are literally just an incentive/selling point for people to go back into the grind and ultimately pay for more sub time hence the leveling nerfs, remember when they said they nerfed leveling because they felt it was too fast? thats why, all about the $$$$$$$$ - that's also why they're keeping WoWToken gold prices lower, they have full control over them yet keep them low because they know they increase their overall revenue because people end up paying more for gold over time, it's a total rip off.</div></div><hr />

Good point. I don't play or follow games like that, but the reward structure for games like Fortnight are all cosmetic, right?<br />
<br />
People like and want LOTS of things I don't care about, it's not my place to deny them. I don't get allied races personally, and if I were still playing, I probably would never unlock them, but that doesn't mean other people can't care, or shouldn't.</div></div><hr />

The Alliance must gain the trust of the Draenei by cleansing the temple of Illidan and the Fel Orcs, gain exhalted with the Ashtongue Deathsworn, The Exodar and complete all atunements. <br />

The Horde must gain the trust of the Blood Elves by Kill Kael'Thas in Tempest Keep, gain exhalted with Silvermoon, Tranquillien and complete all atunements for Tempest Keep<br />

<br />
Imagine being a new player. You get told at least 5 of the races added to this game you can go play to your hearts content. But if you want the other 6 (soon to be 8) you have to jump through hoops.<br />
<br />
There is literally zero reason to make Allied Races timegated, rep gated or any other form of gate. They should be available to play the minute they are ready on the character selection screen just like the races added before them.<br />
<br />
All they've done is take a core feature of the game and put it behind a stupid timegate in an effort to hope people will be too lazy to level them and will pay for race changes and boosts. Nothing more or less. There is absolutely no reason they can't just be on the select screen like the other races when they are ready to roll out. <br />
<br />
And heh the video has the majority of dislikes out of 5k total. 3.3k<br />
<br />
There’s actually a pretty good reason to make them gated. The wow team wants to add more races but it isn’t worth the cost so by putting in things like time gating they can go to who ever does the books and tell them that it wouldn’t be a complete waste of resources. Just adding new races to the select screen cost money and gets them like nothing and just like pre lfr raids is Proabbly hard to justify.<br />
<br />

Hasn’t that been every race ever added?<br />

This is the biggest time gate blizzard ever done i think.<br />

<br />
For zandalari sure but not for the fat humans as they were actually still indevolpment.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Yep. They could have easily had these Allied Races just there on the character select screen. And just kept adding them in patches/expansions.<br />
<br />
But of course timegating them and making them start at a lower level = more money from boosts/race changes. Pitiful if I'm honest.<br />
<br />
They couldn’t have had them start on day one as fat humans weren’t done on day one.<br />
<br />
Also every single race starts at a low level are you really complaing the new ones start 19 levels higher then every other one now?</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, because if your Race is available day 1, you can level it from the first day of the expac, be ready to do dungeons/raid directly.<br />
<br />
With the Races being released 6 months in, in the middle of one tier, the only choice is race swap / level boost if you don't want to be left behind in terms of progress (especially now we have grindy bullshit like Artifact weapons/neck, every week you miss is an important downgrade).</div></div><hr />

I don't think what he said is comparable to what we got from allied races... different concepts and there are more of AR, even if they are &quot;recolors&quot; they have different racials, jokes, flitrs and I think (don't know) dances, that makes them different enough.<br />
<br />
There are way more important stuff to be salty about BFA that blizzard saying since some months ago that they would come in 8.1.5 and even explained why it happened, lies or not, that's better than nothing.<br />
<br />
If I were blizzard, I'll would make cry more these manchildren that cry so much but still are going to play these races, by saying &quot;oh, it seems that you really don't wat them seeing the stupid dislike ratio, ok, no kul'tirans and zandalari, maybe later, bye bitches, cry me a river!&quot; oh man, I could eat so much popcorn out of that.<br />

Yeah good point. Ion did actually lie out of his teeth about them. I remember reading after a Q and A or sometime around that you only needed the war campaign done.<br />
<br />
Nice to know they were being dishonest by leaving out the other method.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry if I'm being harsh here but they have spread quite a lot of information, people who really cared about it know it all, the only thing you are right is that they have changed stuff of what they said, but when they changed it they have said so and even apologised.<br />

Mate the story has been a disjointed mess since Mists at least. But at least Mists had some coherency.<br />
<br />
Allied Races in general are just trash. They should have been available from launch. The Legion 4 anyway. This whole &quot;lore&quot; and &quot;earning their trust&quot; shit is just a crappy way to timegate it. Nothing more or less.<br />
<br />
The unlock quests when you get the requirements done are trash too. Just a glorified scenario then they are all like &quot;FOR TEH ALLIANCE/HORDE&quot;.<br />

Not a good reason sorry. You just basically confirmed that allied races intent is profit driven. So again they've taken what used to be a core feature and basically timegated it in this whole obsession with profits/MAU&gt;enjoyable experience. <br />
<br />
Also the level thing is a bad argument. You can start the game at 55 since DK had their restriction removed. 19 more levels hurts nothing. You can literally have a 98 character by playing 15 levels of the game.<br />
<br />
Also don't split hairs. You know damn well I didn't mean these races on day 1. They could have saved the Legion allied races for day 1 and then added others through patches/expansions.</div></div><hr />

The Zandalari and the Horde immediately committed acts of war on to the Alliance by nearly burning Stormwind down, killing their soldiers, engaging with Jaina as well as destroying the pursing ships all before stepping foot on Zandalar. Once on Zandalar, they give us their prestigious golden temple and port as a staging area which allows us to make incursions in to Alliance territory while the Alliance are doing the same on to their land. We kill Ghu'un as well as Zul and essentially clean up the mess made by King Rastakhan and they're still undecided.<br />

It's absolutely incredible that it takes a full on invasion followed by the death of Rastakhan for them to realize which side they're on.</div></div><hr />

shadowmeld is interrupted by ANY DAMAGE too, didnt stop rogues and druids from using it in arena for their advantage, didnt stop any night elf in open world PVE AND PVP to not take huge advantage of it.<br />

this ANY DAMAGE you speak of can easily be avoided with how classes are designed these days. you dont need the whole 6 seconds of it, nobody is going to use it on 0% of their HP and it doesnt matter if your HP doesnt end up at 100%. I dont want to see some Zanda troll use LoS and recover from 30% hp to 80% in 3 seconds while Im stunned.<br />

I dont want to see the last remaining decent alliance players move their guilds to horde because ever 20 player of the raid can heal to full hp in a phase switch of a bossfight without spending 1 mana.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ion admitted in the Q&amp;A that those races should be at launch but they had to delay it because Kul Tirans aren't just a reskin. They are full new race with a custom rig and animations and that takes a lot of time to make.<br />
<br />
They have had(or atleast should have had) a long time to work on them.<br />
They should've been ready to go at expansion launch despite being a &quot;totally new&quot; race - just like they had older races such as draenei and blood elf ready for their expansion launch.<br />
They can't be totally custom made as atleast male kul tiran uses female pandaren casting animation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You really don't see any difference there ?<br />
<br />
Leveling from scratch in the middle of an expansion (and of a tier), catch-up or not, is a guaranteed few weeks of being behind, because you're behind in reputations, ilvl, probably professions, and artifact.<br />
Leveling from scratch at the beginning of the expac will probably leave you behind a little bit in ilvl (because fewer dungeons, but they award stuff approximately the same ilvl as the end of leveling does), and slightly behind in artifact power too.<br />
<br />
You'll be slightly behind. Slightly. If you suddenly reroll in the middle of a tiers, you lose your raid spot instantly, and you may eventually get it back for the next tier if your guild hasn't replaced you by then.</div></div><hr />

Anyone who thinks the Allied Race system isn't about selling those £19 race changes or AAA game priced boosts is flat out lying to themselves.<br />
<br />
I mean sure FF14 has nowhere as near as many races but at least I don't have to jump through hoops to play as the two they added.<br />
<br />
No other reason, really, to keep the two most hotly awaited races for this long. Make sure the people get gear, and have invested enough in that toon in terms of Necklace and Azerite traits/TF (imagine hoping you get lucky again on a different toon?).<br />
<br />
Nah, easier to pay the money and take the race change. The more I play FF14, the more I see *just* how badly Blizzard handle so many things now, it is quite sickening really.<br />

If it takes you a few weeks to level at launch you would still be behind in Ilvl professions rep ect. The differance is mid or late expan there are really heavy catch ups and if you already have a max level character you can still play with friends unlike if you restart at the start of an expan. <br />
<br />
You also have a good chance of losing your raid spot if you start over as people tend to want people to be raid ready when new raids open so if your still leveling a new character a few weeks after launch why take you and not some one else?<br />

Few things:<br />
- Raids are no longer opened directly, we now have to wait one month to see the first raid open, that's plenty of time to level whatever you want if you're dedicated.<br />
- Even if you level in three days, even with catch-up mechanics, you're still being time-gated by the game itself because of the weekly bullshit. Weekly mythic+ chest, weekly quest/content giving a shitton of azerite, whatever currency cap (valor points / residuum / legion's legendary coins i forgot the name...), weekly lockout on LFR/Raids... So you'll still be behind in terms of power (Azerite, Ilvl), unless your guild is really dedicated to you and decide to split-run just for you.<br />
- I don't really remember how it was implemented for other races, but imo additional races could be available before the expac (pre-patch event) for you to &quot;pre-level&quot; your new chars up to the previous expac level cap so that you can level with your friends/guild.<br />
<br />
Unless you're some kind of 24/7 player with insane amount of friends agreeing to boost you, I have trouble imagining someone being able to level a Zandalari in 8.1.5 and being able to competitively raid in Dazar'alor a few days/weeks later.<br />
On the other hand, I've already seen newly-created characters be able to raid competitively at the beginning of the expac (lots of Pandas did that).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I’d say it comes down to how dedicated you are. At launch your going to be behind even if the raids are delayed and mid tier your going to be behind but you have catch ups. In both cases if you really care you can catch up and be raid ready. If you want to not be behind you really have to just not level a new room either at the start or part way though.<br />
<br />
Races pre allied races also became available at 1 on launch day the pre leveling was just for the legion allied races.</div></div><hr />

Zandalar Forever/A Nation United sounds more like the requirements for flying which makes me wonder what the requirements for flying will be.<br />
<br />
Fair enough, I think flying will need (apart from part one) exalted with the new rep from 8.2 and exploration I think. They said it would be the same as 7.2</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know some people decided not to do any story quests whilst leveling and that it may suck to be them but most people should have the achievements already since it is literally just doing the zone storylines and the culminating quests following.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eduwneso</div><div class="date">2019-02-20, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They have had(or atleast should have had) a long time to work on them.<br />
They should've been ready to go at expansion launch despite being a &quot;totally new&quot; race - just like they had older races such as draenei and blood elf ready for their expansion launch.<br />
They can't be totally custom made as atleast male kul tiran uses female pandaren casting animation.<br />
<br />
The thing is that, despite all the shady MAU things that are happening, we don't know for certain how they allocate resources (developers), when did they, and how much real time they had to make everything that is now in-game. Did they get lazy? not enough resources to develop and debug everything? bad organization of the resources? they just really didn't care? and a large etc of possible reasons.<br />
<br />
The problem resides in one of those, and since we don't know everything that is hapenning there, the best thing we could do as players is reprot politely what we don't like and what we like, as much as some want to think that firing X people would fix everything, it won't, voting with your wallet and at the same time pointing out why are you voting with your wallet, is the optimal way to go, if you care for the people working at the company, if you are not enjoying the game anymore, say why, but say it well, and if you truly don't enjoy it and can't even play it then stop, you are hurting yourself.<br />
<br />
This is just what I think.</div></div><hr />

Dunno about that. Just look at &quot;Old Soldier&quot; and &quot;Lost Honor&quot; - those things are really loved. So was &quot;Terror of Darkshore&quot;. People know what they like and show what they have gotten fed up with (gated content, cash shop mounts, etc).</div></div><hr />

More Q&amp;As than ever that all ultimately said about +- nothing. I don't see a difference between 2 and 12 pointless Q&amp;As per year. Quantity doesn't make up for a lack of quality, especially when that quantity somehow only ever comes into play as some sort of damage control.<br />

<br />
just because they dont answer &quot;HEY BLIZZARD FUCK YOU, WHEN IS ION GUNNA BE FIRED&quot; does not make them bad... every Q&amp;A has had many good questions. maybe not all of them but atleast 3-4<br />
<br />
Lets look at the last Q&amp;A for example since you love to say they answer literally nothing.<br />
<br />
Kul Tiran Humans and Zandalari Trolls<br />
They will release with Patch 8.1.5<br />
You only have to get the war campaign achievement to unlock them, which you obtain before the quest to go into the raid.<br />
They are not available yet because story wise they wanted the events to play out that solidifies them joining the larger fight.<br />
They originally planned to have the Zandalari available with the Dark Iron Dwarves at launch, but replaced them with Mag'har Orcs so that it would make more sense with the flow of the story and to pair them with Kul Tirans.<br />
Kul Tiran humans are an entirely new rig and therefore were more time consuming to create.<br />
War Mode<br />
They don't anticipate the item level 400 reward quest happening every week because there are a lot more Alliance participating in War Mode.<br />
The extra rewards were meant to encourage more Alliance to participate but also to make Horde who did not like PvP to turn it off.<br />
They agree that item level 400 is a little too high at the beginning of a raid tier. It won't be changed this week, but next week if it is available again it will be reduced to 385 and another form of reward will be added, such as war resources.<br />
The War Mode bonus is determined by the amount of players participating on the outnumbered faction. They believe it might drop to 25% next week.<br />
The discrepancy between factions in War Mode has been cut in half since the change.<br />
The team is working on the issues causing the lag in certain War Mode shards.<br />
Character Slots and Alts<br />
They might allow the cap of 50 characters total to all be on the same server.<br />
There might be a way for you to transfer War Resources from your main to your alts in 8.1.5.<br />
Gear Upgrades and Item Level<br />
The valor point system to upgrade gear makes the transition between raid tiers awkward as it makes you have less chances for upgrades in the next raid.<br />
The valor point gear upgrade system is something that could make sense during the last raid tier of an expansion.<br />
The 30 item level increase is the smallest number to make upgrades feel relevant in a new raid tier.<br />
PvP Vendors<br />
The team has given each slot several options to choose from over the course of earning conquest cap each week. It is different from a vendor, but gives the player more control and options to fill in gaps as time goes on.<br />
There isn't a raid vendor where you can just buy a piece you want, and so the team wants reward systems to feel balanced across the board.<br />
If there are extremely outlying stats for PvP for a class the team wants to address that instead of making the player feel like they need a piece of gear with that stat.<br />
Mythic +<br />
There is nothing to announce at the moment, but the team wants to give more unique rewards for Mythic + seasons.<br />
The invisibility potion cooldown reduction was meant to lessen the necessity of a rogue's shroud.<br />
The team wants to better showcase other classes' unique utility in Mythic +.<br />
The team wants to take a look at timers, mobs, and dungeons that seem to encourage needing invisibility.<br />
Creating a punishment for keystone abandoners would probably create more problems and there are certain runs that arguably should be abandoned (such as when a group is in over their heads and would take hours to clear the dungeon)<br />
The team has talked about social ratings and endorsements in Mythic +.<br />
Transmog<br />
Tier sets and class themed armor could return in the future.<br />
Class specific sets were removed for now to allow more variety and distinct sets from different locations over more iterations of class themes.<br />
Heart of Azeroth in 8.2 and Beyond<br />
The team wants to move away from unlocking the same traits over the course of the expansion.<br />
The traits on Azerite Armor will all be unlocked when you obtain a piece of gear.<br />
The artifact power will instead give you abilities on your Heart of Azeroth, many of which are active abilities.<br />
These abilities could be earned and distinct based on the content that you earn it from such as raids or Mythic +.<br />
Titan Residuum<br />
Residuum funneling is only done by the most extreme guilds.<br />
The team would rather reduce the gaps between the advantage these extreme methods provide over other players.<br />
Development and Design<br />
The biggest challenge of WoW is designing for the many different audiences that play the game.<br />
The game is richer for having a variety of audiences over the team focusing on designing for one archetype.<br />
Catch up mechanics are there to lessen the barrier of having to return to old content for months to help someone that is returning to the game catch up.<br />
Global Cooldown<br />
The team is not done bringing abilities back off of the global cooldown.<br />
The team is discussing how to make dps/healing increasing abilities more interesting to press. An example would be having a burst of healing ring out when pressing Ascendance before you transform.<br />
Class Changes and Roles<br />
Healer DPS should not be close to damage dealers as their rotations are simple and have a low ceiling.<br />
Some healers could use some help with their damage, but they want to avoid a Discipline Priest at the beginning on the expansion situation.<br />
There are no major class overhauls planned in 8.1.5.<br />
Pure balance will likely happen over the coming weeks through hotfixes after looking at the new raid feedback, specifically for Arms warriors.<br />
Complete overhauls of a spec (such as rotation and resource alterations) will most likely not happen in a patch and have to wait for a new expansion.<br />

TL;DR (with 10 characters)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gasparde</div><div class="date">2019-02-21, 02:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">just because they dont answer &quot;HEY BLIZZARD FUCK YOU, WHEN IS ION GUNNA BE FIRED&quot; does not make them bad... every Q&amp;A has had many good questions. maybe not all of them but atleast 3-4<br />
<br />
Solid strawman. If the best they can do is 3-4 good questions per 1 hour Q&amp;A every 2-3 months and you're actually happy with that level of communication (just because we had 2-3 good questions every 4 months before that), then that's just sad. Yes, quite literally they're communicating more, but if them working on communication for years boils down to 3 more relevant answers per year... then that is just pathetic for a multi bajillion dollar company.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lets look at the last Q&amp;A for example since you love to say they answer literally nothing.<br />
<br />
Kul Tiran Humans and Zandalari Trolls<br />
They will release with Patch 8.1.5<br />
You only have to get the war campaign achievement to unlock them, which you obtain before the quest to go into the raid.<br />
They are not available yet because story wise they wanted the events to play out that solidifies them joining the larger fight.<br />
They originally planned to have the Zandalari available with the Dark Iron Dwarves at launch, but replaced them with Mag'har Orcs so that it would make more sense with the flow of the story and to pair them with Kul Tirans.<br />
Kul Tiran humans are an entirely new rig and therefore were more time consuming to create.<br />
<br />
Them saying they'll be released with 8.1.5 after delaying them for 6 months and then not even giving us an ETA on that is not an answer, it's an excuse. Even more so, it's the 17th excuse in regards to that topic. The Zandalari requiring a proper story before joining the Horde is a load of crap seeing how it took the Maghar and Dark Irons pretty much a 10 minute questline to pledge eternal loyalty to this war. The only 'answer' here is that Kultirans are completely new... and that is something we knew already. We asked 'when' and they 'answered' with 'with this patch that's due in the near future', awesome.<br />
<br />
<br />
They don't anticipate the item level 400 reward quest happening every week because there are a lot more Alliance participating in War Mode.<br />
The extra rewards were meant to encourage more Alliance to participate but also to make Horde who did not like PvP to turn it off.<br />

<br />
Not an answer, that's an admission of them not listening, again. The Alliance got that stupid quest with 8.1, 2 months before the raid released... and people were saying how stupid it was for them to get a free heroic piece of loot every week. Back then they gave 0 fucking shits about giving us an answer. Turns out, 2 fucking months later, with the release of a new raid, giving out a free piece of heroic loot to 1 faction is still fucking stupid. Again, an excuse for not listening to community feedback 2 months ago.<br />
<br />
<br />
The War Mode bonus is determined by the amount of players participating on the outnumbered faction. They believe it might drop to 25% next week.<br />
The discrepancy between factions in War Mode has been cut in half since the change.<br />
<br />
This is the first real bit of new information so far. Yet it's shaded by doubt because for all we know they might just manually adjust the war mode bonus every single week. At this point all trust is gone so we just have to take this at face value because instead of showing actual numbers... they're just referring to them.<br />
<br />
<br />
The team is working on the issues causing the lag in certain War Mode shards.<br />
<br />
Duh, what else would they say? Don't you guys have $5k rigs and fiber, wtf?!<br />
<br />
<br />
Character Slots and Alts<br />
They might allow the cap of 50 characters total to all be on the same server.<br />
<br />
Ok, neat, indeed some new information.<br />
<br />
<br />
There might be a way for you to transfer War Resources from your main to your alts in 8.1.5.<br />
<br />
Confirming what many already believed to be a thing since it became a thing during Legion as well... although one might ask why we didn't get that from the beginning...<br />
<br />
<br />
The valor point system to upgrade gear makes the transition between raid tiers awkward as it makes you have less chances for upgrades in the next raid.<br />
The valor point gear upgrade system is something that could make sense during the last raid tier of an expansion.<br />
The 30 item level increase is the smallest number to make upgrades feel relevant in a new raid tier.<br />
<br />
Really nothing new. We know they hate valor points and everything surrounding it and we know they love the magical 30 ilvls. The only thing we didn't know is that they love titanforging making shit irrelevant but upgrades making shit irrelevant is no bueno. Them saying something could potentially make sense in a possible unclear future scenario... is not relevant information.<br />
<br />
<br />
The team has given each slot several options to choose from over the course of earning conquest cap each week. It is different from a vendor, but gives the player more control and options to fill in gaps as time goes on.<br />
There isn't a raid vendor where you can just buy a piece you want, and so the team wants reward systems to feel balanced across the board.<br />
If there are extremely outlying stats for PvP for a class the team wants to address that instead of making the player feel like they need a piece of gear with that stat.<br />
<br />
There's no PvP vendor because there's no PvE vendor either and thus it makes complete sense. So the last 10 years of PvP itemization didn't make sense, gotcha. <br />
<br />
<br />
Mythic +<br />
There is nothing to announce at the moment, but the team wants to give more unique rewards for Mythic + seasons.<br />
<br />
Whatever that means. 'eventually we do some stuff and it will be good'.<br />
<br />
<br />
The invisibility potion cooldown reduction was meant to lessen the necessity of a rogue's shroud.<br />
<br />
And it failed horribly at that. But I can't imagine that the question was 'why was the invis potion CD reduced' but more something along the lines of 'why the fuck is it ok that out of the top 200 m+ runs there's like 3 without a rogue, maybe shroud a teenie weenie bit op?'<br />
<br />
<br />
The team wants to better showcase other classes' unique utility in Mythic +.<br />
<br />
'We're looking into the matter that you've been reporting to us for the last 2.5 years but haven'T done anything about other than... actually reducing utility across the board', solid answer.<br />
<br />
<br />
The team wants to take a look at timers, mobs, and dungeons that seem to encourage needing invisibility.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to getting that then... eventually... perhaps... at some point.<br />
<br />
<br />
Creating a punishment for keystone abandoners would probably create more problems and there are certain runs that arguably should be abandoned (such as when a group is in over their heads and would take hours to clear the dungeon)<br />
<br />
This is a good answer. They have looked at a certain issue, discussed it and they came to a conclusion and told us about it. People might not like the answer but it's reasonable where Blizz is coming from and one can understand their thought process and argumentation.<br />
<br />
<br />
The team has talked about social ratings and endorsements in Mythic +.<br />
<br />
Because that is sooooo useful in Overwatch. I'm sure we'll get it eventually... or maybe not. But at least they said something.<br />
<br />
<br />
Transmog<br />
Tier sets and class themed armor could return in the future.<br />
<br />
Pretty sure we already had that confirmed like 4 times before that Q&amp;A.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Class specific sets were removed for now to allow more variety and distinct sets from different locations over more iterations of class themes.<br />
<br />
'Allow for more variety'. Because allowing for 4 armor-type sets per raid is more variety than allowing for 12 (13?!) class-type sets per raid. BUT DON'T FORGET THE AWESOME WARMODE SETS! Also, we've been told that numerous times since they've announced that we're not going to have tier sets this expansion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Heart of Azeroth in 8.2 and Beyond<br />
The team wants to move away from unlocking the same traits over the course of the expansion.<br />
The traits on Azerite Armor will all be unlocked when you obtain a piece of gear.<br />
The artifact power will instead give you abilities on your Heart of Azeroth, many of which are active abilities.<br />
These abilities could be earned and distinct based on the content that you earn it from such as raids or Mythic +.<br />
<br />
This is new information, this is good. Sadly it's coming 6 fucking months too late because they've decided to ignore 10 months of community feedback before deciding to change something about this obviously flawed system... eventually... maybe in 4-6-10 months or so.<br />
<br />
<br />
Titan Residuum<br />
Residuum funneling is only done by the most extreme guilds.<br />
<br />
Ok.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The team would rather reduce the gaps between the advantage these extreme methods provide over other players.<br />
<br />
But why if it's only done by like 20 guilds? If it's only done by 20 guilds the advantage can't be that big.<br />
<br />
<br />
Development and Design<br />
The biggest challenge of WoW is designing for the many different audiences that play the game.<br />
The game is richer for having a variety of audiences over the team focusing on designing for one archetype.<br />
Catch up mechanics are there to lessen the barrier of having to return to old content for months to help someone that is returning to the game catch up.<br />
<br />
Ok, very new information, spend more time elaborating please, haven't heard anything about your philosophy in that regard before.<br />
<br />
<br />
Global Cooldown<br />
The team is not done bringing abilities back off of the global cooldown.<br />
<br />
Good to hear, but also very pathetic. It speaks volumes about your competence if you have to revert 75% of the changes you made to something after 8 months of feedback.<br />
<br />
<br />
The team is discussing how to make dps/healing increasing abilities more interesting to press. An example would be having a burst of healing ring out when pressing Ascendance before you transform.<br />
<br />
9.0 will sure be great.<br />
<br />
<br />
Class Changes and Roles<br />
Healer DPS should not be close to damage dealers as their rotations are simple and have a low ceiling.<br />
Some healers could use some help with their damage, but they want to avoid a Discipline Priest at the beginning on the expansion situation.<br />
<br />
Duh.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are no major class overhauls planned in 8.1.5.<br />
<br />
Another real and new answer, sadly again a pretty sad one.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pure balance will likely happen over the coming weeks through hotfixes after looking at the new raid feedback, specifically for Arms warriors.<br />
<br />
Nothing new.<br />
<br />
<br />
Complete overhauls of a spec (such as rotation and resource alterations) will most likely not happen in a patch and have to wait for a new expansion.<br />
<br />
Another real and new answer, sadly again a pretty sad one.<br />
<br />
In there there's like 4, maybe 5 answers I'd consider valuable new information. The rest is repeating shit we already know and them acknowledging community feedback 12 months too late. This Q&amp;A could've lasted 10 minutes and we'd have had all the new information, having said that, it lasted an hour and was filled with useless crap and platitudes.</div></div><hr />

Ah, well.<br />
<br />
In FF you don't even need to do that. When an expansion launches with a new race, you'll get one free Fantasia(race change potion, for those who don't play) with the expansion. So unless you are indecisive on what race to play and keep buying them, you can go pretty far with the free ones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It’s not just that video though, that’s the point. Even videos that wowhead have posted have gotten instant dislikes (to the point where they’ve turned like/dislikes off on videos), with people even saying they’re dialling them purely because it’s Blizzard related. That’s toxic.<br />

To be fair there is no mention of a free fantasia with the Shadowbringers collectors edition despite Viera being added.<br />
<br />
But I mean it's £5 to race change anyway. Compared to the £19. Although they could possibly give a fantasia as a reward for the level 70 MSQ. Because the level 50 MSQ gives you a free one to replace the veteran rewards system going away. Who knows?<br />
<br />
Doesn't affect me either way because I have no intent on playing Viera. I mean the models and animations from what we saw on the females is pretty damn good but I just love my Au Ra too much. :)</div></div><hr />

I don't see a difference between 2 and 12 pointless Q&amp;As per year. Quantity doesn't make up for a lack of quality, especially when that quantity somehow only ever comes into play as some sort of damage control.<br />
These recent Q&amp;As have been nothing but 'you think you do, but you don't, 'having said that... you're actually wrong', 'pet battles are an important part of the world of warcraft', 'for the 17th time, transmog is a very important topic for us', 'can't give you any specific details on pretty much anything about we are about to do', 'the azerite system is actually a great system but we simply have to live with it's unforeseeable flaws forever because who could've fucking thunk things would turn out like this' aaaaaaaaaaaaand the latest 'after ignoring 6 months of your feedback... you're actually right, we had a developer actually log into the game for the first time in 6 years and play with azerite and he did indeed confirm it to be shit, we're going to change it.... eventually... but that being said, can't tell you anything other than that it's gonna be awesome'.<br />
<br />
More Q and As doesn't always equal better either lol. Especially when Ion just spouts things that nobody wants to hear and Lore looks miserable as hell.<br />
<br />
Look at FF14 and their live letters. Informative and they don't look like they want to just quit their jobs. They tell us what we want to hear. Least imo.</div></div><hr />

Firing the lawver is a good start, you have to address this to Activation, Blizzard isn't able to make their own major decisions, everything is dictated from Activision. On Oct.2nd 2018 Activision stock was 83,39$ today 22 Feb. it is 41,90$ and they still wondering why it goes down. <br />

<br />
It is yet another reason why I love FF14. They genuinely seem to care about what the players are after.<br />
I mean, I saw the big patch launch for WoW 8.1, ad genuinely came away underwhelmed. A handful of quests, time gated raid, and some little additions. IN terms of quests? You get more from a Hildebrande adventure in FF14 than you did from this, and those are entirely optional silliness.<br />
In terms of sheer scale and quality at the moment? I feel FF14 is beating WoW hands down, ultimately, the compeition is good for WoW, they were only at the top of their game when they had other companies snapping at their heels. So the better FF14 gets, and more subs they get, the better WoW will have to become or just fall behind.<br />
<br />
Here's hoping!</div></div><hr />

<br />
prelates are clergy and wear cloth, they aren't paladins i think. Maybe a blessed prelate? but that shouldn't count on the basis for being able to make a troll paladin. I really wish blizz would give insights on how certain races are able to be certain classes. *Wtb moar lore from blizz*<br />

Which means they will look completely stupid being forced to do the exact same Paladin-Quests as everybody else when leveling up...the same way Darkspear Druids completely lost their own &quot;flavour&quot; of Druid because they are just forced into the Circle of Cenarior...same as the two new Druids will be.<br />
