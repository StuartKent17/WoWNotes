The Argent Tournament mounts are being updated with this patch. Mounts already purchased at the Argent Tournament will be replaced with the updated mounts when this patch goes live. <br />

For those looking to get their hands on even more sweet rides, ten mounts using the original tournament look will be available for purchase from Argent Tournament vendors for 5 Champion's Seals and 500 gold (faction discounts apply). To purchase these original mounts at the Argent Tournament, players must be either members of, or exalted with, the corresponding faction.<br />

<br />
Argent Hippogryph Cost Lowered<br />
In order to better balance the cost of new rewards that we would like to add to the Argent Tournament, we will be changing the cost of the Argent Hippogryph flying mount in the next minor patch. These mounts will be reduced in cost from 250 Champion’s Seals to 150 Champion’s Seals. Further details regarding additional new rewards will be provided in the future.<br />
<br />
A display issue may occur with this change, causing the Argent Hippogryph to continue to display a cost of 250 Champion’s Seals. This display issue will be resolved in a future patch. <br />
<br />
Wintergrasp Quests now Weekly<br />
Wintergrasp daily quests are now weekly, most of the rewards have been increased to reflect these changes.<br />
In an effort to better balance the amount of players that are in Wintergrasp at any given time, we are changing the daily quests in Wintergrasp to a weekly format. This has led to an increase in the honor reward given by these quests as well as additional Stone Keeper's Shards. These quests will reset every Tuesday morning at 3:00 AM.<br />
<br />
There are two known issues that may occur once these changes are pushed to live realms:<br />
<br />
The quest mark will now show as gold, even though the quests are repeatable.<br />
After the quests reset, players near the NPC quest givers may need to move out of line of sight in order for the quests to properly appear.<br />
<br />

<br />
According to the latest PTR build, the honor gains in Wintergrasp have been slightly nerfed. <br />
Lake Wintergrasp<br />
Wintergrasp Victory (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=56902) now rewards 3000 Honor. (Down from 5000 Honor)<br />
Wintergrasp Defeat (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=58494) now rewards 1250 Honor. (Down from 3000 Honor)<br />
Tower Damaged (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=59135) now grants up to 750 Honor. (Down from 1250 Honor)<br />
Tower Destroyed (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=59136) now grants up to 750 Honor. (Down from 1250 Honor)<br />
Damaged Building Reward (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=59201) now grants up to 750 Honor. (Down from 1250 Honor)<br />
Intact Building Defender (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=59203) now grants up to 1500 Honor. (Down from 2500 Honor) (Note: Currently shown as 150 Honor but most likely a typo)<br />
<br />
<br />
Ulduar Item Changes<br />
Weapons from the hard mode version of Ulduar 10-Man have been upgraded and are now slightly more powerful. These changes should already be in game and patch 3.1.2 will only reflect them in the item tooltips, see the comparison below.<br />
In order to better reward players for completing hard mode encounters in 10-player Ulduar, we will be updating weapon rewards from these hard mode encounters to an item level of 232 in the next minor patch. Players already with these items should see an increase in the power of these items to better reflect the new item level. <br />
A few more items were also changed for various reasons. (Stats additions or redistribution, weapon speed changed, and texture fixed for <br />
&lt;font color=&quot;#A335EE&quot;&gt;Conqueror's Darkruned Legguards&lt;/font&gt; (/i/news/2009/may/ptr_9901_40.jpg))<br />
<br />
Please also note that due to the low amount of players on test realms, I couldn't get the stats of all the items here but most of them should be listed below. <br />

<br />
General<br />
New art textures have been added for Argent Tournament mounts. Any mounts already purchased from the Argent Tournament vendors will be updated automatically. Argent Tournament mounts with the old textures will still be available for purchase from the Argent Tournament vendors for a small Champion's Seal and gold cost (standard faction requirements apply).<br />
Copied Test Realm characters will no longer be copied with their achievement history in order to better facilitate the character copy process.<br />
<br />
Equipment Manager<br />
When enabled from the Interface Options menu, this feature will allow players to store sets of equipment, easily swap between saved sets using hotkeys, and pull items directly from backpacks or bank slots (must be at the bank to equip inventory from the bank).<br />
<br />
PVP<br />
Vehicle health and damage output in Strand of the Ancients and Lake Wintergrasp now scale with the item level of the operator's gear. Power scaling is now 1% damage and 1% health per average item level.<br />
All Lake Wintergrasp daily quests have been changed to a weekly format. The honor and Stone Keeper's Shards rewarded for completing these quests have been increased to compensate.<br />

Ventrilo Servers - MLG Voice<br />
A few weeks ago, Major League Gaming (the parent company of MMO-Champion) launched a new ventrilo hosting service called MLG Voice (http://www.mlgvoice.com/).<br />
<br />
First I would like to thanks all the people who signed up and who now use our services, your support to this site is much appreciated and will hopefully help improving it in the long run. <br />
<br />
I would also like to point out that the servers listed on the right of MLG Voice (http://www.mlgvoice.com/) are test servers that anyone can use to check the quality of the service before ordering. All you need is Ventrilo installed on your computer and clicking the connect link should work just fine (if you have a decent browser, but I'm sure you do)<br />

What's your source on this? Personally, I believe 5/26/2009, if you're right through, i'll believe any other patch date guess from you in the future :p<br />

I know this is sad, but I signed up for that mount dew alliance / horde thing (Check mmo-champion.com), anyways, after registering, I knew that the little pets that are related to this offer, the battle-bots we're going to be added in the 3.1.2 patch, anyways, when mousing over the &quot;Redeem Tokens&quot; text, it said Coming Soon 05/26/2009, think that would be an good guestimate of when the patch will come?

<br />
It's a buff. Currently it's 5% (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=64824).<br />
<br />
However it's bugged at the moment. If the set bonus procs while you're already casting a Starfire the buff will be consumed when the cast finishes. Until that bug is fixed the set bonus is nearly useless.</div></div><hr />

The Argent Tournament mounts are being updated with this patch. Mounts already purchased at the Argent Tournament will be replaced with the updated mounts when this patch goes live.<br />
<br />
For those looking to get their hands on even more sweet rides, ten mounts using the original tournament look will be available for purchase from Argent Tournament vendors for 5 Champion's Seals and 500 gold (faction discounts apply). To purchase these original mounts at the Argent Tournament, players must be either members of, or exalted with, the corresponding faction.<br />
<br />
Do you need to be champion with a faction to buy the old mount?? (seals 500 gold) Or just exalted??</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought they would use the city symbol (the same symbol as in the tabards and standarts) for the mounts armor...<br />
<br />
Really I have no idea why one mount costs 100 seals and the other only 5 seals... both of them are boring -.-<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, I don't see a lot of difference in them either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Am I the only one confused by this? This seems to indicate the rewards for just participating (quests aside) have gone way up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I would think so, you can only buy the mount from that faction vendor, and the vendor only opens up after you have reached champion with them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bows, crossbows and guns of item level 226 or higher (which means weapons from Kel'Thuzad, Ulduar and the Furious Gladiator pieces) will do around 30 more dps. This should translate to a hunter damage increase of a few percent.<br />

Personally, I believe 5/26/2009, if you're right through, i'll believe any other patch date guess from you in the future :p<br />
<br />
But for why I think 5/26/2009...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What are you smoking? The US have patched, and the EU have been warned they will patch tonight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes i think you are. the bigger number in parentheses is before the patch and the small number stating &quot;now&quot; is after the patch.<br />
<br />
(that means it went down)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those rewards are split automatically with up to 10 people. (I.E. if you won a Wintergrasp while being the only person in the zone, that's what you'd get. Obviously, you always get 1/10th of that since there's always at least 1 raid in the zone.)</div></div><hr />

Note to Blizz: 7x3 does NOT equal 10.<br />

Hope to hell you're adjusting the purchase cost of the BoA items. I just got convinced to come back to the game for 30 days. If this stays like this, I'm outta here again.</div></div><hr />
