We’re deploying our first build for the upcoming content update—Rise of Azshara—to our Public Test Realms. It is now testable. Here’s an outline of what’s coming in this PTR.<br />
<br />
Now Available for Testing<br />
<br />
Heart of Azeroth system update: introducing Essences<br />
New Zone: Mechagon<br />
New Arena: The Robodrome<br />
Mount Equipment<br />
Crestfall and Snowblossom Island Expeditions<br />
Ashran Epic Battleground<br />
<br />
<br />
Our initial testing will be primarily technical, so some Rise of Azshara features will be locked/unavailable for the first few days while we work on initial concerns with the above content. Please note that Ashran may not easily complete a queue in the PTR.<br />
<br />
<br />
Coming Soon<br />
<br />
Heroic Battle for Stromgarde<br />
New Missions<br />
New Zone: Nazjatar<br />
<br />
Explore the new zone including quest lines, World Quests, and World PvP Events focused on strengthening alliances with the new aquatic races<br />
<br />
Heritage Armors<br />
New Profession Recipes<br />
New Raid-- Azshara’s Eternal Palace<br />
<br />
As always, we’ll coordinate the testing of this new raid’s encounters via scheduled announcements.<br />
<br />
New Dungeon-- Operation: Mechagon<br />
Pet Battle Dungeon: Stratholme<br />
Direhorn Training quests<br />
Updates to Brewfest<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We plan to do a wipe of all characters in a few weeks after getting focused feedback on the Heart of Azeroth Essences. This will allow us to test the feel and pacing of obtaining them all naturally. We’ll give you a heads up on that character wipe here in this forum.<br />
<br />
