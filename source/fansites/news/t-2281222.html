Some New Blue Faces<br />
Over the coming weeks, you’ll be seeing some new Blue accounts posting here in the forums. These fine folks are joining on to help us be more present and active in discussions with you all.<br />
<br />
Our new additions will be labeled “Forum Engagement.” While these people are Blizzard employees, they aren’t game designers and won’t be able to answer those deeper questions about topics like game balance. And no worries; you’ll still see the same names you recognize.<br />

PvP Like a Pro - Practicing Effectively<br />
<br />
Two weeks ago, we kicked off the PvP like a Pro series, where we talk to some of the best Arena players in the world and gain their insights. <br />
<br />
Part 3 - Practicing Effectively<br />
<br />
Minpojke of team Northern Gaming Blue has achieved rank one in Arena every season since 2011. His current squad has been playing together for more than two years, and came third in the Global Finals at BlizzCon 2016. With his help, we’ve built a five-step guide to help you practice like a pro!<br />
<br />
Synergy - Align Your Team<br />
Before setting out on your quest to the top, make sure you’re “aligned as a team,” says Minpojke. Like in any group activity, “it’s very important that everyone has the same goals and the same drive to do what it takes to win.” Make sure your team shares similar ambitions, and is aligned on how much effort will be required to achieve them. And of course, make sure you have similar gaming schedules so you can play and practice together!<br />
<br />
Atmosphere - Stay Positive<br />
It’s important to have a good atmosphere while playing. Minpojke says, “If you and your group get along and even become friends, you’ll like playing and actually learn more as well.” Be sure that the mood stays positive so that you can enjoy competing and improving together. It’s much easier to keep a team motivated if you’re all having fun—it’s a game after all!<br />
<br />
Stated more simply, Minpojke says, “It’s easy to win as a team—in the sense that it’s easy to be happy and celebrate—but if you’re capable of losing together, then you’ll be a great team.”<br />
<br />
Strategy - Know the Meta<br />
When it comes to making practice effective, Minpojke feels it’s a priority to stay up to date with the current meta. He told us that the best way to do this is to follow tournaments, high-level Arena streams, and the PvP Leaderboards to see which classes are on top.<br />
<br />
“It’s quite easy to keep up with the meta. Watch streams to see what the pros are playing, and track the ladder to see which classes and compositions are at the top. And don’t forget to follow tournaments to see the best comps shine.” Once you’re confident in what you want to play, it’s time to queue up! As FabsS discussed in our previous interview, Minpojke says that it’s important to set your win condition before the gates open. “Ask what you want to achieve as a team; will you focus on a lot of CC or try to draw out the game longer?” Since you know what matchup you’ll be playing against, you can start to ask these questions and develop your strategy.<br />
<br />
Analysis - Review Your Games<br />
If your setup supports it, Minpojke recommends recording as many sessions as you can—they’re much more valuable then looking at a damage meter. He says that the first objective is to see if you followed your game plan. Did you stick to it? Did it work? If the answer to either of these questions is no, you need to work on executing the plan better in future or possibly changing it up all together.<br />
<br />
Watching your own recordings is also a chance to highlight individual mistakes. As Minpojke says, “Always stay self-critical, and always look for ways to improve—you’ll notice pretty quickly your most crucial and common mistakes.” While Minpojke emphasizes that “losing is arguably the best way of learning,” he also reminded us that “it’s very important to recognize when you do well.” Think positively here: no one can play the perfect game, but there are often good takeaways to be emulated going forward.<br />
<br />
Reviewing recordings of his gameplay is a regular part of Minpojke’s routine, as well as discussing previous matches with his team between games while queueing. You can learn from a win as well as a loss!<br />
<br />
Execute - Implement Your Analysis<br />
After watching the replays, it’s time to set your goals. Decide what you want to focus on, and “make plans before you queue for a session.” If there was a specific matchup you were struggling with, you can discuss plans for how you’ll react to it next time.<br />
<br />
In some instances, it could be worth writing some notes, especially if you have many things to focus on versus many compositions. Minpojke equated it to studying for a test, “Practice it, and read it over and over until it sticks in your head.”<br />
<br />
Minpojke attended his first BlizzCon with current teammate Zunniyaki in 2013, finishing in second place. Northern Gaming Blue are the defending European Champions, and with nine BlizzCon appearances between their players, they’re one of the most experienced rosters in the field.<br />
<br />
You can watch Minpojke and Northern Gaming Blue compete live at gamescom from August 23-26. For the full details on when and where you can watch, head on over to our European Championship Finals blog (https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/news/20936951).<br />

<br />
For the most part, I agree with your sentiment. I am fond of the troll background that was introduced with Cataclysm. I have to admit, though, that the 7.3 backgrounds overall are better as a backdrop for viewing items in the foreground. I think Blizz should start with just the larger window size, then look at feedback for that. Changing just the size of the Dressing Room may be enough.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">A Dark Knight</div><div class="date">2017-08-19, 01:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For some strange reason, Warlocks are getting background from WoD's Shadowmoon Burial Grounds - Nerh'zul's room. First of all, SBG is a necro-void themed, so it has just the void part related to warlocks. Secondly, Nerh'zul was never a warlock. He was a shaman and a necromancer, so unless Blizzard intends to turn us to necromancers, this background has no sense. Actually, this background doesn't suit any class at all.<br />

thanks, i was thinking all day where have i seen that room.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Outlaw Rogue: Now consists of 5% 0% of the whole rogue population.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nize</div><div class="date">2017-08-19, 08:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">These aren't nerfs from live, with a few exceptions, such as Vanish change.<br />
<br />
Aura changes are tuning knobs to already buffed classes. Outlaw, for instance, has 30% aura multiplier on live. This 30% buff was then distributed among all the abilities and the aura reduced to 4% to test at that level. Then they opted to remove the aura. Blunderbuss wasn't part of the aura, however, and it received a 30% damage increase, so all in all, Outlaw rogues are getting a tiny buff.</div></div><hr />

Only casual players will care about that. Raiders worth their salt will play whatever spec is currently best. Artifacts make that harder than it should be.<br />
But, I know they have to cater for the casual player since that's where the bread is buttered, so nothing we can do.</div></div><hr />

they their balance team doesnt make sense for years now<br />
<br />
what my suspicion is their tuning team just consist of family of devs who couldnt find a work even in mcdonalds so they put them to &quot;tune&quot; shit and all they do is play poorly all day long. nepotism at its prime. <br />
<br />
because there is 0 fucing chances those are employes whos perfomance is reviewed quartaly or yearly.</div></div><hr />

If they nerf unholy DK they will be useless, right now frost DK is the very last in dps rankings and blood dk is just &quot;fine&quot;. Same with WW, they are on the lower half of the rank and they even nerf it. At least shamans do decent damage and are good healers..<br />
<br />
PS: Just to put things in perspective, a retribution pala has more mobility, ccs, damage, defensive cds, heals... there is no reason at the moment to use a DK over a paladin other than class fantasy.</div></div><hr />

Crying because your class doesn't push 2 milion dps with 1 spell and can be played even by rocks, doesn't make that Dev are incompetent</div></div><hr />

The current patch notes found on the battlenet launcher state &quot;increase damage of all abilities by 10%&quot; under the enhancement shaman section. So is it safe to say that the tunes in the PTR patch notes above are not a nerf? Blizzard was just trying things and realized enhance didnt need that extra 3%?</div></div><hr />
