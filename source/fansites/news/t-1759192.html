BlizzCon 2015 Ticket Purchasing Guide<br />
The first batch of BlizzCon 2015 tickets goes on sale Wednesday, April 15 at 7 p.m. PT. When the time comes, hit the link below for your chance to snag some.<br />
<br />
Get BlizzCon 2015 Tickets Here (http://blizz.ly/1MueS10)<br />
<br />
Tickets usually go fast, so if you want to attend this year’s show, it pays to be prepared. Ticket sales are once again being handled through Eventbrite (http://blizz.ly/1MueS10) this year, and a few things are different from 2014. It’s worth reading our BlizzCon Ticket Info (http://blizz.ly/1492iCj) page to get an overview, but if you want more details on how it works, check out this handy guide.<br />
<br />
What Information You’ll Need to Provide<br />
You’ll want to have the following information handy when you’re buying BlizzCon tickets:<br />
<br />
<br />
Your information: First Name, Last Name, Email Address, Character name (optional)<br />
Credit card information, including billing information (Country, Address, City, State, Zip Code)<br />
Your friends’/family’s information: First Name, Last Name, Email Address, Character Name (optional)—note that you’ll be able to go back and change these until August 14.<br />
<br />
<br />
What’s New for 2015<br />
A few changes are in store for ticket buyers this year, including updates to how tickets are delivered based on BlizzCon 2014 feedback, as well as some changes to the Eventbrite purchasing process.<br />
<br />
Barcodes Delivered Immediately—This year, ticket buyers and attendees will receive the bar-code emails used to claim their badges immediately after purchasing tickets. In addition, bar codes will be accessible via the ticket purchaser’s Eventbrite account, where they’ll be available to view or reprint at any time. Buyers should note that bar code emails will also be sent to whoever you assign your tickets to, so if you’re not yet certain who’s coming, you might want to assign tickets to your own email address for now. (You’ll have until August 14 to make attendee changes.)<br />
<br />
Eventbrite Updates—Eventbrite has made some updates to their waiting room that should help make the experience smoother for BlizzCon hopefuls. This year, people in the waiting room will no longer be sent back to the event page if their turn comes up but the number of tickets they requested is not available. Instead, they’ll remain in the waiting room and retain their position in line until another order for the quantity of tickets they requested is released back for sale. For example, if you requested 4 tickets and reach the front of the line, the next time an order for 4 tickets is released, you’ll have first dibs. (Keep in mind this also means you won’t be able to select a different, lower ticket quantity if you reach the front of the line and the ticket quantity you requested isn’t available.)<br />
<br />
Step-by-Step Guide<br />
Step 1: Head to the Eventbrite ticketing page (http://blizz.ly/1MueS10), and choose the quantity of tickets you wish to purchase from the drop-down menu (4 ticket per household limit).<br />
<br />
*UPDATED FOR 2015*<br />
Step 2: Click Order Now. If all tickets have been claimed, buyers may find themselves in line in a “waiting room” while others complete their purchases—see the “What’s New for 2015” section above for more details. Keep in mind that being in the waiting room doesn’t necessarily mean you’re guaranteed tickets.<br />
<br />
Step 3: Once you’re in the checkout and registration process, you’ll have 8 minutes to complete your purchase. A countdown will be displayed on-screen so you know how much time you have remaining. After 8 minutes, the tickets will be released for others to buy, drawing from those in the waiting room.<br />
<br />
Step 4: Fill out the Ticket Buyer information (your name and email) to purchase the tickets. Make sure you enter a valid email address that you use regularly, as important event communications (including your badges) will be emailed to this address.<br />
<br />
Step 5: Enter your credit card information. Remember, you will need to have this card at the convention if you need to make changes on-site. See the Badge Information page (http://blizz.ly/17iSsuP) for more information.<br />
<br />
Step 6: Enter your name and email address for the first ticket (or your friend/family member’s information if you’re purchasing a ticket for someone other than yourself), and character name (optional). If you don’t have that information now, just enter your own name and email for now—you’ll have until August 14 to make changes.<br />
<br />
*NEW FOR 2015* When entering attendee names and emails here and in Step 9, keep in mind that tickets will be sent to both the purchaser’s email address as well as the email addresses assigned to each ticket immediately upon completing your purchase.<br />
<br />
Step 7: Check the box to agree to the waiver. If you do not agree, you cannot proceed with purchasing BlizzCon tickets. Remember there is a 4-ticket-per-household limit for General Admission BlizzCon tickets.<br />
<br />
Step 8: Enter your friends’ or family members’ name and email address for each additional ticket. Again, you’ll have until August 14 to make changes, so just enter your own for now if you need to sort out who’s attending later.<br />
<br />
If you do not have that information at the time of purchase, use the drop-down menu to auto-fill the ticket with your own name and email address—or, you can manually enter your own information. Remember you need to do this separately for each additional ticket you’ll be purchasing.<br />
<br />
Step 9: You will need to agree to the waiver for each additional ticket you’re purchasing.<br />
<br />
Step 10: Once you’ve entered everything, click Pay Now.<br />
<br />
Once you click Pay Now, you will be sent to a “processing order” page. Once your order is complete, you’ll receive a confirmation email from Eventbrite—be sure to check your Spam folder if you don’t see it.<br />
<br />
*NEW FOR 2015* Emails containing bar codes to claim badges will be sent immediately upon purchase. All tickets will be sent to both the purchaser’s email address as well as the email address assigned to a ticket.<br />
<br />
Congratulations! You have successfully purchased tickets to BlizzCon 2015!</div></div><hr />

I'm not really looking forward to some idiot in LFR blowing your own shared 2 minute cooldown by popping it during transitions etc, but I guess that's a niche case. In any event, a much better ring re-design. Put some emphasis back on role leads making decisions.<br />
<br />
Edit: I skimmed the rings initially, I didn't see the 'on expiration' effect of the DPS/Heal rings and the tank soul link effect. Holey moley that's stronk.</div></div><hr />

Dude. It is a legendary. It should feel legendary. The last legendaries were like a 7% sustained DPS increase as well. <br />
<br />
The shared tank CD is cool, you should have tank bro synergy. My only gripe is like, I can't see myself ever tanking with a co-tank that doesn't have the ring. Just straight up garbage to lose that CD if the other tank doesn't have the ring.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pretty sure these new ring effects will not last very long either. It's going to promote ring stacking. <br />
<br />
Not substantially different than &quot;ilvl 680 or gtfo&quot;. This is an RPG, gear matters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
nothing different from the cloak, don't have it? ok you're doing about 8% less dps than someone who does, the ring will probably be 8-10% of your dps as well.<br />
<br />
but it was worse, since it was cloak AND legendary meta which was probably more like 15% dps missing without both.</div></div><hr />

As a concrete example, a Fury warrior with Anger Management has an effective Recklessness cooldown that is a bit over 2 minutes so you'd want to hold it off, but many other classes have cooldowns that are just 2 minutes flat.</div></div><hr />

The preview video was awesome, but sad that I won't get to see it (no flying). What's that? You don't need flying to see 100% of the zone? To see how cool it looks? Then why is it that every one of these videos are never done from a ground only viewpoint? Because that wouldn't look as cool as zooming in from the sky.</div></div><hr />

Yes but BL doesn't have the cooldown syncing problem since most encounters only give you one. With a 2m cooldown your raid wants it used immediately on cooldown to get as many uses and overall benefit as possible, even if it leads to some specs having their cooldowns not line up. Also, BL is only available to mages and shamans, anyone can pop these rings.</div></div><hr />

Warlocks work with a 2 min CD.<br />
Regardless of classes, dps increasers like this will be either used on CD or timed around boss phases. Think of it as a mini-heroism multiple times per fight.<br />

Blizzard has no idea what going on with balance in their game. All these changes did not tally with the current balance in pve. Feral is already one of strongest on single target dps and most weak AoE. Guess what was in the previous patch notes. These jumps from 30% to 5% at monks nerf also. <br />

Yes but BL doesn't have the cooldown syncing problem since most encounters only give you one. With a 2m cooldown your raid wants it used immediately on cooldown to get as many uses and overall benefit as possible, even if it leads to some specs having their cooldowns not line up. Also, BL is only available to mages and shamans, anyone can pop these rings.<br />

Hunters also have Bloodlust</div></div><hr />

Putting the proc as either heal or dps removes the entire point of being able to have both rings and then picking the one that fits best for your class.<br />
<br />
Even though every Tank, Physical DPS or Caster without a healing spec was locked into a single ring right from the start, so think yourself lucky you got to choose up until now. The point of being able to buy extra rings isn't so you can choose, it's so you have rings for your other specs. Because you can't choose if you're not in a healing spec. Besides, the cooldown is so powerful I'm pretty sure the stats not being perfect for you isn't going to matter. I'm sure a lot of the casters would rather NOT have versitility on their ring, I'm not a massive fan of a lack of Mastery on my ring. Everyone has to suffer with the stats on ring being one size fits all, it's not special to you.<br />
<br />
Also, love the amount of people being salty about people using the rings in LFR. It doesn't really matter does it? I mean people pop BL on trash all the time, but does it have ANY, and I mean ANY effect on the odds of the boss collapsing as soon as you cough at him? Yeah it's fustrating, but if you want or are expecting any degree of coordination, especially with the current LFR, you're in the wrong place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The zone really is awesome, it's even better when you run around it and can experience the sense of BIG that it has - it's the best zone in the expansion. The Iron Horde actually feels like a threat, that there's menace here, that it's dangerous - and the shame is, that it's the first time. <br />
<br />
If this zone had opened in the beginning, the IH would have felt like an actual threat. The whole zone feels a lot like Shadowmoon in TBC. <br />

The one thing it doesnt show is how massive Hellfire is, and the areas right around it. The Iron Docks felt massive - this feels bigger.</div></div><hr />

Get a good guild and there is less chance of trolling with it. As for timing it with class CDs, it is much better to get 25% increase more often than to make that 25% be worth more when it's used.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You did notice they also removed the buff to Tiger Brew? So basicly you get a flat out 5% nerf on your WW accoording to PTR patchnotes atm.<br />
Not finalized of course (god I hope not).. but.. WW were bad (in pvp; I dont' care bout pve) and this with this... just 5% worse.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
How do you implement a 30% nerf to most (if not all) windwalker abilities, then 2 days later, go from 30% -&gt; 5%?<br />
<br />
it had no Rising Sun Kick nerf.. + buff to Tiger Brew from 6 to 10% netting by using 10 of 'm 'slightly' compairable on damage. UNLESS you were using healing ablities to stay alive... those were never mentioned .. so they basicly had a 40% healing increase. <br />
<br />
Now they also removed the Tiger Brew's boost... Basicly just giving WW a 5% nerf. Which is so awesome in pvp coz we really do tons of damage and have great survivabilty .. oh wait.. <br />
<br />
not.</div></div><hr />

I get the extra armor should have made up some of the difference but going from a base 30 to a base 10 was horrible. Still annoyed that BOK doesn't increase stagger amount now but I will manage. <br />
<br />
I hate the rings. It's a good idea in theory and has the potential to be awesome if timed perfectly but, at least as a tank, I use my CD's at different times than my other tank. Sometimes one of us is getting crushed while the other is hanging back barely taking damage just waiting for our respective taunt swaps etc. It has the potential to be a waste for one of us far too often. I could see it being useful for a fight like Butcher with how it is currently listed, but a vast majority of the fights aren't like that. Also, I do see the stacking thing as a possible pitfall. I prefer the legendary items to have a personal either on use or proc effect. I don't want to be penalized if someone uses it at the wrong time or doesn't have the ring at all.<br />
<br />
I wish they would make those gear tokens BoA or fix the follower gear up process. I too often get tokens that are a waste like the 615/630 ilvl tokens and some of my toons have so many extra tokens it's silly... at least I know I can vendor them now. Maybe they could implement a trade system where I can trade those 615/630/645 ilvl tokens for the straight up ilvl increase tokens at the very least since they aren't going to make them BoA.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The devs forgot that flying is possible ... to be frank i don't even leave my garrison nowadays - just porting between ashran and my garrison and to raids ... after hitting 100 there was no need to go outside and explore the world (no faction that i really need to get exalted with, no quests except the legendary stuff, no daily grind, no other things that can lure me out of my garrison) - only doing raids. It is the opposite what the devs intented - force me into enjoying the &quot;wonderful&quot; world they have created for me by forcing me to ride and not be able to fly - but they accomplished the opposite. It is too troublesome and time consuming to travel with ground mounts.</div></div><hr />

This ring shared CD is the worst thing i have heared of in years. Please re-do this. Take it back to RPPM or keep it an on-use. I dont need other people activating my CD's for me. I cant beleive this is still even being considered.</div></div><hr />
