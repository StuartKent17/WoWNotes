<br />
Well... at least this ones are not really an issue (the main faction reputations are so easy to get to exalted, that by the time that you get to max lvl, you will be exalted in your race main faction and maybe a couple more)<br />
<br />
Note: Though i still hate how they dealt with Allied Race that use Legion reps<br />

Sort of annoying how the blood elf male gets a dress version. Give me pants ffs.<br />
<br />
There's a pant version (It may leave things to be desired to some people)<br />
<br />
Note: Both version are for both genders, the male was shown with the dress version for the sake of showing off the &quot;Spellbreaker&quot; looks.<br />
<br />

<br />
I have a question, did they added the 3D plate part that the boots have to the non-dress version?</div></div><hr />

You do realize heritage armor is only usable by the one race it's designed for, so your complaint makes zero sense. &quot;useless alts just for heritage&quot; would be just as useless if you paid for it as well and didn't use it as leveling it up and not using it. <br />
<br />
Now if you're saying it should be given with purchase of boost or race change, then people would complain that blizz is &quot;forcing&quot; them to buy those services. You people and your delusions of being &quot;forced&quot; to do things are absolutely insane. Never once have I felt &quot;forced&quot; to do anything in game that I don't want to do.</div></div><hr />

Better yet with how the theme is going it makes more sense for Undead and Nightelf heritage armor. But these look great as well and I'm sure more will come in the future.</div></div><hr />

I was thinking about this the other day and trying not to believe it could be so<br />
Maybe if i did mythic+ I could fool myself it was fun and content but these BFA dungeons ARE THE WORST MOST BORING DUNGEONS ever<br />

Sure. BfA is totally worse than that expansion that Blizzard almost completely dropped support for after launch, releasing only one raid and one endgame zone as meaningful content in the span of nearly two years.<br />
<br />
You keep telling yourself that.<br />

<br />
You do realize that there are people that race change their existing characters and level an alt just for that raced changed character to get the allied race heritage armor? I am doing that as well. For example i race changed my warrior to Highmountain and will level a druid to 110 just to get that heritage. Ill probably race change it afterwards to Zandalari.<br />

Well it feels like WoD, there should have been more shit to begin with for one with how large the WoW team is now. At least with Garrisons there was always something to work towards personally whether it was mounts or transmog gear or a portal building. It is all rep in this expansion more so than any other in recent years and all the rewards those reps give are underwhelming as far as gear and what not, worl of rep craft.</div></div><hr />

1.) put on a silvermoon tabard<br />

<br />
I mean 8.1 actually has a lot of content in it.. this is just side content that they are slowly giving to all the races similar to the new allied races we are getting. It is also 'content' that many people actually want and will enjoy. Just because it isn't something that you personally want, does not mean that you have to bitch and moan that they are giving it to others. Enjoy the plenty of other content from the patch and let those who want it enjoy this. P.S. If none of the content from 8.1 is what you want atm, then just unsub and take a break from the game until they release something you will be happy with.<br />
<br />

They're pretty much meh sets and not as good as the void elf and nightborne sets.<br />
<br />
I agree that the BE set is meh, but the dwarf set is actually awesome. The only thing I'd prefer on it is slightly smaller horns - but that is easily rectified by using a different helm with the set.</div></div><hr />

Maybe I'm just sick of the Blood Elf colors scheme and bias because of the aforementioned, but this set literally just looks like an updated Sunwell set. If that's what they were going for then it's perfect I guess. <br />

I played through them both and everyone since 2005, I have a great understanding on the scope of the game design of this game over the 14 years of its existence.

I was considering using my 110 Boost on a Dwarf Shaman but I don't know if I've seen enough changes to Shaman to justify it.<br />

<br />
So does heritage armor for Dark Iron Dwarves. They get one set per race, that's it. If you don't like it and think it doesn't fit your class you don't have to use it or even unlock it. Also you can try to come up with your own sets based on those. For example I'm gonna use only bottom half for my dwarf hunter.</div></div><hr />

make sure you kill every single mob in the dungeon if you can. the rep gained is based on mobs killed.</div></div><hr />
