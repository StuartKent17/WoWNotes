&quot;An Inside Job&quot; - Legendary Quest Line Cinematic<br />
Players that were very lucky with drops have already completed Chapter III: The Foundry Falls (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/9642-chapter-iii-the-foundry-falls), which unlocks this cinematic and the item level 710 ring (http://www.wowdb.com/items/armor/rings?filter-ilvl-min=710).<br />

Patch 6.1 - Legendary Quests<br />
Patch 6.1 added several new legendary quests to lead up to the cinematic above. There are several spoilers in the quest text, so check the quest pages to see it. <br />
<br />
The Final Assault (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/37841-the-final-assault) is the final quest that asks us to wait for Patch 6.2: <br />
<br />
Prepare your garrison and await further instructions from Archmage Khadgar. [Coming in Patch 6.2!]<br />
<br />
Our campaign in Draenor has taken an unexpected turn. With Gul'dan assuming power over the Iron Horde, history is poised to repeat itself - our world is in more peril than ever.<br />
<br />
It's time to bring the full might of your garrison to bear against Tanaan Jungle. Marshal your forces, &lt;name&gt;, and for my part I will research ways to counter Gul'dan's magic.<br />
<br />
I will be in contact with you soon.<br />

Patch 6.1.2 PTR Patch Notes<br />
Patch 6.1.2 is now available for testing on the Public Test Realms (PTR)! Participating on the Public Test Realms lets you test patches before it has been released on live realms. If you'd like to help test and provide feedback, you can start by copying your character and downloading the PTR client. Once you've had a chance to try things out, visit our PTR Discussion 6.1.2 forum to discuss the patch. To report issues or errors, use the in-game Submit Bug feature (found under Game Menu -&gt; Help -&gt; Submit Bug) or by visiting the PTR Bug Report 6.1.2 forum.<br />
<br />
Introducing the WoW Token<br />
Coming soon to an Azeroth near you: the WoW Token, a new in-game item that allows players to simply and securely exchange gold and game time between each other.<br />
<br />
Players will be able to purchase a WoW Token through the in-game Shop for real money, and then sell it on the Auction House for gold at the current market price. When a player buys a WoW Token from the Auction House for gold, the Token becomes Soulbound, and the player can then redeem it for 30 days of game time.<br />
<br />
<br />
The WoW Token feature will be enabled at a future date. Patch 6.1.2 adds in the framework needed for the WoW Token feature in the game client and is not active at this time. In the meantime, check out this FAQ (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/18141101/introducing-the-wow-token-3-2-2015) for details on how the feature works.<br />

New World of Warcraft Comic: Blood and Thunder<br />
Fenris Wolfbrother’s bravery and strength is matched only by his desire to prove himself a capable warrior at any cost. While his father Garad, chieftain of the Frostwolves, warns Fenris of the perils of putting one’s own whims before the needs of the family, the neighboring Thunderlord clan hunts and slays the dangerous Gronn without restriction or remorse.<br />
<br />
Envious of the Thunderlord and dismissive of his father’s teachings, Fenris begins a double life. During the day, he will be a tame, obedient Frostwolf… at night, under a different name, he becomes something else entirely.<br />
<br />
But Fenris must still bear responsibility for both his actions and those of the “Iron Wolf.”<br />

Not going to happen, I think. After all Grom is a conqueror and I think he would support the ideas of his son.....and *we* killed his son for that, not Gul'dan. At this point the story could turn in all directions tho...<br />
<br />
I think Gul'dan will finally break Grom(or force him to drink the demon blood).</div></div><hr />

No, from the information before this Garrosh kept his mouth shut about the whole Hellscream bit of his name. <br />
<br />
However, if Gul'dan learned off the whole timey-whimey stuff that got us into this whole mess (a couple of interrogations on the right blackfuses would do the trick.) and figure it all out. For Grom, that was probably the first time it was said for real to him, but he always sorta had a feeling in the back of his head. Unless Garrosh spilled the beans off screen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, I'm starting to sense here that some &quot;ally&quot; of us is actual our enemy, how could Gul'dan know about Garrrosh being Grom's son? It doens't make any sense except for the fact that someone MUST have told him. And what about the &quot;Fulfill your destiny&quot; catchphrase he keeps using? In the WoD's begining cinematic I thought that was just something taht made sense at that time since the pit lord wanted them to drink his blood, but what if Gul'dan was talking about the &quot;real&quot; timeline, our timeline where the orcs HAVE IN FACT drank the blood ? He must know that we come from an alternate timeline, where the orcs drank the demon blood AND garry was grom's son.<br />
<br />
Now, who told him that? Archemage &quot;secretly-is-Medivh&quot; Khadgar? The demon lord that Gul'dan works for might know this? Or a third, misterrious choice?</div></div><hr />

Ok so I watched it again and your right Guldan does mention Garrosh as Groms son first and Grom does seem a little surprised at the information. But still I remember reading here on MMOChamp that Grom wasnt going to find out that Garrosh was his son.</div></div><hr />

Grom now knows that Garrosh was his son, Garrosh was the one that told him not to drink the blood for it made them slaves. In order to honor his son, it would be an insult not to heed his son's words. <br />
<br />
I think Kilrogg drinking the blood fulfills the idea of a warlord drinking the blood too. I find it redundant that they would go the same route for Grom as Kilrogg.<br />
<br />
And if Grom doesn't drink the blood there is no way he's an enemy in a raid. Right now, he's shackled up and has become a prisoner of his own horde, why would we free him just to fight him? <br />
<br />
My guess is Gul'dan has become the final boss or he's the end boss for Tanaan Jungle with Archimonde being a surprise end boss for 6.3.</div></div><hr />

that's the thing, he didnt know untill gul'dan brought him Gorehowl and said &quot;what about your son&quot;, you can clearly hear grommash say &quot;my, son?&quot; as in a question, before he sees the truth and realizes that garrosh actually was his son.</div></div><hr />

Also did I miss the parts where instead of telling us, they show that Garrosh and Grommash grew so close that Grommash would take the word of Gul'dan that Garrosh is his son and not immediately think &quot;oh it's this nut case again, he's probably trying to trick me into doing something stupid or drinking the mt dew because the word of warlocks channeling Palapatine who's own people betrayed him and we used to power the dark portal can totally be trusted&quot;?

Well, Blizz released the cinematic with his death ~1 month before the xpac even went live. Then If you played through Nagrand you got it again. So...kind of on the day of launch? I'm sure some people got through Nagrand by the end of that day.</div></div><hr />

Could be Kil'Jaeden in his full power.<br />

I still wonder what, they gonna do with Medivh.<br />
I really hope they doesn't just use him to a Plot device to get players the Ring.<br />

indeed it could but they said it won't be JUST an orc, meaning it won't be just some random orc we only encountered in WoD, might be we finaly face Grom.</div></div><hr />

<br />
mate trust me, Grom's reaction is of someone who just THEN realized the implication of Garrosh death. First he discovered he's dead, which he probably doesn't give 2 flying pigs about it, he could easily replace him with another orc for warchief of the warsong clan, but when Gul'dan tells him that Garrosh was in fact HIS SON, now shts got real, the killing of THAT orc became something personal. Obviusly he knew, in the back of his head, that Garry was familiar to him but didn't know he was his son. You are nuts to think that you could go to the past, meet your father and tell him you're his son, even though he doesn't have any kids since HE KILLED YOUR MOTHER (sorry for the comparison, but in WoD's timeline, Grom killed his mate, thus Garrosh was never born on this timeline). Garrosh would be killed if he even attempted to say he was his son.<br />
<br />
And you honestly believe such epic confronation when garrosh assumes he his Grom's son would not be portraied in game? If we haven't seen it before, not in game nor in books/comics, it's easy to assume he never told him.<br />
<br />
The question, now, is how did Gul'dan knew about this? It wasn't garrosh who told him, that's for sure, GArrosh didn't trust him in the 1st place</div></div><hr />

It's NPC-only armor baked into his model. It also has more shapes than our armor models have, so no.<br />

But Mythic Warlock T17 is based on Gul'dan's armor:<br />

Gul'dan knows about our timeline, hence why Khadgar is having a hard time tracking him down, because he is playing around him to not make the mistakes of OU Gul'dan.<br />

That's the point, isn't it? Regardless what universe or actions are done, destiny cannot be changed.<br />
Medivh said in Last Guardian book: &quot;Time is like an hourglass and each grain of sand represents an event that is yet to happen. Ragardless of what, the events eventually come to pass, the only question is WHEN.&quot;<br />
<br />
The only thing that can change are the players.<br />
Now Grommash is in the same shoes that Durotan was in our reality; and Kil'rog became this universe's Hellscream, the 1st to drink the demon blood.</div></div><hr />

No logging into a character required. It then is supposed to deduct the gold evenly across your characters. Say the token is 20k but your highest toon only has 5k although you have 30k across your account. If it took the gold only from one character, you'd be screwed. So instead it will take gold across all toons but not so much that it takes everything from one toon leaving you broke.<br />
<br />
As for the cinematic, I can see Grommash getting redeemed and joining us to fight Gul'dan. People whined about having two Hellscreams as end bosses for expansions so Blizzard changed their mind on Grommash a while back. Think it was part of some interview after the Blizzcon announcement, but seems most people still only remember the Blizzcon quote where Grommash was said to be the end boss. I could see one of the Burning Legion like Kil'jaeden or Archimonde being the end boss this time although Kil'jaeden twice ... not likely just for the same reason about the two Hellscreams. Archimonde or someone else more likely.<br />
<br />
I also can't help but think that the source of the demon blood this go round will either be part of the 6.2 raid or, if there's a 6.3 raid, it'll be in 6.3 as something we have to fight. Grommash will likely be in the same raid with a fight where we have to rescue him and he helps us in the final fight ... or second to last one if the real final boss ends up mythic only. Grommash then either ends up dying to redeem himself or he ends up helping to pick up the fragments of the various orc clains with Durotan after Gul'dan's toast.</div></div><hr />

Right, there's several other notable Annihilan, like Magtheridon, Azgalor, and Brutallus, all of whom have corrupting felblood. A simple explanation would be if their blood had differing effects; green skin, red skin, grey skin, spikes or no spikes, etc. Of course, rule of cool accounts for a lot, too.<br />
<br />
http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/wow.gamepedia.com/thumb/c/cf/Brutallus_art.jpg/756px-Brutallus_art.jpg<br />
<br />
I personally wouldn't mind seeing Brutallus again; he'd fit right in with a Shattered Hand raid wing.<br />
<br />
Kil'rogg's clan is also based in Tanaan, and already practices blood magic, so I expect we'll see plenty of them doing interesting things with demon blood.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, the transformation isn't to green orc. Seems green skin is the result of being tainted by Mannoroth, who is dead. I wonder whose blood Gul'dan offered the orcs this time... It could be Archimonde.<br />
<br />
The green skin isn't a result of demonic blood drinking. The green skin came about because the enviroment of draenor in the MU was so corrupted by fel magics it made the orcs there effected by the tainted environment, as in rise of the horde it shows durotan and draka, who never went near demons blood, saw each others brown skin pealing off to reveal green under it.</div></div><hr />

Sorry for being an asshole but for me it's another mess with the lore from Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Actually now that I think about it there's even precedence of Gul'dan summoning a pit lord. He summons Mongrethod to deal with the player in the final quest of the Talador chain. Maraad and Liadrin end up killing it. And that honestly seemed kind of spur of the moment.<br />
<br />
Honestly, after that cinematic it's a fair bet that there's going to be a pit lord boss in the next raid anyway with how heavily legion influenced it's looking like it's going to be. I don't really see how it's a mess with the lore thing when Gul'dan doesn't say where the blood came from in the cinematic either. He's been off doing his own thing for weeks now since we freed him from powering the Dark Portal, who knows what's really going on. In fact, in our timeline he reported directly to Kil'jaeden himself around the time the orcs first drank the blood so it's likely he still is now. I'd let it play out, then pass judgment on it. Not like getting upset over it is going to change anything anyway, it's their story. Who knows, you might even like it.</div></div><hr />

Honestly you deserved to be killed by warlocks if you didnt interrupt cb. I assume you hated them for pvp reasons.

I think they formed a pretty strong bond while they were making the iron Horde.

Grom is not stupid, he knew that there was something familiar about Garrosh when they first met in Draenor, this is said in one of the short stories, and with the pass of the expansion with the Horde and Alliance coming to Draenor and all the time travel stuff with the Kirin Tor and etc, it would be stupid to think that Grom still don't know that they are from another Universe/future...The words of Gul'dan was enough to make him realize about Garrosh, because deep inside he already knew.</div></div><hr />

His response sounds more so confused/surprised, the animation however makes him look sad like he had already known he was his son. It could have happened behind the scenes that somewhere along the lines he found out but who knows</div></div><hr />

Wrathion wants to rule the world so he backs to most powerful force. In MoP, he backed the Horde and then when Garrosh went crazy and isolated himself from allies, he backed the Alliance. Wrathion wanted Varian to assassinate the Horde Warchief at the end of the legendary questline but Varian opted for diplomacy which set Wrathion in a rage as he stormed out of his tavern at the completion of the questline. (Quest to kill Garrosh Hellscream). So it wouldn't be uncharacteristic of Wrathion to possibly use the legion as a tool to come to power.<br />

I doubt it literally means the final assault. They use the word final, liberally, but I doubt Grom will be the final boss. He no longer has an army and we now share a common foe, Gul'dan and his fel orcs (old Iron Horde). We will probably have to rescue Grom and take the fight to Gul'dan, especially since Khadgar won't rest until Gul'dan is taken from power.<br />
<br />
I certainly hope that it is not a short expansion as it would be disappointing to have an expansion contain so little content. In addition, you'd have to shell out another 60 bucks for the next expansion.</div></div><hr />

(Quest to kill Garrosh Hellscream). So it wouldn't be uncharacteristic of Wrathion to possibly use the legion as a tool to come to power.<br />

I doubt it literally means the final assault. They use the word final, liberally, but I doubt Grom will be the final boss. He no longer has an army and we now share a common foe, Gul'dan and his fel orcs (old Iron Horde). We will probably have to rescue Grom and take the fight to Gul'dan, especially since Khadgar won't rest until Gul'dan is taken from power.<br />
<br />
I certainly hope that it is not a short expansion as it would be disappointing to have an expansion contain so little content. In addition, you'd have to shell out another 60 bucks for the next expansion.<br />

i know this story i readed the books...but it does not have to be medivh involved in this...when they opened a portal a second time in beyond the dark portal there was no medivh...so it does not mean that the portal must invole medivh<br />

Probably because he felt that he didn't need to. In the cinematic, he tells Garrosh, &quot;This was not our destiny&quot; which meant he probably had a vision where everything was in compliance. When the fight ensued, he probably thought Mannoroth was going to win.</div></div><hr />

There are other pit lords, and there's precedence for their blood being used to create fel orcs. Remember Magtheridon in TBC?<br />
<br />
Kilrog turned grey instead of green. May not even be the blood of a pit lord.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking...<br />

<br />
Mal'Ganis.<br />
<br />
If it is him (original or AU) my interest went from 0 to 50. He's still at large in the original timeline, a loose end that needs not just being tied, but severed altogether. Azshara is #1 on my hitlist. Mal'Ganis is #2. I would be willing to subject myself to mythic lifestyle one last time to kill him.</div></div><hr />
