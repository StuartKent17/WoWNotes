Upcoming Garrison Outpost Hotfixes<br />
We're going to be seeing some changes to the gold prices of Garrison Outposts, and their follower specific quests, after the next maintenance period.<br />
We’re planning to make some changes to the Garrison Zone Outposts, to reduce the costs necessary to change out the building you initially chose while questing through the zone, and also allow you to earn the unique follower associated with alternate building choices.<br />
<br />
Specifically, these changes will be:<br />
The cost to change your Garrison Outpost building in Gorgrond, Talador, and Spires of Arak reduced to 5,000 gold The cost to change your Garrison Outpost building in Nagrand reduced to 500 gold Changing your Garrison Outpost building in a zone will also grant access to the building-specific questline for that zone, including the building-specific follower<br />
<br />
Note that you will still be unable to change your Garrison Outpost building until you’ve reached level 100 and earned your current building’s zone achievement, at which point the building can be changed by speaking with the outpost’s foreman NPC (who varies from building to building).<br />
<br />
These changes are currently not planned to go live until the next maintenance period for each region, but we wanted to give as much advance notice as possible that they’re on their way.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Because we are shamans for instance? We deserve some OP shit once in a while as all classes :D even when we are talking about movement speed (which you don't gain if in combat...) worked best for old dungeons and raids, I really don't understand why they changed it.</div></div><hr />

Just make all glyphs cosmetic already. Or better yet disable all glyphs for BG/Arena. They don't want professions to give you an edge in BG/Arena anyway.<br />

<br />
There is no reason whatsoever to nerf this glyph other than to kill the concept that shamans could finally be faster than infinite sprint rogues, blink druids, and god knows what else. <br />
It doesn't even work in combat for crying out loud.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
This stupid argument is getting old. Why should shamans always be the ones nerfed when they get something better than other classes, but god forbid other classes get that same treatment.<br />
Druids get fucking sprint on every spec. Give us Spirit Walk on every fucking shaman spec then if you want to pull us even !<br />
<br />
Also, druid travel form glyphed is faster than Shaman Ghost Wolf glyphed. We only run at 190% speed, whereas druids run at 200% speed. So I ask you: Why the fuck should druids be able to go 10% faster outdoors than shamans ?!?!</div></div><hr />

It was one of the few things left that a shaman had. Now it's gone. lol I'm honestly not sure why this was even removed.</div></div><hr />

You say this because you don't understand how mission pops work. You only gain a few level 100 missions a day. The level 95-99 missions are in addition to those. Without them you don't have nearly enough for your whole crew to work and you end up with far less salvage and thus less follower equipment and less chance for free ilvl 665 purples.<br />
<br />
Before this change you needed to keep a level 90 and 95 follower on staff at all times to avoid running out of missions. Additionally you need the level 90 on staff so you can have a chance for the dancing mission to pop (it's level 90 only). Also there is a retraining book mission at level 90 that you will want to be able to pop (there is also a 100, but twice the chance with 90 too). So you still need to keep the 90 on staff but at least now we can shelf the 95.<br />
<br />
If making mission teams is annoying to you there are several good addons that automate it entirely.</div></div><hr />

If all followers are 100 just give us level 100 missions. Your character is 100, does he go back and run level 95 dungeons? <br />

Absolutely true on all accounts; especially like your comment on Followers and Invasions -perhaps Invasions should scale with (epic?) Followers and actually present a challenge rather than the borefest of waves of 3-5 adds at a time. Invasions could be epic, give us swarms and show our Followers in action.<br />
<br />
It is now possible to continue to receive Level 95-99 missions even when all Followers are level 100.<br />

Please Roll Back these changes and make them go live with the scheduled maintenance, much like the garrison stuff I read above, which seems to have a decent heads up for preparation.

The alchemy changes are too large to suddenly take place in a random hot-fix with barely any heads up and no proper announcement. I read MMO, and by the time I got home from work yesterday, the changes became live in the first 20 minutes I was online. People with a schedule barely got to hear about the proposed/debated changes before it all went live, and were lucky if they got into the game in time to make use of their mats. This wasn't some broken-promise OP-item nerf that was required to preserve the integrity of new mythic raid content difficulty, so I can't see why it was so jarringly and rudely thrown at us when it could have been (and still could be) handled in a more satisfying way for everyone.</div></div><hr />

They already did in the last hotfix... only requires 1 exalted rep now. The text won't reflect that until we have to download something though, since they can't change client-side text strings in hotfixes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the 95-99 missions take 30-90 minutes, so you can queue up so of them while you're doing your heroics or daily apexis grind, and then when you're ready to log out you can get the crates from them and then queue up the level 100 ones (minimum time 4 hrs)</div></div><hr />

&quot;Ghost Wolf modified by Glyph of Ghostly Speed no longer provides a movement speed increase while indoors.&quot; <br />
You get slow all of a sudden, I can see a percent reduction but to make the glyph worthless indoors is silly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seems kind of rash to cancel based on the PvP viability of one spec - especially a newly implemented spec. You have to expect that any new classes/specs put into the game will have a lot of iteration on it even after beta (not enough comprehensive PvP participation on beta). Look at Death Knights; look at Monks.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, as a Shaman, while I'm disappointed to see the change to Ghostly Speed, I figured it was only a matter of time. You can't compare skills across different classes in a vacuum. Different classes are different. Also, doesn't Ghostly Speed provide a significant benefit in Challenge Mode dungeons?</div></div><hr />
