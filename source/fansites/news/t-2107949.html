If your talking about Kosumoth the hungering, he is a mini world boss that you can get after you have unlocked him. You can follow a guide like this which will unlock him for you. http://pwncastdailyquest.com/kosumoth-the-hungering-complete-guide-to-getting-the-world-quest/<br />
<br />
Once you have unlocked him it will spawn as world quest for you every second week were you can either get the mount or the pet from him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Didn't you pay attention? In the same post they stated, that the transmog sets will actually come from a quest, which will have you collect (grind) some quest-items from ToV bosses. This will probably take a few lockouts to be accomplished.<br />
<br />
Besides: The sets that were posted have an unique color-scheme, which deviates from those of any of these 4 difficulty colorings.</div></div><hr />

The thing is slow, not much better than swim speed honestly and from what I understand it doesn't even give you underwater breathing... (I was playing on my undead so I don't have to worry about lungs anyway)</div></div><hr />

<br />
the fishing artifact weapon however is pretty nice, 150% swim speed</div></div><hr />
