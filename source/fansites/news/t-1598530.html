Lords of War Part Five - Maraad<br />
We proudly present the epic conclusion to Blizzard Entertainment’s animated lore miniseries Lords of War! Watch the tale of draenei champion Vindicator Maraad, and then catch the entire series to learn about some of the other major players in the upcoming World of Warcraft expansion, Warlords of Draenor.<br />
<br />
Vindicator Maraad battled the demonic orcs of the first Horde. He witnessed the slaughter of his people in Shattrath. It was the draenei’s darkest day, and Maraad’s greatest test . . . and the memory of his actions have haunted him ever since.<br />

<br />
Im an horde player and an Orc player but I always liked the Draenei and Maraad was my favourite Draenei and probably the most notable after Akama/Velen along with Nobundo, its so shitty that ends up dying when the Dranei have no big figures right now, maybe Yrel comes to this Azeroth at the end of WOD.</div></div><hr />

Just goes to show though, every race can give in to bloodthirst and vengeance. 'twas a good finishing touch to the Lords of War series.</div></div><hr />

Gul'dan is not one of the Warlords. He is an enemy of the Iron Horde, no less so than we are.<br />

The Siege of Orgrimmar, among other things, has done a very good job of showing us that with or without demon blood, and with rare exceptions, the Orcs will never change.<br />
<br />
He dies in a quest regardless, so it's of little relevance regardless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a feeling that if the orcs keep themselves from becoming like that again then the humans will be the evil ones in their timeline. I think that Sargeras is within Medivh at this time, correct? Corrupt the humans to conquer foreign lands, maybe? We may destroy the Dark Portal on this side, but surely Medivh's portal was at least being built at this time as well, right? What will become of that?<br />

Orgrim was not shown at all.<br />

Maraad is the Draenei most invested in the fight against the Warlords.<br />

<br />
My thoughts exactly.<br />
<br />
I had hoped that, except for some travelling into other universes, the second half of the expansion would come as a surprise with the Dark Portal in Tanaaran Jungle activating itself, but except reinforcements from our universe or Iron Horde remnants a corrupted version of the Kingdom of Azeroth, lead by Varian's father and helped as secretly manipulated by Medivh invades the area. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately it won't come to this, yet I still hope that it is one of the expansion they plan. I mean using the lower half of alternate Azeroth would be cool, though not as cool as Draenor due to being mostly civilized.</div></div><hr />

To be honest, I would have preferred one on Gul'dan or something. That being said, WHY are they doing one on Maraad, building him up as a character, when he dies so early in the expansion?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because the Draenei need to be shown why their fight is important as well. So it's not just &quot;Well for all you know, your draenei doesn't give a shit about Draenor.&quot;<br />
<br />
They wanted two things:<br />
One: To get the Alliance invested in fighting on Draenor as well.<br />
Two: To show that even the most light-centered beings, who are focused on naught but good fortune and the well being of others, can succumb to bloodthirst and vengeance if pushed far enough.</div></div><hr />

Did they really? Does that mean that Aegwynn is alive? Would make sense honestly since we DID kill Cho'gall ourselves.<br />

<br />
And i was hoping this thread wouldn't have any alliance bitching about the non existent favoritism. Pathetic.<br />
<br />
Why do you think the Alliance complain about favoritism if it isn't really there? Also, just FYI, it's not just Alliance players that see the favoritism, it's a big part of the Horde players. I don't understand how you can deny it when the entire expansion is based on the horde history that we have to ENDURE because of fucking Garrosh Hellscream, the HORDE WARCHIEF. And no, I don't fucking care if it's the Iron Horde, it's still the ORCS. I'm so fed up with Orcs, I'm almost literally having nightmares that they'll make Azshara an Orc and make an expansion about her, then Sargeras an Orc and make an expansion about him.</div></div><hr />

Then bitch about Orc favoritism, not Horde favoritism.<br />

And yeah, killing our own Warchief is a perfect example of favoritism, right? If we had to sack Stormwind I'm pretty sure Alliance fanboys would bitch that Blizzard hates Alliance.</div></div><hr />

How about we don't get inside any City at all? Also, the whole Orgrimmar thing is so stupid, the city is completely intact. Now may I remind you of Theramore? I don't remember any Theramore level of destruction to have ever struck the horde. The only thing that comes close (and by close I mean, not really..), is the Jaina killing all the Dalaran people, and surprise surprise, the most important person ESCAPED.</div></div><hr />

Thing is... your warchief didn't get killed. We sat there, then we took the &quot;high road&quot;, and gave him a trial. After which he escapes, big surprise. Just because he dies in WoD doesn't mean SoO was satisfying in ANY capacity for Alliance. Honestly, with the way 5.3 was, it was more satisfying for Horde. Showing favoritism through storytelling. (i.e.-They just give Horde better story arcs, are more satisfying ones)</div></div><hr />

The Original horde cause far more damage to alliance than Deathwing ever had.<br />

It certainly was epic but it doesn't really change the central complaint. It doesn't tell us anything we don't already know about the Alliance/Horde status quo in WoD. It'll be a Horde focused expansion but thankfully with a bit more reason for the Alliance to be engaged in the story than in MoP.</div></div><hr />

Why are you even bringing up Theramore? It just proves my own point. Alliance players bitch about Theramore being destroyed, so surely Horde players should not be happy about attacking their own city.<br />

<br />
And how exactly was SoO satisfying for Horde at all? We were forced to attack our own city and kill Horde heroes like Nazgrim. And Garrosh living and escaping isn't satisfying for us, either.</div></div><hr />

You're right, let's completely forget how Grom was the best friend of Thrall, how he drank the Demon Blood, bound his people to the Burning Legion and then payed the ultimate price of death in order to FREE HIS PEOPLE the ORCS, thus becoming one of the biggest Horde Heroes to have ever existed.

But this video was actually good. It's everything i liked in wow and i hope wow come back to it, instead of this sandbox pvp and extra friendly relation between factions.<br />

It made me remember my old good days of world pvp in BC. I was horde and a good ally was a dead one. Now i'm mostly alliance and i can't care less about pvp, i have hope blizz realize the old pvp honor system titles should be brought back.<br />
<br />
Then Tom Chilton needs to feed his bull with arena and &quot;good&quot; players. I can't see &quot;good&quot; in a game with such class imbalance, but ok!<br />

Arena is OK, removing world pvp rewards is not. Is arena no shitty they need to remove the old rank system to tunnel people to it?<br />

I would like to have seen one one him and then some more on a few alliance folks as well. I feel like even as a horde player having stuff from the otherside story wise makes the game more interesting. I would love to see more on each Alliance player in Warlords. Maybe have a Garrosh and Grom talk like this Maraad and Varian chat. Were garrosh tells grom about the treat from his world coming through and focus on the Alliance characters and maybe throw in one on Thrall that just talks shit about him from Garrosh's point of view.

<br />
Why they didn't show Ner'zhul and Blackhand though is beyond me.<br />
<br />
Ner'zhul and Blackhand, though both enemies in WoD, would have been the least fitting for Maraad to speak of. For Ner'zhuls case, it's because Ner'zhul actually didn't have much of an impact in lore outside of his 'political' exploits and eventually being disposed of by Kil'jaeden. He didn't have any 'battle stories' like the other warlords. Little reason for Maraad to mention him because of his lack of importance(well, 'before' becoming the Lich King) and lack of stories to tell. <br />
<br />
For Blackhand's, I didn't realize until just today that he wouldn't have made sense anyways. Blackhand didn't gain true notoriety or depth until he was 'elected' by the Shadow Council and the Horde, which no matter what differences the AU has, would have just happened chronologically. Sure, they could have made up another small story about him from his 'youth', but even reading Rise of the Clans, it's clear he's not that interesting of a character to have any notable stories about(perceived as dumb and reckless by the Orcs until he was appointed Warchief, hell he even knew people thought of him as a dumb brute, still feared, but not....'respected' shall I say). Hell, even after 'electing' him to Warchief, Guldan invited him onto the Shadow Council only to make him 'think' he was actually important when he was nothing more than a puppet. <br />
<br />
No, Blackhand's only major stories that would have been heard far and wide would be from the other side of the Dark Portal. I'm actually curious to see how he's perceived in general in WoD since he's not 'warchief' in this timeline, but takes a much more fitting role of a siege commander of sorts. It's probably the only thing other than 'warchief' I could see him as.</div></div><hr />

Silence some complainers?

<br />
Blackhand took control later on, so wasn't all that important, but Ner'zhul is the most important Orc of this time period. He spoke, and everyone from ever clan shut up and listened. Guldan didn't get the Orcs to kill Draenei, no one did but Ner'zhul... and he did it by being tricked. And he regretted it deeply. <br />
<br />
I loved the Kilrogg video, but the answer to Varians question should have been Ner'zhul. He was their spiritual leader, their messiah. He was chosen by Kil'jaedin because no other orc had his influence over the others. This guy didn't throw sand in the air and listen to whispers after hours of preparing some ritual, the ancestors appeared to him like nothing. He didn't ask the elements to please not do this or please do that, he made them kill when he was angry. Of all the Orcs to take part in the killings of the Draenei, Ner'zhul never once did, he even wanted to die for what he had done...<br />
<br />
I don't know why he doesn't get attention like the others do lately, he legit was Thrall before Thrall was Thrall.<br />

I really have a feeling that this is going to be the Alliance expansion we need.

in the context of WoD they are not &quot;our&quot; horde figures though, they're the bad guys we are going to put down. so why we need to paint this as red Vs blue is beyond me. either way I just want to see more shorts for shits n giggles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Grats! At least you're not being obnoxiously shoe-horned into the story to the point that you are just a blundering bystander. Also your &quot;Fist bump moment&quot; (Chris Metzen, 2014) isn't the opposite faction leader saving the day. The entire story/expac is based around a race and the origin from your faction and you're still not happy?<br />

Why are you even bringing up Theramore? It just proves my own point. Alliance players bitch about Theramore being destroyed, so surely Horde players should not be happy about attacking their own city. <br />
<br />
The difference being that Theramore was destroyed, Orgrimmar was not! However I can totally imagine all the people RPing that the place is in shambles but it really looks fine, it makes me lol.</div></div><hr />

No Maraad, Varian has learned fuck all from your griping about the Warlords and telling your honour boner stories about them. I mean what about Blackhand, Ner'zhul, Gul'dan and Doomhammer? You know guys who absolutely shat over your entire race and reduced them to hiding in Marshes which to be frank doesn't label you as a Warlord considering you were evading extinction just by chance. Also seems that he is a pretty shit Paladin considering he will go after a no name Orc instead of protecting people who are in massive danger. I literally cannot fathom how Varian can be okay with having Maraad lead the charge unto Draenor when less than 30 seconds ago he just admitted to being a shitlord at protecting those he is meant to defend and really wants to part of the force that repels the Iron Horde just so he can kill moar Orcs to feel better about being a shit Paladin.</div></div><hr />

It was already an alternate timeline. In the short story, Kairoz mentions that it was a timeline perfect for Garrosh because Grom didn't have any children in this alternate timeline. The infinite dragonflight were trying to end/negate our timeline; Garrosh is using an alternate timeline to attack our present. I think. Time travel is confusing.</div></div><hr />

You think Garrosh travelled back to OUR past and then an alternate universe spawned....thats wrong. The infinite dragonflight travelled to OUR past and try to change it. Garrosh travelled to an ALTERNATE timeline that already exist like many others timelines out there. <br />
<br />
The infinite dragonflight travelled to OUR past.<br />
Garrosh travelled to an ALTERNATE timeline....so the situations you mentioned are not the same.<br />

He spoke, and everyone from ever clan shut up and listened. Guldan didn't get the Orcs to kill Draenei, no one did but Ner'zhul... and he did it by being tricked. And he regretted it deeply. <br />
<br />
I loved the Kilrogg video, but the answer to Varians question should have been Ner'zhul. He was their spiritual leader, their messiah. He was chosen by Kil'jaedin because no other orc had his influence over the others. This guy didn't throw sand in the air and listen to whispers after hours of preparing some ritual, the ancestors appeared to him like nothing. He didn't ask the elements to please not do this or please do that, he made them kill when he was angry. Of all the Orcs to take part in the killings of the Draenei, Ner'zhul never once did, he even wanted to die for what he had done...<br />
<br />
I don't know why he doesn't get attention like the others do lately, he legit was Thrall before Thrall was Thrall.<br />

Yeah, I see what you mean about Ner'zhul from a perspective of actually within the game(Like Literally, Maraad hasn't been into the &quot;AU&quot; Draenor yet I believe in this), but Ner'zhul is the most dramatically changed of all the characters from the original world. Obviously all these stories are about MU versions of these characters, so there are differences, but none as big as AU to MU Ner'zhul. To any players who aren't read up on Ner'zhul(sad as it is to say there are :P), they'd see this video of a great Shaman being deceived, then see the....very, VERY different Ner'zhul of WoD. It's not a story that even fits for bringing back in players to the story who actually knew about Ner'zhul's story.<br />
<br />
Lol, it's hard to explain what I'm getting at, but I understand what you're saying. It's mostly small details really when it comes down to it. I don't think many are bothered by him not being shown, but at the same time, I don't think anyone(even me) would mind if they did do a vid on Ner'zhul. I'm just curious, what would the content of it be? All the previous ones have been battle tales(hence the series title, &quot;Lords of War&quot;). Ner'zhul's stories involving any type of battle are very few. Hell, if I remember correctly Draenei hadn't even truly declared War yet had they? I'll have to pop out Rise of the Horde again, but I do remember Ner'zhul losing his position to Guldan and Velen being released by Durotan being very, very close chronologically.</div></div><hr />

Garrosh just did it. :P And if dimensional boundaries can't be crossed then humans will never be able to prove existence of other universes.<br />

The story is decent, at least as decent as a wow story can get</div></div><hr />

Why do you think the Alliance complain about favoritism if it isn't really there? Also, just FYI, it's not just Alliance players that see the favoritism, it's a big part of the Horde players. I don't understand how you can deny it when the entire expansion is based on the horde history that we have to ENDURE because of fucking Garrosh Hellscream, the HORDE WARCHIEF. And no, I don't fucking care if it's the Iron Horde, it's still the ORCS. I'm so fed up with Orcs, I'm almost literally having nightmares that they'll make Azshara an Orc and make an expansion about her, then Sargeras an Orc and make an expansion about him.<br />
<br />
Aegwynn was killed when theramore blew up, along with Rhonin, something which apparently blizzard didnt consider important enough to actually explain in the game &gt;&lt;<br />
Also, anything that hugely derails from the game, should probably be considered non-canon, or as an alternate universe. Things like Varians story in the comic and the Arthas novel are incompatible with the game and with the info on the official website, so should be considered alternate universes or fan fiction (the Arthas novel was denied ingame even after it was released, so it cannot be considered a retcon, the book is NOT canon and cannot take place in the same universe as the story of the game). A bit like Maraads story about the warlords here; there is overlap, but it is not neccesarily 100% valid, as he only recounts the official timeline, so small things may vary in the wod timeline.<br />
<br />
Also, i would not say its based around the horde purely, for alliance players it is a chance to relive Warcraft 2 and probably some of the events covered in Btdp. One thing i dont quite get though, is how there can be a younger version of certain characters from azeroth, as their azeroth is purely ours. Unless, as mentioned elsewhere, we will see alternate universe azeroth invade alternate universe draenor, as it end up with the demons unable to corrupt the orcs and so corrupting the humans instead to take out the draenei on draenor. <br />
<br />
Anyway, the main point of the story in these cinematics apply just as much to the horde; they have lost all their greatest heroes and the orcish race has almost been decimated after the events of pandaria, so for them it is a chance to try and save some of these heroes and hopefully bring the iron horde into the horde proper. Just imagine what would happen to the balance of power in azeroth if the orcs get even a part of their full strenght back especially after the alliance probably ending up close to completely exhausted (it took the full might of ALL the human kingdom, the high elves, the dwarves, and some of the gnomes to even fight them in the first place, and even then they lost that war until the betrayal of gul'dan) from casualties sustained during pandaria and WoD. Now throw in people like Doomhammer, Durotan, and possibly ner'zhul and Hellscream (doubt it, since he will be the last boss and alliance needs a cinematic too, so he is 99% certain to get corrupted by the legion and killed) and the alliance is seriously at the mercy of the horde. <br />
<br />
Remember, the alliance barely made it into orgrimmar, fighting against ONLY THE ORCS...sorry...ONLY A SMALL PART OF THE ORCS, with assistance of the other horde races, after those orcs had been severely weakened by the darkspear rebellion, which means the alliance already did not stand a chance against the full might of the horde if it had been united. For all of varians empty bravado, they are not in a strong position, so i guess this will be just as much a story about the horde rising like a phoenix and i can easily see vol'jin at some point throwing varians &quot;we will end ya!&quot; back in his face.</div></div><hr />

The orc that Maraad saw was the same one that participated in the brutal fighting that Maraad personally witnessed earlier. But other than that, the orc was a nobody. Just think of him as &quot;Random Orc #27694&quot;.</div></div><hr />
