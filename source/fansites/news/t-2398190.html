Battle for Azeroth - 18 Characters Per Realm<br />
In case you missed the updated tip in the latest beta build (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7600-Battle-for-Azeroth-Beta-Build-26608#chartip), Battle for Azeroth will allow you to have 18 characters per realm. The 50 characters per account cap remains in place. <br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/may/bfaCharSlots.png&quot; alt=&quot;In Battle For Azeroth, the per-realm character limit will be going up from 16 to 18 to make room for the two new Allied Races (Dark Iron dwarves and Mag’har orcs).&quot; /&gt; (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/997587864308277248) <br />

This Week in WoW History<br />
We're taking a look back at old MMO-Champion posts and World of Warcraft news that occurred during this time in previous years.<br />
<br />
Encounter Journal<br />
Before the release of Firelands, the Encounter Journal was added to the PTR. This tool was one of the biggest changes for the raiding scene at the time, because it introduced an in-game tool for players to read before fighting a boss. Prior to the Encounter Journal, players only had access to third party sources to get familiar with encounters. This new Journal provides information about boss abilities, loot, and model preview.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Cloud Serpents<br />
Mists of Pandaria brought a new mount model to the game; the Cloud Serpent. These mounts became iconic for the expansion. Multiple color variations were added as rewards for various things, from quests, to reputations and rares. Some of the rare ones, such as the Onyx Cloud Serpent are still farmed today because of their rarity.<br />
<br />

<br />
Patch 5.3: Escalation<br />
The third content patch of Mists of Pandaria added a few Heroic Scenarios, the continuation of the Legendary Quest line, mounts, an Arena, and a Battleground. A few storyline quests were also added to further the story in the Razor Hill area. The Darkspear Rebellion faction was also added with some new item sets. The new mounts that were added include the Enchanted Fey Dragon, a store mount, the Hearthsteed, reward for playing Hearthstone, the Armored Dragonhawks, and the Brawler’s Burly Mushan Beast.<br />

<br />
Mount Preview<br />
The Grinning Reaver was teased on Twitter with a screenshot of the mount and the caption “IS THAT A SADDLE?”. It was later confirmed that this would become a store-mount added in Patch 5.4.8.<br />

Overwatch Short - Dragons<br />
This animated short tells the story of two brothers, Hanzo and Genji. During his yearly visit to the Shimada Temple, Hanzo is attacked by yet another assassin. After a scene with stunning fight choreography, he learns the truth about his attacker.<br />

<br />
Destiny 2<br />
In 2017, Bungie announced their collaboration with Blizzard to bring Destiny 2 to Battle.net. This first-person action game was announced with the “Rally the Troops” reveal trailer. The first Destiny game was a console exclusive, which many people hoped would come to the PC. With the release of the second game, this provided a perfect opportunity to reach a different audience through their deal with Blizzard.<br />

<br />
Wowhead does it too, and I actually click on them and see people commenting about them. I think after the announcement of classic, people have become more nostalgic again. I share your opinion though, but as long as I see commenting on them on both here and Wowhead, not much reason to discontinue it (like WoW youtubers focus on historical stuff too with some measure of success. there's an audience). I guess you could say its borderline content kind of like the Ghostcrawler stuff, but yea, people comment on the GC stuff too. Definitely not for everyone though, and that's ok. I personally skip out on it too. Maybe its also people who never played back then who like to read these.<br />
<br />
The only real concession I would make is that yeah, they do take up a good amount of space considering each event needs its own image, and maybe something could be done on that front. Or just keep it to WoW stuff instead of Destiny 2 (which isn't all that popular nowadays). OTOH, you can tell they're trying to heavily crop each image so it doesn't take up too much space, but I think it could be limited to like 4 WoW things personally (instead of 4 WoW, 1 OW, 1 Destiny 2)</div></div><hr />

Because, according to them, there is &quot;no feasible need for more than 50 characters&quot;</div></div><hr />

They're not pets to need attending to, but each and every character could have certain attachments for the player. It's a fractional data increase for what it provides; the possibility to make more characters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They increased the per server earlier this year, but the account total hasn't changed. It has been stuck at 50 characters max for as long as I can remember with the game.<br />
<br />
Blizz should increase it to 75. The actual number of players that would utilize more than 50 characters is pretty minimal so it shouldn't be much of a data strain, while it would allow those few players to create new characters without deleting existing ones. This is extremely useful with Allied Races now coming out in droves. I know a handful of people who are sitting at 50 with no chars they are willing to delete (nostalgia, banks, actually play, etc.), preventing them from enjoying Allied Races without sacrificing something they love.</div></div><hr />

Even if they allow a million chars on a server per account, there can be only 1 active at a time, so I don't think it is performance issue.</div></div><hr />

They would rather you start a second account if you want more character slots. Though I would be willing to pay for more slots. Maybe 10-20 dollars for 10 more slots?</div></div><hr />

<br />
BfA gets released mid-August, so pre-patch gets released Mid-July probably, so they could prepare the pre-patch PTR for June which would be online for approx 90 days until it's live, which is afaik a pretty normal gap from PTR to live... also a higher amount of people could test the class changes (since unlike Beta there is no invite required) then and there will be more feedback (as we saw at Balance Druids and Affliction Locks feedback isn't for nothing).</div></div><hr />

This is way more reasonable in comparison to paying for a 2nd account with characters you only play on occasion.</div></div><hr />

it sucks indeed that you need to delete characters every time you want to start something new again because friends started on a new server while other friends stopped playing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah. There's no way I'm removing characters, and I can't race change to the allied races without missing out on the heritage armor, so I'm shit out of luck. Won't be using Allied Races at all, I guess.</div></div><hr />

The comment I quoted made it seem as if people on non-connected Servers (big servers) were at a disadvantage, while they have other advantages to those playing on the small connected servers. (recruitement and a community being one of them)</div></div><hr />

I'm sick of having to delete toons, I'm really almost out of toons I'm fine with deleting, sure I may not play it, but it was like my first real one, or i have people on that server.<br />
<br />
How are they trolling us? Not their fault you have way way more alts than 99% of the playerbase. People like you, no matter how many character slots there are, will always want more. Classic n+1 scenario.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i like them, if they show something important. seems kinda pointless this time around.<br />
<br />
and sadly they rarely show something that goes back to tbc, classic or even wotlk..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard also needs to store the data associated with each character. However I imagine the amount of disk space required to store each character would be quite small.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">revjiggs</div><div class="date">2018-05-20, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with the fact the 50 is enough. The most important thing to remember is memory. Everyone getting 10 my chatacters slots overall means more space taken up on the data servers. You can't activley play 50 characters. I currently have 14 (I do a lot of house keeping) and I rarley play activley on more than 5 -6. I get that there is a degree of attatchment to characters as I am very attatched to my main but thats becuase I have spent lot of time on it. I you were to spend an equal amount of time on all 50 chatacters in the space of a week you would only spend 3.36 hours on each character <br />
and thats without factoring in work , school or even sleep.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People complaining about the character slot cap always seem to come off sounding like that one lady from the Hoarders tv show who couldn't bear to part with her entire garage literally full of broken vacuum cleaners because she &quot;could fix them up and make some real money&quot;.<br />
<br />
On the other hand...<br />
<br />
Blizzard apparently considers running a parade of alts through stale content to be an enriching experience.</div></div><hr />
