New Lore: Council of Three Hammers Story Available!<br />
Already embroiled by its own internal strife, the fledgling Council of Three Hammers is put to its greatest test yet when mounting tensions between the rival Bronzebeard, Wildhammer, and Dark Iron dwarf clans threaten to ignite violence in Ironforge.<br />
<br />
The city of Kurdran's ancestors was a simmering cauldron of old prejudice. It churned endlessly, its toxic fumes dissolving whatever logic and reason remained within the Bronzebeard, Wildhammer, and Dark Iron dwarves living together in Ironforge for the first time in over two centuries. And Kurdran was standing at the edge of it all, gazing into its fiery heart with confusion as it grew closer and closer to erupting.<br />
<br />
In an unsettling way he felt as if he were still at war with the blood-cursed Horde and trapped on Outland. Yet there were no clear enemies in Ironforge. No crazed demons. No rampaging orcs bent on decimating all life on his world. There were only words.<br />
<br />

You forgot the H though, so it's more like<br />

Lord Anty Christ -- or Lord Anti Chryst<br />
<br />
<br />
Either way, I think the model looks absolutely awesome :) Glad to see Blizzard hasn't lost their creativity since the first tier, and didn't decide to go with just another Molten Core design(bosses the same looks as regular mobs)</div></div><hr />

It's not like Cataclysm shipped with any new model files on bosses. *cough* Halfus, Omnotron, Maloriak, Chimeron, Atramedes, Conclave, Al'akir, Ascendant council, Cho'gall *cough*</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destrina</div><div class="date">2011-04-16, 06:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm guessing it comes from this word:<br />
<br />
Cist: A cinerary urn.<br />
<br />
Cinerary: Of or pertaining to ashes.<br />
<br />
With Anthry being a version of the prefix anthro.<br />
<br />
Anthro: Greek prefix meaning 'Man' (as in mankind, not the gender).<br />
<br />
So basically, an anthromorphized jar of ashes. Which, from the picture looks about right.</div></div><hr />

Can't you players for once, even if for 1 minute. Be satisfied with what you get?<br />
<br />
&lt;3 the new model and name. Yes Antichrist was what popped in my head as well, but he doesn't look like the pope. So can't be the real one.<br />
<br />
Daily Blink is epic as usual.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Durandro</div><div class="date">2011-04-16, 06:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the video link. Definately a Fester/Rot model. Doesn't look terrible, but certainly looks very clumsy and lumbering. Now we'll have to see if his fight suits him (i.e. I expect it'll be a tank and spank style fight, with him not moving much and doing ground slams. Pure guesswork, but we'll see).</div></div><hr />

And Rotface/Festergut is just a reskin of the Pustulent Horror.<br />

Its a new model. It's using the same skeleton has ogres. But its definetly a new model and not just a reskin.<br />
Otherwise, you could argue every single boss ever is a reskin.</div></div><hr />

The babble of voices at the entrance to the High Seat died down, and Advisor Belgrum, a wizened dwarf standing at the foot of the platform, bowed.

I get really tired of people calling it a reskin.<br />
All antichrist shares is a base skeleton. Like pterrodaxes and bats, or Loken and Thrym. <br />
This is a completely new model. A reskin is using the same model with different art over it. Like Stockade Pauldrons and Symbolic Pauldrons. Rotface and festergut are recolors, and share the same skins.</div></div><hr />

And if an already created skeleton works for a model...why not reuse it. Are you mad because maybe an idle emote that you rarely see will be the same? -.- If you think that this guy is a reskin i.e. using the same physical form with a different color as rotface/festergut - you should really get your eyes checked (or take a look at rotface again)<br />

Yes, OBVIOUSLY! Because everyone knows what antrhrashite is or whatever it's spelled like... the point it's SLOPPY to choose a name that so easily would associate with a more famous one like Antichrist and like someone said above, before easter...nice touch...although probably unintentional.<br />

Anthracite - I imagine it's a variation of that word and the association with anti-christ is just people not being familiar with the variation it's more similar to, which isn't a surprise considering I've just heard of anthracite 5 minutes ago. If people actually complain about this then they are just wanting to be insulted and not looking for what the word is actually referring to in a sort of synonym type of way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The male Taurens' horns stick into their arm while casting. If you play a troll, 2H weapons stick through your cape. Shoulder items are asymmetrically positioned, even sticks into you at some points. Weapons going through different parts of your body while attacking. Capes stick into many type of mounts. The list goes on, and all these have been in the game since 6,5 years. Why are you surprised Blizzard re-uses skeletons and / or models? Be glad Bosses at least a bit differ now from common mobs... (in memoriam Baron Geddon and Garr who looked exactly like earth and fire elementals, just a &quot;bit&quot; bigger)<br />

Oh, I'm sure the similarity to Antichrist was quite intentional. But where was the outrage over Lucifron and Gehennas? Geddon and Ragnaros himself are both named for apocalyptic stories.

That is reskinned Rotface , alot of people dont realise difference between model and skin <br />
<br />
Example: U take Rotface's model , change colors and some minor details and voila = Ozruk<br />
U take same model and change colors and add some fiery shit coming from his back with smoke = Lord Anthycyst (not to mention it shares same animations)<br />
<br />
Look at Sinestra , she is basicly reskinned KJ from sunwell &gt;.&gt; (reason why her body size is different is because of visual modification meaning it only appears different visualy)<br />
<br />
Same with Cata drakes such as sandstone,vitreous etc , Blizzard carefully added spikes and thats it , they will say its different model but it aint.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People these days. &quot;Liek omg dey r recyclin all modelz lulz QQ&quot;<br />
<br />
Deathwing - boring ancient dragon skin since vanilla with different skin<br />
<br />
Ysera - same thing as deathwing, old dragon slightly changed<br />
<br />
Ragnaros - slightly changed shoulders/head added legs hardly any effort<br />
<br />
Halfus - ok maybe i'll agree the Ettins are new models, but unique? no Throngus uses his model as well<br />
<br />
Cho'gall - i beleive it's just a reskinned Double headed Ogre model, not 100% sure<br />
<br />
Magmaw - Crustburster from Outland, maybe something even older has the same skin, not unique model, slightly changed a bit<br />
<br />
Maloriak - haven't seen him personally in movement but as far as i'm aware he is unique.<br />
<br />
Throne Bosses - typical Ragnaros swirling cloud thing with reskinned torso, nothing amazing<br />
<br />
Malfurion - updated Night elf model<br />
<br />
Garrosh - i can't tell if they use the Ogre Model or some other hideous creature of which to make Garrosh out of, his skin may be unique but his model isn't<br />
<br />
and so far that Anticryst dude whatever his name is uses the Ogre skeleton and some modified version of Ozruk's Skin</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really don't see how anyone wouldn't notice the anti christ when looking at the name. Blizzard can't possibly be stupid enough to not have seen it. The company has hundred+ people working for it and nobody saw it? Please. It fits their theme with several other fire bosses also have satanic-esque names (lucifron for example) wich makes sense because hell is most often seen as a pit of fire, wich this would be.<br />
<br />
<br />
is don't like the name one bit, because it will only result in religeous bashing on those people that are offended by it. <br />
<br />
Those people deserve to be bashed. Nobody gives a damn about if they get offended and the sheer arrogance that they actually think people do is annoying enough.<br />
<br />
Religious people can start being offended when they stop being offensive.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will burn in eternal hellfire for all eternity for being gay, but please stop insulting me by naming a boss after a character from my religion, that's offensive&quot;</div></div><hr />

You care to design some new models? I mean, you seem to know so much about them - so why not go ahead and design some new ones for Blizzard, I'm sure they'll be excellent. Although, I have no idea what you're babbling on about.<br />
<br />
Deathwing and Ysera ARE dragons, they're going to look like Dragons, not proto-dragons, not whelps, not some half human half dragonkin form, they are Dragons - be thankful they've had skin changes to look awesome.<br />
<br />
How about we turn Ragnaros from the awesome model we saw in Vanilla to a pony? He's going to look like Ragnaros' old model because.. well.. he is Ragnaros.<br />
<br />
Cho'gall looks nothing like normal Ogres, I suggest you take a look at him.<br />
<br />
Magmaw is the same kind of creature as the Crustannoyers in Hellfire besides the fact he resides in Lava - What would you suggest we do besides changing his skin from horrible red to glowing lava, add more detail to his entire body and head, more shiny glowing effects to keep the kids dazzled.<br />
<br />
Maloriak is based on Worgen, but looks nothing like anything we've seen before.<br />
<br />
Throne, typical? It was used on Rangaros, Thunderaan and Murmur and even those three have skin changes.<br />
<br />
Malfurion - Updated night elf model? Well, it's not going to be an updated Dwarf model is it? He is, after all.. a night elf.</div></div><hr />

Can't you players for once, even if for 1 minute. Be satisfied with what you get?<br />

&lt;3 the new model and name. Yes Antichrist was what popped in my head as well, but he doesn't look like the pope. So can't be the real one.<br />
<br />
Daily Blink is epic as usual.<br />
<br />
^ This ^, pretty much spot on.<br />

The fact it sounds like Anti-Christ isn't exactly life/game changing... or is it?<br />

and so far that Anticryst dude whatever his name is uses the Ogre skeleton and some modified version of Ozruk's Skin<br />

I have no clue what anthracite is and never even heard of it. I don't research coal nor do I care for geology. From reading all 10 pages of this thread, it's pretty obvious how few have heard of it as well. People often see what they want to see and people often misread things. The Daily Blink comic shows that extremely well. Dyslexia also plays a part in how people see things. People often transpose letters. There was a study done some years ago that stated if the first and last letters of a word are the same but the middle letters are jumbled, you can still read the word. It's how we can largely understand netspeak and shorthand without a cheat sheet as well as understand poorly written posts with horrible spelling. Look at how many mispell rogue. I've seen it as rouge constantly and yet we still understand it as rogue. Antichrist, Antiracist, and Anthrycist are very similar with several letters in the same location hence why many saw it as Antichrist with some more seeing it as Antiracist long before they saw it as anthracite. Only those that knew of anthracite likely saw it that way first. Due to how few know geology or work in coal mines compared to how many know of the Antichrist (whether you're religious or not) shows who views Anthrycist as Antichrist or Anthracite. Hate to say it, but those that know Antichrist will likely win out this argument since they far outnumber those that know about anthracite. Blame it on the way we view words, not on one's religion or on Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Will Blizzard change the name? Not likely. If you're really offended by it, file a legal complaint. Maybe if enough file one, Blizzard will change the name although not likely. Best case would be Blizzard avoiding using easily misread names in the future. Or you can just quit playing. If you don't raid, then that's a plus for you because you'll never see the boss anyway.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Selkhet</div><div class="date">2011-04-16, 07:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Obviously people here don't have a clue of how animated 3D models are produced. As far as production is concerned, yes, this is a new 3D model. It has new features, a new texture, obviously needed work from artists. What is reused is the rigging, the invisible skeleton that goes inside the model. This is used to animate the models, by setting the movement frame by frame, using the positioning of &quot;bones&quot; and &quot;joints&quot;.<br />
<br />
New models are relatively easier to make, specially for a game like WoW, where models got to have a decent polygon count to not overwhelm gamers with older computers. Videogames usually have simple models and put the most amount of art and detail in the textures, which are much lighter. Anthicyst's texture is pretty new and shiny, and looks like it did take some work, as well as the model itself, even though it was probably based on an existing model.<br />
<br />
What is completely UNREASONABLE to demand are new rigs every single patch. A good rig, with all it's animations, can take MONTHS to be done. And then you have all the work to wrap the model around it and make it animate in a way that doesn't distort the polygons or look weird. That's why all dragons use the same rig, even though they have different models. Sometimes the job is so well done that you don't notice. For example, I remember having read somewhere that dwarves and tauren use the same skeleton, even though they have different animation sets. And then there's the more obvious one, like male tauren and broken draenei, or ogres and moonkin, but it doesn't mean they share the same models.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, model =/= texture =/= rig, learn to animate in 3D before calling other people lazy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lord anthricyst (or anthrycist, still no clue) has an entirely unique model and skin. You can look at rotface, there is a hole in his leg that is not present in lord anthricyst. Look at orzuk, several pieces of him are floating around, and his head is an equal distance from both of his sides. Lord anthricyst has his head displaced slightly to the right (while looking at him). All of these things require an entirely new model to create, and require entirely new skins to fit the models properly.<br />
<br />
That said, he does use a similar animation set to ogres or festergut/rotface. But considering how long the game has been going on, it would be difficult to make entirely new animation sets that still look good while being noticeably different. Would you rather had a good reused animation than a new animation that looks like shit?<br />
<br />
Not to mention, the animations may be changed slightly to avoid stretching issues (as seen in a video where he was walking).<br />

<br />
That depends on what you mean by &quot;reskinned&quot;. <br />
<br />
I've always seen &quot;reskinned&quot; and &quot;retextured&quot; as the same thing. This is a &quot;reshaped&quot; AND &quot;reskinned&quot; model, i.e. if you took the texture from this mob and DIRECTLY applied it to Rotface/Festergut, then it wouldn't actually appear exactly the same.<br />
<br />
Either way, it's Rotgutfesterface appearance is mostly caused by the same stance/animation set being used, apply it to any model in game and suddenly it's a &quot;festerface reskin omlolz&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm amazed so few people know the difference between a model and a skeletal structure. Maybe I don't read these comments enough - are people here really that stupid? The &quot;model&quot; for Anthricyst bears no resemblance whatsoever to Rotface.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, it scares the crap out of me too. Three core elements to a &quot;being&quot; within a video game. Skeleton(stance/animation), model(shape/structure) and texture(skin/effects). Two of the three of theses are completely unique, although the model would have been worked from a template that is free of viserrors, but that's about as far as it's relationship with the Rotface mob goes.<br />
<br />
The reason that the skeletons are used over and over and over again is because they are so time consuming to produce. As mentioned, once a skeleton is made, the model is then applied, they then test for visual errors and tweek the model until it fits the skeleton with the least amount of visglitches as possible. <br />
<br />
For an example of how bad a model can look when applied to a skeleton that does fit it, look back at Cata's beta and look at what happened to the troll model when the Human skeleton was applied to it.</div></div><hr />

She actualy just uses his animations, and compared to her old model, which if you wanna play the &quot;reskin&quot; game, was exactly like Onyxia's, so it's newer.<br />

Just scrap wow and go back to the Gold Release version of this game, every change you ever make, every peice of art, quest, lore, story class ballance only causes people to whine. Why give them a model when you could just give them a mountain giant of a different colour, they will only resent you for trying.</div></div><hr />

Jesus christ the laziness of developers these days just simply astounds me. Its like they can't even be bothered to try anymore......<br />
I long for the days when newly released models were original and well thought out.<br />
But this....THIS!!!!!!<br />
Everyone knows anthracite burns blue blizzard, and your decision to make him red is the reason I'm quitting the game.<br />
<br />
Ahhh, this made me laugh so hard. I for one didn't actually see antichryst when i first saw it, and i cant see how one would</div></div><hr />

We associate the name to &quot;anti Christ&quot; because we've seen or heard of it before, more than the word &quot;Anthracite&quot; (which is most likely what they based it on)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can see that I am not the only one reads &quot;antichrist&quot;. Antichrist is a god to some people, so doesn't Blizzard violate their own rules with a name like this? If it is indeed intended to be a play on the word antichrist - which they have noticed themselves without a doubt. <br />
<br />
Delicate area... I guess.<br />
<br />
the model is made out of coal most likely his name i anthricyst(or something) which is most likely based of a type of coal rather than some religious deity last time i checked anti christ was not a lump of coal... so no they are not violating anything since the name is based on coal rather than the anti christ.</div></div><hr />

It's sacrilegious, not racist. Tell me, to you also say something is ironic when it's coincidental, or that something is an oxymoron when it's a pleonasm, or literal when you're refering to something metaphorical?<br />
<br />
If you're going to judge someone, make damn sure you know what you're judging them of. As a person that is religious, I'm sure you don't need to be reminded about why you're suppose to be very wary when judging people.<br />
<br />
Feel free to judge me for saying damn. I'm sure if I go through your posting history I wont find any examples of hypocrisy, oh, and please don't confuse that for irony either.</div></div><hr />

to be fair he is based on a type of coal rather than a deity, also christians need to be a little less sensitive then it comes to such names instead of just crying about it.. anthrchycist is no where near being anti christ... people are just seeing what they want to see.</div></div><hr />
