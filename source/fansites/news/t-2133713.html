Upcoming PTR Legendary Changes<br />
As we mentioned this during the live Q&amp;A last week, we feel the biggest shortcoming of the current Legendary system is that, for some specs, there are some items that are clearly better than others in nearly all situations. As a result, players who have received a different Legendary item feel unlucky, as they didn’t receive the “best” one.<br />
<br />
So, we’re making some fairly substantial changes to Legendary items intended to bring them more in line with each other. Items that give a raw throughput increase (without significant situational restrictions or drawbacks) are having their overall power reduced, and we’re taking another pass at several of the more niche items to make sure that, when they’re usable, they feel powerful.<br />
<br />
Essentially, we feel that if a Legendary is only usable in certain situations, it should feel extremely valuable in those situations. Conversely, if a Legendary is nearly always going to increase your overall performance, that increase should be relatively smaller. Up until this point, we’ve made the mistake of allowing several items to be both extremely impactful AND always useful, which has made other Legendaries feel “bad” by comparison. It’s also caused some specs to feel as though they need a particular Legendary in order to compete. Those are the issues we’d like to solve.<br />
<br />
We’re actively working on these changes right now and expect to have them ready for the next PTR build. We’ll be doing additional class tuning where necessary as a followup, once these changes are in place.<br />
<br />
Instead we are faced with the daunting possibility that we may simply never get a useful legendary. That is not fun, its repeatedly disappointing.<br />
We agree. The problem is that some Legendaries don't feel useful. That's the issue we're looking to solve here.<br />
<br />
I really hope you guys learn from the system and the next iteration of legendaries is purely defensive/utility and no outright dps legendary affixes. They would be much more fair/balanced if they were that way.<br />
There's definitely a lot we've learned here. Ion even said pretty much exactly this in the last Q&amp;A - if we did it all over again, we'd probably only make &quot;Utility&quot; Legendaries.<br />
<br />
With some, as the instructors fourth lesson for Unholy DKs, it is MANDATORY. This legendary is -required- for us to perform even remotely on par with other DPS classes.<br />
Right. As I said, that's another problem we're trying to fix. If a spec is only competitive with a specific Legendary, then we need to bring up their numbers. To do that, we need to also nerf that Legendary.<br />
<br />
Just use a legendary token system. Problem solved.<br />
Disagree. &quot;Just let me pick the best Legendary&quot; doesn't solve this particular problem; there shouldn't be one or two Legendaries that are far and away the best one in all situations. With the way these items are in 7.1, if we add such a system, everyone will just pick the best 2 for their spec and the rest will still suck. We'd rather that none of them sucked.<br />
<br />
And just to be clear: something like what you (and others) are describing here is not off the table. Ion even mentioned at BlizzCon that we may end up doing something along those lines in a later patch. It just doesn't solve this problem.<br />
<br />
Another problem not mentioned here is being spec-locked because of legendaries. I have X on my spec, so can't freely switch without feeling behind. AP already contributes to this problem but at least can be caught up -- legendaries, with soft caps and what not, just make it impossible to switch.<br />
Yeah, we definitely share your concern here. We don't have a solution yet (and aren't likely to for 7.1.5), but it's something we're talking about.<br />

Upcoming Unholy Death Knight Changes<br />
Quick note on a small upcoming change: in the next PTR build, Apocalypse will burst up to 6 Festering Wounds (instead of 8). However, the damage of the summoned ghouls will be increased by 33% (which will not be obvious from data), keeping the total the same. This is also a large buff to the damage of Army of the Dead. Finally, in a separate change, the damage of the summoned Gargoyle and Val'kyr will be increased.<br />
<br />
However, will apocalypse continue to burst 4 wounds in pvp?<br />
Yes. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/788783-ion-dk-uh-feedback/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20752535075?page=11#202))<br />

<br />
You can have dps legendaries. But let us target them. Not with something cheap like a token system. This is a fucking RPG, not legendary Walmart. Replace legendary drops with a titan-related reagent. Salvage professions by letting us craft certain legendaries with that reagent. For others require something different; some of them obviously come from our class hall champions or are related to specific locations in WoW; let me trade Liadrin some of that applied plebotinum for her ring. Others could even come with small questlines; nothing more than what some hidden artifact appearances got with maybe a mob to kill at the end.<br />
<br />
Also since they farmed D3 for ideas they should have taken a look at what legendaries do in D3 at their best. They prop up unconventional builds. Make a legendary that creates new synergies among talents that don't work well together or that make a weaker spell important.</div></div><hr />

Disagree. &quot;Just let me pick the best Legendary&quot; doesn't solve this particular problem<br />
<br />
How about this? Actually do use token system for legendaries with a slight tweak. When I'm able to get two legendaries, make me get at least one legendary with utility/defense one. Let's say I'm a Destruction Warlock. I completed a Mythic+ dungeon, I got lucky and got a token for legendary. I, of course, want to get one that will boost my damage. However, the next time I get a token, the game will actually tell me that I can't get a legendary for another DPS increasing one, instead it will make me choose, let's say, Prydaz or Pillars of The Dark Portal or Sephuz, even. I'll gladly buy my utility/defense legendary and won't even complain about my RNG. Right now, me waiting for my DPS legendary is just miserable to watch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Provided that every class has at least 2-3 legendaries that increases their DPS, this is never going to happen. What are they going to do, remove all DPS legendaries? Prepare to see the community rage to them, with good reason.<br />

Basicaly each relic has a droptable of 5 items, in 3 tiers, 3 bronze items (most likely to drop) 2 silver (50-50) and rare (unlikely to drop). You can &quot;refine&quot; these relics with resources to increase the rare chance drop and descrease bronze and silver (i belive rare can be refined up to 33% chance to drop).<br />
<br />
So how about tying legendaries to .... M+ keystones? Like say you have a NL Keystone , it has a &quot;high&quot; chance to drop prydaz, pillars and... socrolash's dark strike, a medium chance to drop Wilfred's Signet or Odr's Shawl and a low chance to drop feratory (replace utility / ok / bis legendaries in your mind as you see fit). And this key can be pumped with some kind of resources (Garrison resources, special little &quot;shards&quot; your champions bring back from missions, &quot;souls&quot; gathered from 5 man WQ's , wtv) and now at the end of that run, you have an &quot;ok&quot; chance to get feratory, you still have a higher chance to get say prydaz, but lower than an &quot;unrefined&quot; key, or you could just get nothing...</div></div><hr />

<br />
That works for Diablo because legendaries are easy to acquire. As you know everyone is going to gravitate to whichever spec is stronger for the intended meta role in each class. Balancing is more or less easy since the content difficulty is infinitely scalable automatically. For wow this would be extremely hard to balance, not to say impossible. Proper raid tuning would be impossible as legendaries would in practice multiply the number of available specs from 36 to whichever stupidly high number of &quot;sub specs&quot; would be made viable by such game changing legendaries.<br />
<br />
The way I see it blizzard has three choices and all seem easy to implement in a PTR cycle:<br />
1) Increase the drop rate of legendaries or at least remove the diminishing returns necessary to acquire legendaries. Each legendary would take as much effort as the second legendary now takes to acquire. In roughly 6 months everyone could have all the legendaries for their class.<br />
<br />
2) Replace future legendary drops with a legendary token to purchase any legendary at a vendor<br />
<br />
3) (hardest and least plausibly) Remove all legendary from players, give each character a token for each removed legendary and implement 2).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only thing Blizz can do besides just scrapping legiondaries altogether is to in some way let players &quot;pursue&quot; a particular legendary, gathering tokens and buying them (although easiest to do and make suitable for all content) is a bit meh lorewise, maybe a questline (Involving collect-quests, mission items, whatever) with at the end as reward a legendary of the player's choice would be decent?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">uaemaster</div><div class="date">2016-12-14, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I read the comments here and it seems there are two polar sides to the issue of legendaries. On one end, people like the idea of farming for a rewarding legendary and the DPS increase reflects the effort placed in obtaining it. On the other end, people don't like the idea that the piece is tied heavily to luck, and depending on your luck, your dps can be comparable to others.<br />
<br />
So I have come up with a solution that will satisfy all sides, including blizzards idea behind the legendary being a bonus of sorts.<br />
<br />
Take the example of my main Retri paladin. Right now, I need to farm the back and ring to be able to compete, as they are pure dps increases. This means any other legendary will be a passive stat increase until I get those two. Why not bring in an element of set bonuses where people can use 4 items of a 5 piece set to be able to gain the benefits while still maintaining a control factor, where they choose to opt out of the 5th item in order to choose an off-set item that might have better secondary stats. <br />
<br />
How can this be used with the current legendary system? (Back to my retri example) take the affixes that are tied to the back and ring, create one affix as a one piece set bonus, and the other affix as a two piece set bonus. Meaning any of the current legendaries combined will give me those benefits. The back and ring can be converted into other utility benefits, and people will focus on min-maxing with the correct secondry stats, and the added benefit of some sort of utility (like the movement speed with the boots.)<br />
<br />
Blizz can take it one step further and have the legendary 1 and 2 piece bonuses convert with spec (similar to class trinkets in HFC.)<br />
<br />
I wanted to post this on the official forums but it wont allow an EU account to post it in the US forums.(Feel free to post it yourselves if you can)</div></div><hr />

Funny, sounds exactly like something I suggested even though others on this site insisted that legendaries have always been about damage.<br />

I really hope Blizzard learned something from this one, never ever give players a choice between damage and something else, they will always choose damage, and throw a tantrum if they can't do so.</div></div><hr />

From a Retperspective:<br />
Damage (Cape, Liandrins, changed Belt) ;Utility (Prydaz, Plateboots, Bracers) ;conditional Damage (Sephuz, Helm)<br />
-You can only wear one of each Tier.<br />
-Researching &quot;Legends of the Fallen&quot;(?) instead of allowing to wear 2 Legendaries, gives you a Token. Research is repeatable.<br />
-The Token turns 1 Legendary of your choice to goo. Said goo can be turned into a random Legendary of a certain group of your choice, no duplicates.<br />
<br />
This still keeps randomness while also allowing to aim for a certain Legendary if you have enough Tokens. The rare cases of duplicates gets solved. It would allow to change Specs easier and alleviate the Problem of wanting Loot for one Spec but a Legendary for another. Those who have 2 BiS Legendaries and more, get compensated by being allowed to wear 3 overall while gaining utility.<br />
Those who only have one Legendary are fucked anyways but they may gain some Damage. The only ones left out in the cold are people who have only 2 BiS Legendaries since they would not be ably to fully make up for the damageloss. With that being said, if Blizz would implement this it would take time to the Patch release, so another Month or so.</div></div><hr />

Disagree. &quot;Just let me pick the best Legendary&quot; doesn't solve this particular problem; there shouldn't be one or two Legendaries that are far and away the best one in all situations. With the way these items are in 7.1, if we add such a system, everyone will just pick the best 2 for their spec and the rest will still suck. We'd rather that none of them sucked.<br />
<br />
And just to be clear: something like what you (and others) are describing here is not off the table. Ion even mentioned at BlizzCon that we may end up doing something along those lines in a later patch. It just doesn't solve this problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
if we add such a system, everyone will just pick the best 2 for their spec and the rest will still suck<br />
<br />
So intead we'll just create a system where people quit the game because the system you do have sucks worse. Brilliant.<br />
<br />
Legendary system was garbage... artifact system was garbage. Wasted SOOO much resources on these two things... then returned to your old WoD tricks of wasting players time instead of engaging them with quality content.<br />

There's no fucking way they think this expansion is good. There are so many atrociously flawed and frustrating game mechanics that are SO poorly designed; yet they force themselves to hype it up to people who know they're talking out their ass.<br />
<br />
When titanforging and legendaries were announced, I was part of the many who outcried that this was a horrendous system. To this day, it's the worst part of Legion with Mythic Keystones a close second on the cancer scale. What, you work an actual job and can't play all day? Enjoy losing your raid spot to someone who can run carry groups all day and farm free 880+ pieces for doing fucking 20 minute 5 mans. Awful design; simply ridiculous. The carrot on a stick mentality implies that the carrot has to be eventually reachable. It used to be that you would get gear by actually being decent at the game and getting into mythic raids. These days, mythic raid gear is barely even playable. All the best trinkets except one or two are 5 man drops. And once you get there, you get into the flaws that 5 mans have always had. It eventually gets overgeared and becomes an AoE-fest and once you get there, some classes are absurdly ahead of others.<br />
<br />
In short, Legion has been an okay expansion for normal people, an amazing expansion for casuals but the absolute worst one yet for people like me in the 4/7-5/7 Mythic EN range who work real jobs and can't play all the god damned time.<br />
<br />
It's frustrating. I'm not usually one to complain much but I just can't stand hearing everyone talk about this expansion as some sort of godsend.<br />
<br />
In short : <br />
- Arena is at its worst ever, you can't even buy your purely cosmetic Elite gear! (Because of RNG)<br />
- BGs are at their worst ever, you can't even farm them for purely-cosmetic previous-season gear. (Because of RNG)<br />
- Gearing is at an unprecedented (in any game I've ever played) low, I can't even grasp the logic here. (Because of RNG, because of 5 man gear being FAR better than raid gear, because of Mythic keystones in general, because of class imbalances in 5 mans, because of legendaries... so basically RNG again, titanforging can suck a dick)<br />
- Artifact power is a mess.<br />
- The most alt-unfriendly expansion of any game ever.<br />
<br />
All in all, I still have fun in raids. I perform consistently at 85-99% for my ilvl (which is absurdly low due to being unlucky, I'm 870 in a raid group that's almost 100% 880+) but I do not doubt that I will be permanently sat in the near future until I can get better gear. How do you compete with guildies who get 885 socketed BiS trinkets from a world boss? :)))) Fantastic design.</div></div><hr />

Create a quest, possibly repeatable. Make it a significant effort but not a retarded token grind. At the culmination of the quest you can trade a legendary you have for a chance at a totally different one from your current spec's pool. <br />
<br />
Or just implement the goddamned token system. Whatever. I got Sephuz Secret on my Affliction Warlock so. I mean. Whatever, it's a POS that almost literally any other effect would be slightly better. I'd take a tanking DEFENSE or utility leg over that hunk of stinky crap.</div></div><hr />

It will most likely still make some more attractive than others, but not in the same way.<br />
<br />
Just to give you an example, I recently had to replace Aggramar's stride (http://www.wowdb.com/items/132443-aggramars-stride) for a much better legendary DPS wise, which to me was sad as the utility one was a whole lot more fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Provided that every class has at least 2-3 legendaries that increases their DPS, this is never going to happen. What are they going to do, remove all DPS legendaries? Prepare to see the community rage to them, with good reason.<br />
<br />
Blizzard HAS to swallow, if they don't want even more shit coming their way. Just admit the system is a failure.<br />
<br />
I'll take a utility legendary on my bear tank over the &quot;deal 30% extra physical damage to targets over 90% hp&quot; one I got any day. What the hell use is that trashy dps belt to a tank anyway? Why am I getting a dps legendary on a tank spec? Effectively spent months until I got my first legendary and then for it to end up as useless as that? Thanks, Blizzard.<br />

Wholeheartedly agree. The amount of RNG involved in Legion is absolutely ridiculous and Blizzard has pretty much screwed the pooch but good with this xpack to the point where I, someone who has been raiding since the beginning of WoW am throwing my hat in and saying... hey guys, this thing isn't rewarding at all anymore and I'm just growing more and more frustrated with the lack of luck each passing day.<br />
<br />
The game used to be fun but I simply can't afford to spend the amount of time required to grind up gear in mythic+ so I'm stuck with not raiding anymore because I can't be competitive. And with raiding gone, the rest of the game simply holds very little allure to me. I guess it's off to search for a game that's actually playable by an adult.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think this is the crux of the issue. The legendaries on paper are fine, but the devs are refusing to see that guilds and players will ALWAYS demand the BiS. Always. They probably expect guilds to overlook your lack of 885 gear, but anyone who plays knows that's not how it works. Everyone knows that competitive guilds will require legendaries, and make raid composition decisions based on that. <br />
<br />
The whole system is incredibly broken. As sold by Blizzard, legendaries are fun extras you may or may not get over the course of the expansion, but made them so valuable, they're now being required (How they didnt see that coming is beyond me), and now players are making spreadsheets to farm them the most efficiently and in the quickest amout of time. The system is diametrically opposed to how how players and guilds act, and there is no fix, other than making them cosmetic, or removing them - or putting them in a grind/time reward system, like tokens. <br />
<br />
They must have spent an inordinant amount of time developing this system, because they won't budge off of it at all - and that pig headedness is going to cause more drama. <br />
<br />
They don't know their players, or they purposely ignore them. It's the only explaination. They KNOW players need carrots. They KNOW players will always demand the best iLvl, no matter what the actual output is. They KNOW players will try to game even RNG to get guaranteed results. They KNOW players will hear &quot;You might&quot; as &quot;I'm guaranteed&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard should know how their players approach their game - a game that has practically trained them to act the way they do. Extra power has all kinds of ways to be given to the player, without a flat stat-on-gear approach. Rotations in conjunction with gear is one example, but they've sanded the rotations down to bare metal this time around. <br />
<br />
The problem is on both sides. The devs don't design to how players actually act, and the players will always look to game the system to their own benefit every time. They've nurtured and trainied a player-base to act in ways that have made changes almost impossible.<br />
<br />

Funny, sounds exactly like something I suggested even though others on this site insisted that legendaries have always been about damage.<br />

I really hope Blizzard learned something from this one, never ever give players a choice between damage and something else, they will always choose damage, and throw a tantrum if they can't do so.<br />

I feel making them all utility is boring as hell too. I'd almost prefer them ALL giving different types of throughput increases. Then again...I'm always a fan of buffing low outliers up, NOT nerfing everything that's good to bring everything down to the lowest common denominator.</div></div><hr />

No, it makes them annoying.<br />

I think this is the crux of the issue. The legendaries on paper are fine, but the devs are refusing to see that guilds and players will ALWAYS demand the BiS. Always. They probably expect guilds to overlook your lack of 885 gear, but anyone who plays knows that's not how it works. Everyone knows that competitive guilds will require legendaries, and make raid composition decisions based on that. <br />
<br />
If a guild is benching you because of legendaries - it's not because of legendaries. It's because they don't like you. Probably because you whine about legendaries too much.</div></div><hr />

There will always be the two bis legendaries no matter what. They can change the effects on the items or whatever, but the two strongest legendaries will be focused and the QQ'ing will never stop. Even if they change all legendaries to utility ones, they will still have stats on it, so we are still going to use the legs with the strongest dps output. No one cares about utility effects. Will of Valeera is an good example, completely useless for raid enviroment - bad effect and the haste makes this pants worse than 890 with correct stats.</div></div><hr />

I agree with all of your post, except I don't think it's amazing for casuals at all. Most casuals that I know (including myself in that number) like to: level and play alts and do professions. Both of which are locked behind dungeons, time gates, and RNG. When I look at how much I have yet to do in order to simply level my alts' professions I just close the game. Forget it.</div></div><hr />

Wow, I can't imagine having so little in my life to do I have to go onto third-party forums for a game I don't play to complain about it. Wow, that is a level of dedication to assholery that I can not begin to process.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stop spreading this myth. It only matters if you're in the top 2% - Fucking things up for everyone else to cater to that 2% or just generally horribly guilds that set moronic requirements because they don't understand the game is awful design. Nobody is ever going to get sat / rejected from a Heroic or even a casual mythic guild because they didn't win the RNG lottery. The ONLY time this is a problem is if you're pushing for hardcore Mythic progression which almost nobody, comparatively, is doing.</div></div><hr />

If you were in a progression raid guild then you would be able to see that the utility legendaries are good for progression, despite not being DPS increases. If you arne't in a progress raid guild then the legendaries aren't doing much for you anyway.<br />
<br />
DPS having the sole objective of doing bigger numbers make the DPS bad, yes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh really, I joined a progression raiding guild with one utility legendary, I got my second legendary and that was also a utility legendary, I've yet to be benched. Strange.<br />
<br />
what guild?<br />

For every person who believes this there are 10 guilds that do it.</div></div><hr />

Of course not... I wouldn't want to spoil your experience by handing everything to you on a plate.<br />
