Legion - Elerethe Renferal<br />
Elerethe Renferal (http://wow.gamepedia.com/Elerethe_Renferal) is one of the bosses in the Emerald Nightmare raid. <br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;506&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/K_vsV1zU5M4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
Elerethe, once a mighty druid and adept shapeshifter, died believing she was betrayed by those she trusted. Her soul now resides in the nightmare, damning her to an existence of fear, confusion, and hatred.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overview - As the fight progresses, Elerethe swaps between two nightmare forms that determine what abilities she uses. During Spider form, Elerethe uses &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/210242-web-of-pain&quot;&gt;Web of Pain&lt;/a&gt; on the tanks and on a random pair of dps. Damage received by your partner is reflected back to you. During Roc form, Elerethe uses &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/210948-dark-storm&quot;&gt;Dark Storm&lt;/a&gt; that creates a safe space on another platform then flies to it. Until the raid reaches that safe space, they take damage. If Elerethe ever walks onto the web, she gains &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/222063-web-walker&quot;&gt;Web Walker&lt;/a&gt; and will proceed to destroy anyone in her path. In Mythic difficulty, Elerethe activates an additional ability depending on what platform she is currently fighting on.<br />
<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/dps.png&quot; title=&quot;Dps&quot; /&gt; Damage Dealers - During Spider form, stand apart from the raid during &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/215443-necrotic-venom&quot;&gt;Necrotic Venom&lt;/a&gt; to place venomous pools.<br />
During Roc form, place &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/210850-twisting-shadows&quot;&gt;Twisting Shadows&lt;/a&gt; away from the raid.<br />
Kill Venomous Spiderlings.<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/healer.png&quot; title=&quot;Healer&quot; /&gt; Healers - During Spider form, heal players connected by &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/210242-web-of-pain&quot;&gt;Web of Pain&lt;/a&gt; .<br />
During Roc form, &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/210948-dark-storm&quot;&gt;Dark Storm&lt;/a&gt; pulses damage to the raid until they reach the eye of the storm.<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/tank.png&quot; title=&quot;Tank&quot; /&gt; Tanks - During Spider form, remain within 20 yards of your partner during &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/210242-web-of-pain&quot;&gt;Web of Pain&lt;/a&gt;.<br />
During Roc form, taunt the boss off of the tank that was just hit by &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/215582-raking-talons&quot;&gt;Raking Talons&lt;/a&gt;.<br />
Swap off of the adds when gaining too many stacks of &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/210229-dripping-fangs&quot;&gt;Dripping Fangs&lt;/a&gt;.<br />

Worgen Running Wild<br />
It's in the game, it's just missing from the spellbook. If you make a level 55 DK you can even see it on your action bar.<br />
<br />
We did a lot of spellbook tweaks this expansion and this was probably just hidden by accident. Let us know if you notice any other racials missing.

So, in #Legion, if a party of 4 and a party of 3 all tag a normal outdoor mob, do all 7 people get credit &amp; loot for the kill?<br />

Demons have green blood in the lore, and so a fel corrupted orc having green blood isn't much of a stretch. I'd prefer that over &quot;The Hobbit&quot; levels of bloodless violence, honestly.</div></div><hr />
