Lol, get ready for everyone to roll an Assassination Rogue for PvP, as if they weren't already on their way to being Flavour of the Season. 30 yard auto-attacks and poison procs are pretty much the main factors in Assassination DPS and now they can do it from range. Can't wait.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really. The overall changes are a buff for the intended but seldom used arcane playstyle (stack reseting) and a serious nerf for the currently most common, unintended and strongest playstyle (scorch-weaving). It will probably make scorch-weaving impossible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
GC recently tweeted they were going to make arcane blast stack less and be worth more each stack so that ramp up wasn't so punishing, especially because of the scorch fix. Don't take it too far out of context, a max stack AB should be same as it was before but arcane shouldn't feel as nerfed in 5.2 as before losing ability to keep AB stacks with scorch weaving. mage damage for arcane will probably still be slightly down in 5.2 vs 5.1 even with this change since arcane mages will stlll be clearing more often.</div></div><hr />

What? What kind of thought process led you to think that? Love is in the Air starts in around two weeks. All that it means is that the patch is releasing sometime after that event has transpired and before the Midsummer one begins, not that it has to release close to Midsummer.<br />
<br />

I'd think it means that it'll be sometime between the events, which doesn't in anyway mean that it'll be closer to June. Not sure how you drew that conclusion tbh.</div></div><hr />

Hope the ICD on that 30% haste is like 60-70 sec, else I would really consider to use the int one. Can we use 2 META gems or is this the one to use.

If you have Atlasloot you'll see the gear is already updated. Love is in the Air necks are ilevel 480/Level 90.<br />
<br />
Past tier may have been cool, but I was talking more along the lines of the lacking in daggers and also the coming transmog changes not including daggers. (No dagger to axe but sword to axe). <br />
<br />
Animations =/= to spell effects. So your insinuation of me wanting something &quot;flashy&quot; is overly assumptive, lackluster and completely unrelated to my point that certain spells share/lack an animation. Eviscerate and Feint anyone? Also, this has been stated by GC and something they are looking at for class appeal considering the class was underplayed even when OP at the end of Cata. <br />
<br />
As for spec differentiation, Assasination and Combat are brutally similar and a Rogue's signature resource (combo points) was introduced to several new classes arguably implemented better. (No redirect needed for Monks and Paladins)<br />
<br />
I am beginning to believe you haven't played any OTHER class.</div></div><hr />

I believe the former will be the case, which wouldn't surprise me; I'd wondered why it was that my LW alt didn't have a daily CD like the other professions. Better stock up now on Magnificent Hides if you don't already have some!<br />

What exactly are those Blacksmithing items for?<br />
Judging by the tooltips, it looks to be a &quot;catching up&quot; path for blacksmithing (like what we have now for cooking).</div></div><hr />

<br />
For skilling up Blacksmithing. I presume they are vendor trash.</div></div><hr />

This is a flying mount. Account wide. 1.5 sec cast.<br />
<br />
Anyone else suspect this is the lore they're going to use to explain/justify the passenger being dismounted between zones?<br />
<br />
I took that to mean the claws aren't going to crush the life out of your ally by picking him/her up.<br />
<br />
I do wish they'd fix that bug though. I've lost so much time to it and even died a few times. In general, I think CRZ is a good thing, but the bugs are really, really bad and should have been worked out before they pushed it live.</div></div><hr />

ARE THEY KIDDING ME WITH FROST MAGES!?<br />
<br />
If I'm not mistaken, they wanted to remove the blanket CC on counterspell, and originally added deep freeze breaking on damage (which didn't even make it to the US as Euro mages QQ'd too fast for it to be announced here), and were going to lower cold snap to 15%, while &quot;buffing&quot; to compensate by increasing FoF proc rates and increasing the dmg on frostbolt by 25% (and removing the stacking buff, thus being equivalent damage at all times instead of needing 3 stacks of the debuff).<br />
<br />
So what happens? Mages QQ to kingdom come, blizz reverts the change to imp CS, to deep freeze, and now to cold snap, but is leaving in the &quot;compensatory buffs&quot; to FoF proc and frostbolt damage. So in the end, they BUFFED FROST MAGES. Does anybody else see a problem here?</div></div><hr />

Nice tunnelvision there laddie, the silence was given back to Warlocks as well(but you convineintly don't cry about that) plus Hunters and Priests never lost theirs to begin with.<br />
<br />
I don't know where you got the cold snap part, they buffed the FoF rate of frostbolt because the Freeze from the water elemental no longer grants FoF charges on immune targets, meaning even with the buff to FB there are less charges (so even with your reasoning it would not compensate).</div></div><hr />

that was stamina before, not agility,<br />
but anyway crit is fucking worst, for some classes it's really useless, like for frost dk who don't need this crit at all coz of KM procs, wtf they thinking,</div></div><hr />

I think theturn was comparing these gems against the ones that are currently used in-game, ie the +216 agi and 3% crit damage one.</div></div><hr />
