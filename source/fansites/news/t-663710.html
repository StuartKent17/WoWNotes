Below is a small recap of what was said during the Cataclysm Preview panel, I'm still working on organizing the information to make it more readable. Pictures should be available shortly as well. <br />
General<br />
Level cap will be 85 because developers wanted to focus on the right things: redoing Azeroth and providing more end-game content. <br />
A new guild advancement system will let you earn guild perks and level a guild through 20 levels with points to spend in a talent tree. You will access abilities such as cheaper repairs, less durability loss on wipes, or mass resurection. <br />
Phasing can now add and remove terrain based on your progress. Coasts will be progressively more flooded depending on how far you are in a storyline for example.<br />
<br />
Path of the Titans<br />
Talent trees won't be extended, you will just get 5 more talent points.<br />
The Path of the Titans will let players follow a path (not restricted to classes), this is a new talent system with new skills and passive abilities.<br />
A mastery system is being added as well, a lot of talents will be reworked to be more fun. The point is to get rid of a lot of the talent skills and not make you spend all your points in a talent tree just because it gives you more damage or higher crit chance. <br />
<br />
Archeology<br />
Archeology is a new secondary profession, not many details about this one but we'll probably hear more about it in future panels.<br />
<br />
Deathwing<br />
Deathwing, the leader of the Black Dragonflight will be the main vilain of the expansion. <br />
Deathwing heard the whispers of the Old Gods after the arrival of the Burning Legion, he eventually grew very powerful and also became very very crazy. <br />
His plan was to catch the Alliance and Horde unaware with something so massive that it would bring up the Elemental Planes.<br />
The Elemental Planes were created by titans to contain the elementals, they weren't happy with this decision and some of them like Ragnaros got really angry. <br />
<br />
New races - Worgens<br />
Other races were discussed for the alliance, but the developers really felt that the alliance needed a monstrous race and horde needed something fun and tiny. <br />
Genn Greymane closed the Greymane Wall to block the Scourge's plague. Gilneas got nervous as the Scourge progressed to the south.<br />
Arugal was a patriot, he called the Worgens to battle for Gilneas but eventually was surprised by how dangerous what he called down was. <br />
Worgens are from somewhere else ... or even someWHEN else. They have a wolverine temperament and spent a lot of time trying to contain the beast within. <br />
Racial - Visciousness - +1% damage. <br />
Racial - Dark Flight - +70% run speed for 10 seconds. <br />
Racial - Abberation - Duration of Curses and Diseases reduced by 15% <br />
Racial - Flayer - Skinning skill increased by 15. <br />
<br />
New Races - Goblins<br />
Goblins are a technological race from Kezan, their society is broken up into trade cartels run by trade princes. They are new factions and not the ones you can already see in game.<br />
The Cataclysm hit Kezan really hard and it's possibly destroyed. The goblins are now refugees on the Lost Isles. <br />
As a goblin you start as a neutral cartel and eventually join the horde as you progress through the questlines.<br />
Racial - Best Deals Anywhere - Always receive the best discount regardless of faction.<br />
Racial - Pack Hobgoblin - Calls your personal servant allowing you bank access for 1 minute. 30 mins cooldown.<br />
Racial - Better Living Through Chemistry - Alchemy skill increased by 15.<br />
Racial - Rocket Barrage - Launches your belt rockets an an enemy, dealing fire damage. 2 min cooldown.<br />
Racial - Rocket Jump - Activates your rocket belt to jump forward. 2 min cooldown. <br />
Racial - Time is Money - 1% increased attack and casting speed. <br />
<br />
Old World<br />
We all left a little part of ourselves in Northrend and the old world will be much darker than it was to make heroism and brotherhood more meaningful like Warcraft should be. <br />
Every zones will be revamped with new quests, items, and art. The old world will be a brand new experience and you won't have to deal with the annoying agility/spirit quest rewards anymore. <br />
Azeroth is now flyable. Pretty much all the zones will be changed to some extent, some of them like Elwynn Forest won't change too much but others like The Barrens will be sundered in two by Deathwing. <br />
The Wailing Caverns are now a lush and verdant Area. <br />
Desolace now has a lot more waters and a lot of plants can be seen in the screenshots. <br />
The Horde finally conquered Southshore. <br />
Auberdine was destroyed and the night elves have set up a new camp north of it. Garrosh wants to expand the horde and has built a fortified camp at the south of the zone.<br />
Stonetalon has been cleaned by the Goblins, Azshara will be the new Goblin zone, and are using quarries in the mountains of Azshara to build their town.<br />
Apparently Orgrimmar will be rebuilt and reinforced with steel, it now looks a lot like Garrosh strongholds...<br />
Undercity has been redesigned to be flyable, it now looks much more impressive from the outside. <br />
<br />
New Zones<br />
7 new zones will be added : Twilight Highlands, Mount Hyjal, Deepholm, Uldum, Gilneas, The Lost Isles, Sunken City of Vash'jir. <br />
<br />
Starting Areas<br />
The Worgens and Goblins starting zone level goes from 1 to 15. <br />
<br />
Vasj'ir<br />
Sunken City of Vashj'ir will be an underwater zone and was the home city of Lady Vashj before the original sundering, this is a gateway to the Abyssal Maw. Going through the Abyssal Maw will take you to the Elemental Plane of Water, even if the zone will be underwater you will be walking on the sea floor here, new underwater mounts will be available and should have the same speed as normal flying mounts. <br />
<br />
Deepholm<br />
Deepholm will be the new hub of the expansion, you will have portals here to let you teleport to Hyjal, Uldum, etc ... The Twilight's Hammer now serves Deathwing and have brought him back to full health in the Temple of Earth at the center of the map. <br />
Deepholm isn't really connected to Azeroth, the connection is where Deathwing emerged from the ground. <br />
<br />
Uldum<br />
Uldum will have at least two dungeons and is heavily inspired from Egypt. The sea at the west of Tanaris was just an illusion created by the Titan and Uldum is actually a brand new zone. It is rumored to hold a super weapon. Uldum is also the home of the Tolvir, a race of stone-like cats created by the titans. <br />
<br />
Plane of Fire<br />
Ragnaros used the cataclysm to come back from the Plane of Fire where we sent him and is now sieging the World Tree in Mount Hyjal to burn it down. Malfurion is back from the Emerald Dream. The whole zone (Hyjal) will make extensive use of phasing.<br />
<br />
Twilight Highlands<br />
The Twilight Highlands will feature Grim Batol, Deathwing literally broke open Grim Batol as he emerged from the ground. This is the new Twilight's Hammer base in Azeroth and both Horde and Alliance will have a new port town with boats here. The Red Dragonflight is still here but has been pushed back to the west of the zone near the Wetlands. <br />
<br />
Dungeons &amp; Raids<br />
The Firelands will be a new raid dungeon, it will let you go to the Elemental Plane of fire and visit Sulfuron's Keep, Ragnaros will be here and he's really pissed.<br />
Uldum will feature two new dungeons, the Lost City of Tol'vir and the Halls of Origination (a titan city)<br />
Grim Batol will have a level-up dungeon and a raid instance.<br />
Skywall (Air Elemental Plane) will have a level-up dungeon and a raid instance.<br />
The Deadmines and Shadowfang Keep will be back in a brand new level 85 heroic version.<br />
Blackrock Caverns will be a new level-up dungeon located in Blackrock Spire. This is an entirely new dungeon, new art, new creatures, new everything.<br />
<br />
Player vs. Player<br />
Battle of Gilneas will be a new battleground where the objective is to control the city by controlling as many districts as possible. <br />
Tol'barad will be a new PvP zone and will also be the most important daily quest hub. Just like Wintergrasp a battle will happen every few hours and the winning side will get access to the Tol'barad Prison and extra daily quests, the really profitable ones. <br />
Rated battlegrounds will be added to the game and should get you the same rewards as Arenas.<br />
New arena maps will be added.<br />

<br />
Mastery talents feels like what Warhammer Online has. The more points you spend the better you become in what that tree does.<br />
<br />
I mean if they do it like they say, u can remove all the +dmg talents and you get that percentage by spending points in the tree. That frees up lots of talents to customize :)<br />

<br />
Back in Molten Core he was woken up at about 10%. We needed 40 level 60s to kill him.<br />
<br />
Now, he's at 100%. And he's pissed off.<br />
<br />
I think it's pretty fair to assume that'll take 10-25 level 85s :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
They basically are with Path of the Titans. It'll change the way you play your character, and differentiate you from every other priest with penance, or hunter with chimera shot.<br />
<br />
The ONLY thing that I'm a little disappointed in is the fact that there are no new classes. Not necessarily new classes, but new classes for your faction. Each expansion has introduced a new class to a faction - Pallys to Horde, Shaman to Alliance, DKs. The problem I see with this is that if you choose to level a goblin or worgen, you're inherently &quot;behind.&quot; If you decided to level a horde pally at the release of BC, you were behind, but everybody was waiting for you.<br />
<br />
If you decide to level a goblin rogue, people won't be waiting for you. They'll be saying, &quot;We have rogues, now get on your DK so we can raid sooner.&quot; This means that goblins and worgen will be a side project for most raiders, which is unfortunate.</div></div><hr />

Indeed. I haven't played WoW since March, tried a few weeks of WAR, but it never clicked. Will try Aion next month but I don't think I'll play more than a few weeks of that either. Leveling a new char just sucks most of the time. I like my maxlevel Chars in WoW - and this expension really looks sweet.</div></div><hr />

4 pages of comments, and only a couple disgruntled trolls. Seems like they pretty much hit the nail on the head with this one.<br />
<br />
The only people I can see that would dislike the idea of going back to Azeroth are newer players who didn't get to experience the awesomeness of vanilla in Azeroth, or get a chance to understand the importance of every Azerothian zone because they were in a rush to get to Outlands or Northrend.<br />

Maybe it is just me but this seems pretty new to me. It wouldn't seem new if we were entering molten core (like naxx at 80) to fight him but he is somewhere new and I assume the location will be brand new. Returning characters don't have to be a bad thing.</div></div><hr />

The game is evolving, so it's almost more than just an expansion, it's a new game. World of Warcraft 2 if you will.<br />

Actually, I am not sure how this expansion is competetive to Aion, for example. <br />
The expansion is exsiting for very specific groups of people - those who are long enough in game, nostalgic about old content but not yet leveled each and every possible class. <br />
For new players, who never seen &quot;old&quot; Azeroth, I am not sure how the expansion makes the game more competetive. The gameplay seem to be not much changed.... <br />
So, if this Aion game (haven't seen it yet) has something really exiting and new gameplay-wise - not sure Cataclism will be enough to fight it.... On the other hand, WoW is so well established I don't think it can be &quot;killed&quot; by anything but new Blizzard game - just because of how much time people invested there into learning and comunity building.</div></div><hr />

For someone like me who utterly hates Blizzards new (?) &quot;If it has not been used atleast four times, we've not used it enough&quot; policy this next expansion is going to be horrible.<br />
I smell slow but sure re-use of pretty much every armor and weapon vanilla WoW has to offer. Heroic Deadmines? Heroic Shadowfang keep? I know, lets just add few new items in the instances and make the old ones glow! they'll never know the difference. What, thats two instances already? We're pratically done with the new expansion instances already! Now lets go and make four different models for the quest rewards, that should be enough for leveling up. And dont be afraid to use the old NPC models..<br />
Lets just hope less leveling up means longer end-game content. In Northrend we got two whole new dragons in the beginning as end-game. Maybe Catalysm will now have three.<br />
<br />
Oh well, i'm probably assuming the worst again. I didin't like Northrend at first either but it turned out to be good fun. Or well atleast the questing part was..<br />
And even if everything else fails, Blizzard will still get their money back from the countless army of fanboys who will buy anything as long as it has &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; tagged on it.</div></div><hr />

It seems like it would do a lot to work on making the game better for new comers. The quests can be set up using current thoughts on how they should work rather than rewarding 4 pieces of spr/str gear. The quests can act to direct people to zones better especially considering the new experience curve. They want it to be as easy and obvious as possible to know where to go at all times especially to new people. It just so happens the old people can enjoy this remake as well. Right now a fair number of the old quests can feel clunky due to old mechanics that have since been phased out.</div></div><hr />

Tol'barad will be a new PvP zone and will also be the most important daily quest hub. Just like Wintergrasp a battle will happen every few hours and the winning side will get access to the Tol'barad Prison and extra daily quests, the really profitable ones.<br />

going from 60 to 80 :'( :'(<br />

ill be like running the marathon to get out of outland/northrend<br />
<br />
they should also decrease the leveling speed from 1-60 to how it used to be to enjoy all the areas, but from what ive seen in that map where they show the new lvl range for some areas (WPL 40-45 i believe) you can make an undead and get to like 55 only in north eastern kingdoms :P</div></div><hr />

What do you do to make more people play? Add new races that look kick ass. What do you do to get old players back and actually lvl the new races? Destroy all the lvling zones they wasted so much time in on their old toons and make cooler more deadly areas.... with lava!<br />
<br />
I for one after lvling 9 toons and getting the seeker and loremaster achievements have found it tiring to get any motivation to lvl any other classes cause i would be doing the exact same quests over and over again. This is perfect cause it tosses most of those quests out the window and even the zones they were in in some cases making lvling appealing again.<br />
<br />
But heres the big things im wondering. Worgen and Goblins have thier LV1-15 starter zones. What exactly happens when they make a DK? Also what is the Path of the Titans and Mastery things? Sounds like the merit system from FFXI. Hope we get more details on these.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Mastery is like WAR has... Basicly lets take Retribution for example. It has talnets that increase DMG. All these talents will be removed and will be incorportared with the amount of points you spend in the tree. <br />
<br />

&quot;Think twice before you read this post, we have a lot of spoilers here.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'd appreciate a warning before I have plot points ruined outright versus pure speculation.<br />
<br />
<br />
First of all, it's Blizzcon day. It doesn't take a lot to figure out there will be plot spoilers too.<br />

Actuallyt thats good... I feel attached so much to my paladin due to achievements i don't want to make alts cause i lose everything i worked for.<br />

Besides Achievements should note player knowledge/expirience. If you can get an achievment with one class then the achievement is there to show that you have the knowledge of that encounter!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">loftus</div><div class="date">2009-08-21, 11:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">at first i thought...<br />
<br />
1. only 5 levels? wtf.<br />
<br />
2. no new continent? boring.<br />
<br />
3. changing all the landscape? i hate change.<br />
<br />
then after thinking about it for a while, and seeing all the amazing info on MMO champion front page plus the offical wow catacalysm site.... <br />
<br />
im totally amazed.<br />
<br />
the titans thing, archaeology (lol sorry cant spell) new races, new class combos (there can finally be a gnome only guild!!!) and the million other things are brilliant.<br />
<br />
i finally realised the way blizz are doing it.<br />
<br />
It's as if they are saying 'ok guys, we've been doing this for a while and we wanted to test some things out, the first two were tests, now we know what we are doing and we want to bring you back to azeroth.. But this time, its going to be ******* epic.<br />
<br />
im now so excited about levelling again, i think it will finally feel like an online world rather than 'go here for this drop, go there for that.'<br />
<br />
i remember how magical it felt when i first joined, it feels like ive been on this long journey chasing down bad guys in outland and northrend, and now im finally going back home to azeroth to serve my country and fight again.<br />
<br />
the one and only thing i need to hear before i go totally crazy (lol at that batman gif a few posts ago.) is increased character slots per server. There are so many race/class combos i want to try, i really hope the limit gets raised from 10. If it changed to 50 characters total on any server, then i would officially need new pants. :)<br />
<br />
oh an P.S. anyone who hasnt, go to the offical website, view the official trailer. my first thought was '**** icecrown, just give me this xpac now!!!! :D)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only problem when i see things like this is that i want to play it now. The fact that i have to wait months is so sad lol, i have so little passion for playing wow currently simply because i dont want to spend loads of time levelling toons and then not be able to see the new levelling zones in the xpac.<br />
<br />
a few things people may be able to answer for me (as im not as clued up as some)<br />
<br />
1. I saw someones post earlier, will achievements be on account now? if so can someone quote it because i cant find it anywhere (sorry if im being stupidly blind)<br />
<br />
2. Will heirloom items etc. be removed? they said the way levelling is done will be totally revamped etc. + the new battleground changes, i was wondering if they would? i personally dont like heirloom items, i much prefer gearing my toon as they level, that to me is a big part of the game. I would much prefer some form of 'rest xp tokens' (increase your rest bar to stop your xp turning purple) or simply permanent rest.<br />
<br />
still so damn excited!!! :)</div></div><hr />

It was said by Rob Pardo during the SCII / Battle.net panel. He mentioned that all their games will be intergrated with Battle.net and this will allow them to Battlenet IDs.<br />
<br />
This in turn will allow players to speak corss realm/ cross faction in WoW or even Cross game i.e WoW with SC2. At the same time this will allow them to make Achievements account wide so people do not feel too attached to character due to achievements.</div></div><hr />

thank you so much for your post. i was hoping for something helpful, but that was brilliant.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
One of the best changes if this is true. In fact, Blizzard should extend this idea for World of Warcraft to the following:<br />
<br />
- All your collected gold.<br />
- All your collected tokens. (i.e. Badges, Champion Seals, PvP BG tokens)<br />
- All your collected non-combat pets.<br />
- All your collected mounts.<br />
<br />
Bound to your account, not a single character.<br />
<br />
It boggles my mind to why this stuff + achievements are still bound to a single character. <br />
<br />
It's certainly going to be technologically possible to implement (if what you say turns to be truthful) in the game and would ease the pain on either people who wish to reroll toons a lot or, like me, people who would like to reroll a toon after playing it for 4 years without losing all their in game accomplishments.<br />
<br />
Edit: And what better excuse then a totally revamped version of the game to start putting this into work ?</div></div><hr />

Re: Thrall &amp; Garrosh -<br />
There's been no actual statement that Thrall becomes the new Guardian yet, that I have found - doesn't mean it's not out there, just that I haven't found it. However, there's something going on between Thrall and Garrosh that sure looks like the end of Thrall being leader of the Horde.<br />
<br />

Lolwut? 15 months would put it next November. Perfect timing as WotLK was released then too. I'm assuming it will be latest next November but I wouldn't be surprised to see it out before then maybe even next summer. We're already on 3.2 and I will be 3.3 comes out November/December....so that would be a year before the next expansion. Unless they add a 3.4 and do something like the Isle then it will probably be sooner. I don't know much about designing games but I feel like having a landscape already and revamping it is easier than building one from scratch. (don't flame me for that) Although on the other hand they have to add a bunch of new quests. I also bet something like this has been in the works for awhile now. I wouldn't be surprised that they have been slowly coming up with ideas through the expansions for a major expansion like this.</div></div><hr />

I WANT the racial mount for goblins to be an ogre or ogre like creature, we have seen enough of them riding on ogres throughout the game.<br />
It will likely be some sort of rocket, given the high level of recycling content.<br />
<br />
The worgen?<br />
I have no idea.<br />
They seem to have a victorian theme, maybe old school bicycles, with the big wheel up front? and then an armored version for the epic...yeah that doesn't work. Maybe goth spikes for the epic mount.<br />

<br />
The ONLY thing that I'm a little disappointed in is the fact that there are no new classes. Not necessarily new classes, but new classes for your faction. Each expansion has introduced a new class to a faction - Pallys to Horde, Shaman to Alliance, DKs. The problem I see with this is that if you choose to level a goblin or worgen, you're inherently &quot;behind.&quot; If you decided to level a horde pally at the release of BC, you were behind, but everybody was waiting for you.<br />
<br />
If you decide to level a goblin rogue, people won't be waiting for you. They'll be saying, &quot;We have rogues, now get on your DK so we can raid sooner.&quot; This means that goblins and worgen will be a side project for most raiders, which is unfortunate.<br />
<br />
<br />
Take a look at some of those racials and uhm you will see some VERY favorable Race combo's with the Worgens and Goblins.</div></div><hr />

Also why don't the make both new races Worgen and Goblins NEUTRAL then you can decide which way you want them to go when you reach a certain level or reputation? Like what they are doing with the PATH of Titans. <br />
<br />
Plus starting at level 6 on a 1-15 zone doesn't make sense and it don't eave much to explore in the new starting zones. You will be done in less than an hour and move on and forever forget you were there. <br />
<br />
Plus rerolling a new character is not going to influence much players while the are lv there 80 characters. Now if they did with these new races what they did with death knights maybe people will try it out. I think its going to be a waste of time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That's what I'm thinking too. I rolled a BE when The Burning Crusade came out, but only because I wanted to try a Paladin. With no newly available class tied to Goblins, I'll be focused on my 4 current 80s (hey one's a DK!), getting them to 85 and geared up first.<br />
<br />
One thing to to consider is that ostensibly the leveling process will be 100% overhauled at least until 58, with all of the old world quests either replaced or revamped, and significantly changed geography. So at least that part won't be as soul-crushingly boring, though 1-85 is going to be MURDER, it's bad enough now for those not using the RAF...</div></div><hr />

<br />
i.e.<br />
<br />
If they specificaly cater to lazey people who dont want to level their chars and just want everything handed to them on a plate then yes it will be world of worgen / goblin craft.<br />
<br />
They are 2 new races, not hero class's.<br />

So unfortunate that this is happening so fast. The new raid came out extremely quick when vast majority of guilds are still not clearing 25 man Ulduar and then you give everyone the gear to be able to jump into the new raid. I'm actually understand and agree with helping new 80s be able to get into the newer raids so they dont get left behind but the way you guys are doing it is rediculous. You guys are just pushing out new content so this expansion is over as fast as possible so you can put a new one out and make more money. Unfortunately, this is killing the game for a lot of people. Personally I am done once the new expansion comes out and I know a lot of my friends who put unbelievable amounts of time into the game are too. It's understandable to be all about the money but atleast let us enjoy whats out for now before starting this whole expansion thing.</div></div><hr />

Actually yes. You see, the dock is two days on a horse from main points of interest in Stormwind. Your tower is a /spit away from your city.<br />
<br />
You get goblins defending your towers, so any alliance adventuring there is tricky unless they are lvl80. The dock, well it is now a much safer way to freely enter Stormwind and see how it is. Main gate was much trickier since you got into trade.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry but when I saw this post I almost died laughing my ass off. FAVORING THE HORDE YOU SAY?

I still have yet to see the faction changes in the panel announcements yet, I'm hopin' to switch to worgen druid b/c tauren aren't the best druid as-is, NE's have the worst racial for druids, and Alliance outnumbers Horde on my realm so I wanna be on the winning side, though it'll probably take away one of the 10 or so good healers on horde. I'm just glad that they're bringing back the game to the basics, it should most likely be very intuetive and bring back classic players along with new ones. Also, Who cares about Southshore, if the world is in ruins it was probably destroyed anyway. What I'm pissed about is that Garrosh kills Cairne. Now, sure Cairne's old, but I doubt unless he willingly submit to Garrosh because Garrosh is warchief, then he woulda ownt his ass in a fight. What also bugs me is how Thrall doesn't shortly come back to do something about it and Vol'Jin doesn't step in. Garrosh is a pussy with stupid ideas, so is Varian, and now the races should be tied as far as leader stupidity goes. Blizzard probably put them both in so they would either kill each other or kill themselves, choking in their own stupidity. Oh yeah, I think it was cool to put Thrall as the new Guardian of Tirisfal.</div></div><hr />

But no, we have idiots like Wrynn and Garrosh running things in-game and mindsets like yours running the players. ugh.<br />
<br />
Well, that's really not what World of Warcraft is all about.<br />
<br />
It's about struggle. For the Alliance, it's holding off against the savage Horde and protecting their homeland. For the Horde, it's holding a foothold in a world that doesn't understand a lot of their individuals...finding a place where they aren't going to be victimized in the end. A situation like that can cause only grief. It's inevitable. <br />
<br />
It's not about how to play it smart or how to work things diplomatically. In the very end, when two ideaologies are stressed against one another, their ideals become something to protect instead of something to uphold. It's the biggest start of conflicts in this world.<br />
<br />
Your human king has seen the worst of the Horde and has closed his eyes to the fact that they just want a place for themselves. The Warchief Thrall has wanted peace ever since he was given the title, but Hellscream has nothing but tyranny in his ideas.<br />
<br />
The close-minded fool versus the war-mongering tyrant. <br />
<br />
In the end, I know that we'll have independent factions working together to fight this problem. But the Alliance and Horde both see each other as a threat to the survival of their own ideals. That is how war is made: No clear thinking.<br />
<br />
As far as Legendaries for Feral Druids: Maybe they can make a legendary staff or polearm that works for both Hunters and Druids. But they really need to make it legendary. I don't want them to add it just for simple balance.</div></div><hr />

BLIZZARD giving a hunter a legendary melee weapon is equivalent to giving a warrior a legendary tanking gun, or legendary wands.. THEY ARE JUST STAT STICKS. hunters wont even truly &quot;use&quot; that weapon and its a legendary. fail. give them another bow or gun, i have no problem with that, but giving them a melee weapon..<br />

<br />
<br />
I think that the announcement was made just because of the leak. I agree that there is going to be some time until this expansion gets to the store shelves and to be honest Blizzard has a bad history on this matter.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, it mostly seems like a desperate attempt to get back people to the game as they see the approach of new MMO's.<br />
<br />
Though it actually seems interesting, but i won't fall for it again, already wasted 4 years on a game, time to try something new.<br />
<br />
<br />
I really don't think that they have a problem at the moment. If they know or predict that there is going to be a major release of a MMORPG from a rival company in the near future, then upgrading / expanding the game is a smart move and I can't really see any reason to critisize it. If this rivarly will force the companies to release better games then we, the consumers, will be the winners of this battle.<br />
<br />
This attempt doesn't seem so desperate at all. IMO Blizzard just made a step forward and this is always a risk, time will tell. <br />
<br />
And to finallize, I'd like to say something about the ruining of the lore. Proggresing the story doesn't ruin the lore, it just expands it. Also the Warcraft universe was made by Blizzard so they can ruined it if they like, but I am certain something like this wont happen. Blizzard is the proud &quot;mother&quot; of 3 major series: Warcraft, Diablo and Starcraft, and all 3 series have GREAT storylines (also excelent grafics and gameplay, but this is irrelevant now).<br />
So if they destroy Azeroth or sunk Northrend or even make Thrull the offspring of Varian and an orc slave it will all be for the best and most of the people complaining will play the game in the end.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I agree that they favor the horde a lot, but it makes sense that goblin got all that stuff. Lorewise, it seems that this expansion is the Horde's time to shine, so they get a ton of stuff while the Alliance are becoming the &quot;new horde&quot; by losing everything. So its natural that Goblins get all that stuff.<br />
<br />
Also, visually, goblins are boring comparing to worgen. How many people did you hear (when told about goblins/worgen) say &quot;Worgen are AWESOME but wtf who wants to play a goblin?&quot; and how many people did you hear say (when they announced race change) &quot;I'm switching my characters to worgen.&quot; <br />
<br />
They had to do something to balance out the number of people rolling worgen becasue they &quot;look cool.&quot; And to be honest I hope it works. I don't want everyone and their mom to go worgen, because I want to :) I don't care about racials.</div></div><hr />

you can join me if you would like and share comments reviews , news, pictures and whatever you want as well.<br />
also I like your collections of the your pictures very cool. I think this expansion is because many people have quit playing and dont play much that is why they made this expansion to attract ppl again thats why they have not put much effort to it. they are seeking peoples attention ::) agree???<br />
