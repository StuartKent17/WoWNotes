<br />
Update 01:15 AM CEST - As far as it looks, this is a minor build deployed to fix all the bugs introduced by the latest one. Right now the biggest change is a new loading screen for the DK Starting Zone, none of the class spells or talents were changed. <br />

WotLK Beta Build 8719 Tonight<br />
A new build is being deployed on WotLK Beta servers. As usual, stay tuned for all the changes ! <br />
The beta realms will be going down at 10:00 PM CEST to apply an update. We anticipate approximately six hours of downtime. <br />
<br />
Your patience and understanding are appreciated.<br />
<br />
This also includes a client patch or is this only a server patch?<br />
Client; 8719 I believe. Should be fun to see what it brings... but a shame I'm going to be well and truly asleep when the realm's up again! (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=8557299338&amp;sid=2003))</div></div><hr />

Many raiders will prefer a threat mod. There would still be an advantage, though. Since WoW already provides threat numbers that are calculated server-side, new threat meter addons can use less resources on the client computer. The threat values might be more accurate, too.</div></div><hr />

Tier 1 (enhancement): Enhancing totems -&gt; +15% on Strength and Firetongue totems, not the agi totem.<br />

<br />
Please, read ALL patch notes before ringing the nerf-bell.<br />
<br />
The Agility totem will be removed from the game. Instead, Strength of Earth totem will both buff Strength and Agility (by the same amounts as the separate totems do now). This means you get buffed, as you can keep up 4 useful totems now, instead of just 2 (give you were in a melee party) - you get to have Agility and Windfury totems up, and Windfury totem is also useful for you as it buffs your melee-haste.<br />
<br />
The 4th useful totem to you is Flametongue totem, which will buff your spell-damage done. You probably didn't realize this yet, but Enhancement Shamans will be great hybrids as they will be able to cast anything instantly after 5 crits.</div></div><hr />
