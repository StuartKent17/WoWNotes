Battle for Azeroth Now Available for Pre-purchase at Selected Retailers<br />
Which side are you on? Get ready to fight for your faction’s cause by pre-purchasing World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth (https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/battle-for-azeroth), now available at selected retail outlets across Europe.<br />
<br />
Picking up a Standard Edition pre-purchase box before the expansion’s release this summer* will let you upgrade your account to Battle for Azeroth immediately and begin your journey to recruit four new Allied Races. Alliance players can add the shadow-touched Void elves and valiant Lightforged to their ranks, while Horde players can bring the ancient Nightborne and noble Highmountaintauren into their fold. Additional Allied Races will be available in the future.<br />
<br />
Pre-purchasing Battle for Azeroth also immediately grants the included level 110 character boost!<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/march/thumb/fullPPAd.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/march/fullPPAd.jpg) <br />
<br />
The pre-purchase retail box is only available before launch and doesn’t include a physical game disc—instead, everything is linked to the digital code inside. Apply it to your Battle.net account and the content will be automatically downloaded through the Battle.net app, so you’ll be able to play Battle for Azeroth as soon as it’s released*.<br />
<br />
You’ll find a list of retailers in your region offering the pre-purchase box below. Battle for Azeroth is also available for pre-purchase via Battle.net, where you can find out about upgrading to the Digital Deluxe Edition.<br />
<br />
(See the full post for a list of retailers (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1087369-battle-for-azeroth-now-available-for-pre-purchase-at-selected-retailers/))<br />
<br />
*World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth will launch on or before September 21, 2018. Pre-purchasing World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth makes available quest lines that enable players to access the Highmountain tauren, Lightforged draenei, Nightborne, and Void elves. To unlock Allied Races quest lines, players must have a level-110 character and have met specific questing and reputation requirements on the factions each Allied Race is aligned with. Players upgrading from World of Warcraft Starter Edition must wait for trial restrictions to be removed (up to 72 hours) before using character boost.<br />

Epic Pantheon Trinket and RNG<br />
I mean at this point a 5 year old could think of a better loot system<br />
I'd be eager to hear your suggestions on how it could be better. I mean, the existing one has functioned pretty well for the past 13 years for WoW specifically and for the past 20 years across an entire genre of games (other genres too, but you get my point).<br />
<br />
Now I am getting upgrade drops and no trinket to put them on (no offspec), so I have to begrudgingly delete them. <br />
I've gotten my mainspec and I've just been saving them for when I finally get an offspec. I luckily don't need anything else off Argus so I just do him primarily in an offspec loot now. <br />
<br />
I think overall RNG works well in games if it isn't taken too far, perhaps people are just a little over it this expansion seeing as its been put into just about every aspect of the game to drag out played time?<br />
I think that's a fair take on it but its a little silly when its being applied to something that really has never changed. There have always been bosses through the years that have had a powerful trinket on their drop table that everyone wants. I immediately think of Death's Verdict and how frustrating it was for me to get one but that's kinda how drops and loot tables work. <br />
<br />
Items don't always drop and you're not always guaranteed to get them, things like trinkets are meant to be rare because they generally make a pretty big impact when you do finally get one. The concept of loot in an RPG has this at its very core. <br />
<br />
At this point there have been 15 total resets since Antorus opened. 15 total chances to kill Argus and receive a Pantheon trinket. Its not that unheard of to still be looking for an item off of him even if you killed him each of those 15 resets. While its a personal loot drop and its slightly different, it still functions the same way and its still meant to be rare. Its something that not everyone will get, much like previous expansions when it comes to coveted items like trinkets and legendaries.<br />
<br />
Pantheon's Blessings should drop at 2-3x the normal rate once you have a trinket at 1,000.<br />
That could be a pretty good suggestion, however I think it might not be a good experience for someone that doesn't have one at all to see someone that gets one get rewarded even more.<br />
<br />
Just a heads up I'm deleting the posts coming in that are off topic as clearly people aren't reading the previous posts. For those that are hopping in, this discussion is about the Epic Pantheon trinkets, this is not about Aman'Thul's or any of the other Legion Legendaries. I'd like to not lock this thread as its actually been pretty productive and there's been some good posts.<br />
<br />
Wow.. you've deleted my post twice. I wasn't offensive. I was making a correction to the blue's post. The blue said in its post that the legendary system for the Pantheon trinket is the very same system that's been in the game for 13 years. I broke down the leggo system in each of the previous expansions highlighting how they all differed and it was nixxed. I reposted taking care to be extra polite and it was also nixxed.<br />
This thread is not discussing the Legendary systems in other expansions nor even the legendary trinket off Argus. I've said that twice and said why I was deleting off topic replies that don't apply to the Epic Pantheon Trinkets because that's not what is being discussed. Sorry for the confusion but I would recommend reading all of the replies before jumping in a thread (especially the blue ones since you can jump through them).

<br />
Thats not &quot;Arthas' Armor&quot;, thats the Helm of Domination and the Plate of the Damned, two pieces of armor crafted by demons and given to Ner'zhul, bonding with his spirit, and basically creating the Lich King in the first place, and then locked into the Frozen Throne until Arthas came along.<br />

<br />
Maybe Arthas got it along with Frostmourne. He doesn't have the armor at the end of human campaign and has it when he succeeds his father, so it's possible that when Ner'zhul sent Frostmourne away, he sent the armor too.</div></div><hr />

Arthas used to wear them while he was the Lich King, but it existed before him.<br />

He wore that armor before he was the Lich King. You should play Warcraft 3.<br />

Inside the iceblock there's only Frostmourne though and it took most of Ner'zhul's power to put the sword into the DHL package so I'm guessing that he didn't really have the juice to also send him the rest of his armor (btw. he's still 'wearing' armor in the TFT cinematic but not the one we see on this artwork) along with some pocket money.</div></div><hr />

Lich king armor isn't the &quot;generic death knight&quot; hero armor used by arthas or other deathknights in game.<br />

That's not the iceblock from frostmourne, kel thuzad wasn't even there with Arthas, just Muradin. Lich King armor was in the Ice block upon the Frozen Throne.<br />

I didn't say that this is the &quot;Frostmourne-Iceblock&quot;. I merely said that it makes no sense that this screenshot is showing imprisoned Ner'zhul wearing the armor that Arthas is wearing when he kills his father/fights Illidan/frees Ner'zhul (which is the same armor he's wearing as the Lich King later on).</div></div><hr />

No, you won't get anything else other than that (ugly) pre-purchase package with the red bar on it's cover. Since you already get your codes to unlock the boost and the ability to get access to the allied races, there won't be another box on release for you, because you would have two codes then.<br />
<br />
They don't open up full release boxes with game discs in it and rip out the codes.<br />
<br />
So your best bet to get access right away and still get a physical box (like I did) is to pre-purchase now (digital) and get the real box on release to sell your code to a friend that hasn't pre-purchased until then.</div></div><hr />

What the hell are you smoking? Kul Tiras was never &quot;hidden&quot; during WoW, literally one of most important character (Jaina) has family there. <br />

I don't get why these posts repeats every expac. Only continent that was &quot;unknown&quot; to us in lore before it was playable, is Pandaria (and maybe Outlands/Draenor for most people). We knew about other places, just player characters never had reason to go there.</div></div><hr />

When ner'zhul was sent to azeroth he was sent IN the full set of armor. It's not just the helm there in the cinematic from WC3. When Arthas got Frostmourne he was still in paladin attire, Ner'zhul's whispers then led him to the armor, after which he killed his father, all that.</div></div><hr />

Ner'zhul can't &quot;wear&quot; anything, he's a spirit trapped in the armor. Arthas merges with him. And artwork changes depending on who does it, that can explain differences. <br />

Yeah, but on this piece of art it's the same armor Arthas is wearing (which is just his Paladin armor with some spikes and skulls) before he frees Ner'zhul which is a clear and obvious mistake. Just compare shoulders, sabatons etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ner'zhul made him what he was, when arthas crafted his more skully dk attire maybe ner'zhul made him craft to look like his? At that point ner'zhul was basically directing arthas everywhere.<br />
<br />
Honestly it's so minor it's not even worth all this discussion. The armor in the cinematic is obscured so much you can't see what it looks like fully, the two could be the same.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard: “We actually feel the larger community as a whole is pretty happy with it, but thanks.” Fixed that for you.

I mean at this point a 5 year old could think of a better loot system<br />
I'd be eager to hear your suggestions on how it could be better. I mean, the existing one has functioned pretty well for the past 13 years for WoW specifically and for the past 20 years across an entire genre of games (other genres too, but you get my point).<br />

<br />
Then again if he's just talking about the system of monster dies, die rolls, loot table fills and you get what you're given then yeah the system functions but is then usually supplemented by the ability or systems to target and obtain upgrades of similar quality alongside the RNG loot rolls to offset the random nature so that it &quot;works&quot;. Also considering that crafted gear stops far below current raid gear level and that we have no clear idea what other additional calculations may come into the loot drop chances (ones we know about: item rarity, raid/group size, individual gear drop percentages) then saying it's exactly the same is pretty off the mark.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fixed that for you. The larger community does not have to step up and defend what it likes every single time a group of 5-20 people steps up and makes between 20 and 30 threads about a topic demanding they be heard because they're &quot;the Community.&quot;<br />

<br />
They have plenty of data after almost 15 years to help guide them without tending to every brush fire.<br />
<br />
What data? Like 30 people submitted reports and whined on the forums that people were &quot;taking their gear&quot; when group loot was re-enabled because people could greed and disenchant again. So Blizzard switched it back and ignored the few who said doing that would mess up Enchanting costs and prices which is why Enchants sky rocketed until the 2nd raid was out.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the 50 vocal people who got Blizzard to &quot;listen&quot; and got flying removed from the game for &quot;current content&quot; (but still want it permanently gone) say &quot;Hi&quot; after repeatedly using the subjective complaints of:<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm forced to use it.&quot; <br />
&quot;It's destroying World PvP.&quot;<br />
&quot;It makes the world seem smaller.&quot;<br />
&quot;People can get to my herbs/mines before me.&quot;<br />
&quot;I don't like.&quot;<br />
&quot;It's cheating that people can fly over mobs.&quot;<br />
&quot;It destroys game immersion.&quot;<br />
<br />
And then pointed to the fact that people were enjoying Timeless Isle as an example of people hating flying and having fun without it (ignoring the people who figured out how to get pseudo flying working) and how that means it should be gone. Of course Blizzard then listened to the actual majority of the player base after:<br />
<br />
A near six million sub loss with flying being unavailable being cited as one of or the reason among the majority of explanations for unsubbing.<br />
A public petition numbering in the thousands of signers explaining why a significant portion of the player base enjoyed flight and wanted it to be enabled soon (this was before the 6.2 announcement).<br />
Massive negative backlash after the announcement of the permanent removal of flight from the future of the game after having strung along players for six months (though if you take it from Bashiok's post first talking about it in December 2013 then it was even longer) with claims that they were addressing it/working on a new unlock system and it would be in a future patch.<br />
<br />
Which after the biggest turnabout in Blizzard history (I mean the Diablo 3 launch bug and RMAH and Starcraft 2 issues took far longer to resolve than this) resulted in the unlock system we have now, even with people pointing out the pointlessness of locking the achievement until a future patch instead of when the long requirements for the achievement are finally fulfilled and others saying just flat out remove it.</div></div><hr />

This is every fan driven video/streamer. I cannot for the life me understand why people want to watch videos or streams of a bunch of no-life losers talk about a video game.

Yes, I thought the same! I loved the first Chronicle and purchased it, it felt nice to have a high quality piece of print in my hands -maybe the old school (old) person inside me just misses the smell of print -and the artwork and direction made it feel like a grown up treat.<br />

After looking at the EK side, it does actually look like Zandalar is there, it just isn't labelled which is what you initially said, apologies for that. As to why all of the islands and land masses from post the Third War are there, the only reason I could give is that they want the whole world to be in perspective, or some of the lands that were visited post Third War would have been known about (Kul'Tiras, parts of the Broken Isles) and instead of just having some of them labelled and on the map, they out all of them to avoid confusion.</div></div><hr />
