<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boubouille</div><div class="date">2011-04-07, 01:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Patch 4.1 Preview -- Dungeon Finder: Call to Arms<br />
In patch 4.1 we'll be introducing Dungeon Finder: Call to Arms, a new system intended to lower queue times. Call to Arms will automatically detect which class role is currently the least represented in the queue, and offer them additional rewards for entering the Dungeon Finder queue and completing a random level-85 Heroic dungeon.<br />
<br />
Any time the Dungeon Finder queue is longer than a few minutes for level-85 Heroics, the Call to Arms system kicks in and determines which role is the least represented. In the case of tanking being the least represented role, the &quot;Call to Arms: Tanks&quot; icon will display in the Dungeon Finder UI menu where class roles are selected, and will also display on the UI when the queue pops and you are selected to enter a dungeon. Regardless of your role, you'll always be able to see which role currently has been Called to Arms, if any.<br />
<br />
Call to Arms is meant to lower wait times by offering additional rewards for queuing as the currently least represented role. To be eligible for the additional rewards you must solo queue for a random level-85 Heroic in the role that is currently being Called to Arms, and complete the dungeon by killing the final boss. Every time you hit these requirements (there is no daily limit) you'll receive a goodie bag that will contain some gold, a chance at a rare gem, a chance at a flask/elixir (determined by spec), a good chance of receiving a non-combat pet (including cross faction pets), and a very rare chance at receiving a mount. The pets offered come from a wide variety of sources, and include companions like the Razzashi Hatchling, Cockatiel, and Tiny Sporebat, but the mounts are those specifically only available through dungeons (not raids), like the Reins of the Raven Lord (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/item/32768) from Sethekk Halls, Swift White Hawkstrider (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/item/35513) from Magister's Terrace, and Deathcharger's Reins (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/item/13335)from Stratholme.<br />
<br />
This system is meant to address the unacceptable queue times currently being experienced by those that queue for the DPS role at max level. The long queue times are, of course, caused by a very simple lack of representation in the Dungeon Finder by tanks, and to some extent healers. We don't feel the tanking and healing roles have any inherent issues that are causing the representation disparity, except that fulfilling them carries more responsibility. Understandably, players prefer to take on that responsibility in more organized situations than what the Dungeon Finder offers, but perhaps we can bribe them a little. While this system gives tanks and healers something extra, the incentive is being provided so that we can help players in the DPS role get into more dungeons, get better gear, and continue progressing.<br />
<br />
While the gold, gems, flasks, and elixirs are OK incentives, we knew we needed something more substantial. We had briefly considered Valor Points and epics, but decided that wouldn't be working toward the goal of helping DPS players progress, and ultimately wouldn't keep tanks and healers in the Dungeon Finder system for very long. We settled on pets and dungeon-found mounts as theyâ€™re cosmetic/achievement items that players tend to try to get on their own, so why not change that up and offer them a chance to get some of those elusive pets and mounts in a way that also helps other players? Even if they don't get a pet or mount, or get one they already have, the gold and other goodies still feel rewarding enough that it won't feel like a waste of effort.<br />
<br />
We think it's a pretty solid incentive to get tanks and healers queuing, give max-level players another way to collect the pets and mounts they so desire, and above all, to improve wait times for DPS players sitting in queues. In the case of lower level dungeons, it's actually not uncommon for DPS to be the least represented role, and so if this new system works out and we're pleased with the results, we may consider applying this same mechanic to lower level dungeons as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a DPS, I am at a disadvantage soloing some content to receive these mounts to begin with. Now they are being offered as a reward to tanks, who already have instant queues and are payed small fortunes of gold to tank a single heroic.<br />
<br />
I am now rather upset with Blizzard. : /. It's a lazy solution and a simple bandage to a simple problem: It's not that there aren't enough tanks, it's that there aren't enough classes that CAN tank. Like the aesthetics of being a Shaman, but want to tank? Too bad. &quot;Hybridizing&quot; all the pure classes, though it would admittedly be a bitch to balance, would help to solve this problem a lot.<br />

Why didn't they fix that for this expansion then? If the DPS role is a free ride, why don't they reconsider their DPS requirement tuning? o_o</div></div><hr />

Since, once the tanks and healers got their mounts and pets, it would return back to the usual epic long waiting time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want the stuff re-roll tank. If enough tanks start queueing, then the buff goes away anyway as tanks are no longer under-represented. The buff is only in place *if* the lack of tanks (or healers, or DPS for that matter) is affecting queue times.<br />
<br />
Really nice idea IMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Suppose it depends on how much this encourages tanks and healers to que... If it encourages enough of them then you might get it as a dps sometimes. All of the instances mentioned for mounts are incredibly easy to solo anyway... so it's hardly a loss if you don't get it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tanks won't be payed if they decide for that way, they have to queue alone without a group.<br />
<br />
Further it isn't &quot;there aren't enough tank classes&quot;. We have DKs, Warriors, Paladins and Druids. That's 4 out of 10 classes. And that's enough.<br />
The problem is that, if those classes can do something different then tanking, there are many people who go that way. <br />
So, the most simple fix for that is, to make tanking for those classes more attractive, as Blizzard did.</div></div><hr />

[tank] Skipping optional boss's as im farming mounts / pets / cant be bothered with optional bosses<br />

Too bad. &quot;Hybridizing&quot; all the pure classes, though it would admittedly be a bitch to balance, would help to solve this problem a lot.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Also, first; my first first. A first of firsts. Sorry, had to get that out of my system! :)<br />
<br />
As a dps you are at NO disadvantage to solo any of the instances mentioned.... they are all completely faceroll as a level 85.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The Call to Arms system kicks in and determines which role is the least represented.<br />
<br />
So it will start off with tanks and healers, however as more tanks and healers get into the idea of hey, easy rewards, then DPS will eventually start pinging as the &quot;Call To Arms&quot; on occassion. It's a slow fix, and like anything, Rome wasn't built in a day. I could be wrong, but it's like a self-correcting system - DPS isn't going to get instant gratification from it, but at some point down the line they will provided this system works as Blizzard believes it will.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dominating</div><div class="date">2011-04-07, 01:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So how does this work for dps at max level though?<br />
o.O<br />
<br />
It'll incentivize tanks and healers to actually queue for randoms if their role is being &quot;Called To Arms&quot;, and so queue times won't be so abominably long as this massive influx of DPSers and tiny stream of tanks/healers won't be plaguing the LFD tool. Instead all the DPS people who has alts that can tank/heal, or have a tanking/healing offspec, will try and do that if their role is getting the goody bag. <br />
<br />
So for DPS you won't actually get anything new, but you will get shorter queue times, which is as good as a reward as you can hope for. :D</div></div><hr />

I sincerely doubt that only tanks will get teh call to arms. Once it pops, if people are lured by teh mounts as gold is relatively superfluos, and same with elixirs and such.<br />
do you think there might be an oversupply of tanks and end the call to arms?<br />
As once it starts, how long the the call to arms last? does it update to another role in a reasonable span of time if wit times continue to last?<br />
<br />
Can it ever have multiple roles at once, signifying that more than 1 role is under supplied at teh current time?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want the stuff re-roll tank. If enough tanks start queueing, then the buff goes away anyway as tanks are no longer under-represented. The buff is only in place *if* the lack of tanks (or healers, or DPS for that matter) is affecting queue times.<br />
<br />
Really nice idea IMO.<br />
I agree. By making it dynamic they stop it from reversing and causing long queue times for tanks. Also by requiring you to queue solo, and complete the dungeon to get the reward, it should help stop ppl from doing it in something like full dps gear and/or no tank skill since once they try and fail at it they will try to get better so they can get the rewards. The ones who still queue in half dps gear but are able to still complete due to lfg buff/etc, are doing that already anyways bc of the short queue times :P. Overall this should definitely be interesting. I can see some people's arguments that it should just give more gold./items instead of mounts, but I kind of agree with Blizzard that that wouldn't be enough incentive for many as you can already make 200+ gold from just selling your queue in trade already and it hasn't changed queues much/at all.</div></div><hr />

No. The reward as a dps is the fact you no longer have those long ques.... Your reward is the removal of long que times. The fact is if you really want those mounts as a dps you can get them far more easily by farming the instances they drop in.... they all very easy to solo.<br />

<br />
You're gonna get shorter queue times anyway. And most pure DPS classes have some alts that can atleast tank/heal so you at least have a shot at getting the bag on a character.<br />
<br />
That being said, the bag isn't really anything THAT substantial, it's not like you're being tossed 1k gold; the best reward is just some mount most people have by now. If anything, DPS should be more than happy at being able to have shorter queue times.</div></div><hr />

As others have said, as a tank I already enjoy the luxury of basically instant queues whenever I choose to queue up for a dungeon. Now they are saying that besides that I'm also going to get a chance at a random reward that could be something fairly useful (gem/pot) or a rare mount? For doing what exactly, because Protection happens to be my main spec?<br />
<br />
I guess coupled with the new 7/week instead of 1/day thing it MIGHT make tanks queue fairly frequently for the bonus rewards but.. I'm not digging this at all even though I would benefit. Throwing us incentives isn't the right path to get more tanks in the queue, the fact is that running dungeons SUCKS once you have everything you need from it (barring Valor Points which are a whole different can of worms).</div></div><hr />

It's not just representing one role, it's dynamic based on what is in most demand. The mounts will most likely have insanely low drop rates and the pets won't be too far ahead of them.

If you tank even one instance on a tank you've essentially provided 4 random people with their daily heroic. Instead of offering rewards like pets and money instead off some kind of voucher system, in effect 'give tank take a tank'. This system encourages people to play their tank alt or main at least once a day, it is beneficial to the community and the player gets bumped up in the que on his alt.<br />
<br />
It basically goes liek this a Tank provides funa nd enjoyment for 4 other people.<br />
He then gets a voucher for his pure DPS class, the community is still up by 3 other people who have benefitted.<br />
It's a win/win because people will say to themselves...&quot;Wait 40 minutes for a que?or tank for 40 minutes and make money and make gear and get an instant que for my alt&quot; more and moe people will sign on to tank and it will help even out que times.<br />
<br />
The problem with this reward system is that the rewards ARE vanity items. It's still not worth the effort and the headache.<br />
<br />
Think about it, a voucher system is organic and encourages growth and participation, the reward system still puts value on the role and not the players.<br />
<br />
Your time is valueable, you are worth something, you deserve a reward for puttin yourself on the line, but not a reward that you can lord over other players and just stop tanking once you get it.<br />
<br />
It's not the worst idea in the world, but it certainly is not a very good one.<br />
<br />
It still doesnt fix the player attitude and maturity problem. The only way to fix that is to make playing responsibly and selflessly more beneficial than being a douchebag.<br />
<br />
It still doesn't address that a Tank has to devote a whole spec to tanking, a whole gear set to tanking, and loses out on gold everytime he has to respec for his raid spot or arena team.<br />
<br />
Give players a 3rd spec and i swear on my balls you will see more tanks sprout up.<br />
<br />
Give players more options and they will pleasantly surprise you.</div></div><hr />

As far as how to fix the tanking solution ..... Cant be fixed. Tanks are the most gear dependent class, and take a lot of effort. Not to mention, the fate of the group is &quot;considered&quot; dependent on the quality of the tank. This pressure is more than most people want.

Giving us the chance of getting mounts from this is a wee bit, ehhh, wierd if you ask me.<br />
<br />
But back to my point, the entire reason they make this, is to reduce that 30-45 min waiting time you have.<br />
Giving tanks and the like more incentive to sign up.</div></div><hr />

That too. Like I said, I don't know why I dislike it, but something rubs me the wrong way. (And I didn't even farm long for any of the mounts they mentioned.)<br />

I suppose I just hope they don't become as hideously common as many of the holiday mounts did.</div></div><hr />

You're completely and utterly wrong.<br />

4 of the 10 classes in the game can tank. In case you're stupid, that's almost half. The reason tanks are scarce is because, like you, most people don't want to tank.</div></div><hr />

This.<br />
Not so much the fact that tanks and healers get the chance at the mount, but the fact that it says there is no daily limit. Meaning they can have multiple chances along with the regular run of the mounts normal instance.<br />
<br />
If it's limited to those it is more bearable, move it to blue proto, or even cata mounts and we got an issue methinks.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">huldu</div><div class="date">2011-04-07, 01:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most people don't tank because the dungeons are too &quot;hard&quot;. That is the main problem. Unless you return to wotlk 5-15 min MAX queue time this &quot;fix&quot; won't solve anything. Dungeons HAS to be easy for the scrubs. If they wipe or the dungeon takes too long, they sure in hell won't queue up at all. In the end who cares about the 5-man dungeons anyway Blizzard? It's just faceroll content and has minimal impact on the game. It's clear that you only care about your precious raids.<br />
<br />
As for there being too few tank classes, that has nothing to do with it. It's frustrating just to tank any dungeon with random people. It doesn't matter if it's a level 20 dungeon or a 85 heroic. It's the same frustration. People just don't give a damn and show no respect toward each others.<br />
<br />
How about you make a clear difference between heroic raids and not. Add &quot;regular&quot; raids to a &quot;raid finder&quot; system that works like the dungeon finder, but for raids instead. Most people are going to try pug the content at some point why stop them from doing it. Isn't this the reason why you have &quot;heroic&quot; mode in the first place? Let the scrubs, &quot;casuals&quot; or whatever you call them do the &quot;regular&quot; raids and have the &quot;elite&quot; worry about heroic mode.<br />
<br />
I see people hit 85 all day long, being in one of the biggest guilds on the server i play on. For the average/casual player, once they hit 85 they get bored. First they have to deal with LONG queues just to get into 5-man hc's to gear up. That drives most people into creating alts. Then you have the &quot;wannabe&quot; raiders. They are just that. They want to raid but they do NOT have the gear or &quot;skills&quot; to do it. What do you think they'll do once they get bored of their alt? They just quit the game. The only solution i have is to drag their sorry a*** through older raids that i know they should be able to complete. There is no way in hell i can grab 9(85) people from the guild and just run through a 85 raid. Just pointing out how ridiculous it is to have two types of raids - both are clearly aimed &quot;higher&quot; than the average/casual player.</div></div><hr />

Not only are you giving tanks an extra incentive that most of us will never get to experience but you giving them an easy access to the game that some of us have worked hard for. Take mounts for example, one might run Sethekk Halls hundreds of times (literally) to get the mount and now a tank gets the incentive of possibly getting this mount just because they are a tank? Not fair, Blizz, not fair.<br />
<br />
So, while the tanks get more gold, possible chance at mount and pet drops, etc... We, the DPS, still have to deal with the asshat tanks who think they are the WoW Gods Creation to Awesomeness. There are a million reasons this &quot;incentive&quot; is flawed--for one... We pay for this game, there should be equal fairness across the boards, but this is not equal nor fair. While I continue to pay my $15 a month, and solo low level dungeons for the mounts and pets I want, all tanks have to do is simply que... get some gold, some valor, and hey maybe an awesome mount. While we, the DPS, get stupid loot drops, that most of us don't need anymore, a little gold, and oh hey... 70valor. Which come the next patch will already be easier to get. Secondly, this isn't going to solve problems... It's just going to make us, the DPS, deal with worse tanks and thus longer times in the dungeons and then resulting in unhappy, unsatisfied, players. <br />
<br />
This system is stupid... on so many different levels. I was already considering a move to rift--but Blizzard's obvious non-though out &quot;plans&quot; might have pushed me over the limit this time.</div></div><hr />

Yes, because creating a system where tanks/healers can get goodie bags filled with trivial loot and mounts everyone already has is such a huge, crushing blow to DPS classes, equivalent to ripping out their testicles with a wrench.<br />

I'll start back tanking after the first time I see someone actually pull a mount out of one of those bags. It isn't worth my time to mindlessly grind for Justice Points that I don't care about if the mount has a .01 or .001% drop rate, or something ridiculous like that.</div></div><hr />

Yes, there are less healers in the queues and even fewer tanks but as time goes, more people will start tanking and healing to try and get that sweet mount or vanity pet and I wouldn't be surprised if we saw DPS get the &quot;Call to Arms&quot;. Then of course people will see that and switch to their dps spec for the bonus and it'll go back and forth between specs ultimately reducing the queue times. I believe this is a very possible outcome.<br />
I think its a good idea, only thing I think they should change are the mount rewards. It should be new unique mounts so that those rare dungeon mounts don't lose their uniqueness.</div></div><hr />

As a DPS, I am at a disadvantage soloing some content to receive these mounts to begin with. Now they are being offered as a reward to tanks, who already have instant queues and are payed small fortunes of gold to tank a single heroic.<br />
<br />
I am now rather upset with Blizzard. : /. It's a lazy solution and a simple bandage to a simple problem: It's not that there aren't enough tanks, it's that there aren't enough classes that CAN tank. Like the aesthetics of being a Shaman, but want to tank? Too bad. &quot;Hybridizing&quot; all the pure classes, though it would admittedly be a bitch to balance, would help to solve this problem a lot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">isadorr</div><div class="date">2011-04-07, 01:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Patch 4.1 Preview -- Dungeon Finder: Call to Arms<br />
In patch 4.1 we'll be introducing Dungeon Finder: Call to Arms, a new system intended to lower queue times. Call to Arms will automatically detect which class role is currently the least represented in the queue, and offer them additional rewards for entering the Dungeon Finder queue and completing a random level-85 Heroic dungeon.<br />
<br />
Any time the Dungeon Finder queue is longer than a few minutes for level-85 Heroics, the Call to Arms system kicks in and determines which role is the least represented. In the case of tanking being the least represented role, the &quot;Call to Arms: Tanks&quot; icon will display in the Dungeon Finder UI menu where class roles are selected, and will also display on the UI when the queue pops and you are selected to enter a dungeon. Regardless of your role, you'll always be able to see which role currently has been Called to Arms, if any.<br />
<br />
Call to Arms is meant to lower wait times by offering additional rewards for queuing as the currently least represented role. To be eligible for the additional rewards you must solo queue for a random level-85 Heroic in the role that is currently being Called to Arms, and complete the dungeon by killing the final boss. Every time you hit these requirements (there is no daily limit) you'll receive a goodie bag that will contain some gold, a chance at a rare gem, a chance at a flask/elixir (determined by spec), a good chance of receiving a non-combat pet (including cross faction pets), and a very rare chance at receiving a mount. The pets offered come from a wide variety of sources, and include companions like the Razzashi Hatchling, Cockatiel, and Tiny Sporebat, but the mounts are those specifically only available through dungeons (not raids), like the Reins of the Raven Lord (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/item/32768) from Sethekk Halls, Swift White Hawkstrider (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/item/35513) from Magister's Terrace, and Deathcharger's Reins (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/item/13335)from Stratholme.<br />
<br />
This system is meant to address the unacceptable queue times currently being experienced by those that queue for the DPS role at max level. The long queue times are, of course, caused by a very simple lack of representation in the Dungeon Finder by tanks, and to some extent healers. We don't feel the tanking and healing roles have any inherent issues that are causing the representation disparity, except that fulfilling them carries more responsibility. Understandably, players prefer to take on that responsibility in more organized situations than what the Dungeon Finder offers, but perhaps we can bribe them a little. While this system gives tanks and healers something extra, the incentive is being provided so that we can help players in the DPS role get into more dungeons, get better gear, and continue progressing.<br />
<br />
While the gold, gems, flasks, and elixirs are OK incentives, we knew we needed something more substantial. We had briefly considered Valor Points and epics, but decided that wouldn't be working toward the goal of helping DPS players progress, and ultimately wouldn't keep tanks and healers in the Dungeon Finder system for very long. We settled on pets and dungeon-found mounts as theyâ€™re cosmetic/achievement items that players tend to try to get on their own, so why not change that up and offer them a chance to get some of those elusive pets and mounts in a way that also helps other players? Even if they don't get a pet or mount, or get one they already have, the gold and other goodies still feel rewarding enough that it won't feel like a waste of effort.<br />
<br />
We think it's a pretty solid incentive to get tanks and healers queuing, give max-level players another way to collect the pets and mounts they so desire, and above all, to improve wait times for DPS players sitting in queues. In the case of lower level dungeons, it's actually not uncommon for DPS to be the least represented role, and so if this new system works out and we're pleased with the results, we may consider applying this same mechanic to lower level dungeons as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
That is hilarious lol. Hmmm I wonder what class/spec the que will be short on. Hmmmm, tanks and healers, wow that is hard. So now they get more just for queing while others are penailized for playing their class/spec.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renowned</div><div class="date">2011-04-07, 01:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most people QQing about this are part of the reason it was implemented in the first place. The only way queue times will ever go down is if more tanks and healers queue and less DPS queue (unless Blizzard go ahead and change the number of DPS needed for a dungeon, highly unlikely). It's as simple as that. I hear a lot of people saying they want Blizzard to fix the real problem but it really is that simple. The LFD tool that Blizzard implemented is perfect: It puts the first 3 DPS together with the first tank and the first healer into a group and sends them into a random dungeon. Blizzard has no control over what portion of players choose each role. All they can do is offer more incentives for people to play whichever role is in highest demand.<br />
<br />
This has to be a new low for the WoW community...</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a DPS, I am at a disadvantage soloing some content to receive these mounts to begin with. Now they are being offered as a reward to tanks, who already have instant queues and are payed small fortunes of gold to tank a single heroic.<br />
<br />
I am now rather upset with Blizzard. : /. It's a lazy solution and a simple bandage to a simple problem: It's not that there aren't enough tanks, it's that there aren't enough classes that CAN tank. Like the aesthetics of being a Shaman, but want to tank? Too bad. &quot;Hybridizing&quot; all the pure classes, though it would admittedly be a bitch to balance, would help to solve this problem a lot.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Also, first; my first first. A first of firsts. Sorry, had to get that out of my system! :)<br />
<br />
Well, lets look at this from another perspective. Currently, there are several reasons a tank would join a random queue:<br />
<br />
- They are gearing up for raids<br />
- They need reputation with factions<br />
- They need to reach the weekly VP cap<br />
<br />
Outside of these reasons there is very little incentive to actually want to tank an instance that is neither your daily random nor a guild run. I personally am in the very fortunate position of having a Warrior with mostly heroic raid gear (both tanking and DPS) and my priest main who is decked to the 9s also (we are currently 11/13 heroic). For me this means I haven't run heroics for months, literally. Once you get past a point with gear, there just really is little or no incentive to go do them. Same goes for tanks gearing up, or grinding rep. Once it's done, it's done, and you don't have to go through the lottery of bad players that 90% of the time (from experience) blame the tank. DPS that don't interrupt or CC, healers that use their biggest fastest heal and run oom, then complain you take too much damage (true story).<br />
<br />
This system will give people like me the will to run heroics again. I actually can't wait to speed run some heroics, which is what blizzard want. If you dislike missing out on these benefits, then i'm sorry, but currently the least represented class in the dungeon finder is tanks. I have no doubt in my mind that the call to arms will be tanks, every day, all the time. If this means more tanks come out of hiding to help people through daily randoms, whos winning? I think the answer is we all are. You get much faster queues, I get extra rewards for running content I outgrew about 1 reset after release, everyone's happy!<br />
<br />
I mean, if you get a tank with 220k hp pop up in your random group, are you going to be upset about it? I certainly wouldn't be. More chance of success, props to the tank tbh and let the extra loot come.</div></div><hr />

This is kinda F'd up Blizz Way to make more people try to tank as dps.....<br />
<br />
And then got a kick and have to w8 30 min!<br />
Btw you already have one incentive gold and extra valor or justice (not to mention loot).<br />
<br />
And when cataclym come almost to end and everybody have a healer and tank at lvl 85 you will start see call of arms to dps. <br />
Because when hcs will be faceroll you will se a lot more tanks and healer because is not a stress role anymore and get more fun do diferents. <br />
Mounts will probably have 1% drop and are mounts that you farm easly with any dps class. <br />
At least we will se a lot more good gear tanks because now they can't queue with their guild to get this when call of arms is up and probably will use it for daily.Queue times will drope a lot! I bet 10 min max.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The tanks and healers get the quick queues because there aren't that many tanks and healers.. it'll be a nice, free boost for those already doing so, but it'll also be incentive to get more tanks and healers queueing for randoms, thus getting more dps into heroics faster. Pretty good idea, imo.</div></div><hr />

Heroic 5-mans are harder than wrath so tanks and healers mostly gave up (leading to the ques that make this situation). There were only two solutions for Blizzard: Go back to wrath level heroics (horrible idea), or give incentives to heal/tank. With the new tanking heirlooms, this should lead to a large influx of new tanks and some new healers (I personally am leveling a holy/spriest and will be tanking up my DK). Shame on the Wrath-babies for wanting this gone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This system is just going to have undergeared/bad tanks queue'ing. It's ALWAYS going to be tanks getting the reward. Period. <br />
<br />
I actually don't give a frick that they are getting extra incentive... I have all the mounts/pets that could EVER come from those bags. I just don't think it's fair for a DPS who has been dealing with 35-40 min queues for months now.</div></div><hr />

So, the chance of a Good Geared, Experienced tank to already have those mounts are high. Blizzard won't be helping community at all, this will just increase the number of &quot;wannabe&quot; tanks overall, the ones that enter heroics with pvp/dps gear and have no idea of tanking. The ones that just enter for the chance of a cool, rare mount. There are already huge amounts of that kind of people around, the ones that make you bash your head to keyboard after 2 hours of wipes in a simple heroic (tanks that doesn't know what interrupt is, what marking is, what a sheep is), while you have no chance but to continue cuz of 45 mins to 1 hour queue times. (Don't say: just kick the tank than, since even though after doing random heroic with guildies and not kicking anyone from the random for a long time, the few times i tried to kick someone when i did Random alone it always ended up with a notice &quot;You have to wait 2 hours&quot;)<br />
<br />
Not even counting that it is unfair to the DPS classes that has to be insanely lucky or to farm for days, weeks even months for those mounts.<br />
<br />
Even though it currently looks like a way to help queue times, i believe at the long run it will cause more problems than it helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you really think this will work? You're so naive. They would have to do something completely different to make &quot;tanking&quot; more appealing. This will NOT reduce the queue times. I doubt we'll even see any change at all. Tanking is still the same in 4.0.6 as in 4.1. You have a chance to get a mount or a pet along with some extra gold? Seriously Blizzard?<br />
<br />
Let us just see this from the casual players point of view for a second. A mount? They don't care about that. A pet? They don't care about that. So basically you're aiming for a handful of &quot;tanks&quot; that want those rewards. Let me just point out how FEW they are to begin with. The rewards has to be much broader to even appeal to the majority. You see, you have to appeal to the majority of players to get the queue times down.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stonhinge</div><div class="date">2011-04-07, 01:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I myself main tank BoT, BWD, and the Airheads for my raid. I like tanking for these people. They know what they're doing. They also listen.<br />
<br />
I queue as DPS for my occasional random heroic, because 90% of the time I queue as a tank I get a group that apparently has difficulty walking and chewing bubblegum at the same time. And the healer will &quot;mysteriously&quot; disconnect if a wipe appears to happen. Or it'll suddenly be dinnertime. You know what I mean. So I don't queue as a tank. I will, occasionally, swap to tank during a run if we lose the original tank. Generally only if the healer is still around, though.<br />
<br />
Will this get me to queue as a tank? Sure. Will it also get all the people who wouldn't meet the heroic requirements in their tank gear to queue as a tank? You bet.</div></div><hr />

I have little use of a shorter Q time, as I can get what points I need via raiding. Does someone that is dps in my place get anything out of this? I may not be loosing anything, but I still find it odd that other tanks and healers in my place do get something desirable.<br />
<br />
I suppose it is selfish, wanting to get the same options that others do.<br />
<br />
Well, that's just PERFECT that a special little snowflake like you has no need to queue for random heroics since all you need now are valor points. For the rest of the playerbase who still does heroics and needs JP and some VP, this is a much-needed fix that alleviates the DPS queue problem while incentivizing tanks and healers to queue as tanks and healers. <br />
<br />
The goody bag isn't even that big of a damn deal, it's a couple of insubstantial items and a very small change at getting a mount that's been in the game for more than three years. It's still something to keep tanks/heals interested in tackling heroics, and for the dungeon-starved DPS classes who have to wait 25 minutes for their queue, they have the benefit of finally having a reduced wait time. <br />
<br />
And again, like others have said: if you don't like not having a shot at the goody bag, go roll a tank/healer class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Question: Do you has a healor or tanker.<br />
Question: Have you healorized or Tankered in dungeons?<br />
<br />
I have healed and tanked, until my tanking addons broke. Anyways, healing is not fun. I'm pretty much almost 85 on my second dedicated healer and lemme tell you, I have very little incentive come 85 to not do more than a daily a day once I start going to gear up. It's not fun to heal people who don't try to avoid the avoidable damage. It's not fun to heal tanks thinking they can tank as Fury with dps gear or as Blood with dps gear. It's not fun healing tanks who think all they need to do is stack stam over parry and dodge. It's not fun to tank for people who don't give you 2 seconds to get aggro, and complain when you're constantly blowing cooldowns to try and get it back.<br />
<br />
Very rarely do I even get praised for healing a group through messy pulls. Or even being the one to carry a tank through a dungeon because they have crap gear when I'm healing.<br />
<br />
Then also the fact that I've been having dps steal very clearly, HEALING ITEMS from me, it is not fun to continually grind a dungeon for one little thing.<br />
<br />
But given the fact that there will be this? Yes I have more incentive to keep queueing my baby holydin up because I am easily bribed by chance of shinies that people can not ninja from me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, if you think outside your personal needs, you'll realize that there are way more dps in need of dungeons than there are tanks available. There is an undisputed problem of long queues for dps which makes the game less fun for them and unnecessarily more time-consuming to gear up.<br />
<br />
With the current system, there is an inherent unfairness in the game in that tanks and - to a lesser degree - healers can gear up more easily than dps. Now this unfairness is being changed so that tanks and healers instead have the possibility to gain some vanity stuff and a little cash instead.<br />
<br />
For the game as a whole it's better having unfairness in regards to vanity items than actual game-progressive stuff like Justice and Valor points and gear.<br />

<br />
Why is it in this game when PERKS are added(nothing that cant be done by other methods) all people do is complain when that PERK isnt something they can do with their main instead of just focusing on the PERK that they might actually not need to waste 45 mins in a dungeon q. tanking a heroic requires you to have some semblance of an idea of what you are doing and also requires you to use many of your abilites and keep things positioned right, as a dps all you HAVE to do to q up is hit pretty much one button, yes to do good dps you need to do more, but almost every sdps class can just go into a heroic and hit one button and still pass by as a bad player that got carried. so ya tanks should get an extra reward for being required to pay attention to make the run progress. and healers to a much lesser extent as well. <br />
<br />
I play all 3 roles on all of my 4 lvl 85s and did back at 80 on 10 toons. i stuck with mostly tanking and healing classes though, not because it was more fun but because low q times that i didnt have ot wait for. and now that dps will benefit from a lower q time all they say is &quot;man why cant we have what they have&quot; when blizzard just gave you what they had...a shorter q. play a class because its fun, if the benefits of tanking is more apealing to you then playing your other class/spec then choose one ffs. you cant have everything you want all the time forever. <br />
<br />
mmo's are made to make many people happy so please in the future before you come here to bitch about how much better the game was before blizzard &quot;improved&quot; it consider the fact that not everyone wants to wait an hour and then fly to a dungeon and then end up kicking a retard and end up flying back to town just to loof forever and flying back and hoping to finish the fucking dungeon. hurp durp.<br />

The only way queue times will ever go down is if more tanks and healers queue and less DPS queue (unless Blizzard go ahead and change the number of DPS needed for a dungeon, highly unlikely). It's as simple as that. I hear a lot of people saying they want Blizzard to fix the real problem but it really is that simple. The LFD tool that Blizzard implemented is perfect: It puts the first 3 DPS together with the first tank and the first healer into a group and sends them into a random dungeon. Blizzard has no control over what portion of players choose each role. All they can do is offer more incentives for people to play whichever role is in highest demand.<br />
<br />
This has to be a new low for the WoW community...<br />
<br />
Actually thats not how it works... The system will try to match people up depending on gear and, recently added, try to add 5 people together without same armor class - as to avoid people &quot;stealing&quot; the other specs gear. Besides that it would not match 3 melee dps together in a Deadmines run since it would be suicide for the 2 of them making it a hell run - unless said 3 dps had been qqÂ´ing together for a random.<br />
But besides that - yes, blizzard has no control over it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
NEWSFLASH! Tanks and healers don't get short queues! DPS get long queues! In the ideal world where one fifth of all players are tanks, one fifth are healers and three fifths are DPS, the first five people (or close enough to it) that queue for a random heroic will get put together, and everybody will have a queue time of a few seconds.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually thats not how it works...Okay, so I simplified it a little, but the point remains valid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What are you talking about?! You get faster queue times, the entire reason for this whole block of patch....<br />
<br />
I'm tired of tanking dungeons and getting put with DPS that can't hit harder than fail DPS from wrath. The chance of getting shinies still won't get me to do it, because there are a lot of fail players out there, and I already have everything I need from VP points (and I don't raid, so I have seen enough heroics for a long time).<br />

Some say that this is nice so tanks have an incentive to queue: <br />
What is different for a dps? Atleast if youre a tank you got different speccs, that need different gear sets. A pure dps like hunter/lock/mage/rogue uses the same gear for all speccs. So when we have all we need why should we queue?<br />
<br />
Some say that dps shouldn't bitch about tanks and healers being able to get rare mounts in a goodie bag because the instances are so easy now:<br />
Well yes theyre easy, but guess what? You can do the ONCE a day. Tanks and healers can now spam random hcs all day and have a chance to get it in each dungeon.<br />
<br />
The queue times will get lower, stop the qq: Oh yeah tanks and healers will get even shorter queues (like they need it) And we will shave off 5, maybe max 10 mins of ours.<br />

the truth is there are not many tanks on que.That mean people don't want to play tank role... they find it difficult?boring?not fun? dunno...<br />
<br />
but all these people who want to dps and saw their damage meters to friends and be proud of them they want someone to tank for them and they want it fast...<br />
<br />
If you like the rewards, reroll to tank and help the que systems, otherwise enjoy the lower wait time... in both options you win</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wareitar</div><div class="date">2011-04-07, 02:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I am really disappointed in you Blizz. Not only are you giving tanks an extra incentive that most of us will never get to experience but you giving them an easy access to the game that some of us have worked hard for. Take mounts for example, one might run Sethekk Halls hundreds of times (literally) to get the mount and now a tank gets the incentive of possibly getting this mount just because they are a tank? Not fair, Blizz, not fair.<br />
<br />
So, while the tanks get more gold, possible chance at mount and pet drops, etc... We, the DPS, still have to deal with the asshat tanks who think they are the WoW Gods Creation to Awesomeness. There are a million reasons this &quot;incentive&quot; is flawed--for one... We pay for this game, there should be equal fairness across the boards, but this is not equal nor fair. While I continue to pay my $15 a month, and solo low level dungeons for the mounts and pets I want, all tanks have to do is simply que... get some gold, some valor, and hey maybe an awesome mount. While we, the DPS, get stupid loot drops, that most of us don't need anymore, a little gold, and oh hey... 70valor. Which come the next patch will already be easier to get. Secondly, this isn't going to solve problems... It's just going to make us, the DPS, deal with worse tanks and thus longer times in the dungeons and then resulting in unhappy, unsatisfied, players. <br />
<br />
This system is stupid... on so many different levels. I was already considering a move to rift--but Blizzard's obvious non-though out &quot;plans&quot; might have pushed me over the limit this time.<br />
<br />
Please, just delete you WoW account.... And I'm dead serious.<br />
<br />
We, the tanks, choose to play as a tank. You can do the exact same. So there's FAIR for you little muppet!<br />
If you feel left out, then roll a damn tank then, and you'll be in this same system.<br />
<br />
People like you just piss me off... <br />
&quot;I pay for this game! So I should get everything as everyone else does with MINIMUM F***ING EFFORT!&quot;<br />
People like you make me sick!<br />
<br />
I don't need jack-s*** from HCs anymore, so be glad for the fact that players like me now have an extra incentive to drag your sorry a** through a HC!<br />
<br />
&quot;While I continue to pay my $15 a month, and solo low level dungeons for the mounts and pets I want&quot;<br />
Well boo-f'ing-hoo... That's your way to spend $15 a month, getting the stuff by doing a low level dungeon. Hell at level 85 this takes NO effort, what so ever!<br />
<br />
all tanks have to do is simply que... get some gold, some valor, and hey maybe an awesome mount.<br />
Yeha, what if I didn't want to queue in the first place? I got all my valor gear, I got all my gold that I need, and I can just as easilly as you go farm those god forsaken low level dungeons for the same drop-chance.<br />
INSTEAD, now I might have to drag your sorry-a** whining all the way through a HC, while even giving you a lower queue time!<br />
<br />
Is it not better that the tanks join you for a HC a day instead of being stuck in a dungeon where he's soloing for content?<br />
<br />
Jeesus christ, people like you that are so damn narrow minded makes me wanna throw up.<br />
If you look at the bigger picture, this only helps you get lower queue times. As tanks are now more likly to queue in for HCs instead of going alone in the dungeons you too have been farming. <br />
<br />
Please go to RIFT, I couldn't care less if people like you left the game. Once you find out you don't get everything handed to you there either, I expect you to whine just as much there. Please, leave WoW alone, we don't need people like you here. Whining about fairness when you have the exact same equal oppertunity to roll a tank as well.</div></div><hr />

Sheesh...did you get the whole point about this change? That dps will get reduced queue time? How is that &quot;nothing&quot;?<br />
<br />
Being tank or healer in instances require more work and more responsibility - I see no problem in rewarding people for taking on those roles.<br />
<br />
When I tank an instance I am putting in a lot more effort than when I dps. More effort should equal more reward - to me that's highly reasonable.<br />

But as nice as some of the rewards may be, it does not help when tanking when you get a random group, it gets frustrating when people have no clue still on what to do, so this may or may not change my decision to tank or not.<br />

And in reality after any tank gets all the rare mounts and pets what then? Things will go back to the way there are....</div></div><hr />

<br />
They seriously need to pull their collective fingers out and get to work on something to breath some life back into the game.. yeah its great you redid azeroth and thought adding all the old quests back in that people would go do them for the achievement points.<br />
In the 5 years i've been playing its gotten to an all time low after the first 3 months in cata.. same old boring crap and nothing but promises of rehashing things we've seen already.. they should start looking into a new dev team because the current lot seem to be trying to float on their past glories and wow's position in the mmo market.<br />
<br />
Been a strong supporter of blizzard even with many up's nad downs etc but tbh with more of this crap.. meh!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Negrido</div><div class="date">2011-04-07, 02:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, that's just PERFECT that a special little snowflake like you has no need to queue for random heroics since all you need now are valor points. For the rest of the playerbase who still does heroics and needs JP and some VP, this is a much-needed fix that alleviates the DPS queue problem while incentivizing tanks and healers to queue as tanks and healers. <br />
<br />
So tanks and healers need intensive, but dps don't? Why do they deserve more than the rest of us? If this is Blizzard officially saying that tanks and healer are better, or more important than dps, I'm concerned.<br />
I'm by no means special. I refuse to believe that the entirety of the rest of this game is composed of people too bad to raid or too busy to play long enough for a daily here and there. At this point I know many people that dont raid for various reasons, that have three peices of tier, and the offset items they need from points as well. I'm not just speaking with my own interest at heart, I want to see how others in my specific situation feel about this. I imagine it varies between apathy and outrage.<br />
This will help the people just hitting 85 on their mains, but this applies to everyone.<br />
<br />
<br />
And again, like others have said: if you don't like not having a shot at the goody bag, go roll a tank/healer class.<br />
<br />
I'd like to have one of these nice mounts on my warlocks, so the solution is to make a new character that I've invested much less in and will ultimately use much less often, that I might get said items and see them rarely. Brilliant.</div></div><hr />

Call to Arms is meant to lower wait times by offering additional rewards for queuing as the currently least represented role.<br />

I dont get it DPS. You wanted lower times. You want to deal the numbers. You choose to wait 15+ minutes to do this, yet complain nothing is done about it. Now Blizzard is testing new ways at accomplishing this, and you get upset because tanks are being rewarded?<br />

<br />
Easily fixed: Blizzard just needs to make it where you get goodie bags no matter the specc. It's just the current CTA: [Heals/Tank/DPS] gets slightly better goodies. IE say it was Call to Arms: Heals, it could be tanks and dps get flasks and pets, while heals get a chance for a mount. And it changes every 3 days or so, meaning a tank maxed out on mounts but not pets would have incentive to go in even if it was like Call to Arms: DPS, he'd still want to que for a chance at a pet.</div></div><hr />

You contradict yourself with &quot;So when we (dps) have all we need why should we queue?&quot; Well if you have everything you need and don't want to do heroics and lots of others have the same thoughts as you then surely the remaining dps will then get the call to arms because they will outnumber the tanks.... Nobody can say how this will play out because we don't know how many tanks will be tempted to start tanking due to this change.<br />
<br />
Also you can do Stratholme for the Deathcharger as many times as you want per day.... and if you really cared about the other 2 mounts mentioned you'd already have them by now unless you were just incredibly unlucky.<br />
<br />
Everyone wins with this change. DPS will get reduced que times, tanks will have a small chance at getting an item for carrying through all those dps who do less dps now than I did in Sunwell during Burning Crusade.</div></div><hr />

Butthurt that the tank that gives you faster que gets a reward? Really? Really? Stfu <br />
<br />
Some people complain because Blizzard believes this to actually be a fix. That means they don't care beyond this. They have no other solution. This was it. It's scary.<br />
<br />
Isn't it bloody damn obvious after all the years of WoW what the problem is in the first place? I just can't believe Blizzard looks the other way and toss out something as random like this and calls it a &quot;fix&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hell yeah i tank. You can't honestly think i sit in a queue for 30 min as a dps while picking my nose waiting for the minutes to pass. The point is it was pretty damn fast to gear up. Once you're geared up there is no point to run the dungeons again. It doesn't matter if you're a tank, healer or dps. The rewards aren't good enough to reduce the &quot;queue&quot; times. That is all i have to say.</div></div><hr />

<br />
4 of the 10 classes in the game can tank. In case you're stupid, that's almost half. The reason tanks are scarce is because, like you, most people don't want to tank.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pardon me? I -want- to tank. I -can't- tank. I play a Rogue. I love Rogues. A Rogue will always be my main, and she will always have all of my Pets, Mount, and rare/inobtainable titles.<br />
<br />
I could re-roll, sure. But I wouldn't be playing something I loved. I would lose four years of work, love, and dedication. When I joined, was I told I couldn't tank? I didn't even know that those roles existed: I figured everyone could tank, damage, and heal to enough extent that groups could just charge in and fend for themselves. I was wrong, but I loved my Rogue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a Tank or Healer.. there's less reason to queue on a regular basis with this system. It's much better to just to sit around and wait for the queue times to get bad enough that my rewards get higher. Then, I'll still get instant queues (while DPS will still have to wait 45min+) and still pick and choose which bosses to skip.</div></div><hr />

Remove the Valor Point reward from Daily Random Heroic. Your flaw is that any new 85 that wants to join a raiding guild, a guild that is doing raids, not running heroics with undergeared players, won't get excepted unless they have good gear. Those DPS have to wait with the DPS that want the Valor Points for the few tanks that want the Valor Points. If they just remove the Valor Points, and they increase the amount per raid boss, Heroic queues won't be clogged up.</div></div><hr />

Why do they deserve more than the rest of us? If this is Blizzard officially saying that tanks and healer are better, or more important than dps, I'm concerned.<br />
<br />
They are, hate to break it to you. You have 1 healer and 1 tank per 3 DPS, so their roles are crucial and matter more than the DPS roles. Can you carry one, even 2 bad DPS? Yes. Can you carry a bad tank? Lawd no! How about a bad healer? Nope.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm by no means special. I refuse to believe that the entirety of the rest of this game is composed of people too bad to raid or too busy to play long enough for a daily here and there. At this point I know many people that dont raid for various reasons, that have three peices of tier, and the offset items they need from points as well. I'm not just speaking with my own interest at heart, I want to see how others in my specific situation feel about this. I imagine it varies between apathy and outrage.<br />
This will help the people just hitting 85 on their mains, but this applies to everyone.<br />
<br />
As I said in my previous post, I stopped tanking heroics about 2 weeks after release as they held nothing of value for me. Guild rep I do every week when raiding (currently 11/13 heroic). VP is capped most weeks, but i've been selling boots for god knows how long, back from being the first on the server to do so and getting 20k for them to now where I struggle to get 4k.<br />
<br />
This is a good thing. I will tank heroics again if it means I get goodies. Myself and the other MTs and offspec tanks in my guild, so right there you have 5 amazingly geared and capable tanks willing to do run after run for these mounts and achievements. How is this not helping the DPS? we shorten your queue time, we get xtra goodies, sounds good to me. If it means average joe gets shorter queue times, then what's the issue with this?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd like to have one of these nice mounts on my warlocks, so the solution is to make a new character that I've invested much less in and will ultimately use much less often, that I might get said items and see them rarely. Brilliant.<br />
<br />
I see your point here, but then it's like they are just mounts, and youll be getting a shorter queue anyway.</div></div><hr />

I'd like to see a single healer and tank in appropriate level gear take on a heroic by themselves. Think about those two, in full blues at best, taking on heroic bastion. No, they are not more important than dps. Everyone in the group is equal. I do see what you are arguing, a bad tank or healer is more detrimental to a groups sucess. But by no means can you not carry them.<br />
<br />
I've tanked heroic bosses as a warlock because my tank could not keep aggro, or died. I've kited and CCed mobs that our tank was unable to live through or hold onto. As a tank I've cycled cooldowns and kited to make up for lacking heals. As a healer I've done the same thing to make up for poor tanking.

How the fuck is someone getting the shaft here!?<br />
Sure tanks and heals get goodie bags, but the dps ques that everyone qqs about get lower. <br />
You see how many people have posted that they are rolling a tank? *hint hint* That is a sign it is working, and is in a way, blizzard's intent.<br />
<br />
Dps will not be sitting with so many 30 min+ ques with people looking to reroll tank, and since the call to arms is always reset every once in a while, it is a self balancing system. If too many people reroll tank and you lack heals, heals get the goodie bags, so then people look to heal. Should (although highly unlikely) so many people flock to the tanking and healing roles, the dps will gain the goodie bags.<br />
<br />
edit: And if it stagnates with everyone taking equal roles, people will begin to do what they want, and naturally, the balance will shift back to a large amount of dps, triggering the call to arms again.<br />
<br />
In the end, it produces a self balancing, although most likely turbulent system of balancing roles.<br />
<br />
The worst fallout from this choice would be an initial influx of bad tanks, half will learn, the other half will be tired of endless kicks and learn, or quit and go back to dps. The bad tanks will eventually leave, and you will mostly have average tanks and better. Same goes for healers.<br />
<br />
Edit2: And dps, you aren't getting shafted, not getting rewarded =/= punished, you are in fact, still gaining something, it may not be as much as others, but it is still something, you are getting what you asked for, so deal with it and don't give the &quot;It's not equal!&quot; argument, they gave you exactly (or close to it) what you asked for.<br />

The amount of people not using their heads in this thread is obscene...<br />
