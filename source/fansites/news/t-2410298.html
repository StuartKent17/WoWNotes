<br />
<br />
Magnetic Minions can be played on their own, but if you have a mech on the board you can play a Magnetic minion and fuse it to the mech to add to its health, attack, and add an ability. <br />
Projects are new spell cards with extremely powerful effects, but they help both players.<br />
Omega Project - These cards are normal, but have a Battlecry that works when you have 10 Mana Crystals.<br />
There will be legendary spells, such as one that draws your entire deck!<br />

He means the hero though; Mecha- Jaraxxus. I guess he wants the hero to be purchasable on it's own rather than requiring the mega bundle, which no doubt will cost a fair amount higher than the normal shop heroes.<br />
<br />
I'm torn on that one personally, on the one hand I like the exclusive cosmetic only rewards for doing various things like Khadgar or the other Warlock hero. On the other hand though I think it's a shame that some classes only have alternative heroes available through these exclusive means (like Warlock and Shaman I believe). This would also be the first alternate hero exclusive to an (understandably) expensive purchase item rather than some other means like fireside or completing solo stuff etc.<br />
<br />
preorders are usually what, 50 bucks usd? So for the sake of making comparisons let's assume the mega bundle is going to be 80 (numbers completely made up but just adding value for additional 30 packs plus the mecha Jaraxxus hero). If a player wasn't able to get the existing alternate warlock hero for &lt;reasons&gt; but would be perfectly willing to pay 25 for a different alternate warlock hero and is otherwise content to farm the dust to craft cards they want this announcement might feel bad for that player.<br />
<br />
It would be better (for the aforementioned hypothetical player) if the mecha jaraxxus hero was included in the mega bundle, but then also planned to be released to the shop as a stand alone purchasable hero at a later date. At a price point that still makes those who purchase the megabundle receive value for doing so.<br />

I don't think it's a shop hero, though. I'm pretty sure it's hero card, subtle difference. Like, the kind you play and you get a new hero power and X amount of armor.<br />

<br />
Well, if you burn through one mega combo, then have this left in your hand, you can then completely refill your hand to do another combo! :o</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kathranis</div><div class="date">2018-07-10, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone have any thoughts on a situation where a rogue would actually want to just go ahead and burn up the rest of their deck early game?

Unless they introduce new mechanics (which is entirely possible), then no, it's obviously a lategame card, and a pretty specific one at that, as you'd ideally want to time it for when the amount of cards left in your deck is equal to how many slots you have left in your hand. With Kingsbane you could presumably at least prevent the resulting Fatigue, and with five mana left over you can still play something. Maybe if you also run Prep you can do some interesting late game combos there.<br />
<br />
Though it's entirely possible that they'll have some new cards that synergize with it. More cards that shuffle back into your deck on death, effects that happen upon drawning a card, or even burning a card...<br />
<br />
I mean, that's being pretty optimistic. Right now I'd say it's Vanish with an upside in the very late game and a huge downside at any other point. But we'll see.<br />
<br />
<br />
Magnetic isn't really blowing my hair back since it only synergizes with mechs, but having buff cards that have the flexibility to be played as a minion isn't terrible. Spider Bot seems alright. 3 mana 2/2 with that deathrattle isn't terrible by any means, and on some turns you'll be able to play it as a buff to potentially trade a weaker minion into something, and then kill a potentially bigger threat with the deathrattle.<br />
<br />
Omega Defender is... I don't know. On the one hand, 12/6 isn't an amazing statline on turn 10. On the other hand, a 4 mana 12/6 is better than a lot of other topdecks at turn 10, I guess? I mean, I don't think people will actually be using it to kill Deathwings, but it might have applications.<br />
<br />
Electra Stormsurge seems pretty fair. It kind of depends on how targetting works with the second cast. Maybe you could do some interesting things by bouncing it back into your hand, too.<br />
<br />
Biology Project is big ramping, and assuming the text is accurate and the crystals aren't empty after casting, it kind of doubles as an Innervate. If your deck can take advantage of the extra mana better than your opponent, I guess it's a plus, but the tempo gain does favor the opponent, so it might not be worth it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Curious to see where it goes, but at least in terms of the expansion theme and the first cards revealed, it's not doing much to excite me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed. I didn't play many card games to begin with but I really liked the idea behind Hearthstone. I played it in Beta and during launch. Once the 1st expansion released, Naxx? I started to lose interest. New card and mechanics are okay but there are a lot of them. And the expansions roll out pretty quickly. Hard to find time to acclimate yourself with all the new decks if you don't have a lot of time to devote to it.</div></div><hr />

According to the website you can get it in both the regular and mega bundles. The only thing you are paying for in the Mega Bundle is 30 extra packs.</div></div><hr />

There are so many expansions I can't even reember. And the reason I left was exactly that, too many expansions. And it wasnt strictly about money either. I just don't like that rush feeling. I like thing to settle down a bit. Maybe get bored with the status quo. AND AFTER THAT a new expansion. At Hearstone's rate, everything seems unimportant to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No basic bundle gets the MECHA-JARAXXUS! Card back<br />
<br />
Mega bundle gets 30 extra packs, MECHA-JARAXXUS! Card Back, and the Warlock Hero Card, MECHA-JARAXXUS!<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Pre-purchase The Boomsday Project to receive a 50 card pack bundle, a random Golden Legendary card from The Boomsday Project, and the Mecha-Jaraxxus card back! PLUS, you can also pre-purchase the new MEGA BUNDLE, which features an 80 card pack bundle, a random Golden Legendary card from The Boomsday Project, the Mecha-Jaraxxus card back, and a new Warlock Hero: MECHA-JARAXXUS! <br />
<br />

Didn't realize they named the Card back the same thing. That's bullshit.</div></div><hr />

Yuuuup.<br />
And the funny thing is, I bought plenty of preorders and even some pack bundles.<br />
I really don't mind spending some money on a game I play a lot, but if it just feels you are getting milked it turns in a big no thanks really fast.</div></div><hr />

Kinda like those hook claw machines they have in restaraunts. Try to get it for $1 per play or buy it straight off for $20.</div></div><hr />

Brode helped design this one. They design expansions three in advance. He probably helped design every single one that will come out this year.</div></div><hr />

No mecha jaaraxxis is a playable hero like Medivh or the other alternative heroes. If you preorder the mega bundle u can play as him right now</div></div><hr />

Magnetic is really interesting and a good way to get immediate effect. Omega Project will work for long games.<br />
I wonder, considering that this leaked early, what will they do on the 12th?<br />

Also I need to know what happens when a MechaJaraxus summons a Fizzlebang.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marrilaife</div><div class="date">2018-07-11, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the other hand though I think it's a shame that some classes only have alternative heroes available through these exclusive means (like Warlock and Shaman I believe). This would also be the first alternate hero exclusive to an (understandably) expensive purchase item rather than some other means like fireside or completing solo stuff etc. I quit the day they tied Tyrande to Twitch Prime, made the promo unavailable in my country, promised &quot;they're considering alternative means to obtain it&quot; and never ever spoke about it again. In the meanwhile I had a chance to break law and provide fake address for the Twitch Prime, but I waited for &quot;alternative means&quot; as I wanted to do it legally. In the meanwhile promo ended. <br />
<br />
Tyrande was one hero I was waiting for, they made it unavailable in my country legally, and now I will never able to get it again, ever. So yeah, screw them. <br />
<br />
Also this: <br />
And I was fine with that, till they started to crank it up to a expension every 3/4 months<br />
Doesn't help when those cards you bought are also pushed out of meta faster and faster and you're seeing less return Since they're pushing &quot;standard&quot; for everything (for example yearly alternative hero is only obtainable through standard) it feels you HAVE to keep buying new cards, if you want to grind them through gold by the time you grind enough for the meta decks... bam, new expansion, start over. You can enjoy them maybe for few weeks after you grinded for 2-3 months. If there was any &quot;classic&quot; deck that was viable, it's quickly axed by nerfing cards and moving them to &quot;hall of fame&quot; like iceblock or magma giant. <br />
<br />
So yeah, it's a p2w game not because paid deck = autowin but because not paying for cards = autolose. Well unless your opponent dcs... Gone are the times where you went back after a break and met at angry chicken rank players with noob cards like chillwind yeti so you could compete if you were behind on cards. I tried to check it out here and there when they put some promos, and it's the same stuff: casual play - pimped meta decks, ranked play - pimped meta decks all the way down to rank 25. No way you can &quot;grind your way up&quot; if you have some basic decks without oomph.</div></div><hr />

I think he went to go co-found a new game development studio, so probably to work with him. Honestly, I wish him the best. It takes massive balls to leave a company you have fifteen years with to take a risk and start over. I know I probably would've stayed with Blizzard if I was in his shoes.</div></div><hr />
