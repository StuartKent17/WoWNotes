'We recently developed a hotfix that restricts frequent layer-hopping, without impacting those who simply wish to play with their friends. Following realm restarts earlier today, this hotfix is now live in all realms in the Americas and Oceania region.<br />
<br />
Now, each time a player moves to a new layer, there will be an increasing amount of time before that player can move to another layer. If a player moves between layers multiple times over a short timeframe, the cooldown can increase to a duration of several minutes (or longer) before they can change layers again. The cooldown will then decrease over time for players who donâ€™t change layers.<br />
<br />
This hotfix will become active in other regions following their next realm restarts.<br />

Just like all fixes over the last two expansions it is designed to reward the no life and punish the regulars. There has been a constant pattern of no life's &quot;abusing&quot; a system. Blizzard finds out and nerfs it but not until the no lifes have got what they want for it. Last time it happened was when dungeon XP was bugged. No one had their levels taken away and they profited from exploiting. Normal people get to the stage where they could use it and then it is nerfed.</div></div><hr />

Well to be honest he only hopped last 2 levels and only started to do so because people came to grief him due to streaming it. It probably sped up his last two levels by about ~30%.</div></div><hr />

I agree. It was small and probably didn't matter in the end. I also remember when some guy used a bug in the way XP was rewarded for a particular group of mobs. He won the race but blizzard saw the exploit and reversed his xp so he was back at LVL 1. Now blizzard are spineless and create a system where it is ok to exploit. Blizzard won't do anything about it except punish the people who come after.</div></div><hr />

Your argument is that Blizzard deliberately waits until an exploit has become well known and widely used in order to ban it so the worst exploiters get away with it while the casual exploiters don't? That's some tinfoil there, my friend.</div></div><hr />

It's not really tinfoil hat at all. Blizzard rarely ever punishes streamers when they use exploits because streamers make the game popular and help generate revenue. If Blizzard was actually going to be fair about punishments, then the world first 60 on Classic realms should have been banned along with everyone else that was using the raid group in a dungeon exploit. But they weren't punished and the people who exploited the game got off scott free.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the laughs. Been in a lore discussion with a couple guys who have jade colored glasses super glued to their faces.

<br />
The point now is that as more and more people hit max level this is when it can be abused the most in terms of the economy of the game.<br />
<br />
It kinda sucks it wasn't there from the get go, but the first 2 weeks only affected the people putting insanity levels of hours into grinding. If this was pushed back another month it truly would punish people that aren't doing it.</div></div><hr />

Layer hopping is not against the ToS, nor is it a exploit. Its just behavior blizzard wants to avoid. You cant punish people for using the game mechanics to their advantage, epecially one that was so well known by both blizzard and the players.<br />

Blizzard chose to allow it, cant punish the players for that</div></div><hr />

you cant just undo peoples levels, that can MASSIVLY fuck over the game, imagine being level 60 wearing full level 60 raid gear, then suddenly a change goes out and all your gear gets unequipped cause you are now level 57... and so now suddenly you are literally bare nacked and have 3 levels to go. you still have level 60 spells, or wasted your gold on spells you not no longer have. so on so forth.<br />
the only way to fix it would be rollbacks of their entire charecter, but how would you liek it if you did dungeons in 6 man groups just for the fun ofi t, then suddenly got punished for something you didnt know was going on? just happening to have 6 people in the group is pretty easy to accidently do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard deciding to change something is not enough to warrant a ban. Otherwise you would get a whole lot of bans, everytime Blizzard balances the classes. <br />
<br />
For something to be an exploit, you have to, knowingly, use it to your advantage in a way that Blizzard didn't forsee happening. <br />
<br />
Blizzard clearly knew that you can use layers to farm mats in different zones. They thought that it wasn't a problem. After monitoring the situation, they redecided and changed the game mechanics. Now you can still farm layers for mats, but it's less effective. If it's still too effective, they will change the game mechanics again. Just like they would if druids still dealt too much damage. <br />
This has nothing to do with exploiting or breaking the TOS. <br />
<br />
The &quot;raiding 5 mans without the xp penalty&quot; on the other hand was a bug. Blizzard thought the penalty was active, but it was not. So using it to gain an advantage is exploiting. So I'm pretty sure that there was an actual conversation at Blizzard somwhere, wether or not the most extreme abusers should be punished in some way or not.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard never claimed nobody ever did anything bad with layers, just that people on the internet are greatly exaggerating the negative consequences of the people who abused it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Layers are created based on number of players in the game, so unless you are able to force additional people into the server, there are a number of fixed layer in the game, and even if you constantly join different parties to grind mobs, but only up to the number of currently available layers. You can only force additional layers to spawn by having more players in the game, which is in theory gated (which is why we see a queue). Is this correct?<br />
<br />
If this is true, then while i get it that people can farm mats faster compared to having fewer layer, it's not like you can artificially inflate that by doing anything by yourself. This is a big deal right now because there are fewer competition for people for the valuable grind spots so that layer hopping seems to be a big deal, but once the majority are there are there, the effect of hopping would be much less profitable, no?</div></div><hr />

<br />
this is the part people are missing. layers don't come magically into existence because people jump between them. blizzard creates them and when they do, the mats that come from them are created by blizzard. whoever the fuck harvests the mats doesn't change the amount coming into the world - the layers do. limiting layering may spread them out a bit more among the players, but if the increased amount is a problem then this changes very little. <br />
<br />
also, the fact that these &quot;servers&quot; hold far more players than classic realms did means that you have to figure out some sort of &quot;mats per player&quot; ratio that nobody has a fucking clue about.<br />
<br />
for all people know, there are fewer mats per player per server than there was in classic because the realms hold way more people. what we have now is a lot more players with a lot more of an idea of what is valuable so there is more effort being applied into gathering those things. maybe it means there's a surplus per player, but there simply isn't any way of knowing and if layers disappear later and player numbers stay higher than an average classic realm then everything will end up in short supply.<br />
<br />
TLDR: without looking at the mats per player ratio, rambling on about layers adding too much shit to the world doesn't mean squat.</div></div><hr />

Do you also think that people that used the dungeon running in a raid group for tons more exp aren't exploiting the game?<br />
<br />
That blizzard is doing something to stop it, doesnt make it a exploit, but unwanted behaviour, there is a big difference between those two.<br />
<br />
And as i explained in my previous post, blizzard allowed the layer hopping to work like that, knowing that it would be used like this, they just wanted to see how it turned out, and the blue post explained that there were noone with insane amounts of materials, but want to stop it before it gets to that point.<br />
<br />
<br />
The dungeon running is more of a gray zone, it was reported before the beta ended, blizzard did not fix it, nor did they say it was not allowed to run it like that, you cant ban anyone, when you let bugs that were reported several times stay for the release, and the players take advantage of it. Since after all, there is no rule against running the dungeons as a raid.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard does not ban players without there being a very clear exploit, like the xp potion bug in retail where you had to go trough several steps to make it work.<br />
<br />
If they had to go trough several steps in abusing the dungeon farming, it would be a clear abuse, for instance if you had to enter a dungeon with 5 men, then 1 guy leave and you make a raid group, invite one and one member putting a member in group 8 and 6 to be able to gain extra experience it would be a clear exploit and they would get banned,</div></div><hr />

And as i explained in my previous post, blizzard allowed the layer hopping to work like that, knowing that it would be used like this, they just wanted to see how it turned out, and the blue post explained that there were noone with insane amounts of materials, but want to stop it before it gets to that point.<br />
<br />
<br />
The dungeon running is more of a gray zone, it was reported before the beta ended, blizzard did not fix it, nor did they say it was not allowed to run it like that, you cant ban anyone, when you let bugs that were reported several times stay for the release, and the players take advantage of it. Since after all, there is no rule against running the dungeons as a raid.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard does not ban players without there being a very clear exploit, like the xp potion bug in retail where you had to go trough several steps to make it work.<br />
<br />
If they had to go trough several steps in abusing the dungeon farming, it would be a clear abuse, for instance if you had to enter a dungeon with 5 men, then 1 guy leave and you make a raid group, invite one and one member putting a member in group 8 and 6 to be able to gain extra experience it would be a clear exploit and they would get banned,<br />
<br />
The dungeon farming in a raid group was 100% an exploit. It was a bug due to Classic having a portion of retail's code. It was not intended at all and was quickly fixed after people exploited the bug. Yet the streamers didn't get banned because they drum up revenue. This isn't the first time Blizzard has not banned a streamer for exploiting the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sigh...<br />
<br />
Not everything that blizzard fixes are considered exploits, even if people take advantage of it, how hard is that to understand? And here we go again with &quot;It's the streamers hurr durr&quot; take off your tinfoil hat, not everything is a conspiracy.<br />
<br />
The reason people did not get banned, is because it's not a serious offense, they played the game normally, they found a way that gave them more experience whithin normal playing, the fact that it was a bug that allowed them to do it, does not make it a bannable offense. and i gave you a example of how a bannable bug abuse would be in my previous post. The dungeon running that was used however, is not.</div></div><hr />

What you define an exploit and what Blizzard defines an exploit are two very different things. They did ban several high profile players for the exp potion exploit (see: Preach) because you had to follow a specific order of actions that was very unlikely to happen unintentionally. The dungeon exp thing was something Blizzard failed to fix before launch and a small number of players took advantage of their oversight. It was fixed and now nobody was punished because it was more an oversight on Blizzard's part than players intentionally taking advantage of something that wasn't meant to be used the way it was being used.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exploit defined - In video games, an exploit is the use of a bug or glitches, game system, rates, hit boxes, speed or level design etc. by a player to their advantage in a manner not intended by the game's designers.<br />
<br />
So by definition as soon as you use something that was unintended you are in fact exploiting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
they also removed the way you could detect what layer you are in using the /who command for some unknown reason<br />
<br />
looks like there is a 30 second delay when you phase to another layer atm so its no longer instant as well</div></div><hr />

Blizzard ruined the &quot;Classic&quot; feel the moment they added layering to Classic, it was abused so much,<br />
<br />
as for the people using a raid to level, what was the point in having a Beta if a major exploit like this wasn't found, or was found and the players didnt report it because personal gain, Blizzard has done this time and time again, they will not ban popular players, i thought i'd at least see a roll back.<br />
<br />
The layering exploits and the people who got level 60 in a few days have cornered the market, ruining the eco on the servers as well.<br />

This statement here is a balled face lie. Layering has been used throughout this game going back many expansions and has been the means that along with things like sharding, CRZ's (since Cata), cross-realming all previous content in the game going all the way back to the old world zones so people could flying in those zones since Cata. Nazjatar itself is riddled with layering. Use any decent rare finder and one can go more than a few yards and change to another layer altogether. You clearly have no idea what the heck you are talking about here. Which is nothing knew among the rest of the people that have not played the content or just like shooting their mouths off for the sake of shooting their mouths off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't understand how layering works. Cross Realm Zones aren't layering. Cross realm zones are a way blizzard aggregates the realms in a shard into the same zone to keep player numbers &quot;feel&quot; right for an MMO. They are created and destroyed dynamically as people enter and leave a zone and they help maintain the intended density in players over content. A zone with very few players will only have one CRZ, a zone that is heavily populated will have many, and you can see folks from different realms. <br />
<br />
In Classic, realms are entirely segregated and you will never run into someone from another realm. Layering is used by Blizzard to duplicate the entire world (or continent, I am not sure) in order to limit overcrowding. Layers are created based on realm population and are a lot less dynamic then CRZones. Low pop realms have very few layers, and even blizzard has said high pop realms have layers in the single digit range (aka, under 10). In Phase 2, Blizzard will remove layers, as it was just a way to ease the initial zones over population as people go through content. <br />
<br />
Retail does not have layers, they have CRZ, Classic has layers, no CRZ.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, but Wrath had the slowest growth of the first 3 expansion. If there was an addon that gets into the hall of fame, then it's BC because it had the biggest growth.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">caninepawprints</div><div class="date">2019-09-09, 09:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree. It was small and probably didn't matter in the end. I also remember when some guy used a bug in the way XP was rewarded for a particular group of mobs. He won the race but blizzard saw the exploit and reversed his xp so he was back at LVL 1. Now blizzard are spineless and create a system where it is ok to exploit. Blizzard won't do anything about it except punish the people who come after.<br />
<br />
I know of a similar story when Wrath of the Lich King was first released. A guild called Athene discovered they could level really fast if they farmed a dungeon in Dragonblight. Darus was chosen to level, and they entered the dungeon as a team. Darus would leave the group, tap a bunch of mobs (so they would turn gray and award no XP to the rest of the group), then rejoin the group before the dungeon kicked him out. When the mobs died, he got all the XP as if he had killed them alone. He went from 70 to 79 in ~13 hours. He was one dungeon run away from being the world first 80 when a GM appeared in the dungeon at the last boss, told them they weren't going to allow this exploit, then suspended all their accounts. They rolled back all of the XP on Darus so he was 70 the next time he logged on. <br />
<br />
The really shitty thing about this is they checked with a GM first to ensure they could do it without breaking any rules. The GM told them it was fine and was &quot;clever use of the game mechanics.&quot; It was only when he was about to be world first 80 that they changed their mind.</div></div><hr />

One of the addons I have for rares spawns is based on the individual layers, not shards. It tells you as you move across Nazjatar which layer that you are currently in and that layer from one side of the zone to the other is in constant change and rarely stays in one layer for several feet. Yes, all three are entirely different mechanics, though all three have been extensively used more and more as the game has progressed. Get a decent lag spike and you can see the effects of all three at the same time. Yes, Layering puts players in layers as well as everything else in the game. There was a point in Cata where both CRZ's and layering were so bugged that people could move in and out at will, especially on PVP servers. Where one could be leveling get ganked, jump on a main to come back find no one there, not even their corpse. The person could log back on the character they were leveling and that person would be there waiting to gank them again.</div></div><hr />

Repeat. Phasing only happens when zones and npcs move when you advance a questline. In Nazjatar the only phasing I saw was after you finish the storyline by killing Azshara and you find Lor'themar and Jaina with the Tidestone at that new flight path right outside the raid you never use cause you've had flying before. And Layering. Does. Not. Exist. In. BFA. It's only a temporary thing in Classic to handle large loads on the same realm. You're talking about sharding.</div></div><hr />

The devilsaur is being camped by many 60s already, they are owning the market on something no many players can even use yet, farming dungeons, for rare twink items already, countless other things. use your brain, vanilla/classic was not made to be streamlined through in days. <br />
<br />
ANd yes, hoping layers can bypass chest repawns. as well as rares. what are you even talking about?&gt;<br />
<br />
You're talking about entire economies being ruined by layering abuse which just isn't true.<br />
<br />
People hopping between layers for chests/rares you say. Blizzard have stated every server has a single digit number of layers, &quot;most very low single digit number of layers&quot;, even if somebody knows somebody in lets say 7-9 layers, I think claiming that this is enough to torch the entire economy is gross exagerration</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roxyfoxy</div><div class="date">2019-09-10, 10:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Of course it is an exploit. It lets you circumvent intended respawn times for nodes and enemies, giving you more and faster loot.<br />
<br />
No it's not a exploit, because layering is a part of the game right now, which means the resources in the extra layers are the intended amount for the server. <br />
People doing using it to gain a advantage is not exploiting, cause that would assume you are doing something that is considered against the rules set by blizzard.<br />
<br />
Exploiting and Clever use of game mechanics, are two very different things, yet still very close.<br />
<br />
<br />
The impact this is going to have on the servers economy in the long term, is pretty much zero, most of the things gathered right now, are being used by professions, or stored in bank for future consumable use, and the gold farmed are going to epic mounts.<br />
So most of these resources are not going directly into the economy, but goes up into thin air once they are used.<br />
<br />
Also, more and more people are getting to 60 right now, causing much more competition to the farmers, and with the cooldown added to the layering, its a gamble to change layers for farming, cause you could end up in a layer thats already been farmed.<br />
So basicly, you had 2 weeks, were a few people could gather as much as possible, without having much competition at all, its not massive amounts that could be farmed by that time, as confirmed by the blue post earlier.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dont get my wrong, i do not like that you can hop between layers to gather, im just pointing out there is no bannable offense in it, so people should stop screaming out &quot;WHY DONT YOU BAN THE CHEATERS, OMG THE STREAMERS ARE GIVEN SPECIAL TREATMENT&quot; blablabla</div></div><hr />
