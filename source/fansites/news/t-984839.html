At least, that's Blizzard's plan for the moment. The Patch 4.3 Recap (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2469-Patch-4.3-Recap-Blizzcon-Store-Fan-Art-Mine-of-WorldCraft) posted a few days ago should keep you alive while you wait. <br />
We're intent on getting the 4.3 Public Test Realms up potentially within the next week.<br />
<br />
As you mentioned, there's still a lot of work to be done on this patch, so a lot of the content will be rolled onto the test realms over time. Transmogrification, Void Storage, some balance changes, and several UI updates/improvements will likely make the PTR right away. The dungeon/raid content, legendary questline, Dungeon Finder updates, and especially Raid Finder are still very much works in-progress<br />
In any case, we can expect to see official patch notes soon according to an update on Zarhym's personal twitter account (http://twitter.com/#!/talkingcongas/status/117033411083894784) on friday.<br />

Diablo III Delayed Until 2012<br />
I didn't have time to report that last week with all the announcements, but if you were waiting for Diablo 3 ... you will have to wait just a little longer. <br />
We commonly use the term “soon” when referring to Blizzard releases, because we know that no matter how hard we’re working to reach a target, we’re not going to compromise and launch a game before it’s ready. For Diablo III, we were aiming to launch by the end of 2011. As we’re announcing globally today (http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/press/pressreleases.html?id=3552229), our new target for the game is early 2012.<br />
<br />
While this news might not be a complete surprise, I know that many of you were hopeful that Diablo III would ship this year. We were too. However, this week we pulled together people from all of the teams involved with the game to decide whether we felt it would be ready before the end of December, and we grudgingly came to the conclusion that it would not. Ultimately, we feel that to deliver an awesome Diablo sequel that lives up to our expectations and yours as well, we should take a little more time and add further polish to a few different elements of the game.<br />
<br />
The upside of today’s announcement is that we will be running the beta test longer than we initially planned, which will allow us to invite more of you who have opted in (http://us.battle.net/d3/en/blog/3435025).<br />
<br />
For those taking on the Diableard challenge (http://us.battle.net/d3/en/blog/3359129#blog), we salute you -- and now fear for your well-being and personal hygiene. We hereby issue an official reprieve to all Diableard participants, including Blizzard employees, if you want to trim or otherwise manage the lower half of your face. We’d still love to see your beardly achievements, and we look forward to seeing more of your efforts as we move into 2012, but not to the detriment of your workplaces and significant others.<br />
<br />
Thank you everyone for your support and anticipation for Diablo III. We’re still moving ahead at full pace, and we’ll be keeping you fully informed of any news and developments here at Diablo3.com (http://diablo3.com/), including the specific release date when the time comes, so stay tuned.<br />

A big part of those during the summer where raiding is traditionally slow with people taking vacations, having better things to do than melting in front of their computers for 4 hours etc.? Do they wanna make Firelands the shortest lived raid ever? For god's sake... it's a great raid. I really like Firelands and while 4.3 sounds freaking AWESOME it really feels like they rush it way too much (yeah, a PTR for a new big path might take 2-3 months usually but they said the 4.3 PTR might be faster, hell, not even sure it'll be a month). Goddamn Crusader's Coliseum lasted longer than Firelands... :( If the 4.3 PTR takes the usualy 2-3 months, then that's fine. But if it lasts only a month... yeah, too fast.</div></div><hr />

Quite the opposite. A staring contest rewards the person who blinks last, and Blizzard is blinking last. They're going with a pretty simple yet effective move : let people try SWToR, let them get bored with it a little, let them notice the inevitable little quirks that the game will launch with, and before BioWare has the time to fix anything ...

<br />
I don't get you people sometimes.<br />
<br />
Saying that Diablo III is a direct competitor with SWTOR, is like saying an action film is a direct competitor with a romantic comedy. Different games, different genres, different audience. Sure, in the case of SWTOR and DIII there might be some overlap with the audience, but not enough for a direct correlation.<br />
<br />
DIII is probably a closer competitor to games like Skyrim and ME3, but even those are not direct correlations.<br />
<br />
I, personally, am not all that interested in DIII (it's the real money AH and the fact that you have to be online when you play, even if you're playing single player, that have put me off DIII), but I'm very keen for SWTOR.</div></div><hr />

lol you turd. Blizzard announced the delay of Diablo 3 and 2 days later Bioware then announced the release date of SWTOR lol Bioware seems scared and now want to give a release date since they have seen Blizzards announcement. SWTOR community manager had to respond to the comments made by fans cause eveeryone can see that Bioware only annopunced the release date AFTER blizzard announced the Diablo 3 delay.<br />
<br />
Like blizzard has anythin to fear from SWTOR have u seen SWTOR gameplay? loool that game does not have staying power. Launch sales will be huge, ill be buying it too. But Im very aware of what im buyin an its just a Filler til Diablo 3 and Guild Wars 2 comes. SWTOR couldnt and wouldnt make me cancel my WoW sub. it doesnt even look nearly good enough for that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Total bullshit, it was completely opposite. Bioware announced SWTOR being delayed to early 2011 and so did Blizzard a few days later. After that, Bioware announced the release date of SWTOR, being 20.12.2011. Check your sources before telling bullshit across the internet.</div></div><hr />

I really like Firelands and while 4.3 sounds freaking AWESOME it really feels like they rush it way too much (yeah, a PTR for a new big path might take 2-3 months usually but they said the 4.3 PTR might be faster, hell, not even sure it'll be a month). Goddamn Crusader's Coliseum lasted longer than Firelands... :( If the 4.3 PTR takes the usualy 2-3 months, then that's fine. But if it lasts only a month... yeah, too fast.<br />

bs it should come out sooner,nothing stops you from progressing through the firelands even when 4.3 is out</div></div><hr />

Like blizzard has anythin to fear from SWTOR have u seen SWTOR gameplay? loool that game does not have staying power. Launch sales will be huge, ill be buying it too. But Im very aware of what im buyin an its just a Filler til Diablo 3 and Guild Wars 2 comes. SWTOR couldnt and wouldnt make me cancel my WoW sub. it doesnt even look nearly good enough for that.<br />

<br />
There are a few titles that can cross over from a genre just due to the gravity of the title or the house developing them. Much as a blockbuster at the cinema can cross over to audiences that would typically watch a drama and such. I don't like RTS for example, but when a huge one comes out, I will maybe buy it and give it a go. Diablo III is massive. SWTOR massive and GW2 same.<br />
<br />
I agree with the *I thought it was coming out in 2012 anyways* posts. Take as long as you need Blizzard. Meanwhile, I'll enjoy some real life titties. And just that. No not mine.</div></div><hr />

Agreed that December 6th or 13th is when it will drop but I doubt it has much to do with Star Wars.<br />
<br />
There are around 5 months or so between major patches. PTR run will for 8-10 weeks. That puts it right into the heart of December and it has little to do with the other MMO.</div></div><hr />

You act like no other devs make good games as well in shorter time periods, with far-far less resources than at blizzard's disposal. Blizzard's just lucky they've established their ways before &quot;modern development&quot; took place, and they get the luxury to mess around with whatever they want, how ever long they want. Though, from what we've seen, even they're under the gun a bit after the 4.3 has shown. They've always said they wanted to make faster content, but never have. Now that their PC dominance has been threatened, and surpassed, they're scrambling. And I'm sure Bobby's making sure that they realize that times have changed. That guy has done one good thing at least by doing so.<br />
<br />
And, SMH at people thinking that Diablo 3 is to counter SWTOR. They're totally different genres. Now, if you want to say that now's the chance for Torchlight 2 to come in and hurt Diablo 3 like Rift, and soon SWTOR and Guild Wars 2 have/will WoW, then that's a valid point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
your post is so full of baseless assumptions and accusations, i dont even<br />
<br />
besides there is a huge difference between a good game and the best game.<br />
for example portal 2 was a good game, right? but it only lasted around 2 days because after that it was just like clearing the same crosswords riddle twice in a row.<br />
but with blizzard games its more like you never want to stop playing it! their games are also not forcing you into thoughts like &quot;omg i totally have to buy item x,y from their store in order to be competitive&quot; and they are clearing steering away from the concept of &quot;those who have the most time to play are the most successful&quot; wich are both indicators that they are doing it right, at least in my book.<br />
<br />
the only game that came out this year so far and kept me playing it for longer than a week was btw minecraft. im gonna buy sw:tor and play it and im going to have fun lvling my character to maxlvl and enjoying the storypart. after that im just gonna stop playing it like i would with a single player game, since im not into the mmo-genre at all(i dont like repetitive stuff). <br />
<br />
so yeah, maybe wow just isnt your genre and youre trying to force things because you want to be in the cool kids club or something, or you seem to think that hating on blizzard would be what the cool kids do... whatever 8&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
The player base accuses Blizzard of a great many things, only some of them being true. One such accusation is them (Blizzard) being smart as an organization. It's smart to release something to counter high interest in other MMOs, and they have historically done so in the past. While I'm not going to suggest that they plan everything as such, there's definitely examples of them doing so on occasion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope. This is a pretty well-known strategy of Blizzard's (see my thread in the forums about the 4.3 release date) to release a major new content patch within a month of a competitor product's launch. It's been a reliable tactic, so much so that when they neglected to follow this strategy for Rift's launch one could correlate the heavy subscription losses to failure to push major new content around the same time frame.<br />
<br />
Considering TOR is an extremely-hyped MMO with a very visible license (Star Wars) based on a highly successful previous RPG of that license (KOTOR), created by one of gaming's top development companies (Bioware) they would be suicidal not to push 4.3 out within a week of that launch to reinvigorate the product. That said, I'm very happy that Blizzard are committed to getting PTR up and running within the next week to ensure proper player testing of Dragon Soul. About 3 months is the optimal time for patch testing based on previous results and thankfully Blizzard has realized this.</div></div><hr />

Observations and opinions. That's what my post is full of, tyvm. There are differences in good and best games, and there are many &quot;good&quot; and &quot;of the bests&quot; games. You saying they make the best games, is entirely opinion of your part, worth no more and no less than my opinion. Just like how I gave up on WoW a while ago, how I did the same with SC2 because it didn't do enough new and lacked depth, and I was just looking forward to D3 this year. I don't hate blizzard because I think it's cool, I don't give them nearly the respect that you deem appropriate because I don't believe they deserve it, and for the past years have been vastly overrated. Numerous other developers have stepped up to blizzard, and many of them surpassed them. That's all. Opinion. So deal with it.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has consistently released something just prior to any competition for the life of Wow, I'm betting they'll do it again.<br />
<br />
they can't release it on 13th because the new darkmoon faire island stays opened only the first week of each month</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MikeyD</div><div class="date">2011-09-26, 10:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just so over this whole &quot;when its done&quot; stuff. Here's where Blizzard has screwed up:1) Too many reveals/previews far too soon.Sure, it is one thing to get the public excited and talking about it. Fan sites are created. People tell others. The buzz gets started.But, after a while, the anticipation turns to frustration. Blizzard keeps up with the &quot;look at what we got coming ain't it great!&quot; stuff yet then answer with the silly &quot;we don't know when it's done but when it is you will be the first to know&quot; crap. Then you have the typical fanboy consumer who immediately spouts off &quot;OMG wow yes, Blizzard always releases polished games its gonna be great I don't mind waiting!&quot;.2) WoW is trending down. People who leave WoW may not return for Diablo depending on how they felt about Blizzard when they left.I'm sure this upsets the WoW &amp; Blizzard fanboys who read this site. But I think most people know this game is past its golden age. It won't die, but it will continue to lose players quicker than it gains them. Basically, it's like accepting the fact you're over the hill, but it doesn't necessarily mean death is imminent. But at the same time, you have to realize there are things you can't do as well anymore.3) Too long between sequels.I love Diablo 2. I can clickclickclickclickclickclickclickclickclickclickclickclick all night long and still enjoy it. But enough time has passed where the new generation of gamer that Blizzard has somehwat helped create with this dumbed-down MMO, they typically don't want to work for things that we had to. I like to refer to this new gamer as the &quot;farmville generation&quot;. There's a mix of those, the XBL/PSN twitch gamers, the Facebook gamers, the old-school MMOers, and the first-time gamers. The first-timers/Facebookers greatly outnumber the old school MMOers, and therefore, Blizzard is probably going to have to make Diablo appeal more to the new gamer mindset instead of the player who enjoyed D1/D2. It doesn't mean it will be a bad game, but I have a bad feeling in the end it might not have the classic Diablo feel. (I hope I'm wrong on this one).4) Projects have schedules with estimates and resources.Nobody says you have to provide release dates, especially when you don't meet them or you do and release a buggy product (*cough* EA). However, there are many other things that are much more complicated than software development that still follow plans, deadlines and are dependent on resource allocation. Blizzard has clearly failed to manage their project schedule and as a result, we see what just happened, another &quot;maybe next year&quot; announcement. I realize the &quot;when its done&quot; date is funny and hip with the Blizzard fans, but for the rest of us, it just has grown a little old.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cataclysm was rushed. It definitely showed during the 4.0.1 patch, the entire pre-expansion world event, and even the previous patch; who could forget the cog of doom that happened during the patch with the holiday? That horrible bug took two weeks to patch.<br />
<br />
They bought December tv time and ICC had been out for a very long time. WotLK was getting stagnant and they had to rush Cataclysm out. Contrast with the Burning Crusade release date which was delayed past the holiday season. Motivations have certainly changed.<br />
<br />
Diablo III doesn't have a pre-existing stagnating world to worry about. I'm sure if it did, they'd try to push it out as soon as publishable and then fix it after.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not game breaking, but it's not all about their aesthetic design, either. Worgen females ARE buggy, and if you don't think so then you don't play one. Try creating a worgen female rogue and cast Mutilate. See how her back just breaks? A good chunk of the animations are buggy as hell, plagued with clipping, tearing, and unnatural bending. No other player model in the game has these issues. Heck, even most if not all NPC models don't have them. <br />
<br />
Try creating a female worgen hunter and equip the Demon Stalker Greathelm. Does that look like they tried hard to make sure all helms fit well on the model? There are lots of other helms with similar problems to that, too. Do some emotes on your female worgen, and cringe at how her mouth tears when she smiles, laughs, or tries to do anything but scowl.<br />
<br />
The fact is, the model was pushed out just weeks before the Beta ended. That didn't give a whole lot of time to test it. For a good 90% of the Beta, female worgens were not playable, or even selectable for a good majority of the time. Oh, and remember those &quot;inside out&quot; worgen female NPCs that were everywhere at release? Yeah. That's the Blizzard polish we've come to know and love, right?<br />
<br />
No, it wasn't game breaking, and it's still not game breaking. But the expansion clearly was not ready, was clearly rushed, and is clearly suffering for it.<br />
<br />
And for Blizzard to continue to claim they only release products when they're ready? It's downright insulting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah. It'll be all the better when it gets there though right?<br />
<br />
Also the concept art is beautiful. I love the one of Rexxar and Misha.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc0b3cb0c063</div><div class="date">2011-09-27, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You act like no other devs make good games as well in shorter time periods, with far-far less resources than at blizzard's disposal. Blizzard's just lucky they've established their ways before &quot;modern development&quot; took place, and they get the luxury to mess around with whatever they want, how ever long they want. Though, from what we've seen, even they're under the gun a bit after the 4.3 has shown. They've always said they wanted to make faster content, but never have. Now that their PC dominance has been threatened, and surpassed, they're scrambling. And I'm sure Bobby's making sure that they realize that times have changed. That guy has done one good thing at least by doing so.<br />
<br />
And, SMH at people thinking that Diablo 3 is to counter SWTOR. They're totally different genres. Now, if you want to say that now's the chance for Torchlight 2 to come in and hurt Diablo 3 like Rift, and soon SWTOR and Guild Wars 2 have/will WoW, then that's a valid point.Name one gaming producer on the same platform with the same success rate of products. This is not a fanboy war, but when you look at Apple, Google and in this case Blizzard - each being trend-setting in their markets - and you wonder about their unorthodox decisions/strategies, have you ever stopped to wonder.. maybe it's because it works? I don't in any way claim that Blizzard is a perfect company - there is simply no such thing. But it's clearly a strategy for them to never release a product until they're 100% satisfied, and so far it's worked out pretty well for them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You haven't played taurens then. Helms look like absolute crap on taurens and there's many bugs in animations, for instance, ever look really closely when a female tauren with a tabard sits down or when they jump? They've only been around about 6x longer than worgen.</div></div><hr />
