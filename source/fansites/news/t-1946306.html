Battle.net Infrastructure<br />
<br />
Client support for Battle.net infrastructure changes, including some memory optimizations.<br />
<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
Any insight coming on how mana pools will scale with gear in Legion? Given 1.5x growth planned assume not =ilevel<br />
Mana is generally based on level, not gear (Arcane mage Mastery notwithstanding). (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/694295788302659584))<br />
<br />
Re minor glyphs becoming toys - I hope that this doesn't mean the permanent visual effects will not become &quot;30 sec every hour&quot;<br />
Purely cosmetic minor glyphs can be applied directly to spells in Legion for a permanent effect, same as today. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/694295753246642177))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
Will &quot;vote kick&quot; and other things like Deserter be revisited in legion?<br />
What are the issues with those systems that you would like to see revisited? (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/694286992155095040))<br />
<br />
Hey dudes. No mention of Static Cling in the TW difficulty journal. Could we please get it added? <br />
This will be cleaned up in a future patch. In the meantime, check Heroic difficulty for accurate ability info. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/694296194453909504))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Are old PvP Ranks going to be Accountwide, so we can transmog the old PvP gear on characters that dont have the rank?<br />
There are no current plans for this. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/694291034226823169))<br />
<br />
will the artifact talents be usable in PvP? I think I read that they won't and that would suck.<br />
Yep! Artifact traits will be usable in PvP, however, some of these traits may be adjusted when entering PvP combat. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/694294103438131200))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
What was your favorite class in WoW? i'm curious, in world of warcraft is pretty normal to invest a lot of time in one character<br />
Favorite can mean a lot of different things.<br />
<br />
My first class was hunter.<br />
<br />
My first raiding class was Prot warrior (originally 31/5/15 or whatever that was), and that's when I really fell in love with the game.<br />
<br />
While I worked at Blizzard, I mostly played a priest -- my work schedule got to the point where it wasn't fair to the group to be main tank -- that's a position for someone who can show up dependably.<br />
<br />
As a developer, I probably spent the most time on the death knight. That was one of my first real jobs at Blizzard, though I didn't work on them as much after LK.<br />
<br />
I had a soft spot for paladins as a developer. I always felt there was a ton of potential for the class and I really wanted to see the class design support the rich lore of the world.<br />
<br />
I felt the best designed class was rogue, mostly by virtue of how energy and combo points played together.<br />

<br />
It means I don't have to go around finding these inane item components for something that will take up a bag space and can only be used in the broken isles.<br />
<br />
This kite thing can't be used inside Dungeons or Raids or on Azeroth proper or anywhere like that. <br />
<br />
So yes, engineering's glider cape does still provide benefits.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It'd be nice if Engineering got some actual love and attention for once, but these clunky kite things they introduce every now and again aren't a major detractor from engineering's interesting-ness.<br />

Agreed, came here to say the same thing. What's the point of the Goblin Glider now? It wasn't like it was profitable to make them for non-Engineers as is, but now this?<br />
<br />
Just because the Goblin Glider and such can still be used in old zones doesn't make it useful or relevant. But oh boy, you can glider down those stairs inside a raid.</div></div><hr />

I still prefer Hitbox by far - Twitch was there first, but is subpar in technology and handling. They could do so much more if they got their game up.<br />
Hitbox grows like crazy though (http://blog.hitbox.tv/hitbox-is-growing-and-welcomes-wargaming-on-board/) - best resemblance is iOS vs Android.<br />
<br />
It has so many advantages over Twitch except user base - simply because Twitch was the lone hero back in the day (not saying that's a bad thing ^^)</div></div><hr />

It's common sense. Legion is WoD 2.0. All the same people are in charge and they've patted themselves on the back and said they liked how WoD went. They liked how flying went. Everything will be the same. People expecting Legion to be a 180 are in for a shock. I think most people smartened up, left and won't be buying Legion till the reviews are out a few months after release. Everyone loved WoD the first couple weeks (those that could get past bugs and queues). It wasn't until a few weeks went by that people started seeing the no end game turd that it was. Be prepared for another turd.</div></div><hr />

Flying does not belong into current-expansion content. Once the expansion is set and done, you'll get flying, but until then, you'll stay on the ground. :rolleyes::rolleyes::rolleyes::rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Devs seem to forget that skipping &quot;content&quot; by flying only tells one thing: that this &quot;content&quot; is not content at all, but a filler thing to waste your time. If something is content, like it is interesting / engaging, or it provides benefits which are good enough for the time investment, than people will not skip it.<br />
<br />
If I as a game master / story teller in an RPG game, create a campaign, and then put only things in it, that my players want to skip entirely, because they came for a totally different sort of game, than it is my fault. I should know what my players want and design things accordingly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hope it is not true. I don't mind no flying in Legion during first half year up to year and enabling it slowly by allowing people to start farming for achievement (and maybe even some chain quest released in parts over year) from the day one of expansion. What I do mind is if they will decide to wait with flying untill end of expansion and release achievement/quest for it at the end of expansion. They need to make people travel and enjoy world while its fresh, not like in WoD when everyone is already tried and bored with it. The WoD way is the wrong way. Yet I feel that Blizz doesnt care so much, they are already used to the fact that people come and go many times during expansion, that they dont need to produce interesting content throughut whole exansion. Maybe its preparation for F2P, it will happen some day anyway, maybe after Legion when numbers of subs drop even more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um...they changed their mind, and we're now flying in Draenor and they have said that this system will be brought into the next expansion instead of what they first intended, to do away with player flying entirely in current content. <br />
<br />
I'd say the complaining proved to be both significant and relevant. Retards being against flying but sticking with a game that's had it for the majority of its lifespan and surely gathered many flying mounts themselves can go cry someplace else. <br />
<br />
On the topic at hand though, I fail to see how this kite thing is equal to them going back to WoD ways...they've already stated that the flying meta will be in the game from the start, and they surely do not dare repeat WoD so...it's just a toy for those without engineering I'd say.<br />

Flying does not belong into current-expansion content. Once the expansion is set and done, you'll get flying, but until then, you'll stay on the ground. :rolleyes::rolleyes::rolleyes::rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Of course it belongs in current expansion content. It's been a thing in current-expansion content through several expansions, 3 of which were amazing. Using flying as a scapegoat for purely BAD content is a cheap shortcut and idiots believed them (and still do) when smart people are able to see that immersion and &quot;skipping content&quot; comes down to the quality of said content, not whether they allow flying or not.</div></div><hr />

You do know in WoD a SKILL 1 ENGINEER can make Goblin Kites that are usable by ANYONE? And that any lvl 100 with level 2 inn can get the Aviana feather for flight on a 10-min cooldown (that's WAY faster than actual flying mounts). Or that every expansion, barring Cata, you were unable to fly from the start of the expansion until you got at least one main to max level?<br />
<br />
No, you don't care because you're a whiny, self-entitled player only worried about how much of an edge they can get over other players.<br />
<br />
Pro-flyers will always be a loud minority when it comes to WoW.</div></div><hr />

If something is content, like it is interesting / engaging, or it provides benefits which are good enough for the time investment, than people will not skip it.<br />
<br />
If I as a game master / story teller in an RPG game, create a campaign, and then put only things in it, that my players want to skip entirely, because they came for a totally different sort of game, than it is my fault. I should know what my players want and design things accordingly.<br />
<br />
If only there was a consensus among the several million players. What you want to skip, others want to do and vice versa.</div></div><hr />

What's the point of the Goblin Glider now? It wasn't like it was profitable to make them for non-Engineers as is, but now this?<br />
<br />
Just because the Goblin Glider and such can still be used in old zones doesn't make it useful or relevant. But oh boy, you can glider down those stairs inside a raid.<br />
<br />
That's like, 75% of my Goblin Glider usage. <br />
<br />
Teleport to Gadgetzan and it tries to drop you from 800 feet up? Goblin Glider.<br />
<br />
Some mage tried to troll you with an ancient dalaran portal? Not today, buddy. Goblin Glider! <br />
<br />
Don't want to have to deal with that long descent into Vezax's room in Ulduar! Goblin Glider that baby away in seconds. <br />
<br />
Jumping down from Ryolith's plateau in firelands to clear the trash down below to summon Shannox? Why take the ramp? Jump across the lava and glide down with the glider. <br />
<br />
<br />
The main problem with getting anywhere in WoD, and presumably in legion, was getting UP things, not down off of them. Most of the hills you ran into were safely jump-offable, but were too large to jump over and therefore required you take some ridiculously circuitous, mob-infested route to get around. <br />
<br />
<br />
If only there was a consensus among the several million players. What you want to skip, others want to do and vice versa.<br />
<br />
Well gee it's great that putting flying in the game in no way means every single player has to skip doing all ground content whatsoever, because thye can just get off their flying mount.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's as if we humans have the ability to determine our own course of actions or something.<br />
<br />
<br />
Holy crap, are we still having this argument after no flying failed in WoD?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The achievement may be in there, with portions unable to be completed until later on. Can pretty much plan on needing to finish each zone's quest completion achievement. Could live without treasure hunter, but it or something like it is pretty much guaranteed as well.<br />

Don't know what you're on about, I wasn't talking about flying. Quests, reps, dungeons, profs, raids, bgs, arenas. Pick one or more you hate and there will be thousands of players who love them.</div></div><hr />

Ride a big winged Drake to the top of the hill to use a damn kite to glide and don't support flying? Yeah... Nevermind logic. <br />
Why this forced &quot;exploration&quot; nonsense and being a ground bug for months again... <br />
I hate this logic, let players fly, whoever wants to stay on ground can stay on ground, they can pop a ground only mount. <br />
That's the real &quot;choice&quot; and it would look and feel so much logical compared to this dumb nonsense.<br />

Why doesn't it fit in current content? It worked quite well in BC and the need for it to get into certain dungeons. I'd say it hurts immersion to not be able to fly. Why can I hop on flight mount that flies yet my mount that is the same as the flight mount not fly? <br />
<br />
The difference in Panderia and before zones and WODs is they are wide open zones made to ride a land mount in from a design and playablity perspective. I'd be ok with no flying till later in the expansion if the zones were designed like Vanilla, BC, LK, Cata, Pandaria. Wide open not the maze turds of WOD. Riding around in WOD on a land mount was a chore and a task. I felt like I was fighting to get from A to B.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WoD zone design would have been fine... if we had had flying mounts. They're far more interesting looking than most of the zones of old. <br />
<br />
<br />
I actually think WoD's zone designs were great. HAD their been flying, I'd have had no problem with them, and I have no problem with them now, seeing as I can fly around them easy as I please. <br />
<br />
But yes, when they were &quot;current&quot; they were exceptionally annoying. And it seems like every little path and byway had some cluster of wandering mobs that would accost you if you tried to hoof it over a small hill. <br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard should keep designing interesting looking zones like WoD zones... But just have flying be a part of it from the start.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd say the complaining proved to be both significant and relevant. Retards being against flying but sticking with a game that's had it for the majority of its lifespan and surely gathered many flying mounts themselves can go cry someplace else. <br />
<br />
On the topic at hand though, I fail to see how this kite thing is equal to them going back to WoD ways...they've already stated that the flying meta will be in the game from the start, and they surely do not dare repeat WoD so...it's just a toy for those without engineering I'd say.<br />

I see his point, you can do a lot more with the leveling experience without flying. You just simply can't build an enjoyable exploration experience with flying mounts enabled, the world is just too small for that in wow. They really got creative in WoD with non-flying exploration and it was a blast to quest through those areas. But really.. I've never seen someone so hurt by others opinions. The community is split 50/50 on this topic, get over it.</div></div><hr />

Matter of opinion. YOU might not be able to enjoy exploration with flying, you don't speak for everyone though. I on the other hand have had some of my best exploration WITH flying. Taking to the skies in Jade Forest for the first time @ 90 to visit all those places I couldn't whilst grounded, going into Storm Peaks the first time, soaring over EK/Kalimdor in Cataclysm and so on. See? Entirely possible to build an enjoyable exploration experience with flying mounts in mind. In fact, when they know that we'll be flying over areas eventually, they can't get away with making a 2d-landscape as easily. Plenty of the most beloved content was made just fine with flight in mind, how's that possible by your logic? :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
The people that for some reason can't enjoy themselves if they fly have their compromise. Those of us that love flying for the fantasy and exploration aspect it brings to our gaming experience, have our compromise. There's no hurt here, other than from the people that aren't happy with the compromise. I'm not one of those people. Blizzard have to move forward unable to create lazy fishbowl zones and on-rails leveling experiences as a result so we've all won in the end.</div></div><hr />

Absolutely. I'm fine with it either way. Yeah if they do decide to add flying later in the expansion, some of the areas designed without flying in mind may feel a little dead. But i think it's silly to imply these new zones take any less work or resources just because they are designed for ground mounts. They may seem smaller from the air in comparison to past expansion zones, but they also squeezed as much content as they could out these zones and really use them to their full potential. But an area or 2 designed specially for flying would be cool to see nowadays as blizzards world creation methods have changed a lot and i would be interested to see what they come up with. But, like i said, the community seems to be split 50/50 and Blizzard has always regretted adding flying mounts, and their stance is pretty clear these days too, so it's obvious who they're going to side with.<br />

... They sided with the people that want flying, by backing up on their decision to discontinue flight in future game content and for WoD. They compromised, and that's all there is to it. People wanting them to back on that compromise and either remove flying entirely, or allow it all the time everywhere for just a small gold cost, can sod right off. I love flying (seeing someone flying on a Gryphon made me try the game) and I'm happy with the compromise. In fact I've liked it more in WoD, having flying for ALL alts as soon as they set foot on Draenor and making obtaining it a thing for dedicated people.</div></div><hr />

They just nerfed the kite to the ground and told people wait for &quot;mid expansion&quot;; aka 1 year to see flight in the game.</div></div><hr />
