Brewmaster damage doesn't even exist. Nerf them anymore and their hits will start to heal the target instead.<br />
<br />
These are updates to the PTR calculations to reflect our hotfixes this week. You'll notice that all of them are exactly 10% reductions - in line with what Blizzard said they would be - without these changes we would go back to the un-nerfed damage as soon as the patch went live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well there's a difference when they are justified vs when they are plain retarded ones. I don't play prot pal or brewmaster, and i still don't think those changes were needed. 10% nerf for every tank when they are not performing the same dps wise is kinda lazy. I also don't play rogue, but 30% nerf for pvp sounds quite a bit extreme.<br />
<br />
No one is saying nerfs were not needed, but the way they manage these things is really disturbing for some people. I am really sorry for elemental shaman lovers. Tears are not the same as not understanding why this is happening for the most part.<br />
<br />
In fact, i am maining Demon Hunter and i believe the AoE nerf was well deserved.</div></div><hr />

while you are right about this just being a tooltip update to the correct live figures, the person you quoted isn't wrong about it being a shit heal that was nerfed previously for no good reason other than PVP &quot;balance&quot; because people whined on enough about it during beta, not to mention it is exclusive to fire, and requires a heavy investment in artifact power traits unless you &quot;waste&quot; relic slots on the ability, other than this, mages are the only class without ANY baseline self sustain of any sort, every class in game has a way to heal up dmg AND mitigate some of the incoming damage, mages got a nerfed ice barrier, and a spec specific artifact weapon trait that is nearly useless when monsters are hitting for 200-300k+ in most situations or if you run into a weak monster, 60k+ which is more than i can heal per tick of CB and i have 1.8M health, it has forced me to go back to vanilla playstyle mode of pulling one mob at a time before moving to the next one, it was shite back then, it is utterly shite now.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raincrow</div><div class="date">2016-09-22, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really don't get this. Since when have Druid and Brewmaster cared at all about armor? They are basically soak classes, and health is really the only boost that matters for them. Why change something that costs MILLIONS of AP to something they (and I) am not going to care about at all? And the nerfs to Prot and Fire mage sustain make absolutely no sense to me at all. 15% at rank 3 was in no way game breaking, and to get anything higher you were required to sacrifice significant DPS gains in those slots. I'm just generally confused by Blizzards thinking in all this.</div></div><hr />

Its just more annoying to use than it should be and this is because the UI flow was done by amateurs<br />
<br />
How it can be fixed, the first thing is that it should by default list all your characters who can participate. The character list should never ever require me to list all characters, half the time if not more it simply lists two characters I already did work on. Why should I have to prompt it to list characters I have completed missions on or have mission openings they can send followers on? As it stands now I have to go through each damn character to find the ones I need to finish and then after each character I have to ask for a list of ALL characters. It also fails to show when missions are listed what the actual ability that needs to be countered is which is wholly unlike the in game interface. <br />
<br />
So, fix this thing Blizzard. Its shameful how bad it is. So cumbersome I only use it when I have no other choice</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly, did they have to nerf an already shitty ability (Consumption) to be even worse? It's complete trash for anything but an emergency heal in AOE situations. Death Strike hits harder single target with our golden dragon trait that buffs it 25%. I think that only Frost DKs get a more underwhelming Artifact ability.</div></div><hr />

It was lowered in effect in a rather brute force way. It should have just had diminished effect above Level 100. This was done to make them NOT attractive for Legion. They do not want us using stuff from past expansions, especially enchants or consumables, in the current. Anything that gives character power should not carry over to the next expansion's early end game possibilities.</div></div><hr />

At the moment they are mostly a 5% dps increase or 5% healing increase or 10% armor increase for each level. Currently if you are dual spec and a few levels behind it is not a huge difference. But once these hit being 20% behind on dps or healing seems severe....and encourages over playing. These new 20 levels dont increase so exponentially in AP required as levels 1-34 which also encourages playing for a huge time after the patch to max out dps or healing or armor. I dont like this design at all - hope I am misunderstanding something or am wrong in the way I've interpreted the trees.</div></div><hr />
