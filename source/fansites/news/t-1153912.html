Nice try, Blizzard. Unless Mists launches with the promise of having no BS-tiers like Firelands and Dragon Soul after the initial tier of goodness, you'll have to try a little harder.</div></div><hr />

They MADE kickass cinematics in the 90s. Around 2007, the rest of the world caught up, and Blizzard's cinematics got worse. Imho.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It doesnt mean a fixed date BUT it means a scheduled date after the cinematic.that might be 1 month timeframe or a 2 week time frame.<br />
<br />
Also i checked the dates.Its friday on the 16 so if they announce the pre-patch that day it will be at the 22 of august that they will implement it(the whole wendsday thing)and after that it will be a 2 weeks test(as some people said about the pre-patch)so the best you can expect <br />
<br />
4-5 of september<br />
<br />
After that if they keep missing wendsdays they will be adding 1 extra week for each one missed.</div></div><hr />

You should watch their behind-the-cinematics videos from Blizzcon. It took them almost a year to make the Cataclysm intro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I still do expect a release date within the next week or so, simply because, now that ArenaNet has set their release date, Blizzard will try to crash into it for their own benefit. The cinematic will be unveiled at the event in August, and the game will probably wind up on shelves within the following week.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has really overhauled MoP, trying to compete with the finalization events for Guild Wars. Opening beta announcements for GW2, a week later, the MoP beta is announced, Live-beta announcements for GW2, MoP beta goes live a week later. Now that we've heard a release date, I'm quite interested to see if my prediction will be correct.</div></div><hr />

You made some good points, and I do think people generally have underestimated how tied the MoP release is tied to Blizz competing (and/or being worried about) GW2. They should be, it's looking awfully good and the first real competition for wow. It's not a coincidence that the GW2 release date was announced yesterday and the next day we get the opening cinematic date from Blizz. I also think Blizz was waiting for the GW2 release date announcement to upstage them with doing the MoP release date. I think you'll see Blizz continue that pattern, with them announcing/releasing pieces of MoP shortly after GW2 dates.</div></div><hr />

When WotLK released mid November, the following Brewfest(you know, almost a year later) featured renamed trinkets that you could buy with points at the beginning of the expansion. Brewfest gear has never been close to comparable with the latest tier.<br />
<br />
Blizzard needs to keep their people busy, and maybe not everyone is qualified to do the work that is needed to polish off Mists, so maybe they put people on doing relatively unimportant(but still necessary) stuff like updating holiday gear?

If there was no need to update Brewfest, then why do it in the MoP release? It would be a wasted resource. If MoP was not being released before Brewfest, then they could wait till after MoP release to update Brewfest for the following year.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Funny, they really waited for GW2 announcements before making theirs.<br />
<br />
I wholeheartedly agree, and it's not coincidence to me. I expected a large announcement from Blizzard when I read that ArenaNet announced their release date for GW2. They have made every move based on what news they got from ArenaNet, and I still find it entertaining.<br />
<br />
Mike O'brien and several other members of ArenaNet were the system designers for ALL of Blizzard Entertainment's games. I'm sure there is PLENTY of butthurt on Blizzard's end because it's basically Activison versus the ORIGINAL creators of the current number 1 mmo.<br />
<br />
I know a lot of people spread this crap around about &quot;Oh, this is gonna kill WoW, and &quot;WoW is always gonan be the greatest thing that has ever happened to the gaming industry,&quot; and honestly, I don't know. I CAN tell you that with former Blizzard system designers and game developers on ArenaNet's side, fully aware of what Blizzard is capable of, ArenaNet has the capability to do some damage. So far, yes, everything on their end is much better from the overall game design, to the simple customer service and interaction with the fan base in a POSITIVE manner. ArenaNet has ASKED people what they wanted in a game, and credited all of us with making their game what is is now. Blizzard has criticized, and told US what we wanted, and basically given us a really crappy &quot;beat-around-the-bush&quot; attitude. We will see what impact it has on MoP.<br />
<br />
I've seen endless promotions and what I'd call bribes, to keep people hanging around Warcraft. Activision-Blizzard has also thrown out a ton of half-assed games this year in order to keep themselves up there after losing such a large fan base, and also to combat any other rival games that were jumping up the boards, or looked potentially threatening. It's getting pathetic, really.<br />
<br />
With that being said, I've seen the suit, but they could surprise me. As far as I'm predicting, expect a release date posted up here on MMO-Champion by the end of next week. We will see what half a year of work, compared to over 5 years of work can do. Blizzard can't rely on their reputation to hit a homer for the sales office records this year. I would imagine at this point, they will push out the same time as GW2 so that they can at least give themselves a false sense of satisfaction provided they manage to sell more copies of their game on opening day.<br />
<br />
I wish both companies luck on sales this year, but for me personally, this World of Warcraft is getting old, and I'm seeing something new in a whole different area of gaming. This is MY personal opinion, and I will take that. I've worked with Blizzard entertainment before, and it's nothing personal. Some of the systems that were being switched out in cataclysm, for things such as looting were designed and incorporated with my assistance.<br />
<br />
I take great pride in a game that I was able to be a part of more than just by playing, and I won't forget the first steps I took on Azeroth, and noticing how huge the world was. Now, it no longer seems so large, and things are all too much the same. For a lot of people, their time is done, and that's fine, it's their choice. For others, normal is a comfort zone. Things being the same is good, and it's safe; but for others, such as myself, our time here is done, and it's time to venture out into new worlds, and discover new and exciting things. For those who are also interested in doing so, step forth knowing that you can always go back at anytime. Everything will be waiting for you, changed or unchanged. Whether you decide to move on or stay behind is ultimately your choice. Don't let anyone judge you on that decision. The beauty of having the ability to make choices is that you can make those choices, uninfluenced by others. After all, if you're simply going to do something because other people influence you, what good is having the ability to do your own thing?</div></div><hr />

While the traditional beta end dates and expansion release dates might seem to predict a late-mid august release date, I think that people are ignoring some other key signs that point to a september release date. First off, we dont know when the beta will end. While many people say it seems to be the most refined product of any expansion beta, that doesnt necessarily mean bliz thinks its close to ready. We are still getting into the raid testing, and after about a week or two we might start look at heroic testing, and then theres still a lot of quests and dailies and other things like gear, reputation rewards, etc. that have yet to be released. I think the beta will last for another 4 weeks, which would correlate to a late august release date based on the past few expansions. But then theres the other signs, like the cinematic and the new book, which is being released where we assumed mop would release, so im thinking that the expansion wont be released until early-mid september, my guess would be the 11th but i think bliz might have strong reservations from releasing it on that day.</div></div><hr />

I never realized before that girlfriends were the link to someone's family member - my bad. And mmo-champion isn't blizzard. I was thinking more along the lines of you getting into beta through the family member so blizzard would connect it with your battle.net account.</div></div><hr />

This may shorten the time periods we were accustomed too (i.e. 2 months after release date announcement is release). The cinematic is released mid August, it is not unlikely the expac could be the week after being that 5.0 is blue confirmed only going to be up for 2 weeks this time around.<br />
<br />
I see it like this:<br />
<br />
August 7th or 14th: 5.0 released<br />
August 16th: Cinematic revealed<br />
August 21st or 28th: MoP released</div></div><hr />

I would hope the other way around, Blizzard has always produced the best game cinematics I've ever seen. By far the best thing about Diablo 3 is its cinematics, just from Azmodan's gluttonish face appearing out of nowhere to the Silver Gates' destruction in the High Heavens. Not to mention Deathwing erupting out of the ground or The Lich King resurrecting Sindragosa. They sure have a lot to live up to today, and I sure hope they can represent it properly in the MoP cinematic.<br />

Nope, that's just plain stupid. I say early/mid September, that's by far the most likely release date. Anyone that expected a July/August release was being to optimistic, anyone expecting an October release is being too negative.</div></div><hr />

Like they would actually get noticeable competition from a B2P game.<br />
<br />
Everyone saying a long time after the cinematic.. every other expansion it was 2-4 weeks after that the expansion came out from the cinematic.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skillym</div><div class="date">2012-06-29, 08:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still do expect a release date within the next week or so, simply because, now that ArenaNet has set their release date, Blizzard will try to crash into it for their own benefit. The cinematic will be unveiled at the event in August, and the game will probably wind up on shelves within the following week.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has really overhauled MoP, trying to compete with the finalization events for Guild Wars. Opening beta announcements for GW2, a week later, the MoP beta is announced, Live-beta announcements for GW2, MoP beta goes live a week later. Now that we've heard a release date, I'm quite interested to see if my prediction will be correct.<br />
<br />
I seriously doubt Blizzard is too concerned about GW2 or basing their release date around it. Warhammer and Star Wars were far bigger IPs with sub models. I know that some of you mmo-champs are pretty excited about GW2, but the majority of WoW's playerbase has never even heard of Guild Wars. And the few who are familiar with GW, at least in my experience, absolutely hate the original game. People I know who (temporarily) left WoW for Warhammer, Rift and SWTOR have no intention of even trying GW2 because of their negative experiences with its predecessor.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong. Some WoW players will quit for GW2, but it's more likely that current WoW players (who are wiling to try GW2) will play both games, since GW2 has no sub and doesn't include many MMORPG staples (like raiding). Personally, I wouldn't buy GW2 until it's under $30 and I'm between content in MoP. Leveling, questing, 5 man dungeons and rifts...err I mean &quot;dynamic events&quot; aren't exactly selling points in my book.</div></div><hr />

I don't think we will see the release before those dates. They don't want eveyone to have epic trinkets/rings/weapons after a few weeks of the launch. Somewhere in november sounds most likely to me. It also fits perfectly with the release dates we've seen in previous expansion and it will be right after the first people are done with their annual pass deal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They will absolutely never change release dates based around a few items in game. A gaming company would first 100% remove the in game events before even thinking about changing what they want their optimal release date to be. Blizzard is no exception.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard is gona release the game when they think its ready...jugding from the beta it looks like its coming along..they are implementing the gear into the files. Raid testing is always final and the testing looks great atm...a few undertuned fights but nevertheless its progressive.<br />

Doubt we will see it that late, it goes right on top of Brewfest and Hallows End.<br />
<br />
Looking at a September 11th release date. A few weeks after the cinematic, two weeks after Guild Wars 2, and 1 1/2 weeks before Brewfest. They wouldn't release it when Brewfest or Hallows End is going on, and Hallows End ends October 31st, which is too far after the cinematics release date to be feasible.<br />
<br />
Not to mention both Brewfest and Hallow's End's loot tables have already been updated to level 90.</div></div><hr />

It depends on what level that gear will be. They can easily nerf it to make it on par with heroic dungeon gear if needed. Keep in mind that after a few weeks, people will likely have access to the Raid Finder and will have decent enough gear available anyway.</div></div><hr />

I doubt it. Blizzard is still a respectable company and I doubt they'd want their game to be associated with a day when americans are remembering a tragic moment of their history. I know I wouldn't because it would be kind of bad taste. And, I also doubt they'd release in other parts of world only to have it delayed in US.<br />
<br />
<br />

Which is precisely why GW2 is a competitor. If WoW players find GW2 even 75% as good as their game, WoW, or more, they might not return to WoW because another game does at least make them 75% happy, with the difference that it does it for free. If they think GW 2 is as good as WoW or even better, there's a high chance they won't return to WoW at all because... GW 2 is better and for free.<br />
There are exceptions with people who want to play both, but this will again harm WoW if said people find GW2 good, because what do you think people will do in the 4 months of break assuming they finish normal raids of WoW and Blizzard continues their 6 month patch cycle? They'll take a break and go to GW2, not paying Blizzard for 4 months.<br />
<br />
All in all, it's all great, for with competition, Blizzard will wake up and hopefully bring better content faster, just as before. Competition is good, monopoly is not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldn't call the best cinematic CGI I have ever seen, period, inefficient. It just wouldn't work. I would say they have a small team. I actually believe their team is only 4-6 big, and that's even for all the games? Not entirely sure.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
I have to say I did not even think of that.<br />
<br />
They would still probably release it on either the 4th or even on a Wednesday or Thursday before holding it back a full two months just because of some in-game event. Being a company doing something that would cut profits drastically or hold back something for no good reason would be a very un-smart thing to do.<br />

Even if GW2 is a purely brilliant game, the only reason people would quit WoW is if they where bored of it, and there would be no difference to them quitting now. GW2 wouldn't be a noticeable factor. If they where still having fun with WoW and they would still be playing it they wouldn't quit for GW2, being a B2P game.<br />
<br />
They have more competition to worry about from SW and Rift then they do from GW2, even if GW2 has 5x the popularity of both of those combined.</div></div><hr />

Because there isn't centered villain like in WoTLK and Cata, yes? I was kinda disappointed on Cata (but it still epic anyway), because i was expecting Worgens and Goblins on the cinematic scene just like how they introduced Draenei and Blood Elf on BC in a very epic way without forgetting the main villain itself. Perhaps there will be Panda here and there, but please do the fighting scene between each race again Blizz!! I miss the Horde vs Alliance essence just like what you've often said, the war is getting more intense!! :D</div></div><hr />

Blizzard is still a respectable company and I doubt they'd want their game to be associated with a day when americans are remembering a tragic moment of their history. I know I wouldn't because it would be kind of bad taste. And, I also doubt they'd release in other parts of world only to have it delayed in US. <br />
<br />
What was the day Cataclysm was released? December 7th, what is also Decemeber 7th? The day of Pearl Harbor so I still see them releasing it this day and it happened what over 10 years ago?</div></div><hr />

Release will probably be the 4th of Sept or the 11th. Blizzard doesnt update loot for nothing and it was datamined by mmo-champ.<br />
<br />
Do you know how many pieces of gear never saw the light of day? The entire heirloom pants never showed up. <br />
<br />
Also considering the brewfest/hallows end items are just iLevel upgrades of previous existing items (that have been iLevel upgraded before) hardly makes it a waste of time. Hell, just getting people to THINK that Pandaria is coming sooner than later is already worth the 2 minute number tweak effort on their part. :</div></div><hr />

Sigh...<br />
<br />
Than I guess MoP can come before the gamescom then?<br />
So the game wouldn't have this cinematic since it will be first seen at gamescom?<br />
<br />
This tells a lot of things, of which the most obvious should be that the release date is &gt; gamescom...</div></div><hr />

Yeah, because all other companies are completely uninterested in making money and showing positive results for their shareholders...-_-<br />

<br />
they already have which is why this game is failing and vivendi wants to drop actiblizz like used toilet paper<br />
<br />
there may still be a lot of players but they have a much larger support staff and infrastructure to upkeep so the game is barely turning a profit with all the fallout and D3 numbers have dropped significantly...the only thing that kept it ultimately successful at launch was riding the coattails of a previously successful game</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">antonatsis</div><div class="date">2012-06-30, 02:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">people you all speculate with random numbers and such....just take actuall numbers in consideration(and one kinda random factor{the ptr factor})<br />
<br />
IF we take that the cinematic will be showned before they anounce a release date,then the earliest they can bring the game oute will be 3 weeks<br />
<br />
this is because <br />
<br />
1st the pre-patch(the one that will make the transition to MoP mechanics)will last 2 weeks(as BLIZZ stated.This i read from people in the forum so i assume is true)<br />
<br />
2nd the earliest they can patch up is 1 week after the cinematic since they will show it on a friday and the patching is in wendsday<br />
<br />
So we have 3 weeks at best in order to have a launch of the game.For every wendsday that passes and the pre-patch isnt in we add 1 more week to the whole date expectation<br />
<br />
This is ofcourse assuming the pre-patch will be on the PTR in the next 45 days IF the pre-patch wont be in the PTR in the next 45 days then we add a 2 week extra in our speculation(i assume 2 weeks since i believe its a good amount of time to test a few things)<br />
<br />
So with a pre-patch on the PTR in the next 45 days we have a 4-5 of september release AT ITS BEST considering they will move ASAP after the cinematic<br />
Without the pre-patch in the PTR in the next 45 days we have a 19-20 of september release AT ITS BEST considering they will move ASAP after the cinematic<br />
<br />
For every week that they wont be adding the pre-patch in the PTR you add 1 more week to the above way of thinking.<br />
<br />
from the moment the pre patch will be in the PTR then the best possible release date will be 35 days after that</div></div><hr />

This means we'll have new content after the summer when everybody starts their studies or come from holydays and start working again. <br />
<br />
Also we'r with the same content and in my opinion DS is repetitive and boring. I'm in the side of people thinking that having heroic modes are bullshit and a different raid progression like the TBC is the way (and I did only Karazhan and Lady Vashj), yeah for sure lot of people will not see the end game but they can allways add a debuff if an atunement is meet or something else (this is their job not mine). <br />
<br />
This is just my opinion, don't blame me :(.<br />
<br />
The most I hate is first they said we will get expansions every year and was not achieved (ok, too much work np). With MoP I remember they said that the release date will not follow the same timeline like the others xpan. and will be released before. WTF this is looking the same way as TBC and WotLK.</div></div><hr />

MoP will not be released in Aug or Sept it will probably release around holiday time same as the rest except for the late BC arrival. To think it will release 3 weeks after the cinematic is retarded. Namely because they have to A. Announce the release date, so that B. the masses can upgrade to Collectors editions, and C. so they can close the CE option and wait another month or so before launch. This has been the trend since BC. Look for it from mid November to mid Christmas. Don't be surprised if it doesnt make it till Jan.</div></div><hr />

They could but I wouldnt hold my breath. Based on past expansions I would still say holiday time this year. You can deny it all you want but none of us know, and at least my speculated release time frame was based on past data.</div></div><hr />

... I don't think you understood what I was saying, but that's alright. I know what Gamescom is, and I wasn't saying it was entirely Blizz oriented.
