Are windwalker monks really supposed to have 30+ keybinds in warlords? I just counted the skills and the prunning did nothing to us<br />
They had the lowest number of active buttons in the game. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/518547754059317249))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
Are the normal 5-mans in the beta supposed to be incredibly difficult to do in heroic raid gear, or is it just me?<br />
Your gear is being scaled to the bare minimum for the zone. Which dungeon(s) did you find to be too challenging? (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/518930836142710784))<br />
<br />
Are the insanely long loot tables for dungeon bosses intended ?<br />
Personal loot in dungeons means every boss needs to have at least something for every spec. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/519226747082924032))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Why don't you guys make a PvP talent tree to a whole different one from PvE separated, so they don't interfere for more balance?<br />
We already do so many thing to tune the game separately. A second talent tree sounds like a complexity nightmare. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/518559025190174720))<br />

Reputation / Questing<br />
Does WoD have hidden/alternative quests that reveal themselves after having a convo between an npc?<br />
Quests are there to guide you, so we don't generally hide them. WoD has more &quot;discover-able&quot; content than any expac, though. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/518633542142525443))<br />
<br />
Does WoD give players choices that alter (at least slightly) the story while questing? Makes people pay attention to the story.<br />
The building you choose to construct at your garrison outpost in each zone can lead to different quests in some cases. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/518633846682554368))<br />
<br />
Do WoD have optional (or interactions) that are morally driven rather than reward driven? (Saving a person in a fire for nothing)<br />
We tend to create interactions that have a mechanical purpose (objective credit, buff) or add flavor. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/518635251568893952))<br />
If you save a person from a fire, we feel like we should reward you for that, in addition to you feeling morally good about it. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/518635353742143488))<br />
<br />
Is there any open-world non-raid reason to group in WoD? Do you think there should be? Is that supported gameplay?<br />
We have some group quests while leveling up, and several of the max-level outdoor areas are group content. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/518867353992691712))<br />
<br />
In Diablo 2 there are random shrines that spawn to add flavor to the gameplay. I always wondered why WoW doesn't have this...<br />
Timeless Isle had these! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/519184466406031361))<br />
Will we see any random shrines like these in Warlords?<br />
There are tons of useful buff items scattered around Draenor/endgame POIs, not shrines this round, different/new stuff (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/519192381531619330))<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
Is the barn supposed to make cooking obsolete or is this an oversight? Garrisons shouldn't be more important than the characters.<br />
Your shipments are limited, and not everyone will have the barn, how many feasts does your raid need? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/518554112724828161))<br />
<br />
Any chance we can Have prisoners of enemy factions in our garrison? i'd love to have gnome slaves and goblin overseers please <br />
This was going to be a feature of the barracks jail at one point, maybe we'll revisit it in the future with some fun questgivers (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/518554230672850944))<br />
<br />
some of us would rather have a &quot;collect them all&quot; than &quot;research which follower comes from where in advance&quot;<br />
You can see them in your follower list (uncollected followers show up as grey but searchable), but yes that is a concern. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/518937946612043777))<br />
<br />
What if we want to collect those other followers though!<br />
Considering ways to allow you to gain them in the future. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/519020478879789056))<br />

I made the same character in the beta and something looked weird, couldn't tell what, but now i see it - the old double moustache (if it makes sense to call it that...) got changed to a single one. It's a pretty big change imho, with no way to compensate by switching to another.<br />

You can't be serious. The old Night Elf model is completely different from the new. They look less mature, grizzled, feral and less muscular. They are supposed to be feral Night Elves of the forests and Blizzard have turned them into a joke. The new models have rounder features, wide eyes, plastic facial hair... The list goes on. <br />
<br />
They now look like... Dobby the house elf. Unbelievable.</div></div><hr />

Troll Females are more and more like a blue amazoness fighter with the new model.<br />
<br />
Still too much &quot;same-face&quot; on many races or that the diversity between faces of old models vs new models for most races have shrunk quite abit. Still think they need some more work and hopefully that they will do some fixes for them for when the Blood Elf models go live.</div></div><hr />

This is the dumbest criticism ever. Do I need to be a professional chef in order to have the opinion that food tastes bad?<br />

I think they're good for the most part but the female Gnome's absolutely absurd facial expressions have ruined her. As did the angry face. Doesn't sync up with her vocal emotes whatsoever.</div></div><hr />

I love the new orcs and trolls. I laughed my butt off, when I saw the facial expressions of male orcs. So dorky and sometimes stupid. But I like it. Blizz did a really good job on Tauren as well imo (though I understand, why some people think, that they are too cute atm.). The dwarves, undead, humans and gnomes are okay, with the exception of female knows having a hangover-look. I think, the NE lost certain features and are too cutsey as well. But this is WoW and everything is turning more comical since MoP. It's okay.<br />
<br />
My biggest problem are the Draenei. I will never grow to the overly big bug-eyes of the female Draenei and the male just seem puffed. I was like: &quot;Wow...he became fat...&quot;. The female draenei just creep me out...alot. When they first introduced the new model in &quot;Daughter of Argus&quot;, I really liked the model. It was close to the original and looked totally fine. But THIS is not, what I expected after seeing the artcraft for it. It kinda feels, like Blizz mixed the april fools draenei and the old arcraft model together and this is, what came out. Freakishly big, creepy eyes and a kinda bitchy look in every expression. Also, the difference between the original model of the draenei and the new one is especially noticable in the eyes section. If this is, what might happen to the BE as well, then Blizz is going to have a bad time. Though I have to admit, it looks alot better, when it is animated. :)<br />
<br />
But overall, I would switch the new models on, with the only expection being Draenei. If I had a choice, I would keep the old Draenei.</div></div><hr />

It was a toss up for me between that and night elf. Ended up choosing Draenei for the racial.

Then you picked the wrong race. Night Elves have been amazons since inception. You want lanky, frail, sickly, and image-obsessed? Roll a Blood Elf.</div></div><hr />

Some of the original faces have thin eyes, but on the new face theres only one that has those thin eyes.

<br />
+1 on that one.<br />
<br />
I think the new Night Elf (female) model is bad. The worst is the markings in my opinion since they do not have any shadings nor highlights! The old ones look soo much better! The new markings looks like they are still in alpha. The second worst thing is the hair. What have they done to our beautiful hair? Why is the long hair so thin at the top and then a thick ball of seaweed at the bottom? Like, really? The most beautiful night elf hair turned into the most gross one? It is natural that the further down the hair the thinner it is since you loose hair all the time and the hair furthest down is the oldest.<br />
<br />
I will not even go on to the faces but I think they actually do resemble the old faces somewhat. Although the old ones are better.<br />
<br />
I don't care about the /emotes. The most important thing is the face since that is what you will see when you look at your character and have the helmet not showing! Who wants an ugly face with goofy emotes? No one! Beautiful face with a bit milder emotes would be more appreciated.<br />
<br />
You ruined Night Elf! Grrrr!</div></div><hr />

Oh, this but the beginning, many are not going to like what happened to the game in general. We have yet to see the really stuff from the people that have not been paying attention all this time.

<br />
I actually paid very close attention while leveling through beta as I always have when even leveling an alt through the game. In many instances the various npc's in the game look better than the character remodels do. I find that amazing that they spent so much time on npc to put the detail in they have and not shown the same in regards to some of these actual player remodels. Some of these actually look more cartoony as you say then what they were to begin with. I think that is what many are trying to convey. I am glad at least the ones I play look very nice and I am pleased. At least going forward if I make anymore characters, I know which ones to stay away. What the did to the Night Elf male with the skinny waistline and those chiseled abs, along with those very long arms and huge hands. They very much lack proportional to its overall self. If these look this bad, I can't wait to see what they are doing the the Blood Elves.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormykitten</div><div class="date">2014-10-12, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some good some bad, but like was a common feedback early in the betas, the night elf is by far the worst remodel; it is far from what they should be and what they have been. For some reason they went from athletic body types to more dense,compact and angular, which makes absolutely no sense if you look back at how they have been portrayed. I think one reason for this uneven quality is that they tried very hard to make them look like the old models, but from scratch with new tech. It must be incredibly hard - i bet the results would have been easier to achieve if they didn't have to think about that.<br />
<br />
It's funny how perceptions change on the button bloat too. The very fact that monk now has a few more abilities than most is one of the best reasons for me to stick with it as main. :P I don't like sacrificing complexity just to reduce bloat - could have been done without removing gameplay mechanics.<br />
<br />
Finally, I am pumped for the expansion... with the above caveats.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly and this why people are having a problem other than just the features themselves. Blizzard did not do a very good job of conveying this early on and now that they are here the push back is only going to get worse, even though people can revert back to the older model, if they want. They should have done a better job of let people know that their character model was going to not look even close to what they use to be. I personally like many of them, at least they are updated, but for the person that does not see it my way. I can completely see it from their perspective as well and there is so much that has changed in this new content and many are not going to like what they see or do.<br />

I think they did a very good job of doing a lot of things to make the game feel fresh after 10 years, but many of those changes and there are a lot of them, are just going to turn a lot of people off. I think they went to far in some place with all this changing stuff. The game barely resembles itself in this new content. Change is good, but to much is a recipe for disaster. Without know what is coming in the coming patches, it is hard to determine how well this is going to go over with many. Like you said, time will tell.</div></div><hr />

Well they have been tall and athletic for almost 10 years, not thin like the blood elves, but they lost their proud and graceful posture, to name only two things. Also, the new models do not breathe, they sway like a drunk and have an asymetrical torso, not to mention, they all have the same flashlight eyes, the markings are much less refined than on the old model, they are all moon-faced now for some mysterious reason. The only thing that actually is more <br />
detailed on the new model is the underwear and maybe the hair texture.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you can see this in various animations such as the troll male sit in the classic model both hands were resting on his thighs so his shoulders were up and didnt have shoulder armor cut into his face, the new model has one arm on his thigh resting while he has his hand on one thigh in a more cocky type of look but the result has your entire shoulder armor cutting into his head .<br />
<br />
alot of the animations dont even pair up nicely with the movement speed of the character look at the dwarf walk animation for the males for instance it looks like your power walking, like your trying not to run but are in a rush to find a toilet .<br />
<br />
its sad that they have put so much PR into this artcraft series and have had legitimate complaints and concerns from people who play the game and want to keep the feel of their characters which is what blizzard has stated it was intent to keep alive yet ignored all the same.</div></div><hr />

To minimize the outrage, they could start by not making promises they don't intend to keep. Or avoid making deceiving statements.

Have you seen the female undead unitframe portrait for the new model? It was very nice before and now it's like weird angle and zoomed out. Feels weird to see a portrait from let's say a Tauren Male and then see Female Undead. Hope they change this (Male Draenei portrait at TBC launch also looked weird and they changed it not long after TBC launch so hopefully they can do it again)<br />

How is that even possible? I don't get it, especially, when they did really well on most of the models! Maybe, Blizz should have created models, that are NOT based on the original ones...the Gul'dan model came out so well...but they had creative freedom here. I wonder how things would have turned out, if Blizz had decided to come up with completely new models and just kept the basic trademarks, like skin colour and NE fangs, Draenei horns, troll tusks etc.</div></div><hr />

I dont think its the change people are complaining about. its the outright ugly and horrible proportions. Also murdering the characters we fell inlove with for 10 years. They have done really good jobs upgrading NPC's just seems like they missed the mark on most races. Oh well.</div></div><hr />

We have yet to see the really stuff from the people that have not been paying attention all this time. There is a ton of stuff people will be hitting Blizzard with once they level and get to the end and evaluate the leveling content, then it will move over to the PG, dungeon, and world content, garrison, squish, class purge and changes. All these things that have been debated over and over again by the people that been paying attention and even some of those have not been following twitter all this time. We are going to have more rounds of debate and sadness as to what Blizzard did to WoW. <br />
<br />
This expansion is like no other and so much change is not good for a game 10 years old. Once the masses really start getting into the game many are going simply hate it for what it has become. I for one am so looking forward to this debate happening, because Blizzard did not listen during beta and they are going to catch far more hell from this content, than any other combined. My friend, you think this bad, wait month or two. They really went to far in some areas and now they are going to here about. <br />
<br />
They were going to loose subs anyway due it being a 10 year old game, but they stand to loose a lot more for what they did to the game. Many will not like it and the will not cata 2.0 in many regards. Some much time devoted to the remodels and garrison and a lot of people don't like either for what they become.<br />
<br />
Your entire post could have been applied verbatim to every expac and major content release which made class/quest/interaction changes throughout the entirety of WoW's existence. Fact is, many people will simply call out any change, no matter how significant, and deride it simply because (1) they dislike change, (2) it is Blizzard, who is a target at all times, and (3) anonymous public forums encourage pundits to act like they have some significant POV that deserves their chosen communities immediate attention before the apocalypse ensues.<br />
<br />
I agree that some of the changes are of seeming less quality than other, and I agree people have the right to express their opinions over it. What I disagree with is the complete lack of faith people have in Blizzard to improve any glaring issues, as they have historically. So many of the people in this forum do not even play more, and just post based on the data here (or from friends that also do not play, or still do but hold a negative view of Blizz while doing do) that their opinions are no longer even valid criticisms, being that if it was the greatest work ever by Blizzard, they would *still* react negatively to it.<br />
<br />
Fact is, MoP was some of the best balanced and realized work of Blizzard in an expansion to date. BC was great for the hardcores, Wrath was great for luring casuals into the game (because it required zero skill to play), Cata gave us the ability to see all of the story content (which was great regardless of people opinions on LFR), and MOP gave us some of the best storytelling and content extending tech we have seen. While the jury will have to be out for at least 3-6 months for WoD (after the first content patch at least), I think it has the potential to achieve a balance between specs we haven't seen before, even better questing and storyline delivery, and system that separates casual access to endgame content from the reward system more capable players have been demanding, and yet another new game system (garrisons) whose integration into the overall player progression in the game will add additional depth and flavor.<br />
<br />
All-in-all, and especially in regards to players models, it's a lot of chicken little over (1) something that will impact gameplay exactly 0% (apologies to roleplayers, who *may* be impacted, but who can TONS of fodder for how alien abductions caused the changes), and (2) changes which virtually none of you know how they will play out until we have gotten into the game, and Blizz can see what we do differently and which sore spots are the most glaring. I have faith they will address the makor issues, because they always have (no matter what the eternal naysayers believe).</div></div><hr />

Because this community made tool being accurate and co-developed immediately informs the *sheep* of the community of what potential FOTM should be run with, instead of expecting people to play the classes they want, and getting raw data to make sure everything players close to equal. Beyond which, it also informs guilds looking to gain world first valuable insight into how they can stack their rosters and such, instead of expecting them to figure it out, leading to the group with the best research and skill to have the better chance, not the one who best studied simcraft before launch to get the best raid loadout day 1 minute 1.</div></div><hr />

It was hard, almost impossible actually. She had almost 1B health and the only thing that made pre-nerf Oondasta killable was that it was a World Boss, so people could ress and come back and hit her again.<br />

Yes, the NE male model appears very rushed, and I wish they'd give a hint as to when the BE models will be coming out. I do hope the BE models are nowhere near as rushed as the NE ones were, as they have no excuse for it.<br />

You can't be serious. The old Night Elf model is completely different from the new. They look less mature, grizzled, feral and less muscular. They are supposed to be feral Night Elves of the forests and Blizzard have turned them into a joke. The new models have rounder features, wide eyes, plastic facial hair... The list goes on. <br />
<br />
They now look like... Dobby the house elf. Unbelievable.<br />

Blizzard did not do a very good job of conveying this early on and now that they are here the push back is only going to get worse, even though people can revert back to the older model, if they want. They should have done a better job of let people know that their character model was going to not look even close to what they use to be. I personally like many of them, at least they are updated, but for the person that does not see it my way. I can completely see it from their perspective as well and there is so much that has changed in this new content and many are not going to like what they see or do.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />

<br />
<br />
I think they did a very good job of doing a lot of things to make the game feel fresh after 10 years, but many of those changes and there are a lot of them, are just going to turn a lot of people off. I think they went to far in some place with all this changing stuff. The game barely resembles itself in this new content. Change is good, but to much is a recipe for disaster. Without know what is coming in the coming patches, it is hard to determine how well this is going to go over with many. Like you said, time will tell.<br />
<br />
The problem is not novelty. I would welcome new models if they were well made. Some fan-made models are fantastic, e.g. some of the BE models that the person who apparently worked on the NE female models cooked up in his/her capacity as a fan are awesome (see here (http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/283/a/e/blood_elf__construction_shot__by_firstkeeper-d4cf6cj.jpg) and here (http://th09.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/f/2012/361/a/c/blood_elf_by_johnmcflurry-d5pcqyd.jpg)). So novelty here isn't the issue. It's that a lot of the remakes, at Blizzard's insistence, are similar to the old ones, but look a whole lot worse, albeit with higher polygon counts than before. And it isn't a case of &quot;stuffed if they do, stuffed if they don't&quot;. This expansion has no new races or classes, and this is largely to devote resources to the new models, and the garrisons. The new models aren't optional, in the sense that the game looks very dated, and without WoW 2.0 on the cards, they need to liven it up, particularly given how the newer races (Cata and after) leave the others in the dust. So this isn't some gift they're giving us, it is mandatory to keep up with MMO competition, which isn't going to decrease. Just look at FFXIV's gorgeous, very alive character models for what the competition is. They're also not realistic to the extent that they will age badly. So with all that said, I hope Blizzard will devote some serious effort into bringing parity for some of the models that were rushed.<br />
<br />
A good share of the models, e.g. the new human male, are very good. They're off in some ways, e.g. proportions could do with some fixing as fans have pointed out and things like body hair could be optional, but beyond this they are excellent. Then, others, like the draenei female and NE male are just terrible.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Graeham</div><div class="date">2014-10-12, 11:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard would do well to further polish and enhance the character customisation as we move forward. Some of the new models are pretty decent yet others are very lacking and appear to have drawn the short straw. Which isn't surprising given that a lot of content has been cut and rushed for release. Many players have put forth excellent questions and suggestions in regards to the new character models but Blizzard remain silent which doesn't really help to boost confidence.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zathrendar</div><div class="date">2014-10-12, 11:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well they have been tall and athletic for almost 10 years, not thin like the blood elves, but they lost their proud and graceful posture, to name only two things. Also, the new models do not breathe, they sway like a drunk and have an asymetrical torso, not to mention, they all have the same flashlight eyes, the markings are much less refined than on the old model, they are all moon-faced now for some mysterious reason. The only thing that actually is more <br />
detailed on the new model is the underwear and maybe the hair texture.<br />
<br />
Newsflash: blood elves are also supposed to be athletic. In the WRPG and other sources, when it comes to their stats, they're described with high agility and high proficiency with the bow and sword. They are particularly gifted in magic, but they share the athletic habits of their cousins. The female BE are very thin at present, it is true, but BE aren't necessarily &quot;thin&quot;, just because the TBC model for the females (or indeed, the aborted, horrible alpha model for the males) is. A look at their officially sanctioned concept alone can confirm as much.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
If you want the elegance and the graceful make her a belf...<br />
<br />
Yes, it is also meant to apply to NE, who are similarly described. The animations of the female NE have always been very graceful. The male NE looks goofy, but due to bad design rather than an intentional feature of a race with high agility...<br />

Like someone else above said, I was concerned with the new character model update until I saw the initial artcraft previews. They laid all my concerns to rest and made me forget all about it .. until I got beta access and logged in ... the models on the beta are absolutely horrible, pretty much every one of them. They are nothing like the preview models were (except maybe Draenei females and to be fair, I did not look over the Horde closely other than female undead, which was awful). <br />
<br />
I was going to take comparison pictures but kept forgetting, thankfully, MMO has posted them for us so we can easily see how wrong alot of these went. I, for one, am going to &quot;Disable New Character Models&quot; and never enable them, unless by some miracle, BLIZ redoes them all somewhere down the road and actually sticks with their original promise of: &quot;We want them to look exactly like the character you know and care about.&quot; <br />
<br />
There's no shortage of people complaining or asking why, for the new models as well as why alot of classes currently feel awful to play. But all of this feedback has brought upon no real responses, or changes. Sad days, BLIZZARD has always been alot better than this. I don't understand what's happened here.<br />
<br />
It's true, to an extent. I do think some of the models, like the human or orcish ones, are a lot better. Even animation wise, they move smoother than before. Human females still feel inelegant and clunky, but the lighting on the models and the textures are better than before. They do seem to have aped Wildstar's approach of childish, cartoonish expressions on the characters, which is somewhat in WoW's style, but the artcrafts as you say don't accurately reflect the way the models play out, which is a mixed success. It's not all bad, but there's a lot of work to be done, if this is to be an acceptable update to the models.<br />
<br />
I do think we'll see more, though, particularly once they begin work on the BE models. I do hope those receive their exclusive attention, so they're not rushed, but after that we should see some tweaks and updates, and perhaps even remakes, of the already done models, which require further work. Shapeshift forms are getting a remake, apparently, and I also hope spells like fireball and frost bolt are due for a spruce up, like Incinerate got.<br />
<br />
It may also be that the new models only look so good because the old ones were that bad, but credit is due to them for doing a very good job in some cases.</div></div><hr />

It's not just you all the male draenei look fugly, they didn't look that good before but now they look worse which I tought couldn't happen, but the female draenei and nelf are the biggest losers of the model update, they were among the best of the old races and now they both look terrible</div></div><hr />

This was my worry when I saw we'd be last :/ I don't think there have even been any changes to them since they were added to beta. I'm actually okay with how my new face looks, but the wider waist and narrower shoulders bother me, and the run. Ugh, the run.<br />

The one thing I cared about with the male night elf update was the possibility of finally having eyebrows with no beard, and guess what they didn't do? Put eyebrows on the face with no beard, so you still look like an idiot who doesn't know how a razor works and just ran it over your entire face. Also kind of mad that the casting animations are still garbage even though ppl have complained about male night elf casting animations for ages, but I can live with those.<br />

Once Blizzard start giving numbers, they know people will do their best to prove they are wrong , or to ask buffs, or to ask why they can't get the same numbers, and the conditions to obtain them, and &quot;Bliizard hate my spec, i knew it, we are officially last&quot; and whatever.</div></div><hr />

The first four faces are not that bad and they just need tweaking slightly, the last three and last two especially look as though the artist deliberately went &quot;Oh you don't like creepy smile? Then fuck you have a miserable wrist cutter gnome instead&quot;</div></div><hr />

A bunch of us have complained repeatedly on the forums, and Blizzard, with their usual arrogance, ignored the very people that have to SEE the characters day after day. They took what was (imho - and bear in mind I say this as a person who primarily plays Horde!) the cutest female race and made them cranky, exhausted and overall utterly unappealing looking. In the meantime, they made nearly all of the less attractive female classes (trolls - if you ignore the body warts, orcs, night elves) look significantly more attractive compared to their old models. If you can get over the eyebrows, human females are even generally more attractive. Why so much love there and so much hate to the gnome girls?<br />

Basic art: less details - more imaginations, bigger chance to be nice to our eyes. More details get this away from us, and we get more from the people who created those.<br />

<br />
And I just thought I might add some positive feedback too, although it's unfortunately not about the race I play. I think the female troll faces are totally outstanding! I am really jealous that the female night elf wasn't lucky enough to get a face as beautiful as that. The tauren upgrade looks amazing! So detailed! That look in the eyes and the fur, so soft and humble. The difference is phenomenal. The male troll is also really neat but I wonder why Blizzard always makes the colour darker? It is the same with Night elf hair, its so much darker and grey. (Just like male troll skin). Hmm.<br />
<br />
The male gnome has a nice set of funky faces, im pleased with those. The female gnome.. Well, I have one face I like. And I think it's weird that the bottom left face is turned into an angry one when the original isn't that upset at all.<br />

I'm disappointed only by a male draenei. I wrote about it earlier, when I saw new models for the first time. They doesn't look graceful and proud at all. Their faces now looks really like a space goat's. Even with so full of life emotions on them. And this hump at the back. They - was - my favourite race, before rework.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Night Elf male models look like....well, &quot;male models.&quot; Which would be fine, except several posters are right: Night Elves are forest people. The NE males are supposed to be grizzled, chiseled, with an appearance that looks like they just came from foraging in the woods, not like they just came from a hair salon, or from a workout session with The Situation. I don't have too much beef with the face, however, only because they did add some more lined options other than the rounder ones (even if there are only 1-2 that come close to the rough look the NE males should have). <br />
<br />
The work on the Draenei actually makes me excited to see what will happen with the Blood Elves, apart from the female faces. The Draenei female faces are so off and on it's ludicrous. Sometimes they look like they are similar to the old model, and other times it looks like two entirely different people (even if it is supposed to be the same face as the old version). <br />
<br />
Now BLOOD ELVES are the ones that are supposed to look like models. The BE men and women are the ones that are supposed to look like they came from a nail/hair salon, or from a workout session with The Situation. If the BE females are pumped up and muscular, and the BE males are too grizzled, it will almost be like the dev team went schizo during this development cycle. If they look similar to the NE men and women (minus the musculature of the women), it will be a success. <br />
<br />
The rest are hit and miss. The Trolls got a huge upgrade, imo (at least the females). The male gnomes look fine, while the female gnomes look like they're perpetually pissed for some reason. Both male and female Tauren look good, as well. <br />
<br />
Overall, not too shabby. I certainly don't see anything I couldn't live with -- though since the majority of my toons are BE, I imagine I'll have a much clearer perspective when they implement them in a future patch. <br />
<br />
Just don't screw it up. Humans, Blood Elves and Night Elves -- in that order -- are the races that you absolutely CANNOT afford to screw up. They are the most played races -- again, in that order -- and so far there are things to like and dislike about all of the ones that have been released from that group. <br />
<br />
I'mma just cross my fingers and hope for the best on the Blood Elves.</div></div><hr />

a lot of the female faces look absolutely nothing like the original. it's really obvious they do not understand what made certain faces look the way they do--but i guess that's what happens when you have an all-male art team! hurp. the hetero male &quot;here's my personal standards for beauty&quot; is impossible to get past, sorry.<br />

also, who configured the male drae's idle pose? seriously. those arms are fucked up; male night elf as well, to a lesser extent. why are their arms locked so tight? the 3/4ths angle of the drae male looks like a warner brothers &quot;scared to death&quot; animation. i'm expecting the next frames involve the color draining out of his body, followed by falling over stiff as a board.<br />
