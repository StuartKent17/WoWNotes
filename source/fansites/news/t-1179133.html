<br />
All Races Available in Patch 5.0.4<br />
With the release of patch 5.0.4, we’re making all the races of Azeroth playable by anyone, no matter which version or expansion of World of Warcraft they own. This includes the enigmatic pandaren, who will become available for play when Mists of Pandaria is released on Tuesday, September 25. We want the entire World of Warcraft community to be able to embrace their inner goblin, blood elf, worgen, draenei, or pandaren from the moment they step foot into the world of Azeroth.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/august/thumb/0LO1Y1NVRLXN1345075155085.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/august/0LO1Y1NVRLXN1345075155085.jpg) <br />
<br />
Now, the only hard part will be choosing a name. Who will you be next?<br />
<br />
<br />
I've seen some confusion about when pandaren character creation will be accessible.<br />
<br />
Just to be clear on the announcement, we're making it possible for people to create a character of any race, regardless of what expansions you've purchased. So if you only have the original game (which now has The Burning Crusade included), when patch 5.0.4 hits you'll be able to create goblin and worgen characters as well. And, once Mists of Pandaria is released, you'll be able to create pandaren characters, regardless of whether or not you own Mists of Pandaria.<br />
<br />
So it says all races, what about though all classes? Just because Pandaren become available for play regardless if you have MoP or not, does this include the new monk class?<br />
No, you'll need to upgrade your World of Warcraft license to Mists of Pandaria in order to unlock the monk class. The same is true for leveling from 85-90 and gaining access to the continent of Pandaria.</div></div><hr />

People will still have to buy the xpacs to level, but you're not forcing them to roll a &quot;Lame&quot; (For lack of a better term, they simply may not like anything bar worgen or Blood Elf!) race. <br />

<br />
Currently, you have to buy Cata to make a Worgen or Goblin. After the patch, anyone will be able to make a Worgen or Goblin, even if they don't have Cata.<br />
<br />
Pandaren will also be available for everyone, but only after MoP has launched in September.<br />
<br />
This isn't adding new race/class combinations and isn't saying that you can create non-Monk Pandaren before MoP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BC was given for free to anyone who did not already have it right around the time Cata came out. Anyone that buys WoW now also gets BC automatically. So really all they are doing is giving everyone free access to Goblin, Worgen, and Pandaren.</div></div><hr />

Seeing as GW2 is F2P and WoW is P2P..what's stopping you from playing both other then the mentality of &quot;I CAN ONLY PLAY ONE GAME AND IT IS BEST GAME OVER OTHERS&quot;. Not like you'll have end game raids in GW2 to draw you away from doing stuff in WoW that you enjoy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What they mean is: you don't need to own the Mists of Pandaria expansion to play the Pandaren race, but you'll have to wait till that expansion actually launches to actually do so in the case for Pandaren.<br />
<br />
What that means in general, though, is that people who just buy the basic WoW game access (ie, most new players) won't be limited to which races they want to play just because they didn't purchase the expansions yet.<br />
<br />
And honestly, it's a great idea considering how many expansions there are to WoW now; it's best that they start to learn from Everquest's mistakes when they started having many many MANY expansions. Making more of the new features baseline to new standard accounts makes getting started into the game a less daunting task in regards to 'oh shit now I have to buy 2 more things just so I can play this main game, what the hell'.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deadraline</div><div class="date">2012-08-16, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think this is cool. Most people are already caught up as far as expansions are concerned...but this will be nice for new players who only invested in vanilla/bc so they can at least play the race they were most interested in. :) <br />
<br />
But I also think this gives players a chance to play the pandaren and see what they are all about (regardless of being able to play the monk class or not) and get a feel for the race themselves. So many people assume the worst out of the race and this is a chance for those players to get to be hands on with them and really try them out before deciding to invest in MoP or not. :) I think it's a win win for both sides. Blizz will win some over with the pandaren I am sure...and I am sure some people will at least get a chance to say Well now I know even if it means they un-sub and go elsewhere. It's a good way for both sides to be happy and I think many will find they enjoy the pandaren as a race...or at least find them more tolerable than they originally thought. <br />
<br />
Looking forward to it (even though I am already planning to buy MoP on release day...).</div></div><hr />

It includes Pandaren after Sep 25th. It is interesting that you would be able to buy Vanilla/BC, then roll a Pandaren, and do the Pandaren starting quests on the turtle. Im guessing you cant be a DK w/o Wrath or a monk w/o MoP though.</div></div><hr />

BC is now part of vanilla, they dont sell it seperate anymore since they merged it digitally and in stores. Technically there are now 3 expansions. Wotlk, Cata and MoP.<br />

I think what this means is:<br />
<br />
&quot;If you are fully upgraded to Cata, and later MoP, this announcement is useless and means nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't know anyone who doesn't have a fully upgraded account. Such players are of no account to me as they cannot contribute to endgame in any fashion. I'm glad that Blizzard values them, but this announcement isn't clearly aimed at just them, and I think that's what it means.</div></div><hr />

Calling the new xpac &quot;kung fu panda&quot; how fresh and original, and completely supported by facts....<br />
<br />
Seriously, if you do not like the new xpac no one is forcing you to buy it, play it, watch videos of it, read sites that have news about it and so on. Since you where able to navigate to this site, I assume you are able to navigate to other sites of interest, maybe GW2?</div></div><hr />

New talents, account wide mounts and pets, class and encounter rebalancing, Racial unlock for those not upgraded to expansion level accounts, glyph and other system changes, etc. Theramore may not be released on August 28th and might unlock 1-2 weeks later as pre-expansion events tend to have stages to them.</div></div><hr />

People are happy to see a positive new change, and YOUR panties are in a very tight bunch? Common, you can't be serious with that attitude...<br />
<br />
Time and again people have voiced their concerns about people having to upgrade to the latest expansion to pick a race they really want, instead of buying the first part, jumping in, play and then decide to upgrade. This change is aimed to anyone wanting to start playing WoW. If you think that's 15 people, then the joke's on you.</div></div><hr />

The real aim of this is to allow people to come back and roll a goblin, Worg or Panda(after sept 25) without having to buy cata or Mop yet. basically expansions are mostly for raising your level cap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No you wait til the 25th of september. Read the article. It says you can play any race regardless of which expansion you own. MoP is technically not released therefore it doesn't technically become an ownable expansion until september 25th. Meaning if you have only vanilla...you can play a blood elf or draenei because Burning Crusade is an ownable expansion come patch 5.0.4. You can play a goblin or worgen because Cataclysm is an ownable expansion as of 5.0.4. However, because MoP is NOT an ownable expansion until september 25th...that means that patch 5.0.4 will be released august 28th. It is releasing all past as well as FUTURE restrictions on race choices for expansions regardless of which you own. So since MoP is released on september 25th that is when patch 5.0.4 will have its technical effect on the pandaren because they will be considered an ownable expansion on that day. <br />
<br />
Reading is a two step process. First, read the statement...second comprehend the meaning of the statement and think about it in a logical way. People are going to end up freaking out and complaining because blizzard probably didn't word it very clearly to some because they wanted to make it a short and to the point post...partially a mistake on their part for not making it easier to understand...but at the same time the reader should also be aware that MoP isn't being released on August 28th but rather september 25th and therefore it's technically not an expansion as of yet. :) I just hate it when people freak out screaming blizzard lied blizzard lied when it is simply written in a way that you need to stop and think and not get ahead of yourself and get all excited over something that isn't promised only to be disappointed when it doesn't happen. <br />
<br />
Hopefully this post will clarify some things for people so they understand now what blizzard meant. And I don't mean to sound like a prick...because I am not intending to be one. I just hate to see people get all excited and start preparing for something that just isn't going to happen as soon as they would like. I wish I could play a panda too...but it just won't be the case because well...MoP technically isn't an expansion until it is released. If blizzard wanted to they could scrap the whole project and never release MoP. (And I highly doubt that would happen but you never know!)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is a good move by Blizzard, and I could see this leading to them putting together an updated wow battlechest-type collection that includes vanilla and all expansions at least through cata to help make things simpler for new players. I know if I was new to wow and had to go up to the sales counter with 5 boxes (vanilla and the 4 exp now including mop) I'd probably have to think twice about the game and wonder wth I was getting myself into...</div></div><hr />

Where this works best: with RAF. You can now RAF-triple XP worgens and goblins (and pandarens) from their starting zone without purchasing all the X-Pacs on the RAF account.<br />

<br />
With the release of patch 5.0.4 you can make a character of any race no matter which expansions you have, except Pandaren because Mists of Pandaria will not be released yet. Once Mists of Pandaria releases, you can make a Pandaren character even if you have not purchased MoP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sorry you came to that conclusion, but this change is specifically for new players and those that haven't upgraded to Cataclysm yet. Of course it will also help players who haven't purchased future expansions as well to try out the newer races, but to say that this change isn't for new players is a bit off. I also really thinks its far too early for you to say &quot;mop dont sell as good as they want&quot; when we're more than a month away from the game even releasing. Blizzard is simply trying to make the game experience better for everyone. Why do so many people try and find negatives in every little thing they do?</div></div><hr />

Actually I think you will be able to do class combos without cata. In terms of like an undead hunter. Because they released new class combos before cata was even released in a patch. I remember playing a troll druid and leveling in the &quot;revamped&quot; zones before cata. Patch 4.0.3 came live on November 16th. That was the patch that included new class/race combos. Cataclysm was released December 7th. So people will be able to play any race/class combos because of that patch...but DK's and monks will require the appropriate expansions before they are available for play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is exactly what they should do. I'd wager a major reason net subs have been dropping is that all these expansions are making it progressively more expensive and complicated for a new player to get started. Fewer new subs coming in than old subs leaving means decline.<br />
<br />
The low level experience needs to be enticing enough to get new players to stick around. Making all races available regardless of owning their respective expansions helps a lot in that regard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm confused on this part... &quot;Includes Pandaren&quot;?<br />
<br />
It is not that difficult. On Sept 25th, if you do not buy MoP, you will still be able to create a Panda. Goblin and Worgs will be available on August 28th for people who do not have Cata.<br />
<br />
Also, some people have mentioned blood elves and dranai.. but I am pretty sure they are already available to everyone since BC has already been merged with vanilla.</div></div><hr />

Well now, I stand corrected. :)<br />
<br />
I wonder how long before Blizzard decides to roll Wrath into the Vanilla package. Also, if TBC is now considered part of Vanilla, can Blizzard finally integrate the Draenei and Belf starter areas and Ghostlands into Azeroth proper so we don't have to zone back and forth via portal and we can finally get flying in Exodar and Silvermoon City?</div></div><hr />

Then I realize, this is just a coding fix for them. &quot;Ok, now we don't have to worry about preventing the unupgraded guys from creating stuff.&quot;<br />

<br />
Fear not, BC content will be revamped in the next expansion when we go to Argus and again face the Burning Legion. As far as being redundant, consider that the Burning Crusade expansion is 5 years old. This is just their way of folding everything into the base game. Pretty much every game does that to remove the barrier to new people joining the game. Besides, pretty much the only way a new player gets the base game nowadays is the WoW Battle Chest.</div></div><hr />

No, you can't. Read again what they wrote.<br />
<br />
They simply state that if you have a - as an example trial account - you can make a pandaren when MoP launches. Or an expansion exclusive race like Goblin or Worgen the day 5.0.4 hits. This does not effect Cataclysm owners at all until release. Once MoP hits, even if you don't buy MoP as upgrade, you'll still be able to make pandaren (though maybe not Monk) even without the upgrade.</div></div><hr />

as for another clarification:<br />
<br />
Vanilla account - can play every race* except for classes like DK/Monk<br />
TBC - same as vanilla<br />
WOTLK- same as vanilla + DK*<br />
Cata- Same as WOTLK <br />
MoP- Same as WOTLK + Monk*<br />

*When MoP is released, you can have a pandaren up to the level of Expansion you have. <br />
2 Classes are Expansion Purchase - Bound. <br />
Races are Expansion RELEASE bound. <br />

I suppose the class restrictions depend on which expansion you've bought; ie. if you don't own WotLK, you won't be able to make a DK.<br />
<br />
What I'd like to know tho is whether we can get all the starter zones for all those races without buying any of the expansions; it seems like this is indeed what we're getting..</div></div><hr />

<br />
So this change basically allow you to create any race if you only have the original game without expansions, and no need for BC to unlock blood elves/dranei and Cata to unlock worgen/goblins from the character creation screen.<br />
<br />
Of course I read it wrong and I thought I could race change to pandaren on the 28th.. had to read it more than once lol.<br />

I am guessing they will allow people to do the pandaren starting zone with the trial account with this move.. otherwise nobody could play pandarens.</div></div><hr />

Time and again people have voiced their concerns about people having to upgrade to the latest expansion to pick a race they really want, instead of buying the first part, jumping in, play and then decide to upgrade. This change is aimed to anyone wanting to start playing WoW. If you think that's 15 people, then the joke's on you.<br />

No. You seriously don't get it after reading the blue post and all the comments? You can play as a Pandaren on September 25'th, and you will be able to whenever no matter what expansion you have, even if you only own vanilla with no expansions. You can now play ANY race, regardless of whether or not you own anything past vanilla. But the Pandaren go live on September 25'th.

No, you have to wait for MoP to come out in September. Read more carefully.</div></div><hr />

As catalystical said, Starter Accounts for new players. But also RAF accounts, as you don't get any benefit after 80. So now if you have your own RAF account you can dual-level Worgen, Goblins, or Panda while only paying for up to WotLK on the new account.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure Blizzard will get on that once I get compensated for the last three, obselete PCs I bought over the last 15 years.<br />

very true, blizzard will be throwing everything they can now that a f2p game thats just being released and already better than pandacraft is just around the corner.

...which naturally will not work, because thanks to your insightful post, the world has now their third eye opened and squee-geed clean. And we all shall flock away from ze evul Blizzard and only buy mature games from fair companies with impeccable ethos who do not want our money at all.<br />
<br />
Oh..newsflash: As a MMO player, the rest of the world considers us geeky pimply nerds who lives in mom's basement anyhow. Good for you that you chose to play a &quot;mature&quot; geeky nerd game and not a &quot;kiddy&quot; geeky nerd game.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure the 85-90 experience is just a small part of why someone would buy the expansion.</div></div><hr />

I don't think that will work, because the pandas have new, high polygon models. Putting their hairstyles on the old models would look really weird.<br />
<br />
I don't like it...it means trials can be panda = more crowded on starter isle :(<br />
MoP will have instanced cross-realm zones. It helps to populate low-pop zones, but it works the other way around too: makes crowded zones less populated :)</div></div><hr />

It can be seen that way true but there is a ton of stuff to farm out, If you want achievements (Dungeons,Reputations, Raids) Transmogrification gears (there are quite a few nice sets and models native only to Outland) Battle Pets and Mounts (Still a bunch of mounts you can only get from Outland including rare drops) Dare I say RPers for instance my Hearth is in Shatt even at 85 and I am not the only one, There is still much fun to be had and much collecting to do in Outland as well as Northrend despite the level difference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, only going off the info you've posted here, I'm still not seeing the problem? So it's level 58-70 content? And? The game's cap is 90 now. It's redundant. You want them to build a shrine to it? Oh wait, they sort of did by giving it an entire world dedicated to it full of interesting story, dungeons and an incredible amount of reps to grind and mounts to collect, not to mention unique gear that's still obtainable today.<br />

No because I read what it said - quite clearly says Races, not Classes or all Classes in Races - It says all races lol How could you possible read 'for all classes' added in there ^^<br />
