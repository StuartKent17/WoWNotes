And now the Leather_ArgentHorde armor models, please keep in mind that Blizzard didn't confirm that they will be the Tier 9 models ... But they could be. <br />

Patch 3.2 Raid Lockout Extension<br />
A new feature has been introduced in this build, you can now extend your raid lockout to make them last one more week. This is probably very useful if your guild is trying to get a specific boss down and doesn't really need any other loot in the instance, you can just get one more weeks of tries without having to clean everything in the way.<br />

The leader can be ass and extend their xy-whatever lockout for another week just to fuck them up.<br />
On the other hand it would be enough if the extension only works for the leader.</div></div><hr />

<br />
^^ This. While the lockout extension is pretty cool, there MUST be an option for a player to decide to drop their lockout after one week has passed. Certainly not before, however, as that would be allowing a player to reset a raid.</div></div><hr />

It probably only means the leader is extended, not you. If that were true I wouldnt PuG at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But only Sets with ilvl232 an 245 the really big one requires this regalia-thing.<br />
<br />
Rogues an druids with the same design is really interesting...maybe they introduce special sets for every spec. this druiddesign could probably be the feralset...would explain why pally, dk and warrior have the same (maybe tank)design...so there would be another one for plate-dps.<br />
would be very cool imo, just look at a player and &quot;oh here's a tank&quot;</div></div><hr />

don't know if I understood what you meant, but chest &amp; legs for example is worth more than bracers.. just because of stats (more stats = more worth)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
as to the sets, i dont think its tier. blizz does a very basic 3 sets an xpac. unless they are trying to go for what people forced them to do in BC, i suppose these are just going to be matching sets, not tier gear.</div></div><hr />

Making the sets look similar across armor classes is a clear strategy by Blizzard, as is opening up T9 to non-raiders (albeit in a nerfed form compared to the raid drops which is also a good thing). We're gearing up for the march on Icecrown. <br />
<br />
Like it or hate it, the Argent Crusade is leading this march, and they want their troops geared up for it, which is what T9 is all about. It's about turning the Horde and the Alliance into armies, with the identical uniforms (provided by the Crusade) that this implies. When I think of where this is headed I think of the battle of Helm's Deep or Minas Tirith in reverse, but with 2 armies of good guys dressed in military uniforms marching on Icecrown for the final assault on the Lich King. I know we'll never get that actual large-scale battle, but I like the way these changes are building towards that kind of imagery.<br />

I never thought about it like that. Hell, that's a damn near reasonable lore-based reason for having the new epic gear literally crammed down our throats like this.<br />

<br />
<br />
The extension will most likely be individual. For example, if no one else except you decides to extend (even if you're not leader), you will still be saved and everyone else removes the lockout, if you then invite those and they enter the instance, they will be saved again.</div></div><hr />

Problem is that with the ability to buy all tier pieces with the triumph emblems, you're already going to see noobs in full t9.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps only the final boss or two will actually drop the tokens... but that's probably hoping for too much.<br />
<br />
And it's probably for Live too, seeing as you can make a fully-geared out premade character anyways.</div></div><hr />

That's wrong, you cannot buy ALL Sets with Badge of Triumph...only ilevel232 and 245. The really big set with ilevel 254 still requires tokens from instance bosses.<br />
232 and 245 are like 10 man and 10hero/25norm-Sets... 254 is 25 hero...my guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
true, but provided you need like 300 emblems for whole set, you will need 100 days (if you are doing daily HC only). It depends how many emblems you gonna get from new instance ( if 5man will drop new emblem) and the easiest raid bosses. It may be like 50-60 days for noobs to get their T9 without experiencing the real encounters but it is 6-7 weeks so I can live with that. In 6-7 weeks most raiders in my guild will have few 250+lvl items anyway.</div></div><hr />

^^ This. In general, the forums are forgetting that we have a month or two before this goes live, and then another couple months at the least before bads could manage to pug their way to 250+ gear. By that time, Icecrown will be coming up and no one will much care anymore, I imagine.<br />
<br />
My biggest worry about the new order of things is that I see very little reason to do Ulduar after this patch...then again, the one-month lockout before all of 3.2's raid is even accessible will probably help to make it a relatively smooth transition.</div></div><hr />

So, how about I call you a &quot;casual&quot; reader, or a man with a &quot;casual&quot; attention span? Can you not see that the highest ilv needs tokens? We can assume that this is the tier9 set and it drops of bosses in RAIIIIIDS!!!!.<br />
<br />
Everything below is possibly T8 and 8.5 and by the time I wear my T9, I do not care that you have run heroics until you are blue in the face for your T8.5. And you know why? I am already in T 8.5 for the last 3 weeks, because I am just an awesome guy like that in an awesome raidgroup that can actually awesomely kill bosses.<br />
<br />
And any underperformer will never join our raids, be it in T8, T9 or T100...because...skillZ, baby, skillZ ^^</div></div><hr />

Well the gear should be reward for doing sth, for killing bosses, for mastering your own class and games mechanics. Now it will reward nolife farmers and kids without brain and parents who let them play 15 hours a day just because they want to have time for themself. <br />
<br />
It's like with everything in life. You work, you are good at it, get promoted, buy fancy car, bigger house etc. Lets say now every begger, who haven't learned for the whole life, haven't work can get car like yours for free. I know it is just a game, but still imo it should reward ppl who are good at it, not any rtard that pays month fee. We are going to be f.... lemmings, all with the same gear, the same spec ( yeah cause they f... this up as well - now warlock that wants to be top dps i.e. wants to raid and has good gear has to be 0/13/58 or 58/0/13, all other builds are not viable) the same gems. The only thing now that is going to be different are mounts ( Yuppi... look I have different mount than you, yeah isn't it awesome). I thought that in MMORPG's the game allows ppl to be different, to customize. Maybe in patch 3.3 they will make one tier model for each class and in 3.4 or 4.0 they will make only one, hybrid class without trees, all new players will start @lvl 80 with epic mounts and tier set in their mailbox. Lets go further, make one HORDALLIANCE fraction!<br />
<br />
About achievements - you can die in first 5 sec, lay down the whole fight doing nothing and you still gonna get it, now you would be kicked asap with no rolling possibility, in 3.2 you won't give a damn, you will get achievement and buy loot for emblems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- More bads who can't pve.<br />
- Under-tuned, over-nerfed instances.<br />
- Screwing with the progression of decent casual raiding guilds.<br />

Are you seriously saying it's acceptable to farm ilevel 245 gear, albeit slowly, from heroics that can be tanked by a hunter's pet?<br />

<br />
You can get full T9/T9.5 in a couple of weeks/month, it will take you months and months to farm the equivalent badges for it just doing the daily heroics.<br />
<br />
Personally, the easy way is to do the raid, the hard way would be do farm the heroics day in, day out. That's the way I see it anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
And honestly, who cares if people are walking around in T9 gear? I sure as hell don't. It doesn't detract from my experience of the game, and it won't detract from yours. Tier 7/7.5 being purchasable from vendors through heroism/valorous badges no one complains about. Every raid in WotLK is brain dead easy too (ignoring the hard modes), so don't even bother trying to argue that point. <br />
<br />
This change will help people who get stuck in a rut of not being in a hardcore raiding guild and can't advance their gear.<br />
<br />
It's like in Vanilla, guilds only wanted geared people, and the only way to get geared was to be in guilds that raided. It was a loophole for people who didn't have the gear. It wasn't their fault because they're 'bad'.</div></div><hr />

Nope, I've read this thread, and many others like it, the whole way through. I've just reached my tolerance threshold, and arguments about the pros and cons of resetting gear are missing the point.<br />

<br />
However, a large part of the game is pve and I am sick to the back teeth of wasting my time (be it in heroics, raids, whatever) with people who cannot play. By removing the incentive to join raiding guilds, Blizzard is further undermining the player base able to do so.

They forcing everyone to look the same - there are 3-4 non tier items that can equal tier items but still, you need 4pc bonus. The sets will look the same no matter what lvl they are so everyone on the server literally everyone in each class will look the same (but for feral druids and pvp players) or 90% alike. Will blizzard invite more ppl to buy WoW with this changes? I would rather say that they will make more ppl leave cause it will be no fun at all. <br />
<br />
I have a theory. They are making this changes to actually make WoW less enjoyable and by that prepare all of us for the new MMORPG by Blizzard which will have all our suggestions implemented from the very beggining making it the best game in history, so that they will break new record of the number of accounts.</div></div><hr />

First of all, 105 days is a LONG TIME. 3 months is practically an entire PvP season.<br />
<br />
There's still an incentive for people to actually run the raid instances themselves, since it drastically reduces the time to assemble all those Emblems and rewards you with drops for slots that the Emblems cannot provide for, most importantly your weapons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, a guild, even a casual raiding one, that takes itself with any sort of honesty, should really vet its players. If they're doing badly, then the guild needs to tell them to shape up, and help them learn how to play their classes properly. If a player cannot do that, then they should be removed from the guild. It's as simple as that.<br />
<br />
There will ALWAYS be bad players. Making the tier gear available in this way will neither increase nor decrease the number of bad players. It's pretty easy to spot one, too, what with the terribad enchants (or no enchants at all), terrible gear choices and gemming, pitiful dps/tps/heals... bad players will always be there. Avoid them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll get the gear by killing the raid bosses, and it's hard to waste time in a PuG when I don't PuG, ever. You, on the other hand, will probably be wiping on the first boss in your stupid PuG, then give up and go back to Naxx like the scrub you are.<br />

<br />
But this is the point... where is the incentive to become a good player, to learn how to raid? Naxx was supposed to be the entry-level instance in WoTLK. It won't be any more! A newly-dinged level 80 will skip it because they can get better gear through farming joke heroics.<br />
<br />
OFC a guild can implement it's own rules regarding performance when it comes to initiates, what I'm saying is that it will make it harder for guilds to recruit good players.<br />

Also, I wish people would stop banging on about the elitest/epeen thing. I don't give two tosses how a player gets their gear, what I do give a damn about is how many players there are who can actually use it.</div></div><hr />

So, let's consider that new content is released every 3 months. <br />
You need to connect 100 days to get everything. See a problem here ? <br />
Now, let's define a &quot;casual&quot; : is someone playing more than 3 days a week a casual ? (and even 3 days is a lot, imo, because you could probably find a decent raiding guild with this kind of attendance). <br />
So to get your main stuffed, you need something like 40 weeks at least (10 months) if you're doing only dailies.<br />
<br />
ZOMG ! that's totally unbearable !</div></div><hr />

If they're doing badly, then the guild needs to tell them to shape up, and help them learn how to play their classes properly. If a player cannot do that, then they should be removed from the guild. It's as simple as that.<br />
<br />
There will ALWAYS be bad players. Making the tier gear available in this way will neither increase nor decrease the number of bad players. It's pretty easy to spot one, too, what with the terribad enchants (or no enchants at all), terrible gear choices and gemming, pitiful dps/tps/heals... bad players will always be there. Avoid them.<br />

<br />
You as well as many others miss the point. You should only be able to aquire a specific level of gear by defeating the required difficulty of the specific boss. Raiding isnt done for gear, its done for FUN, gear is a REWARD for being skilled enough to complete a task. Why are we now rewarding people who cannot complete the tasks required to get higher levels of gear, with said gear? The fact that anyone can get the same gear as a raider simply by doing a heroic is absolutely insane. The whole point of a MMO is that those who spend more time, and are more skilled have access to new and better things, wow is trying to allow everyone to do/have everything so they can keep making more and more money.<br />
<br />
<br />
Im ok with VoA as it is, only dropping a few pieces of a specific set is nice, as people who raid can get pvp gear, and vice versa. However allowing people to obtain ANY piece of tier 8.5 and 9.whatever simply by hitting level 80 and walking into heroic VH in blues... is just wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly. That's a great point.<br />
<br />
We'll be the ones exploring new content. Call me crazy, but I love the feeling of going into a new raid with your guild, all unaware of what's going to happen. And I love wiping and wiping until finally you down that pain-in-the-ass boss. We'll be the ones playing these awesome encounters, and not the ones doing heroic Nexus hundreds of times.<br />
<br />
Loot is just a tool to get to the next boss/raid, I wouldn't care if they were grey items.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm lucky I'm in a good guild and we raid pretty frequently. Some others can't spend that sort of time to the game, so over a long period of time, they will be able to advance their character. Sad thing is, that even with full T9.5 all they'll be doing is heroics still. I actually feel sorry for these players.</div></div><hr />

Wow, that reply was completely unwarranted. Good job.<br />
<br />
Re: Tokens. A unified token for all pieces is an unnecessary convenience. Doesn't change the fact that novice players will not take the time to find the best piece for their current gear set, as opposed to going for the coolest looking/most PURPLEX piece possible.<br />
<br />
Badges, I'm over it. Whatever. In the end, it still benefits me and my guild and bad players will still be bad. I'll still outdps by a mile another mage in nearly equivalent gear who DIDN'T TAKE TORMENT THE WEAK AND IS NOT FFB SPEC (True story from last night no less!). That will make me slap my forehead harder than them getting a T9 piece I don't have yet.<br />

Re: Raid Timer Extensions. This has to be handled very carefully or it will be abused. Established guilds will love it, PUGs will get tortured. Will only work if the raid leader can extend the timer in the zone being extended. Even then, a dick PUG RL can bone an entire raid by slapping the extender even with the raid finished and screwing everyone else for another week. Very treacherous waters they've getting into here. <br />
<br />
However, my guild, which has seen its raid days cut from 3 days to 2 days due to low turnouts will love this change. As it is, even if we run screaming through Uld25, we still can only get an hour or two on new bosses and in the end, it's likely that when we have the rest of the Keepers down, we've have less than a half hour for Vezax weekly (good thing he's easy, at least on 10). <br />
<br />
And forget about FL+towers. With only six hours of progress raiding, we can't waste the time to knock down towers which sets us back considerably on guild progress sites. An extension means we can fart around and try FL+2 or 3 without worrying about losing tier drops due to time using Uld as an example</div></div><hr />

<br />
Casual players want to be able to get the same gear, and are willing to earn the reward the same as raiders do.<br />
<br />
Imagine the following equation<br />
Reward = Time x Effort<br />
<br />
Raiders put in alot of effort, and get their rewards in shorter time (calendar days, not work hours)<br />
Casuals put in less effort (doing 5-mans only) but put in alot more calendar time before seeing the reward.<br />
<br />
Raiders have access to everything the casuals already have, they can do the 5-mans and on top of that attend raids. Thus the raider can expect to get thir new tier9 in a fraction of the time a casual will get it in.<br />
<br />
You won't see casuals &quot;walking about in full tier 9&quot; in the first weeks of the patch. Also, raiders will probably be receiving badges from the bosses they defeat in the colluseum (on top of armour tokens) if they are doing the hard-mode 25-man version.<br />
<br />
So a raider will have badges fro mdailies, badges from instances (and I'm guessing that they'll get more than 3 (1 each from first 4 bosses, 2 from final *guess*) and tokens. So less QQ please as these casual gamers are never going to threathen your raid spot, becasue they don't want it, especially if they can get it through playing the way they want to.<br />
<br />
This will, in the long run, be a big benefit to raiding guilds, as there are often casual players who join up with a raiding guild for 1-2 months, then find out that they cannot support the raiding schedule and then drop out (typically/coincidentally when large amounts of wiping on hard-modes begins to surface) This ultimatly hamstrings the raiding guild's progress when they then have to recruit again to replace that person. This way casual players will have enough to keep them happy and won't see the need to join a raiding guild temporarily to get an injection of good gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I guess I'll never get is why non-raiders/&quot;scrubs&quot; (I refuse to call casuals, it doesn't mean less skilled players) badly want the top gear if they don't need it... even if it was for pvp, shouldn't they go for pvp gear instead? Just to sit in IF/Org showing it? That's even worse e-peen than a real &quot;hardcore e-peen&quot;.<br />
<br />
In fact, just non-raiders. &quot;Scrubs&quot; I can understand: want to raid, want purplelicious gear but they suck, don't get it and claim that they pay, so they should have it easy and everything in the game should be facerolling (or buff their class in pvp, nerf others, because they suck).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are these ratings based on all achievements? <br />
The largest slice of achievements are not linked to raids. Effectively the system will either allow casuals/pvpers to farm rep/pvp/dungeon completions for the points required for raid gear (which would be basically identical to the coming badge change) or raiders will be forced to farm rep/pvp/hug critters to afford gear they were previously earning by raiding.<br />
<br />
Are these ratings based solely on raid-linked achievements?<br />
Well ok then, how does this differ from simply putting the loot on a hard mode - such as was introduced in Ulduar?</div></div><hr />

A system like this is already in place: KILLING THE BOSS.<br />
<br />
If you can't beat arena teams, you can't get the gear. If you can't kill the raid bosses, you can't get the gear.<br />
<br />
But Prinsesa! How about being able to get tier pieces that drop from Super Anub'Arak by just buying them with Emblems, even if you never kill Super Anub'Arak himself?<br />
<br />
Just as a player is able to buy PvP pieces with honor even without having to beat a single arena team, then a player would be able to buy PvE pieces with emblems even without having to beat a single raid boss.<br />
<br />
Just as a player is unable to fill all of his PvP slots with honor-bought gear, a player is still unable to fill of his PvE slots with emblem-bought gear even with this change.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bg</div><div class="date">2009-06-30, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If raiding is done for fun, then people will raid for fun regardless of what non-raiders can acquire.<br />
<br />
Also, who are you to determine what is and isn't fun for people? If I can get my jollies from trying to complete Drak'tharon Keep on my Paladin tank without ever dropping combat, who are you to say that shouldn't be fun for me?<br />
<br />
You're right, the whole point of an MMO is for people can spend more time to have access to better things.<br />
<br />
What you missed is that I may have as much time to spend as Joe McRaider, but I'm unable to access those better things because the 3-4 hours I'm willing to spend is broken up into 1 hour segments, unlike Joe's 3-4 hours that he spends in one sitting.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To correct your statements, i never said you cant have fun doing other things, i said the point of us &quot;hardcore players&quot; raiding, is because its fun, not because it gives us gear. The reason we dont like people wearing the same gear as us is a simple fact of life, people who do not work for something, do not deserve it.<br />
<br />
Your second statement also misses entirely. If you play 1 hour segments and a raider plays 3-4 hour segments, in the long run that does not even out as you suggest. Using your logic over the course of a week, you play for 7 hours, and joe plays for 21+ hours. Obviously i dont believe any of this, as time played =/= skill and time spent doing dailies =/= time spent killing hard modes in ulduar. The amount of time you spend playing the game has absolutely no bearing on any of this. Even if you play 10 times as much as a raider does, that raider spends his time raiding and you do not, therefor you should not get a free ride to the same things he dedicates all his time to.<br />
<br />
The reward must equal the work put in.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To follow your logic: Because wow DOESN'T do it the way the &quot;average mmo&quot; does it, it is the most successful one. Right?<br />
<br />
<br />
Woosh? What do you mean by the term successful? If you mean successful as in the amount of subscribers, then yes wow is the most successful. If you mean successful as in well designed, great storyline, graphics, devs/gms, content etc etc.. then no, wow is at the bottom of the list.<br />
<br />
My point was that compared to previous mmos, WoW is its own breed. It may have been originally made to be a top challenging and fun mmo, but in the end its simply turned out to be a cash cow for blizzard. They have no intentions of making it an intricate mmo that requires time and skill for everything, its a &quot;mainstream&quot; mmo that does everything it can to show it wants Quantity (money) over Quality<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Are these ratings based on all achievements? ...<br />

I simply said that for fun, as an example. It would be nice to have some sort of PVE rating :P<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Are you slow? If i cant beat arena teams, i can go do VoA for free furious gear, if i cant kill the raid bosses, now i can go do heroic Violet hold and get it. Did you not read anything at all? thats why we are posting. This system is in place now, and is quickly being removed.<br />
<br />
Also you can only buy older (2 seasons past?) arena gear with honor, however with this new badge system you will be able to buy up to date raid gear, not tier 7 as it should be if it copied the system.</div></div><hr />

Gear is supposed to be a reward for doing harder content, or being a better player.<br />
<br />
For example, imagine if they decided to not put any new loot in this coliseum thing, and just took all of the 5 man heroic gear and gave it to those bosses. Of course people would still raid, because it's more fun, but why should the raiders need to farm consumables, spend 300g repairs per night, gather up 24 other people, and concentrate all night in order to get the same gear as the people doing heroics?<br />
<br />
You know how 5v5s give more points than 3v3, and 3v3 gives more points than 2v2? What was Blizzard's reasoning? It takes more effort, thus gives a greater reward, to gather 4 others to play with than to gather 1. It's the same principle.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, you should be rewarded with gear that people who log on for their 30 minutes, steamroll a heroic with their hunter pet tank, and don't have to pay any repairs don't have access to.<br />

There's some interesting math earlier in the thread you might like to read which demonstrates how much more time it takes to earn this gear as a casual. Not in terms of &quot;I've played the same amount as you, just over more weeks - hand me my purps&quot; but in terms of &quot;I haven't been doing the same kind of work so it's taken me longer in game time to earn these than it took you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your idea that epics are earned by skill is three to four years out of date. <br />
<br />
As a raider I am more than happy for people to earn this gear in a different manner to me because there's more to be had out there than set pieces; because you STILL cannot get the BEST gear without being good at your chosen part of the game, and because there's achievements that will sit there and tell everyone exactly what I did to get my gear. More importantly, I'll know what I did to get it. <br />
You don't win WoW by taking every one else's toys.</div></div><hr />

Max Triumph badges you can get per week without running the new content: 21<br />
Max Conquest badges: Lots<br />
<br />
If you've been running Heroic Ulduar for the better part of the time since it came out, you've likely run out of uses for Conquest badges already, and are currently farming for your breaking raiders and offspecs. <br />
<br />
What do these changes mean if you're an end-game raider?<br />
You'll still have the better gear faster (your e-peens will still heft more girth), and you will have an excuse to do older stuff like Heroics and Naxx again; I mean, I'm sure Runed Orbs won't *completely* depreciate, and there's always a time we could use BoE bracers and gems for alts. <br />

<br />
I really don't like these little changes making the game more friendly. It destroys the essence of what made this game great. This game didn't get 10 million players because of good quests, good pvp, good crafting... it got it because of its raid content and how epic it was.<br />
<br />
Regarding lock out changer, I don't like that change. In a guild some would have preferred progress while others preferred gear but at least the lock out was always there. Now we are going to have problems with some people wanting gear and some people wanting new bosses killed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously though. My point of contention when QD came out and everyone was running around in epics is the same now. Why do casuals need shiny epic gear? If they don't want to participate in 25 man raiding, why do they need i245 gear? If they're only gonna farm Naxx10/25/Ulduar 10, why do they need the newest setups?<br />
<br />
Most of us who cleared Naxx in the first couple weeks of Wrath did so in random quest blues/heroic gear. So fine, adjust the skill level of a hardcore raider versus a casual. They step foot into a raid in i200-i213 gear, and take weeks/months to clear it. Then when they step foot in the waters of the next raid, they cry NERF!!! Then they're handed i232-245 so they can casually walk all over the encounters we worked hard to take down...<br />
<br />
My thought... maybe blizz should introduce class tutorials for people to learn to play better, instead of crying for more gear and nerfs.<br />

<br />
While gearing up your main spec with your raiding, you'll have a far easier time gearing your offspec. I bet ICC has a lot of 'we're going to need you in a different role' encounters within it; I mean, if it didn't have to do with the end-game at all, why bother with dual spec?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If Player A could not defeat Naxx until he's fully decked out in Emblem bought T9, it took him the better part of a year to enjoy a Death's Bite from KT. How does that diminish all the moments that you enjoyed with your own Death's Bite so many months earlier?<br />
<br />
The same argument keeps getting brought up whenever Blizzard lowers mount costs. So what if epic flyers suddenly cost 1k less to buy, does that suddenly invalidate all of the time it saved you for you having it so much earlier than everyone else?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why? Because there is only one color variation per class. T7 and T8 had different colors for 10man and 25man, and T9 has three sub-tiers...<br />
<br />
So it's probably a Dungeon set, new drops for Heroic bosses and/or Emblem reward.</div></div><hr />

For the badge bought Tier gear - Again a great idea on blizzards part. Honestly the days of epic set gear meaning someone was a better player than someone else is long gone. Now you have to prove yourself as a player and not just outgear someone to be carried by your gear.<br />
<br />
Before someone launches the flame volley at me. . . I have played this game since shortly after launch ( was a FFXI player till a friend turned me on to WoW ) and have raided every instance this game has ever put out since the days of MC &amp; BWL all the way up to Ulduar. Cleared Pre-nerf Vashj and Kael and was working on Mu'ru before the snooze patch came out. I personally LOVE the challenges that those fights brought but I am glad to see Blizz doing this because it allows people to change classes / Spec a lot easier to help guilds out in the long run in whatever instance comes out in the future and have the gear to hit the ground running.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Raiding is a group activity: it requires 9 or 24 other players of similar ability and gear to enjoy. By giving out high ilevel gear (via emblems of Triumph and Valor), Blizzard will further reduce the numbers of people who want and are able to raid. On servers where recruitment is already a problem - small recruitment pool/many awful players - this will hit casual raiding guilds in particular. Therefore it impacts on my 'own personal ability to clear my own cutting-edge content' as you put it.<br />
<br />
The gear reset argument ie., Det's post above is valid but only applies to a minority of cases. The bigger picture is that you will end up with a reduced number of competent players raiding.<br />
<br />

<br />
Second, I'm a huge fan of making the tokens universal. It's been more and more apparent as we move forward that Blizz doesn't care who has tier gear, and I think that's a smart move. The casuals get their purples, the HC-Casuals get their sets in a reasonable amount of time, and the REAL HC guilds don't give a damn. Honestly, who does this affect? The casuals are the casuals, they're never going to see a hard mode. The HC guilds are HC, they beat the shit out of the average member's guild, and I'd be willing to bet they're not too jumped up about this change. The only people this really affects are the people who SEE themselves as HC, despite the fact that they dont have the gear/skill. They are the ones crying about the Casuals being able to get as geared as they can. If you really were HC, you'd be doing hardmodes, where the real loots drop. <br />
<br />
tl;dr<br />
Casuals are happy.<br />

The leader can be ass and extend their xy-whatever lockout for another week just to fuck them up.<br />
On the other hand it would be enough if the extension only works for the leader.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think there should be any problem. I think hitting the extend timer option would only extend your personal timer. From there, either everyone in the raid would have to do it, or just make that person the leader next week and people would copy off their save.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We both benefitted from the badges of heroism system. Two tiered items and a some other badge loot to boot. From the benefits of puggable content i was able to join a fairly decent guild and so did he (one of the requirements from both guilds was we had atleast naxx10/badgeloot so that we could raid naxx25 for example).<br />
<br />
I have continued raiding, even being new to the Deathknight class system, i find my rotations tight, my itemisation sensible and my knowledge ever increasing as this class develops. I'm an excellent dpser.<br />
<br />
The rogue on the otherhand, is an extremely poor dpser and will always be so, with poor raid awareness and a strange personality to boot.<br />
<br />
Roll on patch 3.2...and assume that me and the same rogue have just dinged 80. The same benefits are still available to us. The only thing we perhaps lack is raid experience, but this by no means amount to player skill and potential.<br />
<br />
The point i'm trying to make to the so called esteemed hardcore, yes poor players will certainly benefit from this system (if they have the time to do so) but there are potentially good players out there that can benefit too.<br />
<br />
Final point: noone has a right to judge who is deserving or not when new content is released. Paying a sub every month of £9 for over 4 years and not being able to see the new content available and not having items upgradeable if i don't have the means to raid? C'mon, surely that would be the greatest crime.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been playing this game for 5 years, if people don't understand by now that everything you &quot;work for&quot; in this game eventually becomes easy and pointless they need to stop playing. That's why I laugh at people who sit in IF NOW on Baron's mount. Maybe 2 years ago that would be impressive. Everything in this game eventually becomes easy because that's what Blizzard does. Nerfs everything and makes nothing worth noting.<br />
<br />
The only real problem against casuals people should have is that most of the time they are mediocre players when it comes to raiding, but raiding isn't exactly hard anymore so they can afford to be. Can't believe people still bring this up.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dude, if you're crying over how easy it is to obtain good items in WoW, you might want to cancel your subscription and play another game.<br />
<br />
WoW has always been the casual gamers MMO. It's the easiest MMO, the fastest MMO to get good gear in, easiest MMO to play and the most forviging MMO. Even vanilla WoW was kids mode compared to other MMO's. So your pseudo-hardcore mentality is pretty much thrown out of the window considering that's how Warcraft is designed. Cater to everyone is they key here. Not just cater to the top 5% of players.<br />
<br />
And let's see from a hypothetical business standpoint:<br />
<br />
- Casual gamers play WoW for 4 years, still in blues/green, and won't be able to advance due to good gear being in raids etc etc.<br />
- Casual gamers don't have the time commitment to raid, cannot advance and lose interest<br />
- Casual gamers quit playing WoW<br />
- Blizzard lose millions of subsribers<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
- Hardcore gamers play WoW for 4 years, in epics and advance from raid to raid<br />
- Blizzard start making it easier for casuals to obtain gear and hardcores get pissed off<br />
- Hardcore gamers quit WoW<br />
- Blizzard loses a small fraction of subscribers<br />
<br />
<br />
Bottom line: If you don't like the direction that WoW is going, feel free to cancel your subscription. I don't know why you're even playing WoW, since it's the Barney the Dinosaur of MMO's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I started playing WoW back in the halcyon days where a purple item linked in guild chat was met with 'ooohs and ahhhs'. A toon wearing full T3 was someone to almost be acknowledged with quiet reverence at the skill/time needed to achieve such a feat. Not to mention the amount of sucking up to the Random Number Generator gods they must have done....but I digress. My guild did ZG until I finally got both claws off the tiger and panther bosses. They had a 2-3% chance of dropping. Some of the ZG bosses didn't even drop ANY epics due to RNG. Imagine that if you will, a whole night raiding and you aren't even guaranteed a purple! It's unfathomable now.<br />
<br />
Our first Gruul kill in BC (after 3 weeks of attempts) was a warm memory I look back on in terms of great moments in playing videogames. Pre-nerf Vashj? The icing on the cake, people were exultant over Vent. We spent over a month wiping on Kael. Over a MONTH. But we got him. THAT was achievement. Then everything got nerfed. People who had never even seen the Kael fight were rolling over Illidan. We spent a month or so in our guild getting up to Gurtogg. Within a week of the patch hitting, we had killed Illidan. The game felt empty, our time spent seemed oddly wasted....not from a social viewpoint though admittedly. <br />
<br />
But how the game has changed.....<br />
<br />
Looking at these changes, I remember that as a raider, I used to bitch wholeheartedly about the fact that 'bloody Mage/Hunter/Shaman tokens' would drop continuously, leaving us throwing half of them out. I remember thinking 'there has to be a smarter way to do this!'. Why should you have to kill Archimonde over 20 times to ensure you get a helm you by rights earned weeks ago?<br />
<br />
At the end of the day team, we all like tier gear. If we as raiders get it faster, all good. If your guild is suddenly short DPS/Heals/Tanks, why should a committed guildie have to cycle his alt to the back of the loot queue, being asked for bullshit achievements and getting knocked back from PuG runs he has already done on his main?<br />
<br />
There has to be a balance, but I see this as being a good step.<br />
<br />
TL;DR - Suck it up. This game has and ALWAYS will be designed around the decisions of a bunch of suits with profit and loss statement in front of them. All of your achievements, all of your gear, all of your progress will one day be rendered obsolete and discarded the day the losses outnumber the profits. Or until something shinier comes along. We get to see the content, we see it with our friends, we get our gear? Why do we care who else does?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I see us using it like this:<br />
Two Senarios<br />
<br />
Senario 1<br />
Week 1: Reach Mimiron on Ulduar25 &gt; Some one relogs an ALT (saves the alt to the raid)<br />
Week 2: We have 25 online and ready Wednesday so we decide to not use our save and just go for a full run.<br />
<br />
Senario2<br />
Week 1: Reach Mimiron on Ulduar25 &gt; Some one relogs an ALT (saves the alt to the raid)<br />
Week 2: Both Wednesday and Thursday we fail to get a full raid online, so we decide to just continue from our save since we know we wont have enough time to clear the bosses we have on farm.<br />
<br />
I think this system will work for some, meybe not others, and certainly it wont help every single week.</div></div><hr />

Getting loot used to be a &quot;special&quot; occasion in this game but I came back to the game after Ulduar was released and my guild geared me up with full BiS in 1-2 weeks. I wish they would bring back BWL style but obviously won't happen. I remember having a full set of T2 was really something to be proud of. <br />
<br />
I really don't like these little changes making the game more friendly. It destroys the essence of what made this game great. This game didn't get 10 million players because of good quests, good pvp, good crafting... it got it because of its raid content and how epic it was.<br />
<br />
Regarding lock out changer, I don't like that change. In a guild some would have preferred progress while others preferred gear but at least the lock out was always there. Now we are going to have problems with some people wanting gear and some people wanting new bosses killed.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is the essence of it right here. T6 used to feel epic wearing it around and something you could be proud of... now I see scrubs running around in 4/5 T8.5 and its not like the hard modes really reward that much better gear.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, Garona wore *THAT*? Fucking bright light fixtures on our shoulders? The entire set is uninspired, the shoulders look like Arathi Basin shoulders, the helmet looks like the non-set helmet from Naxx, and the chest/hands/legs/feet are boring.<br />
<br />
There's just no way that *that* is the aesthetic superior to Tier 8. I'm going to be hard pressed to equip that garbage, especially since the 4piece is like a .01% dps increase for mutilate.<br />

If WoW having less grind means it's easier (it doesn't really) then fine, it's a better game. If you fail to see this, you should probably be playing some Korean grindfest.</div></div><hr />

Max Triumph badges you can get per week without running the new content: 21<br />
Max Conquest badges: Lots<br />
<br />
If you've been running Heroic Ulduar for the better part of the time since it came out, you've likely run out of uses for Conquest badges already, and are currently farming for your breaking raiders and offspecs. <br />
<br />
What do these changes mean if you're an end-game raider?<br />
You'll still have the better gear faster (your e-peens will still heft more girth), and you will have an excuse to do older stuff like Heroics and Naxx again; I mean, I'm sure Runed Orbs won't *completely* depreciate, and there's always a time we could use BoE bracers and gems for alts. <br />
Excuse me a moment. <br />
*bwahahahahahahaha*<br />

Not 21, at least 24, cause KORALON he´ll drop 1 in normal mode and 2 in hc mode, so more easy to take T 9 xD.</div></div><hr />

It's not even about the stats on the gear at this point. It's about the self-righteous assholes who are SURE they should be the only ones wearing tier gear. See anyone posting in this thread from the top 20 or so progression guilds in the world? And why is that? Because they don't need prettier backs to look at to know they're better than you (and me). <br />

Tier Gear means nothing. If you play for that 'silent reverence' you got strolling through Org in T3, you've got issues. They're fucking pixels.</div></div><hr />

Tell me again how the PvE gear someone else has affects you, now that this gear isn't the best PvP gear like it was in pre-BC WoW?<br />
<br />
<br />
It will affect many raids, you will have people who have been completely decked out in T9 and wont know anything about what they are to do in raids. Overall making pugs alot worse than they are, bad players in good gear? Thats not how its supposed to be. Bad players are suppose to remain in there blues and greens if they are not good enough to complete raids that require a little bit of team work and cooperation.<br />
<br />
Heroics dont require much teamwork. Healer and tank are the main two that ever have to worry about much, other than every once in a while dps have to move away from something. So why would you want someone who had to do half the work you did to get their tier pieces an equivalent to you?<br />
Farming heroics is not hard. I can probably get about 50-80 marks in a couple days. Thats a piece of tier right there for god sake. That wasnt how the game used to be. Completeling raids was your only ticket to tier gear and thats how it should have remained.</div></div><hr />

Why does it matter?<br />
One run, and the goods will always be able to pick out the bads. Even mediocre guilds nowadays have an app, a bad in good gear still has a bad's understanding of their class. I'd LOVE to know how giving pugs better gear without tuning up the instance makes them &quot;Alot worse&quot;. Are you pugging current endgame content? That's the only situation where this becomes even slightly relevant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So you are complaining about people getting t9 gear with badges...and then say that you can grind one in a couple days. Because the 3 triumph badges you get each day will get you there right?<br />
<br />
This change means &quot;noobs&quot; and &quot;casuals&quot; will now have easy access to t8 equivalent gear and over a LONG period of time CC quality gear. It also means when your guild needs to pick up a solid player to finish off Ice Crown, you don't have to snipe a player from another guild and you don't have to spend 2-3 weeks gearing them up in Ulduar/CC before you can hope to progress in IC.<br />
<br />
The game has changed. There is still benefit in these changes for hard core guilds as well. The only thing they lose is their unique look...and god forbid you lose that! How will you ever down Arthas hard mode if you don't look unique! If you are truly hard core...then your gear will still be better and you can still lord your e-peen over the dirty casuals...don't worry. That's what hard modes are for.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Haha, with the new emblem change it would take about 63 heroics to get all emblems for full set of tier. This is if all instances you do have 5 emblem drops &lt;.&lt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Only problem is heroics don't drop the badges you need for t9. You get 3 a day from heroics and then badges from the raid.</div></div><hr />

Secondly this will finally give raiders and incentive to run some heroics, personally i really enjoy doing heroics but i can never get any done cause getting people in my guild to do em is like pulling teeth. SO i'd like to throw it out there that not all raiders are e-peen stroking assholes, I'm only 2 or 3 weeks away from my rusted proto :D<br />

No ideea what Blizzard is thinking.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It's as much for the raiding guilds as the casual players. Why do I say that? Because the real issue here is not casuals, seeing content, etc. It's time. <br />
<br />
There will be a new expansion for this game out soon and Blizzard still has us with 2 months or so in Ulduar, then they have to give us time to do both Argent Coliseum AND Icecrown Citadel, and get them all done before this expansion hits. Since it's quite likely the expansion will be out in less than a year, Blizzard needs not only casuals able to see the content (as they've said is a goal), but also for the raiding guilds to get through them and the associated hard modes before the new xpac is released. They do NOT want another Sunwell or original Naxxramas, where only a very small amount of people got to see any of it worth mentioning. They WANT people to see the Lich King and to experience defeating him. Being able to buy your tier sets faster artificially speeds this process up, but that's what they need to happen. They've got a lot of content for us still to burn through and not much time for that to happen.</div></div><hr />

most of the time you will find a bunch of bad players in pugs...so first of all don't pug if you don't want to play with them<br />
<br />
the better thing is...is that pugs are for casual players...or players that can't abher to a guilds raid schedule....as in me...now i have gotten all my gear from mostly pugging...but that's not the point...<br />
<br />
if you are pugging and there is almost definately gonna be bad players in your raid...would you rather have bad players in crappy gear doing 1500 dps on a boss or bad players in epic gear doing 2,000-2,500 dps?</div></div><hr />

This is if all instances you do have 5 emblem drops &lt;.&lt;<br />

<br />
This isn't good math. You can get 3 triumph emblems per day with the current 5-man dungeons - 1 for the reg daily, 2 for the heroic <br />
<br />
14 dailies per week will net you 21 Triumph emblems. <br />
<br />
If you're just shooting for i232, you need 210 for all 5 pieces: <br />
10 weeks of doing both dailies every day, or 140 instances. <br />
<br />
If you're going for i245, you need 315 for all 5: <br />
15 weeks of doing both dailies every day, or 210 instances. <br />

There's still an incentive for people to actually run the raid instances themselves, since it drastically reduces the time to assemble all those Emblems and rewards you with drops for slots that the Emblems cannot provide for, most importantly your weapons.<br />

Everybody fails to see that part.</div></div><hr />

i feel as tho these 7 days were given to us to rotate raids and progress a certain way,<br />
a bunch of wipes due to new content doesnt mean we need more time<br />
it means we need to take the time we have to try and figure out a strategy of our own way,<br />
i feel if this extension hapens the pugs will have worse security on raid ids and stealing them as well,<br />
and the reason that we have resets also is that people can get geared up for harder bosses like for instance:<br />
<br />
A raid stops at Kologarn for the night there because of wipes, and they want to try again the next day and they keep wiping from having no gear thats ulduar ready for this boss,<br />
but they use the extension of time and keep going and keep wiping<br />
maybe its not the fight but the gear itself and if they use the extension to waste more time and gold,<br />
why not restart on bosses you can down? and get better gear so maybe next time you can take on that Kologarn fight alot more smooth without wasting as much time and as much gold therefore less wipe, more gear, and less ppl quiting on wipes for the same boss,<br />
and i know strategy is a main quality as such time and gear but if it takes too long to even try and come up with the strategy and you waste gold from repairs then why keep that particular save and get no more gear to better yourself?<br />

25 people will need 125 pieces of Tier-Tokens. With 10 dropping each week they will need at least 13 weeks if nothing drops more than you need it. And these people will actualy have to PLAY the raid content to get the gear.<br />

<br />
This is all about the 7 days extension.<br />
There might be more options to how they do it, but here's 2:<br />
1. The raid leader can choose to extend or not to extend for the whole raid group.<br />
2. Each individual can choose themselves (probably raid leader extends and individuals cancel it when they want to)<br />
<br />
For option 1 there are probably arguments for and against, but I for one think it would be bad for pugs or even for guilds who have people who can't join on raiding days for 2 weeks and would like to pug it the 2nd week.<br />
<br />
Now my post is really about option 2: letting the individual choose to be part of an extension or not.<br />
<br />
Consider Raid group A filled up with alts who can clear the &quot;easy&quot; part of an instance, say first 5 bosses.<br />
Raid group B is filled up with mains who only want to progress on the last bosses (after the first 5).<br />
We also have 2 players / alts X1 and X2 who doesn't raid.<br />
<br />
1st week:<br />
Group A kills 5 bosses, invites the inactive player X1 at the end to get him saved and extends the lockout. Then all other raiders except X1 removes the extension so that X1 is the only one with an extended lockout.<br />
2nd week:<br />
Group A starts in a new instance and kills the 5 first bosses, invites X2 and do like in week 1.<br />
Group B includes the saved X1 who have killed the first 5 bosses, gets the group saved and X1 leaves group B to kill the last bosses.<br />
3rd week:<br />
Like 1st week for group A, group B invites X2 and so on. So the only ones actually using the extension is X1 and X2...<br />
<br />
I guess Blizzard already thought of this and have put some limits if they let individuals choose though :)<br />

So if you don't think its a good option, then don't use it. Problem solved. There is nothing in the patch notes about blizzard forcing everyone to use this feature. Worried about what happens when you get in pugs that might use this feature....don't pug, again, problem solved.</div></div><hr />

Looking at the ss I think each individual can choose to extend o not their individual save. Say three guys get saved; only player 1 chooses to extend the save. Next wednesday player 2 is invited to the same raid as 1, who's RL, and thus gets 1's save (again), but 3 decides to go with a different raid and creates a diiferent save number.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nahyo</div><div class="date">2009-06-30, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can anyone clarify this question:<br />
<br />
Do the Regalia Tokens ONLY drop from the new 25-man isntance? And then in the 10-man hard mode as well? Or does regalia drop in all of the new raids, but the regalia token you get depends on what mode ur in? (ie.10man normal: 232 set, 10man heroic: 239 set, 25man normal: 239 set, 25 heroic, 245 set)<br />
<br />
This would make the most sense... and then those who can't raid can slowly work their way up to either the 232 set (much shorter wait) or the 239 set (much longer but more powerful)?<br />
<br />
I think this system (above) makes the most sense. Also then having the triumph tokens drop in these raids as well depending on the mode (1per boss 10man normal, 2per boss 10man heroic/25 normal, 3per boss 25man heroic).</div></div><hr />

All the other members of the raid will have their lockout reset as normal. The following week, the leader creates the raid and all members will be 'saved' to the raid leaders extended raid at that time. This practically works for anyone.<br />
<br />
The current issue being debated on the PTR is how this is scripted. For example, a member of a raid can extend his/her lockout without the raid leader's consent. The raid leader may also extend his/her lockout, and continue raiding the following week (without the member). The member can then form his or her own raid and continue from that lockout. <br />
Essentially, a raid can be 'stolen' by a member.<br />
<br />
As for the Rogues and the fact that their armor is 'bright and shiny'... well, how often are you stealthed in a boss fight?<br />

Totally agree.<br />
<br />
Valorous T7 and Conquerors T8 was easy enough to get. They should have a third set only for 25m hard modes that not only have a different color scheme (like Heroes-&gt;Valorous or Valorous-&gt;Conquerors), but also a different look.

<br />
I don't understand your anger, and I didn't imply that in the slightest. <br />
<br />
Raiders will get T9 set bonuses much faster than the rest, because they can breeze through the heroic 5-mans and fill spaces in their i258 set with i245/i232 gear through emblem purchases. <br />
<br />
My point was that persons just doing the 5-mans will have to wait at least 2.5 months to get a set, and probably more. 3.2 won't mean fewer Loken, HoS, and Oculus wipes.</div></div><hr />

If they don't want to participate in 25 man raiding, why do they need i245 gear? If they're only gonna farm Naxx10/25/Ulduar 10, why do they need the newest setups?<br />
<br />
They really don't. These epics aren't for people who farm heroics (if those people even exist) though, they are for the same people QD epics were for - those guilds who are still stuck on the Watches at the moment. They need the newest setups because they're simply not as &quot;good&quot; as those farming Ulduar (of which there's few) and need to outgear the content to progress.<br />
<br />
More to the point, WHO CARES if Captain Heroic Farm has i245 gear when the gear goes up to i258. You might as well bitch about people getting heroic gear without having to farm naxx.</div></div><hr />

If they don't want to participate in 25 man raiding, why do they need i245 gear? If they're only gonna farm Naxx10/25/Ulduar 10, why do they need the newest setups?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course they don't need it- it's just a video game after all. <br />
<br />
But at the same time, if you're playing an FPS and you see a rocket launcher on the ground, do you stop and reflect upon whether or not you need, or deserve, that BFG instead of your little pistol, or do you just grab it and blow sh*t up? <br />
<br />
Everyone wants to see their characters get more powerful- that's the major hook of this game. <br />
<br />
Besides, by the time these &quot;evil casuals&quot; get full raid sets there'll be 1 or 2 new tiers in the game anyway.</div></div><hr />

Yes... it is.<br />

Some people who are actually good at the game don't like the idea of looking exactly the same as the people who spam trade chat with &quot;LFM 4 ULDAR 25 FL ONLY PST ME!&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Someone articulates a different point of view and is then patronised and told they are just plain wrong? No half way ground, no compromise, no debate, only dismissal. We're just wrong, folks. Not just wrong, we're 'slightly stoopid' children.<br />
<br />
I've read and agreed with Det's arguments about the value of 'gear reset' provided by the changes to the emblem system (for alts, ppl who come back from breaks, etc. etc.). Will he/she accept the validity of other posters' arguments? That this change will go further to undermine the player base from which guilds can recruit active, competent raiders?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Why would the emblem system reduce the number of raiders when it offers a fantastic way for people lagging behind in the gear curve to catch up to progression-level stats, and at the same time incentivizing raiding by offering an alternative to the massive, daily-heroic-3-month grind?<br />
<br />
People keep saying that suddenly people will refuse to raid because they can get the same gear without having to raid. What they don't seem to acknowledge is that this has absolutely no bearing on people that enjoy raiding for raiding's sake, and that anyone who raids for gear is still going to raid for gear because the emblem system still has some gaping itemization holes in it (most notably a weapon).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also raid extension has to be individual, there is no &quot;raid leader&quot; once the raid disbands, just raid ids.</div></div><hr />

This is also probably why the Coliseum is hard-gating the release of bosses one by one.</div></div><hr />

It's a good point, but this game has always come with baggage players (carried around raids) it'll just mean that when you are recruiting it's no longer a case of looking at the armoury and that alone.<br />
<br />
Personally I'm mixed with this change, they've essentially made the current tier easier to get with the badges change. Do we really need this as well?</div></div><hr />

I only get to raid 2-3 nights a week. What this means to me, my upgrades are meaningful to me. My gear is not an extension of my skill, Hell, I can't get Trinkets to drop to save my soul. My gear is, however, a reminder that I have a sizable pool of people who routinely choose me to make certain that mob a, b, and c, spend whole fights Not targeting them. <br />
<br />
My main point is: Grow some Damned Self Esteem!!! I don't Suck, my Gear reflects that, My experience reflects that, my Raids repair bills reflect that. If you don't know your value without looking at Ugly Armor sets, then take a break for some Introspection.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frazle</div><div class="date">2009-07-09, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A Single Token to rule them all... Sorry lost track of what I was gonna say...<br />
<br />
A single token... hmm well I guess one could say that an entire raid of 10 could be geared in a relatively short period of time and never get more than 1/2 through the instance.<br />
<br />
I dunno... I like for my specific point of view...<br />
<br />
- Very low pop server<br />
- Horde out number us 2 or 3 to 1 maybe more @ lvl 80<br />
- Most serious Alliance raiders have long since server xfered<br />
<br />
Those of us poor slobs left have to play the hand that was dealt and it usually means guilds with 10 to 15 'good' non-hardcore players (not raiders but players) and we are relegated to 10 man content at the most and often we don't even raid at all cause 2 or 3 people pulled a no show.<br />
<br />
Yea I need to xfer but try convincing my wife of that when she has people she'd really miss... I knew getting her into wow would be good in that she wouldn't be harping at me to get off the game but now it's come back to bite right on the old gluteus maximus...<br />
<br />
So.. back to tokens.. yea for a guy in my spot.. where we at the most do 3 wings of nax over the weekend... I'm sure gonna be happy that I can still get myself geared seeing as we've never (the guild anyway) gotten to the last two encounters... I was pugging for a while and I did get in on all the fights and in one sitting no less... too bad I was just standing in for another guild that was 1 man short.<br />
<br />
For serious players... I could see them being put off by this... when all the while they knew that had to get to boss X to get the legs or head or whatever to drop... also when it comes to who gets what gear...<br />
<br />
Yea for the very laid back environment I'm in.. this is nice and simple... we do a standard 'who will benefit the most' from a drop and usually give it to that person. mage X has tier gear x4 and mage Y only has teir gear x2 well mage Y gets it.<br />
<br />
In a more 'aggressive' environment I can see all kinds of problems with this.... and for guilds who use DKPs ... heck... the guy with a ton of DKPs could get 4 or even 5 tokens in his first run. Given the dumb luck that the same 'class token' dropped each time or almost each time. Not sure how that would go over... but then again those kinds of issues were always present...<br />
