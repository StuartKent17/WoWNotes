Nothing really interesting lately, but it's better than nothing. <br />
Sunwell Armor Sets aren't really a proper &quot;tier&quot; upgrade<br />
If you remember Ahn'Qiraj you'll remember the sets there shared the same art style for each armor type, with color shifts for each class, which is the same as it is for these items. Like the Sunwell items the Ahn'Qiraj items weren't a proper &quot;tier&quot; upgrade, then called 2.5, the Sunwell items could probably be called 6.5 if you want.

Epic flying mount price changes in WotLK<br />
Depending on how mount riding skills are going to progress, the most likely point for a price drop would be with the release of the next expansion, just as the ground mount prices dropped when Burning Crusade was released. Again it would likely depend on a few factors, and may actually not change. But that's a question for a later time.

Blizzard acquires Diablo3.com<br />
Diablo3.com has been officialy acquired by Blizzard, it definitely looks like they've got something in mind ... The World Wide Invitational this summer sounds promising. Below is the post from the original owner of the domain.<br />
<br />
[i]Well, there's no point in beating around the bush any longer, so let's get right down to it. A few months ago we were contacted by Blizzard in regards to the Diablo3.com domain name. While they appreciate all the work that's been put into running this big Diablo fan community over the years, they still want the domain name. Hmm, I wonder why? Now before you get all up in arms about it, allow me to explain a few things.<br />
<br />
First off, this fan site isn't going anywhere, it's just getting a new name: Diablofans.com! Blizzard is actually being really cool about it, giving us all the time we need to make it a smooth transition before we hand the old domain over to them. So be sure to update all of your bookmarks and point 'em to diablofans.com instead. Your user accounts will all still be perfectly functional and, along with this new site name, we'll soon have a big site redesign up and running as well. A new name, a new look. Huzzah!<br />
<br />
Secondly, while Blizzard is indeed acquiring the diablo3.com domain name, they told me that this shouldn't be considered an announcement for the Diablo 3 game we've been waiting for all these years. They acquire new domains all the time. While this is true, I personally can't help but think that this is a confirmation of sorts that they're working on the next Diablo game. Sure, they can claim it's because they want to protect their intellectual properties 'n what have you, but I can't imagine they would all of a sudden be so interested in the diablo3.com domain if they weren't working on a new Diablo 3 game behind the scenes.<br />
<br />
On a final note, I want to thank all of you guys who've made this community so strong over the years. It's only going to get better around here and I hope you'll all stick with us. One of the nice things about this whole name-change ordeal is that Blizzard really appreciates the fact that we're a dedicated fan site and we'll be working with them much more closely in the future to bring you the latest Diablo game news.<br />
<br />
Update - Some gaming news sites are reporting that Blizzard &quot;purchased&quot; the diablo3.com domain from me. This is not the case. As I stated in the above post, if it was my intention to make a profit off of the domain, I could've sold it years ago, but I didn't. When Blizzard spoke to me about their interest in the domain, I was happy to give it to them since they had no problems with us moving the site to diablofans.com and will now be working more closely with us in the future. So yeah, I just wanted to clear that up... there is no monetary exchange taking place, I'm simply giving Blizzard the diablo3 domain.<br />

And you're an idiot. Blizzard will be &quot;working closely&quot; with him now. He'll make a bit more money if he's site has at least as many adds as this one. And this one doesn't &quot;work closely&quot; with Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

See, this is a list of things that are going to happen PROBABLY.<br />
<br />
A good amount of cash on my account would have been the greater pleasure. Anyway, now we should all mind our own business. I'm pretty sure the admin of a site that big is not dumb, and he sure as hell thought everything over a couple of times :p</div></div><hr />

No it's not probably. If you knew the guy leading diablofans.com you'd know he's the most modest guy in the world. If he says &quot;we'll have future contact with Blizzard about their Diablo projects&quot; then this mean all that Comm said. And probably even more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed.<br />
What is interesting to me, having played blizzard games since diablo 1, is watching what they learn from game to game.<br />
They clearly learned a lot from diablo 2 and warcraft 3, took notes, and put those lessons into practice in WoW. The same goes for diablo 1 --&gt; 2.<br />
<br />
It will be interesting to see what they'll do with D3, when it is released in 2020.</div></div><hr />

would be nice to have a change room in the style of http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/items/armorsets/ :)<br />

and on the diablo3.com the domain name could have been acquired for any number of reasons.</div></div><hr />
