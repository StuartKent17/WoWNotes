Blizzard Celebrates 20 Years of Diablo<br />
As we approach the original game’s release anniversary on December 31, Blizzard Entertainment is thrilled to commemorate twenty years of Diablo. We’re ready to celebrate our passion for the world of Sanctuary and the brave heroes who inhabit it!<br />
<br />
Starting soon, you can experience special in-game events and goodies in Diablo III, Heroes of the Storm, Hearthstone, Overwatch, StarCraft II, and World of Warcraft to celebrate a few of the things we love about Diablo. These events and items will only be available for a limited time, so be sure to check them all out before they’re gone.<br />
<br />
A small taste of each tribute is below—keep an eye out for more details about these celebrations. . . and thank you, all of you, for allowing us to continue adventuring in the world of Sanctuary. Here’s to twenty years of loot!<br />
<br />
Diablo III:<br />
Recapture the feeling of your first play through of the original Diablo with The Darkening of Tristram tribute event. Venture through a reimagined version of the original cathedral in Diablo III and keep an eye out for some familiar items.<br />
Heroes of the Storm:<br />
<br />
The battle for the High Heavens continues, and a new Diablo-themed portrait is up for grabs! Can you emerge victorious on this hectic new brawl map?<br />
<br />
Hearthstone:<br />
In this Tavern Brawl, a hooded stranger awaits, holding a grim deck in his hands. Will you unravel the secrets surrounding this dark wanderer?<br />
<br />
Overwatch:<br />
Bring the battle for Sanctuary into the fight for the future with in-game sprays representing your favorite Diablo III classes—along with a new player icon modeled after the Lord of Terror!<br />
<br />
StarCraft II:<br />
Put the Lord of Terror to work for you with a Diablo-themed worker portrait.<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft:<br />
Strange things are afoot in the world of Azeroth as denizens of Sanctuary cross over into an unfamiliar world. <br />
<br />
<br />
Diablo 20th Anniversary Event<br />
The Diablo 20th Anniversary (http://www.wowdb.com/world-events/636-diablo-20th-anniversary) event is coming soon! There is an achievement, music, and some items associated with the event. The Treasure Demons (Sanctuary Coins) and their Sanctuary Coins (http://www.wowdb.com/items/122291-sanctuary-coins) from Beta may also be related. <br />

Played every Diablo and expasion. Just recently found a 3rd party &quot;patch&quot; that allows you to actually play D1 on modern computers. Love it all.<br />
<br />
You still can with the CD-ROM. Works for me on Windows 7 and 10 but can't say for 8.1.</div></div><hr />

Well considering the dungeon is literally a map with filters turned on I was expecting more in the main game that it was aimed at. They made no attempt with the ingame event in Diablo. Hell WoW has more than Diablo 3 is getting.<br />
<br />
Also it has nothing to do with being spoiled. Diablo should be getting the most attention with promotions and events and the devs seem to be just being lazy about it. The only thing original about this dungeon is the 1996 filter that makes it look like Diablo 1.</div></div><hr />

I couldnt agree more. The original game and lore is so powerful, that it deserves more. World of Warcraft apparently is the goto game for Diablo Anniversary. Sure it could be fun to experience the old game on a new engine, but even the textures are the new ones. No need to make a &quot;remake&quot; of the old game.</div></div><hr />

With this for system requirements:<br />
PC<br />

There isn't any reason to not setup a virtual box, hyper-v, etc system on current modern setup. Set it up and run the game that way really. But hey that might be beyond the average user.</div></div><hr />

Me too, like really old. Played Diablo on my 486 DX 66 back then with a Trident Graphics Cards and 256 KB RAM. With a 14&quot; CRT.... and a 480 MB HDD.<br />
And a fucking Mitsubishi (at least I remember it was a Mitsubishi) 2x CDROM with an IDE &lt;&gt; ISA adapter card.<br />
<br />
Changed that a bit after to a P90 with a mirror video 2 mb card, but still.... thats like aeons ago.</div></div><hr />

I also had a Trident card in my p166, that thing was a beast! Sadly I was on 28.8, but I think my rom was 4x, pretty expensive, I bought it when I was 17 price tag was 2,001 dollars after taxes.</div></div><hr />

Any proves for you claims? Since the forums are outraged after all the Diablo shit in WoW currently. If anything, this endless item grind with a very low chance for an upgrade certainly didnt make the game better. All it does is make Blizzard more money.</div></div><hr />

Squelching? Squishing you mean. It was affect by the community cry out, as in it no longer restricting soloing of old content. And I also remember positive forum outcries like battle.net displaying your real name (WotLK), group looting &amp; flight (WoD) which changed the game for the better where Blizzards design/intent failed horribly.<br />
<br />
If you dont understand what people are upset about or if doesnt affect you in the first place, then why comment? This game would be nothing without its community. Even big names like Jeff Kaplan (Lead Game Designer on WoW and Overwatch) cried and even insulted the devs of the game they played prior to creating WoW.</div></div><hr />

Still, no one cares. Feedback, communication, crying or whatever you call it is all valid. Hence they even have forums and people are paid to collect such information.<br />
<br />
And like I told you before, just google &quot;Jeff Kaplan Everquest rent&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Dude Kaplan was one of the reason EQ went down the way it did. He threatened the Devs that he would go to another game (along with his guild and followers) if they didn't produce content at the rate he wanted.<br />
<br />
He is exactly the point I am trying to make. He and his buddies were the top players and also a very small % of players that were actually involved with EQ endgame that cried of the forums because the Devs didnt cater to their special snowflake needs. And they absolutely ruined that game.<br />
<br />

Not really, since MMOs back then werent about &quot;special snowflakes&quot;. Only the hardcore played them anyways. It was WoW which introduced the genre to a broad audience. Now they try to milk the cow with hack&amp;slash features on top of adding useless time gates on everything.</div></div><hr />

Any game can be hardcore. How stupid does someone have to be to think everyone pushes the hardest thing in a game? WoW is not the first game with casual players.</div></div><hr />

You never played Ragnarok Online I suppose? We farmed high lvl dungeons over 1 hour for like 0.01% EP (from 98&gt;99) - that game was the definition of a grind. Not to mention that there were no quests at the beginning (at least no exp quests) - just pure monster killing. An nothing like WoW...<br />
<br />
Slow hp/mp regen, only with potions you were kept alive, but not while sitting down, you drank them while killing monsters - only limit how many of them you could drink was defined in how fast you could click them (or the key for it). Quite different from WoW. Also no aggro system - the one first engaged by anything had to tank it. I'm quite surprised the game is still alive.<br />
<br />
Good lord, that game was so horrible in terms of mechanics at that time and still I loved it. But that is an age long forgotten, same with WoW. Even a legacy server won't bring back the old memories when everything was new. I will never have the same &quot;WTF&quot; moment in my life, as I went the first time tru the portal in BC with my hunter girl ... damn, it took me days to not shit my pants, when I heard the reaver. It was awesome.<br />
<br />
Yeah, times back then were easier and the internet was not a shithole like it is today. The endless discussions in IRCNet... and flamewars if netscape or IE is better. The weekly/monthly reinstall of Windows 95... The autoexec.bat and config.sys edits to get the last KB out of the memory so the darn game will run with the CDROM driver.<br />
<br />
Damn, I should stop there, I feel older by the second ... and still 12 days left till my birthday, when I turn 35.</div></div><hr />
