Patch 5.0.4 Download Size<br />
The update is going to be quite large and the background downloader should already be preparing you for the 29 of August. It will be approximately 6GB in size and will include all of the Mists of Pandaria content including Talents, Glyphs and stats.<br />
<br />
You will need to wait for the release of Mists of Pandaria to play Pandaren and you must upgrade your account to play a monk.<br />
<br />
The 21GB download is only if you are doing a completely fresh installation. If you are patching to 5.0.4 from the current patch then it is a great deal smaller, approximately 6GB. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/233290-504-question/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/5168468138?page=3#43))<br />
<br />
Reward Currencies: Conversions, 5.0.4, &amp; You!<br />
Can you continue earning JP/HP if you pass the soft cap of 4000. Remember, HARD CAP was removed (and that will only be from August 28 - September 25) since Valor and Conquest will convert to their lesser forms and any excess will go over the cap?<br />
<br />
The second question is currency conversion. When 5.1 drops (which is probably MoP), will we keep some JP/HP and have excess converted to gold; will all of it be converted to gold; or will no conversion happen?<br />
Yes, starting August 28, you can earn as much as you want, since there’s no cap at all on the Justice and Honor currencies from that day, until September 25. With Mists of Pandaria, the caps will be applied, and players will be reduced to 4000 Honor and 4000 Justice – any excess points will be converted on September 25 to gold at the rates described before.<br />
<br />
Are they seriously going to remove conquest points from regular BGs? One of the best changes in cata, and they're already going to take it away? <br />
Nope! There are no plans to remove Conquest from the Random Daily Battleground. We agree that it was a great change!<br />
<br />
What will be the conversion rate? Is it 1:1? or is it 2:1?<br />
On September 25, excess Honor over the cap will be converted at a rate of 35 silver per point, and excess Justice over the cap will be converted at a rate of 47 silver per point.<br />
<br />
Conquest points will be converted to Honor Points with patch 5.0.4. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/233093-reward-currencies-conversions-504-you/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6369528059?page=14#267))<br />
<br />
LFR Feedback<br />
It would be useful if we could form a guild group and set our own loot rules, essentially the same process we use in norm/heroic.<br />
Within LFR, boss loot is handled on a per-player basis using the new system, regardless whether you queued as a full group or used the matchmaking features. You should still be able to change the loot method you use to handle any drops from the non-boss creatures in the instance if you are a full premade, but the boss system is hardcoded. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/228799-the-new-lfr-roll-system-sucks/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/5911882445?page=18#357))<br />

150 Mount Achievement Update<br />
I've discussed this a bit with Cory Stockton (Mumper (https://twitter.com/mumper)). There won't be a new mount achievement with the launch of Mists of Pandaria, though we'll consider adding one in patch 5.1. We agree that it's probably time to set a new bar for mount collectors. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/233199-150-mount-achievement-update/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6368648362?page=1#5))<br />
<br />
Account Wide Feedback for PvP Mounts<br />
I don't mind being called out on this. I didn't abandon anything, but I did get caught up in other tasks and didn't get back to you all like I had intended. I apologize for that. It wasn't my intention at all. (Yes, I'm a community manager, not a developer (and a she just for clarity's sake).) <br />
<br />
I've been working behind the scenes a lot lately with the team to get more information out to everyone on a variety of things as well as getting ready for the Mists of Pandaria launch, but I don't intend that to be an excuse.<br />
<br />
A few things just to be clear on the PvP mounts and what I know.<br />
<br />
There was a period of time in the beta in which some PvP mounts were erroneously showing that they couldn't be given/used on other characters. This was a bug that should have been corrected. That bug did not apply to the Gladiator Mount or the Rated Battleground Mount. <br />
<br />
The decision on the Gladiator Mount or Rated Battleground Mounts hasn't changed. The developers still want these to be character specific as they apply to that particular class and season.<br />
<br />
While I didn't respond again, I definitely did carry the feedback to the team. Other PvP mounts you get outside of those should be account-wide as it was originally intended to work that way within the beta.<br />
<br />
That all said, I have no doubt that the developers will continue to assess whether or not this is something they want to change in the future, but this is how it's working for now.<br />
<br />
I do appreciate everyone that took their time to share their feedback whether it was in those threads, twitter, or even via email (yes I got some.)<br />
<br />
Just of note, if there are particular mounts (beyond the Gladiator and Rated Battleground mount) that you're concerned about, feel free to post and let us know. We can always look into them to make sure everything is working &quot;as intended&quot;. <br />
<br />
I know it wasn't the answer you were hoping for, but it's what I have for you at this time. We always reserve the right to change our minds though, so while the answer today is &quot;no&quot; on those mounts, you never know what could happen in the future. <br />
<br />
Believe it or not, we have a lot of people here who love PvP as well (I'm one of them), so while we may not always agree on what that means, please do know we do in fact care about it.

To be fair, they already made BC included for free. I'm hoping that there is a new $20 battle chest that includes WOTLK or Cataclysm soon, but having to buy 4 boxes to get the full game is a bit extreme.</div></div><hr />

No news on the glaring issues of the never ending assault from the Shaman community with the demand that Shocks being pulled from their shared CD, again something I posted about the glaring old mechanics that Shamans are still tied down to. So far, 70% of the crap I have told blizzard has come true, so maybe they realized that if they don't do Shamans right now, more sub lost will come.<br />
<br />
BTW, GW2 people will have fun in 3 days. GL/HF, I won't play it right away, but my cousin will and I think he will have some fun. Also, almost that time for the new patch, get your DL done and also GL/HF as PvP will be horrible with healers never losing any mana and Rogues will stay at 100% with 1 recoup. :p<br />

It's more likely that it's because there's another big release this week. Tera is doing the same thing. Not sure if any other current MMOs are doing similar.</div></div><hr />

Nope, it's because of RAF. This &quot;discount&quot; will ensure that even people who were 'doubting' think &quot;oh man I better get this now before prices go back up so I'd have a shot at r1st monk&quot; or something.</div></div><hr />

Rather have no news than that :P<br />
<br />
The D3 paragon system is a good addition, but I fear it'll be too little too late.<br />
<br />
They are nerfing every class in every patch, be careful of what you wish.<br />
<br />
Oh, and dont get us started on that d3 massive grind system to become god mode, when we are expecting PvP and new boss/difficulty.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
WTF why are you guys nerfing rogues? Its not like we are OP right now anyway why not leave Rogues alone like you have been doing? Not cool.<br />
Because some of your fellow rogues are asking for &quot;change&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think it has as much to do with competition as it is to encourage new subscribers. To my knowledge, this has been done in the week(s) prior to a pre-expansion patch going live (with maybe the exception of TBC).<br />
<br />
So whatever the actual reasoning may be, it's indisputable that getting such a steep discount lowers the entry barrier. :)<br />

The base build is set for 5.0.4 and they don't want to apply more than one patch, so each patch they are releasing now is the same with a few minor changes filewise. <br />

Don't know about you but Ret is fine. And im enjoying Ret as it is. I'll wait til 90 on Live to judge. But Ret is doing amazingly well and as it is my main ill be getting him to 90 and enjoying every second of levelling. I won't rush to 90 but i sure will book time off work to enjoy it all day playing.<br />

Really? You think a guy that is probably making $500,000 per year will break the game balance so that he can have a 5% buff to a spec you think he plays. this guy spends probably 80 hours a week working on the spreadsheet that is ´class balance´.. I highly doubt he has any spec or class that he plays with ´love´ at this point. You can´t be that far into the sausage factory and still enjoy to eat it very much.<br />
<br />
Class balance is fine. The classes on beta in the actual raids are balanced very well, you hear this from multiple top guilds. These last few weeks of nerfs and buffs have been very very small overall nerfs to sustained DPS... and in actuality, it was frost mages that are doing the high DPS now.. fire mages have been on the low end for a few months.<br />

it is called beta testing. They made a change, tested it, didn´t like it, so decided to change it back. THIS IS BETA TESTING!!! you try new things.

Just stfu about BETA BETA BETA, we have seen the same shit in older expansions, mages ALWAYS go live overpowered ALWAYS! Have you seen the PvP forums? HAVE YOU? And PvE wise? LOL! They only real way to check if a class is OP over another is to PvP and see how well they do against other classes, go check the PvP forums if you dare! You mention that frost is doing highest damage now... I wonder why frost is the top now, PvP anyone? Another example, they keep nerfing PvP specs like sub but buff another like frost?! There is your answer right there and have you seen Ghostcrawler being interview about mages, how much he gloats about the class he loves. If not, check them, they are on youtube (speaking of the most recent ones). Another thing, I guess you are not taking part of the huge thread over at the wow forums where theorycrafters and concerned players who know what the fuck they are talking about post endlessly asking Blizzard to acknowledge their wrong doings but to no prevail and only to get &quot;it's fine&quot; comments back. And when people start dissecting blues comments they get suspended for doging so?!<br />
<br />
If you have ignored all this things (or maybe you are just blind as the rest of the sheep), I advice you to check facts before posting &quot;It's just the beta&quot; comments. The things that need to be adresses have been forwarded to Blizzard in many different forms, yet they (he) continue to favor one class over the other. <br />

Funny, I just looked over the beta pvp forums and I saw nothing on the first two pages about mages being OP. Saw a couple of mentions of Hunters being strong and warriors having too much burst. Someone having problems beating shadow priests, and an arcane mage saying they are weak.<br />
<br />
Maybe you should just suck less instead of spending all your time on forums begging for other classes to be nerfed. I also am still waiting for your link showing where GC plays a fire mage as his main? Last I saw him mention was something about a disc priest. It is just very very juvenile to think that a guy making that much money, with so many people working with him, would buff ´his´spec just so he was better at a game. I doubt he even plays the game as a competitive game.<br />
<br />
While I guess it is easy for you to call people a ´sheep´ for thinking class balance is decent, and certainly never favored a single spec throughout the entire history of the game.. I think the reality is more that you just aren´t very good at pvp, so cry against anyone who gets a buff in a beta.</div></div><hr />

No news is good news as far as I'm concerned. Ret is fun to play and our damage is serviceable (if not the best), they gave prot some good buffs to our AOE damage which was the big problem we had with tanking/threat and our active mitigation works pretty damn well so far. I'd rather be in a middle of the pack situation where they don't nerf us to shit after a major patch because we were too good (ret 3.0, prot 4.0) or release us being terrible and buff us later (ret 4.0).<br />

So they thought it needed a buff from 220 to 235, then decided a few days later to nerf it below the original value... WTF? <br />
