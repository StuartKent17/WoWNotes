Anyone know if they're being sensible about open world areas, re: iLvls? It annoys me that a casual can end up with little new content (e.g., Isle of Thunder, Isle of Giants, Timeless Isle, Tanaan Jungle), because they have to keep tuning it to increasingly-geared raiders. I would like it if a new zone would be tuned to a certain iLvl, then players are capped at that iLvl.

<br />
And nearly done with raid testing, PvP work and a few other things. It really does feel more like a Beta than Alpha from what I've played. There's a lot already in there and pretty much done to be honest. They really should start calling it Beta now. Not saying your argument isn't invalid but judging it from one spec only just being added when the idea was to do an entire rework is a bit silly when there is a broad amount of things nearly completed.</div></div><hr />

We should interact with NPCs, not the UI. Yet reading that blip on the world quests, all I'm seeing is:<br />
Once you’ve unlocked World Quests, simply open up your map and look around.<br />
Want to know what there is to do in Azeroth today? Just open your map!<br />
Each day, you’ll receive a new emissary quest which will automatically appear on your map of Broken Isles.<br />
Yay. I get to interact with the map for endgame content instead of NPCs. /sarcasm The game is moving further and further from RPG territory. People complained when Blizzard streamlined vendored to remove their chats before you vendored something. Why are we allowing Blizzard to bypass interactions with NPCs by just putting things on the map? How is the map sentient? How does the map suddenly know where everything is? We don't even talk to an NPC at the start of each day to be told where things are! It just knows. Guess we might as well name the map something and give it eyes that move and have it chat to us randomly because there's not much reason for NPC interaction anymore. The RPG element is quickly vanishing.<br />
<br />
Yes, I've played Diablo. Yes, I'm aware of their adventure system. Yes, I have done some of the adventure quests. I find them boring, tedious, repetitious, and irritating. Oh yay, I get to log on, go hit up random areas for no real reason to do something (kill some rares, take out some totems, etc) and get a reward at the end after I complete like 5 areas. Yeah, that's so entertaining. WHY am I doing it? Oh, because Tyrael told me so ... in like 2 sentences? If Tyrael can be lazy, so can I. I stopped playing Diablo 3.<br />
<br />
I want CONTEXT. Yet Blizzard relying on the map to tell us everything rather than an NPC removes a lot of that context. A few years back, quest writers were apparently begging for more space to write more story. Now they're reduced to 1-2 sentences? While I can understand many don't read the story, it's disappointing Blizzard is doing a 180 and truncating it to a Cliff's note. I'm getting really tired of fill the bar quests and I don't see these &quot;world quests&quot; as being any better.</div></div><hr />

Tbf, no world content has ever been tuned around people in full Heroic/Mythic. It's tuned for the lowest possible gear level of THAT tier and anything above that item level means you feel increasingly powerful. <br />
<br />
At 620 ilvl, players may struggle in Tanaan. At full 650, it becomes a lot easier. At 695 (very doable for casuals) it's trivial.<br />
In a game where better gear and character power takes such a big part, it's only natural if those with the best gear should struggle less thanks to simply being more powerful. I'm also willing to bet that they're going to encourage grouping up for the more challenging world quests, which is only a good thing in an mmorpg.</div></div><hr />

Actually, from what I've seen on the map so far, you ARE being given context, as in a story of what's going on and who's involved...<br />
<br />
Makes perfect sense that scouts are able to report in. How does having points of interest on a map make any less sense RPG-wise than having an npc (with the same voice acting every time) telling us the intell that's PROBABLY still gathered by scouts/spies/observations...?<br />

A phrase I've heard VERY OFTEN over the last couple of expansions has been &quot;welfare epics.&quot; <br />
<br />
Another phrase: &quot;Loot pinata.&quot; Or another: &quot;Monty Haul&quot; (though that's something that older gamers remember...). ESPECIALLY in WoD.<br />
<br />
Raiders went on rants, saying &quot;if you're not doing raids, you don't need raid gear.&quot; And it makes sense. Raids are tuned to higher gear levels (and, especially, split-second timing, group tactics, and knowing the fight), whereas outdoor content should be tuned to the majority who are casuals.<br />
<br />
I mean, unless Blizzard is going to give us gear for just clicking a button? Something that keeps up with content...? That would be in keeping with the trend they've shown in the last couple of expansions. I'm sure we'll reach the point where casuals walking around in Normal-mode current tier raid gear is possible within a couple months of each raid tier being released, without stepping foot into a raid.<br />
<br />
If so, I'm hoping that they include the cool set bonuses and the awesome trinkets this time around. (I mean, hey, if you guys WANT to keep up the &quot;you get raid gear, you get raid gear, EVERYBODY gets raid gear!!!&quot; Blizzard is using to keep the casuals subscribed...?)</div></div><hr />

Yeah. I think this is slightly generational:<br />

For us older farks out there (35+) it is a slight disconnect to go running to a connected device (as our Maps are in WoW) to answer something.

In MoP, we got a few pieces from running early quests in Timeless Isle. Then you had to grind.<br />

In WoD, we got pieces from the mission table, the salvage yard, the treasures laying around the map, a few quests, etc. Then you had to grind. (But at least you REMAINED only a tier or two behind...)<br />

<br />
Yeah. Running to an NPC, or unlocking a quest hub in a region is called &quot;immersion&quot;.<br />
<br />
Immersion seems to be slowly being removed from the game. Because &quot;talking head&quot; quest givers is so much better, amirite?<br />
<br />
More convenient? For the devs, yes. And for the players.<br />
<br />
Does it help maintain immersion? No, it pretty much ignores it. <br />
<br />
It's up to you how important immersion is to an MMO. Me? I think it's kind of important. Plus, this removes the need to explore, since the map does all the exploring for you. I like the start of a new expansion, and the greyed out map, and exploring all the regions to find out what's there - and kill everything there. Wee! Now the map does it for me, and I can just flight straight to an objective with no silly exploring or story. <br />

<br />
Huh? How does world map objectives defeat immersion?<br />
-It's not like it stops you from exploring. Feel free to explore as much as you want. <br />
-It's also something that only comes into effect at lvl 110, when you should have already been exposed to a majority of the content anyway. <br />
-It would be ridiculous if there were numerous, ever-changing quests and you had to run around to multiple places try to find which was active at any given time.<br />

To be fair, by their own logic: You don't need any gear from Mythic Archi because there's nothing harder and you don't NEED it to down any further bosses. I mean, we're talking need, right? So Archi shouldn't drop anything, right? Since you don't need it. Fair is fair.</div></div><hr />

If they were in the world they would have rough spawn times and rough location marks they would never be 100% random. And even if they were someone would make an addon to detect when they are up. And if they wernt random people would just goo to wowhead and type &quot;legion world quests spawns&quot;<br />
<br />
The games changed people have changed and so has the landscape an addon for everything and a google search for everything.<br />
Sure would it be nice if the quests were random? Sure maybe not sure if i could actually care about searching for them.</div></div><hr />

Yeah for sure when you had pkayers going troppo for having little or nothing to do, now Blizz went okay lets give players a lot to do and they still complain, makes one wonder if the players actually know what they want..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolfie of Medivh</div><div class="date">2016-04-14, 05:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah. Running to an NPC, or unlocking a quest hub in a region is called &quot;immersion&quot;.<br />
<br />
Immersion seems to be slowly being removed from the game. Because &quot;talking head&quot; quest givers is so much better, amirite?<br />
<br />
More convenient? For the devs, yes. And for the players.<br />
<br />
Does it help maintain immersion? No, it pretty much ignores it. <br />
<br />
It's up to you how important immersion is to an MMO. Me? I think it's kind of important. Plus, this removes the need to explore, since the map does all the exploring for you. I like the start of a new expansion, and the greyed out map, and exploring all the regions to find out what's there - and kill everything there. Wee! Now the map does it for me, and I can just flight straight to an objective with no silly exploring or story. <br />
<br />
But, hey, they're not dailies, so that's good, right?<br />
<br />
<br />
See, in my mind, it made no sense.<br />
<br />
LEt's take the Shadow-Pan Garrsion in Towlong Steppes as an example. The one near the Temple of Nu'zao.<br />
<br />
There's this big camp of highly trained guards there. They stand around waiting for you to stumble on them, and they give you a bunch of quests every day.<br />
<br />
....<br />
<br />
This makes no sense. If they're so powerful and knowledgeable why am I doing this instead of them? Why are they standing here, giving me gold for doing it? And they have a vendor with expensive items to help them!<br />
<br />
Now let's look at the Garrison table. I have recruited and geared out a bunch of followers. They go out and do things and bring me the gold/items.<br />
<br />
....<br />
<br />
This doesn't make any sense either! if these folks are so powerful they can take on a wing of a raid dungeon why do they need my sterling leadership? Don't ya think they could figure it out?<br />
<br />
So yeah, too far the other way.<br />
<br />
Now, let's look at Legions idea: I send a scout out to find hotspots. They report it back to me on my map, which I can then use to get to the trouble and fix it.<br />
<br />
Now, doesn't that seem a lot more balanced? I have a follower who is specifically set up to do work for me to give me something to do. These things vary so I'm not going to one set geographic spot, and I actually have to go there and do something.<br />
<br />
This seems like the best of both worlds: a good reason to do something, and reason to go out and do it.</div></div><hr />

-It's not like it stops you from exploring. Feel free to explore as much as you want. <br />
-It's also something that only comes into effect at lvl 110, when you should have already been exposed to a majority of the content anyway. <br />
-It would be ridiculous if there were numerous, ever-changing quests and you had to run around to multiple places try to find which was active at any given time.<br />

Also, have you played for the past 3 expansions? Everything has had a generic breadcrumb quest saying &quot;Hey go here&quot; which is no different than a talking head map say &quot;Hey go here.&quot;<br />

<br />
That would be acceptable, but it's been 6 years. How long could it take? They have the old geometry to work from, it wasn't that complex an area. <br />
<br />
It was primarily for druids, they could also have rolled rebuilding it into the druid quests.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Old geometry won't work well, for one it was outdated in terms of texture work before cata upgraded it. That part is minor though, they would also have to shape the exterior, as the old park was just some hallways with literally nothing surrounding it in the old SW. <br />
I can't say how much work that is and what that would mean for other projects they got going on though. But compared to updating an existing area like the harbor with a few already exising objects that they are already using in the game elsewhere, and dotting around some NPCs, rebuilding the park would be a huge undertaking.</div></div><hr />

Think you'll se a lot more details the coming days when people start testing what they are, what kind, what objectives and what rewards, where to go etc. As for faction stories, no idea if they will be faction-wide but I do believe they are adding the same kind of progressing questlines to class/order halls.</div></div><hr />

If I recall correctly, they mentioned quite a while back that they wanted advancing reputations to unlock new questlines with more story at endgame related to the reputation; not sure if they're still going with that.</div></div><hr />

Because they want to do all that stuff for no reason whatsoever. Their problem is that world quests give meaningful rewards. Which is something only hardcore mythic raiders are allowed to have. Or something.<br />
<br />
Also is it just me or was the alliance intro pretty dumb? Greymane was all like: This isn't the Legion I remember fighting. Bro, you were behind your stupid wall last time the Legion attacked. In fact judging by the worgen starting questline Genn was likely sniffing his own butt when the Legion attacked.<br />
But all right the Legion is serious now, so let's send....about a dozen people. Okay. And let's siege cities and attack endless armies on foot. What? Airstrikes with some bombs? Steam tanks and other armed vehicles? Ain't nobody got time for that.<br />
<br />
Didn't Anduin say that his father was a master strategist? All he did was zerg rush with far too few people.<br />
<br />
I wonder what the Horde did this time. Sometimes I really wonder what was the point in making the Horde a playable faction if they always end up being the bad guys.</div></div><hr />

Oh yeah, and I look really forward to that.<br />
<br />
My biggest criticism with WoD was how it threw out the baby with the bathwater when it came to MoP style dailies and storytelling, so one of my main hopes for Legion was for factions to get another evolving storyline that opens up as you progress them. Finding out each CLASS gets that as well is very exciting, and also slightly concerning since I literally want to see all of it so I'll need to maintain ever spec in game game (since Artifacts are also apparently getting more lore as you level them up, unless it's not on a per-spec basis).<br />

We had a very clear compelling powerful story. In our raids and dungeons we kind of touched on where that story ended up. In terms of bridging the gap between those while we were telling that story, it was often in a way that felt disconnected from the world itself. Kind of fragmented. We’re really trying to much better integrate that storytelling in game so there’s a clear plotline that players can follow from start to finish.<br />

Some sample objectives were things like &quot;Kill (named mob) and 11 (named mob's trash)&quot;, or &quot;Collect X items and kill 5 (named mob's trash&quot;, supposedly allowing the same area to be used for different objectives that evoke old-fashioned daily quests more than &quot;fill this bar by whatever is the quickest method&quot;, so I wouldn't really say they are bonus objectives in any sense other than you travel to the location and the objectives will pop up (at least this time they seem more Quest-y and have lore...)<br />

Ahhh :/ Well, still. In Legion we're getting spec-specific lore in Artifact acquisition and Artifact progression, Class lore in the Class Order Halls and Order Hall Campaigns, profession lore from freakin' professions and random objective lore from World Quests.

<br />
Can't say much for what the future holds but the way they are designing quests in Legion makes it look like they want to take storytelling to the next level. Classes have their own campaign / story line, unless things have changed that goes for professions as well. Having only accepted my first quest in alpha I can't say much about the latter. I would be very surprised if coming content patches, heck even the main release wouldn't have some faction-based campaign as well.</div></div><hr />

I have to agree on this. Also make them ever evolving in some way each patch if you want to keep them relevant reward wise through Legion. Hell make 1 into a mini side story if possible.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like at launch it will be over 300 and if it proves fun it would be something that in theory would be pretty easy to add many more each patch as most won't require any major art or level design type delays just standard quest hookups.</div></div><hr />

That is exactly what they are. It is simply a paint job.</div></div><hr />

We think of going to a person or a stationary device like a library or a computer. We don't always think to go to that thing in our pockets. Given the younger ages of many of WoW's designers, I can imagine it's quite simple to them where to put this info.<br />
<br />
Please don't profile me. I'll be 38 in a few weeks, and I ABSOLUTELY run to my electronic device for answers. I have made a concious effort to stay with the times instead of insisting that &quot;in my day&quot; things were better. They weren't. Its better now, it should be better now. If we aren't getting better, then wtf are we doing? <br />
<br />
Get with the times, or be left in the past. Its lonely there, the dinosaurs are extinct. Don't be a dinosaur.</div></div><hr />

TO ALL OF YOU WHO THINK THAT YOU CHOOSE THE QUESTS FROM THE MAP, there will be LEGION FACTION EMMISARIS (NPCs) in our Order Halls that we have to talk to get the quests.<br />

The last part of that video is more of what I was expecting, but the rest is a bit sparse. I understand it might be a technical limitation or to make it more playable for people with slower PCs, but an option to make Broken Shore feel even more like a claustrophobic war zone would be cool to see.</div></div><hr />

I mean at least its not as silly and Disney-esque as that WoD intro... but that writing. Do you even try? Or are you devs having your kids write this shit? Such terrible dialogue. And when the fuck did Genn ever fight the Legion before? Not to mention the checklist of bad Blizzard writing:<br />
<br />
1) Bad guy always mentioning his master<br />
2) Unknown badguy being a badass but dying right away<br />
3) Badguy(s) back from the dead! REVENGE!<br />
4) Finally, blame the horde/Alliance.<br />
<br />
Wish I hadn't wasted a half hour on this shit. Coulda been using it to get better light gear in Destiny or finishing a GTA:O daily objective. Think today is my 28th... mmm half million dollar daily.<br />

<br />
Are you sure, the post made it sound like we simply check our maps and then we can go straight there without talking to anyone or going to any hubs.<br />
<br />
&quot;First, you don’t have to head to a daily quest hub to gather up quests. Once you’ve unlocked World Quests, simply open up your map and look around. You will see a variety of things to do, including which loot and reputation gains you can earn from each activity. You’ll plan your adventure, then head out into the wilds.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Emissaries are the representatives of the major factions in Legion. Each day, you’ll receive a new emissary quest which will automatically appear on your map of Broken Isles.&quot;<br />
<br />
World Quests sound pretty cool though, I like the idea of just checking the map to find quests and things to do instead of having daily hubs.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolfrick</div><div class="date">2016-04-15, 06:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not in the Alpha but I have talked to someone who are, and as I understood it, there is not 1 quest hub for an entire zone, all the quest giver are spread out in the zone, so you interact with an NPC, but the NPCs are spread out in the world, I think that blizzard want to emphasise that it will not be the same as &quot;mist of pandaria DAILY QUEST hubs&quot; which was so hated by the whiners (Whiners Brigade)<br />
<br />
If you ask me, I liked the Daily quest hubs, I think there should be a balance of everything, but the World quests are awesome and is a very cool new fecture that can be Expanded on.</div></div><hr />
