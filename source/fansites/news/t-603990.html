2.4 Patch 
We're getting closer to 2.4, but we're not ready to get into too many particulars as of yet. We'll do what we can though to keep everyone in the loop as much as possible. (Source)

2.4 Patch<br />
We're getting closer to 2.4, but we're not ready to get into too many particulars as of yet. We'll do what we can though to keep everyone in the loop as much as possible. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2366554981&amp;postId=36863170558&amp;sid=1#144))<br />

Nerubians<br />
You won't see them as a playable race in Wrath of the Lich King. They do have a compelling story to their race however and you may get to experience more of it. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3547883610&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=1#6)) (Nerubian on WoWWiki (http://www.wowwiki.com/Nerubian))<br />

Improving the graphic engine<br />
Could we? Most likely so. But that would mean limiting who could play the game. We also enjoy the style that we have and while we continue to make improvements, want to be very careful in how we go about doing it so that we can allow people to play without the need of needing to do massive upgrades.

Reminder - Free character transfers<br />
Small reminder, if you plan to move your character from one of the high population realms, this is your last day. <br />
We will be offering free character moves from selected high population realms to other, lower populated realms to assist in population dispersal. The ability to move a character on the selected source realms will become available on Friday, December 21 at 12:01 PM PST, and are scheduled to run until Friday, December 28 at 12:01 PM PST.<br />
<br />
In the event that a realm meets our transfer goals before the scheduled end date, the transfers to that realm will be disabled. We highly recommend that if you are planning to transfer that you do so at your earliest convenience.<br />
<br />
Once the transfers open you can begin your transfer by visiting the Character Move page located here: https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/account/character-move.html (https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/account/character-move.html)<br />
<br />
The realms chosen consist of source realms with the highest sustained queues, and destination realms with the lowest population. The numbers gathered are directly from our data, and depict the realms in most need of these transfers. We will be continuing to monitor all realms and open additional free transfers in the future where necessary.<br />

Addon - GlowFoSho<br />
The post about Cartographer_Route yesterday was fairly popular, so here is another one ! This time I'll talk about GlowFoSho, actually it won't take long because this mod is very, very simple.<br />
<br />
What does it do ?<br />
Adds a small &quot;Enchantment&quot; menu at the top right of your dressing room and ... let you preview all the enchantments of the game on your weapons. That's it !<br />
<br />
Download<br />
As usual you can get it on WoWAce.com (http://files.wowace.com/GlowFoSho/GlowFoSho.zip)<br />
