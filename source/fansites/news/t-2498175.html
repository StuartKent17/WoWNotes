Items<br />
<br />
Heart of Azeroth<br />
<br />
Purification Protocol’s (Essence) Rank 2 Major Power’s effect no longer causes an annihilated enemy to trigger Bolstering, Bursting, or Sanguine affix effects when it dies.<br />
The Well of Existence (Essence) now becomes stealthed when its wielder enters stealth (e.g. Druids’ Prowl or Rogues’ Shroud of Concealment).<br />
Vision of Perfection (Essence) no longer grants Guardian Druids with its Minor Power’s Rank 2 healing effect at Rank 1.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue that prevented some players from receiving a Call to Arms Distinction after completing the weekly “Call to Arms” quests.<br />
The amount of Construction Project materials needed for “Cogfrenzy’s Construction Frenzy” has been reduced. Additionally, purchasing access to the Charging Station from Flux now fills 50% of the quest completion bar.<br />
Increased the damage of Lord Hydraxis and decreased the health and damage of Zan’jir Scaleguards in “Lords of Water”. The length of the time to complete the quest has been adjusted.<br />
Fixed a bug where Deepwater Maw sometimes didn’t spawn when using the Hundred-Fathom Lure during “Let’s Fish”.<br />
Clockwork Giants can now be scanned by multiple players in “The Other Place”.</div></div><hr />

Still they give 100xp for a 3 days mission.<br />
They should fix this too ( from 450 to 1000xp, depends the possibility to lower the time needed ).</div></div><hr />
