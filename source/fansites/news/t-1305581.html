Darkmoon Faire Cross-Realm Zone<br />
It looks like the Darkmoon Faire now has the Cross-Realm Zone feature turned on, resulting in many more people there when you visit now! You can take part in some discussion about it here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1305353-Get-off-my-island!-DMF-is-CRZ-d).<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Character / Items<br />
Greg, what will happen to ch.mode gear when the new exp. hits? Would be a shame if all these cool sets became unobtainable.<br />
They don't strictly need to be unobtainable. If the dungeons keep scaling you down, the challenge will still be there. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338367292272427010))<br />
Though to be honest, we're not sure yet what our actual solution will be. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338367407649353729))<br />
<br />
Will items be something like Bloodsoaked instead of Thunderforged in 5.4?<br />
Yes. Assuming we do it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338027120771076096))<br />
<br />
On a side note, will we ever see Progression-Paths outside of Gear for Characters at Max-Level?<br />
We would like to, but we have to come up with good systems. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/337004333071740928))<br />
<br />
could you elaborate on the valor vendor going away in 5.4. That could be punishing to those still a tier behind or more<br />
But we do like having a place you can earn gear even if you don't want to raid. I just didn't want to announce that content yet. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/336599620979421184))<br />
I don't think GC meant that the older valor vendors are going away. Just that you won't have new ones. Right?<br />
The older ones won't go away and we don't know if there will be new ones or not. It's just an idea at this stage. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/336998576615997440))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
What's the objection with returning AV back to where it was a few years ago where epic battles could have lasted hours?<br />
The problem is some players don't want a very long BG. We've discussed making long BGs their own thing.... (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335805077153529856))<br />
<br />
Disabling auto follow in Battle Grounds has only hurt the multi boxer.<br />
The problem is when multi boxers are having fun in PvP, everyone else often is not. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322396622594125824))<br />
The biggest issue is that this change has utterly destroyed a play style that has been accepted for 8 year's!!<br />
Nevertheless, do you think it was fun for the solo players on the receiving end? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/333297259028557824))<br />
<br />
Why isn't PvP gear upgradable? This is driving me away from pvp...I can't just jump into a raid in pvp gear and be hit capped<br />
It takes a lot of Conquest gear just to purchase your gear. We didn't want you to also have to upgrade it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/337302249317478401))<br />
<br />
Patch 5.3 PvP Changes<br />
Blue post says new players get discouraged cuz of gear difference in pvp. But getting one shot in FULL boa by prot warr is OK<br />
Low level Shield Slam was fixed in 5.3. To be fair, while low level still matters, far more players care about 90 PvP balance. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335802257029357569))<br />
<br />
PVP power gems are useless in PVP atm compared to a STR gem please explain why or is it blizzards hate towards PVP showing<br />
Strength is still a PvP stat. Why does that offend you? I can understand why PvE gear would. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335793665282809857))<br />
<br />
What's the point of the nerf to PvP stats?<br />
Getting e.g. a Conq weapon made a huge swing in damage. We want gear progression but not huge swings. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335793334289313795))<br />
<br />
thx to ur stupid decision cancelling pvp resilience. i am afk . byebye wow.<br />
You understand, I hope, that we're trying to improve the experience when players in vastly different gear try to PvP. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/333300634608611329))<br />
Why even have gear in pvp? Seems counterintuitive, pvp is about action, not long-term planning gear.<br />
Getting rewards is fun. Without power based progression goals we don't think many players would stick with it for long. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335228553694167040))<br />
Some might, just as some raiders raid just to see the fights, not to earn gear. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335228663467483137))<br />
<br />
in 5.3 pve ganked tanks are FAR better than pvp geared tanks for RBG.. they dont need pvp power, defensive stats better. why?<br />
We don't want anyone, not even tanks, to be super hard to kill as FCs. It's not fun for anyone. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335230597519781889))<br />
<br />
why do you always treat PVP players as 2nd class in wow, bg's are broken,bots run rampant,and pvp nerfs in 5.3, please fix pvp<br />
Look at the list of 5.3 changes. Ask yourself how many were PvE vs PvP fixes. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335225270996979712))<br />
<br />
http://t.co/KveNIAuLKx Read that please and write back your thoughts on it please<br />
Feel like we have addressed this a bunch. PvPers told us they wanted PvP to be more about skill and less about gear. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338372434711433216))<br />
PvE'ers told us they would participate more in PvP if they didn't die immediately until they had better gear. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338372546372182017))<br />
Letting someone use PvE gear as *starter* gear in PvP (and vice versa) allows more crossover and gives you more opponents. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338372701800517632))<br />
<br />
Funny how you guys didn't care about ppl getting smashed in PvP until just recently. Why is that?<br />
Mostly, player feedback. We were worried it was driving folks out of PvP. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338371252089655296))<br />
<br />
what is the point of pvp gear now? Lack of blizz responses is discouraging. Pvp gear =no point. The community wants a response<br />
The community (or at least part of it) asked vociferously for PvP gear to matter less in PvP to allow for catch-up. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/337263546633158656))<br />
yeah pvp gear is a joke. No point in even buying it. Just afk in LFR and u can beat someone in full pvp<br />
By &quot;full pvp&quot; do you mean Honor or Conquest? Conquest, no way. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/337990190029225984))<br />
Sure, but what about honor gear? 20 item level deficit vs. LFR gear is a lot for PvP power to overcome post-nerf.<br />
If you'd rather LFR to get gear instead of Honor gear, that seems fine. You'll want to graduate to Conquest either way. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338042808868933633))<br />
Honor gear is pretty much catch up gear. If you PvP seriously, you'll earn some Conquest. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338042656074645504))<br />
Intuitively, Random Battlegrounds giving worse PvP rewards than doing LFR doesn't seem &quot;fine&quot; to me, but I see your pt<br />
You can run BGs as much as you want but raids once a week (or so). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338119011428610049))<br />
But at the same time, when a new season comes serious PVP'ers &quot;must&quot; LFR to stay ahead (aka not get behind)<br />
You can earn all your Honor gear in a week or two depending on how much you play. LFR is nowhere near that generous. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338367011052728320))<br />
<br />
My level 85 alts only have 40% baseline resilience still, not 65%. Intended?<br />
Yes, the 65% was for level 90. Lower characters will have less. Partially that's because there is still resilience gear at 85. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/337005595687284736))<br />

Computers - Setup of the Month (by chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud))<br />
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud) will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
The current SSD prices (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/june/ssdgraph.gif) are stable, with almost all SSDs under $1 per gigabyte when on sale. No new GPUs worth waiting for are expected before the third quarter this year. RAM prices have been increasing for the past few months, so if you were thinking about adding RAM anytime soon, now is the time.<br />
<br />
The new Haswell CPUs from Intel are here (http://www.anandtech.com/show/7003/the-haswell-review-intel-core-i74770k-i54560k-tested/1) and they offer a ~10% performance increase over the previous generation of CPUs in most applications. They run a little bit on the warmer side, so depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VKVZ1A?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002VKVZ1A) or H90 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B4OCWDE?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00B4OCWDE). <br />
<br />
Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 4770K and should spend that money elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date.<br />

For Warcraft, I would love to see something like maybe a miniature King Arthur pet. Give it special abilities such as a cleave, Excalibur strike, and maybe Knights of the Round where miniature knights sworm the opponent. Of course due a healing ability like Holy light or maybe Lady of the Lake where she rises up and casts a heal on him.</div></div><hr />

I agree, however, if you want to get the 12 DMF trinkets it can fuck riiiiiiiiiiight off. The amount of work against so many players for such a terrible reward is baffling.</div></div><hr />

Call it Mini Ghom or Lil'Ghom etc. The pet could eat another pet whole for a round or two and also cause damage to the pet as well as heal Lil'Ghom. Also Lil'Ghom could release &quot;gas&quot; clouds or one big cloud over the entire group of rival pets, causing them damage over the course of a few rounds. Like the boss in D3, Lil'Ghom could release one or two adds for added damage. He could be considered a beast or demonic type of pet. I think this would be a good idea for people that play D3 and WoW, make it an award from an achievement in D3 that can cross over to WoW.</div></div><hr />

Unless you turn on the computer, play games, and then turn it off you will spend time at idle. I would wager that most people spend a lot of time with their CPU in the lower power states.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The point isn't power consumption on your electric bill. Who cares how much the computer costs to run with the TV, stereo, microwave, hair curler, phone chargers, etc etc etc running. <br />
<br />
The point is the extra power under load that creates extra heat. Heat can be directly related to computer life and for a processor that makes more of it, at more cost with little extra gain in performance, it's probably not worth it. When an i5 3570k gets 60 + fps in every game on the market for $25-30 less at a lower temperature who cares about the extra 6 fps the new chip gets?</div></div><hr />

I'm not hardcore into lvling up through PvP but I do like to alternate between dungeon and BG as I lvl up. Lower lvl brackets are utter chaos right now. Whatever balance was there has been completely obliterated, warrior shield slam has not been fixed at all as far as I can tell.

And nowhere in the PVP community did I ever see them ask for these changes. All of these PVP changes were things the PVE crowd wanted, and the things the PVP crowd wanted they addressed multiple times and Blizzard has yet to even touch upon them. They answer questions about them and say they want to fix it, but not once have they ever made any steps in taking that direction. I don't understand changing a part of the game for people that do not even play that part of the game, instead of changing it for the people that actually play it. Do they just want the PVP community to leave or something? And before someone gets all &quot;Yeah the PVP community in this game is awful I hate them I want them to leave&quot;, they are just apart of the game as anyone else is, and I think their requests should at least be heard and possibly addressed. How many times have PVE things been changed for PVP? That should not happen, and they should avoid pitting the communities against each other in this way.</div></div><hr />

So I'd design a labrador, or maybe a german sheperd, with some distinct canine abilities:<br />
1. Fetch - A two round ability. First round, a ball is thrown at the opposing team. Second round, the dog goes out to fetch it, damaging all foes.<br />
2. Play dead - The dog plays dead, avoiding all damage on the following round.<br />
3. Infinite Cuteness - The dog puts on &quot;puppy eyes&quot;, charming the opponent pet and incapacitatintg them for one round.<br />
4. Bite - Kinda goes without saying...<br />
5. Bark (or maybe Howl) - The dog barks, increasing critical strike chance by 25%.<br />
6. Lick Wounds - Yes, used on hunter pets, same idea, the dog licks itself, healing for a given value.<br />
<br />
I'd definately want one of those!</div></div><hr />

I do think that PvE gear should scale down to either 476 rather than 496, though, or at least somewhere in-between the two, to account for PvP Power. I think the excuses for not doing so are pretty weak. PvP is my favourite part of the game, but like many other PvPers I don't like Arena at all, and I don't play with enough people to do RBGs, so Conquest acquisition for me is slow. I don't really think that it's fair that PvE gear is still better than mine, when PvP is my chosen path for the game, but the only methods of gaining serious amounts of Conquest points are either unpalatable or difficult to arrange. All of my Conquest comes from random BG wins and IoT dailies.</div></div><hr />

A GTX 670 is a unicorn?? not a 780 or titan or 690 or SLI / crossfire? <br />
Also as a 770 (slightly faster 680) is now released and at $400, why would you be still suggesting a 670?<br />
<br />
And then there is the SSD. 128GB or Intel 335?<br />
Unicorn should be 256GB 840Pro / vertex4 / Neutron GTX / Inetl 520 in raid 0 (ok possibly not raid for average users) but definitely a larger drive<br />
<br />
And then there is the case suggestions. for about the same price you have awesome cases like the NZXT 630 or Corsar 600t and they are mid range cases<br />
<br />
And a 750W PSU.. wow, really? 550 is plenty for that system and 750 is JUST enough for SLI (with room to OC) AX860 or better should be in unicorn.<br />
<br />
No AIO cooler options?<br />
<br />
Plz ohh plz sort out the advice your giving out.. No high res options, no multi-screens.. <br />
Whether or not you need a new price bracket is up to you but your narwhal is more like the spec's for unicorn (max the game out on a single 1080 / 1200 screen) and unicorn should be just that.. rare, top end, multi-screen / 3d /high res and sli etc.<br />

Thats just plain lazyness on your part, he's suggesting a builds for certain performance / price brackets, it's still going to be the same build in EU just with your local prices.<br />

<br />
It should look like &quot;brain&quot; (magic type) with stats low hp, low power and high speed only.<br />
The abilities available:<br />
<br />
1) bright idea<br />
-- hits for X damage, 100% chance to hit<br />
-- gives 25% haste (team) buff<br />
-- additional Y damage, if sunny weather<br />
<br />
10) dark thoughts<br />
-- hits for X damage, 100% chance to hit<br />
-- deals additional X damage if goes second<br />
-- additional Y damage, if dark weather<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2) prediction<br />
-- for next 3 turns, all damage taken is considered as &quot;weak&quot;<br />
-- always goes first<br />
-- 3 turns cd<br />
<br />
15) alter events<br />
-- gives pet double haste buff and +100% damage taken debuff for 2 turns<br />
-- then swap all pet's buffs &amp; debuffs with opponent's pet ones<br />
-- 3 turns cd<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
4) imitation<br />
-- opponent's pet next ability is performed (in the same turn) if possible (not stunned, etc.)<br />
-- always goes second<br />
-- 3 turns cd<br />
<br />
20) confusion<br />
-- summons 3 copies of itself<br />
-- each represents chance to miss (opponent's pet ability target is selected randomly from pet &amp; copies)<br />
-- if copy takes any damage, it's removed (if no damage was dealt, one copy is removed anyway)<br />
-- any damage taken by the pet itself will dismiss all copies left (eg. previously poisoned, burning, ..) and deals X damage per copy removed this way<br />
-- 5 turns cd<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Anyone with limitless budget can go to a store, drop five grand on the table and say &quot;build me the best PC you can for that&quot;, but that's beside the point. 95% of PC gamers wont ever game on multiple monitors, so who really cares for pricing on that, if you want to do that, you can easily find out yourself. <br />
<br />
Nobody needs a GeForce Titan either, regarding GPU everything past $350 mark is serious enthusiast material, and is once again not interesting for majority of people who want to build a gaming PC. If you haven't realized by now, those listed builds aren't focused around the who can spend the most money, but get the best bang for your bucks, granted there might be leeway for discussions of what is the best and what not in that price range, but seriously, don't bring a Titan into the discussion when the whole setup he listed costs $1000, exactly the same as the mentioned GPU.<br />
<br />
You know that this is not build the most expensive PC, but mearly a guideline to a powerful gaming PC right? Because if you want a Titan in there, maybe throw in another 4TB of SSDs, that will also bump up the price niceley by about $8.000, but why stop there, just throw in something other that is expensive. <br />
<br />
Also, A dedicated sound card is like completely wasted on again 95% of PC gamers. I played Quake 3 competitively back in the day (CPL, ESL, CBEC etc.), a game that is based on sound and identifying where it's coming from, and I tell you that recent on-board sound cards are more than enough if not great for anything gaming/music/video playback related.</div></div><hr />

Pve - Broken!<br />
<br />
Game - Broken!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Like this game will last 3 more years until Titan are released??? I don´t think so!!!<br />
If they finally decided to remake Titan. Why on hell would they do it with less developers than before? Wouldn´t that just take even more time to remake the game then? GJ Blizzard in making Titan another Diablo 3!!! Blizzard´s era is finally over as the best game developer there is. Now they only got 1 good game atm and that´s SC2. How the hell could you be so stupid???</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chaud</div><div class="date">2013-06-03, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">GTX 670 is a unicorn?? not a 780 or titan or 690 or SLI / crossfire? <br />
Also as a 770 (slightly faster 680) is now released and at $400, why would you be still suggesting a 670?<br />
<br />
Yes, because that is the best GPU at that price point. If you want to spend more, you likely already know what you are doing and don't need a list. The 770s are all OOS or cost $480+ on Amazon right now. <br />
<br />
<br />
Unicorn should be 256GB 840Pro / vertex4 / Neutron GTX / Inetl 520 in raid 0 (ok possibly not raid for average users) but definitely a larger drive<br />
RAID 0 for SSDs is amazing overkill, again if someone really needed it they wouldn't be reading this list. It is common sense that if you want a bigger drive, you can buy one. Many people would benefit from the larger 2-4TB mechanical drives as well, but changing to one requires you to search for a 2-4TB version. It isn't asking too much of someone to think about how much they want to store and buy the right size drive. <br />
<br />
<br />
And then there is the case suggestions. for about the same price you have awesome cases like the NZXT 630 or Corsar 600t and they are mid range cases<br />
There are a ton of nice cases that could easily fill a list of 30, but I had to pick two.<br />
<br />
<br />
And a 750W PSU.. wow, really? 550 is plenty for that system and 750 is JUST enough for SLI (with room to OC) AX860 or better should be in unicorn.<br />
If someone wants to add in a top of the line card later, it allows for that. If someone wants to SLI, they don't need this list.<br />
<br />
<br />
No AIO cooler options?<br />
If someone is overclocking to the limit and they will benefit from the small advantage that gives, they already know what is out there. <br />
<br />
<br />
Plz ohh plz sort out the advice your giving out.. No high res options, no multi-screens.. <br />
Whether or not you need a new price bracket is up to you but your narwhal is more like the spec's for unicorn (max the game out on a single 1080 / 1200 screen) and unicorn should be just that.. rare, top end, multi-screen / 3d /high res and sli etc.<br />
I don't need a new price bracket, because the top end one will max out games at 1080p for the most part. If you want gimmicky 3D or SLI builds, you don't need a list to help you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ignis's Furnace - Elemental - Drops from Ignis the Furnace Master in Ulduar. It is a little furnace on legs that walks around with you. (Also provides unique ability, able to be used as a camp fire.) <br />
<br />
Abilities::<br />
1.) Burn - 90% Hit Chance <br />
<br />
Blasts the enemy with fire, dealing 472 Elemental damage.<br />
<br />
2.) Flamethrower - 100% Hit Chance <br />
<br />
Turns the battlefield into a raging inferno, dealing 295 Elemental damage.<br />
<br />
Fire continues to Burn the enemy dealing 98 Elemental damage each round for 2 rounds.<br />
<br />
3.) Conflagrate - 4 Round Cooldown<br />
95% Hit Chance <br />
<br />
Deals 591 Elemental damage.<br />
<br />
Deals 197 Elemental additional damage if the target is Burning .<br />
<br />
4.) Flame Jets - 90% Hit CHance, 3 Round Cooldown<br />
<br />
Stomps the ground causing geysers of flame to erupt under all enemies. These geysers deal 315 elemental damage.<br />
<br />
5.) Cauterize - 3 Round Cooldown<br />
Restores 394 health plus half of the last hit taken by the user.<br />
<br />
6.) Hot Pocket - Charges and grabs a random enemy target, tossing them into the caster's slag pot. The target is unable to attack the caster and takes 450 Elemental damage every Round for 2 Rounds. If the target survives, they are imbued with the magical slag, increasing their haste by 20% for 3 seconds. (I know it was called Slag Pot for the boss, but the achievement for it is a much cooler name.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Disabling auto follow in Battle Grounds has only hurt the multi boxer.<br />
The problem is when multi boxers are having fun in PvP, everyone else often is not. (Source)<br />
The biggest issue is that this change has utterly destroyed a play style that has been accepted for 8 year's!!<br />
Nevertheless, do you think it was fun for the solo players on the receiving end? (Source)&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Blue post says new players get discouraged cuz of gear difference in pvp. But getting one shot in FULL boa by prot warr is OK<br />
Low level Shield Slam was fixed in 5.3. To be fair, while low level still matters, far more players care about 90 PvP balance. (Source)&quot;<br />
<br />
So different scenarios, but same problem: due to an unbalance somebody is having more fun than the other, but one is wrong and the other is ok. The warrior in full boa is fine if he can 2 or 3 shot any toon, but the multiboxer is not allowed to 2 or 3 shot players through 2+ (upwards of 40) characters he macros together. Both are unpleasant for the player on the losing end, and hella fun for the winner.<br />
<br />
Make up your mind Blizzard.<br />
<br />
On a side note I never thought I'd ever see the day when multiboxing would be discouraged without explicitly making it illegal. $$ and subs talk but apparently not anymore.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Katula</div><div class="date">2013-06-03, 11:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In light of the news that Blizzard might be doing more Battle pet in wrath, I would base my idea onto that. Thus one of my favorite lore and boss encounters within the game is Malygos in the Eye of Eternity <br />
<br />
Name: Mini Malygos<br />
Pet type: Dragonkin<br />
Ability one: Arcane breath. Blasts foe for X amount of arcane damage, dealing 2% more damage each turn for one turn<br />
Ability two: Arcane shield: Shield Mini Malygos in arcane, reducing damage for one turn by 100%. two turn cool down<br />
Ability three: Ice Breath: Blast target with a force of arcanic ice for X amount of damage (less than arcane breath) slowing targets speed by 25% for three turns.<br />
<br />
Ability four: Mana bomb: Form a mana bomb that detonates after two turns, dealing X (more than ability one) amount of damage to all active battle pets. Two turn cool down<br />
Ability five: Dragon roar: Let forth a bellowing roar, silencing two turn attacks and dealing minor damage. Increases damage taken by target by 5% three turn cool down<br />
Ability five: Boon of the the blue dragon flight: Increases damage done by 25% for two turns. Five turn cool down.<br />
<br />
This is my rough idea for what I would like to see. Of course I dare say ability would be re-used if there indeed was such a battle pet. But hey! It's all a bit of fun, right? Right? WRONG!! Give me a baby MALLY! ;_;</div></div><hr />

<br />
It would have the skin of one of those &quot; troll slimes &quot; kinda like the one that drops off of an AQ boss, but it would have the Skull of a reptile in the top of it instead of a troll skull and would change colors slowly, like the new Camiliien flying mount when idle.<br />
<br />
It's name would be<br />
Metamorphic Slime-ling - lvl 1 , Undead = Passive : Undead pets return to life immortal for one round when killed. 150HP , 15Atak , 10Speed<br />
<br />
It's abilities would be Elemental , Undead . and would be prone to high dmg from Critters abilities . 50% and low dmg from Dragonkin abilities . 33%<br />
<br />
------------------------------------<br />
First Tie r: at lvl 1<br />
<br />
Elemental, Learn-able at lvl 1 , 90% Hit Chance:<br />
Slime Spew - Slimes the Enemy pet with a toxic sludge causing 25dmg and ticking for 5 Elemental dmg over 3 rounds. High dmg to Humanoid , Low dmg to Aquatic<br />
<br />
Undead, Learn-able at lvl 10,90% Hit Chance:<br />
Hunger - The Slime - ling pulls the Enemy pet into it's body Ingesting it , causing 30dmg for 2 rounds. Applying the 'Ingesting' effect. High dmg to Mechanical , Low dmg to Critter<br />
<br />
------------------------------------<br />
Second Tier : at lvl 2<br />
<br />
Undead, Learn-able at lvl 2 , 100% Hit Chance:<br />
Coagulate - Coagulates the Slime-ling into a hardened state lowering dmg taken by 50% for 3 rounds. 4 round CD.<br />
<br />
Undead , Learn-able at lvl 15 , 85 % Hit Chance :<br />
Ingesting Slime - Coats the Enemy pet in Ingesting Slime slowing eating it alive Restoring 20 Health to the Slime-ling and eating 20 health from the enemy pet for 4 rounds. Does Double healing if the Enemy pet is 'Ingesting'. 2 round CD, High dmg to Humanoid, Low dmg to Aquatic<br />
<br />
------------------------------------<br />
Therd Teir : at lvl 4<br />
<br />
Elemental , Learn-able at lvl 4, 100% Hit Chance:<br />
Forced Evolution - The Slime-ling Force Evolves it self into a higher organism over 2 rounds. Taking the first to Stimulate growth then on the 2nd Evolving adding 65dmg to each attack for 2 rounds. 4 round CD , High dmg to Mechanical, Low dmg to Critter<br />
<br />
<br />
Magic, Learn-able at lvl 20 , 100% Hit chance:<br />
Metamorphose - Take on the Enemy pet's look and abilities for 4 rounds increasing dmg dealt by 20% of the Slime-ling's health and adding awareness to there opponent's attacks for 2 rounds. after Morph wears off the extra awareness causes a 10% increased Dodge chance to the attacks used while in Metamorphose. 4 round CD, High dmg to Flying, Low dmg to Mechanical<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, Points taken on some things and I did say that maybe you need a new price point rather than replacing the one you have BUT I'm a member of a hardware forum and about half of the people coming to us for advice ARE looking for either 120hz screens or multi-monitor set-ups.. really with the price and performance of hardware these days there is little reason not to when a 2k computer (that a few years ago would only run 1 screen) can now run 3, High res or 120fps..<br />
<br />
And sorry but you need to look in better places if you think you can only get 770's at that price.<br />
<br />
pcpartpicker.com/parts/video-card/#c=137&amp;sort=a5<br />
<br />
Also on the SSD's, whats the point in going for a 120GB drive when you want all your games / apps to load fast.. have you seen the size of just wow these days..<br />
I it's just the name and inconsistency in your suggestions that piss me off with these, Unicorn does not describe what your putting under the hardware.<br />
<br />
And if your trying to stick to a budget then why are you spec'ing out a 4770k which most people will never use the potential of either in multi-core computing or in overclocking?<br />
Why are you specing a PSU that is WAY beyond whats needed for the build?<br />
<br />
Lower budget, better build:<br />
pcpartpicker.com/p/12Liz<br />
Slap in cooler of choice, anything between $30 and 100, still under your budget but will play games better..<br />
Ohh and reasoning on the Ivy chip is $30 difference for marginal performance and increased power.. and like you said, anyone needing these suggestions will need an easier time of it and Ivy is MUCH easier to overclock.. and if they aren't overclocking then your doing them a dis-service by suggesting a k series chip and large cooler in the first place<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Sensible 2k build for multi-screen / high res / 120hz monitors..:<br />
pcpartpicker.com/p/12Lpj<br />
Swap the 2x770's for a single 780 if you rather stay to 1 card.. but it's much better bang for buck with the 770's.<br />
<br />
You don't have to break any banks to go for big power, you also don't have to spend as much as your suggesting for better in game performance.<br />
Feel free to drop in AMD cards wherever suits though they suck big donkey N*** for wow.. Also feel free to drop in Asus, gigabyte Asrock whatever boards / cards is each persons preference.. I Like MSI at the mo, great bang for buck and very good customer support.<br />
<br />
To anyone else that was saying anything about me over spec'ing.. My grievance was calling it a unicorn.. That and mixing a 670 in when a 770 is a far better investment and a 750W gold rated PSU where it wasn't needed etc etc.<br />

We only list Amazon prices. Of course people going to a hardware forum want high end stuff, but we aren't really a hardware forum. Most people requesting build help here are spending $1k or less.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well thats just plain silly. Any specific reason?<br />
<br />
Even if you used something like pcpartpicker, like I have it will list amazon and a few others, not a comprehensive list at all but only amazon?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I was ranting a bit (and didn't mean to cause offence, if any was taken) but there are a few inconsistencies in your builds (as stated, not to mention a $50 mouse and IPS monitor(albeit a good price for one) in your puppy peripherals section)<br />
<br />
P.S, the review linked with the 335 SSD is actually the 330.. they don't use a sandforce controller in them anymore. (you may want to double check some of the links too, Someone said earlier that one of the z87 boards was linking to a z77..)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Granted it doesn't cover Brazil or china but it does probably 90% of amazon zones and most of your readership.<br />
<br />
In the very least tell people to shop around as if they don't know then they will probably expect you to tell them the best place to get parts.</div></div><hr />

As said above, multi monitor setups (aka having games through 3+ screens) is a niche, I tried it, it was fun experience but I removed the setup like 3 months in, cause it isn't offering really anything special to me personally past the &quot;wow&quot; factor when you first hook it up. Same goes for SLI/Crossfire setups with enthusiast performance cards. There is very few people who are willing to dish 2x or 3x $600 ($1200 or $1800) for graphics cards alone. <br />
<br />
I build two machines somewhere mid last year which will serve me well up until 2015, when I will most likely upgrade again, those are<br />
i5 3570k, 8GB DDR3, AMD R7950 and 120GB SSD - All games this far run super fine without any need for more power. <br />
<br />
I paid about 1200EUR per machine (including case, cooling and PSU), yes it's more expensive in Europe, but that's two machines for 2400EUR, where's if I would go balls to the walls with Titan or SLI it would be pretty much the price for one machine. <br />
<br />
Also on that 120GB SSDs, you can get additional mechanical drivers or even SSDs in the future, also external driver and NAS is something people buy in masses now, so a 120GB SSD for the OS and few games should be enough for everyone.</div></div><hr />

Most likely wouldn't change their minds, but it would go a long way towards at least giving players a heads-up as well as a chance to respond before the fact (instead of after it). I can understand why they didn't give advance warning for the big mining/herb node nerf of patch 5.1, but what's their excuse for not mentioning anything regarding the DMF change (or &quot;no loot for scenarios&quot;, for that matter).<br />
<br />
We have different views but, regardless of that, I believe Blizzard has done a lousy job this patch in communicating not-so-insignificant changes no matter which way you spin the wheel.</div></div><hr />
