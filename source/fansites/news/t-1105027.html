<br />
They're changing intellect, it'll no longer increase mana, every caster will have a base mana of 100k.<br />
<br />
<br />
And to the hunters yelling that they're getting nerfed, it's pretty obvious that the abilities that use weapon damage are getting nerfed when the weapon damage is pretty much being doubled.<br />

What appears to be nerfs to many is in fact a removal of all the bandaid fixes they've done over the course of the past few patches as they're actually finally fixing some of our biggest problems. <br />
<br />
- Changing the attack power bonus from hawk to a percentage vs a flat number in of itself is huge for us. We've needed this for ages. <br />
<br />
- The increase in range from kill command is going to be a wonderful blessing to BM hunters, no longer will they be cursed to wait on the pet to arrive on target to actually dps. <br />
<br />
- Removal of minimum range... nuff said <br />
<br />
- Changing Rapid Fire to a 3 min CD vs a 5 min,... ummm hello? <br />
<br />
- Bestial Wrath CD cut in half - Our pets aoe now when we do <br />
<br />
- hunter's mark is applied to our targets automatically by many of our shots and provides a flat damage increase for all party members vs attack power which doesn't help many classes as it is now.<br />
<br />
- Ummmm all 5 pets out at once for a new CD.... Need a say more? I mean really. <br />
<br />
<br />
And that's just a few of them. The weapon damage on ranged weapons is likely to be changed, it's very early in beta. But seriously if we get to keep at least the majority of the changes incoming for us, hunter's are far from in a bad place come MoP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When i'm in heroics on my Blood DK and i'm doing 22k+ DPS (subsequently Out-dpsing all the other DPS in the group), and taking no damage on bosses like Asira Dawnslayer, then even I will admit my class is fucked up and needed some damn good nerfing.<br />
<br />
I approve of these changes though, tanking was never about doing good DPS, it was never supposed to be about doing good DPS; it's about reducing damage taken and above all else, surviving. If that seems boring to people then frankly they need to roll another class, but frankly I look forward to thinking &quot;What's the best way to reduce the damage i'm taking during these fights&quot; as opposed to &quot;DEATH STRIIIIIIIKE!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
My god, do you know how drastically the game is changing?? You have no clue if anything is a nerf or buff at this point. Almost every ability for every spec has been altered in some way..<br />
<br />
Take my moonkin for instance.. OH MY GOD, THEY HAVE COMPLETELY REMOVED INSECT SWARM!! That was about 12% of my overall damage OMG OMG:: We are so nerfed!!! the world is ending111!!1111one<br />
<br />
You cannot possibly look at ¬¥now does 40% weapon damage instead of 50%¬¥ for one skill and say your spec is nerfed. In the past 30 mins, you were able to determine your total DPS change and compare it to the 29 other specs who all are changing drastically?</div></div><hr />

<br />
In MoP you will not gain any +mana or manareg from items/gear. just from talents. pretty much a rip off of swtor system.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc6653dda655</div><div class="date">2012-03-27, 02:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Needless to say Warlock changes are far and away the best (excelling the Monk talents, I would say), but this expansion also looks to be a great and more forgiving expansion for rogues:<br />
<br />
-Longer Slice and Dice (Which is nice for Combat/Subtlety)<br />
-Big-ass ambushes again<br />
-Deadly Poison fixed/less ramp-up time (fixes the warlock-syndrome of doing bad dps on trash due to having to wait on DoTs)<br />
-No feint CD - Great for avoiding AoE damage<br />
-No need to change targets for Bandit's Guile (Single target refreshing rocks for bosses)<br />
-A proper finisher for Assassination-Backstab/Haemorrhage much more on par (Backstab seeming like a damn good filler/Haemorrhage giving a 20% damage buff), and 8 energy/2 secs to boot making Subtlety much less of a nightmare)<br />
-An improved stealth and a group stealth<br />
<br />
All in all, the Rogue class works pretty well already and is being polished up nicely in time for MoP, and by the looks of it, they won't have to completely relearn how to play their class either as everything looks pretty equal to how it is now in a good way (As opposed to our warlock friends who'll have a lot of homework to do :p )</div></div><hr />

Umm.. no.. it is something they said they wanted to do about a year ago when they realized that mana became unimportant for healing after the first patch. They want mana management to be an important part of spell selection (mostly for healers). It only really was important in the first tier, after that your INT gave you such a large mana pool that you never really worried about it.</div></div><hr />

Resistance is being removed, however the racials reduce damage by 1%, not resist, it's just a flat 1% reduction, no resistance involved.<br />

I love what they have done with the bows :)<br />
<br />
The agility on that bow is severely weak even though it's supposed to be making up for us not getting 2 handed stats anymore. With my current staff an bow I have 1,364 agility just from the static stats. It goes to 1,554 when I factor in gem's,socket bonuses, and enchants from my staff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Feint: No longer has a cooldown. Performs an evasive maneuver, reducing damage taken from area-of-effect attacks by 50% for 5 sec. (Where is the threat reduction? That was the entire purpose to this ability originally... Forget AOE damage reduction - that's why we have CoS.) <br />
Fleet Footed: No longer increases healing effects on you. (Why are they doing this in the first place? Taking the healing from Quickening &amp; returning it to the original talent makes rogues less of a healing priority in dungeons/raids, so this is a flat-out nerf) <br />
Kick: Now has a 15 sec cooldown, up from 10 sec. (Again, why? Are they doing this so as to force raid groups to have to relegate more people to interrupt-cycles? I remember this was my only job on Vezax when my guild at the time was working on Ulduar10, and we barely had the DPS to cover it; having to rotate interruption duty between 2 players was too risky for us and we would've taken longer to down him that way.) <br />
Wound Poison: Renamed from Instant Poison, now reduces all healing effects on the target by 25% for 15 sec. (Why not just say they're removing Instant altogether and then removing the damage function of the current Wound Poison?) <br />
<br />
Assassination <br />
<br />
Cut to the Chase: Your Eviscerate refreshes your Slice and Dice duration to its 5 combo point maximum. (Hello, what happened to the inclusion of Envenom here...?) <br />
Vend: Duration reduced to 20 sec, down from 30. Now increases the damage you deal to the target by 30%, up from 20%. (I have to wait until I can test how this holds up; at first, a 50% increase in effect at the cost of 1/3 the uptime doesn't seem right but tests have to be done involving the revamping of weapon damage) <br />
<br />
As for Combat &amp; Subtlety, I haven't been Sub since Feb '07 and I've never nor will I ever go Combat. So I can't say anything regarding those changes. But the fact remains that of all the standing Rogue changes, these are the ones I'm most dissatisfied with, sans Vendetta temporarily: if any/all of these go through, I'm going to be finding my action bar a couple spaces empty, my dedicated poison-bag less crowded, having to rely on (half the time anyway) poor healers more than I'd like to, and having a talent that I'm never going to benefit from regarding my finishers. I'm just hoping I get my beta key soon so I can work to prevent at least a couple of these changes from being in the end product when it goes live...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Keep in mind that Resto Shamans receive a 400% increase to their mana pool. So basically, divide all those base mana costs by 5 and they end up being around the same as the adjusted costs for the other healing classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you kidding? locks are turning out to be 3 rather complicated mechanics, how is that derp friendly?<br />
<br />
I personally enjoy the complication, makes it more fun, but this is no way derp friendly. <br />
<br />
I mean seriously, you kill yourself as destro if you can't manage it properly. <br />
<br />
As demo, a bunch changes when you metmophize, so you have to know both halves of each spell. you have to safely manage your demonic fury, if you use the abilities that use it up, they do more damage, but your overall damage goes down. however if you dont' use them you are missing out on CDs. it isn't the basic &quot;offCD use it!&quot; that many specs are now. <br />
<br />
And for aff you have to juggle, okay I have one soulshard left, do i reenergize, or do I get a little more dps out, use the shard, and then regather the shards. you have to plan in advance if you are going to have enough time between haunts and whatever else uses them to get more shards, or do I need to do ti in advance so I'm ready? also if someone always has 3 shards and regathers asap, then they lose the nightfall proc. <br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but none of those sound even remotely close to derp friendly</div></div><hr />

Lol at people thinking Hunter's got nerfed. Do some research. And what's up with the resistance racials? I thought Resistance was being removed in MoP. Spell Resistance the stat is gone but it looks like the spell resistance racials are being changed into flat unreduceable 1% spell damage reduction.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malackai</div><div class="date">2012-03-27, 07:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you think those are all nerfs to hunter class, then you seriously need to read up on how the class works better. What appears to be nerfs to many is in fact a removal of all the bandaid fixes they've done over the course of the past few patches as they're actually finally fixing some of our biggest problems. <br />
<br />
- Changing the attack power bonus from hawk to a percentage vs a flat number in of itself is huge for us. We've needed this for ages. <br />
<br />
- The increase in range from kill command is going to be a wonderful blessing to BM hunters, no longer will they be cursed to wait on the pet to arrive on target to actually dps. <br />
<br />
- Removal of minimum range... nuff said <br />
<br />
- Changing Rapid Fire to a 3 min CD vs a 5 min,... ummm hello? <br />
<br />
- Bestial Wrath CD cut in half - Our pets aoe now when we do <br />
<br />
- hunter's mark is applied to our targets automatically by many of our shots and provides a flat damage increase for all party members vs attack power which doesn't help many classes as it is now.<br />
<br />
- Ummmm all 5 pets out at once for a new CD.... Need a say more? I mean really. <br />
<br />
<br />
And that's just a few of them. The weapon damage on ranged weapons is likely to be changed, it's very early in beta. But seriously if we get to keep at least the majority of the changes incoming for us, hunter's are far from in a bad place come MoP.<br />
<br />
only thing I am not happy about is that black arrow is now a cast (how low the casting time might be) and is STILL linked to Explosion trap &gt;_&gt;<br />
one thing i have not be able to test yet is are some of our spells still affected by Silence?</div></div><hr />

Its not ilvl inflation since weapons that exist now are being doubled. It seems to me they could just eave it the way it is and not have to adjust a bunch of weapon damage abilities. Also I get the fixed mana pool but how is regen supposed to work? Will having more mana give you more regen(shams and pallies)? Otherwise it seems arbitrary to have more mana but your spells cost relatively the same amount of mana. And they still need to adjust the focus cost of CS, AS, and ES for hunters. Everyone had efficiency and now it should be built in like other mandatory talents and glyphs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah they said they wanted to and completely messed it up.. They also said they would introduce path of the titans. They said they would make a dance studio. They said they wanted there to be more choices in talent trees and then forced 31 points in main talent tree to be mandatory. Blizzard are full of it. It¬¥s not just other people using Blizzard ideas, Blizzard are not above stealing any idea they might find usefull. Pet battles (pokemon), the new mana design (swtor), aoe loot (swtor + ???)..

<br />
I assume the Tracking system just basically works the same way as other tracking works - i.e. you tick what you want to see, untick the stuff you don't want to see. At least that would make sense.<br />
<br />
But changing the warlock pets to use Energy just like the hunter pets is a nice change, and it makes more sense. The Felhunter's Spell Lock without cooldown can be really nice in fights where you can replenish the energy fast enough or if the fight doesn't last for too long.</div></div><hr />

Because kicks went out of control in PVP, so every kick which has 10 sec CD gets 15 sec CD in MOP. (Shaman gets 12 but it's only a 2 sec lockout instead of 4 or 5 for Warr/Rogue). Same reasons for the dispels having 8 sec CD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, keep trying to kick the huge amount of instant cast spells...<br />
<br />
If something is out of control in pvp is the stupid amount of &quot;too good to be instant&quot; instant cast spells... Even Blizzard acknowledged that in Cata beta and said that they would lower the huge amount of haste spellcasters had + the amount of dmg/healing from instant casts + increase cast time on spells that had cast (remember the &quot;impossible for a human to try to interrupt a 1 sec cast polymorph&quot;?)...<br />
<br />
But in the end, they just went the other way and let it go crazy with stupid amount of instant casts doing too much dmg/healing and enough haste in pvp (while also lowering the cast time for some spells).<br />
<br />
Now they'll just increase the CD for interrupts and nothing else? Good call...<br />
<br />
Hope that all these changes don't stop there or doesn't look like that... it's stupid when you compare druids, mages, etc... to DKs for example... a couple of fixes like implementing current &quot;must have&quot; glyphs and a few situational talents like the one that increased the range for Howling blast, Icy touch, Chains of Ice, etc... as base effect for those spells and dmg balance to increase/decrease the use of certain skills (plus frost presence fix including a frost talent effect on it) and control tank excess of dmg... nothing in there compare to changes like druid ones...<br />
<br />
And on top of all that... back to atk power bonus from STR classes to STR classes? lol...<br />

Since you no longer gain mana from intel, you need a talent so that a caster spec/class gets more than their base mana (which is 20k-ish at lvl 85).<br />
<br />

Well for example, they're removing the instant FoL on Infusion of Light proc in MOP (at least from what I understand from the data).<br />
<br />
But anyway, people have been complaining about the amount of kicks in the game for quite some time in Cata as well (just see the AJ forums).<br />
Now that kicks and dispels both have a CD (and healer/caster mana no longer scales with intel), their use will have to be a little bit more careful.. hopefully.</div></div><hr />

They're actually good, saves a ton of gold for leveling them (and you get the max lvl faster since it's 15 less points) at the begining of the xpac (when prices are all crazy).<br />
<br />
The only ones that actually get problem with those are the ones going for realm's 1st or the achievement (since the extra points doesn't count for it).<br />

You realise that it's alread useless today? You need to do the killing blow. Unless it's granted that you're the one doing the killing blows, you won't be using that a lot the same way you don't use it today (they basically just changed from the stupid and longer cast Holy Light to Flash of Light).</div></div><hr />

Yes hunters lose a stat stick, but so does everyone else, relics are going away and ranged weapons are becoming hunter only items. My point stands; the numbers here are only a balance to the change in weapon damage, and when you take that into consideration they aren't really a nerf. Now whether hunter's numbers are balanced with respect to the other classes'? That, would take a hell of a lot more testing.</div></div><hr />

It is also because according to the B.Net calculator, HL is Holy-only, so they have to move it to Flash of Light instead. :)</div></div><hr />

Hunter &quot;stat sticks&quot; had far more stats than relics and offhands. The disparity is huge. So removing our &quot;stat sticks&quot; without increasing the stats on our bows leaves hunters with an overall stat deficiency when compared to other classes. Even if they identify this and balance it for new MoP weapons it will still leave leveling hunters at a significant stat deficiency compared to their groups because they are not going to go back and balance equipment from previous content.</div></div><hr />

This is exactly correct.<br />
<br />
The lockout period for wind shear is 3 seconds and the cooldown is 12 seconds.<br />
The lockout period for everything else is 4 seconds and the cooldown is 15 seconds.<br />

I don't see the problem in here.<br />
<br />
Hunter lose a main hand weapon &amp; gain a huge boost in ranged weapon stats.<br />
Everyone else loses ranged weapons/relics/totems &amp; gains no boost to their weapons.<br />
<br />
This makes it roughly equal and even in some ways a buff for hunters.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adrim</div><div class="date">2012-03-27, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a Blood DK I currently tank all Twilight Heroics in pure DPS gear. No avoidance stats, DPS trinkets, Rune of Fallen Crusader...basically everything I do for Frost spec except with a 2H weap (Gurth, naturally). I do about 40K consistently. Gimmick fights like in Wells I push upwards of 70K. If I have a couple of even semi-decent 20K DPS in the group we can fly through that shit. And not a peep from healers about my survivability. With all the haste, my rune regen is getting to the point where I can Death Strike non-stop and even with leftover amounts of Mastery I'm still proc'ing more Blood Shield than mobs can burn through. AntiMagic Shell for anything Blood Shield can't do.<br />
<br />
It's glorious but you know what? It's fucking just desserts for being shit on as tanks the entire Xpac.<br />
<br />
Remember DK tanks at the start of Cata? Getting globalled because we had to eat massive hits to proc tissue thin shields? Dying because our healing strike could miss or be dodged? (Sorta like if a Warrior had a random chance to drop his shield on the floor instead of blocking). Remember healers basically hating DKs and all the overhealing wasted back when mana was scarce because they would top us off before our Death Strike heal could kick in?<br />
<br />
I have played Blood DK since release and I have been through the highs and lows. I remember the godlike days early wrath with Heart Strike hitting two for 100% and Dancing Rune hitting two more for 100%. I remember when Death Strike did healing based on damage DONE instead of TAKEN which mean by the end of Wrath I was also tanking every heroic in DPS gear and blowing through everything but Nexus in under 15 minutes. I cheered when Blood Tanking became the One True Tank spec. And I cried when I saw how broken things were in Cataclysm. If I was going to be one of the many thousands who quit WoW because of Cataclysm, the breaking of Blood Tank would have done it.<br />
<br />
But I held out...I geared for 8% hit and 26 expertise while every other tank dumped all those extra stats into mitigation. I worked stupid blood runes into my rotation to keep the extra 6% Blade Barrier mitigation we were balanced around. I suffered through my constant deaths as tank because of rune wack-a-mole and low armor because our armor was originally balanced around Stoneskin Gargoyle but Blood DKs had to switch for mitigation to Swordshattering.<br />
<br />
So I consider these glorious final months of Cataclysm ample and just reward for the miserable times we Blood DKs have experienced. Anyone in this thread bitching or whining about Blood Nerfs is not a true Blood Tank. They are a last minute Flavor of the Month twerp who will gladly move on to the next flavor anyway. I piss on your false tears.<br />
<br />
True Blood DKs know this is only part of the cycle and we just bid our time and wait for the end of the next Xpac when we can once again stroll through heroics naked and belittle asshole DPS with mocking Recounts &quot;Geez man, you can't even do as much DPS as a tank&quot;. We can wait.</div></div><hr />

Technically you still want to swap between Combat Stance (Single target DPS) &amp; Berserk Stance (AoE DPS).<br />
<br />
Other than that you don't really have to be in a specific stance to do anything anymore. All the abilities are usable in any stance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mana costs are being adjusted to accommodate the change where Intellect no longer gives mana. <br />
<br />
Instead, all the healers &amp; DPS casters gain 400% more mana as a passive talent.<br />
<br />
To make it simple:<br />
<br />
<br />
Your base mana at level 90 is 100k.<br />
You get 400% extra mana as a DPS caster/healer.<br />
Your total mana at level 90 is 500k.<br />
Every class will have exactly same mana pools in the same specialization.</div></div><hr />

That seems a bit odd to me too and most likely will change in future, unless they intend for us to be able to stack those buffs which is unlikely.<br />

<br />
True enough actually. My mistake.<br />
<br />
Guess they've changed their plans since now I'm also checking a lot of dps specs having their mana cost hammered to accommodate the lower mana pools that we have even now. <br />
<br />
So I guess what's really happening is that they are giving some classes/specs the 400% bump, but leaving others with base mana &amp; hammered mana costs. More I think of this I feel like this is temporary and they are still going with the 400% to all ideology. Right now it's just not implemented to all classes/specs just yet so they have to lower the mana costs to even make these classes playable in the Beta.<br />
<br />
It also feels a bit weird that right now Holy priest would have less mana at level 90 than they do as level 85 on live. (Assuming Base mana being something like 100k at level 90.) This crunch doesn't really feel that awesome, even though I'm still losing mana with the approximately same rate.</div></div><hr />

That would be relatively silly since you would most likely just use the one anyways.<br />
Even if they would allow you to use them on shared cd you would only end up using one, possibly in rare cases two.<br />
<br />
Mastery, Crit &amp; Haste are so well specialization bound for Warlocks that you would not even consider the others in most cases.<br />

<br />
Yes. We were lacking necessary mitigation for the entire Xpac, so now that they finally admitted their mistake in design and made it so the heal can never miss, we end up overpowered. What Blood DKs are experiencing now is how Blood Tanking could have worked from the beginning if they had just had just listen to the million of posts on the forum. In truth, the developers are being incompetent twice (first by breaking it, then by overcompensating with the fix) but I prefer to see it more charitably as their way of apologizing.<br />
<br />
And no, I am not exaggerating. At the start of Cata, it was essentially Warrior/Paladin/Druid mitigation: Take 70% of the incoming damage. DK mitigation: Take 100% of incoming damage, then one GCD later heal 15% back and get 15% shielding. Two big hits in a row might take a Warrior/Paladin/Druid dangerously low, but the odds were excellent that they would block/avoid either one or both. Two big hits in a row would kill a DK because they couldn't proc their mitigation until after getting hit the first time, and their damage balance was based around self-heal that could miss. The &quot;proper&quot; thing for DK tanks to do was to wait for a big hit before using their Death Strike to maximize the heal/shield. But that meant passing up a lot of steady minimum heal regen or blowing our one expensive 5m rune-reset cooldown. Plus, as I mentioned, it was far more likely for a healer to top a DK tank off with a mana wasting greater heal than to wait for them to Death Strike their health back up and then use a normal heal.<br />
<br />
In Mists when every tank has to play the active mitigation game and not just gem/reforge to cap and enjoy permanent passive mitigation, it should make for a much more interesting comparison.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shakkenbake</div><div class="date">2012-03-27, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice moonkin changes! the benefits we already have are in a 3min cd (10% nature and arcane, because that was WAY overpowered, ofc), no longer base damage increase to spell damage, shooting stars only proccing from critical strikes...We lose any advantages we had, and only get an agility conversion. Blizzard could just delete the spec so all we can choose from is kitty, bear or tree, and stop nerfbatting us all the damn time. Good to know that sub rogues (so underperforming) and locks are receiving WONDROUS amounts of lovebuffin` YAAAARGHHHHHH<br />
<br />
Guess you have a hard time reading buddy, but the moonkin changes are awesome. They really took the weak points of current spec and addressed those. First the aoe in lunar seems like it got a huge buff. Hurricane turning into a lunar version of its self, as well as starfall's cooldown being reset once you hit lunar eclipse seems like a very elegant solution to the current eclipse aoe inequalities. <br />
<br />
Secondly, I'm not sure exactly how it's intended to work, but it seems like if you were to cast just one sunfire/moonfire, you can roll that single cast through the entire fight seeing that your nukes refresh its duration. Coupled with the fact that you no longer need to cast a DoT to proc natures grace but instead just hit a new eclipse seems to support this idea as well. This does take away some of the complexity of the rotation, as knowing when to cast dots was something of a defining factor in your dps.<br />
<br />
Also the simple fact that we have an actual cooldown (other than the pathetic spell which was force of nature) is exciting to me. It was literally the worst part of playing a boomkin, there was no big CD you could utilize to max dps during important parts of the fight besides controlling your eclipse state. The reverts on lunar shower are also a definent quality of life improvement, as the change in t12 was a huge miss on blizzards part (no one wanted that talent after the change).<br />
<br />
One of the things that I'm interested to see on how it will pan out is starsurge granting 20 energy. This does a few things to how boomkins currently work. One, it wont allow for an extra eclipsed spell in lunar due to it now granting the same energy as starfire, and secondly for every two casts (euphoria procs should be counted as two casts) during solar it decreases the amount of time it takes to get lunar by one. Its sort of a role reversal. Instead of getting one more eclipsed spell in lunar, we have a chance to have one less uneclipsed cast in solar. Depending on the values of spells this could be a buff or a nerf, but it does seem as if we will (on average) get to eclipses faster than the current energy gain models (assuming the same haste and cast time values).<br />
<br />
Overall, I see nothing but buffs for balance and any seeming 'nerfs' are counterbalanced by a buff. Please for the love of god, if you don't intimately know a spec, don't cry OMG GG BLIZZARD NERFING BOOMKINS AGAAAIIINNN!!!! You need to look at the spec as a big picture type deal and not how many new spells you get for the expansion</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since all priest specs use mana, they will all have high base mana. Say it is 100k. Meanwhile, the other healing classes have specs that either don't use mana as a resource or are not heavily reliant on it. Say a shaman has 20k base mana so that Enhancement spec doesn't have a ridiculous mana pool. However, Restoration passively has a 400% increase to their mana pool, making their max mana equal to 100k. Same as the priest's.<br />
<br />
Now, let's look at base mana costs of spells. Priest's Greater Heal is 6% of 100k base mana, or 6k mana cost. Shaman's Greater Healing Wave is 36% of 20k base mana, or 7200 mana cost. As you can see, these costs are very similar given that the spells aren't exactly identical and neither are the mana regen mechanics between the two classes.<br />
<br />
Conclusion: these base mana cost adjustments make sense.</div></div><hr />

No avoidance stats, DPS trinkets, Rune of Fallen Crusader...basically everything I do for Frost spec except with a 2H weap (Gurth, naturally). I do about 40K consistently. Gimmick fights like in Wells I push upwards of 70K. If I have a couple of even semi-decent 20K DPS in the group we can fly through that shit. And not a peep from healers about my survivability. With all the haste, my rune regen is getting to the point where I can Death Strike non-stop and even with leftover amounts of Mastery I'm still proc'ing more Blood Shield than mobs can burn through. AntiMagic Shell for anything Blood Shield can't do.<br />
<br />
It's glorious but you know what? It's fucking just desserts for being shit on as tanks the entire Xpac.<br />
<br />
Remember DK tanks at the start of Cata? Getting globalled because we had to eat massive hits to proc tissue thin shields? Dying because our healing strike could miss or be dodged? (Sorta like if a Warrior had a random chance to drop his shield on the floor instead of blocking). Remember healers basically hating DKs and all the overhealing wasted back when mana was scarce because they would top us off before our Death Strike heal could kick in?<br />
<br />
I have played Blood DK since release and I have been through the highs and lows. I remember the godlike days early wrath with Heart Strike hitting two for 100% and Dancing Rune hitting two more for 100%. I remember when Death Strike did healing based on damage DONE instead of TAKEN which mean by the end of Wrath I was also tanking every heroic in DPS gear and blowing through everything but Nexus in under 15 minutes. I cheered when Blood Tanking became the One True Tank spec. And I cried when I saw how broken things were in Cataclysm. If I was going to be one of the many thousands who quit WoW because of Cataclysm, the breaking of Blood Tank would have done it.<br />
<br />
But I held out...I geared for 8% hit and 26 expertise while every other tank dumped all those extra stats into mitigation. I worked stupid blood runes into my rotation to keep the extra 6% Blade Barrier mitigation we were balanced around. I suffered through my constant deaths as tank because of rune wack-a-mole and low armor because our armor was originally balanced around Stoneskin Gargoyle but Blood DKs had to switch for mitigation to Swordshattering.<br />
<br />
So I consider these glorious final months of Cataclysm ample and just reward for the miserable times we Blood DKs have experienced. Anyone in this thread bitching or whining about Blood Nerfs is not a true Blood Tank. They are a last minute Flavor of the Month twerp who will gladly move on to the next flavor anyway. I piss on your false tears.<br />
<br />
True Blood DKs know this is only part of the cycle and we just bid our time and wait for the end of the next Xpac when we can once again stroll through heroics naked and belittle asshole DPS with mocking Recounts &quot;Geez man, you can't even do as much DPS as a tank&quot;. We can wait.<br />
<br />
This, sir/ma'am made my day.<br />
<br />
Thank you. And yes, we can wait. Though admittedly I have considered re-rolling Brewmaster as my new main (to hopefully and finally get my hands on a Legendary[dumb reason I know, unless they make a tank Legendary that DK's can use]) the power of a Blood DK is just too much to pass up - we can solo tank fights most other classes have to struggle with AND dish out excellent damage to boot.<br />
<br />
And because of that, it really makes it hard to really want to park my Death Knight, so I'll let time decide and make my final decision come pre-MoP event.<br />
<br />
To those worried about nerf's or are panicking at the current changes - don't. Take it with a grain of salt for the time being. And if those changes do come to pass, take it like the true DK you are and push yourself to overcome and continue to outperform other tanks while being nerfed again. We can take it.<br />
<br />
We await a true challenge Blizz. Bring it.<br />
<br />
* * * <br />
<br />
On another note - finalized Raid comp in MoP will, overall, effect my new main decision as well; if we will benefit from having one specific class over another as a whole, then I will park my DK.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The lockout period for wind shear is 3 seconds and the cooldown is 12 seconds.<br />
The lockout period for everything else is 4 seconds and the cooldown is 15 seconds.<br />

I don't see the problem in here.<br />
<br />
Hunter lose a main hand weapon &amp; gain a huge boost in ranged weapon stats.<br />
Everyone else loses ranged weapons/relics/totems &amp; gains no boost to their weapons.<br />
<br />
This makes it roughly equal and even in some ways a buff for hunters.<br />
<br />
No there is a massive difference and we as hunters are losing out big and I'll show you why.<br />
<br />

Look at how hard we are getting fucked on our primary and secondary stats. Also yes I know the staff is a bit higher ilevel but the bow is the best one listed so far and even if a bow jumped those few levels we still wouldn't see anywhere near that high of stats on them.<br />

<br />
You know, through pages and pages of griping and moaning, no one has brought up that weapon damage for ALL OF THE MELEE CLASSES, as well as hunters ranged weapons, is going through the roof, hence the damage % changes to strikes and attacks for Death Knights, Enhancement, Rogues, Warriors and Paladins. Look at Wowhead, and compare current weapon damage to their 5.0 upgraded weapon damage and dps. ALL of them are doubled.<br />
<br />
Examples:<br />
Golad, Twilight of the Aspects - Top damage in Cata = 1840 ; Top damage in MoP = 3680; Cata DPS = 786.3; MoP DPS = 1572.6<br />
Total DPS and Damage range is DOUBLED<br />
<br />
Gurthalak, Voice of the Deeps - Top damage in Cata = 4580 ; Top damage in MoP = 9160; Cata DPS = 1060.2; MoP DPS = 2120.3<br />
Total DPS and Damage range is DOUBLED<br />
<br />
So all this complaining about &quot;nerfs&quot; is really stupid at this point because there is so much of the damage being shifted into the weapon damage itself.<br />
Just as an example for all the Blood DK complainers:<br />
Gurthalak, Voice of the Deeps performing a Death Strike during Cataclysm with no modifiers does 150% x 4580 +330 = 7200<br />
Gurthalak, Voice of the Deeps performing a Death Strike during MoP with no modifiers does 75% x 9160 +112 = 6982<br />
<br />
OMG, You lose 218 damage before modifiers between the old model and new damage model.<br />
<br />
Gurthalak, Voice of the Deeps performing a Heart Strike during Cataclysm with no modifiers does 175% x 4580 +819 = 8834<br />
Gurthalak, Voice of the Deeps performing a Heart Strike during MoP with no modifiers does 90% x 9160 +250 = 8494<br />
<br />
OMG, You lose 340 damage before modifiers between the old model and new damage model.<br />
<br />
Stop acting like it's the end of the world because the strikes lost VERY little of their potency.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So yeah we are losing around 700 agility and around 800 ratings worth of other stats, but in trade we are getting around 1000 dps to our ranged weapon flat out.<br />
<br />
You also might notice that it's mostly MM Hunters that got their skill coefficiency tweaked with around 80% drop in damage (AS, Aimed, SS etc.). That still leaves us 100% (more damage from the Ranged weapon change) - 80% (drop in dmg from the percentage balancing) that equals 20% buff in damage. Now weight that flat out 20% damage versus 700 agility &amp; 800 rating and you'll get the picture why I'm not worried.<br />
<br />
The other thing to remember is that Cobra Shot for BM/Survival and, for example, Chimera Shot still stayed the same as far as damage goes, not to even mention the white damage that we will do now that it's been outright DOUBLED.<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
<br />
<br />
Double white damage<br />
Double skill damage<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Cons<br />
<br />
<br />
Losing around 700 Agility<br />
Losing around 800 Ratings<br />
Skill coefficiency being tweaked.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean, I'm not saying we won't be losing anything. I'm saying we are still about the same damage wise. There are no big nerfs or buffs as far as pure numbers go.</div></div><hr />

I guess what I'm trying to get at is why do we have to lose so many stats just to gain weapon damage when the melee classes don't have to sacrifice their weapon stats to gain equal weapon dps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you lift your eyes just a bit over your own post you will see that Hunters are:<br />
<br />
<br />
Gaining around 100% increase to their weapon dps.<br />
Losing around 700 Agility &amp; 800 ratings of other stuff. (Your Staff/Polearm is gone)<br />
Seeing some changes in skill percentages. (Due to increased weapon damage)<br />
<br />
<br />
All in all, you still have the same damage than before the changes.<br />

<br />
In a way you are right about that and I think we might be seeing a change here before the release.<br />
<br />
More or less, I think they are just going to end up giving Ranged Weapons the same amount of Agility/Stamina/etc. than what the other weapons have.<br />
<br />
So in essence we would have out stat-stick baked into our ranged weapon.</div></div><hr />

Please stop interpreting stuff besides its initial scope. Blizz current thinking is that a longer lockout warrants a longer cooldown. I'm not saying I agree or disagree with this logic. &gt;_&lt;</div></div><hr />

Shaman mostly got nerfs, in my opinion, not buffs.<br />

Umm.. no.. it is something they said they wanted to do about a year ago when they realized that mana became unimportant for healing after the first patch. They want mana management to be an important part of spell selection (mostly for healers). It only really was important in the first tier, after that your INT gave you such a large mana pool that you never really worried about it.<br />
Funny thing is, resto shaman get mana regen only from spirit, while druid and paladin (not certain about priest) get to &quot;double-dip&quot; by getting regen from intellect as well. So to say that mana never mattered after the first tier is slightly incorrect.</div></div><hr />

Arcane got mighty buff. <br />

You are forgetting the loss of Imp Blink, freezing Cone of Cold, Shattered Barrier, and Blast Wave, plus the nerfing of certain aspects of Counterspell, Cone of Cold slow, Dragon Breathe, Cold Snap, Slow and Blazing Speed. There are more nerfs, and I'm sure plenty buffs. Let's also not forget to place these changes into context. Some of the buffs you mention just return the spells to the way they currently are or so they mesh with how the talent and mana systems work. You actually listed a buff to Ritual of Refreshment? Are Rogues shaking in their boots at the thought of table spam. &quot;Step back! This donut is filled with custard, and I'm not afraid to use it!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not saying Mages wouldn't be losing anything. I'm saying that we shouldn't be worried of these &quot;balancing&quot; acts at this very moment. A lot of these changes also include the overall balancing of snares, interrupts and other such things. As to your list:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Improved Blink - Still might comes as a Glyph.<br />
Cone of Cold Freeze - One of the only big nerfs I could find, I'll give you that.<br />
Shattered Barrier - Since it's a talent, there was no reason to bake it in the talent itself and it might very well come back as a Glyph.<br />
Blast Wave - Well that's gone, so get over it. We all knew it was going to be benched anyways.<br />
Counterspell - Tweaked to match other such effects. (All interrupts (except Wind Shear) are now normalized to 4 second lockdown with 15 second cooldown)<br />
Cone of Cold Slow - Again tweaked to match other such effects in duration.<br />
Dragon's Breath - Tweaked to match other such effects.<br />
Cold Snap - It's still a talent, so no difference there.<br />
Slow - Tweaked to match other slow effects (All snares are pretty much normalized to 50% right now).<br />
Blazing Speed - Still there as a talent, so it's still your choice whether you take it or not.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You might also realize that this was the first Beta patch and the point of this patch (as we can all clearly see) was to normalize all CC effects to be roughly the same in duration, as well as tweaking the mana costs to accommodate the new mana system.<br />
<br />
The next patch is where they actually start to look at whose damage seems low, who needs more CC and &quot;who's got the power&quot;. Sure, these were in essence nerfs for mage class, but there is absolutely no reason to worry about the numbers at this very point.</div></div><hr />

You might also realize that this was the first Beta patch and the point of this patch (as we can all clearly see) was to normalize all CC effects to be roughly the same in duration, as well as tweaking the mana costs to accommodate the new mana system.<br />
<br />
The next patch is where they actually start to look at whose damage seems low, who needs more CC and &quot;who's got the power&quot;. Sure, these were in essence nerfs for mage class, but there is absolutely no reason to worry about the numbers at this very point.<br />
<br />
I think my post should have been directed to the post you responded to... I pretty much agree with you in spirit. Most of these nerfs and buffs are a result of several systems (dispel, mana, etc) changing dramatically and the new talent system causing restructuring of all the classes. <br />
<br />
Anyway, I will bite... just a little.<br />
<br />
Shattered Barrier - Remains to be seen. Better to be balanced without it. IMO I will miss it about as much as relying on frostbite. <br />
Blast Wave - Still a nerf worth noting. Does not mean I'm not over it. I do miss the old Blastwave... with the old graphic :(<br />
Counterspell - Actually it was nerfed down to 6 seconds. Normalization or not, that's beside the point when people are screaming the mana cost adjustments of buffs. Both declarations are silly when you don't look at it in context.<br />
Cone of Cold Slow - See counterspell. Remember I'm pointing out that both buffs and nerfs are not being looked at by some posters in the overall context of the game. I'd also like to point out Disentanglement's return to all druid spec through talents. Not commenting on whether it's needed or not, just that it is a indirect nerf to kiting. Don't get angry kitty cats. I'm siding with you on the Monk dispel too.<br />
Dragon's Breath - See counterspell and CoC. <br />
Cold Snap - It resets less CDs, which is fine to keep it from being the default and Frost spec choice.<br />
Slow - They also changed the range slow as well.<br />
Blazing Speed - They changed it to an activated spell and only usable after taking a percentage of damage.</div></div><hr />

Priest at caster lvl. This is probably why the spell costs differs so dramatically, since the spell costs are calculated from base mana, and you get the 400% mana increase as Paladins aswell?</div></div><hr />
