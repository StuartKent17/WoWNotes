Northrend's New Kalu'ak Fishing Derby!<br />
Coming in patch 3.3.0, the esteemed tuskarr of the Kalu'ak are proud to introduce to Northrend the Kalu'ak Fishing Derby, a test of fishing skill with a healthy dash of luck! Every Wednesday beginning at 8 PM players can try to catch the elusive Blacktip Shark. Elder Clearwater sits in Dalaran for one hour awaiting the return of the quickest, most experienced fisher to bring him the first catch of the night. This champion fisher will be rewarded in-kind for his or her fishing expertise. Those who aren’t able to return with the first catch will still receive just reward for getting the Blacktip Shark to Elder Clearwater before he takes his leave.<br />
<br />
It is said that these sharks’ favorite meal are the bite-sized Pygmy Suckerfish. Perhaps a hook in their waters will do the trick. Because of the increased concentration of fish, you have an increased chance to catch a shark from fishing pools. Don't forget, in patch 3.3.0 you never catch trash from fishing pools, regardless of skill.<br />
<br />
The derby winner will receive a substantial chunk of experience (or money at maximum level) and gain 5000 reputation with the Kalu'ak. In addition, the champion will be given a choice between two unique rewards:<br />
<br />
[b] Dread Pirate Ring<br />
Binds on Account<br />
Unique-Equipped<br />
Finger<br />
+34 Stamina<br />
Requires level 1 to 80 (80)<br />
Equip: Improves critical strike rating by 53.<br />
Equip: Improves hit rating by 29.<br />
Equip: Experience gained from killing monsters and completing quests increased by 5%.<br />
<br />
Boots of the Bay<br />
Binds When Picked Up<br />
Feet<br />
Requires Fishing (200)<br />
Equip: Increased Fishing +15.<br />
Use: Whisks you away to the finest drinking establishment in Booty Bay. (1 Day Cooldown)<br />
<br />
To keep it interesting, the Achievement &quot;Master Angler of Stranglethorn&quot; has been changed to &quot;Master Angler of Azeroth.&quot; This can be earned by winning either the Kalu'ak Fishing Derby or the Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza.<br />
<br />
Please bear in mind this feature will be undergoing testing on our Public Test Realms and is subject to change prior to the release of patch 3.3.0.</div></div><hr />

It is caster it is everything that is universal. <br />
Stamina: Everyone needs it<br />
Crit: Everyone needs it<br />
Hit: everyone needs i<br />

I guess it might not work perfect for healers</div></div><hr />

I assume there will be an spell power ring too, if so and if they stack a maximum of 30% if your in for it :o<br />
Edit: People reply to fast, seems to be an &quot;universial&quot; ring or whatever whoever called it. An ring for everyone, with hit &amp; crit :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't &quot;need&quot; heirloom items any more than you &quot;need&quot; to level fishing. And if it's anything like the Booty Bay fishing tournament, you won't &quot;need&quot; max-level fishing to compete.</div></div><hr />

<br />
umm did you read it? the best chance to get one is through a fishing pool and in 3.3 you will never get trash from fishing pools regardless of skill level.</div></div><hr />

Most guilds I've been in raid Tuesday, Thursday and some combination of weekend days. My current somewhat casual guild does Tues, Thurs, Sun. An older guild (Van/BC) I was in did Tues, Thurs, Sat, Sun. <br />
<br />
I do often run 10 mans on Wed/Sat, but that can always be pushed around for fishing tournament. <br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: This is US, and this might change if Europe servers were drastically off, but my understanding was that their raid resets are on Tuesday morning as well.</div></div><hr />

EU servers reset Wednesday morning. My old guild used to skip Wednesdays too, mostly cos of past experiences with patch day server fuck ups. I remember MC complete trash resets after emergency server restarts. *cries*</div></div><hr />

nope, our resets are on wednesday morning.<br />

still no problem though imo, on wednesday evening most people only quickly do the &quot;PuG&quot; raids a la ony and vault.<br />
at least on my server ;D</div></div><hr />

reset on europe is on wednesday morning, thats the point, so everyone goes farm raids then (at least most guilds i have been in did)<br />
<br />
im passionate fisher and i hate the time, i already have the Salty title (and i love it), but i rly want that ring :X but cant see our RL letting me go to fish rather than raid :'(<br />

Everyone's a critic...<br />

I know that I just may have enough time to catch the shark before we pull anyways... for once, sitting on my ass waiting for raids to start that supposedly &quot;start&quot; at 8 won't be so bad. =D</div></div><hr />

Also, whoever think these rewards suck is out of their mind. Your choice is a BoA ring that levels with you (more vendor fodder = gold) and also increases XP, as well as a pair of boots that increase your fishing and allow you a free port to not only where you'd go after finishing the STV fishing tourney without having to change your hearth, but also a neutral AH.<br />

Wow, what a great change! This will make the Sea Turtle hunt a lot easier, as well as being able to do so with just level 1 fishing!</div></div><hr />

<br />
A free portal to Booty Bay is... mildly cool... but in the form of a pair of boots? Gimmie a break. We had that with the red shoes from Karazhan Opera event. <br />
<br />
I mean... a little sharky pet! How hard would it be!<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to whine or anything, just saying that yeah... a bit disappointed. Hopefully there will be more 'side rewards' or something, because as it stands I don't see myself taking a raid night off (which, at the time it's scheduled for, I'd have to) to attend this event.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is what WotLK's free gear mentality does. People cried all week about how Horseman's loot was &quot;crap&quot;. Guess what these items are novelty rewards that players get for fun. If you PvP your rewards for high ratings and honor is PvP gear designed to help you do what you like. PvE encounters (except VoA) give out PvE gear so that you can advance to the next tier of content and farming becomes easier (not a problem with normal modes but different topic).<br />
<br />
With this event it's a fishing contest the rewards should help you... wait for it.... FISH! If you don't like fishing (like 90% of players) don't participate. If the fishing tourney handed out ilvl 251 or 277 gear then raiders / pvpers would be compelled to fish even if they didn't want to. The fact that they tied the only ring heirloom to the fishing event is stupid IMO. A LOT of people lvl alts very few ppl fish. What it should do is give a tome of fishing a BoA item that instantly teaches an alt max lvl fishing (only usable once) or a BoA lucky bauble that increases the catch chance of rare fish by 50 or 100%.<br />
<br />
Fishing rewards should be tied to the fishing tournament and PvE / PvP / Leveling rewards tied to it's own content.</div></div><hr />

Seriously? Not everyone in the game raids. I do have two solutions for people who raid and want to compete in this contest:<br />
<br />
1. See if you can get your guild or raid leader to reschedule the raid to start a half-hour later. This fishing contest could not take any longer than that.<br />
<br />
2. Wait to do it on a Wednesday night that you aren't raiding. Also, if it were for the title, you can do the Sunday fishing event. The other rewards aren't worthy of really skipping a raid.</div></div><hr />

The main problems with the fishing tournament were:<br />
<br />
- horrible timing<br />
- limited to 52 winners / realm / year<br />
- high demand due to meta achievements.<br />
<br />
So they release a new tournament with:<br />
<br />
- horrible timing (best raid time)<br />
- limited to 52 winners / realm / year<br />
- even higher demand due to awesome ring which is unique-equipped, but not account-unique, so tournament winners will compete again and again</div></div><hr />

Thank you for assuming you know anything about me.<br />

I'm not looking for 'free gear', I'm just looking for more *fun* gear. A pair of shoes isn't fun. It's mildly cool, but it's nothing like the awesome fish trinket from the original STV contest. I hate to say it, but check my armory for achievements and such if you think I'm just here whining about loot. I've tried to experience everything in the game, and have a great love and respect for fishing. <br />
<br />
My comment was just that I thought that, after waiting this long for a new Fishing contest, the rewards would be a bit more fun.</div></div><hr />

1: About the time.. It might be a convenience factor for those that cant make the stranglethorn fishing event.

Make it 8pm every day IMO, like it's going to be a big problem if everyone on the server has a BOA ring or 2, hell everyone gets the free tier gear.<br />

P.S. I guess i should stop comlaining about it, if ICC is like the other raids it will be a 2hr clear a month or 2 after release and wednesday should be off the raiding schedule.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some people raid on Wednesday night, some people sleep late on weekends. Can't make everyone happy. This contest is scheduled during a time (maybe not same day but 8pm is raiding for most guilds). If I personally choose to sleep late, I miss out on this individual contest. If I choose to skip a raid on Wednesday night (along with others), everyone is affected by how easy it is to form a consistent raid.</div></div><hr />

It's a trick question depending on where you stand. Raiders will obviously be saying that &quot;the casubads&quot; have been catered to more. The casuals will complain that not enough has been done for them.<br />
<br />
I stand in the middle. In my opinion, they both have been catered to equally. The raiders have been given 8 raids in this expansion. They also get awesome mounts, good gear, an upper hand in pvp, and awesome battles. <br />
<br />
The casuals have received heroic badges (which was something implemented in TBC), the LFG system (which could be considered a tool for raiders too), rep grind mounts, and before patch 3.1, a pinata raid. They also received 2 new instances.<br />
<br />
So I could really, REALLY care less on who got what from Blizzard. Sometimes both casual players and raiders sound like bickering siblings trying to figure out who daddy (Blizz) loves more and complains when they think they aren't the loved one. But both don't realize that they get the same treatment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
then why the hell make the +15 skill boots!? something's fishy here... &lt;&gt;&lt;<br />
<br />
i guess the ring is just an excuse to keep people coming to the tournament regardless of the fact that the +15 fishing from the boots has no real use with our current max needed fishing skill of 575, and the max possible more like 612. <br />
<br />
still, i really hope my quote up above was blizzard kidding, NO NEED FOR + TO FISHING SKILL AT ALL!?!? i have just about all the good + to fishing skill gear now except the +5 boots. the whole point of the skill is that if you level it to the cap and put on a lure, you CAN CATCH FISH THERE. if you get more + to fishing skill, you can catch MORE fish there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Difference here is that Blizzard is scheduling a fishing contest while knowing that most guilds raid at 8pm (again, its a more common time than it is a common day).<br />
<br />
It is like a hockey rink with two leagues: one plays all games Wednesday night, one Thursday nights. This rink decides to provide free individual skills training on Wednesday night and only Wednesday night. If you choose to go play hockey with your team on Wednesday night, you stay on team. If you choose to get individual skills training, you get kicked off your Wednesday night team.<br />
<br />
Happen to be on a Thursday night team? Good for you, win-win.</div></div><hr />

I agree about all the whining, I find it hilarious how ICC isn't enough for the raiders. They want their new raid, shiny new weapons, mounts, titles AND the fishing tournament too. Can't have -every- thing, the casual players need something to do when the rest of us are raiding.</div></div><hr />

I agree with you partly on this, it is kind of ... well stupid to make it this way. On that note though, there are people who don't want to fish ONLY in the poles, they are trying to catch other things or maybe to lazy to keep jumping from pool to pool. They are the ones that will still need the +?? to their fishing in order to avoid trash.<br />
<br />
Also those people in the sewers of Dalaran trying for the Giant Sewer Rat, Those around the fountain that want their Titanium Seal of Dalaran, and everyone that likes to fish outside VH. :O Not a lot of people but some will still need that + to finish.</div></div><hr />

I seriously doubt they are going to allow people with no fishing skill whatsoever to catch every fish in the game - that would completely devalue the whole profession and there would be no point in it. They might as well send you 10 of every fish every Monday and be done with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wednesday at 8pm is a bit silly. In fact, Wednesday is stupid full stop as it's the day that the raids reset therefore logically the day that most people will be raiding.<br />
<br />
Ah well. If it comes to it I'll just take a day off raiding every now and then to try and get the contest done.<br />

Nice to see a better way of getting rep with the Kalu'ak as the previous 3 dailies were a bit tedious.</div></div><hr />

Step 1: Make multiple levels of raiding so that everyone can be raiders!<br />
<br />
Step 2: Introduce content that raiders can not attend. <br />

Seriously though, I'm saddened that I won't ever get to do it, but its not that big of a deal, I can't go to the moon either! It does seem contrary to Blizzards &quot;everything for everyone&quot; approach recently though. <br />
<br />
And cheers to Blizzard for not just cheapening it with another pet reward that no one would ever use. Portal boots to BB much cooler.<br />

They could maybe do the event on several nights a week but make it a weekly hand in so you could only do it once a week anyway.<br />

Can I have what you are smoking? Last time I checked, VoA has become the Raider's pinata. The only time it was ever for casuals was when it was just Archavon. Now it's become gear check this, gear check that. I would have to think that if it was for casuals, that wouldn't happen. But hey, what would I know, I'm stuck in this icky place between casuals and raiders. But I do know two things about this issue:<br />
<br />
First, raiders throughout this expansion have 8 different raids. Awesome mounts that can only be obtained by raiding. Awesome gear that can only be obtained by raiding. The epic final fight against the Lich King. An awesome fight in the airships. And you are crying over heroic emblems and a fishing event? That's like the spoiled kid that gets everything but a cat. <br />
<br />
Second, stop playing the whole &quot;Normal raids = Casual Paradise&quot; self gratification crud. We all know that when ICC and 3.3 comes out, your guild will most likely run the normal raid first and the heroic second. But then, by definition, that would probably make you a casual, right? <br />
<br />
Seriously, we get the ICC raid and we are complaining about a simple fishing event? Come on, just enjoy the patch.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, you might raid on Wed at 8 (I do) but not everyone does. Although, everyone will complain about everything Blizzard does ever, so it's no use trying to talk sense into anyone. Everyone's a critic...<br />
<br />
I know that I just may have enough time to catch the shark before we pull anyways... for once, sitting on my ass waiting for raids to start that supposedly &quot;start&quot; at 8 won't be so bad. =D <br />
<br />
<br />
The two parts in bold are self contradictory. How can everyone participate if lots of people can't participate?<br />
<br />
The only real conclusion is that this time was chosen specifically to exclude a lot of people in raiding guilds. They could quite easily accomodate everyone by just having the event run every 6th day or every 8th day instead of every week. That way everyone can find some times that suit them.</div></div><hr />

i'll state again, blizzard (probably) chose the timeslot because it was when the majority of players would/could be online. that's a logical decision to make.<br />

if indeed the majority of raiders do want to go to the fishing tournament, then they'll reschedule their raid time right? because the majority of the guild want to go, right?<br />

Sucks that I work late on that day sometimes though, but I'm glad I don't raid tues/weds anymore.<br />

I actually like having more RNG in this version, people were starting to abuse guilds/friends on the BB contest to harass the better known fishermen and that was on PvE servers. (or just harass &quot;everyone but entitled GM/officer/clique-queen of the week&quot;)<br />
I don't want to think about the 'tap and run' hold-in-combat cowardfest that some PvP server BB events can be.<br />
<br />
Turning in at dalaran is pro, having to come early to BB and set hearth got annoying quick.<br />
<br />
BoA is win as well, I hogged the BB fishing tourney 6 times on my main server (4 poles, 2 trinkets) before the achievements came out and every tard in the world decided it was a must have.

this is pretty narrowed down to either fishing skill will be completely removed (as 1 skill would have the same effeciency as 612) and just everyone can fish.<br />
<br />
or, there is hope, those boots have +15 fishing skill. if they're removing the fishing skill progress, why make THAT detail? that's either a pitiful human error, or, OR they're going to make higher fishing skill do something else. probably decrease the casting time of the channeled &quot;Fishing&quot; or something<br />
<br />
short, SHORT version:<br />
Blizzard either plans to <br />
-completely remove the fishing skill, giving it automatically to all players <br />
-or plans on altering it in a way that the &quot;trash&quot; from fishing (sickly fish, driftwood) being removed still leaves a different use for high fishing skill. <br />
-or, now that i think of it, that can be interpreted as they're going back on their decision of trash drops, and are resuming the old &quot;your fish got away!&quot; messages. meh, maybe. ::)</div></div><hr />

guess you missed the part saying you will never miss regaurdless of level in a pool if you use the lure.<br />
<br />
It is said that these sharks’ favorite meal are the bite-sized Pygmy Suckerfish. Perhaps a hook in their waters will do the trick. Because of the increased concentration of fish, you have an increased chance to catch a shark from fishing pools.

I think this idea sounds great. And, it's nice for those of us on pvp servers, who find the STV contest to be daunting. Not that pvp won't come into play in Northrend, too, but at least it's one more chance a week. And, from what I've read, it seems as if you can fish the Blacktip Shark out of any pools and even out of open water (albeit, with a smaller chance.) But, that means less risk of pvp.<br />
<br />
I'm not a raider, so the time doesn't really have too great of an effect on me. On the other hand, needing to hearth back to Dalaran, to turn in the Blacktip Shark, does. I don't know about other players, but I'm pretty sure that I'm not alone in having plenty of lag in Dal. And, zoning into it is really rough, too. I wonder if there's not something that could be changed, due to how many people might have similar problems.<br />
<br />
I read some posts of others who were equally concerned. And, one mentioned the idea of getting some sort of item from the NPC in Dal and using it to summon the NPC to your side, when you caught the shark. That way, each person could just summon the NPC to themselves when they needed him, rather than having to risk the lag of Dal. Seems like a fair idea.<br />
<br />
Obviously, certain stipulations would be needed on the item. Like, that it was only able to be used during the time of the derby, so no one used it as a secondary hearth. But, seems doable.</div></div><hr />

I can almost guarantee this is is another combination of forum combing and blizzards on the phone retention departments data.<br />
<br />
new guy who started 2 weeks ago without help<br />
blizz customer service rep(csr): &quot;may I ask you why you are cancelling your account today?&quot;<br />
newbie: &quot;the game is too complicated you have all these strange things and no direction the tips are useless and people in chat are jerks&quot;<br />
csr clicks the &quot;over complicated&quot; box on their computer, goes off to a database, gets reported as a 18% cancellation reason, blizzard revamps levels 1-20 to make it easier to understand, classes are streamlined to help determine playstyle within 10 levels instead of waiting till level 50(new starting loot, new tutorial system, even easier early leveling experience)<br />
<br />
Now experience number 2 that I have seen tons of in my gaming world<br />
through out the end of bc and even worse throughout wrath the 14 million down to 11 million players has decimated night time on us servers.<br />
<br />
I've watched tons of people quit the game because their shift changed and they have nothing to do because they don't get home till 10:30, so same roleplay<br />
<br />
veteran wow player wanting to raid: I want to cancel my account<br />
csr: why is that<br />
vet: game is dead, no one raids anymore, no one group pvps anymore when I play, people are online, those that didn't get into raid pugged because anyone can nowadays. And the rest are busy doing their dailies and a heroic or 2.<br />
csr checks the &quot;unable to do content&quot; box on their computer.<br />
<br />
dev team: ok so when do we want to do this? Well 6% of cancelled accounts are due to unable to do content/time constraints so lets change it up a bit. make sure everyone can do this. <br />
<br />
<br />
This was more of a rant than i meant it to be about how tough it is a night time, guilds fixing that by moving to oceanic server(happens to the top night time guild every year on my server. been in multiple) so its our time, but reguardless blizzards retention department, im sure, has a much larger impact on patch content than the official forum qq.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping cata does what I'm sure blizzard is intending, getting players back who quit, they'll bring their friends, and they make it exciting enough to be worth doing.</div></div><hr />

That was probably the worst whining post I've ever read. You say that just because you raid five days á week, the derby should be moved? The items aren't even ment to upgrade your gear, they're for alts and other stuff. <br />
<br />
You can't participate in the derby? Tough luck. No 5% experience increase for your alts. It's not like you need that extra 1 every 20 experience. You've been able to level just fine with just 20%, and even without any at all, so what's the big deal?<br />
<br />
If you're so desperate about winning, go get someone to replace your spot in the raid so you'll have a chance of getting that ring, don't come whining about how casuals are ruining the game.</div></div><hr />

Wow just wow.... I raid on a wednesday, thursday, sunday and monday roster from 8-12 and because I choose to be part of a successful guild I don't deserve to participate in external content? I don't care about the loot rewards I will be honest but I would like to complete the event at least once.<br />
<br />
There is no need to get so angry about anything in this game because it's just that it's a game, if something pisses you off then walk away from it don't get fired up and abuse people.<br />
<br />
Just my two cents.<br />
<br />
Also thank you Blizz for adding an option for my alts to get Kal'uak rep I would hate to do that grind a third time.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard provides us with content. Gives the player some new way to spend some time in the game with something new. Well it's not innovative new (at least it sounds pretty much like BB event) but still it's new and that is great!<br />
<br />
So here comes the impressive part: people find a way to complain about it!<br />
It's amazing.<br />
<br />
In real life I could imagine it like this:<br />
Guy: &quot;Sir, you just won a free ride to Paris!&quot;<br />
Gamer: &quot;Uh..yeah &quot;great&quot; Paris. Have you been there? It sucks. I mean come on, what the fuck? What would I want in Paris? I mean I'm not complaining right now but no one wants to go to Paris, right? How about..London.. I mean that would be the least that I can expect..not shitty Paris. Come on are you stupid? Don't people like you get fired for such stupid stuff? Pff..free ride to Paris..idiot.&quot;<br />
<br />
I mean it's not like it is progression or something you definitly need to do. It's just some little fun addition to the game. It's fun. It's a game. And this part, the fishing derby, is the part of the game that is definitly most game-like of all (in contrast to arena/tournament and raiding to some extent).<br />
<br />
Please guys, stop lamenting about everything that is added to the game.<br />
If you have constructive criticism for a new feature..no one stops you.<br />
But if you just complain about the time that the event is done it is nothing more then whining. (For the simple reason that I could complain they should move BB derby or raid lockout reset to another day/time because it doesn't fit everyone. But it doesn't work this way!)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well first off, constructive criticism is never written in 50% caps. ;)<br />
Second, suggest it to the devs in the official forums<br />
Third, expect more crying and complaining because still not everyone can do it and they demand more changes which ends in just getting everything thrown after them. There is not the option to just not have that thing or adjust your schedule if you really really have to get this thing for some reason. No it must be served to you on a golden plate at the time you want.<br />
<br />
To make this clear, I wouldn't care if they implement this idea when this is what most people fits, so don't take my first point too serious :)</div></div><hr />

...<br />
<br />
That's what it's about. I hope the discussion in this thread really opened some eyes. It sure opened mine.<br />
First they wanted everyone to have everything instant after dinging 80 (and they got it in Wotlk) and now they say that it is perfectly ok that no hardcore raider will ever have a opportunity to get the fishing rewards (as long as they can get them). I could not post a better definition of greediness here...<br />

Considering the ability to fly its maybe over faster. Consider this for the &quot;QQ level 1 can complete the daily&quot; Yes they can but they have a great disadvandage (including getting raped by mobs in the zone)</div></div><hr />

I only read about raiders complaining that it doesn't fit their schedule. And they should be able to get it.<br />
Do you mean, because people who don't have time to play in the afternoon now get chance to complete the master angler (in the evening), this is catering the casuals?<br />
I'm confused.<br />
<br />
There is a reason why &quot;great&quot; movies on television aren't shown in the afternoon but in the evening. Think about that.</div></div><hr />

&quot;They&quot; are the people that say that this time is just perfect (as no hardcore raider can participate then). Hell some even say that raiders should not have a opportunity to participate as raiders already have &quot;uber epics&quot; from hardcore raiding.<br />
<br />
Its greediness, nothing more, nothing less.</div></div><hr />

Sigh, the greediness of people. What would be a good midweek time then that would be just enough for every one? Cause if they lower it then you get the people complaining about their jobs and dinner. If it's raised then it will be too late to people. So I dunno. Maybe a rotation of Kalu'ak and STV on their current days would be nice.</div></div><hr />

As said before there are many perfect times like for example on tuesdays in EU or on weekends or at 18:00 or something like this. There are plenty of better opportunities.<br />
But I think everyone (even Blizzard should know that...) knows that Wed 20:00 is the time where most people are raiding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But it's no or less greediness from your side wanting this item at all ..oh wait.. at no (time!) cost? This is a hypocrisy!<br />
<br />
Sorry your definition of greed is very strange. What you mean is grudge.. maybe jealousy. Still I don't agree with you. If you really really really want this..then you can't raid this day or have to postpone the raid to 20:30. But actually..you don't need it, do you?<br />
If you have a better idea than &quot;make it 15:00 like BB derby&quot; post it in the official forums as suggestion.<br />
<br />
To get this straigt, everything before 19:00 is fucking stupid for working people! I don't know if the concept of &quot;prime time (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_time)&quot; is common in the united states (I just read it originated from there :D). <br />
It basically says that you show your best stuff in TV at around 20:00 (it's 20:15 mostly in germany for movies and such. Even good running sitcoms and cartoons like Simpsons and South Park) because you get most audience then..I guess this maybe changes from country to country (I could think of spain..they work strange hours there..don't they?). But normal work is at least til around 18:00, right?<br />
This is the most obvious reason why they made it 20:00.</div></div><hr />

It is not about me wanting to participate in the derby but I just found some posts in this thread very interesting (also shocking) and wanted to point these out to &quot;them&quot; as mentioned before.<br />

They are not preventing you, your schedule is. It is not correct from *them* to say &quot;You don't deserve to participate&quot; but it's also not correct from you to say &quot;Blizzard prevents me from participating&quot;. If your schedule prevents you from participating than it's like this. Many players (work)schedule prevents them from participating at BB derby and many other things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem here is that it is not about a personal schedule, it is common knowledge that almost every single hardcore raider is raiding on Wed 20:00. As said before there are plenty of other times where many more people could participate but for some strange reason &quot;they&quot; find it perfectly ok that real hardcore raiders will not have a opportunity to participate.<br />
<br />
And as mentioned above I am neither a hardcore raider nor am I interested in participating in the derby, I just wanted to point out the shocking posts in this thread.</div></div><hr />

I think it's as shocking as the fact that the hardcore raiders demand it being another time of day, basically &quot;serving&quot; it to them..while they are the ones who complain about that everything is served to the players (omglol ez raids. free epix).<br />
Other than that..if a player is sooo hardcore into raiding that he can't get that wednesday off (or later..maybe the complete raid wants the derby..so they can take turns, everyone wins a week and they start raiding later on wednesday)..then he doesn't want that achievement/ring that hard.</div></div><hr />

It's old and all but from experience (I've used heirlooms for my alts) I can tell you that chest and shoulder stack - hell they even stack with the 300% of RaF and that is a huge boost -&gt; 363%</div></div><hr />

@ topic:<br />
I may be wrong, but if you spend the time wasted on fishing for that special shark on leveling your alt instead, wouldn't that make up for your loss of XP gain due to your alt not having the ring?<br />
Unless you plan on leveling several alts (which I doubt with Icecrown not too far ahead :) )</div></div><hr />

<br />
-without trash drops, since we can fish everywhere already, a level 1 fisherman would have the same ability to fish as a maxed out 612 skill fisherman. (or whatever the cap was, around there)<br />
<br />
-without trash drops, they plan on replacing this mechanic with something else that would cause + fishing skill to benefit a fisherman. this makes more sense, as during the same patch they are adding +15 skill boots as a reward to the derby<br />
<br />
-without trash drops, they're simply reversing to the previous process, which was &quot;Your Fish Got away!&quot; as the result of a failed cast. <br />
<br />
really hope confirmation shows up in the 3.3 patch notes or something, i want to know if that little sentence means the entire skill is getting an overhaul or being virtually scrapped.</div></div><hr />

:o :o :o :o :o :o<br />
<br />
then why the hell make the +15 skill boots!? something's fishy here... &lt;&gt;&lt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Because when it comes to lvling SW and Ogrimmar have a shitload of fishpools.<br />
<br />
Also, it has never been said that the fish lvl one scale with skill lvl you know, it's only been said you CANNOT catch junk in a fish pool. Some read it as 100% fish/trunk/special loot drop. I also read it as Fishing in Northrend with a 10 fishing skill will get you ''No fish on hook'' very often.</div></div><hr />

Most guilds have offdays at some point, with a rotating schedule they at least have a chance. 8PM on Wednesdays? That's just ridiculous, even the casuals are busy :P<br />
<br />
If they are trying to make the servers less congested on reset day they are taking the wrong approach.<br />

I think this isn't just hardcore raiders, but large population of the European raiding guilds. Even players from average raiding guilds are likely to have to completely pass on this due to raiding schedule.<br />
<br />
Not personally fussed, I've never even participated in the STV equivalent, but I can understand what the people here are talking about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So the only thing you see is rewards? Guess what, there are some people out there that do not only play for rewards but they want to have fun (e.g. participate in the fishing derby).<br />

You're kidding!? People don't play this game for rewards? Colour me flabbergasted.<br />
<br />
I can see where you come from, though. Fishing isn't exactly fun for me, so I can't say I see any point other than it's rewards. Guess I was just venting, probably could've just kept it to myself. On that note, respectfully withdrawn.<br />
<br />
And if you were by any chance wondering what I do find fun in WoW, it's raiding, hands down. I love the feeling of getting a hard mode down for the first time. PvP occasionally, but that flusters me a bit since I suck a lot at it.<br />

<br />
http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=20677630906&amp;postId=206757811322&amp;sid=1#0<br />
<br />
I was reading about the new Kalu'ak fishing tournament and noted the complaints of several at MMO-Champion, which I thought seemed meaningful and applied to both tournaments: <br />
<br />
- The reward cap: 52 winners a year, all of which could be one person. (I've heard on some servers, the same person wins BB every week, brags and deletes/DEs/vendors the rewards.) <br />
<br />
- The time: Booty Bay Fishing Extravaganza conflicts with many church/family obligations. The Kalu'ak Fishing Derby conflicts with BOTH family/church obligations and raiding for most serious guilds. <br />
<br />
- The methods of winning: tends to involve griefing/PvP/teleportation/group effort, all of which run contrary to the spirit of fishing. People who fish generally set out to avoid a lot of these things. The point of fishing is to &quot;get away from it all&quot;. <br />
<br />
Suggestion: Utilize existing game mechanics to preserve the &quot;feel&quot; of a fishing competition in a way that is more inclusive of people with diverse/fixed schedules, places fewer limitations on winners and places the emphasis more squarely on the fundamentals of fishing. <br />
<br />
- Have the fishing tournaments as quests that reset periodically, similar to the Brewfest keg runs which reset in 12 or 16 hours. This allows people to do it on their own schedule without simply being able to do it at any time. My suggestion would be a 3 hour cooldown to allow people to try out various times of day. <br />
<br />
- Have the spawns be limited. For instance, maybe only one pool spawns in each zone every 15 minutes which has a chance to contain a shark for the Kalu'ak derby. (However, a new one spawns if the one gets looted.) In turn, BBFE &quot;Tastyfish pools&quot; could spawn at a limited rate, say one every five minutes... With the additional modifier that a new one spawns every time a tastyfish is looted. <br />
<br />
- Have the quest items (tastyfish/shark) be items that disappear if you are summoned, if you teleport or hearth. You wanna do it, you have to use traditional travel. This balances things out more between classes and group vs. solo. <br />
<br />
- Create a factor similar to the timed Strat runs. Introduce &quot;celebrity&quot; NPC competitors who appear to taunt you. In a random amount of time, somewhere between fifteen and thirty minutes, one of these NPCs will automatically win. You must beat them through luck and skilled pool hunting. While you are competing for players for pool spawns, another player &quot;winning&quot; will not prevent you from &quot;winning&quot;. However, an NPC winning WILL prevent you from winning. <br />
<br />
- Introduce a grindable currency/badge system for competing and not winning. Winning is always one part luck but competing often shows, at least, dedication. Grinding IS GOOD and worthy of some reward. Obviously, skill/luck will eliminate some of the need for grinding but if grinding doesn't eventually equal the value of the skill/luck-based rewards here, people will ignore the competition and focus on other aspects of the game where grinding is more appropriately rewarded. <br />
<br />
I propose &quot;Badge of the Angler&quot; currency be implemented for both fishing contests as a reward you get for completing it, whether or not you do it in the time limit. These badges could be turned in for: <br />
<br />
- A Waterwalking FLASK, Binds on Pickup (ie. longer duration) <br />
<br />
- High-powered Bait (say, +150 fishing), Binds to Account <br />
<br />
- Faction-themed Fishing Poles (The Argent Tournament Lances, reworked a bit, bought with a mix of Angler badges and honor)<br />
<br />
- A re-skinned fishing chair. They're releasing the TCG Turtle and Rocket mounts reskinned and they did the same for the picinic basket. <br />
<br />
- An heirloom ring, similar to the Kalu'ak Derby winning reward. Only +3% XP increase instead of +5%. <br />
<br />
- A murloc pet. Fishing pole and hat equipped. <br />
<br />
- A sea lion mount. Aquatic speed +60%. <br />
<br />
- &quot;Swifty the Dark War Tortoise of Impending Doom&quot; A 100% ground speed (0% aquatic speed) tortoise, bought for a mix of Angler marks and BG marks. The idea is a tortoise model mount for everyone... But without the special water functionality. Because this turtle is so fast on land, &quot;Swifty&quot; seems like an appropriate name that doubles as a nod to the warrior class PvP &quot;guru&quot; Swifty -- who first gained prominence for using the &quot;Skull of Impending Doom&quot; to zip around at insane speeds, ignoring crowd control. Once learned, the buff for the mount would simply read &quot;Tortoise of Impending Doom.&quot; <br />
<br />
Once the fishing tournaments are tweaked a bit, I'd also like to see similar competitions of other types incorporated, like a Nessingway Safari and Northrend Nessingway Safari... and maybe a race of some kind for each continent, launching hourly and with key checkpoints, requiring you to race around each continent without zoning, flightpaths, portals or teleportation and arrive at a destination on the opposite end of the continent first.</div></div><hr />

That is where our opinions differ.<br />
<br />
Scrubs that have no intention of ever doing a days labour in their life should never be considered as &quot;people&quot;.<br />

Maybe you live in an area where you do not experience things like this (or are simply ignorant to them like our governments), but if you had such experiences thrusted upon you i am sure your outlook would be close, if not identical to mine.<br />

It's fine by me I don't even do Stranglethorn.<br />
<br />
Now I've looked through your previous posts on other threads you also make fun of and insult Jews in one of the more recent ones.<br />
<br />
There is currently a thread on Chinese homosexuals - knock yourself out with that one.<br />
<br />
It's a shame you ever came back from your last break.</div></div><hr />

The Jew post was a year ago and taken out of context from the rest of the thread. <br />

<br />
<br />
Ah, that makes sense then. I was thinking, most guilds can smoke 25 ToC and Ulduar in a 4 hour tuesday raid window, so Wednesday and beyond for the 10 man teams or Ony, if people still do that. Otherwise progression hardmodes and alt gearing. Or just plain better night for most of your team!<br />

<br />
Scrubs that have no intention of ever doing a days labour in their life should never be considered as &quot;people&quot;.<br />
<br />
They are vermin that are spreading a &quot;benefits4lyfe&quot; attitude like a disease among our younger generation.<br />
<br />
Maybe you live in an area where you do not experience things like this (or are simply ignorant to them like our governments), but if you had such experiences thrusted upon you i am sure your outlook would be close, if not identical to mine.<br />
<br />
And this is no longer about the game, it's about certain members of the community of scrubs that play it.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, what kind of conclusion can we end up drawing from behind all this blinding self-righteousness?</div></div><hr />

I would humbly suggest that you get back to the matter at hand, or simply cease to post, as I feel that sometime soon a moderator is likely to take exception to your behaviour.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fumarick</div><div class="date">2009-10-27, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think the day/time was chosen because <br />
<br />
a) it allows ppl who cant paticipate in STV because of work/raids/etcetc to have an alternative<br />
<br />
b) because they know that a majority of the players is online at that time.<br />
<br />
So all who are online, they can participate. if u prefer to do other things at that time.. well, u have to set priorities.<br />
<br />
<br />
neither the ring nor the boots are a must-have, they are nice to have. the +5% exp is not really that much, leveling was sped up alot anyway.<br />
<br />
and pro raiders who really have a military-like organized raid will have ICC clean in less then 8 weeks anyway, and once they start twinking again, and yelling for more content, they can do the fishing contest after they raid ICC 24/7.<br />
<br />
<br />
i dont raid for items, and i dont chose my guild for progress. i do it all for fun. if u get kicked from your guild because u ask for a 30min delay of the raid, then u r in the wrong guild, thats my opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you serious -_-, any decent guild with people who raid not to stand waiting around on people know that you just don't mess each other around with silly AFK's. And to be honest you are totally in the right guild if you get a &quot;slap&quot; for taking a 30min break in the middle of a raid but then again I guess it depends if your guild finds TOC normal uber hard or breezes through to what your attitude to raiding is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but i'll never ever ever ever get to do this tournament because every guild who is somewhat half decent RAIDS every wednesday from 19-20, and no i cant just skip a raid here and there, there is no wai i'll get to see this tournament unless they change the time. <br />
<br />
17:00 a thursday would be good, most ppl have finished the raids if they're just doing ony/toc each week so there will be less lagg in Northrend and ppl can choose to participate without having to leave a raid.<br />

<br />
Who goes to Booty Bay anymore?<br />
<br />
Christ what a failure of an event, an heirloom and once-per-day hearth boots.<br />
<br />
Explain to me how this crap compares to the best fishing pole in the game and something that turns say a rogue into a speedy stealthed fish at the tap of a trinket?<br />
<br />
Sheesh, talk about exciting alt-grinders and sucking the fun out of it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It’s not a PVP heirloom ring… there is no resilience on it.<br />
<br />
It’s a leveling ring…full of stats you need while you level<br />
<br />
Stamina = Good for leveling <br />
<br />
Crit = Good for leveling<br />
<br />
Hit = Good for leveling as you don’t find a lot of it on leveling gear and always need at least 5% never to miss on a mob of your level.<br />
<br />
+5% Exp from mobs and quests = Awsome.<br />
<br />
Anyone who ever plans to level Any alt would find this Ring very useful.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Boots seem like they will be useful in Cata (assuming Booty-Bay survives).<br />
The whole X-pac takes place in Old World. <br />
<br />
And anyone who as ever tried to win the BB fishing tourney knows they only way to compete is to set your hearthstone at the BB tavern….(which is a pain in the ass).<br />
<br />
If you have these boots , you don’t have to do that anymore.</div></div><hr />

I just don't believe this, except maybe for the raid organizers (even there I would dare to say there is some degree of freedom). I admit that when I still raided as part of the organization team, I had some trouble with the Booty Bay contest timing myself, but then I just used those times where there were more than 25 people (actually at the time it was 40) available, and chose to be on &quot;reserve&quot;.<br />
<br />
My guess is that all the whiners about the time here are more about the &quot;I want to have it first on my server&quot; type than they are actually worried about not getting it at all :)<br />
<br />
I think it is a cool idea and I LOVED the booty bay contest (at least before it was made an achievement and everyone and their brothers participated just for that).</div></div><hr />

This particular QQ fest would be resolved easily if they rescheduled the event away from prime raiding hours. <br />

ahahahah<br />
well come on then, make a suggestion :D</div></div><hr />

Alternatively, you could have it scheduled anytime during Saturday afternoon/evening, or even coinciding with the BB Fishing Extravaganza to make players choose which rewards they would rather go for.<br />
<br />
<br />
running close to/at the same time of the bb contest is an interesting idea, but i get the feeling that blizzard gave this new comp a weekday timeslot in order to give people who can't ordinarily make a weekend timeslot a chance :D<br />
<br />
with that in mind, that leaves us with your 5pm suggestion - that's not too hot for anyone that has a fulltime job, but of course i dont have that sort of info; do you think there's more people with an 8pm raid schedule than fulltime jobs?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bobm</div><div class="date">2009-10-28, 05:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I already did. 5 PM, any day of the week.

<br />
<br />
Unfortunately 5PM wouldn't work either, unless you work from home (or not at all) or live 2minutes from work... one word... traffic.<br />
<br />
To ensure that *everybody* can do this it should be changed from every Wednesday to every 4-5 days, as someone earlier in this thread suggested.<br />
This would mean that it would go Wed-&gt;Sun-&gt;Thu-&gt;Mon etc. or something.<br />
<br />
This wouldn't be hard to do, and I don't think that every raider raids 7 nights a week (i sure as hell don't).<br />
So eventually the cycle will go around to a day when you're free. <br />
<br />
Everybody wins. Everybody can have a chance to do it.<br />
Easy.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fumarick</div><div class="date">2009-10-28, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">my guess is that blizzard knows -better than most ppl on the forums- when the players are online and raiding etc.<br />
<br />
they will have checked it. no one has real ingame statistics concerning online status etc, only blizzard does.<br />
<br />
maybe it went like this:<br />
<br />
dev: ok, so when do we do this new event? it would be cool to let ppl who cant compete in STV event get their chance too!<br />
<br />
stat man: hmm, lets see.. most ppl are online on weekends, but there is alot of raiding too.<br />
<br />
dev: ok, what other dates do we have, where alot of ppl are on?<br />
<br />
stat man: hmm lets see, wednesday 8pm looks fine. alot of ppl online, but most of them are just idling around in dalaran and crying about &quot;never play on patchday&quot; and posong with their last-id-loot!<br />
<br />
dev: kk, so lets do it wednesday evening.<br />
<br />
<br />
@all: remember, this is ptr only. i guess IF they find out that there will be an issue with the time of the event on the live-servers, they will change it.<br />
<br />
<br />
but, imho, it will be like always.. alot of crying, but in the end, all will do the contest anyway. some sooner, some later.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krysia</div><div class="date">2009-10-28, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's no way to ensure that *everybody* gets a chance to do it. That is, however, no reason to put it on a time which is fundamentally terrible for a huge chunk of the players of this game. <br />
<br />
<br />
Ofc there is, as I suggested earlier simply do a rotating schedule. They might not be able to do it every week but sometime they will.<br />
Even if the time was the same (8PM) most people would be able to participate once or twice in a seven week cycle seeing as most guilds have offdays.<br />
Unless you do sports every single day at 8PM or something, most people should be able to attend sometime.<br />
<br />
With a static 8PM wednesday slot it's practically impossible for most people to go.<br />
<br />
Or maybe they want a lower participation to ensure that even the hardcore casuals have a chance of winning? :P</div></div><hr />

Just like raiding is optional :P<br />
<br />
The attitude here stinks of 'make it accessible to all who play' yet when Blizzard do try and cater for this attitude it gets hit with 'you have debased the game' <br />
