Community Interviews Exorsus and Enigma<br />
We've updated World of Warcraft's five-year anniversary site to include two fansite interviews.<br />
<br />
Exorsus, currently the third best guild in the world, is also the top Russian and former top European guild. We met Viksh, its leader, to talk about how the guild was created, what makes it different from others, and how a team should be ruled to be efficient.<br />
<br />
In the second interview, we speak with Fraya, the leader of the Enigma guild on the Deathwing realm, about his most memorable moments over five years of playing, Enigmaâ€™s experience in high-end raiding, and where the guild expects to find itself in Cataclysm and beyond.<br />
<br />
Check out the anniversary site to read the full interviews.<br />

Tanking Stats<br />
Stamina is always going to be valuable for tanks, so I'm not sure a strategy of trying to force tanks to gem / enchant other stats is ever going to feel good. That said, tanks used to worry more about being the mana sponge. The way to alleviate being the mana sponge is to take less damage and a great way to take less damage is to dodge more.<br />
<br />
The relative value of dodge vs. parry is something we'll have to play with. My gut reaction is that parry needs to be cheaper since avoiding 100% of one hit is more valuable than avoiding 50% of two hits, but I'm not sure how much cheaper. Avoiding spikiness (which dodge will contribute to) also has value, and if the second hit after a parry is dodged instead (such that you lose the parry &quot;charge&quot;) that plays into the cost as well.<br />
<br />
The passive talent tree bonuses for tanks will probably be something like 1) reduces damage taken, 2) increases damage done, 3) reduces damage taken in a way unique to your tree.<br />
<br />
Yes, we're still dodging the DK question. For now. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/23710460920-mastery-for-tanks.html))<br />
<br />
1v1 Balance - Healer vs DPS<br />
I think my point there was that the healer will eventually run out of mana. If they are able to damage you while healing themselves though, they will likely win.<br />
<br />
It comes down to this: If a healer can't beat a dps one on one, then there is no way a healer will be able to keep an entire three-person team alive. In that scenario you might as well just run with 3 dps and there becomes no role for the healer in Arena teams.<br />
<br />
Note: this does not mean that in every single case that a dps spec defeats a healing spec in a duel that there is a problem with the class. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23710551636-question-about-1v1-balance.html))<br />

<br />
makes every 1.25 minute cooldown from bladestorm fucking bullshit, because you can get disarmed on it all.<br />
<br />
thats means 1.25 cooldown on some burst (and yeah i know its alot on cloth, but on higher rating it doesnt kill anyone that easy:P)<br />
and then you get a instant disarm, which is quite easy with atleast 2 BS classes able to disarm.. -.-<br />
Mage / shadowpriest disarms ftl.<br />

anyway, i really hope it doesnt go live. coz that would make arms fucking bullshit, or atleast, kinda</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not crying about being Nerfed, unrelenting assault 75% ms is completly ridiculous, but Disarm under bladestorm? Can anyone tell me the logic behind that?<br />
<br />
It doesn't help locks or priest to survive warriors AT ALL, they dont have any disarm effects (except shadows, but they already shit on warriors, so i dont think they care).<br />
<br />
Theres no logic behind that, i'm starting to believe ghostcrawler has a pot full of nerfs idea and he just pick one randomly every now and then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
this is making the ability useless in every bg / arena with atleast 1 class able to disarm... -.-<br />
as said before, it will turn into a hand of freedom instead of a burst dmg ability.<br />
<br />
and its BS that it does so much dmg, its 1 ability, with a medium long cooldown, providing some heavy dmg. but it can be countered on various ways.<br />
- sprint / shields / bubbles / pain suppression / swap 1h + shield / cat form + dash / travel form / disengage / vanish / evasion / death grip (to save someone) / deterrence.<br />
<br />
i think i made my point, bladestorm isnt as strong as people say it is.. its not that hard to avoid dmg from it. apart from the fact that some CC, deep freeze for example, can fuck you up with it.<br />
<br />
but almost every warrior is playing with a healer, so that kind of CC wont be around against you.<br />
<br />
There is really no use in changing bladestorm as it is, coming from a warrior i know. but maybe its time to check out priest, 9k dmg absorbing shields + penance (OMG 1 FULL CHANNELING SPELL AND MY TARGET IS HEALED ZOMG ZOMG) so.. stop whining about warriors</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm pretty sure most warriors already put points into that, at least all the ones I've seen have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Then it still means that 3-4 seconds of your bladestorm is wasted.. making it 2 whirlwind effects of around 3-4k dmg, total 8-9k dmg..<br />
dont think that will really improve anything..<br />
Elemental shamans in full resto gear doing 11k lava burst... while healing their buddy -.-<br />
<br />
so even with that talent, bladestorm is more or less a waste of a 1,5 min cooldown.</div></div><hr />

Generally, yeah. It's time consuming enough to get a 'good' PvP weapon, let alone two so we could switch back and forth for disarm teams.</div></div><hr />

Forgetting that the change is kinda harsh , maybe a dmg nerf was in place ( A LONG LONG time ago) but this just means I can protect my healer for once as rogue against a warrior with all cds up.

TBH the priest is the core of the RMP team setup ( PI , shield , Pain supression saving my butt ) , but I accept your opinion . Still something must be done to the dmg of this game ( for everyone from rogues , warriors , etc) . Even with resil buff , dmg is again over the top . It is to late in the xpac for them to do any decent changes so they patch the leaks with things like this .

2 ,5 ,5 min , great counters bro . I won't even take evasion /cloak seriously , every decent rogue uses feint at BS , in most cases it's enough as all it's dmg is AOE.<br />
Practically you are defending the fact that you could take down a priest in a 3v3 arena with next to nothing I could do to even help him?( No pain supression and shield makes no fuckin difference) . I destroy some teams myself as RMP but I am arguing my cause here . <br />
Also ain't you got that weapon chain enchant that could make this change nul?use it.</div></div><hr />

You seem to be angry about warriors getting nerfed.<br />

Oh and I wasn't talking about counters to Bladestorm. I was talking about abilities that can't be stopped. You want a good counter to Bladestorm? Run away.</div></div><hr />

Still something must be done to the dmg of this game ( for everyone from rogues , warriors , etc) . Even with resil buff , dmg is again over the top . It is to late in the xpac for them to do any decent changes so they patch the leaks with things like this . I ain't buying Cata till I see first season ain't the same as Season 5 &gt;.&lt;<br />
<br />
<br />
I fully accept that the damage in season 7 was nutty and even more disturbing now. There are counter-classes, and for most of WoW's existence the warrior was the counter-class to Warlocks, Priests, and Rogues. Now we call a rogue bad if he loses to a warrior. I know things change, I know to adapt. I just think this change...fuck it, I'mma copypasta what I wrote in another thread...<br />
While most of us really do understand the intent, it's the method of application that is just silly. This is almost as silly as using the frost mage as the victim of a protection warrior's rage. They chose to cast in the role of the helpless little girl the frost mage, most every warriors bane. If they wanted something close to real sympathy and understanding they should have chosen an Elemental Shaman or a Boomkin.</div></div><hr />

If rogues had some like healing from crits like leader of the pack or healing when damaging a stunned target, they'd have a bit more survivabilty and would lose to every single healer...<br />

Well first of all, stop wearing priest gear and get glock of shadows glyphe --hit more like 1k2 k crit... it's quite far from 4k..<br />

<br />
The only people I ever hear complaining about it are either not wearing PvP gear - or - don't anticipate the warrior doing it every 1,25 to 1,5 mins so they blew all their CDs on crap that didn't need a CD blown.<br />
Either case, you shouldn't be allowed to just stop it as a whole - because you had the chance to do that - if you would have anticipated it.<br />
<br />
I can imagin spinning around w/o a weapon already... against RMP for example, will bring a lot of funfrustration.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okay.. I thought I would test Live and PTR side by side.. and I have to admit. I was not amused. My live char was doing more dmg with TC with the same gear than the PTR char. I think Blizz need to rethink this one. Why not increase the amount of dmg more and increase threat as they have done with Devestate. <br />
<br />
I took the warrior to the same instance and I did the same things.. No way have the done anything for the changes to TC. if they have.. VERY VERY VERY small changes. I hope I am wrong though.</div></div><hr />

From your character feed and armory I can tell that you're just not much of a PvP player. (didn't need your armory for that, any druid that makes such a claim can't seriously mean it and be a pvper)<br />
<br />
And if you are, well, time to get wrathful pieces instead of the 1 furious piece you got about 2 months ago.<br />
<br />
Also if the gear you're wearing is partially the gear you use to PvP, well you're wearing cloth, you think bladestorm shouldn't hit hard on you, are you for real?</div></div><hr />

On the other hand, the very concept of your ultimate attack consisting of:<br />
<br />
Spinning around in circles with such speed that you can deal a great amount of damage to everything around you (and the greatest blademasters of Warcraft III capable of wrecking buildings with said technique).<br />
<br />
Doesn't work logic wise either.</div></div><hr />

I thought they were going to buff balanced druids, I guess a nerf is the same as a buff on opposite day.<br />

Now you may actually have to learn how to use it.<br />

I play a feral and I have a 3 min cooldown lasting 15 seconds which can be stunned/shieldblocked/CoI-kited/hunterkited/horrified and god knows what else. There is 3 times as much potentual for CC'ing me as there is CC'ing a BS'ing warrior.<br />
<br />
Deal with it.<br />
<br />
And yes, UA needs a nerf, too. I hope they'll wake up soon. Warrior damage is out of hand in that it is roughly as good as feral or arcane mage damage, but provides 50-75% MS on top of that. And that is despite being controlled more!<br />
<br />
If they aren't going to get their damage nerfed directly, then their mobility and IWIN buttons must be nerfed to compensate. BS is a fine start.</div></div><hr />

Because it being disarmable makes it harder to time?<br />
<br />
<br />
Pretty much every spec has their &quot;oh shit&quot; button - when they use it is up to them.<br />
<br />
I've yet to encounter any team getting &quot;lol killed in 1 gcd by bladestorm&quot; over 1200 rating.<br />
You KNOW he'll use it, you can have timers telling you when it'll be off CD roughly, you have a partner to assist you and Pre-disarm it.<br />
You can possibly OUTRUN it or LOS the warrior by jumping off an object.<br />
(and to the idiot saying you only heal 75% during bladestorm, you do realise the warrior can't overpower or do anything else while spinning? so only 50 % reduction)<br />
<br />
<br />
I know this might sound BIASED, but I don't only PvP on my warrior.<br />
As a healer in arenas, the only time I ever had trouble against bladestorm was when I didn't have enough resilience.<br />
Ever since I geared up on PvP gear, I stand there Laughing and just outheal it, I don't even have to run from it. (except for in 5V5)</div></div><hr />

Instantly Whirlwind up to 4 nearby targets and for the next 6 sec you will perform a whirlwind attack every 1 sec. While under the effects of Bladestorm, you can move but cannot perform any other abilities but you do not feel pity or remorse or fear and you cannot be stopped unless killed, or LOLDISARMED.</div></div><hr />

I wound up in an arena match holy pally vs ret pally. Took about 25 minutes, but I actually beat him. Was one of the most epic arena battles I've ever had. It was HARD stuff. had to get him to bubble, and then burn him down again before his bubble came back. Which is quite hard for a healer, while keeping yourself alive. Had to get his mana low enough that he couldnt judge to get mana back (lol).<br />
<br />
Ive beaten almost every class/spec 1v1 on my holy pally. but some (self healing DPS'ers) are terribly hard and require some luck. But hands down, almost any other class i can &quot;outlast&quot; (even if i just put up ret aura and heal myself)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes it does. It means you have to time it behind corners or out of range of the rogue, or trying to deal enough pressure before BS to force the disarm ahead of time.<br />
It means you have to assess the situation before charging in and bladestorming.<br />
<br />
And I know you can't UA while in BS. You can do it just beforehand, however, and to be honest warriors do more single target DPS outside BS than in it these days, so yeah.<br />
<br />
And yes, I do predict BS. Thing is, I often have no ways to prevent it - and in fact I still won't. If cyclone is on DR (because he forced me to CC him - see that's what I mean!) and he decides to pop his shit then I might as well just pack up and leave. In fact, me and my 2's partner at 2.4k in Cyclone BG EU often have this &quot;My bladestorm meter is ticking&quot; game going, trying to predict when warriors will Bladestorm. :P (Because they play it so terribly predictably it is decisively vomiting that it actually works for them)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not sure what comp v comp you're theorycrafting on here, but your cyclone is your prevention (depending on setup, you've also got roots), barkskin your &quot;oh shit&quot; - when you're about to hit the DR wall and are out of posibilieties, you tell your team mate - if you're in trouble - and he can assist you BEFORE the bladestorm.<br />
I know it is tiresome to (ab)use those pilars to LoS him all the time, but just cyclone -&gt; shapeshift -&gt; and do the /pilardance<br />
That is how it almost Always goes.<br />
If the warrior does get the bladestorm off and your partner is obviously late, it isn't the warrior or his damage that should take the hit/blame, it is your partners fault.<br />
<br />
Hence I do not support this nerf.</div></div><hr />

There's a difference between toning down an ability and making it useless against any team capable of disarming. Disarm-able Bladestorm is tantamount to outright banning the ability from Arena. Hit it and you're nearly guaranteed to be disarmed.<br />
<br />
I'm liking the look of the Thunderclap change. No Warrior ability should be influenced by silences. A little more crit damage, a little less chance to miss is welcome.</div></div><hr />

I know it is tiresome to (ab)use those pilars to LoS him all the time, but just cyclone -&gt; shapeshift -&gt; and do the /pilardance<br />
That is how it almost Always goes.<br />
If the warrior does get the bladestorm off and your partner is obviously late, it isn't the warrior or his damage that should take the hit/blame, it is your partners fault.<br />
<br />
Hence I do not support this nerf.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors tend to not really attempt to Bladestorm me. Did you miss the part where I play a feral? Ie. I play with a rogue or a priest ie. they bladestorm my partner. Every time. If it's a warr/pala and I am feral/priest I can handle it because the warrior is forced to go ridiculously defensive 24/7 but otherwise it's a serious pain in the butt.<br />
<br />
In the case of feral/priest vs. warr/druid: I can't pressure the warrior because he is being HoTted and my DPS relied on DoT's = nullified. There are other means of dealing with this though such as keeping the warrior peeled and switching a lot. However if I even remotely close to fuck this up just a tiny wee little bit my priest gets his head chopped off. That's really outside the scope of this discussion though as the disarm change won't do a thing, and our fear is virtually useless. (Might give the priest 2 seconds of uptime because most warriors are retardedly slow at reacting - but they quickly make up for that with a charge lol)<br />
<br />
I once got owned by Tankz, shamefully enough, because he crit my priest from 100% through a shield down to 20% seconds in BS in ~5-6 seconds. Said priest had 27k HP and 1100 resil. This was in S7. This was after I had to cyclone him 3 times beacuse all his shit procced and he ran around with 8k AP and 100% ArP completely destroying my pal's health... -.- It is only fair if such an attack can be more easily prevented.<br />
<br />
Also - doing the pillardance as a feral is a very silly tactic. Especially since BS goes THROUGH THE FUCKING PILLAR (only prevented by range). Very silly indeed.</div></div><hr />

Depending on mass / velocity this could work. But when a human hits a fast spinning Tauren, he wouldn't even notice it.<br />
<br />
<br />
hold of his weapon. <br />
<br />
You can't. If he's fast enough, he would tear your hands off. Even if you block it somehow with a shield, most likely you would just lose it and he'd continue.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cut off his wrists.<br />

That would be an Idea, but that's why he's wearing PLATE ARMOR. ;)<br />

Tbh This BS nerf is kinda silly, i play a not well pvp geared priest (shadow/disc hybrid) and i do not have a prob with BS as it is at the moment. Ofc i play only BGÂ´s at the moment cause my gear is to low arena atm. But the only time i ever have probs with BS is when i have popped my CDÂ´s earlier on while hmm lets say some pala popps avenger wrath and tries to have his way with me. <br />
<br />
Yeah yeah i know priests are OP, QQ all you got i dont care, but i play enhancement shaman and frost DK too and never had a prob with BS when i play those chars eaither. <br />

My gut reaction is that parry needs to be cheaper since avoiding 100% of one hit is more valuable than avoiding 50% of two hits, but I'm not sure how much cheaper. Avoiding spikiness (which dodge will contribute to) also has value, and if the second hit after a parry is dodged instead (such that you lose the parry &quot;charge&quot;) that plays into the cost as well.<br />
<br />
(Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/23710460920-mastery-for-tanks.html))<br />
<br />
Glad to see Parry potentially being a cheaper cost. When I heard this was 50% over 2 hits I figured I would be stacking, and as a DK I always feel as though I should be deflecting attacks with my weapons rather than stepping to the side. Unfortunately, being kind of prominent as an AoE tank has me concerned without any type of stacking buff for Parry charges meaning allowing far more damage through. Still, if the potential problem is taken into account to the extent Parry is as desirable as Dodge previously was for an avoidance stat I will be happy, especially if I can actually increase my Parry above my Dodge (seriously, even with Swordbreaking for 4% more Parry I am still percentages off...).</div></div><hr />

There is no way a warrior kills a healer in arena using bladestorm only, but it puts preasure on them. Also, it's a situational skill meaning it's not a IWIN button. Stop the whining already. if this goes live I'ma be super mad! :( Maybe I'll go back to my hybrid arms/prot specc with lots of stuns instead untill they nerf that also.</div></div><hr />

Can anyone tell me the logic behind that?<br />
<br />
It doesn't help locks or priest to survive warriors AT ALL, they dont have any disarm effects (except shadows, but they already shit on warriors, so i dont think they care).<br />
<br />
Theres no logic behind that, i'm starting to believe ghostcrawler has a pot full of nerfs idea and he just pick one randomly every now and then.<br />
<br />
Firstly, there was never disarm immunity taged to &quot;cannot be stopped unless killed&quot;. Hunters have the same effect with TBW and there was always counter to that with disarm. That leads me to believe its tied to bladestorm then. Now, having that in mind, there was no counter to bladestorm. Sounds like they are going to add small counter to that. Small in number of classes that can disarm - rogues, warriors, mm hunters and dont know about that shadow priests spell, if that will work, probably yes, but you will be immune to stun.<br />
I pretty much see it as survival buff against arms warriors.</div></div><hr />

Elemental shamans in full resto gear doing 11k lava burst... while healing their buddy -.-<br />

so even with that talent, bladestorm is more or less a waste of a 1,5 min cooldown. <br />

<br />
Please drop that made up fucking numbers about lava burst, learn to dispel, stun, cc, interrupt, reflect or something and even if they get a burst out it wont hit for nearly as much if you got a proper resilience set...<br />

About the warrior nurf now... the classes which don't have a huge problem with warriors are getting buffed? That's bullcrap, the only classes that should have gotten some sort of a counter to bladestorm are elemental shamans and possibly warlocks. Now don't tell me that crap about teleport, I've been charged like 1000 times at the Orgrimmar arena without even having a chance to set my port, how the hell is that fair by any chance?

Im playing arms warrior and if this &quot;Bladestorm: Warriors can now be Disarmed while under the effects of this ability.&quot; come to live its going to make warrior useles against Rogues... and tbh BS is atm only ability to win RMP's and other rogue teams in 3's...<br />
Also in 2's there is all ready to much rogue priest teams.<br />
And in 1v1 against rogue there is not much to do atm, dont wanna see what its going to be if they can disarm my lolstorm!<br />
<br />
how about spriest's huntards or other warriors that are all able to disarm?<br />
is there any team thats missing some of this classes? NOT REALY<br />

Okay.. I thought I would test Live and PTR side by side.. and I have to admit. I was not amused. My live char was doing more dmg with TC with the same gear than the PTR char. I think Blizz need to rethink this one. Why not increase the amount of dmg more and increase threat as they have done with Devestate. <br />
<br />
I took the warrior to the same instance and I did the same things.. No way have the done anything for the changes to TC. if they have.. VERY VERY VERY small changes. I hope I am wrong though.<br />
<br />
Are you saying they haven't changed it, or that it's worse now?<br />
I was thinking it'd be a buff since it could crit harder and have a lower miss chance (Spell hit cap is higher). I guess shifting it from a &quot;Spell&quot; to &quot;Ranged&quot; might mean it's being mitigated by armor now? =S</div></div><hr />

<br />
#1: Should be allowed to fuck up when the warrior is never EVER Spellreflecting ANYTHING, running around pillars without his healer and no HoT's up, bladestorming in the middle of nowhere and just tunnelvisioning my priest completely ignoring my presence. It's imbalanced if he's allowed to play like that and I can't make the tiniest mistake and have to predict his tunnel-vision behavior (not that that's particularly hard but come on...)<br />
<br />
#2: I'm not trying to get away from it as a feral. In fact I'm trying to get into it because he always uses it on my priest or rogue and if I'm in it he will take less damage because I can pop Barkskin and ruin his SS.<br />
If he pops it in the middle of nowhere or on me though... yeah i just run out of it. LoL.<br />

Charge away and fear the priest if he has put the fear ward on the rogue instead of himself.<br />

Not only do you get away from the rogue for the duration of the disarm, but you also produce insane pressure on the priest by just moving towards him.<br />

what's ghostcrawlers problem vs. warriors? Worst tanks, worst dps, worst pvp class now? Maybe i should roll DK -.-<br />

Learn to balance. Healers are op in 1on1 situations and are balanced around keeping multiple players alive. Here is the solution: Healing cast on yourself should be reduced by xx %. Healing other allys would stay the same, problem solved.</div></div><hr />

At least Hunters still have all of their abilities at their disposal when they're &quot;unstoppable except by death.&quot;<br />
Plus, distracting redpet. With abilities.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vashdakari</div><div class="date">2010-03-11, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember a WoW where even rival classes could see that a nerf was unjustified. Now people are more concerned solely with their class, and F the others to the ground for the sole benefit of their own enjoyment. It's sad really. It's even more sad that a 51 point talent can be negated every single time it's up by the same player with an inherent class skill on a much shorter cooldown, and most people don't even care. Has the community really gotten this bad?<br />
<br />
I understood the nerf to Warbringer. Hell, i play Prot, and even i knew how insanely overpowered the ability was in PvP. But how can people really be happy about nerfing an ability that most classes can easily counter, by simply getting out of the way or shielding? <br />
<br />
Some pointed to Bestial Wrath, and all i have to say about that, <br />
1.) If you're getting disarmed as a hunter, you're doing it wrong.<br />
2.) Despite your new found lack of weaponry during BW, your pet is still out there doing something.<br />
3.) Since when did BM become the primary PvP tree for the Hunter class? Arms has always been THE PvP tree for Warriors, ironic that the PvP 51 pointer will now be worthless in PvP.<br />
4.) BW isn't even the hunter 51 pointer, so it can't even be measured similarly.<br />
5.) Yes, i play a hunter, it was my second character, and my primary PvP player. Any hunter crying over blade storm is doing something seriously wrong.<br />
6.) You can still drop traps, or even deterrence.<br />
<br />
This nerf has me /facepalming alright. But more towards the WoW community than whatever Dev thinks this is a fair/fun way to treat a talent.<br />
<br />
All that said; i've been fooling with the change to Thunderclap on the PTR, and i'm pretty sure they didn't account for the difference in damage absorption through armor. They've taken a spell that ignores armor and upped the damage through crits while changing it to a physical spell. According to Critline, my TC crits have only gone up by only 100 or so. You think it'd be more with an additional 50% damage being added to the high end.</div></div><hr />

Warrior might needs some nerf in damage, but this aint the way to do it. And quite frankly Bladestorm is just a thing that you counter with cooldowns or simply by running away or just stand still outhealing it (lol)? Same thing you do with other abilities of other classes.<br />
<br />
And that one idiot who said that warriors should take the talent + weaponchain to make it zero time on disarmed. IT DOESNT STACK. MMkay?</div></div><hr />

So I automatically play RMP I guess? Or Spriest/Rogue/Sham? Who says I play with a priest? <br />

Anyways, you realize you do have to stay on a target to keep deadly poison stacks up, and you have to continue to mutilate to gain combo points to envenom. <br />

Please please please learn something about the warrior class before posting something like this. Warriors have a talent that gives us 50% less dissarm duration time which DOES NOT, let me repeat that, DOES NOT stack with weapon chain.</div></div><hr />

It does less damage than I can do with MS/OP/Ex over the same duration under the freedom. It is something like hunter's killshot and used to take down remaining ~15% of target's HP. All it's beauty is that it cannot be stoped. Now it can. Why I need it at all as a 51pt talent? Nice help for already dominating RMP's at 3vs3 and RP's at 2vs2.</div></div><hr />

Then they are in PVE gear and you have 0 resilience. Stop making up numbers you are wrong.<br />

Second off, &quot;QQ doesnt make logic! that i can be disarmed!&quot; to ANYONE saying that i would like you to do something. Now this is hard because you have to leave the basement... <br />
<br />
Go outside (i know its hard, try) get 2 baseball bats and SPIN AROUND FOR 5-10 SECONDS. Now after you get your ass off the ground from being dizzy figure out how many things you ran into. Now do it again except try and walk in a straight like towards something. This time, after you are done puking and get up off the ground, did you hit it? No? ok right. <br />
<br />
So, Logic. Don't bitch about it when your ability is not logical at all.<br />

I as a warrior, have never relied on Bladestorm to win a game for me.

While it may be disarmable, it will still get me out of a snare (it will now be my &quot;last resort&quot; snare removal), then I can make a macro to quickly cancel it off if it's disarmed, then intimidating shout or something to save my ass.<br />
<br />
Thing is, practically every class that CAN disarm will wait for a bladestorm to disarm, almost 100% ensuring I will never get disarmed unless I use bladestorm.

There's a difference between toning down an ability and making it useless against any team capable of disarming. Disarm-able Bladestorm is tantamount to outright banning the ability from Arena. Hit it and you're nearly guaranteed to be disarmed.<br />
<br />
I'm liking the look of the Thunderclap change. No Warrior ability should be influenced by silences. A little more crit damage, a little less chance to miss is welcome.<br />
<br />

We are getting a big nerf into our signature ability...<br />
So basically now a rogue will save Dismantle for when the warrior uses Bladestorm, this removes the ability completely from arena in these situations. I don't see where this is necessary... A 51 point talent becomes useless against certain classes.<br />
This ofc is a bigger nerf for 3s and 5s because there is always more probability that class that can disarm will appear than in 2s.<br />

Very good! Whining about what possibilities you lose isn't gonna help. If this goes live, Bladestorm isn't instantly 100% useless, that's only a slight exaggeration. Instead, try to find a use for the same ability while it can be disarmed.<br />
And this quoted fella did. I say three cheers for the good warrior!</div></div><hr />

51pt talent useless <br />
<br />
<br />
There are a lot of people who feel this way about their 51 point talent, soley because a good majority of them are useless in some situations, quite underpowered, or knock offs of other, much more powerful abilities. Bladestorm was one talent that was unique in that it was good.<br />
<br />
Does that make nerfing it right? Probably not. As much as it's nice to take the mickey out of some, but this just may not right at all.</div></div><hr />

Nuts. The teammates could peel the DPS off the healer. Of course, they need to be able to peel to do that, but there's a world of difference in what a healer can do when they're actively being beaten on and when they're not!</div></div><hr />

Lol.

Dunno where you find such Bladestorm.<br />
May be from those 90%++ passive arp pveheroes, when their super-duper pve trinkets are proccing? <br />
Its so hard to nerf them blabla. So we just nerf every1 as usual.<br />

Nah, i normally see DBW on hunters. Regardless of what you may try to use to justify it, it has been nerfed and it has been nerfed for a reason. (and it most likely won't get un-nerfed, i.e. stunfall and typhoon dismounting people from the moonkin pov) If there was some super-duper pve trinket for my OP pvp ability i would use it too. Sadly, neither exist. ;)</div></div><hr />

If that was the case, then this game would never ever need any balancing or tuning because everything is rock, paper scissors right? Blizzard might just have released WoW 1.0 and then taken a 5 year vacation because the game was perfect from release and the rest is just rock, paper, scissors theory.<br />

What people seem to be missing is that with this &quot;nerf&quot;, rogues and other's that can disarm will now have to save their disarm, thereby allowing warriors more time with their weapon. What is really happening here is warriors are losing their &quot;I Win&quot; button and being forced to use bladestorm more strategically.</div></div><hr />

Warrior always say &quot;your teammates should help you &quot;peel&quot; even though you can't peel someone during BS&quot;, now perhaps YOUR teammates need to help you coordinate a BS instead of charging in like 1500 rated noob and lolstorm people to death with no effort at all? <br />
<br />
How about you ask your Paladin to hammer that rogue when his trinket is on CD before you actually press your IWIN button, or have you druid cyclone/root the rogue/hunter so that he can't disarm you when you spin around like a retard or maybe have you shaman hex the rogue before using BS? <br />
<br />
The major reason for all this QQ from warriors are simply that IF this nerf actually goes live then your class just had it's skillcap raised with 100%, and everyone knows that the less faceroll your class is, the more QQ you'll provide.</div></div><hr />

Yeah and U noob the thing is that cyclone, hex, hammer of justice, repentence all have lower cd than trinket. You're not doing arena 1v1 you stupid retard, get above 1200 rating before you actually post. Or perhaps you QQ over unbalance in Battlegrounds cause you can't charge into 10 guys and watch people die?<br />
<br />
P.S bladestorm have less CD than pain suppression for Disc priests, so they should just remove BS completely then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lets put it more simply then: the 51 point talent of a talent tree has a longer cooldown than most (if not all) of the abilities that completely shut it down with this change. This means that &quot;if it's saved for BS, it will always be off CD by the time you can use BS again. It's also worth keeping in mind that 1 of those classes (rogues) is undeniably very strong in PvP purely because of how the class is designed (stealth, increased movement, stuns, etc). The other 2 classes (shadow priests and hunters) aren't that bad either.</div></div><hr />

Yes, but like I wrote in a post above, you DO have at least one teammate if not more, and you're not doing 1v1 arena and nobody cares about 1v1 duels either. A rogue can not and i promise you this disarm a warrior while he is cycloned/stunned/hexed/rooted/Chains of Iced etc, 30 yards away from your warrior. Just because you'll be able to disarm BS doesn't mean you can't use anymore,<br />

At least try to make sense when you post something and please turn off your caps lock, it doesn't make you look intimidating if that's what you think.<br />
<br />
And why so much QQ? Are you scared that you can't keep your 2.2k rating now cause you can't charge in and faceroll BS? Like every warrior said to other classes when they said BS was OP &quot;Suck it, L2P, and move on&quot;, now it's my turn so say the same.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
And warriors are bad without bladestorm? I think not. They still deal a massive amount of damage, and got their silly overpower/ms effect (against casters and healers). Plus they still have a decent amount of cc with hamstring, charge stun and pummel.<br />
<br />
It is just great that fire mages/shadow priests got some more surivability against a warrior. Warriors are already immune to fear, and the disarm effect has a 2 minute cooldown, so letting shadow priests being able to assist their partners more than they used to seems more like a balance than a nerf. <br />
I can't say much about how this will affect rogues and hunters against warriors though. But I still remember how deadly bladestorm used to be (and still are) against targets who are stunned, so alll you need is a bit more coordination.</div></div><hr />

I think alot of classes would be grateful if they had such an ability... Please read next time. I wrote decent. It's like not counting frost nova as cc when you talk about mage cc in general.<br />

Adding the fact that 'decent' is still a subjective word as far as I know. <br />
Resike, by reading your latest post in this thread, you just seem like a troll whose only reason for posting here is to tell how underpowered warriors are and how much they need a buff. There are other classes in the game too, not just the ones you seem to play with.</div></div><hr />

Well that's the same case with any melee dps no? My disarmed rogue isn't doing any imba dps either, i promise you, neither is that DK, enhancement shaman or Ret.<br />
I agree that BS in some cases isn't that OP, but can also be very OP in other cases. However i really don't think it's the end of the world for warriors with this nerf, i seriously think it just adds more coordination required for the warrior and this teammates. <br />
<br />
And hunter are still not the same as warrior, hunter damage can be pillar hugged easily, warrior damage is very substained. Ever thought of why the only double healers comp that works in WoTLK is double healer warrior?</div></div><hr />

El oh el. i have roots (which works awesomely when your standing right next to me and it makes zero difference that i cast it in the first place while i am hamstringed) oh and i have cyclone!

Wait a second, you were complaining about something? Seems like your just an ingrate who's used to being close to the top of the food chain in pvp for a bit too long. <br />

-Thorbalt<br />
<br />
And of course Warriors specifically aren't going to like this in particular because hey, go figure, it affects Warriors. And yes everyone else that has been getting it from behind because of a cheap unstoppable ability (strafe and &quot;run away&quot; work really well when your trinket is down and you are slowed/cc'd) is going to delight in this.<br />
<br />

Nope. Lowering dmg would screw pve plus in case there is no disarmer (or failed to) you still do the normal damage. Pretty much this affects pvp in some scenarios only.</div></div><hr />
