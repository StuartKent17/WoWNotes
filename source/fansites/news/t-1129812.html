Either way, MoP won't be released until Sept at the very earliest. Still means 4-5 months of changes to come.<br />
<br />
This is exactly why the bigger part of the rogue community would have rather seen a fix to the class instead of a band aid, totally subpar, useful for only a minimal time legendary which will lock us out of any future ones for the next 5 years or so. People also tend to forget that for like 2/3 rd of the last 2 expansions rogue dps sucked, mainly only due to gimmicky game+boss mechanics are we usually on top of meters.

An un-noted glyph is that monk will be able to hover in the meditative position instead of sitting down.</div></div><hr />

You've been a consistent top performer since TBC? You also had 2 legendary weapons in TBC. Grow up. You must be playing Rogue wrong.<br />
<br />
Either way, MoP won't be released until Sept at the very earliest. Still means 4-5 months of changes to come.<br />
<br />
WoW 2 x Legendary weapons that only so many ppl get. Top performers since BC? Maybe in pre BC and BC but past that no. In the beginning of wrath no matter how good your gear was you would hit a wall with your dps and dks/pally/warrior/mage in blues would be able to out dps you. Same with Cata you had to be mut in the beginning to do any dmg. With no changes to rogues or a look over it will repeat as before.</div></div><hr />

No, not T3. It's those Challenge Mode armor sets that have been datamined along with all of this other stuff.</div></div><hr />

Either way the art department is really stepping up their game, most new armor sets look fantastic and creative in comparison to cata!<br />
<br />
It does look strange that priest and monk armor are kind of plate looking, there still is a cloth element to it, maybe they are trying to make pvp gear look a bit stronger idk lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
well rogues where crap in dmg in tbc at start too, and for once a dual set wep still counts as 1 legendaries, its the set bonus not each of the weapons, no i'm glad we got got another legendarie, but i'm getting tired of ppl that see a dual wep legendaries and then says omg not fair you got 2 in one tier, shows how little you know about the rogue class, or any dual wep melee class.</div></div><hr />

Dress with metal/stone bits on? See Priest t5, t8, t13 etc etc.<br />
<br />
Enjoy your standard helping of crazy priest collar. It's becoming a trend.</div></div><hr />

What a shame that I have never participated in Arena matches, and certainly do not intend to start now. (My apologies to the artist involved.)</div></div><hr />

It makes everything look similar. I understand how cloth is hard to make imposing, but maybe it should not be made imposing. Because cloth is cloth after all.<br />
<br />
On the contrary. I think the idea to make a plate robe like T12 Paladin is a nice idea, but it looks like cloth. It has failed as well.</div></div><hr />
