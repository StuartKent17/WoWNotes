The average player is nowhere near as committed or skilled to pull that off within the next month. Hell, the average player won't even be level 60 by the end of the month. It's an impressive feat.<br />
<br />
Classic will maintain stable population at least until All Hallow's End when people start mount farming. Classic doesn't have holidays and that'll be a downer for all the casuals.</div></div><hr />

1.12 was released far after 1.3 when the original kill was made. By then all the classes had massive buffs huge QoL changes, and Rag had multiple nerfs. People remember how hard it was to kill the bosses at the time they were killed. Not over a year later almost at the very end of Vanilla. Rag only had 8 debuff slots when he was killed instead of 16 as he has in classic. Ascent had no voice chat and very few addons. The above video clearly shows multiple addons, dot timers, voice chat, all the class buffs and reworks had been done by 1.12, it's not the same thing.</div></div><hr />

Indeed. MC and BWL will be much easier because if this unless they tuned something about Boss HP etc.<br />
<br />
AQ40 should be more in par with all the changes but yeah I doubt it is much harder for these guys who have been playing years in private servers. It wasn't hard for many of us after you got them in farm..</div></div><hr />

There is no skill involved with these kills. Especially since a bunch of people on the raid team aren't even max level and are wearing greens and blues. The raids just weren't difficult at all and this proves it.</div></div><hr />

Because their fun doesn’t match other people’s fun, therefore it is wrong and is t fun and they are deluding themselves by thinking they are having fun while really playing the game wrong and hating every second of it.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps, but this does serve to highlight the huge differences between the players of the past, and the players of today: access to information. Before Classic WoW even went live, WoWHead and many other WoW fansites and fanblogs were showcasing leveling and gearing guides for Classic. Datamining, YouTube, etc. All contributed for the expedient demise of Ragnaros merely a week after the game went live.</div></div><hr />

I don’t get this statement. Most of the people downplaying this and talking shit about it are the Classic fans trying to lessen what they did.</div></div><hr />

It was not same mc what it was on vanilla release, it is kinda stupid compare classic to original. These ppl who did raid MC on release says it was hard because of the overtune.</div></div><hr />

These guys are ovviously a well oiled team. It wont be so easy for most people because shitguilds are a thing more so in 40 man guilds.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Armourboy</div><div class="date">2019-09-01, 06:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I mean no one that played back then is that surprised. Most everyone I've seen thought it would either go down the 1st week or the first day after reset. Yes there were a few deluded individuals who thought it would take a month or something but they were mostly the minority.<br />
<br />
Even in the original 1.12 MC was pretty easy. As others have pointed out though this MC was not even remotely the same situation as the original so you can't compare one to the other really.<br />
<br />
By 1.12 it had been nerfed several times, the debuff limit increased, talents had changed to make classes much more powerful. Addons weren't nearly as developed, lots of people were playing on crap PC's and connections <br />
<br />
Knowledge is another big factor as today people know every detail of a fight, where back then people were still trying to figure things out.<br />
<br />
It's a whole different world really.</div></div><hr />

Yes, it's a fact, it's been clear even back in vanilla, that most of the PVE content is trivial, it's just most players are bad as hell. It's still easy to find videos of original world/server first kills and laugh at the obvious incompetence the players display. Sometimes even in Naxx.<br />

The game isn't over, bosses drop 2 pieces of loot, they'll still spend the next 4months gearing everyone if they care to, and even then the average guild won't be doing this anything soon.<br />
These guys had a goal &quot;Kill this and this before anyone else&quot;<br />
99% of classic players just have the goal of hitting 60 and raiding in general, but these guys came to classic from a similar version of the game they've played for years while everyone else has been progressing with expansions with this specific goal so it's no surprise<br />
<br />
Good for them, they had a goal, they reached it, it's an accomplishment in it's own, but it's no surprise.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beepy</div><div class="date">2019-09-01, 08:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Watched the full stream again and having played on a bunch of private servers over the years i have to say that compared to pserver values he does seem way undertuned. The pre boss trash gets blown away like its nothing and Raggy goes down way to fast aswell that wasnt the case on pservers at least with undergeared raids. Pservers despite being on 1.12 clients had the values adjusted in order to provide a more accurate experience if blizzard used the original Vanilla values thats a mistake of them. Thats not a player skill issue considering vanilla rotations for many classes was a 1 button spam so imo MC is just way undertuned.<br />
<br />
Also its a huge mistake to compare guilds like Method with pserver guilds. Not a single pserver guild would have been able to kill the bosses Method killed last years without double or triple their wipes. Practice makes perfect and the best pserver guilds, while having very good players aswell, have cleared vanilla raids and leveled chars multiple times over the last years. Its what they do and they are pretty good at it.<br />
<br />
Despite MC being undertuned though classic wasn't hard when it came to raiding. Classic was harder then retail though on everything else. Raggy is gonna get destroyed by multiple guilds next days and on the next reset. Pretty much every guild that enters MC will clear it also on first or 2nd day.</div></div><hr />

Lets take me for example.It took me 5 days to understand it because their tittle is misleading and the Commentators did NOT made it clear.Until today i thought they are racing and actually it was them covering a Classic even.The two things are totally different.Well it may be my mistake for not understanding but i think it is more the lack of clarification from Method than anything else.<br />

By then all the classes had massive buffs huge QoL changes, and Rag had multiple nerfs. People remember how hard it was to kill the bosses at the time they were killed. Not over a year later almost at the very end of Vanilla. Rag only had 8 debuff slots when he was killed instead of 16 as he has in classic. Ascent had no voice chat and very few addons. The above video clearly shows multiple addons, dot timers, voice chat, all the class buffs and reworks had been done by 1.12, it's not the same thing.<br />
<br />
Or maybe, just maybe... Ppl sucked during vanilla. Vanilla is easy compared to todays standards and I am pretty sure they could have done this if we had the old talents system, sure a few more wipes maybe but there are also like 3 days left to farm the gear and lvl up.</div></div><hr />

That was obvious since start. Of course it's gonna be faster this time around.<br />

But APES play on private servers for years and Rag kill for them was really just about going hard on leveling and getting as much people close to 60 in the first week as possible.</div></div><hr />

Method never claimed they go for world first. They are covering the race.<br />
<br />
That's why that mage you are talking about is not even in Method, but in Progress guild, which was one of the contenders for world first Rag.<br />
They invited him and others non-method people to the event.<br />

Money support doesn't mean anything. Extensive knowledge and experience does, and that's what private servers guilds like APES or Progress have.</div></div><hr />

Yes, it's a fact, it's been clear even back in vanilla, that most of the PVE content is trivial, it's just most players are bad as hell. It's still easy to find videos of original world/server first kills and laugh at the obvious incompetence the players display. Sometimes even in Naxx.<br />

<br />
but everyone having a dig &quot;Lolol 5 days&quot; &quot;lolol first week&quot;; just to highlight<br />
<br />
They are apparently a hardcore private server guild, they've literally got years of practice in + we're talking about a full raid group of people who have had years of practice as well as being on machines which actually handle the game. Not a random arse new guild with only memories of the fight + a handful of skilled people carrying the other half. <br />
<br />
Overall, I'd say them downing raggy (And joker getting 60 so quickly) isn't a true reflection what so ever of classic. I'd be willing to wager right now I could take 40 people replying in this thread, throw them in the same gear as apes and they'd not even get half way on their first attempt and would probably take another week or two to actually down him. Time will tell though, give it another 2-6 months when the average player is 60 and gearing then we'll see the difference. <br />
<br />
On the flip side of this, I also think this gives a great insight into what we need for the future of classic. If I'm completely wrong and people are downing raggy hours after hitting 60 and this trend continues to nax then we absolutely need new content post nax to keep the player base active,</div></div><hr />

They are apparently a hardcore private server guild, they've literally got years of practice in + we're talking about a full raid group of people who have had years of practice as well as being on machines which actually handle the game.

<br />
Overall, I'd say them downing raggy (And joker getting 60 so quickly) isn't a true reflection what so ever of classic. I'd be willing to wager right now I could take 40 people replying in this thread, throw them in the same gear as apes and they'd not even get half way on their first attempt and would probably take another week or two to actually down him.

<br />
On the flip side of this, I also think this gives a great insight into what we need for the future of classic. If I'm completely wrong and people are downing raggy hours after hitting 60 and this trend continues to nax then we absolutely need new content post nax to keep the player base active,<br />

3) Even the most basic laptop can run wow at a stable FPS, 15 years ago that wasn't the case<br />
4) Previous experience from actually playing vanilla to playing private servers for years<br />
<br />
You can pick any fight you want in Vanilla (and tbh the same will be said of TBC - Wrath etc) none of them will ever take the same amount of time to down as they did back then or even be close to it. To assume it would it just pure stupidity or trolling<br />

That would be an accurate saying if the difficulties were on the same system, which they aren't. Classic raids are essentially easy to hard bosses, where are retail the bosses are tuned to normal - hc - mythic. I don't think you can make a fair assumption as a result</div></div><hr />

Lol cutting edge. I'm in a top ~500 guild in retail. Getting cutting edge is not hard even if we suck. Just because SM/Ruin happens to be the best spec for PVE dps, doesn't mean the class it self is less complicated. How hard is it to manage affliction in retail as a comparison? Just dots, moar dots and some cds/fillers in between. Really complicated stuff.</div></div><hr />

Exactly, getting cutting edge is pretty easy. But one thing I can say is rotation is not hard in retail either. You just have to be at like 100 APM and all you have to do is spam your buttons when they light up. Let me see you tank in a classic dungeon, and come back.</div></div><hr />

That's not true at all, top guilds do heroic splits and have a higher ilvl than most guilds who clear Mythic when they do it. Which is why they're able to do it to begin with. Fan boys will be fan boys</div></div><hr />

How about threat doesn't matter, mobs hits like wet noodles(Even bosses for most part), mana/resources is not an issue( for dps at least).

Look at the difference in time it took, that's the power of experience, skill and information available, things none of us had the first months of original classic.<br />
<br />
People are comparing a tool-assisted speedrun to a time where people were for the most part 'blind'.<br />
This guild has years of experience from private servers, they know exactly how to level as quickly as possible, what gear to get, and from where.<br />
<br />
It's a bit funny that the first raids are killed at all within a week but can we take a step back and remember that the average player isn't even close to level 30 yet? Ya'll are using literal speedrunners, armed with every necessary addon, 100x more game knowledge than we had back in OG classic, who has played on private servers for years, killing what is essentially nerfed bosses (we're playing 1.12 after a lot of retuning of classes etc) as an example to say that classic wasn't actually tougher for the average player? You've probably died more times leveling to 25 in Classic than you've done in BFA in any non-raid content. The murlocs in redridge are probably killing more players than anything in Nazjatar, how fitting :p</div></div><hr />

Actually, not really. All subsequent content will be even more trivial due to phasing. Any &quot;relevant&quot; guild, if they can be arsed to keep farming, will be geared to teeth from the current active phase until the next content is released. Surely they require more gear, but BWL in full T1, and AQ40 in T2 won't be a piss. I'm a bit afraid of the dear naxx as well :)<br />

True on that the AQ opening grind will be mental. However, depends vastly on the player retention rate.</div></div><hr />

Oh yeah because managing resources that will end up depleting anyway before the fight ends no matter how you do it is a lot of fun and require a lot of skill.<br />
Also who cares how hard mobs hit? And for what i recall ppl were bitching that mobs in Nazj were way oevrtuned when last patch launched.<br />

It's a bit funny that the first raids are killed at all within a week but can we take a step back and remember that the average player isn't even close to level 30 yet? Ya'll are using literal speedrunners as an example to say that classic wasn't tougher? You've probably died more times leveling to 25 in Classic than you've done in BFA in any non-raid content.<br />
<br />
Dying in classic has nothing to do with content being difficult, you can't outplay it. You're simply not going to kill something because you dont have any toolkit to do it. Or mobs that are inherently broken with 10% hp to 100% hp heals and no interrupts existing on many classes. Like yea i've died more during classic leveling than i do on retail, but its because i'm attempting mobs that are 6-7+ levels above mine, which sadly doesnt exist anymore on retail after the scaling was implemented.</div></div><hr />

The raid itself was never hard, even in its time it was just an intro raid where the hardest thing to do was finding enough people who knew basic mechanics like standing out of fire. The raids don’t get hard til some fights in AQ40 and Naxx, and even they will easily get cleared because of all the practice people get in private servers. This is why I would like to see some new raids beyond Naxx, where people need to learn the bosses by themselves and find out the best method to clear.</div></div><hr />

I've done most of the starting dungeons, RFK, SFK, RFC and so on. Yea you can clear regular mythic dungeons without a tank, but nobody does them, because they're a meme. The dungeons you see in vanilla is all you're going to get out of em, they don't have any scaling in difficulty.</div></div><hr />

To be fair, you dont need tanks in leveling dungeons on retail either. I just had a full 4 man gnomeregan run because tank left instantly and LFG couldn't find a new one until last boss. We cleared the dungeon with kiting and warrior and hunter pet tanking.<br />

Not sure where you start to need an actual tank, but would guess that at wotlk/tbc dungeons.<br />

Two different games. Classic is 2 years of class buffing and 2 years of raid nerfing combined. They might have made it so deliberately, so that the modern player has a much higher chance of going through raid tiers.<br />
<br />
Molten core at the early patches was hard. Main tank without crafted or dropped fire resist gear got 2-shot by ragnaros. Yet, since that point in time resists, damage numbers, mitigation etc. had lots of changes and classic capitalizes on all of them. People compare apples to oranges all over the place.<br />
<br />
In 2004, deadmines entrance was choke full of elite trash, that consisted in large part of overarching patrols of elite elementalist mages, accompanied by 2 elite fire elements. Level range of those was around 17. Combine that with all of those dealing fire dmg, which was basically true dmg at that point, trash density of probably pulling 2-3 packs at a time - that's what veterans call hard. Oh, those could also randomly evade as well.<br />
<br />
That was all nerfed and patched the first month of release. Half a year before the game even made it to Europe. There's none of that or other similar things in classic. Not even a hint. People just need to start treating the game for what it is, a remaster, and stop comparing Classic and Vanilla. Two absolutely different games for every little thing experienced when it had been.</div></div><hr />

Classic will maintain stable population at least until All Hallow's End when people start mount farming. Classic doesn't have holidays and that'll be a downer for all the casuals.<br />

<br />
Don't get me wrong, the dedication to reach all of this is in Classic is insane. And congratulations are in order. But let's not shit on Vanilla players like that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whether it's more &quot;casual friendly&quot; is missing the point. That is a complex argument, the truth is much simpler. It's to do with how the game presents its systems and information in a manner that constantly reminds bad players they are bad. In Classic, almost anyone can be a hero with enough time commitment. Even if they know they will likely never get there, it is a very different thing to knowing you'll never get there because you lack the skill, and then having this constantly rubbed in your face.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The way the news message is worded it's insulting towards Vanilla players, as if they're retarded for taking this long when in fact the 1.11 client is the biggest advantage which explains the 6 days. That is reason to complain because a news message shouldn't be like that, it shouldn't be a slap in the face. It's very unprofessional.<br />
<br />
It would be nice to add on a little note in the news article that the 6 days record is done on 1.12 client, which adds quite a lot of advantages compared to the 154 days record of Vanilla, which didn't have these advantages.<br />
<br />
If clients were the same between Classic and Vanilla (which isn't even possible, would require too much work and hardly anyone would even want this. 1.11 is fine, but just for the sake of argument) then I'm sure Classic players would still be faster since they have 15 years of experience.

It's not insulting, its just the truth, if you think people nowadays arent 10000 times better at the game than vanilla players, then you are delusional, cause people vastly improved at the game, that plus addons knowledge blabla.<br />

<br />
Its the experience of doing only speedruns in vanilla raids for the last years + the mechanics are just too easy. Most private servers try to overtune the raids but it doesn't matter much. One month in and all raid progress consists of who got the 1 min faster clear with 20 pppl.<br />

No. Vanilla raids are just a giant joke. Now you actually have 40 people with a brain and what to do, instead of 20 people who are semi retarded and 20 leechers trying to click spells in their spellbook or spamming rank 1 frostbolt they never bothered changing on their bars</div></div><hr />

So youre not even playing it? :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
However, here is some advice to you:<br />
<br />
<br />
The APES guild use layering exploits to generate mob respawns over and over again to AOE grind rep. This is clearly an exploit of the layering system and Blizzard needs to come down on them hard.<br />
Just like the world’s first level 60, which exploited layering bugs to generate mobs to AOE grind, this needs to be addressed by Blizzard and the exploiters banned.<br />
Both world’s first streamed these layering bug exploits so there can be no denying it.<br />
Blizzard: Save the vanilla WoW experience by a) Banning those who exploit layering bugs, and b) Fix the layering bugs! <br />

like 90% of the people in this comment section you fail to realise what guild cleared these 2 raids. <br />
Its APES, they are a hardcore guild that have been playing Classic private servers for YEARS, while we were playing retail. <br />
They have insane amount of knowledge about the game and also put that into practice over the years. They know the game inside out. <br />
<br />
Dont expect retail players, or any average guild that doesnt have nearly as much experience as these people to clear raids that quickly. <br />
Thats why it will be tough for retail players to get Scarab Lord and stuff or any other World Firsts. <br />
They just cant stand up to Classic veteran players.</div></div><hr />

I actually agree with this. I define myself as a casual player, maybe not in time played but in the difficulty of content that I do. I never do mythic dungeons, and I don't set foot in a raid unless it's LFR. But when I'm out doing world quests with my 410 ilvl and 240k health and I see other DPS with 330k+ health absolutely wrecking mobs it does suck a little bit. Now, I know Classic raiders in epics will also be wrecking mobs compared to people still in greens and blues, but I also know the content you have to do to get the gear isn't too hard for me, so I don't feel bad about it.</div></div><hr />

Yes, it's the lack of distinction between time and skill which has been muddling the waters since the inception of the game. Classic and vanilla heavily favored organization and time commitment. Those are still factors in retail, but there's a skill-based ceiling on how far they can take you.<br />
<br />
Now because raiding in retail still requires time commitment and organization, the &quot;hardcore&quot; and &quot;casual&quot; monikers have now been allowed to properly differentiate into the more nuanced reality of: How much do you play? Do you plan your time around a collective effort? Are you making an effort at optimizing you performance? What is your skill level?<br />
<br />
Most people have some kind of understanding that these things matter, but it's mixed in with the way 3rd party sites and &quot;rating&quot; addons have changed the community. So there's a strong sense among many old-timers that the game has become both more casual and more elitist at the same time. Which is really a contradiction in terms.<br />
<br />
I'm probably stepping on a few toes, but I think part of the appeal Classic has had during the pre-launch and current phase, is that promised a return to simpler days, where if you basically just needed time and bodies to have meaningful end-game progress. I think part of the group to which this appeals will be strongly turned off by the realization that there's no actual end-game progression. The application of &quot;modern&quot; organized raiding methodology just completely demolishes the content.<br />
<br />
This is just one of many different groups attracted to Classic, so I won't try to predict the consequence of exposing the unrealistic notion of a mainstream game which punishes casual players but prevents &quot;modern&quot; elitism. I think it will be part of thinning out the player base, but there's plenty of players left who are there for different reasons (nostalgia, curiosity, attraction to non-streamlined game design, etc.)<br />
<br />
But it's certainly interesting to observe the rise and fall of the hype surrounding various aspects of the game. I fully expected end-game progress to be essentially meaningless and time-gated by phases to hide this fact. The &quot;bad&quot; players may not be reminded of their failings explicitly by the game design, but they are implicitly reminded by having no carrot to chase, as the endgame has been proven trivial before they even reach it.<br />
<br />
I loved Vanilla back in the day, but I have no desire to replay it. I do however, hope it helps demolish the dated notion of &quot;hardcore&quot; vs &quot;casual&quot;. Those are remnants of a time when skill didn't really matter, and it was all about commitment and having a strong collective. <br />
<br />
MMO studios have a vested interested in keeping this illusion alive, as it helps keep retention high. That's why they are stuck in an impossible attempt to force time commitment through time-gating, obfuscate skill impact through welfare loot, having carrots for the highly organized, but making it possible to progress solo. I think this impossible balancing act is part of why many MMO communities (and WOW in particular) has become pretty toxic in their internal disagreement on casual vs hardcore, solo vs group, time-gating vs perceived forced grinding, etc. I am impressed at how long they've kept so many different player types placated, but Classic has somehow become a catalyst for these conflicts.<br />
<br />
To me, Classic is the end of WoW, regardless of success, retention period and eventual stabilized community. It could have been a cool living museum, but it's become yet another source of division and strife. Blizzard should not have allowed the hype to get this much out of control. If they'd delivered quality updates to retail, things might have resolved in a better fashion. But they've essentially abandoned retail, delivering a mockery of a storyline, letting class mechanics rot, failing completely at innovation and pumping out content as slowly as they did a decade or more ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ps. to be more precise 4days and XX hours<br />
<br />
no not true at all, it was a world wide release. it was 6 days.<br />
you obviously do not know how to math.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes for EU it released tuesday.<br />
but thats because it was tuesday for them, while it was monday for US.<br />
<br />
so yes while it was killed on saturday for US, it was killed on sunday for EU<br />
again still 5 bordering on 6 days</div></div><hr />

There was no layering in Vanilla. It seems &quot;Classic&quot; isn't really classical, huh.</div></div><hr />

Let people do what they want, let them enjoy the game even if it is this way. <br />
This will happen for other raids too. Sure, Nax will be harder. But it will happen. BUT. Why is that a problem for you?! Why? How it impacts YOU?</div></div><hr />

The values are the original ones it is not undertuned at all.<br />
<br />
Private Servers overtuned encounters else they were too easy for the regular private server raider.<br />
<br />
It is simply a case where private server players think the game is too easy and want a challenge by making it harder than it actually was.</div></div><hr />

Don't think so, if anything it will be the opposite. It tells the bad player that they too could one day have a shot of glory, even if it takes them a lot longer to get there. The bad player doesn't care that some nerds who have been practicising for this one moment for years killed a boss in a few days, they only care that it is an attainable objective for them to complete, something they could never feel about the more difficult content in retail.</div></div><hr />

Thank you for not lumping us in with that mongoloid.<br />

OT: Good for them. I'm not gonna sit here and say it's a great huge accomplishment, but it definitely shows commitment I lack myself (for any video game, much less Classic).</div></div><hr />

Lets see how long until BWL is cleared now. I expect it to be a 1 night clear as well<br />
<br />
Yeah, esspecially if you consider that when BWL comes out, they will be (more or less) fully geared. The &quot;race&quot; if you can even call that, will persist of: who entered the raid first will most likely get first nef kill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have a point that there is unreachable content for them. But there is also no glory in the available content. For the players with intrinsic motivation that's fine. But many will be unwilling to stomach the commitment needed, once they realize that noone is going to care about their Classic loot and kills. Anecdotally the glory hounds are by far the biggest chunk of players. Rewards, tangible and intangible, are key to most players. Just look at how quickly any poorly rewarding or low-prestige activity is abandoned.<br />
<br />
If anything, those players will return to retail and clamor for cutting-edge content with no skill floor. &quot;Just look at the success of classic!&quot; - &quot;We want raids anyone can complete with enough time commitment and dedication!&quot;. But that way is the land of extreme content droughts, so Blizzard can't do that. I suspect Classic will thus serve to make the community increasingly toxic in their cries for &quot;single-difficulty end-game content&quot;. Because they sure won't be asking for Mythic-difficulty as the base level of anything. But as for them actually sticking to Classic? I don't see it happening beyond a very small crowd.</div></div><hr />
