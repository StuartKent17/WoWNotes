‘Dev Watercooler’ is a blog series that provides an inside look into the thoughts and discussions happening within the World of Warcraft development team. In our first entry, Lead Systems Designer Greg &quot;Ghostctrawler&quot; Street laid down a few ground rules:<br />
<br />
1. No promises are being made in these Dev Watercooler blogs.<br />
<br />
2. Don’t read too much between the lines.<br />
<br />
3. No complaints about the topic not being what you want to see covered.<br />
<br />
The developers talk a lot about stat allocation on gear. We made some major changes to the stats that show up on armor and weapons for Cataclysm, and we periodically review how things have shaken out.<br />
<br />
One suggestion that pops up fairly often, both internally and externally, is to make gear more tailored for each and every talent spec. (It honestly feels like we have 30 classes in the game at times.) We could have bosses drop Intellect mail with Hit on it for Elemental shaman. We could go back to legitimate bear gear. There might only be one spec (or less if you’re talking Feral’s two-specs-in-one-tree deal) interested in those drops.<br />
<br />
The problem with that approach is that boss loot tables get really long. Say you’re a Resto shaman who won some mail gloves last Tuesday. Had this alternative model been in place, those gloves might not have dropped for you. In this alternate universe, the Elemental gloves did instead. There is a reason that Argaloth and his ilk feel like slot machines -- because they can drop so many items, the chance of them dropping the piece you want is pretty low. That works for the Tol Barad boss because he’s pretty easy to reach and we want to encourage players to keep coming back to him week after week so that more players benefit from his gear. It might be pretty frustrating if every boss felt like Argaloth though.<br />
<br />
There’s another extreme we talk about sometimes, which is making gear more universal. We could merge the Spell Hit and Spirit stats pretty easily for all casters the way we did for Elemental, Balance, and Shadow. There would just be Intellect cloth that everyone from Destro to Disc would want. Great, you might think, less stuff will get sharded. But then think about how it would feel if you were one of those clothies. In a 10-player raid, there might be three people rolling on your loot. In a 25-player raid, it could be double that.<br />
<br />
We could go even crazier. I mentioned in an earlier blog how Hit and Expertise aren’t very exciting to tanks, and that even if we made threat really hard to maintain, that tanks would probably still just stack survival stats and get frustrated when they lost aggro. Since we don’t vary the Stamina and Armor on tank gear (except in jewelry, socket bonuses, enchants, and gems perhaps), that means the tanking stats are really Dodge, Parry (except for druids), and Mastery. It wouldn’t be that hard to have say Haste convert to dodge chance and Crit convert to parry chance. Now the plate stats are Hit, Expertise, Crit, Haste, and Mastery (aside from the Strength and Stamina, which are always there in predictable proportions). Boom.<br />
<br />
Now plate tanks share the same gear with plate DPS. When plate drops, all the death knights, warriors, and two of the three paladin specs might want it. Is that a better world? Less stuff would get wasted but there would also be more competition. You might feel less unique as an individual, and things might feel all too similar when you go from playing your Prot paladin to your Fury warrior, but on the upside, swapping to an alternate spec might be easier because you won’t need an entire second set of gear.<br />
<br />
I mentioned two out of three paladin specs above. That third spec has been a thorn in our side for a long time. Paladins in general have a knack for that. I kid. (Mostly.) I’m talking about Intellect plate. We don’t like Intellect plate, but we haven’t come up with a good alternative for it. The pitches we hear most often have downsides we don’t like. Yes, a Holy paladin could wear mail… at which point their silhouette would look a lot like a shaman instead of a paladin. Yes, Holy paladins could derive their spell power from Strength… at which point they also hit with their weapons nearly as hard as Ret paladins. Yes, we could convert all that Strength to spell power, and convert the Hit to Spirit and the Expertise to Mastery or whatever. The Spirit to Hit conversion does the job, but it’s not super elegant or intuitive. I’m not sure we want to pile more onto that design.<br />
<br />
Unless we come up with a really compelling reason to change gear stats, we’ll probably stick with the Cataclysm model for the foreseeable future. But we’re interested in seeing your feedback. Would more universal gear be more fun or less fun? Do you like competing over items many folks want, like Deathbringer’s Will or even Cho’gall’s shoulder tokens? Does it suck when plate tanking gear drops long after the tanks have geared up, or is it nice to be able to toss it to the Ret or Fury player for their offspec? Do the druids wish they had real tanking gear? Are the Prot warriors jealous of the Feral gear model? Is this one of those places in the game that could benefit from a more simple design, even if it was a less fun design? There are no wrong answers here, only whiny ones. I kid. (Mostly.)<br />

Personally, these blogs are a waste of time. Its like, the theortical ramblings of blizzs devs who will change their mind come next expansion.<br />
I frankly have no interest in hearing the thoughts from people who think frost mages and warriors are &quot;ok&quot;, and locks are &quot;ok&quot; locks are a free kill. <br />
(yes I have a lock, as well as many other classes)<br />
<br />
The only thing I want to read is, &quot;ring of frost has been deleted&quot;, and &quot;Frost nova is on a 1 min cooldown&quot; AND &quot;ice lance damage has been nerfed to what a no cooldown instant cast should be&quot;.</div></div><hr />

i think that the idea of stat conversion would be the best fix possible. you could even loop it into the current spec &quot;bonuses&quot; ie: certain skills, different mastery effects etc)<br />
such an example could be the holy paladins. <br />
on their spec summary show: &quot;90% of strength gained from items is converted to the spellpower of the paladin.&quot; and why couldnt this be done without making them hit as hard as retadins? just do the conversion literally. instead of something like the spirit to hit conversion where you retain all of your spirit and the hit, just gain the spellpower, but LOSE the strength...<br />

i guess the way i see it is that the whole point of a video game is piling more onto basic designs. otherwise things get stagnant.</div></div><hr />

and this goes for rings, trinkets, cloaks, and necklaces as well. Boomkins, ele shaman, and spriests can roll on ALL of those while the mages and locks are solely stuck with hit and the heals can only roll spirit. Oh well though...</div></div><hr />

<br />
This has always been an idea in my head. What's the problem with changing the way seeding works? Have loot be determined when a boss is killed with a check of classes/specs in the raid. Surely something like that is possible?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thalin</div><div class="date">2011-04-05, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about making the tier tokens for all classes similar to the Heroic Al'Akir drops? We have had the same shoulder token drop from our 3 Cho'gall kills. The most recent token went unused, while there are around 8-10 guild members who would really like to get their 4th tier piece. In addition, just make gear have stat allocation points with caps for each stat and secondary stat. That way each armor piece can be customed tailored by the individual player? Seriously though, reforging is just scratching the surface. Not only would this allow customization on a more detailed level, but it would seriously reduce the amount of unused gear that often gets sharded or vendored.<br />
<br />
*edit for example* <br />
<br />
For example, mail armor piece drops, I being a hunter take said armor to reforger. The armor has a set number of stat allocation points. Let's say 40 to keep it easy. Okay pick primary stats. Okay AGI and STA looks good. Wait, maybe I should stack all of my points into AGI...Nope can't do it, there is a cap per stat to prevent stacking a particular stat to incredible numbers. Okay so I'll take 10 AGI and 10 STA. Now pick your secondary stats. I could use some more hit so I'll be taking Hit. Crit is my next highest secondary stat now that I've reached my hit cap so I'll take that too! Now my mail armor piece has 10 AGI, STA, Hit and Crit. It is the perfect piece for me! ;)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darrgen</div><div class="date">2011-04-05, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why not have some special gear similar to that of engineering helm except instead of 2 sockets only provide one. Then have the socket gems drop from bosses as well. This would make the higher end gear more universal with an open socket to most every class. the socket gems would carry item levels similar to the gear. So if you got a item lvl 372 socket you could put it in a item lvl 372 piece of gear or higher item level that had an open cogwheel socket(perhaps even have a pattern for engineering that made the actual gems and the raw material drop from bosses) Not sure what would be the problem with this approach since it adds something for engineering to do and makes gear much more flexible for classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Again, this is my honest opinion and no matter how much you druids rage about this, my opinion isn't going to change on the matter.<br />
<br />
Do you even understand what he said... they actually fixed the bear issue very well by removing the need for bears to look for STR leather gear. Bears take AGI leather gear, and usually AGI for every other slot, but can deal with using a piece or 2 of STR tanking jewelry. What he was talking about is how there are 5 specs that use leather AGI and they mostly all like different secondary stats right now... the same way there are 5 different dps plate specs that all prefer different secondary stats.<br />
<br />
He is really talking about two different issues. One they fixed rather well.. Besides holy Pallys, ever piece of gear can be shared by multiple specs, it makes the loot tables a manageable size. What he was talking about at the beginning is a completely different issue, and that is where each rogue spec ´likes´different secondary stats... so a piece that drops with haste and crit might be passed on by a sub rogue etc. The first part he was talking about if they should perfectly itemize every item slot for each spec.. the answer is no, because we already have reforging that takes care of most of that issue. they possibly could change the reforging limit from 40% to 60%. They also could go back and add more benefit for haste to a few melee specs since that is really the sore thumb stat right now.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">madyrn</div><div class="date">2011-04-05, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">tugnutt7 hit it above. There is no justification for not having a better system in place to determine what drops. The game can already see what spec each person in the group is. When you engage a boss, the current specs should be used to build a sort of temporary loot table from which the RNG pulls its drops. That way, at the least, whatever drops will be usable by someone in the group. Upgrade or not, at least it can be used.<br />
<br />
You can quibble over stats on gear all day long but, until the guys &quot;upstairs&quot; decide to essentially hard code what stats go to what spec/class, this hornet's nest will always be present. Stats are not even the half of it either. When it comes to the BiS argument, now you have situations where, for example, an enhancement shaman will go for a leather piece because it's BiS. So, this comes down to the devs not only cleaning up the loot system itself but also making a much more definite divide between who can get what and what stats are available to which spec.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Julian Rayne</div><div class="date">2011-04-05, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They can solve the Holy plate issue by introducing a new Paladin 'stance' or presence, the way Righteous Fury is the tanking presence.<br />
<br />
Divine Fury: Grants spell power equal to X% of any Strength gained from items or effects and Spirit equal to Y% of any hit rating gained from items or effects, but decreases attack power by Z%.<br />
<br />
Obviously the Spirit -&gt; hit rating conversion should be removed from Enlightened Judgements or it would lead to some interesting results.</div></div><hr />

You know, that's probably exactly the kind of suggestion and feedback Blizzard is talking about and asking for. :P</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hopezero</div><div class="date">2011-04-05, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play a feral druid and I personally love that I have to make decisions on gear based on the spec I'm playing. While a lot of time the gear would be an upgrade for one spec, it might not be for another. For example, the 4piece for tanking isn't all that great (imo) however the AP bonus for kitty is a nice boost. There is enough gear and ways to change gear to make pieces more desirable for different classes. Example: A frost DK loves crit but the Arms warrior wants more haste but they can't seem to get the haste drop for the arms warrior so he just reforges the crit to haste. (And I have no idea about these specs stating so don't rant about it ^_^). With reforging/enchants you really are able to change gear up enough to make it worth while for most people without having to really add too much to current loot tables. But the fun comes in when that one piece you really want, that fits your stating perfectly finally drops.<br />
<br />
I love that my tanking set is different from a Warriors (or any other for that matter). The differences in the game are what make it interesting. I love that H.Pallies are the only plate intel class in the game, I love that druids are the only leather tanking class in the game. These differences in gear are what make raiding interesting. <br />
<br />
I enjoy the challenge of gearing my toon, I don't enjoy gear being handed to me. I love killing halfus every week and praying that we get another Malevolence drop. Adding 3 more 2hander AGI weapons would dilute the gear instead of putting in my time and hoping i get the drop, I get handed gear. I raid for the challenge of not only getting bosses down, but also because RNG, when it comes to loot, can be fun ^_^</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Akutare</div><div class="date">2011-04-05, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly I think the best solution to spell plate is to make a new class where one of the specs is a caster who wears plate, then Holy paladins would have as much competition as elemental/resto shamans and balance/resto druids. As to what that spec in that class could be, that can be something they sort out. In a way, it's sort of a shame that they didn't make one spec of death knights like that. Maybe it wouldn't have been totally appropriate, but it would have ended the crying about spell plate. DKs do have a lot of spell effects, so it would probably not have been much of a stretch to have had one that was more caster and converted spirit to hit. Although now it's too late for that, so new class of plate wearing and spell casting.<br />
<br />
While I am making vain wishes, we also need a healer that heals people by stabbing them back to health, because that would be awesome.</div></div><hr />

With class specializations the way they are players could have a clear tag on what spec they are at any given moment. Why not just make the tables prioritize gear that can be useful. It should be doable (though the WoW machine is so old, it might be hard).<br />
Honestly the problem is, they made a game with massive gear dependance. The greatest ammount of player power comes from their gear; base stats are tiny in comparison.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Unholyground</div><div class="date">2011-04-05, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">and this goes for rings, trinkets, cloaks, and necklaces as well. Boomkins, ele shaman, and spriests can roll on ALL of those while the mages and locks are solely stuck with hit and the heals can only roll spirit. Oh well though...<br />
<br />
In my personal opinion non tier gear should scale to the class that is getting it with that armors proficiency. Similar to how druids see feral AP on weapons. A mage sees hit on on piece of cloth but a priest sees spirit. problem solved, it works for cloth gear very well.</div></div><hr />

All plate can be used by all plate wearers and all cloth by all clothies....It would mean less work skinning gear (like they ever try very hard on skinning gear anymore anyway...&quot;Give Locks a menacing looking helm, make plate shoulders ridiculous and make leather gear ugly as hell! /DONE!&quot;) and more time to make the game more suitable for the PvP divas that have, effectively, destroyed WoW.<br />
<br />
What they need to do is make reforging more effective/useful. Say I have a balance spec for my druid and I'm given a piece of gear with 127 spirit on it but no haste...Ok, I'm not lacking in the hit department so spirit won't do much aside from minimal mana regen which isn't a problem for me either. Take it over to Mr. Reforge @ the chant shop and I can turn a whole whopping like 52 of those points itemized as spirit into haste, leaving me STILL with 75 spirit that I have no use for. Why not give us the option of swapping out ALL of that nasty spirit for say...10-15 LESS of the stat that we're looking for - so that would convert to like 117-112 haste. Voila - useful stats...but at a cost - tho not too high to seem unappealing, not too low to seem ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Sounds like it would be one of those &quot;too good to be true&quot; things and Blizz would quip that it would make getting gear &quot;less fun&quot; for some people; but to that I say B.S...Gear has ultimately become a frustrating element of the game. Very few pieces seem to be well-itemized anymore, loot tables for most of the current bosses are lackluster at best and we're overall lacking in the option of a good selection of weapons, with the exception of daggers and 1h swords. (um, WTB epic caster staff that's NOT BoE)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VanishO2</div><div class="date">2011-04-05, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This has always been an idea in my head. What's the problem with changing the way seeding works? Have loot be determined when a boss is killed with a check of classes/specs in the raid. Surely something like that is possible?<br />
<br />
Unfortunately some classes could atempt to &quot;hack&quot; the system with that design, forcing a certain drop to occur.<br />
<br />
For instance, you could basically fill a BH raid with paladins, since they can fill tank, dps and healing roles. This kind of boss isn't exactly made to be killed by perfect raids or raids with diferent kind of healers, dpsers or tanks.<br />
<br />
You can even kill some bosses in the other raids besides BH with just a few classes covering all the roles in a 10man raid for example, some normal modes aren't that hard to force you go with 1 of each class or go home. I alread did at least half the bosses in T11 with a raid almost composed by Druids and Paladins. Pally Tank, Druid Tank, 2 Ret paladins, 2 Boomkins, 1 Hunter, 2 Holy Pallies, 1 Resto Shaman. You could easily swap the Resto Shaman for a resto druid, the Hunter for a feral or another Boomkin and do a good job with most bosses. And BH would basically drop only Druid and Paladin PvE and PvP gear.<br />
<br />
That could also work against you in the way that you could not count on a friend to fill your raid if he is from a class that you don't want anything to drop (basically he doesn't need anything from BH and a drop for him would be a waste again).<br />
<br />
So, in the end, the current system is the best possible, unfortunately. If only things you need, dropped, you would never have maelstrom crystals for your raid or in the market soon. The best thing possible is what we're going to have now... more sources for good gear (353 ZA/ZG) for the slots that you're having problems to join the current 346/BoE/Crafted BoE/Faction/346/359/Points. Also players sometimes dismiss good 346 gear just because they're not purple. For 4.2 we'll have all this gear + 359 valor gear from justice vendors + new stuff from Firelands (wich will probably include new crafted gear and maybe a new faction with new stuff?).</div></div><hr />

the problem stems from people thinking as a player not as a designer. &quot;i think it would be fun if all my tank gear could share with my dps gear&quot; as a player that might sound great, but as a designer that might not be the best as it could cause a lot of inexperienced tanks to try tanking for the first time and be terrible people complaining that it would be &quot;best&quot; if they had a tank enchant on one and a dps on another and they hate having to get tw ofo the same item just for different gems or enchants. and then theres the lack of enjoyment you feel when you are rolling against 8 or so other people for one fucking peice of loot,while it might drop more chances are you are going to have to watch yourself lose it a lot more too before you get it and thats just not fun. before people cryed about poorly itemized gear so blizz gave us reforge now people penny pinch stats and assume that even 60% of the previous poor stat is just too much of a fuckung burdon because cleraly every piece of gear should have bis stats every time right? <br />
im sure blizz will change the loot system some day and when they do people will just complain and say &quot;man i liked it whne loot was more random&quot; or &quot;man now that we all can use the gear we never really have enoguh shards&quot; or i guess to put it more simply heres the way the most of the playerbase thinks:<br />
<br />
MAN WOW SURE ISNT AS GOOD AS IT WAS BEFORE *current expansion here*<br />
<br />

edit:also if you think you NEED that mastery reforged to haste or w/e else to succeed then you are a fucking bad player and need to understand that you work with what you have and if you are good you succeed, if you arent then you wont, nuff said</div></div><hr />

There is no justification for not having a better system in place to determine what drops. The game can already see what spec each person in the group is. When you engage a boss, the current specs should be used to build a sort of temporary loot table from which the RNG pulls its drops. That way, at the least, whatever drops will be usable by someone in the group. Upgrade or not, at least it can be used.<br />
<br />
You can quibble over stats on gear all day long but, until the guys &quot;upstairs&quot; decide to essentially hard code what stats go to what spec/class, this hornet's nest will always be present. Stats are not even the half of it either. When it comes to the BiS argument, now you have situations where, for example, an enhancement shaman will go for a leather piece because it's BiS. So, this comes down to the devs not only cleaning up the loot system itself but also making a much more definite divide between who can get what and what stats are available to which spec.<br />
<br />
We was talking about this back in vanilla days and the Devs then said that can't work cause the bosses and all mobs in the dungeon automatically assign their loot when you first begin the Raid ID when your raid enters the place, basically they spawned the mobs in and the look was automatically picked then for that ID of that mob.<br />
<br />
I assume what you're suggesting is the mob's loot not be pre-picked, but numbers generated and loot assigned when you loot the mob or it dies? On top of that it has to check all classes (and specs?) to pick only from those lists?</div></div><hr />

Do you realize how boring and homogenized that is? That's fucking stupid.<br />
Plate DPS tiers, Paladin, DK, and Warrior, have the exact same stats essentially, and the exact same set bonuses. Same with cloth, mail, leather, etc.<br />
GOOD JOB GUIS</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Teralic</div><div class="date">2011-04-05, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Out of all stats changes, i'd consider reasonable something like this:<br />
<br />
1) Make Spirit a baseline hit in addition to out of combat regen. Just put in instead of any hit, including on agi/str gear. Why not? One could even somewhat explain it: like, more inspired warrior or rogue would actually hit things more often since they have higher morale or whatever. This won't make pretty much any differense for the rest, just one less green row and somewhat more use of rating-like &quot;primal&quot; stat. <br />
<br />
2) Give Holy a talant (or a core spec part) that would use Str as Int. But with a &quot;side effect&quot; which will decrease the amount of AP gained from Str while in holy spec by, say, 70%. They will, however, gain same offensive SP from it as from Int, so it should not change much for holy dps. They still won't need any expertise, probably, but so does hunters and they still see it sometimes on mail - not a big deal, there's always more then one option for a slot, with and without exp. <br />
<br />
3) Make hit and exp of more use for tanks (there was a nice thoughts in previous blog about extra shield procs, etc). But keep the rest same way. There's really not much needed to make it attractive for tanks - some of them already trying to cap at least non-boss hit and expertise before stacking survival. Other option would be to not make hit or exp any more useful for tanks, but give them a talant that'd let them consider bosses as 82 level target for their attacks. It might be the best way to go tbh. <br />
<br />
4) Possibly make expertise useful for hunters. Since it's on half of gear anyway. Or just remove it from mail and give enh a talant to never worry about exp. Verstion 3: since it leaves casters with 1 less useful type of stats, just bloody merge it with spirit/hit. That's some annoying stat to cap anyway, especially when you need to cap both hit and exp. Maybe give some other stat that'd be of some use for all classes.<br />
<br />
So this would basically make this types of gear:<br />
Cloth - int + spirit/mastery/crit/haste (2-3 of any)<br />
Leather - int + spirit/mastery/crit/haste<br />
Leather - agi + spirit/mastery/crit/haste/exp<br />
Mail - int + spirit/mastery/crit/haste<br />
Mail - agi + spirit/mastery/crit/haste/exp(?)<br />
Plate - str + spirit/mastery/crit/haste/exp<br />
Plate - str + spirit/mastery/dodge/parry/exp<br />
<br />
Yes, that might make gear less &quot;fun&quot; for some... But really, is it so fun at first place? &gt;.&lt; To have this mess with stats that can't be used by half potential users just because of a single rating on it? If you're worried everyone will roll on the same gear - no, they won't. You can see it even now: when crit cloth drops, fire mages would drool on it, when some priests or who else won't even consider it as upgrade over some haste lower ilvl gear. Those ratings unlikely to be equal for every spec, and as far as i remember, it is supposed to be some rating of more use then others. But there should not be a trash rating that noone ever wants to use (when you see a matching prime stat &amp; type on the item). <br />
<br />
You can have some classes/specs centerd around one rating and make it &quot;the stat you would reforge to&quot; even more clear then it is for some specs today. Just the rest 3-4 ratings should be around -20-30% less useful, not -80% or of no use at all, that's all i mean. <br />
<br />
That's how i see it. Everything is totally IMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now:<br />
Spirit cloth drops - 3 priest specs roll on it<br />
Hit cloth drops - mages, warlocks, and spriests roll<br />
Non-hit/spirit cloth drops - all clothies roll<br />
<br />
After:<br />
Spirit/hit cloth drops - everyone rolls<br />
Non-hit/spirit cloth drops - everyone rolls<br />
<br />
The only changes are healers would have more competition, but then the frequency that available pieces showed up would increase. It would take some more maths to prove that it is a better situation for clothies. As for off-pieces, it would be Wrath-rolling all over again where everyone rolled on everything.<br />
<br />
<br />
As per the suggestion to convert str -&gt; SP/int for holy paladins, that goes against Blizzard's &quot;this is good but looks bad&quot; policy. They really try to avoid associating good things with bad things. Could it work? Yes. But it isn't a direction they want to go. As for having a &quot;Righteous fury-style stance&quot;, it would have to be a Holy-only stance or else Ret and Prot healing would be way too good. At that point, you might as well just make it a passive. And even then, what's to stop a holy paladin from toggling it on and off when they need to heal and then facerolling DPS all the other time? If you were to convert strength to int or SP, it would have to be all the time.<br />
<br />
I think the biggest thing Blizzard is overlooking with paladins is that (unless I'm mistaken) Strength based Holy Paladins using melee attacks would do less damage than the current Intellect based Holy Paladins spamming exorcism. And what does it matter if their melee attacks hit &quot;nearly&quot; as hard as Ret? They have an amazing arsenal of melee attacks consisting of Crusader Strike and auto-attack. Judgment isn't even a melee attack. Woo! If that really is their main concern, it is a really weak one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But Paladins are by far in the worst shape for gearing up various specs or content.<br />
<br />
DPS (and leveling to an extent)? Strength/Haste/Crit gear.<br />
Tanking? Completely different set.<br />
Healing? Yet another set.<br />
PvPing? Well there's holy and ret versions for that too!<br />
<br />
We're the only class that really needs up to 5 completely separate sets of gear. Others can reforge things like spirit/hit and have a fairly functional (although not optimal) set of gear. But a Paladin that likes to do all three specs? Have fun spending obscene amounts of Valor/Justice points trying to fill all those rolls.<br />
<br />
It really needs to be addressed. Converting ret stats to holy makes most sense since things like crit and haste are usable by both (convert strength -&gt; Int, Hit/Expertise -&gt; Spirit), and it could easily be done through the talent specialization feature.<br />
<br />
In doing so, you'd go from 5 sets of gear for pallies down to 3. Tanking, PvE heal/dps, and PvP heal/dps.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think this needs to be done across the board where cloth drops and suddenly all cloth players want it, but my god it makes sense to get rid of Int plate.</div></div><hr />

Ghostcrawler's withdrawal from the official forums was a very well-calculated move on Blizzard's part. The playerbase wondered where he was for months until someone finally came out and said where he'd gone. By the time he came back, people are willing to listen to anything he said because he'd effectively removed himself--the go-to source for insight to the development team--for so long. It solidly put him in charge of the conversation as opposed to Wrath-era's reactive forum responses.<br />

I enjoy these blogs (not immensely, but worth a read...so far), even if these are things that hardcore theorycrafters talk about all the time. The majority of the playerbase doesn't get into theorycrafting, and so these blogs give him a chance to talk to the playerbase about things that the majority of them aren't aware that Blizzard thinks about. Would you honestly rather he go back to stealth mode and not have any chance (again) to look into what they're concerns are? The Blue Tracker these days is mostly snappy comebacks to people's off-topic remarks, thread-lock notices, code of conduct warnings, etc. The only time anything interesting gets said is when one of them takes something a player posted to Ghostcrawler and brings his response back to the forums.</div></div><hr />

You linked trinkets?? lol There have been plenty of cool proc trinkets throughout the years in WoW. Please show me an RPG game that didn't upgrade gear with more stats? Of course stats are boring, but its freaking armor.... you wear it.<br />
<br />
You want procs on ALL your slots!? Sounds to me like you are playing the wrong type of game. Go play Chromehounds, Armored Core or some other customizable mech game, if you want every piece of equipment to do something unique.<br />

i think that the idea of stat conversion would be the best fix possible. you could even loop it into the current spec &quot;bonuses&quot; ie: certain skills, different mastery effects etc)<br />
such an example could be the holy paladins. <br />
on their spec summary show: &quot;90% of strength gained from items is converted to the spellpower of the paladin.&quot; and why couldnt this be done without making them hit as hard as retadins? just do the conversion literally. instead of something like the spirit to hit conversion where you retain all of your spirit and the hit, just gain the spellpower, but LOSE the strength...<br />
<br />
i guess the way i see it is that the whole point of a video game is piling more onto basic designs. otherwise things get stagnant.<br />
<br />
I like this idea. Basically, the stats on the gear could change based on your spec. Then a paladin or a druid doesn't need 3 sets of gear, just one because the stats change according to spec. It also solves problems with mail, leather, and cloth. Cloth gear for healing specs have spirit on it, but change specs and it could go to another stat. <br />
<br />
In a way, the game already let's you do this for 1 stat via reforging. It could be expanded to incorporate all stats based on spec, and automatically be done for you when you change your talents.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We're the only class that really needs up to 5 completely separate sets of gear.<br />
<br />
This is typical with all classes and no one can kinda use gear from a different spec.. I was using Ret gear for PVP for a long time and even the forging had to be redone if I wanted to PVE in that gear.. Also Haste doesn't play out for you very well in Ret so I have some suspicion you don't even research what is best anyway.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RokFenris</div><div class="date">2011-04-05, 08:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I was designing the system from the start, I would have:<br />
<br />
- Bound each character class to one armor class (cloth, leather, mail, plate), making it impossible to use gear from the wrong armor class; I don't see any advantage for allowing players to use non-optimal armor anyway.<br />
<br />
- Made gear with meta-stats (perhaps offense, defense, recovery), and added talents to each spec to convert said meta-stats to their usable stats. This would enable gear sharing without the nasty side-effect of giving strength to spellcasters, for example. Thus, there would be just 4 kinds of gear, each usable by 2 or 3 classes.<br />
<br />
- Added for each armor class and slot, on each gear tier, a few different options, both in stats and appearance. Thanks to the common gear, each player should have way more choice in stats and appearance even if the devs created less items than they currently do.<br />
<br />
- Enable bartering of soulbound gear pieces, as long as both pieces had the same armor class, slot, and iLvl. Enchants and gems would be wiped from both pieces (or, perhaps, just exclusive enchants and gems would be wiped, while those that anyone can use could remain).<br />
<br />
As for my preference, basically as little randomness in gear acquisition as possible. When I was still playing WoW I kept dreaming of gear for all slots being sold for points, including weapons. I hate with a passion any gearing system where pure luck decides when I'm done gearing (as happens with WoW; sometimes you can kill 20 times a boss with 25% chance of dropping the piece of gear you need without seeing it drop once).<br />
<br />
BTW, there would be other ways to reduce the amount of wasted gear even without increasing gear sharing: Individualized loot (for example, by giving each player a rewards bag with the gold, marks, and a chance for gear, instead of a common drop to be rolled for); drops adjusted for group composition (don't drop gear only useable by classes not present); more point-bought gear (including gear for most/all slots) and less dropped gear; etc.<br />
<br />
The system I would really prefer for gear acquisition is GW2's proposed one; per-player loot (other players can't even see what each other got), and the instance conclusion loot being tokens that the player can exchange for the piece of gear he wants. Little to no waste, absolutely no gear drama; seems like a very good way to make players more willing to group up for me. Couple that with DCUO's loot locks (as opposed to WoW's raid or boss locks) in order to allow players to do the raids as much as they want while getting the rewards just once per week (and to let them try again with a different group if the first one fails, thus avoiding lost weekly loot due to poor choice of companions), and you might have a much healthier raiding scene.</div></div><hr />

<br />
paladins are still the worst though, druids for example can use 2 pve sets with slightly different gems/enchants (agi set and caster set), shamans have the same, all pure dps classes only need 1 pve set. paladins still need 3 different pve sets, no ret item is viable for holy or prot and vice versa. <br />
about pvp though, there are more classes that have 2 sets. so that's not really a problem.<br />
imo blizz should make plate dps gear viable for holy paladins or something, maybe turn some things around and make it a melee based healing spec.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Divine Fury: Grants spell power equal to X% of any Strength gained from items or effects and Spirit equal to Y% of any hit rating gained from items or effects, but decreases attack power by Z%.<br />
<br />
Obviously the Spirit -&gt; hit rating conversion should be removed from Enlightened Judgements or it would lead to some interesting results.<br />
<br />
This is a bad idea, one which GC mentions &quot;Yes, Holy paladins could derive their spell power from Strength… at which point they also hit with their weapons nearly as hard as Ret paladins.&quot; <br />
<br />
It's impossible to not see a righteous fury like presence being abused, being able to heal, switch to dps, switch back to healing all during the same encounter. In PvP i'm sure it would be even worse.<br />

We're the only class that really needs up to 5 completely separate sets of gear. Others can reforge things like spirit/hit and have a fairly functional (although not optimal) set of gear. But a Paladin that likes to do all three specs? Have fun spending obscene amounts of Valor/Justice points trying to fill all those rolls.<br />
<br />
It really needs to be addressed. Converting ret stats to holy makes most sense since things like crit and haste are usable by both (convert strength -&gt; Int, Hit/Expertise -&gt; Spirit), and it could easily be done through the talent specialization feature.<br />
<br />
In doing so, you'd go from 5 sets of gear for pallies down to 3. Tanking, PvE heal/dps, and PvP heal/dps.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think this needs to be done across the board where cloth drops and suddenly all cloth players want it, but my god it makes sense to get rid of Int plate.<br />
<br />
Even thought it seems like a pain to collect all these gear sets, when I was holy (went prot. for cata) I woulda felt pretty lame rolling on ret. gear. I mean seriously, in every scenario similar to this it leaves holy paladins as like the bastard step-children who don't deserve their own set of gear. Let's face it, Int. makes sense for a holy paladin. Str. doesn't, and some lame aura/presence/talent to covert str. to int. or spell power just seems pathetic. I would rather they kill off the spec first.</div></div><hr />

How about a badge system for these bosses in stead.

<br />
•341 Agi<br />
•512 Stam<br />
<br />
Now what if, every time this staff dropped, the actual stats varied, let's say by -10 / +20 Agi, and -25 / +25 stam. <br />
<br />
One might drop, for example, with +5 agi / -20 stam, so would look like:<br />
<br />
•346 Agi<br />
•492 Stam<br />
<br />
What I'm suggesting isn't exactly game breaking here, but there would be something cool about having &quot;perfect&quot; or &quot;rock-bottom&quot; or &quot;average&quot; stats on a given piece of gear, rather than the same formula. <br />
<br />
This might also motivate people to keep running dungeons and raids, even if the upgrades for them there would be rather small.<br />

<br />
I assume what you're suggesting is the mob's loot not be pre-picked, but numbers generated and loot assigned when you loot the mob or it dies? On top of that it has to check all classes (and specs?) to pick only from those lists?<br />
<br />
Well, it can work. When those loot tables are automatically assigned checks can be made to determine, at the very least, what classes are in the raid. At best there could be a spec check but seeing as the excuse keeps getting tossed around that blizz never intended any specific stat for any particular class that would be much more code intensive. The simple class check would work and only add a slight addition to the dungeon load time. A sacrifice of a few seconds is well worth a smoother, more usable drop experience in a raid or dungeon.</div></div><hr />

I thought it was amazing when we had spell power gear and healing power gear even though it made it harder for a healer to farm whatever he or she wanted to, but that was just a part of being a healer! (Played Resto shaman at the time so im not just a retarded dps complaining).<br />
<br />
I think the situation is even worse as a tank. I only got insight in the prot paladin atm, but stats as hit and expertise is almost useless as its not even hard to keep aggro. All you have to do is stack mastery and swap stamina when you reach the avoidance cap. wtb TBC times where you as prot warrior had to get expertise to minimize the parry mechanism and ofc imcrease your threat + you had to get hi t to maintain your threat. From what I've seen/tried to so far in cata you can easily swap to prot as pala even though you still got 4-5 holy pieces and be ahead on threat by miles. <br />
<br />
The main problem with merging gear and stats is the more you do it the less theorycrafting, I thought the arp was great in the beginning, however because it ended up scaling so well in the end it ruined it, mainly just because of warriors in pvp. (GG). But insted of removing the stat they could have changed the percentage of arp you gained from xxx amount of points to even it out.<br />
<br />
So imo: Blizzard is going in the wrong direction, give us some more stats to play around with, make some of the minor stats more important to max out as tank, hit / expertise cap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sounds like it would be one of those &quot;too good to be true&quot; things and Blizz would quip that it would make getting gear &quot;less fun&quot; for some people; but to that I say B.S...Gear has ultimately become a frustrating element of the game. Very few pieces seem to be well-itemized anymore, loot tables for most of the current bosses are lackluster at best and we're overall lacking in the option of a good selection of weapons, with the exception of daggers and 1h swords. (um, WTB epic caster staff that's NOT BoE)<br />
<br />
Just because you want every piece to have perfect stats for you (lazy syndrome), doesn't mean all do. There needs to be some kind of choice in the game, or it becomes stale.</div></div><hr />

The current team working on WoW is the laziest I've ever seen. They constantly re-use items, raids are now 2 rooms long. They talk for 6 months about a change, and then wait another year before implementing it. This game should be having monthly patches with all the things that need to be done, but they realized a long time ago, they can just sit and do nothing and make the same money and any time they want more, they spend 2 days and throw up another item on the Blizzard Store. There is no incentive for them to improve the game because they are a monopoly, and the #1 rule for a monopoly is to extract more money and do less work because there is no alternative for an addicted fanbase to turn to.</div></div><hr />

Speaking from a logical view how can mail even propose to have the same ammount of protection that plate can provide, the dodge spectrum has already been filled by bears.<br />
<br />
Only reason it wasn't viable was because blizz continued to make them non-viable. They take away the increased shield block, they made it so that if you wanted to parry you had reduced threat, took away the increased armor and the increased stamina. Blizz hated shamans to the point that they got rid of an entire part of them. They could have done it differently, but they didn't.<br />
<br />
Now your point about &quot;how can mail even propose to have the same ammount of protection that plate can provide&quot;... are you serious? You are wearing leather! Same thing would go with a shaman that druids get. Give them something like righteous fury or some stance like Bears, DK's, and Warriors have that gives them reduced damage, increased armor, and increased threat. We have a taunt now even! The dodge aspect of bears only fixed that they can't block or parry... nothing to do with the armor itself.<br />
<br />
As for the rest of this topic, homogenizing the gear is just silly,no holy pally wants to really wear str on their gear. If they did this to plate, then they would in turn do this to mail and leather as well making ele/resto shaman, and resto/balance druid wanting agi since hunters/rogues sure aren't going to be wearing intellect and spirit.</div></div><hr />

I do not believe a more universal gear would be better or more enjoyable implementation. With the current lack of customizability we would see players more than ever looking like clones of one another. Much like the simplifying of classes and the removal of class/spec uniqueness, in order to make 10 man raiding with various compositions understandably valid, we would see a continued deterioration of 'uniqueness'. Gear competition is not enjoyable any more than bosses with enormous loot tables. <br />
<br />
The resolution for these competing dilemmas does not reside within the gear itself, it is in the distribution of it. Therein lies the fundamental problem that needs to be addressed.<br />
<br />
It is NOT the gear statistics OR the loot tables, it is HOW THEY ARE ACCESSED.<br />
<br />
Right now the Cataclysm loot system favors numbers of participants over strong play, which goes against the encounter design of the expansion. Which is what? To challenge players to play better by providing substantially more difficult encounter content than the previous expansion, but the loot system does not reflect this. It needs to. The system for determining loot right now has not effectively changed in the last 6-7 years of this games life. Everything else has changed, but not how loot is accessed from bosses by players.<br />
<br />
Why not? Why has this aspect of the game not evolved with the rest of the game? It clearly needs to be.<br />
<br />
If the development team's intention is to challenge players to increased levels of game play, then the system for determining loot should coincide with this gesture in development. Strong play should be rewarded if that is what you want to encourage. Think outside the bubble your team's development brain seems to be perpetually locked in. A new loot system that rewarded increasing levels of play with increasing loot OPTIONS would make the matter of large loot tables insignificant if done appropriately.<br />
<br />
Advance the loot system technology so that it encourages stronger play. I don't mean current hard modes or Ulduar ones. I mean give a boss 2 achievements of increasing difficulty, and for each one they successfully fulfill when completing the encounter, one of the random drops isn't so random anymore. Don't be shortsighted with what I said. THINK BIGGER. Expand upon the root concept, the idea, not these shortsighted examples I just gave.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">randysavage</div><div class="date">2011-04-06, 09:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I assume what you're suggesting is the mob's loot not be pre-picked, but numbers generated and loot assigned when you loot the mob or it dies? On top of that it has to check all classes (and specs?) to pick only from those lists?<br />
<br />
generally speaking this is how i believe it should be (discarding the spec component)...randomly selecting loot for small raids in which some classes will undoubtedly not be represented is a flawed system...in a 40-man raid world, maybe not so much, just because of raid size and the greater chance somebody, anybody, can soak up the loot...but for 10 mans, most certainly...we've all probably been on countless runs where conversations along the lines of, &quot;oh well, i wish we had a shammy to take this loot&quot; happen...<br />
<br />
this doesn't have to happen when a mob dies, necessarily...it could be set when the instance was initiated (like it is now) but with a prospective look at raid composition...the caveat being that initial raid composition could be leveraged to force loot for certain classes to drop, and once the instance was opened, the composition changed...(that, of course, would take the willing participation of several people who agree to not have any chance at loot dropping for them at all during the raid, which may be hard to find)...the other way to do it would be to set the loot table based on the raid composition at the time of the pull...no boss fights are so short that this would be a computational challenge...it might be a programmatic one, though...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spasmodic</div><div class="date">2011-04-07, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is actually a pretty simple problem to fix. <br />
If a piece of loot drops off a boss, theres two options<br />
<br />
if someone directly needs it. they roll need and can recieve the item.<br />
<br />
if nobody needs it the item can be disenchanted to a crystal or sold to a vendor.<br />
<br />
All that needs to be added is something along the lines of a third option.<br />
<br />
Instead of being vendor'd/Disenchanted. a player can bring the piece of gear to the Valor Point vendor, and trade it with another piece of gear off that boss for a simple 1000 Valor points. and then just make a notification when looting if the player recieving the item doesnt have 1000 valor points available.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
it seems like a clean-cut method. you still need to raid to get gear, and no healing paladin will take a Plate DPS gear over a warrior/DK</div></div><hr />
