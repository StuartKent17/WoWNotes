Surprisingly, the loot ilvl isntt higher than the one on the other bosses (ilvl 226 on Armor and ilvl 232 on Weapons). It looks like Blizzard wants players to run hard-modes for the higher tier of gear and not just complete the instance in easy mode. <br />

Instances nowadays are balanced around the fact that every normal guild should be able to down all bosses, not just the top 5% guilds.<br />
<br />
This is why there are hard modes for the top 5% guilds so they can do those and gain extra loot and with ulduar, even an extra boss.<br />
<br />
Ulduar normal mode was never meant to be super hard, so naturally top end guilds were bound to clear it fast.<br />

<br />
30 weeks of raiding? that's over 6 months for a mace, provided you never miss a 25 man yogg kill. It will be unrealistic to expect this mace from only killing yogg, the other hard modes will be needed.<br />

<br />
sweet, they get 5 days to sleep after being up all night and raiding on the PTR for the past 2 months. When raiding is your job and your hobby, you no longer have a real life.</div></div><hr />

it took the best players in the world about 9 hours to down him, with 5-10 people waiting outside for replacements<br />

The play 2-3 days for making the first kills. And when the race is over, they play normal times within few weeks til all gets full Epics from Ulduar and clearing the heroic hard mode, then they take a long brake from wow til a new content is released and in the meanwhile, you are playing everyday for the next 6 month and trying to complete the full tier 8 set with other random epics in Ulduar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is why there are hard modes for the top 5% guilds so they can do those and gain extra loot and with ulduar, even an extra boss.<br />
<br />
Ulduar normal mode was never meant to be super hard, so naturally top end guilds were bound to clear it fast.<br />

Translation: Blizzard hits two birds with one stone! They can go after dumbarse players/guilds (I say dumbarse because some of the best guilds only raid for limited hours, while their skills pull them through) while at the same time lack on content by making the actualy encounters easy!</div></div><hr />

I kinda laugh at this. Back in the past (vanilla wow) the instance wasnt cleared in just 1 day.<br />
<br />
Anyone remember the old 4 horsemen?<br />
<br />
<br />
sad QQ...4 horsemen was the endboss of last instance in content...and Yogg is the somewhere close to Hakkar or Ragnaros...who was pretty easy with a skilled group..3.2 will Be Nefarian/C'Thun/MH patch so we will see..and it was easy mode that took them so long..<br />

03:30AM CET till 14:00 PM CET..oh yeah i bet every guild in the world can stay online for 1 boss wiping for 11 hours...<br />

So what if they get paid? All the top guilds were racing to get World First no matter if they were paid or not, they did it for the sense of achievement. Money doesn't make you a better player, all the top guilds already had full team in T7.5 with best possible equipment. Face it, Ensidia is the best WoW guild in the world, especially impressive given their server was crashing and US got 1 day head start.<br />
<br />
As for getting paid - wouldn't you want to be paid to do something you love/play video games? Not many ppl can say that about their work. Why are you complaining about Ensidia being sponsored ad not about legions of Korean players playing Starcraft and W3 on tournaments?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not the point here at all. The point here is Yogg-saron is the last boss yes, but not technically the hardest boss in Ulduar. I am waiting on the World First kill of Algalon, I could care less about some guild killing Yogg-saron and I'm sure others feel the same.</div></div><hr />

Backers in Dubai is what I heard. I actually feel sorry for Ensidia at these times. The pressure to world first this patch must be extreme. Their livelihood depends on this performance.

I find it amazing since yesterday, as EU servers were just going online, american servers already only had Vezax and Yogg left. That's been quite a race for Ensidia, not even 24h.<br />
<br />

You've got to be kidding me, right? 24 hours? How long was the PTR up where they could learn all the other bosses in the raid? 2 months? It took them 24-ish hours to learn and down 1 boss.</div></div><hr />

don't forget theres not even 'first!' achievement this time around for normal.<br />
i would be seriously surprised if it took more to kill yog on normal, there are like 4 hard modes to it and world first is only for algalon and alone in the darkness yogg.<br />

look at list of hardmodes, it's nearly empty only first boss is done and thorim.<br />

Yeah, you're totally right dude. Now if you could just post &lt;The Gallery&gt;'s killshot of YS we can all pat you on the back for beating this casual content.<br />
<br />
Thank God all Elite players aren't 'tards like you- I quote Mek from Ensidia &quot;I think Ulduar is very well thought out. It has something for all types of raiders and I really do think that's a good thing. We want hard content and others just want to be able to see everything the game has to offer for their ?10 a month.&quot;<br />
<br />
If the best players in the world are cool with less pro gamers seeing the same content (as long as there are other Hard Mode challenges in there for them), what's your problem? They did YS easymode- if they still think he's piss without any Watchers helping THEN there's a problem.</div></div><hr />

With 40 people needed in a raid, the chances was much greater that you had a handful of people that would cause your progress to slow down then with 25man.<br />
<br />
Also, MC, BWL, etc. wasn't really any harder then the WotLK bosses. The good and decent people have over the 3 years gotten better at their game makes things easier.<br />
And don't tell me &quot;BWL was so nice, it took ages to clear.&quot;. No shit Sherlock, maybe cause of a little cockblocker called Onyxia Scale Cloak that you needed AT LEAST 40 of, prefereably more for replacements. It had nothing to do with if the boss was hard or not.<br />

Slowing down progress with doors (Sunwell) or worse hard to get resistance gear (BWL) isn't really a good solution.

It's funny trying to make something hc and hard when it's not actually. The depth and the complexity wow lacks in comparison to some other successful mmo it tries to replenish it with an extremely painful system. <br />
At first they tried to create a hc mmo setting ridiculous obstacles like endless grinding, broken mechanics and specific talents. <br />

And whoop whoop world first. I'll default to the argument that who really cares who kills what first. In the end, you'll have nothing to show for it.<br />

Back in those olden dark days of raidign , how to effectively raid were not well know concepts, people had little practice and also alot of class abilites and talents just didnt make sense.There was very little synergy like there is today too.<br />
<br />
It is true that blizz has also streamlined alot to do with raiding but not to make it easier , much more to make it doable and more fun, e.g changing the way loot drops and doing away with attunements.Not to mention more people are raiding now more than ever!!.Blizz also did a bad job on pvp during the first season of wotlk so even more incentive to raid.</div></div><hr />

As soon as you can link your armory with your achievement of Algalon and Yogg'Saron kills, I'll listen to what you have to say.<br />
<br />
Of course ensidia were going to clear it within a day. Everyone is fully geared with best in slot, they've played on the PTR, and more importantly they've been playing this game for years. It makes a difference with knowing your class.<br />
<br />
My guild is a better than average guild on our server. We one shotted FL, and spent four hours wiping on X-002. That being said, we didn't have DMB, haven't seen the fight before and didn't know any tactics. <br />
<br />
It's fun, and definitely a challenge. I reckon it'll keep us going for a while. And then we have hard modes :D</div></div><hr />

I'm sure they feel the same way counting that mountain of money they get every month from 10 mln+ subscribers. <br />
<br />
WoW in 2004 was untested quality, I'm sure Blizzard didn't know how popular it would be (and I'm sure 1-2mln was in their wildest dreams), so they decided to appeal to hardcore fans first. But hey, you got John and Bob here that want to play it as well! That is surprising! But they cannot raid so much, so let's make some extra content for them. Ok, now this is done, hey - maybe we should make raiding a bit easier? Like normal and hard modes??? We got those 10mln people playing out of which most is casual maybe we SHOULDN'T SCREW THEM OVER FOR A BUNCH OF NO-LIFE NERDS???<br />

<br />
Top guilds cleared it in 1 day,wasn't it a simmilar story with sunwell?<br />
<br />
Sure ulduar is no sunwell,but it beats naxx by a long shot.<br />
<br />
I'm a casual player on a very slow server and in a good guild,i play about 10-12 hours a week which is mostly 3 raids.<br />
<br />
We cleared eveything in tbc up to brutallus,and it was great.<br />
<br />
We cleared naxx 25 in 1 month after release of wotlk ,sarth25 in 3 weeks in wotlk and malygos 3 days after naxx,ok that was pointlesly easy.<br />
<br />
We did a 10 man ulduar last night,we all knew the tactics for first 4 bosses.<br />
<br />
Resaults?Ff we dont count instance crashing 7 times,2. try leviathan down,4.th try razorscale down,we would probably down 1-2 more boss if it wasnt for lag but nvm that.<br />
<br />
We all have BIS t7.5 gear,was it easy?yes,but it wouldnt be if we had 10 man gear<br />
Was it fun?hell yes<br />
Step up from naxx?definetely.<br />
It's not hard as t5 was in tbc,but yea,you need to think and figure out tactics to make it work,unlike naxx.<br />
<br />
The people clearing it atm are top skilled and dedicated players,who actually sacrifice their free time and put some efort into going for first kills.<br />
<br />
Dont make assumptions about a raid based on world's top 3000 people,you are probably not among them.<br />
<br />
It's not farm raid with undergeared people like naxx was,go in there,have some fun,and think of what your guild can do not world's top guilds and players.<br />

Happy hunting all!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ulduar was not fully cleared. Algalon still has to be killed. I'm not big into achievements either, but these &quot;hard modes&quot; are geared towards the top end guilds and are actually required just to reach Algalon. I think the following weeks will be just as big of a race as this week between the top guilds to reach and down Algalon. Even being from the states, I think what Ensidia did was amazing considering the US guild Exodus reached Yogg 12 hours before Ensidia. Grats to them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're absolutely right, that's why Envidia's killshot post finishes with &quot;Until next week, when we will go for Hardmodes and hopefully Algalon!&quot;- obviously they don't care about hard modes and see Ulduar as cleared with nothing further to challenge them in the instance. Obviously they see hard modes as just something else to do, not as something to prove their skills against the ultimate in challenging content.<br />
<br />
And of course Mek saying on his blog &quot;I think Ulduar is very well thought out. It has something for all types of raiders and I really do think that's a good thing. We want hard content and others just want to be able to see everything the game has to offer for their ?10 a month.&quot; also indicates that top guilds really hate the implementation of Hard Modes. You clearly speak for all elite raiders in your rejection of them.<br />
<br />
Either that or you're just whining into the wind while the really hardcore raiders understand why Blizzard have done what they have, and are more concerned that there is still something to challenge them than they are about excluding less hardcore players from the content.</div></div><hr />

Unless &quot;instance not found&quot; errors, is part of some hidden attunement process. This is exactly why I don't like world first recognitions, it creates some illusion of grandeur. If an entire battlegroup of servers can't get into the new content before someone else clears it, that doesn't really constitute a &quot;world first&quot;, simply because the content wasn't available for the world. The day Blizzard starts getting their ducks in a row and can manage to roll out new content to everyone at once then world firsts and similar accomplishments will mean something. For 4 days our guild has been trying to zone into Ulduar. As a matter of fact people have been hard pressed to get into ANY instance.

<br />
<br />
Gratz on the kill, beat content &quot;making&quot; the strategy is always very impressive. For the rest of us lets just copy their strategy and farm it when possible. For those who ll flame me i know all of you guys do bosses without any type of pre-info or strategy so u can call it uber-easy.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
People keep saying things took longer back in the days. And I'll tell you why right now. It involves the number 40. With 40 people needed in a raid, the chances was much greater that you had a handful of people that would cause your progress to slow down then with 25man.<br />
<br />
Also, MC, BWL, etc. wasn't really any harder then the WotLK bosses. The good and decent people have over the 3 years gotten better at their game makes things easier.<br />
And don't tell me &quot;BWL was so nice, it took ages to clear.&quot;. No shit Sherlock, maybe cause of a little cockblocker called Onyxia Scale Cloak that you needed AT LEAST 40 of, prefereably more for replacements. It had nothing to do with if the boss was hard or not.<br />
<br />
Slowing down progress with doors (Sunwell) or worse hard to get resistance gear (BWL) isn't really a good solution. Nor is it a good solution to tune every encounter in the game after Ensidia's level of skill and determination. Cause if they did, I'll promise you, you would never see the second half of Ulduar.<br />
<br />
Like people say, congratulation with plowing through it in normal mode. Now get cracking on the hard modes and Algalon the Observer which are the feats that really matter. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Really well spoken! Just to add a fact to your post i need to say u forgot to mention the resistence gear farm need to tank Baron Geddon was a time sink as well and all the gearing up needed from MC pieces to progress in BWL, since it was the only place where u could get gear to actualy progress (professions where a waste of time back them).</div></div><hr />

It may just be a language barrier but sponsoring someone is the same as paying them. End of story. Payment isn't always money. Payment takes many forms. <br />

Would they still get the &quot;free&quot; stuff if they weren't playing wow? No. The definition of &quot;paid&quot; has nothing to do with the sustainability you get from the payment. <br />

<br />
Nowadays, when instances have been toned down and people who used to be those top 2% of guilds back in vanilla are steamrolling shit, people want to whine and bitch that content is too easy now? Seriously shut the fuck up lol. Blizzard is trying to please everyone by lowering the amount of people it requires to raid, making raids less difficult, but you'll never be able to make everyone happy, because someone will always whine.<br />

It makes me sad to think that the people who were running around in vanilla with their blues and green screaming at Blizzard about why content is so hard, are the same people now that are bitching because Blizzard tried to cater to you and made instances easier.<br />

No, they aren't &quot;better than me&quot; and they aren't &quot;better&quot; than anyone else really. It's all about perspective. I have a wife and a son that I'd rather spend time with.

I'm sure he is hard and when we finally kill him, I'll enjoy it and savor it. Hopefully, our little 10-man for-fun guild will get to see Algalon too but I don't know. I play for the lore personally. The time it takes me to consume it is unimportant.<br />
<br />
All that being said, I'll offer congrats to Ensidia but I'm being realistic here. All of the other bosses were up on the PTR and had strats ready to go. They played non-stop (excluding the loading screen boss enrage) until it was done. They ARE, arguably, very good players. They work well together. So, yes, congrats to Ensidia.</div></div><hr />

This. It's hilarious to see people complain when the vast majority of people won't even see Alagorn.<br />
<br />
Even more so when plebs say how Ulduar is &quot;cleared&quot; when Alagorn hasn't even been touched yet.</div></div><hr />

Again with talking about stuff you don't know anything about. While allot of guilds, mine to, we will be spending 3-4 nights a week raiding, they do it in 1 night and get the rest of the week to do what they want.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am aware that yes, they are the best guild and they are all perfectly geared up for this, But surely the same was true in the transition from BT to SWP, which i belive the then Nihilum struggled for AGES on (Kil'Jaeden)<br />
<br />
Blizz need to pull their finger out and make content that takes more than a day to clear 90+% of it<br />
<br />
<br />
Easy mode is for casuals to see most of the content in the game, so they can stop complaining that they never get to see the last boss of certain instances and so on.<br />
<br />
Hard mode is for the hardcore raiders who already have no trouble getting through the easy content, can learn the fights without trouble, but want more of a challenge. Much more of a challenge.<br />
<br />
I don't even see how Algalon will be able to be accessed by a pug, much less defeatable by one.<br />
<br />
Sartharion alone was pretty simple. Sarth3D was not nearly as simple, and took quite a bit longer to complete.<br />
<br />
Algalon requires that at least four bosses be completed on hard mode, which is going to be rough even for the better guilds.<br />
<br />
Why is it so hard to understand the difference between normal and hard mode?<br />
<br />
And as well, yes, most of the instance was cleared in one day. But how many of the bosses had been tested over and over again before the actual release? It took time to learn every fight, time they had already spent on the PTR.<br />
<br />
Can people just stop with the QQ about how Ulduar: casual mode has been cleared?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Fair enough statement. It makes sense at face value. Then again we raid twice a week and I don't personally make it to the second night everytime. Many times I don't make it to the first night because of RL obligations.<br />
<br />
The question becomes, is that actually how it works? What are they doing on those other 6 nights. If they're still online playing for 6 hours then your point is invalid. If they're indeed out &quot;getting drunk and laid&quot;, then good on them. Use protection, of course.<br />
<br />
I have no personal animosity to Ensidia. I stated my personal opinion on the whole &quot;hard core&quot; thing but I have nothing against any personal members except for maybe the stupid comments about feral druids and protection paladins in BC.</div></div><hr />

Obviously, 25 man Ulduar easy mode was designed for making most guilds being able to clear it without months of progress. Ensidia (gratz btw!) was able to do this faster then other average guilds mainly because learning the bosses extremely quick (and try them before of course) and for their excellent team-work.<br />
<br />
If, and only if, Ensidia actually are able to kill the hard-mode after a few normal-runs in the same time as normal-clear (10-12h).. Then we have something to discuss about Blizzards achievements with Ulduar. But for now, I think the progress is pretty logical for what a guild like Ensidia might achieve.</div></div><hr />

I think you're spewing a bit too much hyperbole to compare Yogg to normal mode nexus. <br />
<br />
If you read the details on the fight that have been posted, it's no such thing. It sounds like an incredibly exciting and difficult fight out of the box. A lot of coordination, which I'm sure the Ensidia folks have no problem with, as it's obvious they work well together. Look at some of the spells in the fight. Look at the different Insanity debuffs you can get. You can't be facing this person or you can't be more than X yards away.</div></div><hr />

&quot;About 90 minutes of tries later he goes down ! Not a bad fight at all and it will be VERY hard on hard-mode. Definitely going to be a big world first that one.&quot;<br />
<br />
i.e. EZmode is EZmode and they recognise that and aren't QQing like a lot of people on this forum. We'll have another week of competition from next server reset to see who can down the watchers Hard Mode to get to Algalon. Then I suspect once he goes down we'll have another competition to see who can get Yogg down on Hard Mode. Still plenty of content out there to beat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Jealous of people who tested every single fight but Yogg on PTR, clearing the instance and learning an (accessible) boss and killing it the first night? Are people seriously this pathetic?<br />
<br />
Anyway it's true. Their sponsors will drop them if they don't do it. American players aren't getting paid to play the game, hence there's no pressure aside from bragging rights on MMO-Champion, which nobody with half a brain or 1% of a life gives a shit about. <br />
<br />
I played CS in the CPL with one of the top 10 clans in the world for 3 years (1.3-1.5)... while cool for the time being, once you're passed it and you've moved on... you look back at your life for the passed couple years, and you just feel like hanging your head in shame. If anyone tries to say you don't neglect important aspects of your real life to do this shit, I think the only person you're trying to convince is yourself. If you have a gf/wife that &quot;understands&quot; that you need to play for extended periods of time to be the best in the world at a video game, she's probably just as pathetic as you.<br />
<br />

It still is a great achievment. Remember these guys go into a boss fight not knowing any strats and creating their own. Someone said they spent 10 hours on him or something like that. Thats 10 hours of making it up as you go along, no Strat guides, no Boss timers, no having the Perfect Spec. In a month or so, im sure people are going to encounter Yogg-Saron and kill him within 2 hours and they will call it too easy. But they would have all the benefits of the information that guilds like Endidia, For the Horde, Vodka and such guilds give them.</div></div><hr />

Not to diss the point, which is valid, but I think the 90 min's was after they woke up. There was still all the time on him before they went to bed, which I don't think they have specifically stated how long it was. They did say they got in at 3 am, 2 tries on Mimiron and 1 shot on Vezax, which we could say is Max an 1 hour considering how quick they killed the other bosses. They went to bed at 6:30, so thats 2.5h plus the 1.5, thats roughly 4 hours on the boss.</div></div><hr />

Well considering most of the US servers are less stable than a bi-polar off their meds I'm surprised an American guild made it as far as they did.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drak27</div><div class="date">2009-04-16, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow probably homes more sore sports that any game or sport out there. Nobody can just be happy for someone accomplishments. No it got to be followed by some negative comment.<br />
<br />
&quot;it was easy mode&quot; Easy mode in what terms, yes may have been the easiest of the ways to accomplish the fight and probably easy mode for a guild like Ensidia. For about 90% of the guilds in wow easy mode wont be so easy, so before some want to de-credit there accomplishment by saying it was easy mode, why dont you get your guild in there do a full clear then come back and say how easy.<br />
<br />
&quot;well if the U.S. servers....or this server and that server&quot; Why people think if all servers would have been running at 100% uptime with no flaws would have made such a mind boggling difference is beyond me. It like some think Ensidia logged on went into Ulduar and it was like smooth sailing, like their server was just perfect no flaws or crashes or glitches all servers were having issues, their was not the exception. Even so much probably would not have changed i am sure had their server been running smooth they probably would have gotten the kills faster. People are making it seem like had all servers been stable there would have been a drastic change in outcome yeah sure maybe 2 or 3 guilds who got shafted may have been able to put up a fight in the race to down Yogg but other than that not much would have changed.<br />
<br />
&quot;they were on the PTR&quot;... guess what all these guilds who ran over and over in PTR and these guilds who are getting kills on Yogg quickly, well guess what for most of you people should be thanking them, cause these first to the end guilds are the ones that write and post up those nice strategy pages and videos on the boss fights that 90% of guilds use to get through an instance, so you don't have to spend 8+ hours trying to learn the boss, reading the combat log to see what abilities and when. <br />
<br />
The point is, can't people just be happy for someone accomplishments without trying to a find a reason to devalue the accomplishment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are there any EU servers that still are not able to play Ulduar btw due to instances being down? <br />
<br />
Heading to day 3 here in US-Dragonblight and we still can't play due to server stability. Though it seems like both sides suffered. It almost seems like this was a race of who's server was the most stable to play in.<br />
:(<br />
<br />
Hoping we can play Ulduar soon. No luck so far. Gratz to Ensidia though, it just sucks we couldn't see the content yet due to technical issues.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gilfanon</div><div class="date">2009-04-16, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not to diss the point, which is valid, but I think the 90 min's was after they woke up. There was still all the time on him before they went to bed, which I don't think they have specifically stated how long it was. They did say they got in at 3 am, 2 tries on Mimiron and 1 shot on Vezax, which we could say is Max an 1 hour considering how quick they killed the other bosses. They went to bed at 6:30, so thats 2.5h plus the 1.5, thats roughly 4 hours on the boss. <br />
<br />
<br />
My point was that the amount of time they spent on Yogg is pretty irrelevant. Their main aim is the Hard Mode kills and Algalon. They did it normal mode to get the World First for what it's worth, and to look at the fight, get their strats right etc. (the Hard Mode just changes the damage you and Yogg do from what I understand, not necessarily the mechanics of the fight) They seem to understand that. They understand that Normal mode is not for them, it's for Normal people. They still have a challenge ahead of them, but killing YS Normal mode was never going to be their main challenge. Ensidia understand that, but some of the less perceptive people on these boards don't seem to be able to grasp that when they start chucking out ridiculous comments about World of Casualcraft etc.<br />
<br />
The important thing is they seem to think that YS Hard mode is going to be HARD (their emphasis, not mine), which is ultimately what they want- a challenge. Ulduar seems to be living up to what it should be- forgiving in Normal Mode, really difficult in Hard Mode. Until Comms have killed all the content in Hard Mode they really have no right to complain about the difficulty levels.</div></div><hr />

What's interesting is that server population doesn't appear to have anything to do with it. Shandris is a pretty backwater server for the most part and we were having terrible problems. We were planning on making our foray into Ulduar last night.<br />
<br />
We get everyone summoned and ready to go. Everything is running fine. We zone in and do a quick once over of who's taking which vehicles. Everyone gets in front of a vehicle ready to take control and then someone says:<br />
<br />
&quot;Lusi is running in place&quot;<br />
&quot;fuck&quot;<br />
<br />
We're stuck. Chat is still working, of course, so we ask around and of course everyone is seeing it. Someone tries the Alt-F4 method and gets stuck at the loading screen. It's over by that point. Being that I only have 1 level 80, I was pretty much done for the night. About 2 hours later, everything stabilizes but it was WAY past time to even bother. We go take a first look at Emalon with 20 minutes left on the WG timer. That was my night.</div></div><hr />

it's not like it's a surprise Ensidia got the world first. <br />
<br />
Like it was said before post about how easy it is when your guild does it. It all depends on the players and it just so happens that Ensidia is made up of raiders that have been doing this for years.. who DO get payed to play. <br />

<br />
Only it's not, though. If it were so easy, they'd have loot from the hard modes of each boss. They havn't finished the instance yet, they rushed it for the YS kill, and so are locked out of Algalon for 1 week. The race is now to focus on the hardmodes, especially Mimiron, in order to claim the Algalon first kill. Ensidia is basically locked out from this until next week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Instances nowadays are balanced around the fact that every normal guild should be able to down all bosses, not just the top 5% guilds.<br />
<br />
This is why there are hard modes for the top 5% guilds so they can do those and gain extra loot and with ulduar, even an extra boss.<br />
<br />
Ulduar normal mode was never meant to be super hard, so naturally top end guilds were bound to clear it fast.<br />
<br />
-- Wilde<br />
<br />
<br />
You know, actually that is the problem. The fact that Ulduar was not supposed to be hard...that is the problem. A hard mode will ofcourse bring some more skills to the test but...when you actually know a boss that is easy and then do him in hard mode. He actually doesn't become that much harder. Atleast that is my personal experience and my opinion.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is thinking only about money(actually started with deleting the preq's for SSC/TK and the PVP ranks). We can go all out on a OMG BLIZZ LISTEN TO US!!! but that won't work as we have clearly noticed.<br />
<br />
I actually just want to point out the following example and then you guys could discuss about it as adults or flame it like the bastards(that most of you) are.<br />
<br />
Mister.A and Mister.B both want to become Footballplayers.<br />
<br />
They both have great potential but...Mister.A has more talent, is faster, has more technique and he sees the game and sees all the angles.<br />
<br />
Mister.B on the other hand is not that much talented, he isn't that fast. His technique is OK, for a guy that plays on the street or for a amateur club, and he has limited view of the game.<br />
<br />
They probably both want to play for a team as Manchester United, Real Madrid, Barcalona or AC Milan. <br />
<br />
Though, we know that Mister.B just doesn't have the abilities to do so, therefore he goes to play for a second division club or even third. Mister.A is doing great and gets a contract from Manchester United.<br />
<br />

I agree, this people's ignorance is incredible...

100% correct. Patch day, my server was down for about 8 hours longer than expected followed up with Ulduar crashing all evening and into the next day. Then crashing again all day Wednesday, finally culminating in all raids (Naxx included) taking one big massive dump for about half hour before they came back up with some serious problems like some players being unable to enter a raid.<br />

Grats on the kill however!</div></div><hr />

Full 24? Sorry no.<br />
<br />
It is 18 hours, and EU had 5 hours shorter maintenance. So we are at 13. Then XT trash was basically impossible and took guilds hours, so lets say 11 hours. So US had at best an 11 hour ahead start, and the majority of those 11 hours were in times when no one raids. Really I would be absolutely shocked if more than 5 US guilds had/spent more time in a functional Ulduar than Ensidia.<br />

Now, we just have to sum all their time since the 1st PTR test and we can get a feeling of how long it would take to clear Ulduar (except Algalon).<br />

<br />
If ensidia was on my server, they still wouldn't have downed the first boss.<br />
If ensidia was on my server, half their raid would be constantly stuck in instance transfer.<br />
If ensidia was on my server, the hardest boss would be the disconnects and constant crashes.<br />
<br />
It really comes down to luck, we haven't been able to try Ulduar for the last two days. That's a real handicap.<br />
<br />
<br />
i would just like to say... THIS</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aleom</div><div class="date">2009-04-16, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd like to start off saying congratulations to Ensidia. You guys pushed hard, stayed up late, probably loaded up on caffine just to keep going, and even with your competitors here in the US having a good half a day head start, you guys still managed to push through and come out on top with a Yogg kill. <br />
<br />
Big Grats and keep up the good work. <br />
<br />
<br />
Now, for the REST of you, I have a few things to say. <br />
1) &quot;QQ Moar&quot;<br />
2) I've seen this argument repeated a lot lately. This thing where a guild will get a first and someone will reply with &quot;Well (insert something else here) is the REAL challenge. This is a never ending argument that people use until the &quot;side&quot;, for lack of a better term, they're rooting for comes out on top. Here's exactly how it's going to work, and you can see it already:<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you got Yogg? Well Yogg Hard Mode is the real challenge, amirite?&quot; <br />
&quot;Oh, you got Yogg Hard Mode? Well, Algalon is the real challenge, amirite?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, you got Algalon? Well getting your Ironbound Proto-drake is the real challenge, amirite?&quot; <br />
&quot;Oh, you got your Drake? Well, World First Lich King kill is the real challenge, amirite?&quot;<br />
<br />
This argument will go on and on and on simply because you're not satisfied or your ego is deflated over something being beaten quickly or your country not getting the &quot;first&quot; or whatever e-peen issue is presenting itself. 'Tis just a game. <br />
<br />
3) and last of all people seem to be complaining about how *cough* &quot;fast&quot; Ulduar was defeated. You DO realize these people who have cleared it represent a level of raiding and determination that 95% of guilds out there, mine and yours included, do not represent. These are people who farmed BiS on everything, min/maxed their professions, had every single slot in their bag filled with haste pots, mana pots, food buffs and consumables that were used without hesitation on EVERY fight without bitching over the cost. They carried with them tons of enchanting mats so that every single upgrade that dropped could be gemmed and enchanted on the spot to always ensure the best possible performance. This is a level of coordination and skill that is not found in the game. It will be MONTHS before that other 95% of guilds out there actually begin to clear Ulduar. <br />
<br />
Ulduar isn't &quot;beaten&quot; yet. It won't be for months to come. <br />

I'm surprised that KT25 drops the same level loot as Yogg Saron 25. KT already has a huge loot table, so a lot of these items will look like clones (such as with this cloak). Yeah, it's easy mode, but I'm surprised the loot isn't at least 232 on everything or something of the sort, because we've all been farming KT for a long time now. I wouldn't mind seeing another 232 TTT clone though, but it still feels like an oversight.</div></div><hr />

For all of you talking smack like this i can tell you have not raided Ulduar on a US server or AT ALL. Ensidia downed it in 18 hours straight am i correct? My server personally has not been up for 18 hours at one time especially during raid times. IMO progression this patch is screwed completely while i won't deny the fact that Ensidia is the best guild in the world because it is obviously true, but no one has a had a fair night of raiding yet on US servers. And who cares about &quot;Vanilla WoW&quot; honestly were in WoTLK move on that was years ago i would say a good portion of those people don't play anymore. Also Ensidia can not link any world firsts except for maybe WoTLK naxx and ulduar i dont follow when they actually formed. But they are a combined guild so get your facts straight and quit ranting your man pleaser on my forums.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And a reminder to those saying 'remember how long it took for M'uru/KJ/Four Horseman?' Well, those were the final raids of their respective progressions, this certainly isn't. Though I have a disappointing feeling Arthas won't be as tough as he ought to be, 3.4 should still be a giant step in progressive difficulty (I hope.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think it's an issue of the sponsor being Saudi or even sour grapes that they have a sponsor. At least in the US, there's a pretty clear line between amateur and professional. The NCAA (college sports group) doesn't let ANY athlete accept ANY gifts, cash or otherwise (generally speaking) because it somewhat affects the perception of balance in a given sport. The perception is that there is supposed to be a balance between getting an education and participating in sports. If you're getting &quot;paid&quot; to play for a particular school then a) you're not an amateur and b) it removes any athletic ability from the equation and puts it in the hands of the school with the biggest and richest alumni association.<br />
<br />
Now most of that is utter bullshit. My personal estimation is that 75-80% of the kids who go into college on an athletic scholarship have no intention of doing anything but playing sports professionally. College is just the gateway. The schools with the biggest boosters and alumni associations STILL attract the most talent because those schools are just nicer in general.<br />
<br />
Mind you, I'm a raving capitalist pig. I have no problem with someone paying someone else to play a freaking video game. It strikes me as a poor management decision but whatever.<br />
<br />
The reason so many people bring it up as it relates to WoW is that, if they being &quot;paid to play&quot; (regardless of what that means...that discussion is over), they have an unfair advantage outside of the other people playing. MOST WoW subscribers have external factors that limit the time they play. I have a wife and a 9 month old son. Others have school. There's a natural balance there. You can't play 24x7 because you have to work, study, feed the kid, go to family events or do whatever. Being &quot;paid to play&quot; strips out that balance and creates an &quot;unfair&quot; situation in that it gives the paid players an external advantage. You don't have to worry about staying up all night and being late into the office because you're being paid to do that. You get hardware handed to you by manufacturers for instance. Maybe you even get so &quot;popular&quot; that you get preferential treatment from the game manufacturer. ( I don't buy this theory in the least but I'm giving you a perception some people might have).<br />
<br />
Some people, and I think rightly so, thinks that being paid to rush through the content cheapens the accomplishment. <br />
<br />
Again, as was discussed previously, no one except Ensidia knows the full details of whatever backing they get. I doubt seriously they would open up any books if they had them. It's honestly no one else's business but expect people to have perceptions as long as it's out there.</div></div><hr />

Nerd Rage is funny :D<br />
<br />
You was the one complaining about a video game. Ive had my fair share of World top 50 kills at least (never been in top 10) and just get annoyed by new players who think they are the shizzle, when they clearly arent.<br />
<br />
Then when a tiny amount of challenging content appears, they come up with all these excuses why they didnt get World first.<br />

Most people seem to forget alot of EU players play on US Servers, and alot of US players play on EU servers aswell.<br />
<br />
When we talk about EU and US we arent really talking about country of people, rather where the servers are located.</div></div><hr />

(especially after reading all the childish US/EU whining) Be thankful you can play the instance, and congrats of having a battlegroup with an appropriate amount of blade servers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No No, you mistook me.<br />
<br />
I been arguing Ulduar is very easy compared to Vanilla and TBC raids.<br />
<br />
What i was saying was that its more challenging than Naxxramas, and all these new WoTLK players who pew pew'ed NAxx and thought they was as skilled as the best guilds in the World, that when something slightly challenging appears they start QQ saying &quot;zomg game is too hard, i want my free welfare epics QQ&quot;<br />
<br />
That was what i was saying if you get my point :)<br />
<br />
btw i know how hard Sunwell was, i got a World Top 50 kill on Muru and KJ :)<br />
<br />
Muru prenerfed (and im talking about when the AoE actually gave spell pushback aswell, the very very first version), was one of the hardest bosses i have ever killed. (we killed him pre pre nerfed, but the pre pre nerfed version where only the spell pushback was hotfixed)</div></div><hr />

<br />
To all of the people saying that Ulduar is too easy now that Yogg has been beaten:<br />
Ensidia did not clear Ulduar, they beat the 2nd from last boss. If they succeed in clearing all of the hard modes, inlcuding Alg, next tuesday, then you can think about complaining. Even then though, you shouldn't complain about its ease until you've cleared it on all hard mode numerous times. Yes, people who are 50 times better at this game than you, and by that i mean 99.9999% of players, were able to complete the instance. That doesn't mean anything. Ulduar's true difficulty can't really be measured until the next patch comes out, when we can look back and see how successful the average guild was at completing it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Oh, you got Yogg? Well Yogg Hard Mode is the real challenge, amirite?&quot; <br />
&quot;Oh, you got Yogg Hard Mode? Well, Algalon is the real challenge, amirite?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, you got Algalon? Well getting your Ironbound Proto-drake is the real challenge, amirite?&quot; <br />
&quot;Oh, you got your Drake? Well, World First Lich King kill is the real challenge, amirite?&quot;<br />
<br />
This argument will go on and on and on simply because you're not satisfied or your ego is deflated over something being beaten quickly or your country not getting the &quot;first&quot; or whatever e-peen issue is presenting itself. 'Tis just a game. <br />
<br />
<br />
welcome to an online RPG? ... this game will never 'end' there will always be something else to do.. thats how these people make their money... so yes.. its never over.. never..... untill they pull the plug, there will always be +1 things to do... has nothing to do with ego.. <br />
<br />
I agree with you on most other othings tho.</div></div><hr />

lol.. yes.. because having only 1/4 of the instance available then slowly opening access to boss's is challenging....<br />
sunwell would have been cleared in 1 reset if it wasn't for the gates.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Two things to say about this - <br />
<br />
1) EU &gt; US<br />
2) No one cares about achievements or hard modes ;)<br />
<br />
Hard modes are cool as something else to do, but the fact is, Ulduar was cleared already, and that is all that matters.<br />

Blizzard fuck ups US servers so we cant get the World First Kill, It was a conspiracy.....EU servers came up = no problems at all, which makes EU Guild get smooth run....<br />
<br />
Maybe Ensidia sponsors paid Blizz tons of money to fuck up US servers....but we all understand Business comes first...so they dint wanna see Ensidia lose their sponsor<br />
<br />
Now watch how smooth US servers will run after Ensidia got World First Kill<br />

<br />
Actually just being able to get into Ulduar is proof that the EU servers are running more smoothly than 80%+ US servers. The results would probably still be similiar, but acting like the US has had near as fair chances at the world first due just to the server instability is incredibly ignorant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes Ensidia might be the best guild in the world but there are alot of other guilds that are great and full of dedicated people.<br />
Alot of guilds that consider themselves hardcore will probably struggle for weeks to clear just the easy modes and then there¬¥s hardmode aswell.<br />
<br />
I went to nax for the first time tonight and it was refreshing to wipe on trash and ralise that you couldn¬¥t just pull and aoe things down like nax.<br />
Great place and one that will probably last for months for most guilds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is why there are hard modes for the top 5% guilds so they can do those and gain extra loot and with ulduar, even an extra boss.<br />
<br />
Ulduar normal mode was never meant to be super hard, so naturally top end guilds were bound to clear it fast.<br />

Exactly, everyone should understand this by now.</div></div><hr />
