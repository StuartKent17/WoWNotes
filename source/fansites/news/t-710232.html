Cataclysm - General 
Q: Do you intend to have all 280% flying mounts scale to 310% when a 310% mount is earned, or will only purchased mounts do so? 
A: Our current plan, is that in Cataclysm, you can learn a new rank of flying that lets all flying mounts move at 310% (even current 280% mounts). That will probably be as fast as mounts will ever get. We don’t like it that when you get a 310% mount that you stop using your old ones.

Cataclysm - General<br />
Q: Do you intend to have all 280% flying mounts scale to 310% when a 310% mount is earned, or will only purchased mounts do so?<br />
A: Our current plan, is that in Cataclysm, you can learn a new rank of flying that lets all flying mounts move at 310% (even current 280% mounts). That will probably be as fast as mounts will ever get. We don’t like it that when you get a 310% mount that you stop using your old ones.<br />
<br />
Q: If 310% speed is becoming trainable, does that mean we'll be able to fly in Azeroth from the get-go?<br />
A: We have considered the concept of “Old Weather Flying.” Just kidding. More than likely, you’ll just be able to fly from the beginning.<br />
<br />
Q. You mentioned at BlizzCon that all races would be getting revamped racial abilities. Care to shed some light on any of them?<br />
A. We’re going to do something similar to what we did in Wrath of the Lich King, where we just refresh them to make sure they’re balanced and feel cool. Something you could see is dwarves getting a bonus to Archeology, or undead getting a new activated racial ability that will be more useful in PvE.<br />
<br />
Q: Can you give us some more information on how and what Path of the Titans will reward you with? Talent points? Unlock talents?<br />
A: The Paths unlock a new kind of glyph called an Ancient Glyph. These don’t enhance class abilities, since they are designed to work with any class. They do grant bonuses that might be useful to a wide variety of characters as well as offer some actual new abilities as well. If you think your action bar is full, then you may want to head for the passive bonuses instead of the active abilities.<br />
<br />
Q: Will the new guild perk system kill a lot of smaller guilds?<br />
A: Our goal is not to encourage players to have to change their existing guild. We realize some players like smaller guilds and some like larger guilds and we don’t want to ask you to change that.<br />
<br />
Q: What improvements to the UI are being considered (particularly for raid healing)?<br />
A: We would like to update the default Blizzard UI. It has some fatal flaws, such as not being able to show buffs and debuffs simultaneously. We probably won’t ever go as crazy as some of the mods out there just because they provide a ton of customization, which is one of the things players like about them. We do think players deserve a raid UI that is fully functional for those players who just don’t like to install a lot of mods. We hope to get this change in for Cataclysm, but we’re changing the UI for the spell book, talent pane, professions window, character stats, guild, friends and probably a dozen things I’m forgetting, so it’s just a matter of how much time we have. <br />
<br />
Q: What kinds of UI updates are planned for Cataclysm. Eclipse and Soul Shards are two, but any others?<br />
A: We have already moved professions from the skill tab to an awesome new page on the spell book. In fact, in the absence of weapon skills, we got rid of the skill tab entirely. We have a new talent tree UI that shows all of the talent trees without scrolling and provides the passive bonuses as well. We’re changing the glyph UI to support Paths of the Titans. We’re changing the PvP queue UI to support rated Battlegrounds. We’d like to improve the V-nameplate feature. We’d like to provide more information when you level up about what new spells or features are now available to you. We’re experimenting with better ways to organize buffs and debuffs and communicate procs and cooldowns too.<br />
<br />
Q: What change are you most excited about?<br />
A: We are changing the old zones probably more than most players realize. A place like Stonetalon is virtually unrecognizable. It has all new quests and item rewards and dramatic changes to the landscape. A zone like Western Plaguelands has actually been updated to reflect the fact that the Scourge are in retreat (which is not to say that the zone is without its dangers). Everywhere you’re going to see something new and surprising. I think a lot of players are excited about the level 80-85 experience (as they should be!) and the goblin and worgen zones (which if anything are better than the death knight starter zone, if you can believe that), but I think a lot of players are going to want to reroll new character of existing races and classes just to see how much everything has changed.<br />
<br />
Masteries<br />
Q: Can you go into more detail on Vengeance? As it stands it sounds like off tanks will be at a significant disadvantage.<br />
A: We want Vengeance to have a long enough duration that off tanks won’t lose their damage bonus. In most situations, the off tank is doing some tanking along the way. The worst case scenario would be say a fight where the off tank needs to tank in phase 3 but not phase 1. Remember, even in that case though you have tools to generate high threat. Vengeance is there to keep DPS from pulling off you late in the fight.<br />
<br />
Q: With armor class bringing mastery bonuses, will players never want to &quot;downrank&quot; from, say, leather to cloth?<br />
A: That’s the idea, really. They still can wear the older armor, but they’ll lose some stats from doing so. <br />
<br />
Q: Can you allow points spent in your off tree give a diminished amount of mastery bonus toward your main tree so as to not nerf hybrid specs?<br />
A: Does the Elemental shaman really want more melee damage though? Does the Shadow priest really want to heal better? If anything it feels like it would be a nerf to hybrids, since a warlock would get more damage from any tree, while a DPS hybrid might only get more damage from their tree.<br />
<br />
If hybrids end up coming out a little short, we’ll compensate in other ways (such as more oomph in talents) instead of doing hacky things with the mastery system.<br />
<br />
Q: Compared to some third mastery bonuses (radiance etc) others are a little boring (+crit damage etc) Intended? Comments?<br />
A: The mastery bonuses are obviously a really new concept. The risk on the one hand is that they’re too boring and don’t affect gameplay and on the other extreme they take specs which already have a lot going on and just make them overcomplicated. For now we wanted to implement a range and see what feels the best in beta. We expect to iterate on these a lot.<br />
<br />
Class Mechanics<br />
Q: How will haste affect channeled spells. Will it be similar to DoTs and HoTs?<br />
A: They will channel faster but their duration will remain unchanged. You will get more ticks on the same cast. <br />
<br />
Q: When does the homogenization of classes stop? Paladins are starting to look like priests. Where is the diversity?<br />
A: We want the challenge of beating PvE encounters or enemy teams in PvP to be how awesome you are at strategizing, not how often you are at recruiting the right classes. While it is very, very important to us for classes to feel different, it’s also very important to us that friends get to play together.<br />
<br />
Q. Is every healer supposed to be able to tank-heal efficiently, or will we still see specs excel in it more than others?<br />
A. Each healer is intended to have a different niche, and different strengths. Such as Restoration druids with HoTs, or paladins at direct healing, Discipline priests at absorption/prevention, etc. That said, each healer should be able to keep up a tank and have some deeper “tank healing gameplay” as they do now.<br />
<br />
Q: How will &quot;active spell is more powerful&quot; be handled with no more dot clipping?<br />
A: How about we get rid of “a more powerful spell is active” altogether? If you have some bonehead overwriting your more powerful buff or debuff, we’d rather you handle that issue socially. <br />
<br />
Cataclysm - Raids &amp; Dungeons<br />
Q: Can you make crowd control in raids and 5-mans an important aspect of the PvE game again?<br />
A: An emphatic yes. <br />
<br />
Q: With more players raiding in Wrath of the Lich King than ever before, do you plan to raise the difficulty to accommodate our new skill/experience?<br />
A: The heroic difficulty is designed for the players looking for more of a challenge. One of the things we learned from Icecrown is that we unlocked the heroic modes so late that players had tons of practice on the encounters on normal mode, so the step up was smaller than it was in say Ulduar when players on hard mode were still learning some of the encounter basics. (In our defense though, because of the time of year we released Icecrown we made a conscious decision to not ask players to choose between holiday events and hard-mode raiding.) <br />
<br />
Q: Will Ragnaros have a new weapon in Cataclysm, considering that we stole and reforged his? I'm sure he's not happy about that either.<br />
A: Oh come on, it never actually dropped for you. Then again, is there really much demand for a Strength, Stamina, Fire resist, cosmetic Fireball proc weapon? :)<br />
<br />
Cataclysm - Items<br />
Q: Will relics and wands be getting any new attention in Cataclysm?<br />
A: With relics, the plan is to make them class agnostic. In other words, there might be a +strength relic that a death knight or paladin might want to equip. We think that will let us add more of them to the game without them being so specialized. They will feel more like wands.<br />
<br />
How to make wands and relics a bigger part of gameplay is something we’ve had many, many discussions on. Ultimately though we’d rather see warlocks, mages and priests casting their spells, not zapping someone with a wand. In Cataclysm we don’t expect to see much wanding, even at lower level.<br />
<br />
Q: What will happen to our gems and enchants on gear that give us stats that are being removed in Cataclysm ?<br />
A: We are going to change most gems and enchants that have obsolete stats like armor pen and defense..<br />
<br />
Q: When you say you're going to make relics class agnostic, does it include druids' idols as well?<br />
A: Druid, shaman, paladin and death knight. It’s possible we will still keep some that are very specific to certain classes and specs. Overall though we’re not happy with the current design where an ability procs a buff on you. If it’s an ability you don’t use often, then the item is terrible, so they end up feeling really passive already. At the same time, the fact that we have to offer so many prevents us from ever giving you the choice of which one to use. So we make the Resto druid or Enhance shaman version every new tier. It would be a more interesting decision if there was a crit + Intellect relic and a haste + Intellect relic, and you can choose which one to use.<br />
<br />
Player vs. Player<br />
Q. Thanks for having this chat! I have to say that I feel many changes are PvP-oriented. Is the game shifting more toward PvP?<br />
A. What we’re trying to do at this point in the game is make abilities more niche and interesting, rather than adding Sinister Strike with a different name. A lot of talents and abilities we add initially only seem to have a PvP role at first glance, but eventually also prove useful in PvE situations too (examples are Dispersion, Body &amp; Soul, or Typhoon).<br />
<br />
Q. Will there be as much effort put into making tanking specs viable in PvP? Will Vengeance be useful in PvP?<br />
A. Our goal is to make all specs as viable as we can in as many aspects of the game as possible. Currently some tank specs are not so much viable as they are overpowered (because their damage is competitive and survivability is off the charts), so that issue will have to be addressed when we start to flesh them out as more attractive and mainstream PvP spec options.<br />
<br />

Q: With the change to death knight tanking, Blood being the tank spec, what AoE aggro moves (besides Death and Decay and Pestilence) will we have to use?<br />
A: We think Death and Decay and Pestilence are pretty good. We’ll add another ability if we think it’s needed, but remember, the “round things up and AE them down” strategy isn’t going to be as effective in Cataclysm until you out-gear instances.<br />
<br />
Q: Will Dark Simulacrum work on bosses? or at least be useful in PvE?<br />
A: It will work on any spell you can Spell Reflect, which is actually quite a few bosses. Remember, Dark Simulacrum doesn’t cancel the incoming damage so in that sense it is easier for us to balance letting death knights use it in PvE. Also be careful considering new spells for old encounters. The encounter designers will make the new encounters with the new spells in mind.<br />
<br />
Q: I still don't get the motivation to redo the death knight rune system. It's been a couple years and now that it seems close, why do it all over?<br />
A: Many death knights felt like they didn’t have enough global cooldowns (GCDs) to use their abilities. In some cases, the rune system started to matter less than the GCDs to hit the right button. We want death knights to have to make choices about what abilities come next. When you see DKs play today, it looks like they’re playing the piano – hitting buttons so fast. We need to buy them some room in their rotation to be able to take advantage of say procs or runes coming back sooner than expected.<br />
<br />
Q: Did the developers learn anything from the death knight release that they plan to keep in mind for any possible future classes?<br />
A: Um, maybe we won’t listen to community feedback about how classes need more abilities, damage and survivability? (Just kidding.) :) Adding a new class is very challenging, which is one reason we don’t want to do it every expansion. It’s a really good question though, and we’d like to give a little more thought to how to answer it (when we aren’t fielding so many Twitter questions).<br />

Q. Why are Restoration druids the only spec in the game not receiving a new spell?<br />
A. Restoration druids are actually getting a fair bit. For one, Tree of Life is getting a whole new model (think Ancients of War) and will also “morph” some of your spells to do crazy things while in the form, such as cause Regrowth to be instant, or Lifebloom to apply two applications at once. Tranquility will be raid-wide. We’re also touching nearly every Restoration druid spell to make sure each has a niche and feels good. In general, playing a Restoration druid should feel a lot different (better!) in Cataclysm than it does today. <br />
<br />
Q. What change are you most excited about?<br />
A. Some of the new Balance talents for druids, like Solar Beam, which works like Freya’s spell where it instantly silences a target and they have to move out of the beam to get rid of the debuff. <br />
<br />

Q. Will there be any new pet families added, or will we simply see more additions to existing ones?<br />
A. We're not sure yet whether we’re adding new pet families or not. It’s possible. Expect to see some monkeys, foxes and other new pet possibilities though!<br />
<br />
Q: Does the Marksman mastery (Double Shot) work like the Wild Quiver talent (provide a free autoshot) or like the Lightning Overload talent (a free whatever spell you just cast)? In other words, can Double Shot fire a second Chimera Shot?<br />
A: Double Shot is a half-strength autoshot. Wild Quiver will increase the damage of the autoshot to 60-70% (or something similar). Lightning Overload (the talent) will likewise increase the magnitude of the Elemental Overload mechanic. <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/mage.jpg Mage (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/class-mage/) / Talent Calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?mage))<br />
Q: Why are you giving Mages more Crowd Control?<br />
A: We like for classes and specs to have themes. Part of the mage kit is control. Part of the warrior kit is mobility. We like to reinforce those designs rather than give classes new abilities that remove their weaknesses. Weaknesses are supposed to be something you keep in mind while you’re playing. I’m sure Ret paladins would love Heroic Leap and warriors would love Polymorph, but that plugs a hole really, really well where you risk being a one person army who doesn’t need to be supported by other players in PvP or PvE. Obviously it risk homogenizing all the classes as well. <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/paladin.jpg Paladin (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/class-paladin/) / Talent Calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?paladin))<br />
Q: Will healing hands be a paladin-centered tranquility, or something we have to run around to keep people in range of?<br />
A: The idea is that it matters where the paladin is, so it won’t be raid-wide like Tranquility will be in Cataclysm. We will make sure the magnitude of the heal is sufficient that it’s a button the paladin wants to use. The cooldown and duration aren’t set in stone either.<br />
<br />
Q: Now that paladin's Holy Shock is baseline is there any plans to change the Art of War talent?<br />
A: We like Art of War, so we don’t expect it will go away. We understand the concern that Holy Shock might compete with Art of War a little bit in terms of role (an instant damage spell) and that’s something we’re going to have to address. <br />
<br />
Q. What information/ideas can you share on PvP utility in the Retribution tree? Mandatory gap closer/interrupt question. Not having a cleanse will hurt. :\<br />
A. Retribution paladins will be getting an interrupt. :) <br />
<br />

Q. Could the Shadow priest's Mastery bonus instead be something more distinctive from shaman shield orbs (like shadow ravens)?<br />
A. The original “fantasy”; behind the Mastery bonus is that you’re storing shadows through combat with you, that you can unleash out using Mind Blast or Mind Spike for more burst damage. We're not sure about ravens or how that relates to a Shadow priest, but we’re definitely going to do some unique art for them. <br />
<br />

Q: Is Smoke Bomb going to be usable in boss fights? Because it looks like it could cheat a lot of mechanics.<br />
A: Potentially, yes. It essentially follows the same room of line-of-sight. If standing around a pillar lets you avoid a boss ability, then Smoke Bomb would too. Lady Deathwhisper’s adds for example, would run up to melee you if you were in a Smoke Bomb.<br />
<br />
Q. With the emphasis moving to Battlegrounds, have you looked into rogue cooldown dependency issues?<br />
A. We definitely want to give rogues a considerable boost in the passive damage reduction department, and then tone down some of their active cooldowns in the process. We still want the rogue to feel twitchy and exciting to play, but not to the extent that you can’t deal with another class toe-to-toe without any cooldowns up. Oh, and Cloak of Shadows now provides 100% resistance. :)<br />
<br />

Q: Are there any plans to separate the mana regeneration mechanic and the damage reduction mechanic that is in Shamanistic Rage?<br />
A: It’s a drawback we’re aware of and one we’re looking at. We don’t have a change that we’re ready to announce. <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/warlock.jpg Warlock (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/class-warlock/) / Talent Calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?warlock))<br />
Q. With all the new changes to Demonology warlocks, do you plan to implement any threat reduction talent unique for Demonology?<br />
A. Threat is something that we want to be binary. You should only really ever worry about pulling threat from a tank during the first thirty seconds or so, when the tank is still establishing threat, not two minutes in because your DPS was too high. In a nutshell, we’ll make sure you don’t have to stop DPS during a fight because of your threat level (ala Hodir).<br />
<br />
Q. Any plans for an untalented spell to help warlocks deal with stuns?<br />
A. Possibly. It’s also possible we may take a look at stuns in general. But overall stuns will feel less impacting in an environment where players have significantly more health than they do today.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/warrior.jpg Warrior (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/class-warrior/) / Talent Calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?warrior))<br />
Q: Any plans to give Fury Warriors more hit from precision or another talent due to the removal of Heroic Strike as&quot;next weapon&quot; hit?<br />
A: Part of the problem is that Fury warriors undervalue hit as it is because of the way Heroic Strike works today. We’ll make sure they do appropriate damage with the new model, but that probably won’t be with a talent that says “I don’t have to worry about getting hit for my gear.”<br />
<br />
Q: Will Protection Warriors have improved AoE tanking in Cataclysm?<br />
A: We will make sure they don’t feel gimp compared to the other 3 tanks. We’re not going to give them an ability that they can just spam endlessly to maintain AE threat. We think Thunder Clap and Shockwave already work well for that. We want you to have to manage threat, but we don’t want it to be insanely hard to manage. (You also might be doing less AE tanking in Cataclysm overall.)<br />
<br />
Miscellaneous<br />
Q: Where is my moose?<br />
A: Well, we’re looking for a zone where moose would really fit. Unfortunately we did the perfect zone for them, Grizzly Hills, already. On the other hand, let’s just say we have a large, Egyptian-themed desert zone in Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Q: What are your plans to eliminate the pollution problem in Azeroth? Motorcycles, planes, methane from Kodo gas, venture company????<br />
A: Well on the one hand, there will be more druids with trolls and worgen joining the ranks. On the other hand, there will be more goblins, and you know, goblins just don’t care. They have this section in Orgrimmar where they have their little beach chairs set up to look out on a view of oil drums floating in the lake. On the third (?) hand, you’ll be cleaning up the toxic waste in Gnomeregan if you can retake it!<br />
<br />
Q: I've been playing since vanilla. The consciousness you've applied to make this game grow is praiseworthy. Thank you.<br />
A: You’re welcome! One of the challenges of Cataclysm is to change enough to be exciting but not so much that the game feels unrecognizable to long-term fans. A lot is changing, but it’s still World of Warcraft.</div></div><hr />

Q: Will healing hands be a paladin-centered tranquility, or something we have to run around to keep people in range of?<br />
A: The idea is that it matters where the paladin is, so it won’t be raid-wide like Tranquility will be in Cataclysm. We will make sure the magnitude of the heal is sufficient that it’s a button the paladin wants to use. The cooldown and duration aren’t set in stone either.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tranquility will be raid wide? or heal anyone in your group regardless of range?</div></div><hr />

A: We are going to change most gems and enchants that have obsolete stats like armor pen and defense..<br />
<br />
Q: Will Dark Simulacrum work on bosses? or at least be useful in PvE?<br />
A: It will work on any spell you can Spell Reflect, which is actually quite a few bosses. Remember, Dark Simulacrum doesn’t cancel the incoming damage so in that sense it is easier for us to balance letting death knights use it in PvE.<br />
<br />
Also be careful considering new spells for old encounters. The encounter designers will make the new encounters with the new spells in mind.<br />
<br />
Q: Are there any plans to separate the mana regeneration mechanic and the damage reduction mechanic that is in Shamanistic Rage?<br />
A: It’s a drawback we’re aware of and one we’re looking at. We don’t have a change that we’re ready to announce. <br />

Q: If 310% speed is becoming trainable, does that mean we'll be able to fly in Azeroth from the get-go? <br />

A. Restoration druids are actually getting a fair bit. For one, Tree of Life is getting a whole new model (think Ancients of War) and will also “morph” some of your spells to do crazy things while in the form, such as cause Regrowth to be instant, or Lifebloom to apply two applications at once. Tranquility will be raid-wide. We’re also touching nearly every Restoration druid spell to make sure each has a niche and feels good. In general, playing a Restoration druid should feel a lot different (better!) in Cataclysm than it does today.<br />

i already have a 310% speed mount, so im curious whether i will still have to purchase training, since i prefer a couple of my 280% speed ones and would rather not have to waste the gold.</div></div><hr />

Besides being a cool looking mount, it's an actual reward for your effort. Taking that away so that anyone with X gold can fly at 310% would suck hard. They might as well roll out the Red Carpet now with the words: Hard-Core Raiders that worked for those 310% Mounts, Welcome to Hell. Casuals - Welcome to Casualcraft.<br />

I guess your question was really with no dot clipping whether &quot;new lesser dot&quot; really wins or if it refreshes the more powerful dot? I think they answered that question:<br />
<br />
(powerful dot + new lesser dot) exclusive ? powerful dot wins OTHERWISE powerful dot and lesser dot.<br />
<br />
If they get rid of the &quot;a more powerful spell is active&quot; mechanic then:<br />

(powerful dot + new lesser dot) exclusive ? new lesser dot wins OTHERWISE powerful dot and lesser dot.</div></div><hr />

A: We would like to update the default Blizzard UI. It has some fatal flaws, such as not being able to show buffs and debuffs simultaneously. We probably won’t ever go as crazy as some of the mods out there just because they provide a ton of customization, which is one of the things players like about them. We do think players deserve a raid UI that is fully functional for those players who just don’t like to install a lot of mods. We hope to get this change in for Cataclysm, but we’re changing the UI for the spell book, talent pane, professions window, character stats, guild, friends and probably a dozen things I’m forgetting, so it’s just a matter of how much time we have. <br />
<br />
<br />
Now that is some exciting news. The default UI is anything but good.</div></div><hr />

A: Our current plan, is that in Cataclysm, you can learn a new rank of flying that lets all flying mounts move at 310% (even current 280% mounts). That will probably be as fast as mounts will ever get. We don’t like it that when you get a 310% mount that you stop using your old ones.<br />
<br />
My question is..<br />
<br />
Is everyone going to have the chance to learn a 310% mount or is it just us that have one now that can turn our 280's into 310? if everyone can have a 310% in cata what was the point of giving them as hard to get rewards in WotLK, ie naxx, ulduar and icc hardmodes?</div></div><hr />

In other words, can Double Shot fire a second Chimera Shot?<br />
<br />
A: Double Shot is a half-strength autoshot. Wild Quiver will increase the damage of the autoshot to 60-70% (or something similar). Lightning Overload (the talent) will likewise increase the magnitude of the Elemental Overload mechanic.<br />
<br />
This is definitely wrong stated by the developer, as wild quiver is suppose to “You have a 12% chance to shoot an additional shot when doing damage with your auto shot, dealing 80% weapon nature damage. Wild Quiver consumes no ammo.”<br />
<br />
This is blatantly stupid as someone with no knowledge of hunter mechanism to talk about hunter.<br />
<br />
Edit: K there might be posibility that the developer is saying that the new wild quiver will increase the damage of the autoshot to 60-70%, if thats the case, not bad... o.O</div></div><hr />

Q. Could the Shadow priest's Mastery bonus instead be something more distinctive from shaman shield orbs (like shadow ravens)?<br />
A. The original “fantasy”; behind the Mastery bonus is that you’re storing shadows through combat with you, that you can unleash out using Mind Blast or Mind Spike for more burst damage. We're not sure about ravens or how that relates to a Shadow priest, but we’re definitely going to do some unique art for them.<br />

In other words, can Double Shot fire a second Chimera Shot?<br />
<br />
A: Double Shot is a half-strength autoshot. Wild Quiver will increase the damage of the autoshot to 60-70% (or something similar). Lightning Overload (the talent) will likewise increase the magnitude of the Elemental Overload mechanic.<br />
<br />
This is definitely wrong stated by the developer, as wild quiver is suppose to “You have a 12% chance to shoot an additional shot when doing damage with your auto shot, dealing 80% weapon nature damage. Wild Quiver consumes no ammo.”<br />
<br />
This is blatantly stupid as someone with no knowledge of hunter mechanism to talk about hunter.<br />
<br />
Edit: K there might be posibility that the developer is saying that the new wild quiver will increase the damage of the autoshot to 60-70%, if thats the case, not bad... o.O<br />
<br />
<br />
You must be retarded. I wouldn't normally say that, but you came off like an ass in your post. Take a second and think or at least ask a question before saying shit like that. What he said was very clear.<br />
<br />
The Double Shot proc is a 50% damage autoshot which takes the place of the Wild Quiver proc. So instead the Wild Quiver talent will increase the damage of that Double Shot proc from 50% to something like 70%, around the current Wild Quiver proc damage.</div></div><hr />

There's like a 99.999999999999999999999% chance it'll be melee range, meaning since cleanse won't remove magic for ret and paladins lack a gap closer (JoJ doesn't count IMO), if Hand of Freedom is on cd a simple slow or snare will keep them a safe difference away.

<br />
<br />
But they are still Paladins and Paladins have a few ranged abilities and command over Holy magic, so it's not far fetched to assume that the Interrupt might be at least 10 yards and be Holy based or something. 40 yards would be stupid, but a few yards would alleviate the problem in your scenario enough for Ret Paladins to keep their weakness but also have a chance to run things around.</div></div><hr />

Quote from Blizzard staff<br />
...So we make the Resto druid or Enhance shaman version every new tier. It would be a more interesting decision if there was a crit + Intellect relic and a haste + Intellect relic, and you can choose which one to use.<br />
<br />
This is very contradictory to what I have seen other blue posts say. I thought they always said they didn't want relics/idols to be stat sticks like wands, and they liked that they changed the way you play a little by making you cast something you might not normally cast?<br />
<br />
I very much agree, the idea that my totems might become a mere stat stick just sucks. Granted to some extent that's what they are but I enjoy that there's a little mechanic to it. It also gives them the potential to be a bit more powerful than other items. Like the 264 Resto totem gives me some 260 SP after I get 3 stacks of the buff by casting Riptide. A Mage/Priest/Lock would shit their pants if they were given a wand with that much sp on it. I like the idea of there being a choice between relics in the future, but if it reduces them to just something to fill that last item slot, then relics will lose imo a large part of their appeal.</div></div><hr />

A. The original “fantasy”; behind the Mastery bonus is that you’re storing shadows through combat with you, that you can unleash out using Mind Blast or Mind Spike for more burst damage.

<br />
<br />
<br />
When I heard this quote one graphic immediately came to mind. Instead of balls/ravens/etc flying around the priest, imagine the screen just getting darker there. The more shadows you store the bigger and darker this area is. Like the priest is sucking the light out of the area.</div></div><hr />

...there is already a meta achieve in place that allows you to get a 310% speed mount and i have had one since September when it was available, so i dont know what you are bitching about really, nobody thinks they are cool on my server because of how fast the mount is, just basically which one you are riding/sporting makes your e-peen bigger...useless rant imo, and i welcome the 310% trainables, bring on more variety !!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Q. Why are Restoration druids the only spec in the game not receiving a new spell?<br />
A. Restoration druids are actually getting a fair bit. For one, Tree of Life is getting a whole new model (think Ancients of War) and will also “morph” some of your spells to do crazy things while in the form, such as cause Regrowth to be instant, or Lifebloom to apply two applications at once. Tranquility will be raid-wide. We’re also touching nearly every Restoration druid spell to make sure each has a niche and feels good. In general, playing a Restoration druid should feel a lot different (better!) in Cataclysm than it does today.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good. Here's to hoping Blizzard will actually stick to this design philosophy for Tree of Life and get through with it to launch. This sounds like just the kind of remedy our gameplay can use. Lower, but sustained - and pre-emptive - healing for most of our time; burst healing - albeit on a cooldown - readily available at the push of a button.<br />
<br />
We'll have to await the complete picture of talent tree, spell pool and the new functionality of our beloved form to give a final verdict though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's gonna be pretty cool the first few days. I mean, i thought the WOTLK release was epic, borean tundra felt like a battleground vs. NPCs. If ever you found yourself in trouble 5 people would rush to your aid. It actually felt like a war against the monsters.<br />
<br />
It's going to be really interesting to see what people do on the first few days. You have levelling from 80-85 in the new areas, exploring all of azeroth (by flying no less!) and seeing how its changed, or starting a brand new character, due to the quest revamps, new races and new race-class combinations.<br />
<br />
Cata is going to be epic.</div></div><hr />

Q: Do you intend to have all 280% flying mounts scale to 310% when a 310% mount is earned, or will only purchased mounts do so?<br />
A: Our current plan, is that in Cataclysm, you can learn a new rank of flying that lets all flying mounts move at 310% (even current 280% mounts). That will probably be as fast as mounts will ever get. We don’t like it that when you get a 310% mount that you stop using your old ones.<br />
<br />
Q: If 310% speed is becoming trainable, does that mean we'll be able to fly in Azeroth from the get-go?<br />
A: We have considered the concept of “Old Weather Flying.” Just kidding. More than likely, you’ll just be able to fly from the beginning.<br />
This ^^ is so much win!</div></div><hr />

Q: Will Ragnaros have a new weapon in Cataclysm, considering that we stole and reforged his? I'm sure he's not happy about that either.<br />

<br />
<br />
Their Raven Flock (http://www.wowhead.com/spell=50740) ability does shadow damage, and they appear as though they're in shadowform. They can also, surprisingly, cast a healing spell, but we've seen plenty of Dark Mending abilities not available to the current Shadow Priest, so I guess that's just so they don't have to make the mob shift out of their shadowform in order to cast it... Heh.<br />
<br />
And besides, the Scarlet Crusade's priests were Priests of the Holy Light, too. Yes, they got corrupted - but that's sort of what shadow priests are supposed to represent, anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Q: How will haste affect channeled spells. Will it be similar to DoTs and HoTs?<br />
A: haste already affects channeled spells mr rogue.<br />
<br />
Q: Can you make crowd control in raids and 5-mans an important aspect of the PvE game again?<br />
A: Yes we will give rogues and mages more cc which will screw up pvp balance.<br />
<br />
Q: Will relics and wands be getting any new attention in Cataclysm?<br />
A: Relics yes, wands no. We enjoy world of meleecraft more.<br />
<br />
Q. Is the game shifting more toward PvP?<br />
A: No.<br />
<br />
Q: Did the developers learn anything from the death knight release that they plan to keep in mind for any possible future classes?<br />
Yes. Mages are what death knights were at the beginning of wotlk, a class with powerful anti melee, anti cast and cc abilities is overpowered.<br />
<br />
Q: Why are you giving Mages more Crowd Control?<br />
A: Our boss Kalgan (still) plays a mage. We want mages to be a one person army who doesn’t need to be supported by other players in PvP or PvE.<br />
<br />
Q. Halp I'm a rogue!<br />
A: Cloak of Skill now provides 100% resistance so you can gank and rape casters.<br />

so i question you: why do you think wotlk instances are easy? is it the lack of CC? Have you played when wotlk came out? Do you remember the following: oculus, OK, AN, HoL, HoS, and gundrak. because as i remember all those were pretty much avoided (not to mention, oculus traumatized alot of people) and the red proto drake was actually hard to get too</div></div><hr />

&quot;So.. ravens, shadow priests?&quot; <br />

Your incredulity should be directed to more deserving targets, like people who insist on asking questions that have already been addressed, ie<br />
<br />
1. Q: Compared to some third mastery bonuses (radiance etc) others are a little boring (+crit damage etc) Intended? Comments?<br />
2. Q: Can you allow points spent in your off tree give a diminished amount of mastery bonus toward your main tree so as to not nerf hybrid specs?<br />
3. Q: When does the homogenization of classes stop? Paladins are starting to look like priests. Where is the diversity?<br />
4. Q: When you say you're going to make relics class agnostic, does it include druids' idols as well?<br />
5. Q. Why are Restoration druids the only spec in the game not receiving a new spell?<br />
6. Q: Will Protection Warriors have improved AoE tanking in Cataclysm?<br />

I still havent figured out why they didnt just give rogues mail and say screw everyone else as the change is basically just intended for them and a little bit for enhance shammies. But i have heard more talk on fixing shammies and buffing rogues than any other class. (blizz's other fav class pally gets alot of mention too.) warlocks are getting a huge change with the new soul shard mechanic which will be a huge balance issue and barely get any talk about us.

A: We want the challenge of beating PvE encounters or enemy teams in PvP to be how awesome you are at strategizing, not how often you are at recruiting the right classes. While it is very, very important to us for classes to feel different, it’s also very important to us that friends get to play together.<br />

<br />
People need to stop wining and cyring about some of the changes though. We still have ALL of beta to go though. if any nubers are unbalanced, it is very easy to change them.<br />
<br />
I dont know too much about PvP, but I know there is a LOT more balance pvp and pve wise in Wrath, and I bet it will be even better in Cata.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bro, take some time typing stuff. And it's perfectly fine to 'wining and crying' about spells, because look where sentry totem got us. Look what Regeneration got us, look what a bashed to the ground BM got us, etc, etc. How are you so sure all things will be fixed in Cata? And in THIS specific beta?</div></div><hr />

Something you could <br />
[size=1]Q: Where is my moose?<br />
A: Well, we’re looking for a zone where moose would really fit. Unfortunately we did the perfect zone for them, Grizzly Hills, already. On the other hand, let’s just say we have a large, Egyptian-themed desert zone in Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hello silithus, this is already a very egyptian themed zone, and we all remember the Opening event of Ahn'Qiraj.. not to mention the anubis looking guards in AQ40 and last boss in AQ10..<br />
<br />
Anyhow.. all of this sounds very exciting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Q. now people are better can we have hard raids again?<br />
A. Heroic mode is for you.<br />
<br />
Same heroic mode which gets nerfed after Ensidia do it. I mean now they even give players 5,10,15% buffs to get heroic content done, and its only been a month or two.. <br />
<br />
Q. Paladins are getting all the priest spells, aren't we supposed to be different<br />
A. Well, what if your friend is a paladin, but priests are better in that instance.. you need to play with your friends right?<br />
<br />
C'mon Blizz, this is the same old watered down, homogenised, everyone must be able to do everything stuff as Wotlk. I assumed from all the QQ about these things and the falling subscriber numbers that they'd realise they failed with raiding and classes in Wrath and would go back to what worked. Guess not.<br />

I would hope ,in thier infinite wisdom (and no, thats not mockery, i love blizz devs for thier hard work and concious thinking) that they reward those who ALREADY have a 310% mount by scaling the expense to fit the achievement of already earning this reward, so lets say 1K G to train if you do not currently own a 310% mount, 100G if you do. Just a suggestion, thoughts anyone?<br />

A: The heroic difficulty is designed for the players looking for more of a challenge. One of the things we learned from Icecrown is that we unlocked the heroic modes so late that players had tons of practice on the encounters on normal mode, so the step up was smaller than it was in say Ulduar when players on hard mode were still learning some of the encounter basics. (In our defense though, because of the time of year we released Icecrown we made a conscious decision to not ask players to choose between holiday events and hard-mode raiding.)<br />
<br />
Lie. The biggest problem with such stuff is that everything available on PTR, and the actual (paying) players has to test every single bit of content before it gets to live. Those people who involved in hardcore raiding _must go_ and play on PTR too if they dont want to loose experience with the upcoming content.<br />
At the end when a new content is released on live is already obsoloted because nothing new in it really.<br />
And this is sad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just proves you can't assume anything based on microscopic amounts of information.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;we're giving rogues more passive defenses&quot;..... and the ones outlined were more armor and stam on ALL gear that isn't plate... as in, pretty much any class a rogue did very good dmg too now mitigates more dmg.... this doesn't feel like a rogue adjustment so much as a game adjustment.<br />
<br />
in addition..... rogues are getting 2 (TWO) new activated defense cooldowns..... while they are trying to remove our reliance on those very same active defenses..... how does anything they are saying on this subject make ANY sense?<br />
<br />
Toning down the cooldowns so they can make their survival a little more passive doesn't mean they can't get new cooldowns. One has nothing to do with the other.<br />
<br />
And yes the armor/sta increase everyone is getting is more of a game change, but they are trying to make a point that you need to look at how these changes will work in Cataclysm, not how they would look now. The game is going to be very different and you need to put these changes in the proper context of Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
<br />
also. they didn't answer why mages needed ANOTHER &quot;control&quot; mechanic. Sure, they have alot of control and thats their niche, but really, did they need MORE shit to spam?<br />
<br />
Um, that's their job, that's the answer. Many classes are getting &quot;more shit to spam&quot; that fits their niche. The new mage one is very intersting, and that's what they are trying to do, give everyone a new, interesting mechanic within their niche.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, wtb same DR's on shatter barrier root, and Frostnova's and pet novas if rogues are getting their stuns on DR. Only fair right?<br />
<br />
<br />
You can't get angry at anything yet because you have no idea how everything will look when it's done. They very well may be putting more DR on mage stuff. We know about 5% of the changes happening in Cataclysm class wise.<br />
<br />
You have no idea what you're talking about. I'm not being mean, it's the truth. All we have are tiny tiny bits and pieces of info that are going to fit together with a huge amount of larger bits of info we don't have yet and we don't know what the outcome will be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
so if one friend wants to run end game content and the other doesnt (or is just too lazy to put in the time/effort), you will keep homogenizing classes<br />
<br />
things were great in BC before you started making things 'balanced'... classes had specific roles, function, etc. it was a matter of recruiting not just the right class, but the right people<br />

<br />
I very much agree, the idea that my totems might become a mere stat stick just sucks. Granted to some extent that's what they are but I enjoy that there's a little mechanic to it. It also gives them the potential to be a bit more powerful than other items. Like the 264 Resto totem gives me some 260 SP after I get 3 stacks of the buff by casting Riptide. A Mage/Priest/Lock would shit their pants if they were given a wand with that much sp on it. I like the idea of there being a choice between relics in the future, but if it reduces them to just something to fill that last item slot, then relics will lose imo a large part of their appeal. <br />

TBH I understand the point that working hard for raiding hardmodes/achieves and being top in arena should be rewarded (I have a 310% mount myself from ULD) but making it a trainable thing isn't a big deal and you all should have seen it coming. They are pretty much giving every 80 a free 310% mount anyways for minimal effort by means of the Violet Proto-Drake. They will prolly just make it so that if you do NOT already have a 310% mount you will have to buy the skill. If they don't, I will just ride my 310% anyways as I have been doing for months now. As far as what they will be doing with the new top achievements to replace the mounts, I just hope it isn't a title and it's something more praiseworthy. Either way, it's just a game and if you all are QQ-ing about it THAT much you should prolly take a break from the game anyways.

Have you played this game before? I love people who say what's the point of getting 310% mounts for hard modes and other achievements. The point is that for an entire expansion, you had a rare, faster mount that people that didn't get the achievement did not have. Now the expansion is ending and like every one before, the elite rewards are toned down, changed or removed and new special rewards replace them.<br />
<br />
You know this. You understand it. But you just have to complain about something.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not to mention that the mount itself will still be there. You can still feel l33t on your Bloodbathed Frostbrood Vanquisher, even if all the noobs have a 310% Bronze Drake (or whatever).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Second</div><div class="date">2010-04-18, 08:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Q: Does the Marksman mastery (Double Shot) work like the Wild Quiver talent (provide a free autoshot) or like the Lightning Overload talent (a free whatever spell you just cast)? In other words, can Double Shot fire a second Chimera Shot?<br />
<br />
A: Double Shot is a half-strength autoshot. Wild Quiver will increase the damage of the autoshot to 60-70% (or something similar). Lightning Overload (the talent) will likewise increase the magnitude of the Elemental Overload mechanic.<br />
<br />
This is definitely wrong stated by the developer, as wild quiver is suppose to “You have a 12% chance to shoot an additional shot when doing damage with your auto shot, dealing 80% weapon nature damage. Wild Quiver consumes no ammo.”<br />
<br />
This is blatantly stupid as someone with no knowledge of hunter mechanism to talk about hunter.<br />
<br />
Edit: K there might be posibility that the developer is saying that the new wild quiver will increase the damage of the autoshot to 60-70%, if thats the case, not bad... o.O<br />
-------------------- another person-------------------<br />
You must be retarded. I wouldn't normally say that, but you came off like an ass in your post. Take a second and think or at least ask a question before saying shit like that. What he said was very clear.<br />
<br />
The Double Shot proc is a 50% damage autoshot which takes the place of the Wild Quiver proc. So instead the Wild Quiver talent will increase the damage of that Double Shot proc from 50% to something like 70%, around the current Wild Quiver proc damage.<br />
<br />
Funny. I did read it same way, but having in mind lately changes to rogue/shammy autoattacks(poison) dmg (and to some extent even warrior rage generating-dmg conversion) to shift it from static dps, its very unlikely. Or we would be back to vanilla hunters : &lt;AFK&gt;randomname autoshooting boss - dont want to be there again tbh.</div></div><hr />

A: We will make sure they don’t feel gimp compared to the other 3 tanks. We’re not going to give them an ability that they can just spam endlessly to maintain AE threat. We think Thunder Clap and Shockwave already work well for that. We want you to have to manage threat, but we don’t want it to be insanely hard to manage. (You also might be doing less AE tanking in Cataclysm overall.)<br />
<br />
Better nerf AoE tanking and bring back some CC or dps with a brain (single targeting and waiting for threat).<br />
<br />
I am leveling a warrior right now and done tons of normal dungeons (level 75 now). I have no problems at all to keep agro on 5 mobs. I actually have insane threat after 5 seconds. This is probably different in heroic dungeons when dps does a lot more damage, but still. I don't really see a problem with waiting 3 seconds before dpsing, it's not game breaking.<br />
Please don't give more AoE threat, it dumbs the game down and makes it boring.</div></div><hr />

A: Our current plan, is that in Cataclysm, you can learn a new rank of flying that lets all flying mounts move at 310% (even current 280% mounts). That will probably be as fast as mounts will ever get. We don’t like it that when you get a 310% mount that you stop using your old ones.<br />
<br />
So if everyone can get 310, then maybe we can have the Naxx mounts back.<br />
<br />
Since they were removed so &quot;everyone wont get a 310 mount&quot;</div></div><hr />

Oh, I am sure there are some people who will. I am not too concerned about the antics of idiots, though (idiot being a good term for those who find it sufficiently humorous to change a letter in a name as a :read: bad joke).</div></div><hr />
