Unholy Death Knight Changes<br />
At the same time as Pestilent Pustules and Runic Corruption changes are on PTR, Unholy should also have increases to Portal to the Underworld damage, Armies of the Damned proc rate, Death Coil damage, and a small increase to all damage. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/788783-ion-dk-uh-feedback/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20752535075?page=21#417))<br />

Patch 7.1.5 Hunter Changes<br />
Still would like to know when these hotfixes are being rolled out so I can test them.<br />
These should be on PTR now.<br />
<br />
We'll look into the point about Marked Shot being lower damage per Focus than Aimed Shot. Both Marked Shot and Aimed Shot could probably do something closer to their live damage (assuming Patient Sniper/Sidewinders setup) to ensure Marked Shot is always high priority. Lower Focus cost on Marked Shot is also a possibility. Overall, the rotation should remain similar for a player who continues using Patient Sniper and Sidewinders, with the main caveat being that using Sidewinders in all situations will have more downsides than it does in 7.1.

Patch 7.1.5 Windwalker Monk Hotfixes<br />
In addition to some changes that are visible normally in the client (damage of most Windwalker abilities), a recent hotfix included one change that won't be noticeable until you try it, which is a very large increase to Xuen's damage.

I would bet on 3rd/4th Jan. People gonna cap out Artifact Knowledge and pets/mounts promotions will be over (token change most probably coming with this patch). They are uploading most data now, to have less work shortly after new year IMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah the 3rd/4th does sound more likely.<br />
In the midst of holidays blizzard wouldn't have the required resources to fix any critical issues that 7.1.5 might bring with it.<br />
And 2 weeks would be enough time for people to get used to the changes in the light of Nighthold releasing January 17th.<br />

Yeah Survival hunters are a class in high demand right now, every mythic+ group wants one, so does every Heroic and mythic raid. /s<br />
<br />
The only place Survival hunters are actually shining is in PvP.<br />
<br />
<br />
and yet for more than a decade that was perfectly fine for frost mages, why does it have to be different for other classes?</div></div><hr />

Mages were always in a good spot. Not OP and not Weak. Basically balanced. The only time where they feel OP is in duels. Survival Hunter is beyond that its stupid.</div></div><hr />

And the dumpster fire they turned prot into is making it to live? <br />

Good thing we provided all that feedback they didn't listen to. Again.<br />

Didn't get a single response to ANY concerns the warrior community has posted yet. It's like blizzard doesn't want us playing their game anymore.</div></div><hr />

If you only play the game based on the responses you get from Devs you must not play very many games at all, since I don't know many of game companies that get the Flak for not constantly talking to the rejects on the forums 24/7.</div></div><hr />

It means the patch is feature-complete and the only things that are going to be changing from here to release are numbers.<br />

I apologize if it seems like it will take more than spamming Ignore Pain to tank now.</div></div><hr />

I play plenty of games, but WoW is the only mmo, currently. The problem is the devs specifically mentioned that fury needed a rework and what do we end up with? A butchered prot spec instead.<br />
<br />
The absolute least they could have done was said &quot;sorry guys, we know we said fury needed a rework but it's going to take more time so it won't make it into 7.1.5.&quot;.<br />
<br />
But they couldn't even do that after they admitted that they didn't listen to any feedback from alpha or beta and joking played off how broken the spec is with &quot;better late than never!&quot;.<br />

Not sure if serious or not. It seems like you don't have a clue about the changes they've made to prot.</div></div><hr />

No..? Pretty sure frost mages have been the dominant mage spec in some raid tiers.</div></div><hr />

In the midst of holidays blizzard wouldn't have the required resources to fix any critical issues that 7.1.5 might bring with it.<br />
And 2 weeks would be enough time for people to get used to the changes in the light of Nighthold releasing January 17th.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit : Quite funnily the 3rd January is actually the day when people start hitting the Artifact Knowledge Cap 25. ^^<br />
<br />
yep, this one.<br />

If this patch goes live this is going to be a disaster.<br />

Seriously.<br />
<br />
Delay this patch.<br />
<br />
and also this one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What's the nerf? I haven't seen and can't seem to find atm.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brewmaster Kolee</div><div class="date">2016-12-25, 10:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was actually buffed to 30% on PTR from the 15% on live, but for tanks only they've reduced it back to 15%<br />
<br />
I guess it's a pre-existant nerf<br />
<br />
Yeah I found it finally, thx. For me, 15% every 30 seconds will still equate to roughly 20k hps. Plus they're adding haste, my best stat. Yeah, 25% would have been nicer, but I will probably still equip this for raids, along with the pally chest. <br />
<br />
For M+ I will continue to use Sephuz with the pally legs.</div></div><hr />
