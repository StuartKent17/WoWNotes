We’ve just updated our Mists of Pandaria Talent Calculator (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/mists-of-pandaria/feature/talent-calculator) to reflect many of the most recent changes and renovations currently being made to the next expansion of World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
We’d like to discuss these and other changes to talents and specializations in this thread. Here are a couple of thoughts to start with:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
For shaman and hunters, we still have a ways to go with the revamp of talents, and this latest calculator doesn’t have some of the changes that we’re currently working on.<br />
If you don’t see a favorite spell in the talent list, there is a good chance it is something you get automatically for choosing a particular spec. For example, all Fury warriors learn Raging Blow without having to choose it as a talent. All Discipline priests know Divine Aegis. Chances were almost certain that you were going to choose those anyway so we just gave them to you.<br />
If you don’t see a favorite spell or mechanic as a class ability, spec ability or talent, then there is a good chance it is becoming a glyph. Examples include Atonement (priest), Gag Order (Warrior), Rude Interruption (Warrior), and the Acts of Sacrifice Cleanse component (Paladin).<br />
<br />
<br />
Feel free to have a look at the updated calculator, and then discuss it there!<br />
<br />
<br />
Talent Calculator Update Clarifications<br />
Why did attacks using % weapon damage drop so much?<br />
We are in the process of recalculating the way damage is dealt. Individual weapon damage is going up by the same proportion in order to keep DPS at level 85 about the same. This should ensure that, at lower levels, these abilities aren’t overpowered. <br />
<br />
Why doesn’t every spec get a passive ability at level 10?<br />
Some specs no longer need them. For example, Fire mages don’t get bonus damage with Fire spells – they just have mostly Fire spells to cast. Some hybrids still need passives to differentiate their DPS, healing, and tanking trees. Furthermore, we can always add more if the need arises.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin <br />
Is this invisible haste buff still present for Protection Paladins going forward to 5.0, as the new talent tree update currently shows both CS and HoTR having 4.5 sec CDs and thus, actually in game they have a 3.0 sec cooldown -- or do they actually have a 4.5 sec cooldown? And if they have a 4.5 sec CD now, are they still linked or are they now unlinked?<br />
Crusader Strike and Hammer of the Righteous still share a cooldown, with a base of 4.5 seconds for both specs. Sanctity of Battle can lower this cooldown for Retribution. <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest<br />
Why didn’t the priest tree change?<br />
We are still in development. It is a challenge, when giving players a sneak peak at work in progress, to decide when to release what we have versus waiting to accumulate even more changes.<br />
<br />
Do Discipline priests have Prayer of Healing or not?<br />
Our current design direction is this: Holy does AE healing with Prayer of Healing, and Discipline heals with (a much more powerful than today) Holy Nova. Divine Aegis would work with Holy Nova under this model. However, please see the question above. The priest tree is still in heavy development.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight<br />
<br />
The death knight abilities Death Siphon, Soul Reaper, and Necrotic Strike cost 1 Death Rune. They are not free.<br />
The calculator is not currently displaying that cost type (properly). <br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock <br />
<br />
Archimonde’s Vengeance has a 1 minute cooldown.<br />
Grimoire of Sacrifice grants a 30% boost for 15 sec, which drops to 15% for the remaining duration.<br />
Blood Fear replaces Fear.<br />
Soul Link replaces Health Funnel.<br />
Harvest Life does not hit polymorphed targets.<br />
Demon Soul is not listed at this time, but this is just an error in the calculator. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior <br />
We are iterating a lot on tank rotations right now. We want rage (and all tank resources) to be something players actually use for mitigation, because we think that will be more fun than having a resource that gets ignored. Under this model, Protection warriors can’t have many DPS abilities that cost rage, because rage will be too valuable for Shield Block and Shield Barrier on fights where survival is a challenge. An ability with no resource cost needs some kind of cooldown or it will just be macro’ed and / or spammed, which isn’t a lot of fun.<br />
<br />
Prot warriors have a lot of abilities to manage: Shield Slam, Revenge, Devastate, Thunder Clap, Shield Block and so on, as well as several emergency buttons to handle situations such as streaming adds. We’re okay with melee specs having an occasional free GCD, as long as it doesn’t happen with frustrating regularity. <br />
<br />

<br />
From the previous version it would appear that the duration of meta is based on the amount of demonic fury you have.<br />
Though it will not have a cooldown, but whether it is based in duration on the initial amount of demonic fury or can be extended remains to be seen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you read some of the talents that say &quot;NYI&quot; or &quot;for testing purposes&quot;, you can deduce that the spells are in a testing build of some sort, possibly alpha. Therefore, a beta in a month or two isn't crazy to think of.</div></div><hr />

I think it's a great idea, but unfortunately, most of the player base does not. I have found most players want to mindlessly spam their rotations against a boss that doesn't move, or attack anything but the tank. Blizzard has way too much faith in their players.</div></div><hr />

(Actually, it's probably just a temporary thing. This new 'universal debuff' thing they're passing out? Kinda makes it hard to have the 'increased magic damage' disease in there. But they could have given us the 8% magic damage buff rather than the 4% physical damage... &lt;.&lt;)<br />

The expansion isn't even in beta. It is unlikely that much of this will remain the same by the time it goes live.<br />

Everyone making comments about their love/hate/quitting/playing again is just being silly. How could you possibly make any decision about something that you A) Haven't played and B) Is not anywhere close to final? You can't. You can, however, troll forums for the lulz.</div></div><hr />

Your logic is flawed in that Druids are the only class Blizzard has designed in such a way that they can integrate all 4 types of gameplay into a single class without hampering the playability and the common concept of the class from the mythological/classical standpoint of what the classes were known/said to be capable of.<br />
<br />
How can you expect to squeeze a 4th spec into Paladins or Shamans? Paladins have never had the background of dealing with problems (other than healing that is) at range while the Shamans were never perceived as people perceived as possible meat-shields from all the opponents on the field.</div></div><hr />

You're forgetting that all the stats will be squashed. There will no longer be 200k tanks out there. We'll have to wait and see just how much our stats are lowered, but you really can NOT think of these numbers in the context of the current game.</div></div><hr />

I doubt it. It may get announced during the MoP Press Tour, which is scheduled for March 13-15, though.</div></div><hr />

I agre about pala (well i dont imagine rPaly dps, althought we have a chance to see soemthing like shockadin in BC:)), but U are not right about shamans; since vanilia, there was an idea about shaman tank (do not forget that shamy was only available for horde); below a quote from wow wiki:<br />
<br />
&quot;Originally, shamans were supposed to be capable of tanking through the enhancement talent tree.[3] However, their lack of heavy (plate) armor and the various changes made to their talent trees over time have phased out their tanking potential in favor of healing and damage dealing. While most shamans are capable of adequately tanking instances prior to reaching level 60, higher level areas and instances require tanks to have stronger passive defenses and damage mitigation than shaman have, despite their versatility and healing abilities. &quot;<br />
[wowpedia.org, Shaman]<br />
<br />
Also u still got sets for shamans below lev 60 that grand u extra dodge and parry.<br />
<br />
btw, i wouldnt mind to get tanking subspec, like choosing two other talents in exchange for tanking surv. :)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alayea</div><div class="date">2012-02-18, 05:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In theory, having an enhance shaman capable of tanking sounds neat. Unfortunately, theory doesn't translate to reality in this case.<br />
<br />
Or maybe it is fortunate. I'd bet my guild leader would urge me to try out tanking -- which I suck at. :x</div></div><hr />
