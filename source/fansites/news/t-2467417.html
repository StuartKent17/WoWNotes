[Updated 19:30 PST – all changes below are now live]<br />
<br />
Good evening!<br />
<br />
We’ve taken a careful look at healer mana during longer PvP engagements in both Arenas and battlegrounds, and we’re deploying some changes to address several concerns.<br />
<br />
In PvP, we want mana to feel like a more critical resource, and we want mana efficiency to be an important part of PvP healing. At the beginning of Battle for Azeroth, mana regeneration from all healer specs was reduced by 15-30% (depending on the class), and after reviewing the current state of the game, we feel like further reductions are necessary to both healer specs and a few hybrid specs.<br />
<br />
With a hotfix that is coming very soon:<br />
<br />
Player versus Player<br />
<br />
Restoration Druid mana regeneration is now reduced by 55% in PvP.<br />
Holy Priest, Holy Paladin, Restoration Shaman, and Mistweaver Monk mana regeneration is now reduced by 50% in PvP.<br />
Discipline Priest mana regeneration is now reduced by 45% in PvP.<br />
Balance Druid, Feral Druid, and Elemental Shaman mana regeneration is reduced by 35% in PvP.<br />
<br />
<br />
Separately, we’re working on the following hotfix:<br />
<br />
Druid<br />
<br />
Restoration<br />
Nourish (PvP Talent) mana cost increased by 30%<br />
<br />
<br />
Separately, we’re addressing Neurotoxin.<br />
<br />
Rogue<br />
<br />
Assassination<br />
Neurotoxin now increases the cooldown of affected spells by 1 sec, down from 3 sec.<br />
Neurotoxin now has a 45 second cooldown, up from 25 sec.<br />
Neurotoxin now has a 3 sec duration, down from 10 sec.<br />
Developers note: Unfortunately, we are unable to fix a number of technical issues with this spell at this time. We’re working on a fix for it that we hope to include in 8.1.5.<br />
<br />
<br />
Again, the above changes to the game will be made live very soon. I will update this thread with each, and you’ll see the final word on all new hotfixes in our next hotfixes update (tomorrow, Feb. 14, in the afternoon PST).<br />
<br />
<br />
Raid Testing Schedule - February 21st - 25th<br />
On Thursday, February 21st we will be conducting a Heroic raid tests of Crucible of Storms. After testing has ended on Thursday, we will open the zone on Normal mode until Monday, February 25th.<br />
<br />
Thursday, February 21st<br />
The Restless Cabal - Heroic Crucible of Storms<br />
13:00 PST (16:00 EST, 22:00 CET)<br />
<br />
Uu’nat, Harrbinger of the Void - Heroic Crucible of Storms<br />
14:00 PST (17:00 EST, 23:00 CET)<br />
<br />
Normal Crucible of Storms<br />
16:00 PST (19:00 EST, 1:00 CET)<br />
<br />
As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a test environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the bosses being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br />
<br />
Q: How do I get into the raid zone?<br />
A: In Zuldazar, Boralus, Dalaran, Orgrimmar, or Stormwind, you may speak to Nexus-Lord Donjon Rade III in order to teleport into the raid zone while it is open for testing. (The option to teleport into a zone will not be available when the zone is not open for testing.)<br />
<br />

Bornakk, Still Here?<br />
I am still here my friend.<br />
<br />
Can we expect to see less replies to feedback? None at all? More?<br />
We will not be ignoring the community. That said, I don’t mean to dodge the question but I would prefer to let our actions speak for themselves as we work through these changes because ultimately you and the rest of the community are the ones who will judge just how much we are communicating and listening to you. We are here though. (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1105014-bornakk-still-here/) / Official Forums (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/100277/19))</div></div><hr />

<br />
The thing is that neurotoxine don't stop you from using other spells, just from spaming 1 of them over and over... And that should be &quot;unfair&quot; to new players lmao. Anyways it had a bug that if you kicked while on neurotoxine it increased the lockout or something like that and they could not fix it... btw neurotoxine is dispeleable cause it's a poison lmao it would be funny if it silenced on dispel like vampiric touch or unstable affliction xd.<br />
I wish they just put something like &quot;the old mind numbling&quot; in the way neurotoxine was implemented (like mid CD low duration -% haste on demand poison).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Druid is best in long dampening games - and they are clearly trying to cut these games and this means a bigger nerf to druid.</div></div><hr />

People at Blizzard wasn't &quot;responsible&quot; for it. This was all Activision. They want more money, so they fired the non-essential people from Blizzard. People don't get it. Blizzard retains &quot;creative control&quot; over their games. But anything that's a money grab is all Activision wanting to see more profits. They tell Blizzard to make more money, now we see a new shop mount every month, among other things.</div></div><hr />

Who's the parasite? &quot;Someone has a different opinion than mine&quot; *throws temper tantrum* time to go outside and get some fresh air bro. Yikes.<br />
Personally i agree with him. Most devs are super passionate about the game(s) they work on. Its basically their kid in a sense. It's also hard to convey that through text, especially if the person reading it is already angry/frustrated/trolling and not likely to agree no matter what is said to begin with. ^^<br />
I bet most people who have been to blizzcon, e3, pax etc and talked/interviewed a dev in the past know exactly what im talking about. If you listened to him on twitch last night with any attitude other than the &quot;I hate blizzard, i don't care what anyone says&quot; attitude, obviously that passion extends to CM's as well.</div></div><hr />

How can you justify them firing people for doing an excellent job and then &quot;Oh you're not useful for our company even though you clearly were&quot; and drop them? 3 guesses you're a baby boomer? Or do you just not give a fuck about people unless they're the rich fat cats dangling scraps for the rest of us? <br />

I wish it because they have ruined the company that many of us enjoyed and loved over the years; tarnished it with their terrible decisions and drove it to the ground.

You're at the point where you are wishing that people die horribly over this. WoW is just a game and Blizzard is just a company, not your life. (and if you do consider it to be your entire life, then yes, Please seek help as that level of obsession is not healthy) What they did is pretty shitty, yes, (especially due to the timing) but not something to wish the deaths of people over.</div></div><hr />

If you are a publically traded company, there is only so many things you can refuse without being eventually just replaced, especially if its about saving money - in fact you have a responsibility to the share holders to make them as much money as you can.

I wish it because they have ruined the company that many of us enjoyed and loved over the years; tarnished it with their terrible decisions and drove it to the ground. You had Blizzard Employees crying in the parking lots because they were not sure who was even going to lose their job.

It does beg the question what they're thinking here, when their investor call is all about doing things for players, and then they pretty much destroy an important aspect of that relationship. That's why I can't just go &quot;rah rah, everything is awesome now&quot;, because they have to DO what they were talking about doing on the call - make better games. <br />
<br />
And, as usual, it's radio silence from the actual Blizzard people who still have a job. People like Ion and Kaplan need to be out in front of this assuring people that everything is going to improve because of these cuts. One PR release statement from Brack ain't gonna cut it. They kicked the anthill over for ALL of their communities here, and set the remains on fire doing squat to reach out and calm people down - which as usual will lead to more unbridled accusations, rumors, and conspiracy theories. <br />
<br />
It's a bit eyebrow raising that several people, like Bellular, have said their usual contacts within the company, people who's job it was to manage that kind of contact, are gone. The only thing I can think is they're going bunker mode - which has worked so well for them, in the past.</div></div><hr />

You can't live without a heart. If you're a heartless person, exactly how are you alive? It's psychotic that you casually agree that the lives of hundreds of people is worth less than the lives of one or two people. Lemme guess, were the detainment camps and removal of all the children from families justified or is it fair to be upset (even to the point of wanting to retaliate) against Trump and ilk for causing such harm upon the thousands of families involved? Or is that just &quot;justified&quot; to you as well, and it's &quot;psychotic&quot; to wish harm upon those who actively ripped children from their mothers? <br />
<br />
If you have record profits, why do you need to then turn around and fire people? Are you that obtuse that you don't see what's happening yet again in modern America? Richer needs to get rich, so let's fuck over the poor. It doesn't matter if they need insurance or money, or if they did a damn good job. We need to get rid of them to appease the people at the top and give them even more money. <br />

Fair point. <br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong I understand that, but at a certain point trying to make the excuse that &quot;you're just doing your job&quot; doesn't cut it. You know who is able to take cuts without being affected? The top people making millions, hand over fist, without putting in the effort that all the developers, CMs and people that actually interact with the customers do every single day. <br />
<br />
There is nobody that can justifiably be considered that much (Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, etc). Just recently we had Insulin shoot up 600% in price without any regard to the lives of millions affected, all because some CEO wanted to make more money. Sure he eventually got arrested on other charges, but how is that legal to begin with? At what point does manipulating and extorting the majority go from &quot;its just business&quot; to &quot;that should not be tolerated&quot;?</div></div><hr />

There are almost a dozen NA CMs yet people think Ythisens was the only one because they can't wrap their tiny minds around more than blue text. The worse ones are the rabid keyboard warriors blaming CMs for lack of blue text in threads their opinions have placed importance on, like the one idiot in this very thread and the other idiot that actually posted a death threat. Community engagement is more than the precious blue text in which you want to see your main's buffs, you greedy fucks.<br />
<br />
They aren't developers and they can't read the minds of the Blizzard employees responsible for the game, so they can only post what is given to them. Empty blue posts are worse than no posts at all. Does anyone actually understand how oversaturated a blue feed would be with a ton of &quot;we'll look into this&quot; or &quot;we have nothing to say&quot; replies clogging it up? Actual blue posts would be buried. But noooo, let's act like children and bitch and whine that we aren't being heard.

How is he responsible? He isn't the one deciding what information is given out to players, so it's not his fault the communication is bad.<br />

You really think he was sitting on information he wasn't sharing beause he is that bad at his (former) job?<br />
When there is information to be shared, it is shared. The problem is that very little is shared, so there's nothing to report on - and that is the problem.<br />

<br />
Blizzcon will still go on, but we've already seen the cutbacks, with the lack of a headlining band. I think those days are over, and 2019's will be scaled back, in some areas. <br />
<br />
Listen to the shareholder's call. It sounds like they're redoing their entire marketing program, and that could impact the CM team, with new people taking their place as gatekeepers between the company and the general public, journalists, and events. CMs did a lot of work in those areas. <br />
<br />
Keep in mind, the layoffs aren't the only changes happening. It's a restructuring, so job duties are being changed, departments being deployed in different directions, etc. <br />
<br />
They have a long ways to go to prove to the public, investors, and the media that these changes will work out better, long term. And I'm skeptical. Restructures can take years to settle down from the changes...or ever.</div></div><hr />

Message from J. Allen Brack<br />
&quot;To assist with the transition, we are offering each impacted employee a severance package that includes additional pay, benefits continuation, and career and recruiting support to help them find their next opportunity. These people are members of the Blizzard family—they’ve cared deeply and contributed greatly to our work here and we are extremely grateful for all they’ve done.&quot;<br />
<br />
While it sucks, layoffs in a publicly traded company happen. Blizz was actually pretty generous, compared to many companies, in that they didn't just fire the people, they gave them severance pay, will continue to provide them with insurance and other benefits, and are actively helping them find new jobs. Though, based on your posts, I'm sure you don't believe any of that.</div></div><hr />

That information has been publicly available and news'd as each person left (either to other games, other departments, or other companies). Over the last few years, the WoW CM team alone has lost Zarhym, Bashiok, Crithto, Daxxarri, Rygarius, and Ythisens. Right now, Bornakk and Lore are the only confirmed remaining (although Nethaera might still be there; we just haven't heard from her in awhile). One can argue that WoW with its current playerbase doesn't need a CM department of ten plus people, but effect of each of them leaving has been noticeable in both subtle and overt ways, and I can't imagine any of those functions will be improved by having less people covering all those tasks.<br />
<br />
That list of things I shared is accurate as far as the things CMs were in charge of, but that doesn't mean none of them will happen now. Some of it might cease to happen, some of it might be shifted to other people or the PR department, and the rest might be carried by the remaining few CMs. I agree it is unlikely that Blizzcon is going to be cancelled, for example, but that doesn't diminish the amount of coordination for it that was done by those in the community departments. <br />
<br />
My point was simply that people who read or use fansites and other third party news pages or apps should care about losing CMs for their games since those CMs are responsible for a lot of things that impact those sites and their user experience in general, and that saying all they were responsible for is forum posts is flat-out inaccurate. Sure, if your only relationship with a given game exists while you're actually playing it then probably you wouldn't care, but that obviously doesn't apply to anyone who is reading news on MMO-C.</div></div><hr />

How can a grown man be taken seriously when he's talking about how he's &quot;trending&quot; on &quot;twitter&quot;. Fuck all CMs, corrupt useless son of bitches paid to do nothing. Go post in the I like pie thread whilst 50 actually usefull threads requires acknowledgment and feedback.<br />
<br />
Go get a real job you fucking parasite.<br />
<br />
Exactly this. Paid to create the illusion that the team is listening, and avoiding real threads on important topics, and responds to a pie thread. His peak performance is how he ranked on twitter.. jeez, so glad they are getting rid of non-essential staff, and hiring real people that do the heavy lifting. <br />
<br />
Maybe now they can pour some quality into this game again, and I'm still hoping BFA is just a filler expansion like WoD was.</div></div><hr />

They'll only need to send a txt message to everyone's phone next time. Doubt there will be much for PC gamers anyways....</div></div><hr />

Ouch my feelings, i never knew words from an NPC could hurt. Oh wait, they can't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it could partly be because of the CM thing, but mostly because Activision is cutting back &quot;non essential assets&quot; to save money. While I would dearly love to go to a Blizzcon at least once, lets face facts Blizzcon is not essential to their core business. They could easily do a massive online presentation from one of their offices. Only the fan experience would be gone. <br />
<br />
Blizzard employees would miss the event and the fans (except maybe the &quot;don't you have a phone Diablo guy&quot;) but Activison, they wouldn't give a s***.</div></div><hr />
