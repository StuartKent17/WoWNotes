We’ll be performing our first stress test for WoW Classic on Wednesday, May 22, from 4–6pm PDT. During this time, the closed beta test realm will be unavailable. Those who are currently in the beta test will only be able to login to the stress test realm during this time and beta testers can participate using their existing installation. We’ll also be adding a significant number of players to the stress test from the pool of people who have already opted in for the beta but have not yet been selected.<br />
<br />
Since the same client is used for both our stress test users and our normal beta users, the name in the Battle.net App has changed to “Beta &amp; Stress Test: WoW Classic. ” If you’ve been selected to participate in the stress test, you’ll see this option appear in the Region/Account drop down menu so you can download and install the WoW Classic client in advance, but you’ll only be able to see the stress test realm when it becomes available.<br />
<br />
For the stress test, all races and classes will be available for creation, but the maximum level will be set to 5. The test will also take place on a PvP realm, but since the starting areas are sanctuaries you don’t need to worry about attacks from the other faction if you just want to level up to 5. We expect to put a lot of people in the starting zones, though, and we’re looking forward to seeing what you all do as we test the servers under crowded conditions.<br />
<br />
We’ll be actively monitoring the server, sending server messages, etc. during the 4-6pm PDT period and it’s important to have as many people as possible log in during this window! The stress test realm itself will be available until Thursday, May 23 (becoming unavailable around 6:00pm PDT).<br />
<br />
If you encounter any issues during the test, you can submit them through the bug reporting tool in-game (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/ptr-bug-report-update/152329). If there are any aspects you’d like to discuss, feel free to post in the Classic Discussion forum (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/c/community/classic-discussion).<br />
<br />
Performing tests like these are very important in contributing to a smooth launch on August 27 and we appreciate your support.<br />

WoW Classic “Not A Bug” List Additions<br />
I’ve added this to the OP:<br />
<br />
You are unable to Polymorph enemy targets that are tapped by players with whom you are not grouped. (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1105647-wow-classic-not-a-bug-list/) / Official Forums (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/175887/13))<br />
At all levels of player characters and enemies, aggro radius is set to the intended distance. (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1105647-wow-classic-not-a-bug-list/) / Official Forums (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/175887/14))<br />

Pretty sure they are saying the &quot;opposit&quot; in this case.<br />
A lot of people watching streamers have said they feel like the aggro radius is too small, not too big.<br />

seeing how you can work and get paid as a tester for all sort of shit, including games, which include stress testing. Doing so for blizzard in this game is sorta kinda unpaid work. But don't focus to much on that part. My point was that they should let the people stay in the beta after, regardless. As a thank you for helping stress test</div></div><hr />

<br />
You could argue every thing is unpaid work by that logic as you can get paid for literally any thing. <br />
<br />
And if they left people who stress tested stay in the beta it would make the beta useless as literally every one would get in.</div></div><hr />

Oh you'll have something to do in those 2hrs m8, trying to hit lvl 5 with way too many people competing for mobs. That's the whole point, overcrowding the starter zone to test stability.</div></div><hr />

What else is there to test in a STRESS test? The login servers and how the server behaves on high load (aka with lots of players at the same place -&gt; lvl 5 cap)</div></div><hr />

Its to make sure people don't run off from starting zone. They want to see how many people can one zone handle. If people are all over Azeroth, test becomes meaningless.</div></div><hr />

its going to be tough to even level to 5 with how many people will be there. that is the whole point and the blue post even mentions this. Remember, you have to Tag a mob to &quot;win it&quot; its not like live where everyone can hit the mob and get credit.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard said themselves that they will prioritize accounts who have been created during vanilla release.<br />
Obviously it makes sense for them, since those people know what the game was like back then and can report bugs unlike those who never played vanilla and just want in on the beta.</div></div><hr />

It was a surprisingly fast download. After about 5 seconds of downloading it was in Playable status. And this is just over a standard Spectrum cable connection</div></div><hr />

I'll admit, this is something I wasn't aware of. Is this strictly to Polymorph or would it count for other things as well (Repentance)?<br />
<br />
I'm reasoning it's only polymorph because it causes the target to rapidly heal and could be used for trolling purposes. Heal a mob you didn't tag so it kills the player(s) fighting it so you can tag it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Low Hanging Fruit</div><div class="date">2019-05-21, 11:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Several things are going to happen which the test is likely mostly about. <br />
<br />
1. Log in servers being pounded, character creation getting pounded, zoning into the starting zone pounded. Good testing.<br />
<br />
2. As people zone in layering will be tested to make sure it is working as Blizzard intends it to. Good testing.<br />
<br />
After that odds are its just going to be a tag fest with 100s of people going after single mobs. People will get enraged. We will have a ton of entertaining posts to laugh about because of it. Not many people will actually be leveling that effectively during the 2 hour period. Maybe in the following days people will hit 5, but... ummm.. have fun I guess.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorgodeus</div><div class="date">2019-05-21, 11:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So the stress test is actually a &quot;beta&quot; version, or lesser version of the actual beta? In the sense that if you get invited to stress test you can't continue in the actual beta afterwards?<br />
<br />
Also level 5 cap? Come on now.. They must be testing the layering tech above everything else it seems.<br />
<br />
The level 5 cap is to keep everyone in the same general areas. Otherwise, it would not be much of a stress test. It is also only for 2 hours, so no reason to worry about higher levels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you log in now and only see a grayed out &quot;Stress Test&quot; realm. Then you only have access for the stress test, but are part of the larger beta pool. Meaning most likely at some point you'll be selected in a future wave. <br />
<br />
From what I understand you will have access to the stress test realm from 1 AM local time, basically for 24 hours until they shut it down on Thursday. They will only be monitoring it from 1am - 3am however.</div></div><hr />

I don't see it, but I may just not have been chosen. If they haven't yet, seems like they're not giving people much time beforehand to download it. It's not like WoW is a tiny game, and people work and stuff and won't be able to download during the day tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Took me a whopping 4 minutes or so to d/l and install. It is only ~5 GB.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you are reading way to much into it. I simply meant that when people are invited to stress test something, they could have been able to keep playing after, they could have plopped up a few more beta servers. More people testing = Less bugs, it benefits everyone.</div></div><hr />

I am betting all the stress testers will be the next to get full beta invites though, it only makes sense.</div></div><hr />

Account from Nov 24, 2010 and unsubscribed a few months in WoD. Got access for the test stress.<br />
<br />
<br />
Really, I would think there should be plenty of room for all the accounts created during vanilla that are still subbed since that can't be too many people, right? Or maybe we waaaaay underestimate that number somehow?. Anyway I'm sorry for you, hope you can get in soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, can't be that many; but they also seem not to give out too many invitations; I've been watching classic streams and the servers are not really that populated yet.<br />
<br />
Did get an invite now too, but the stress test invites don't work beyond the 2-day test on the level 5 realm, as I read in a blue response. So not too hyped. :(^^</div></div><hr />

I beta tested WoD, Legion and alpha tested BfA. Never did I think wowa.. theres too many people here. Although streamers &quot;press&quot; may have thought so.</div></div><hr />

They wan't as much players as possible -&gt; give them something to do.<br />
<br />
Oh, trust me. 5 lvls in WoW Classic are more than enough. Most people probably past the time trying to complete the kobold quest on Elwynn, or just looking for the class trainer or whatever. Just the few veterans would reach lvl 5 fast enough, and then we only need to create another char to test classes/races. It's enough for a stress test that will give them logs to see if servers are big enough for starter zones in August launch.</div></div><hr />
