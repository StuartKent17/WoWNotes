Tabard of the Argent Dawn<br />
Beloved though it is, there are no current plans to reintroduce the Tabard of the Argent Dawn. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26137026190/tabard-of-the-argent-dawn/))<br />
<br />
Naxxramas in Cataclysm<br />
We intend to keep Naxxramas hovering over its current home of Dragonblight. Moving the citadel back to the Plaguelands doesn't really fit in with our plans for evolving the story in that area for Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
[...] If we're going to develop content where you travel in the past to take part in some major piece of Warcraft history, we're going to try and make that content compelling and enhance the story of the expansion. Adding a level 60 version of Naxxramas to Caverns of Time doesn't sound very compelling or relevant to Cataclysm... &quot;Patch 4.1: Travel back in time to return to a high-end raid not applicable or relevant to the current end game, characters, or storyline!&quot; ;) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26137476303/lore-out-the-window-bring-back-60-naxx/))<br />
<br />
Past/Present Azeroth Phasing<br />
We're not phasing the entire old world into a past/present sort of scenario. The Cataclysm will bring about inescapable change for all inhabitants of Azeroth. We don't plan to phase a portion of the playerbase into some past world of Azeroth where environments, quests, and creatures are unchanged. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26137476303/lore-out-the-window-bring-back-60-naxx/))<br />
<br />
Effective Health in Cataclysm<br />
I'm not sure that serious tanks will ever gem dodge or parry at the expense of Stamina to any great degree. As long as dragons breathe, there will be elements of encounters where health is more useful than avoidance.<br />
<br />
However, I think avoidance overall will still be more valuable in Cataclysm than it is on Live today when your healers risk running out of mana. The theoretical tank with a huge health pool and 0% avoidance should feel like a liability instead of the holy grail it is viewed as today.<br />
<br />
We're trying to shake [some] tanks out of the mentality that something is garbage unless it improves health or armor. That's not the same as saying that tanks will value dodge and parry and view health and armor as garbage instead. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25968753168/eh-for-cata/))<br />
<br />
So it's the dragons' fault. Why can't you give us something we can stack and get on gear which will reduce magical damage taken? Perhaps a &quot;mitigation rating&quot; which will reduce all damage taken, like resilience does in PvP, though at a rate less than armor or avoidance reduces physical damage.<br />
Couple of reasons. One, every boss (well, with a couple of weird exceptions) does physical damage, but there are plenty of bosses that do only physical damage. Second, we want the dragon breathing to be a scary moment that requires you and the healers to consider using your cooldowns. I realize the strategy of a tank is to try and do whatever you can to make those moments not scary, but as soon as you accomplish that, then the fights become a lot less exciting. Roller coasters that move slowly might feel more safe, but they're not as much fun. We have to nail that sometimes narrow line between letting you prepare for a fight without minimizing the danger (assuming its appropriate for your level of progression, etc.) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25968753168/eh-for-cata/))</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://www.wowwiki.com/Tabard_of_the_Protector looked a bit like argent dawn but with the AoE thing :)<br />
<br />
something i kept on my knight champion, which was once an alt ... but when i deleted my mains, i kept him.. he had nothing, he did the dark portal event naked. No longer on darkspear EU, where he was the first knight champion (until that uni .. exam thing kicked in)<br />
<br />
Good times, can't believe their bringing back the ranks as arena ****. If you wanna do that play Guild Wars, great spectator mode there. sigh. E-sports my ass. <br />
<br />
glad the story and world are both moving forward, yes the old stuff was nice and change is hard but we survived with the **** alterac valley changes. From getting rid of the PvE goodies, to changing it into a quickie game. Gone are the days of Ivus and co via summoning, gaining calvary.. you know &quot;having fun&quot;. but we survived that. i miss old old AV<br />

Why is it only hardcores are allowed to complain? I'm not hardcore, I still think it's silly.<br />
<br />
At least now it's all out, we can review it. All in all, I'd say it worked averagely, I see no reason to reimplement it in future raids. It did help the players with less skill/time to see most of the normal content, but it also hurt the pug and hardcore raid scenes. Mixed bag really, C- from me.</div></div><hr />

I don't bitch about lvl 80s being able to wtfpwn lvl 70 and 60 raid content. I don't bitch about lvl 55s going back into scarlet monestary and clearing it solo. No reason to bitch about ICC since it is old content.<br />
<br />
I got your point but don´t forget that icc gear is still usefull / top nowadays, and thats not the case for &quot;old&quot; content gear.<br />
But I enjoy clearing icc 25ger with my alt 11/12 hc in ~3h ^^ with an guild extern grp :)</div></div><hr />

That also means that GS requirements will go up to 5.6k min for 10 man and 6k min for 25 man on frostmane eu cause thats the type of retarded server im on, time for a move i think.<br />
<br />
Haha, I cleared 6/12 25man on my 4,8k GS, green gemmed moonkin and didn't have to link achievement from other characters :)<br />

<br />
Why should it go up in GS cause of 5% more dmg? :O thought that this means that they can lower the GS req for enterning cuase of that buff.. and TBH, there was alot of guild going well with the first buff that came for ICC10/25! anyway, i hope that more guilds get 10/25 completed faster/easier now!<br />

<br />
At least now it's all out, we can review it. All in all, I'd say it worked averagely, I see no reason to reimplement it in future raids. It did help the players with less skill/time to see most of the normal content, but it also hurt the pug and hardcore raid scenes. Mixed bag really, C- from me.<br />
<br />
please explain what it is exactly that hurts pugs and hardcore raiders?? im baffled, and dont say ahh because the baddies get free loot because that excuse is fucking retarded. <br />
The lich king and all its loot will be worth jack shit in a couple of months or whenever cata arrives so whats the problem, all these people pissing and moaning about a dungeon that will be forgotten like all the rest. Fuck i bet icc becomes a weekly raid quest to come cata. :S<br />

exactly.....why? thats just the way these pricks seem to work with this GS bllshit. Hopefully blizz will block that add on for good in the future then we will see the real skill or lack of it in people again just like it was before.</div></div><hr />

Here is the thing NO ONE seems to understand...<br />
<br />
you aren't being compared to the instance, you are being compared with all the players on your server.<br />
<br />
You don't need that high GS to clear icc10, but at this point everyone has the high gearscore. Once you hit 80 you can be at 5.3k within 20 hours played if you try.</div></div><hr />

I don't think that you understand that people want you to have like 5.5k... for 10 man...non heroic.</div></div><hr />

Really, though, you shouldn't be even near the last raid of an expansion with that quality of gear.</div></div><hr />

It's my warrior, isn't it? :P<br />

I don't plan on having her be a raiding toon. I enjoyed playing the class while leveling, but then the feeling passed once she hit 80 pre-Ulduar. I promised myself to have every 80 toon have 4-pc t9 several months ago, though. Welcome to the masochism that is being an altoholic. *lol*</div></div><hr />
