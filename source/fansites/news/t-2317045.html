World of Warcraft BlizzCon Gear Store Merchandise<br />
The Blizzard Gear store (https://gear.blizzard.com/us/blizzcon?product_list_limit=all&amp;product_list_dir=asc) has been updated with new BlizzCon 2017 products. Orders are only open to Virtual Ticket holders today, but will open for everyone on 10/17. We've highlighted some of the more interesting items below, but you can see them all here (https://gear.blizzard.com/us/blizzcon?product_list_limit=all&amp;product_list_dir=asc).<br />

World of Warcraft Sargeras Shirt<br />
The shirt description (https://gear.blizzard.com/us/blizzcon/world-of-warcraft-sargeras-shirt-men-s) potentially explains the wound added to a map in Patch 7.3.2. Check out the shirt description for spoilers!<br />

<br />
World of Warcraft Raptor Plushie<br />
This raptor (https://gear.blizzard.com/us/blizzcon/world-of-warcraft-raptor-plushie) doesn't spoil anything in its description, but an interesting raptor mount was recently added in Patch 7.3.2. The ArmoredRaptor mount is still encrypted, so we don't know what it will look like. A new creature was also added that uses hoofprints and existing horse sounds in Patch 7.3.2, but the model is encrypted with the same key as the ArmoredRaptor. You can also pick up a Elekk plushie (https://gear.blizzard.com/us/blizzcon/world-of-warcraft-elekk-plushie)! <br />

<br />
<br />
Pirate Plush Pepe<br />
This new Pepe (https://gear.blizzard.com/us/blizzcon/pirate-pepe-plush) features a pirate hate and eye patch, matching the Pirate Pepe (http://www.wowdb.com/objects/243280-pirate-pepe#model-viewer) you can see in game. He is part of the I Found Pepe! (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/10053-i-found-pepe) achievement!<br />

<br />
Kul Tiras Armor Sets<br />
These are not for sale, but with BlizzCon approaching now is a good time to post a reminder about these sets that were added in Patch 7.3. <br />

<br />
I come to this website to get news about system changes and updates to the game. I have grown used to potential spoilers being on this site but they are flagged in advance and I successfully avoided it.<br />
<br />
Why would you do this? Why is your link an image containing the actual outcome of Legion? How is that fair? This is the equivalent of posting 'DON'T READ THIS' in sixty point neon flashing font on the front page.<br />
<br />
I'm a bit pissed off at this sloppiness. <br />
<br />
Fine, I'm spoiled. Can't take that back. Can you modify the image so that as few people as possible are spoiled after me?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Before he could be taken by the remaining titans, Sargeras, the unholy leader of the Burning Legion, plunged his sword into the depths of Azeroth. Immortalize his reign with this new BlizzCon shirt!</div></div><hr />
