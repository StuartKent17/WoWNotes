<br />
That said, below around where the mouth would be it curves down and then vertically down...exactly as it does on the mouthguard of the Lich King helm. There is no way that isn't the Lich King's helm. If it turns out to be something else, I will stand by my point that they used the Lich King helm to misdirect and it wasn't really another pic: basically cheating. I agree, however, that the textures on it do not add up.<br />
<br />
So...I guess wait? There's like 3 different things to indicate 3 different franchises.</div></div><hr />

The placement's off. Also, read my statement about the mouthguard. It is there. That's distinctly a helmet.</div></div><hr />

Look at the texture below the eyes... looks awfully familiar doesn't it?<br />
<br />
Let's not be biased or anything MMO Champion... just because you want it to be Diablo 3 doesn't mean it is... show us the proof or it's all speculation... and news sites shouldn't speculate.<br />
<br />
My guess... it's Zeratul, he was always looking for Xel'Naga artifacts. The runes around the outside look like Ara'dar, the Xel'naga language...<br />
<br />
The glowing obviously means that Zeratul activated the artifact.<br />
<br />
Probably a SC game, not SC2 and not SC:Ghost.</div></div><hr />

Look at his helm... it doesn't have a diamond, the bridge across the nose is flat not sharp. The bridge on the splash page is pointed... it's not him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, it looks like the helm of the Lich King. Look. It curves down and straight. It IS the mouth guard.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let's not be biased or anything MMO Champion... just because you want it to be Diablo 3 doesn't mean it is... show us the proof or it's all speculation... and news sites shouldn't speculate.<br />
<br />
<br />
So it's ok for you to be biased about it then? Nothing here is Starcraft-esque anymore.<br />

i decided to pull this up on my 52 inch monitor and zoom in to see what i could see and that object in the right is NOT a pillar AT ALL. it clearly makes a curved cone-shape off towards the right and if you look at my very very rough sketch in, it would actually make sense to be a horn. does this mean D3? imo probably not and its probably just a little thing they are doing to hype us up. <br />
<br />
if you still dont believe me, download the image from blizz yourself and zoom in to see it is not a tower. <br />
<br />
also, if you look at the texture on it it matches that of the texture above the eyes. infer what you will. just adding in my opinion.<br />

It STILL can be anything. I'll say that my first reaction when I saw today's update was &quot;hey, that looks like the new interpretation of the Protoss, and that little artifact in the lower right of the opening looks like a metal clasp around one of their bits of &quot;hair.&quot;<br />

Diablo... perhaps. If he's got ram-like horn, the pointy thingie to the right could be the tip for a curled horn. <br />

Okay, just take a quick look at Arthas helmet, on the forhead where the eyes meet, it's a horisontal edge on the helmet, on the splash picture it's pointy, can't see how that &quot;fit&quot;, not saying that it IS diablo, but it sure as hell does not fit with with Arthas</div></div><hr />

maybe its an image they made compiling different things from all three games. a creature with protoss skin, diablo horns, and the lich king's eyes. that would be cool.</div></div><hr />

No, my argument is that would be retarded. Yes, is looks like Arthas. That is what they WANT you to think. Why in the hell would they make it him then? Come on, think a little.</div></div><hr />

&quot;That's what they want you to think&quot; just makes you look like a tinfoil hat wearing douchebag.<br />
<br />
If it turns out to be something other than Arthas, I stand by the fact that they literally &quot;cheated&quot; by using the Lich King helm in this picture and then later altering it to be something else. The mouth guard makes it clear that it is the Lich King's helmet. Period. No questions.</div></div><hr />

Hello Strawman. <br />

You've nothing to actually add besides &quot;too obvious?&quot; Because many obvious things show enough. Starcraft 2's announcement was paired with a futuristic looking timeline, ffs.</div></div><hr />

Whoever has doubts.. Do you not see the crystal on both images... if not, then look closer<br />
<br />
<br />
Sure don't. Even blown up. If the crystal is to fit in the new image, it would have to be a different shape/size.</div></div><hr />

Could be, but it seems to me that's pretty close to his head to be the spike that goes straight up. I dunno, maybe the stance/pose he's in, if it's Arthas at all /shrug</div></div><hr />

For those who still think it's Arthas. IT'S NOT. I still hope for release news, but the big news aren't about wotlk. This isn't the lich king helm, and I've made a picture why not, it's nothing like it.<br />
<br />
And don't forget, when entering tristarm we needed to touch 5 runes in a pentagram and then they lit up, just like now.<br />
We have both diablo and evil penguin holding 3 fingers (though penguin doesn't have fingers).<br />
We have someone lost in last game (Tyrael) and many refferences to the Lost series (Lost numbers, project Hydross). <br />
Diablo is prime evil, and thus can't be fully only with weapons destroyed, we destroyed only Mephisto shattering his soulstone, but we haven't finished Baal or Diablo yet.<br />
The picture references mostly diabo, becouse Protoss skin isnt like the one in picture, and it's not Arthas.<br />
We had interview with one of Blizzard and he didn't wanted to give out too much information about the game announcement.<br />
We have diablo anniversary.<br />

You bring up some good points, but don't forget that Zeratul was also lost. <br />
<br />
To be honest, I dont think the penguin has ANYTHING to do with it, I think they are just fucking with us.<br />
<br />
The runes are in a pentagram style shape, but they also look like the Xel'Naga language.<br />
<br />
The thing in the background could be anything from armor, a city in the background, a finger/horn, or something completely different.<br />
<br />
The winky face is probably just something they did to mess with us, has nothing to do with the game.<br />
<br />
It's true that Blizzard doesn't make much noise about betas and alphas and shit, so it COULD be diablo but it just doesn't look like it. My guess is on a SC game similar to SC Ghost only with protoss.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />

<br />
Look towards the bottom before it's completely engulfed by darkness. Around where a mouth would be, it curves identical to the Lich King helm. The way it pops up and off in addition to this around this area implies basic geometry of a helmet. The way the mouth area is is identical to the Lich King, irrespective of minute details like the texture, or even the freaking jewel at the top which can vary entirely according to artist or perspective/size changes.</div></div><hr />

I stand by my earlier statement: if it turns out to not be Arthas, they completely cheated by using a modded image of Arthas here to mislead rather than actually obscure what's hidden. <br />
<br />
The eyes and lower face are Arthas. Period. I don't care about the top of the helm, the fadedness and art and positioning makes it too difficult to call on.</div></div><hr />

Announcing a sequel on an anniversary is nothing new. And for all we know it will be released on June 29, 2009 or 2010.<br />
<br />
It's just something to ponder, that's what this topic is about. You guys are douches insulting each other and acting all immature. Let's get back to detective work and stop the QQ.<br />
<br />
Does no one else find it odd the runes aren't glowing fully and each rune glows in a particular pattern/spot? I can't conclude anything from it but why do that? It's much easier to render them in full glow than segment it.</div></div><hr />

Arthas died in the frozen throne. He was able to be resurrected by a Protoss, but in an epic battle between Arthas &amp; The Protoss, they slayed each other. Upon arriving in hell, Arthas met up with diablo. Diablo was willing to grant Arthas life, but in return Arthas would be part demon. Arthas arrived back on earth, but unbeknownst to him, The partial demon was actually Diablo himself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, I'm going to wave the noob flag and ask it: where are you seeing the lower face? I'm seeing glowing eyes, an angry-looking-demon-skinned brow, and some demon-skinned cheek bones. Or are the cheek bones the lower face? *confused*</div></div><hr />

I can. As I said earlier, the eyes look more white hot than the icy blue that the lich king has.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, the eyes were the first thing that swayed me away from WotLK news. They didn't look the same as all the other Lich King pictures I'd seen.<br />
<br />
But maybe we're looking at different Lich King pictures :)</div></div><hr />

The bottom of the helmet is there. It curves inward and then straight down, just as the weird vertical opening in the Lich King helmet is.<br />
<br />
The eyes, and bottom, are the Lich King's helmet. I don't give a hell about the top, given most of it is too obscured and can be an alternate texture depending on the lighting, and I don't care about the curves of the &quot;eyebrows&quot; because the differences are painfully minor, but what I do know is the shape.</div></div><hr />

&quot;The queue was visible from round the block and up the hill of the convention centre. But thankfully, as press, we were able to sail past it. Our relief was short-lived as we arrived at the press queue only to find a network failure had brought the whole press pass process to a grinding halt. After half hour we were in possession of the all-important access-all-areas golden ticket. We were handed our goodie bag which puts all previous feebies to shame. No flimsy carrier bag but a robust black holdall containing<br />
<br />
* A bound autograph book with Diablo on the front cover.<br />
* World of Warcraft Trading Card Game<br />
* WoW miniatures Game<br />
* Bonus cards from the WoW Trading Card Game<br />
* Glossy programme<br />
* Extra pieces of the Starcraft Board Game<br />
* Poster<br />
* WoW Mouse Mat<br />
<br />
After dumping my bags in the press office and leaving Blill (worldofwar.net) and Rush to mess with techy stuff I headed out the press floor. The booming music and announcers were calling me.<br />
<br />
Not yet packed to capacity the excitement is still palpable. A constant burst of flashes taking pictures of the large fanart presentation, sponsor booths lined with screens showing off their latest hardware with the aid of Lich King, the tournament area and the stage area. The shop is actually the busiest area, there is a ton of stuff on sale but I didn't want to battle the crowds to get pics as I wanted to get my other pics on here for you guys.<br />
<br />
I'll head back out now.&quot; from http://www.diabloii.net/</div></div><hr />

Curved down, then straight. It's a distinct vertical opening around the mouth.</div></div><hr />

Well it says it's an autograph book, so I'm assuming blank glossy pages.</div></div><hr />

You must have some sort of advanced vision or something because I have no Idea what you're referring to.<br />
<br />
And at any rate - the best solution is to wait it out and see the final results.<br />
<br />
Rather then open speculation and arguing.</div></div><hr />
