Patch 5.3 - Blood in the Snow Scenario Intro<br />
Some of the new scenarios in Patch 5.3 will have an intro by Lorewalker Cho, starting with Blood in the Snow. Unfortunately the new scenarios are still not open for testing, so you cannot progress further than this one yet. <br />

Ask the Devs - Upcoming PvP changes<br />
Current Status<br />
LOCKED — Questions and voting will begin soon. <br />
<br />
Topic<br />
The topic for this Ask the Devs is, “PvP changes on the PTR”. <br />
Be sure to stay on topic, as questions that stray from this won't be answered.<br />
<br />
How it works:<br />
Voting will begin on 09/04/13 and end on 11/04/13. The thread will be open for 48 hours, after which time it will be locked and you’ll no longer be able to post or vote for questions to be sent to the developers. Once the thread has been locked, we’ll tally up the votes and send the top questions off to the World of Warcraft developers. We’ll provide answers directly from the developers during the following week. Watch the blog for their responses!<br />
<br />
The Rules:<br />
There’s a limit of one question per post. Stay on topic. Questions that are not related to the chosen topic will not be sent to the developers, even if they’re rated highly. Only post questions in the Ask the Devs thread – discussions are not permitted. If you would like to discuss the questions or a related matter, please do so in another thread. A question being highly rated does not guarantee that it will be answered. We will, however, try to get as many questions answered as possible. “Disliking” a post will not count toward its tally. Only “likes” will be counted.<br />
<br />
Some Tips:<br />
Don’t post or vote for questions that you know we cannot or will not answer. This Q&amp;A is designed to give you more insight into the changes that are happening on the PTR, not to make announcements about future projects, expansions, or release dates. This includes questions not related to the Ask the Devs topic. Make your questions as short and concise as possible so that they’re easy to understand for us and other players. “Like” a post if you’d like to vote for it. Don’t bother “disliking” a post, as this will not influence our decision on which questions are sent to the developers. Vote for any of the questions you’d like to see answered, but keep in mind the above tips.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Small Client Patches<br />
As you may have noticed there have been a few small patches being downloaded and installed by the World of Warcraft launcher. These are part of a new bit of tech we’ve been testing that allows us to quickly release small client-side patches without needing to build and release a large scale patch. These allow us to now make client-side changes quickly and easily, very similar to the server-side hotfixes we’ve become used to for all these years. We treat them the same as server-side hotfixes, so they’ll be noted in the usual hotfix blog as it’s updated.<br />

UI / Addons<br />
Hey Greg! Any chance you guys are going to break Feat of Strengths into subcategories? I currently have 55 and It overwhelms.<br />
Gratz! We think our achievement UI needs some work, including filtering. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/301563639318593536))<br />
<br />
need to make ui able to see absorbs from ss,da, &amp; pws to let me know when they are capped to make sure I dont overuse.<br />
You can see absorbs in 5.2. You can't see their caps because we couldn't solve that to our liking but mods might. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/304336625247322112))<br />
<br />
Yo GC, would love to see a in game tabard u.i similar to titles. Drop down menu &gt; tabard &gt; check to equip or display none.<br />
Agree. We just have to solve a few that have a clicky effect like teleports. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/304337185031745537))<br />
<br />
If you can redesign WoW from scratch, do you still think it's good to support custom addons?<br />
Yes, though we might have aimed more for supporting more customization and less automation. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/315490212098764800))<br />

<br />
It's on the PTR and in 5.4. <br />

I sort of understand why they didn't do a April Fools joke. While I am sad that they didn't do one, I understand it at least.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
yeah...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why? You believe that jokes don't require additional work? Plenty of real content, if you haven't noticed 5.2 barely came out and 5.3 is already on the PTR and 5.4 will surely follow suite soon enough. I would much rather have Blizzard working on making good on that promise for faster patches than some waste of time jokes just so a couple of people could get their jollies. Plenty of other websites and developers had their 'jokes' some more disruptive than others, go look those up if you care about jokes that much.<br />
<br />
Also... vanity cloak? Really? Cloaks look goofy on half the races and as far as that one goes, its nothing special. Half the people don't have cloaks turned on, and even if they did, most people wouldn't recognize the look of the cloak because, it's a cloak and isn't that the whole point of the 'vanity' items. Recognition.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When Arena.net has an Arenacon equitable to Blizzcon, then we can talk about equitable allocation of resources.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">greyghost</div><div class="date">2013-04-03, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, Blizzard HAS done 10 years of April fools jokes, so....<br />
<br />
<br />
yeah...<br />
<br />
So has ArenaNet. <br />
<br />
What, you didn't think there was a &quot;GuildWars 1&quot;? GuildWars has ALWAYS had fun and brilliantly effective April Fool's jokes every year, and this is from someone who's played both GW and WoW for years and years. ArenaNet always has just done this better, period.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
trolololololol, not enough content currently? not enough content coming? and then rather would like to have them doing useless april fool jokes, some are just here for trolling or are just plain braindead.<br />
<br />
Yeah, putting in a 3-level dungeon and whole weapon set while also releasing a whole weapon set just a one week previous, AND had been doing substantial content patches monthly since January?<br />
<br />
The braindead person is the one who's only played just the one game and runs their mouth about what they want to believe is happening elsewhere.<br />
<br />
<br />
When Arena.net has an Arenacon equitable to Blizzcon, then we can talk about equitable allocation of resources.<br />
<br />
As someone who's been to Blizzcon? Like, really, I've been to Blizzcon?<br />
<br />
No.<br />
<br />
Stop man.<br />
<br />
That's not even what's being compared here. So I don't even know why you think &quot;Oh blizz puts zero effort into April Fool's days jokes compared to x company but at least we have our own Convention!!!&quot; is a good argument. What's being compared here is &quot;One game company invested time in a project they felt was fun and would be great to play around in for a short while while another one delegates 2-3 people on the art team to make a silly webpage and silly writeup, for the 4th time in a row.&quot;<br />
<br />
Have you seen the other newspost from yesterday where ElvUI had its joke? A user interface mod writer team made a more visible &amp; visceral April Fool's joke than Blizzard did. Imagine if Blizzard ever took the time to make it so that suddenly your UI began to dance in-game? Or if everyone was cosmetically race-swapped for 24 hours? ANYTHING in game, where all it takes is just a bit of time for the coders and art team to do something silly to share wit fans, and not just some equivalent of a banner on the wall outside of the themepark.<br />
<br />
And secondly? Blizzcon is a crapfest compared to actual gaming conventions, ie PAX. It was great at the beginning when there was more space and emphasis on community stuff (artist galleries, for example) but in 2011 it was like walking through a giant Blizzard commercial. Blizzcon didn't happen in 2012 because having Blizzcon in a year where they have no new expansions to announce is a waste of time financially and logistically, which is point proven that they really don't care about it being a fun annual gathering for fans anymore. It's rather depressing to think about, really. Just don't use it as a &quot;WELL THIS IS BETTER BECUZ--&quot; because anyone who actually goes to conventions is just gonna shake their head at you and laugh.<br />
<br />
<br />
TL;DR, coming from one of those weird people who managed to have the capacity to like more than one MMO?<br />
<br />
WoW has its good things. And GW2 has its good things. Just on April Fool's, GW2 did something better. Deal with it.<br />
<br />
If it really hurts your feelings that badly, just keep in mind that RIFT is still an overhyped failure of a game. We can all point and laugh at RIFT together.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The worst part is , it worked on most people. Do you really think that one guy who made the awesome dark ranger photo shop was unable to work at his job for a week? It would maybe take a few days out of the week lightly working and some imagination to make a decent joke. <br />
<br />
This excuse is the same damn one we get any time we ask for something and they quarter ass it .<br />
Funny, making new, fun and interesting things never prevented new serious content from being created before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What, you didn't think there was a &quot;GuildWars 1&quot;? GuildWars has ALWAYS had fun and brilliantly effective April Fool's jokes every year, and this is from someone who's played both GW and WoW for years and years. ArenaNet always has just done this better, period.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, putting in a 3-level dungeon and whole weapon set while also releasing a whole weapon set just a one week previous, AND had been doing substantial content patches monthly since January?<br />
<br />
The braindead person is the one who's only played just the one game and runs their mouth about what they want to believe is happening elsewhere.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As someone who's been to Blizzcon? Like, really, I've been to Blizzcon?<br />
<br />
No.<br />
<br />
Stop man.<br />
<br />
That's not even what's being compared here. So I don't even know why you think &quot;Oh blizz puts zero effort into April Fool's days jokes compared to x company but at least we have our own Convention!!!&quot; is a good argument. What's being compared here is &quot;One game company invested time in a project they felt was fun and would be great to play around in for a short while while another one delegates 2-3 people on the art team to make a silly webpage and silly writeup, for the 4th time in a row.&quot;<br />
<br />
Have you seen the other newspost from yesterday where ElvUI had its joke? A user interface mod writer team made a more visible &amp; visceral April Fool's joke than Blizzard did. Imagine if Blizzard ever took the time to make it so that suddenly your UI began to dance in-game? Or if everyone was cosmetically race-swapped for 24 hours? ANYTHING in game, where all it takes is just a bit of time for the coders and art team to do something silly to share wit fans, and not just some equivalent of a banner on the wall outside of the themepark.<br />
<br />
And secondly? Blizzcon is a crapfest compared to actual gaming conventions, ie PAX. It was great at the beginning when there was more space and emphasis on community stuff (artist galleries, for example) but in 2011 it was like walking through a giant Blizzard commercial. Blizzcon didn't happen in 2012 because having Blizzcon in a year where they have no new expansions to announce is a waste of time financially and logistically, which is point proven that they really don't care about it being a fun annual gathering for fans anymore. It's rather depressing to think about, really. Just don't use it as a &quot;WELL THIS IS BETTER BECUZ--&quot; because anyone who actually goes to conventions is just gonna shake their head at you and laugh.<br />
<br />
<br />
TL;DR, coming from one of those weird people who managed to have the capacity to like more than one MMO?<br />
<br />
WoW has its good things. And GW2 has its good things. Just on April Fool's, GW2 did something better. Deal with it.<br />
<br />
If it really hurts your feelings that badly, just keep in mind that RIFT is still an overhyped failure of a game. We can all point and laugh at RIFT together.<br />
<br />
Why are you so defensive O.o sheesh dude chill... You're not the only one coming from &quot;more than one mmo&quot; and holy crap did very few people make april's fool jokes this year. So unrustle your jimmies about GW2 and WoW...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Err. You do realise Blizzard is not three guys working from a basement, right? The people who make actual game content are not the same people who make things like the april's fools jokes. The april's fools jokes are handled by their community managers and the web team. So it's pretty obvious that Zarhym's initial reply was a kneejerk reaction. His reply to the second guy reveals that they essentially messed up in their plans and couldn't get anything ready in time. So yeah.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure GW2 got hyped A LOT more than RIFT, and expectations of GW2 where a lot higher. <br />
Also comparing small crappy monthly patches to big seasonal patches.. I rather have the big patches.<br />
Atleast RIFT has both decent pvp and pve, ain't GW2's pve content limited to 5mans?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does anyone remember the year that Blizz took the time to create the April Fool's joke of the 'new Bard class'? They have done other April Fool's jokes, but this one reminded me of how some people will just complain about anything. Personally, I thought it was quite funny. Some people were gullible enough to actually delete existing characters to make room for this new Bard class. One of our guildies did, but subbed a ticket afterwards and got his toon back that he deleted. No big deal. Imagine all the extra work Blizz had to do to restore deleted characters.<br />
<br />
Blizz tried to entertain the players with this April Fool's joke and it bit them in the butt. I wouldn't blame them for not wanting to waste time on this yearly Fool's day. I'd much rather see them devoting their time and effort to new content. <br />
<br />
Too many crybabies. Too many players that just want to stick it to Blizz every chance they get; they continually try to search for any small negative (what they deem as negative) fault with Blizz. Never ceases to amaze me how negative the WoW community can be. Bunch of ungrateful whiners. Buck up or get out. Go play another game if you're that miserable. <br />
<br />
And, while you're at it, go find a sense of humor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizz has been getting hammered by players for quite some time about the pace of content releases. It was probably a decision made by all the staff to continue working on upcoming content rather than get caught up in a project that would only be displayed for one day, and that many players would not see or even care about. The webpage art team might have individuals with talents that can contribute to other projects. I'm fine with them being focused since it's what many players wanted. If they had done something elaborate the forums would have had posts asking why Blizz was wasting time, lord knows there were enough posts complaining about Crabby.</div></div><hr />

I'm on your side, but because of the lag in development to release, I believe this content was done a long time ago. My theory is that they didn't have time for April Fools because of what they will be announcing in November.</div></div><hr />

Possibly, but when was the last April Fools day that Blizzard had three current gen games out (all in need of patching, maintenance, etc.), with a fully new announced game in development, a secret project in development, a WoW expansion, a SCII expansion all at the same time?</div></div><hr />

The only problem is that the bronzebeard and wildhammer are right. Moira want Ironforge in the hand of the Dark Iron, and the only reason she stay peacely is that when her son will be in age he will be the true dwarf king by birth right.<br />
<br />
It is always easier to look nice when you are on the bad side. The two honest clan won't betray the statu quo, so Moira is free to help Varian and mark easy points with Stormwind, but the dark iron aren't truthworthy and so can't the two other clan give troop to Varian.<br />
<br />
Me just hope blizzard don't fall in an easy open Stormwind support to Moira, would be lazy lore to the least.</div></div><hr />

If you read the short story The Council of Three Hammers: Fire and Iron on WoW's site (can't link yet, sorry) you'll see that Moira is the kind of person to lure the Bronzebeard and Wildhammer clans into trusting her just to get them in a better position to stab them in the back.<br />
<br />
She may be dedicated to the solidarity of the three kingdoms, but I'd be wary of trusting her as well.</div></div><hr />

You know most of the old WoW stuff was fake patch notes and manipulated screenshots, right?<br />

Only in the past two years have they done something like create Crabby, the Dungeon helper (who some people seem to hate,) or the Minigames for WoW, D3, and SC2, which some people were underwhelmed by. <br />

<br />
I love how last year, when they did a full blown joke (3 of them actually), there was endless QQ on how they shouldn't waste so much time doing such extensive jokes, and instead should be working on WOTLK.<br />
<br />
This year they make a simple joke that probably didn't take near as much time, and people QQ that it's not elaborate enough.<br />

I had to stop watching that GW2 vid because the guy recording it was...well, I'll be nice and just say an incompetent player. But I kept the window up and just went to another tab, that music was freaking SICK! Lol I put that shit on repeat and just listened to it for almost half an hour.<br />

You can find a lot of the music here: https://soundcloud.com/arenanet</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scionni</div><div class="date">2013-04-05, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Super Adventure Box thing reminds me of the year Blizzard tried to trick everybody with a Atari 2600 version of Molten Core, never actually releasing anything. I think efforts like Anet's should be applauded. No doubt Blizzard and other mmo producers are watching intently. Finally, there's healthy competition in the mmo business. WoW players should be excited that Anet is actually standing its ground against Blizzard, because this means Blizzard no longer has control of the mmo market, and soon they must make calls that we, the players, can only benefit from. It's continued pushes like Super Adventure Box that reminds us WoW is no longer THE mmo, and whether it be a switch to F2P or actual content releases for even the silliest of events, WoW must change to stay in the game.</div></div><hr />
