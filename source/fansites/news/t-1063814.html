Patch 4.3.2 64-bit PTR Client<br />
The new PTR build also brought us a 64-bit client for Mac users. <br />
<br />
A 64-bit client is now available for use with the 4.3.2 PTR. You can download it at the link below, unzip it into your PTR directory, and then run the executable to test it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The 64-bit client is being distributed separately from the PTR as it is not yet supported for use with World of Warcraft.<br />
This can only be used with the 4.3.2 PTR, it is not to be used with the live version of the game.<br />
The gameâ€™s built in voice chat does not currently work in the 64-bit client.<br />
[Mac] The 64-bit Mac client does not currently support the in-game movie recording functionality.<br />
[Mac] The 64-bit Mac client does not currently support the customized LCD display for the Logitech G15 series of keyboards.<br />
[Mac] The 64-bit Mac client is currently not supported on 10.5 systems. You will need 10.6.8 or later for this version.<br />

Other MMORPGs<br />
Unfortunately Blizzard decided that endgame was king when they made the leveling process take no time at all.<br />
That wasn't arbitrary decision, nor did we arrive at it lightly. There are more than a few factors which played into it, but I'll cover one of the really big ones: <br />
<br />
People often play MMOs to play alongside their friends and share adventures. That social experience is important, and it can feel a bit lonely when your friends and most of the rest of the playing population is cavorting around at the level cap while you're just starting out. <br />
<br />
It's true that some players will create new characters to level up alongside their pals (or invite a new player using the Recruit A Friend service), but all too often a new player will end up on a realm and be expected to level up with relatively little assistance before they can join their friends on their 'end game' adventures. There are now also three expansions worth of new leveling content to experience in addition to the classic quest line which takes players from 1-60. We wanted to make it easier for players to come into the game and enjoy the leveling process, but also join their friends who are already playing on a more reasonable time frame. Another reason that questing seems faster is that we've learned a lot of lessons about quest and zone design flow since the old days - you might notice this when transitioning from Azeroth to Outland now, for example. <br />
<br />
The leveling experience is important to us, which is part of the reason we revamped Azeroth for Cataclysm. It can be fun, rich and engaging without taking as much time as it used to. Still, at the end of the day, end game gets so much attention because that's where players spend the majority of their time. We do understand that not everyone enjoys the same types of game play, and we're always looking for ways to expand and improve the end-game experience to make it more engaging for different players.<br />
<br />
There is almost no reason what so ever to venture out into the world. <br />
That was an error we made with the design of Cataclysm, but getting players invested in the world again is something we're interested in addressing with Mists.

Rated Battlegrounds VS. The Blues [1/17/12]<br />
We're going to be pushing a new build today so we're going to be postponing this epic battle till next Tuesday. Should hopefully give more of you time to get the build and get set up.<br />
<br />
See you then! If you've got a three-day weekend enjoy it! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/215863-rated-battlegrounds-vs-the-blues-1-17-12/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3881711798?page=1#19))<br />
<br />
Pet Battles<br />
A common type of feedback we get from players about Cataclysm is the observation that after they hit max level, they start to run out of things to do. Of course, this isn't a new problem or an uncommon one in MMOs, but it's definitely something that we think we can improve on. When the game was relatively new to most players, activities like leveling an alt or completing achievements could be all that were needed to entertain and satisfy. But there is a finite amount of entertainment to be gotten from leveling alts. So some players get a lot of joy from running dungeons, or raiding, or participating in organized PvP. Those activities aren't for everyone, but we will continue to add new dungeon/raid/PvP content to the game. We love playing that content ourselves.<br />
<br />
Nonetheless, we have big plans to keep introducing completely new things for players to do. Pet battles, Scenarios, and dungeon Challenge Modes are all coming to World of Warcraft. And we want to rekindle the fires of existing features that haven't gotten much love for a while, such as reputation systems, daily quests, world bosses, and yes -- world PvP.<br />
<br />
For those who see Pet Battles as a feature that holds little interest, no worries! Like many systems in the game, it's being designed to be optional. Our ultimate goal still remains: When you finish what you do every day or every week, be it raiding or battlegrounds or crafting and playing the auction house, if you want more WoW, there will be a lot of activities for you. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/215869-pet-battles/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3881721958?page=1#17))<br />
<br />
Linear Questing<br />
There are advantages and disadvantages to linear questlines.<br />
<br />
The advantages tend to flow from the effort to build epic stories for players to be a part of. When you put the player into a linear questline, you can more easily incorporate dramatic elements like foreshadowing, plot twists, and a satisfying climax that you know the player is going to be there for.<br />
<br />
The disadvantages have been well-covered: If you're isolated into a personal story too much, you lose the sense of being in an open world that is filled with alternative potential adventures. It's more difficult to hop around and partake of the glories of several different zones at the same time, and harder to join up with friends whenever you like. Group quests become less-desirable.<br />
<br />
As Dave Kosak and others have said before, we think we may have gone a bit too linear with Cataclysm. That informs one of our big philosophies for Mists of Pandaria: Give players more flexibility to play how they want to. We think that the solution may be to have linear story arcs, but have more of them in each zone, rather than making the whole zone one big story with a beginning, middle, and end. In addition to multiple linear quest lines, there will be smaller (and in some cases, one-off) quest hubs, and some of those hubs may be well off the beaten path.<br />
<br />
To make that work, we've got to tweak the orientation of quest achievements. Rather than &quot;vacuum up every single quest in the zone&quot;, we're aiming for achievements that reward completing the main story arcs. All in all, players should feel less like their time spent playing in a zone is exactly the same as every other player.

<br />
LFR Issues<br />
The system is not perfect, and we definitely seek to improve it when we can. We are always looking for feedback and ways to improve our features, and feedback from players always helps. <br />
<br />
In patch 4.3.2., if multiple identical items drop from the same boss, and a player rolls on all those items, the subsequent rolls from that player will be forfeit if said player wins one of the items. A player will still be able to win the same loot more than once per dungeon though, but only if it drops from two different bosses.

<br />
It's what Blue posters have said that they would do (see previous news post) so yes. It'll be the same damage output, just not in big gobs/bursts.</div></div><hr />

Items<br />
<br />
Vial of Shadows damage (Lightning Strike) has been reduced to approximately one-third of previous damage. However, it will now trigger approximately 3 times as often. This is intended to keep overall DPS the same while reducing burst damage, especially in PvP.<br />
<br />
Not a huge deal, It's still an amazing trinket in terms of pvp. Like an extra poison. So instead of me instantly killing you; It will take a slightly bit longer. WOOHOO!</div></div><hr />

Nah, it's not alphabetical order. As far as I can tell, the game does another /roll for the two people, but doesn't show the results, just assigns the loot to whoever rolled highest in the 2nd roll.</div></div><hr />

I was under the impression that the game gave it to the first person that selected his roll.<br />
exemple:<br />
player A : hits greed<br />
Player B :hits need<br />
...<br />
Player F :hits need 15s latter<br />
&lt;roll&gt;<br />
player B : 85<br />
player F : 85<br />

Besides, how would it be more fun to take part in an epic questline than helping a lazy random greedy NPC out of nowhere to kill some animals from their natural habitat for a few coins,lewts and exp?<br />
<br />
Your character usually gets too involved in these &quot;epic&quot; quest lines, which kinda ruins it since there's hundreds of other guys running around doing the exact same thing. Putting the player in the spotlight as the hero usually doesn't work well in an MMO.</div></div><hr />

Blizz lets people in top guilds slide all the time doing that crap. I remember a few patches ago it was confirmed that a top guild was using a huge exploit to down a boss. Blizz called it &quot;a clever use of game mechanics&quot; while another guild did the same and blizz punished them. So expect biased in all of that.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure MMO Champion devotes its &quot;life&quot; on blizzards top MMO games, them being WoW (du'uh, ofc...), and the upcoming, long waited, fan crying, and postponed release dated mmo, Diablo 3.<br />
<br />
These two games are the ones that get the most attention of all the games from Blizzard.<br />

some of us are fans of most or all of the blizzard games, not just WoW, I do have to remind myself often when I make a reference or quote diablo 1 or 2 to my guildies that there are about 10 million more of &quot;you guys&quot; that have only played WoW than there are of &quot;us,&quot; but all you have to do is ignore the little 1 or 2 lines and go about your day, its not like they take up massive amounts of your precious time that would have been spent doing something extremely important instead of skimming the line and dismissing it as unimportant to you.<br />

<br />
I have to disagree, in LOTRO, the epic questline works out very well, with a mix of solo-only quests, groupable quests, must-have-a-group-quests and instances / skirmishes. For the most of the storyline, you can follow it on your own now (since LOTRO also has some expansions to boast, and it would be a pain to have to group for everything), but it does not hurt anybody.<br />
<br />
The problem is the railroading in the &quot;normal&quot; quests, which MUST BE DONE!!!! or you don't get your shoulder enchants etc. That's disgusting. The quests for the Hodir in Wrath were different, first, the questline was shorter, second, they had cool NPCs and third, there were items you could turn in to speed up.</div></div><hr />

Interesting how wussy this nation has gotten and how politically correct you have to be. Well i think this is hilarious. It illustrates how Mexicans are jumping the border, getting what they want they jumping back. That is what this guy did. Jumped &quot;borders&quot;-as in servers to get what he wanted and kept doing it until he got what he wanted. How is that racist. <br />

Heres the definition. Racism is the belief that inherent different traits in human racial groups justify discrimination. How are we discriminating?? Are we denying something to the mexicans???? No buddy we are actually giving them everything from our gov. funding. So there.</div></div><hr />

Was common knowledge when I was in school - sad state of the education system today when someone needs a translation of a basic phrase.</div></div><hr />

Would you like a list of world first boss kills obtained by use of exploits?<br />
<br />
It's gonna be a long one.<br />
<br />
99/100 Blizzard doesn't punish anyone.</div></div><hr />

Then put some effort in to compile it. But I'll get you started:<br />
Ragnaros hc<br />
Shannox hc<br />
Nefarion hc<br />
Atramedes hc<br />
Magmaw hc<br />
<br />
Those are just for Cataclysm, and only from the top of my head. Some were relatively minor, some were blatant.<br />
<br />
I suggest you look up the Shannox-exploit used by Stars. It was more blatant than the LFR-exploit, just not as widely used for obvious reasons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the problem with looking for &quot;world firsts gained by exploits&quot; is that the vast majority of Vanilla and BC &quot;world firsts&quot; were done on encounters that were themselves not even done being made when they were first completed.<br />
<br />
The original C'thun, Lady Vashj, several bosses in Naxx40, Most of Tempest Keep, Half of Karazhan when first approached by top guilds were broken/unfinished to the point where they didn't even function the same as the majority of people who followed the top 1-3 guilds. Read up on how broken Serpentshrine was to the first guilds who worked on it...</div></div><hr />

I think not, an Russian player will never be in a raid with a mexican player. If DB wanted to make that joke they've could have picked a german player or a any of the EU realm countries.</div></div><hr />
