Gladiator's Sanctum Realm - Battle for Azeroth Beta<br />
The Gladiator's Sanctum PvP testing realm is now active on beta! <br />
<br />
<br />
You are able to create Level 120 characters, equip them with item level 370 gear, gems, and enchants. <br />
This realm is for PvP testing, so you won't be able to go and do PvE things. <br />
<br />

PvP Scaling - Battle for Azeroth<br />
So the goal with &quot;scaling&quot; in PvP is merely to reduce the power gap between players where appropriate. In PvE, this is not a big deal. Theoretically if you gain 200% player power from the first tier of an expansion to the last in PvE, none of the creatures are going to complain. But if you have just leveled up (or are in the process of leveling in a zone with max level players), the power difference may not &quot;feel fair.&quot; <br />
<br />
The point of the scaling changes is not to make it so levels or gear don't matter. A player who is higher level than you and/or has a higher iLevel than you are going to have an advantage. <br />
<br />
We were experimenting with using the system to also work between much larger level gaps (i.e. a level 60 player vs a level 120 player), but have decided to only utilize it for players at level 110 to 120 for now. <br />
<br />
Thanks for your feedback and testing on this feature, it's helped out a ton!<br />

Now if that still was what they had in mind today...instead of having the question &quot;how can we milk the players the most?&quot; above everything else. Just giving us more farm stuff ain't cutting it(pvp/rep/artifact power...now new races that are nothing but cosmetics but that you shall play from low level on. Then you got a generic brawlers guild, a generic pet battle system with a bloated number of generic pets...and don't forget to fish. They sell it as content, but in fact it's just same old over and over again). I unsubbed a couple months ago and so far I see little to nothing to return for. I didn't feel heroic anymore...more like a hamster in a wheel.<br />
The fact that I created a shadow in classic cause I wanted to do 1vs1 PvP and shadows were dead in 1vs1 ever since(and there is no other damage tree) doesn't make it better. Their reply &quot;well, now you don't need to do world PvP anymore...you can just unflag yourself&quot; is not solving that issue at all(it does not fix the balance)...cause I want to do PvP with the char I created for that an enternity ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those were fun back then when it was all new and I had all the time in the world, now they are the exact reasons why I will never touch classic. Me and everyone I know who played classic grew up since then, shorter dungeons and more accessible raids are why we can even play this game anymore, and a lot of those who played vanilla have now either quit completely or have no wish to go back to those schedules.<br />
<br />
Their greatest challenge will be getting later players engaged in it. Players who enjoy shorter dungeon runs and less demanding raid access (mainly time, consumables and amount if players needed). I can't see how this will come anywhere near what vanilla was back then.</div></div><hr />

The fact that we are all older now does not justify the swift towards easy content. On the contrary, a grown up gamer is seeking challenges, and not &quot;my little pony&quot; games.</div></div><hr />

Same. I know several players who skipped it, went back to do it in WoD and Legion and was blown away of how good it was. I guess some just had to grow a bit older and not get intimidated by the pandas to understand the quality that expansion had.</div></div><hr />

True but its still not RTS as RTS is, Blizzard seems to go away from all kinds of RTS since end of SCII</div></div><hr />
