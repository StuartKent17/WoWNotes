Warlords of Draenor - Old Raid Finder and Scenario Content<br />
The latest alpha build added NPCs that allow you to queue for older content, such as Dragon Soul Raid Finder, Mists of Pandaria Raid Finder, and Mists of Pandaria Scenarios.<br />
<br />
You can queue by yourself or with a group for all of this content, and whoever is in the group will be able to enter the instance. There is no automatic matchmaking.<br />

New Character Models - Facial Features Variation<br />
Are we expected to be happy with these faces? Of course you can see they aren't identical, but is this really their idea of being &quot;true to the original model&quot; or claiming this isn't &quot;same face&quot; syndrome?<br />
No, not at all. But I don't think we've said anywhere the face options currently present in Alpha are the intended final result of the updated character models. We'll probably do an Artcraft piece on facial options sometime soon, as it's actually a somewhat complex and interesting piece on how the original art was created, and the difficulties of translating that to higher resolution models and animations.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor Theorycraft Discussion<br />
-How is bonus armor working in terms of the mitigation, just like armor? I see a separate &quot;damage reduction by xx.xx%&quot; when I mouse over bonus armor and I guess that's multiplicative? Currently it looks very strong for tanks considering that it’s both offensive and defensive stat.<br />
The tooltips on the character sheet are actually misleading. Base Armor DR and Bonus Armor DR can't be combined. You need to combine the Base Armor and Bonus Armor, and then formulate a Total Armor DR (DR=Armor/(Armor+K)). Future alpha build will have that fixed. K is looked up in the game tables as mentioned, but for easy reference, it's 3610 for a 100 attacker, and 5234 for a 103 attacker.<br />
<br />
I realized that with stat-squish affecting everything, the stats of low level weapons are totally in a mess where 164lv 2h could be lower than 115lv 2h and a lv35 quest reward could not find update until lv70…do devs have any plan to fix that to make up for the feeling of powering up and rewarding during leveling of new toons?<br />
I think what you're seeing is how the level jumps in between expansions were removed. I don't see the lvl35 quest reward that you're referring to. Also remember that in old expansions, the power of an item was based on its ilvl *and* its quality. That's not the case at high level gear, but still is in low level gear. A Karazhan item was better than a Netherstorm item. Now that there's a smooth progression from Netherstorm to Howling Fjord, the Karazhan item can be better than Howling Fjord too, which is appropriate for its difficulty.<br />
<br />
Players vs Lower Level Creatures, Damage Taken/Dealt Adjustments<br />
Here are the details about how you'll still be able to solo old raids (without being Mione). This includes pseudo-code, so get your imaginary interpreters ready.<br />
<br />
Also asked of me on twitter... Bosses are treated as IntendedLevel+3. So Garr is a 63, and Lich King is an 83, as far as these formulae go.<br />
<br />
Damage Taken Reduction<br />
All players receive a damage reduction factor when attacked by a creature that is lower level. This applies only to creatures from expansions prior to Mists of Pandaria. All damage taken from qualifying creatures is multiplied by DamageTakenFactor, as determined below:<br />
<br />
LevelDiff = PlayerLevel - CreatureLevel<br />
if (CreatureExpansion &lt; Pandaria) then<br />
// 10% DR per level diff, with a floor of 10%<br />
DamageTakenFactor = max(1.0 - 0.1 * LevelDiff, 0.1) <br />
else<br />
DamageTakenFactor = 1.0<br />
end<br />
<br />
Damage Dealt Increase<br />
All players receive a damage increase factor when dealing damage to a creature that is lower level. This applies only to creatures from expansions prior to Mists of Pandaria. All damage dealt to qualifying creatures is multiplied by DamageDealtFactor, as determined below:<br />
<br />
LevelDiff = PlayerLevel - CreatureLevel<br />
if (CreatureExpansion &gt;= Pandaria) then<br />
DamageDealtFactor = 1.0<br />
elseif (LevelDiff &lt; 5) then<br />
// Ranges from 1.0625 to 1.25 vs. 1-4 LevelDiffs<br />
DamageDealtFactor = 1 + 0.0625 * LevelDiff<br />
elseif (LevelDiff &lt; 10) then<br />
// Ranges from 4.0 to 6.0 vs. 5-9 LevelDiffs<br />
DamageDealtFactor = 1.5 + 0.5 * LevelDiff<br />
else<br />
// Maximum factor of 16.5 vs. 10+ LevelDiffs<br />
DamageDealtFactor = 16.5<br />
end<br />
<br />
Alternate Inter-Expansion Damage Adjustments<br />
We also want to provide power growth within an expansion, despite the fact that we've flattened the ilvl power curve within each old expansion. This applies only to creatures from expansions prior to Mists of Pandaria. To do that, we calculate an alternate set of damage dealt/taken factors, and use either these ones, or the normal ones, whichever is most beneficial to the player.<br />
<br />
MaxPlayerLevelsByExpansion = {69, 79, 84, 89, 99, 109}<br />
IntendedItemLevelByExpansion = {65, 115, 200, 346, 463, 609}<br />
MaxPlayerLevel = MaxPlayerLevelsByExpansion[CreatureExpansion]<br />
IntendedItemLevel = IntendedItemLevelByExpansion[CreatureExpansion]<br />
<br />
if (PlayerLevel &lt;= MaxPlayerLevel and <br />
PlayerEquippedItemLevel &gt; IntendedItemLevel) then<br />
AlternateDamageTakenFactor = 1 - 0.01 * (PlayerEquippedItemLevel - IntendedItemLevel)<br />
AlternateDamageDealtFactor = 1 + 5/3*0.01 * (PlayerEquippedItemLevel - IntendedItemLevel)<br />
DamageTakenFactor = min(DamageTakenFactor, AlternateDamageTakenFactor)<br />
DamageDealtFactor = max(DamageDealtFactor, AlternateDamageDealtFactor)<br />
end<br />

The stacking health buff for Blood DKs is simply sliced in half. Every 15 Runic Power spent by Breath of Sindragosa increases Maximum Health by 2.5%<br />
Every other tick of Breath of Sindragosa will trigger an Enhanced Death Coil (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/157439-enhanced-death-coil) effect. (5% every other tick, not 2.5% every tick)<br />
<br />
Presuming that partial blood tap charges are effectively floored ( 1.3 charges is treated as 1 charge, not 2, in terms of being able to spend it or not), do you foresee any problems with the partial charges being useless? Focusing on raiding in PVE, and presuming that conversion seems similar levels of use to mists (read: none), we'll be getting 1 or 2 charges from everything bar Dsim, and it takes 4 Dsim's to generate a &quot;bonus charge&quot;. Uses of Dsim are already few and far between, and looking for 4 or more uses in any one combat length is rare. Do you plan on having partial charges decay at the same rate as normal charges to avoid using Dsim 3 times prior to a fight to build up .9 charges?<br />
It takes 3 Dark Sims to collect the partial charge into a full charge. Also, conversion will likely be more valuable because of this change. This is purely a bonus, so not concerned if a couple tiny fractions are left over unused at the end of a fight.<br />
<br />
I'm also curious if you happen to have the ppm of rune of the fallen crusader, and cinderglacier, and if there are any plans to make ppms as transparent as rppms in the spell data.<br />
Fallen Crusader is now 2 RPPM. Cinderglacier is now 1.5*Haste RPPM.<br />

Ferals when shifting into caster form lose our Mastery, AP conversion from agility, Savage Roar, and the 5% crit we get from cat form. This is the way it has always been which hasn't been a problem until now. Previously if we shifted into caster form our snapshotted bleeds stayed ticking for the same amount.<br />
<br />
Now that DoT's are updating dynamically if we shift into caster form current DoT's lose everything. I am guessing this is just something that hasn't been accounted for with the new dynamic DoT system, but I wanted to make sure it was on the radar, and verify that it is not expected.<br />
A couple builds from now... Mastery will work regardless of form. Agi-&gt;AP already works regardless of form. Savage Roar will be snapshot on bleeds. Leader of the Pack will still be lost in caster form.<br />
<br />
How does the new pandemic mechanic for DoTs work with specific abilities that snapshot?<br />
<br />
For example: If I am specced into Bloody Talons and apply a Rip, then use a healing touch to gain the 30% increase on my next two abilities, and then Re-apply rip for the 130% duration. Does that entire duration of the new Rip benefit from Bloody Talons, or only the base 16 seconds(22 seconds with 3 extensions via shred)<br />
The entire 130%-of-normal duration of the Rip would benefit.<br />

To clarify Improved Blizzard (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/157727-improved-blizzard) perk: is it triggered once per tick per target, or just once per tick regardless of number of targets?<br />
Per damage event. A Blizzard on empty ground does nothing. A Blizzard on 10 enemies reduces Frozen Orb's cooldown by 10sec per Blizzard tick. (Yes, that may be too strong; we'll see how it goes in testing.)<br />
<br />
Does Improved Icy Veins (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/157721-improved-icy-veins) affect glyphed Icy Veins? If so, how much additional Multistrike does it provide? (17.5%?)<br />
Recently changed the glyph to be 30% Multistrike. Perk bumps that up to 45%.<br />
<br />
Is Enhanced Arcane Blast (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/157616-improved-arcane-blast) just treated as 5% haste for that one spell (dividing cast time by 1.05, multiplicative with other haste)?<br />
No, it's a multiplier on cast time. It multiplies Arcane Blast's cast time by (1-0.05*ChargeCount). (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/318876-warlords-of-draenor-theorycraft-discussion/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13087818929?page=3#60))<br />

Item Level and Leveling with Existing Characters<br />
Will the gear that will be obtainable from the first quests at the launch of WoD be this low in item level and therefore be completely overshadowed by players' current gear?<br />
Yes. We want players who have spent the time and effort to collect endgame Mists of Pandaria gear to go into the expansion with a bit of an advantage. We also need to make sure that players who haven't been farming endgame gear aren't struggling just to complete their first few quests in Warlords. That means, much like previous expansions, your current epic gear will likely last you for a little while into Draenor.

Profession Catch-Up - Skinning<br />
Just following up: Skinning will be using a similar system as Mining and Herbalism, allowing someone to level up their profession purely through high level content by picking, mining, or skinning high level nodes and creatures, regardless of their professions's skill level, gain skill-ups from doing so, and obtain materials usable for crafting.

Shaman Weapon Imbues<br />
We didn't feel that Weapon Imbues were offering much in the way of gameplay. For many players, they felt like more of an annoyance (&quot;why can't I Unleash... oh&quot;) than a buff. They're also prime targets for reducing action bar clutter. For those reasons, we decided to convert each spec's primary imbue(s) to passive effects.<br />
<br />
However, while the effects of Windfury and Flametongue are a core part of the Enhancement rotation, Earthliving for Restoration and Flametongue for Elemental are little more than a raw numbers increase. Not really something that we need to clutter up the spellbook with. So, for Resto and Elemental, we decided to remove those effects entirely (and compensate for that when we start numbers tuning). For Enhancement, we merged Windfury and Flametongue into one passive (Enhanced Weapons) that gives the benefits of both effects.<br />
<br />
Please be aware that the currently active Alpha build was taken in the middle of a pretty big wave of class changes (for everyone, not just Shaman). We'll be getting a full update to the patch notes out as soon as possible once we've completed that round of changes.<br />
<br />
One extra thing I forgot to mention that goes along with this change: Unleash Elements is being split into three different spells, unique to each spec: Unleash Life for Restoration, Unleash Flame for Elemental, and Unleash Elements for Enhancement. Each of those spells acts as Unleash Elements currently does with spec-appropriate imbues active.

what about dps dk's or survival? they're just % damage on spell schools. Overlap between mastery/versatility... (1/2)<br />
% damage increase to a subset of your abilities is different; it can skew the importance of different abilities. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/474342926739189761))<br />

How is the damage of Stellar Flare calculated based on how much Balance Energy you have? And does this damage snapshot?<br />
(1+SolarEclipse)*(1+LunarEclipse). In word... It benefits from both multipliers. Yes, Eclipses are snapshot. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/474437667963150337))<br />
Can you make an example please? Don't get the formula.<br />
Sure.You have a max Eclipse of 50%.You're currently at 40 Solar Energy.SolarEclipse=50%*(140/200)=+35%....continued... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/474458135403323393))<br />
LunarEclipse=50%*(60/200)=+15%.Solar spells do 1.35x dmg.Lunar spells do 1.15x dmg.Stellar Flare does 1.35*1.15=1.5525x dmg. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/474458773612806144))<br />

Rake from stealth is like Pounce, not Ravage. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/474476289139564544))<br />

No, it specifically doesn't do that; Chain Heal multistrikes just do additional heals to just that target; no beam. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/474331415819984896))<br />
But can it fire a beam visual to the person it multistrikes on? This is The Most Important Part!<br />
It recasts the visual for most spells, but not for chained spells. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/474420829082497025))<br />
<br />
Character / Items<br />
So when are the shamans that wasted hours on flex for tmog getting compensated? Bonus Rolls Something. <br />
I know it's a terrible answer, but it's not something we have the ability to track and compensate at this point. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/474367391913488384))<br />
<br />
Will non-armor items be usable for every spec? Like a 5 man dungeon boss has a cloak in his loot table, can it roll every stat?<br />
No, there'll be competition in those slots too. Just based on stats, instead of armor type. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/474396616913207296))<br />
...class, since there will be so much rng around stats on gear (sockets, minor stats, warforged)<br />
None of those affect who can use items. Nothing has changed regarding how you form 5-player groups. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/474403696340525056))<br />
<br />
Will current SoO gear be reassigned tertiary stats in 6.0 with the squish? or just hit/expt/spirit replaced?<br />
You'll start to see Minor Stats on Draenor gear. SoO gear will get stat replacements for the obsolete stats. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/474615150981283840))<br />
<br />
Versatility<br />
So if you pick versatility you trade some DPS for healing / armor (and vice versa)?<br />
Yes. (Damage reduction, not Armor.) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/474410769463799808))<br />
<br />
Will pure dps want versatility over other stats?<br />
Absolutely, sometimes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/474410932974530561))<br />
<br />
So its basically a stat only for Hybrids? pure dps should avoid it?<br />
No, it's absolutely still valuable to pure DPS. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/474421707755634688))<br />
<br />
Won't versatility be another &quot;god stat&quot;?<br />
Only if we overtune it, which we won't. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/474405125943877632))<br />
If it is tuned lower considering healing/armor, no one will take that stat. lose/lose either ways<br />
It will not be the highest DPS stat for anyone, but will still be valuable for its versatility. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/474406092420571136))<br />
<br />
Why not make Versatility increase healing taken instead of reducing damage? Would eliminate a lot of potential problems.<br />
Because it feels more rewarding if upgrading your character is reflected in your own performance, not your allies', in general. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/474411252244951040))<br />
There have been exceptions to that in a few cases, but for a widely-valuable secondary stat, it's a good guideline. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/474411469719601152))<br />
Maybe increase healing taken and Stamina then? Just seems like the ability to gear into non-DRing damage reduction is an issue.<br />
We initially planned to put diminishing returns on the damage reduction, but decided not to since it hardly makes a difference. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/474421273301225472))<br />
We normally have to use DRs when some stat scales from -50% to -75% or so (doubles in value otherwise). This goes from 3% to 15%. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/474421494156517376))<br />
You don't plan on having Vers trinket procs or fight mechanics like Primordius ever again?<br />
Oh sure, we may, but even in those extreme cases, you're talking about going from -10% to -20%. Still negligible scaling. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/474425702859563008))<br />
<br />
Will dps-&gt;healing conversions (atonement, leeching poison, etc.) double dip from versatility stat?<br />
They shouldn't, no. We already have safeguards in place for other damage/healing bonuses. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/474232019790991361))<br />
Sad day, was hoping to have some fistweaving fun with it ;pah well, c'est la vie!<br />
It's still excellent for Fistweaving, just doesn't scale exponentially. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/474318616104402945))<br />
<br />
Will Versatility affect Mend Pet? Any chance Versatility's dmg reduction or Leech heals could also work on your pet?<br />
Yes, to all of the above. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/474324817437396992))<br />
<br />
if raid-wide Versatility min is ever high enough to be effective, isn't it just the new Shadow Resistance?<br />
If your whole raid decides to stack Versatility, you'll do a bit less damage as a group and take a bit less damage. Seems fine. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/474281493234057217))<br />
Resistance was something like a 50-60% damage reduction from a few pieces of gear. Kind of a different story. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/474281588729982976))<br />
<br />
seems to me that versatilty is basically &quot;all my main stats in a secondary stat&quot;, too strong, maybe?<br />
That's down to the numbers tuning. It's definitely balanceable. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/474232718759579649))<br />
<br />
Versatility = tank stat, plain and simple<br />
It offers something for everyone. You might even say it's... versatile. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/474232400054980608))<br />
<br />
That was my concern as well. Amplify at least had the benefit of interacting with secondaries.<br />
Amplify didn't really interact - was just bonus stats. Playing up hybrid gameplay/survival is a difference. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/474255164358926337))<br />
<br />
Hello! Right now Versatility seems too good on paper for non-short enrage timer fight. How much rating will it takes for 1%? Thx<br />
More than it takes for 1% crit. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/474634453512241152))<br />

Probably not. Its probably just in case people want to go back and do them again while not at the correct level (or wanting to be in queue all day). Probably for transmog gear, I suppose?</div></div><hr />

Holy crap, old raids. I'm assuming these scale you down?<br />

If anything if you solo q them they will &quot;scale&quot; you up by giving you artificial damage% and dmg reduction% and probably healing% too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Am I misunderstanding something, or does this make old raids significantly easier? Right now bosses are Boss level, so they're always your level +3, meaning that they still hit you full force in the face. So even though the Lich King has a baby sized health pool, he can still ruin your day if you're not careful. But if he's always going to be 83, then 90+ characters can just stand there and laugh at him?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The boss level is only used for hit rating and stuff (as you can see when you mouse over the hit rating in you stat sheet). So whenever you hit the Lich King, Garr, Illidan or whoever, at level 90 your hit rating will consider them a lvl 93 mob. Damage and health is not scaled with their scaling level.</div></div><hr />

Todays raid boss: one-shots me. Heroic 25-man Lich King = has to hit me about 10 times with me not having any healing or armor before it even starts to get dangerous. They hit at the full force they did back when it was current content, but not with the force of a level appropriate raid boss. <br />
<br />
I tank him regularly as a hunter to avoid the Val'kyr. Never in any danger.</div></div><hr />

What part of 'camped with the debuff SO YOU DON'T EVEN GET A COIN&quot; did you not get? I have no problem with censers who kill me occasionally when I'm coinable. My beef was with censers who kill pointlessly just to prevent us from having gameplay when there is absolutely no coin reward for them because we ALREADY HAVE THE DEBUFF. And I know they know I have the debuff because it's literally been less than two minutes since the last time they killed me...<br />
<br />
Speaking of the debuff... Maybe Blizz should have, I dunno, made the debuff visible to all censers?! That would have been nice. Instead, as I understand it, only the censer who killed you can see that you're debuffed? How useless is that? Or is the &quot;we can't see your debuff&quot; line just an excuse for camping and it's actually visible to everyone? I'd like to know.</div></div><hr />

I doubt they would remove it was working really well. It was a thing to go there early on, but few times I got there every day there is never much on it. I really think it depends on the realm you are on that determines whether it worked out well. For being on a high pop realm I rarely saw a soul once the brawlers scrolls were easier to be obtained.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The island was shutdown for most of the day due to Alliance and Horde censer douches. I couldn't travel anywhere, especially anywhere near rep mobs. Even if I waited until very early in the morning (3 am or so) I would still be camped due to censer users coming back when there was less competition. I had been on Bloodscalp since 08. I fought my way through Qual'danas, Wintergrasp, and Tol Barad but Timeless Isle was beyond ridiculous. I was able to get my rep, items, and gear with little problem. Quel'danas is some of the most fun I've had in this game, but being prevented from quest and rep objectives is hardly fun. &quot;The more things that can kill you, the more fun it is&quot; philosophy doesn't work for me. Since WoD is supposed to be savage world, moved to a PVE realm to stop a problem before it started/continued, though it did suck spending the $$$ on five toons.</div></div><hr />

And I know they know I have the debuff because it's literally been less than two minutes since the last time they killed me...<br />
<br />
Speaking of the debuff... Maybe Blizz should have, I dunno, made the debuff visible to all censers?! That would have been nice. Instead, as I understand it, only the censer who killed you can see that you're debuffed? How useless is that? Or is the &quot;we can't see your debuff&quot; line just an excuse for camping and it's actually visible to everyone? I'd like to know.<br />
<br />
Just an excuse.EVERYONE can see if you have the debuff or not,no mater who killed you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Things like this happen because people tend to take an abusive approach to think that someone once to be endlessly killed simply because they reside on a pvp realm. When people decide to be an a** because they simply can be, Blizzard has to step in to prevent or at least hinder the person being said a** to someone else. I left the two pvp realms 3 years ago, because it was not really pvp anymore, it was little jerks just wanting to be little jerks because they could be. <br />
<br />
I am all for pvp, but if you can't take what you are will to dish out and you feel the need to hide or evade and not take your medicine from an equal level character then you are basically a coward. When people think that endlessly ganking someone is pvp, then you seriously have a problem. Even though Blizzard does not consider someone being camped for an hour or more as harassment, that does not mean its not. I seen more than a few people leave the game because of this sort of stuff. I said screw it and paid $300 to not be bother anymore, absolutely the best money I paid in this game to date.<br />
<br />
PvP these days is not even close to what it was back when I started in BC, way more buttheads to day than back then and I was on a high pop rppvp realm.</div></div><hr />

Who had a problem with Shaman weapon enchants, usually being on page 3 or whatever of the quickbar? Who was annoyed by that?<br />
I can understand that they want to make the rotations easier with removing short buffs (although i dislike that, too) but this?<br />
The enchants were a nice roleplaying touch, they gave a nice graphical effect to the weapons and you only had to renew them once an hour.<br />
&quot;We merged the effects into a passive&quot;... yeah, why not give us one button and merge everything else into a passive. That would remove &quot;clutter&quot;.</div></div><hr />

The guy is right. How do you mean the debuff icon isn't big enough or what? It's clearly visible to everyone who interested in. The one who never used the censer is obviously you.<br />
<br />
Anyway that further nerf to the item is a huge pain in the back, as a melee I really don't know how could I collect my coin achievements for now. Killing 2 people makes me aggro the half server. So its ~2 coins / hour now? What is the meaning behind this change? Is there a meaning at all? Especially that you'll get a title that hardly worth the effort? As an achievement farmer I miss only the acm points.</div></div><hr />

There were times when I couldn't see peoples debuffs.

I made it a point to only kill people who didn't have the debuff if I could help it.

You know that oath only award killing blow right ? And fail after death ? Making it nearly useless in BG ?<br />

They are adding old LFR and scenarios there. Right now you can only queue for them at appropriate level. People will want to do old content for achievements and transmog sets, without new ability they won't be able to do that.<br />
<br />
For example, DS LFR. It is impossible to do it now, so if anyone wants a transmog item from LFR version of Dragon Soul they are screwed. In WoD they will be able to get that item.</div></div><hr />

1. The reason they put it in way to give a scalable money sink for items. Something that people would spend a buttload of gold on, and could empty out their coffers doing so.<br />
2. Instead of its intended function, people just grinded more gold to out compete others in a rather unhealthy way which resulted in a situation like the old pvp rank grind.<br />
<br />
The thing Blizzard didn't realize is that most players won't actively pursue getting more gold unless there is a reason to spend it. If the game were designed where everyone had a &quot;reasonable&quot; upper limit on the amount of gold they could gain from quests/mobs per week, while still allowing people to trade it among themselves, then BMAH would work out well enough.<br />
<br />
Now, if Blizzard did do something like this (say for a different currency), they would need to cap it per account to avoid letting people just grind it on their alts, but they would not limit it per battle.net account as otherwise people would create separate battle.net accounts to avoid this limitation, which would lead to people seeing the game as having a pay to win element were you could pay for more accounts to get more stuff (while currently they try to limit this as much as possible).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not totally useless, especially for tier sets, but I do share the concern. Don't get me wrong, I'm really happy for this change; I deleted my DS LFR set long ago because I just had no room, and since I had the normal set as well I figured it was just extra clutter. Now I wish I hadn't. That said, it will be impossible to get some things. What if melee want a caster sword/dagger/mace/staff for transmog or vice versa? Sure, some melee classes have caster offspecs, and some casters have melee offspecs, but that is not true for all. I always thought that the LFR version of Blackhorn's Mighty Bulwark (www.wowhead.com/item=78456) was great looking, but my shaman won't be able to get it with the same loot rules.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LFR and LFG aren't going anywhere in WoD, apart from being altered slightly, I believe, to be more flexible in how many people can get into them. EG if 25 people start the raid, and 3 drop, the enemies will lower their stats like Flex until more people join again.<br />
<br />
The only real change to LFR they are doing is enabling level 90+ characters to queue for a solo-or-with-friends run of Dragon Soul for Transmogrification runs, and allowing level 100 characters to do the same with MoP LFRs.<br />
<br />
They're also adding a better LFG application. Currently you can search for groups to run content similar to Open Raid, but it's limited. In WoD, it will have a lot more freedom in what you want to run, allowing you to pug a group for whatever you want to run in Normal or Heroic difficulties.</div></div><hr />

No? They can only attack you if you are flagged. If you are not PVP flagged, people that have used the censer cannot attack you. If you are talking about PVP realms then yes they can attack you, but that's what happens on PVP realms. People who whine about getting camped on PVP servers are a waste of time.</div></div><hr />
