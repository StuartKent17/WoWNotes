Auction House Beta Test<br />
The World of Warcraft Remote Auction House beta test is now open for business! The Remote Auction House is a new service in development that lets players access the World of Warcraft Auction House from the Armory website (http://us.wowarmory.com/auctionhouse/) or the Mobile Armory app for iPhone and iPod touch (http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=321057000&amp;mt=8). Players can browse their characters’ local Auction Houses with the same search functionality available in the game, as well as see the real-time status of each of their current bids and auctions.<br />
<br />
As we’d mentioned previously, certain features of the Remote Auction House will be premium-based. Once the beta test is complete and the Remote Auction House is live, players will be able to subscribe to a new service called World of Warcraft Remote (http://us.wowarmory.com/wow-remote.xml), which will allow them to buy items; post items for sale from a character’s bags, bank, or mailbox; collect gold from their bids and auctions; and more. During the beta test, players can try out these features for free, and each World of Warcraft account will be able to perform up to 25 transactions per day. (Please note this limit will be increased at launch.)<br />
<br />
The list of realms eligible to participate in the beta test is displayed below. If your realm is not on this list, please check again soon, as we plan to eventually open the beta test to all realms.<br />
<br />

For more information on the Remote Auction House, refer to the FAQ (http://us.blizzard.com/support/article/REMOTE). We hope you enjoy trying out this new service, and we look forward to hearing your feedback in the thread below. <br />
<br />
Remote Auction House FAQ<br />
What is the World of Warcraft Remote Auction House beta test?<br />
The Remote Auction House is a new feature, currently undergoing beta testing, that allows players to log in to the Armory and browse any Auction House that the characters on their World of Warcraft account have access to. Once beta testing is complete and the Remote Auction House is live, players who subscribe to an upcoming service called World of Warcraft Remote will also be able to bid on or buy out existing auctions; post items for sale from their bags, bank, and mailbox; and collect gold that they earn in auctions or that is returned as a result of being outbid, all through the web or their compatible mobile device. During the beta-testing period, players will be able to try out and test all of these features, including premium features such as making bids and posting auctions, without a subscription to World of Warcraft Remote.<br />
<br />
How do I browse the Remote Auction House via the web?<br />
After you log in and designate a primary character, click on the Browse Auctions tab, and then enter the search term in the field. You can narrow your search using the filters and options, which are similar to those available in the game. To switch between the character’s faction-specific auction house and the realm’s neutral auction house, click the faction symbol in the upper-right corner of the interface. A World of Warcraft Remote subscription will not be required to browse the Auction House in this fashion; however, please note that after the beta test concludes, you will need to subscribe to World of Warcraft Remote in order to bid on or buy out items from the results window.<br />
<br />
How do I create auctions?<br />
From the Create Auctions tab, select the item you wish to sell from the list on the left side of the screen. You can sell any transferable item (excluding account-bound items) from your bags, bank, or mailbox. Once selected, you can set a starting price, a buyout price, the quantity you wish to sell, and the number of stacks (to create multiple auctions for that item). Please note that after the beta test concludes, you will need a subscription to World of Warcraft Remote in order to create auctions.<br />
<br />
How can I collect gold from successful auctions and unsuccessful bids?<br />
To collect gold from a successful auction, click the My Auctions tab, and then click the Claim Gold button next to the successful auction, or the Claim All Gold button to claim the gold from all successful auctions. The gold will be removed from your mailbox and given to your character. You can also reclaim gold from unsuccessful bids on the My Bids tab. Please note that after the beta test concludes and the live service launches, you will need a subscription to World of Warcraft Remote to use these features.<br />
<br />
How will I subscribe to World of Warcraft Remote?<br />
Subscriptions to World of Warcraft Remote are not yet available; we’ll have more information about how to subscribe after the Remote Auction House beta test concludes. In the meantime, you can visit the World of Warcraft Remote FAQ for more information.<br />
<br />
Is there a limit to the number of transactions (purchases and sales) I can make?<br />
Yes. In order to help prevent abuse of this service, there will be a system in place to limit the total number of Auction House transactions (including bids, buyouts, and creating auctions) that a single World of Warcraft account can perform through World of Warcraft Remote each day. For the purposes of the beta test, the limit is set to 25 transactions per day per World of Warcraft account. When the Remote Auction House beta test ends and the live World of Warcraft Remote service launches, we plan to increase the limit to 200 transactions per day (with a World of Warcraft Remote subscription), though this limit is subject to change. Our goal with this system is to ensure that most players who are using the service will not reach the limit, and we will be continuously monitoring how the service is used and making adjustments to the system as needed.<br />
<br />
Is the Remote Auction House affected by weekly maintenance?<br />
The Remote Auction House will be unavailable during periods of downtime, which includes the weekly Tuesday maintenance period. In addition, during the beta-testing period, the service may be unavailable for periods of time for testing purposes.<br />
<br />
Who can participate in the World of Warcraft Remote Auction House beta test?<br />
The Remote Auction House beta test is open to existing World of Warcraft players on select realms -- you do not need to sign up to participate. For a complete list of realms currently participating in the beta test, visit the Remote Auction House Beta Test thread in the official World of Warcraft forums. If you do not see your realm listed, check back later, as we plan to expand the beta test to all realms in the future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ok, people that actually use the ah alot will have no use for this, we go through 1000's of auctions every day, and were on enough as is. not to mention we have access to our addons.<br />
<br />
people that just buy a flask or some food a few times a week arent gonna pay 3 bucks to do that.<br />
<br />
so whats that leave us with? stupid people, im looking at you star horse buyers.<br />
<br />
now, if they up'd the cap and allowd somehow addon useage, then ill consider it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean I only make like 300-400g a day selling glyphs and whatnot and I easily cancel/post 3 times a day at the moment so you are looking anything between 500 and a thousands posts a day.<br />
<br />
I can see the web version being quite used though. &quot;You are at work, but when you come home you won't have time to run to the AH buy mats and run off too raid, so you buy everything before hand, login rush to the nearest post box collect your mats and then go raiding.&quot;</div></div><hr />

wat? looks just like a regular AH turned mobile.<br />
<br />
you mean actually hacking the ah and stealing gold? or just regularly undercutting people like we already do?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Good point.<br />
<br />
However, as someone who dabbles in AH playing... the bulk of our tools are in the forms of addons.<br />
Still, I can see this being handy. ;D</div></div><hr />

I think he means modding the app to automaticly (without the users interference) /cancel &amp; /undercut your auctions and would check every 15-20min or so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's already addons that do exactly that, in-game. It's actually led to prices of everything going UP. There's plenty of money to be made on AH, and this won't change anything. Except give you access to the same thing, elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

I'm not a programmer but if this stuff is in your browser it might very well be possible to create an external program that scans the data and automatically undercuts or buys everything that is cheap to resell it. Completely automatic 24/7 and you don't even have to be ingame. Imagine a few dozen people doing that -.-<br />
<br />
<br />
oh ok, we have addons like that already. hell we even have macros that can do it with the click of a button.<br />
<br />
But you have to be ingame to use these and you still have to manually push buttons because .lua doesnt allow everything. You can't automatically cancel your auction, walk to the mailbox, take stuff out of the mail box, walk back to the AH and relist the items. All that stuff takes time and some manual control but it might be possible to make it 100% automatic with the remote AH.<br />
<br />
I hope it won't be that bad though I like my free gold from the AH :-/</div></div><hr />

now theres a idea for this thing, happens often for my guild to. run out of somethin mid raid, send someone(normaly me) back to the ah and grab it. if you can use this while still logged in thatd be interesting. buy stuff from the ah while in icc, pop my agrent squire or mole, and bam, stuffs.<br />

I noticed you can't use the AH while you're logged on in-game, which isn't really a problem I suppose. <br />

After you pres &quot;ok&quot; to post your auction, you gotta type in your account password and authenticator. I can see how this can be annoying to people who post in the AH a lot.</div></div><hr />

Well, TRH was merely cosmetic. This isn't, seing as it appears to be slightly faster than in-game auctioning. Then again, how useful that is is a matter of opinion, it might just so happens that this is the most unused service ever....though I doubt that.</div></div><hr />

Really I see this driving prices up. More bored people checking auctions = more bored people buying auctions = higher demand = more profits for sellers.<br />
<br />
200 auctions/day, plus having to enter your password/authenticator every time is not going to lead to more sellers undercutting. But, more access is going to lead to more people buying.</div></div><hr />

making money in wow has hardly any use as long you not flat broke<br />
and yes epic mounts from a gameplay standpoint aint very useful imho, unless you think the FP -&gt; Raid travel time is too much<br />

the weird thing is that wow for me was always intentionally made so its about doing raids, pvp, etc rather than being rich and buying your way thru the game like some other mmos<br />

And now, they are offering this service to those who wanted and asked for it in the first place. Of course, you are expected to pay for the convenience you are getting.<br />
<br />
If you didn't ask for it, then you don't need to pay because you probably don't need it. If you asked for it and is gonna willingly pay, then good for you. If you are one who asked for it and then complain about having to pay, then... it says a lot about you as a person, doesn't it?<br />
<br />
As for me, I never asked for it; I didn't understand why would people need this; and hence I'm looking at this piece of news with some slight amusement, that's all. There's no game advantage with this at all, I think. So what's with all the QQ? If Blizzard sees fit to charge people for use of this service, because their programmers did spent the time and effort to come up with all these &quot;extra&quot; services, who is to say no, especially when it's their players who have asked for it?</div></div><hr />

Although I will prob end up using this service I must admit I dont agree with it. I always thought they said that they would not introduce any pay for features that would impact on other peoples gameplay.<br />
<br />
This would have a direct affect on how some people play the AH and also mean those who can pay would be at an advantage to those who cant. You may think.. meh its only AH but trust me those who know how to use the AH make ALOT of gold on it.. they can then use this gold to buy BoE gear, mats even runs through instances to gear up / get achievements (a lot of guilds are doin this now). <br />
<br />
So in my opinion this is a paid service that gives those who pay for it an advantage in the game... that i find worrying. The star pony etc I never had a problem with.. but this I aint to sure about.. and thats the opinion of someone who can afford to pay for it, will use it and will actually benefit from it. Yet even I think this is crossing a line.</div></div><hr />

I gotta agree here. We had no paid services apart from server transfers if I remember correctly before the Activision/Blizzard merge. I wouldn't believe this to be more than a coincidence if it weren't for Bobby Kotick's past comments when it comes to making money off his games.</div></div><hr />

Assuming you can only view AHs that you have a character on, it is possible that they might have to shell out money for a few accounts to fully cover horde and alliance on all servers (creating 50 level 1 toons on as many servers as possible). Then we can all complain that our server has over or under priced items on the AH.</div></div><hr />

How is them charging for a Mobile AH leading to the buying of gear?! Blizzard has already stated that they will only provide cosmetic changes for a price tag. This closely falls under them, what is the difference between buying something in game or on your phone, just like what is the difference of you being male or female and changing back and forth, or having a celestial steed? They all affect the game on a cosmetic level of some sort. <br />

doesnt seem to be that smart of a move<br />

and also, why cant blizzard make this stuff and give it to us free?<br />
how different would everyones posts been if it was free of charge, sure there would be lots of i would never use this and why dont they spend their time wisely, (like always) but a big percentage would be saying &quot;cool!&quot; and &quot;great&quot;<br />
<br />
theres just no fucking way i would i would pay for that shit, but it would be somewhat cool if they came up with this for free. i would agree that if it was free somethings could be spend in better things, but companies are sectioned in divisions, so that isnt necessarily true <br />

to recap: doesnt seem to interest many, and would be cool if blizz made this free</div></div><hr />

&quot;Guild on the Go&quot; would be pretty appealing to me.<br />

I'm a rabid AH-holic, but there's nothing this subscription is offering that isnt already available to me for free once I login.<br />
<br />
There's a good deal of guild information, communication, and management that would be more easily handled out of game though, and would make me keen to pay a little bit extra. Especially if they're revamping the ingame guild features, it would be nice to go hand in hand with.</div></div><hr />

For me, this may be cool at some point, since I may be actually able to SELL my stuff, but I know that many of those AH scanners actually just run their business to sell the gold they earned afterwards.<br />

Hooray ignorance. At an optional 2.99/mo their profits off of this will likely be exceptionally low, mostly just recouping costs of developing and running the new system.<br />

Once again it's just more stuff that doesn't matter, but if your into that you can get it.<br />
<br />
The 200 transaction max prevents abuse of the system but it also prevents the most die-hard of AHers to really make use of this system. I suppose it's still usefull to be able to check the AH from anywhere, if your really into that kind of stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah there a company, ofc money is number 1 priority, there isn't a successful company in the world that hasn't got that as there number 1 aim. <br />
They do care about there customers, otherwise theyd just let u buy more mounts/pets (even gear), because they know that the 10 million 10 year olds would buy em. At least there making innovative ideas that havnt been done before (and that benefit the player), and for this, they should be credited. While all other mmo's try to beat them with old designs, blizzard take off with new things that they couldnt even dream of doing.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, this system isnt one that will give you an advantage with that crappy post limit thing anyway, it doesnt matter to anyone that doesnt want to pay for it, ull do better playin the AH in game if ure hardcore. IMO only for casual posters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If I didn't enjoy it, I'd quit. Blizzard more than listens to player feedback, people see 200 posts on a forum and think that's the voice of 11 million players. Fact: the most vocal are rarely the ones FOR a particular feature.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not going to be using it, but I see a ton of people just buying it cause it's blizz and these people think that they're the perfect company. I was fine with the mounts and pets...but this is starting to get out of hand. Other mmo's are starting to adopt a $1 extra/month for each character created on their account...is this next?<br />
<br />
<br />
At this point, if they wanted to charge me $1/mo for an extra character slot I'd buy one in a heartbeat. Why? Because when it comes down to it $1 is nothing and as someone who has played the game since release I could use a new slot. They're very hesitant of adding more than 10 slots per realm, which is already more than most MMOs, would probably be a good incentive for them to do so. <br />
<br />
People freak out way too much over extremely small OPTIONAL fees.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Excellent, another way to get hacked...good job Blizzard.<br />
<br />
<br />
Except the fact that if you're already using an Authenticator (and there's no reason not to) this changes nothing. If you're not, you're still only logging in through their site and if you're using it from the iPhone the chances of you not also using their Auth app are pretty slim. Don't be ignorant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, I can't see this feature being much of an issue as others have said it will only be the stupid people who pay for this service and 200 auctions a day is nothing to the real people that play the auction house.<br />
<br />
Although I can't see this causing a negative effect directly to the game itself it really is showing what direction Blizzard are taking with their games and it is startig to disgust me.<br />
<br />
Do you really want to see what their next MMO or even Diablo 3 will have as &quot;Premium Features&quot;? I sure as hell don't. I can just see them doing what SoE did and start selling gear and gold directly to the players.<br />
<br />
Everyone who is going to do /facepalm to this post can blow me. I am an MMO veteran and have seen this slippery slope soooo many times before. Blizzard may have been different 5 years a go but they are just like every other Activision Purchase now and are chasing the golden goose.<br />
<br />
In 10 years time... I don't even want to think about what computer games will be like then. It will be a horrendous mash up of Madden/Fifa-style franchise games that hardly change every year and will charge you premium rates to use the most basic features.<br />
<br />
Good going Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

I'd like to see some tools for getting some auction house data out (hoping WOWr gets an update soon!), but I suspect getting the paid for service would be a bit pointless for me!<br />

<br />
That is not the point people are trying to make.<br />
<br />
It's the fact that the direction the business of consumer gaming is taking as a whole.<br />
<br />
I refer back to my Madden/Fifa-style franchise arguement where every year a whole new game is released at full RRP that has no new features. In the future, all games will be like his including MMOs except that each year you will need to pay an additional premium subscription just to use he same features that were free the year before.<br />
<br />
Gaming is no longer about gaming. Activision made sure of that when they bought every franchise in sight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Exactly. It's not even a slippery slope, it seems like a very well thought out strategy to squeeze out every last buck from WoW before their next MMO hits. They started out by getting extra money from pet and mount collectors, now they've moved to AH players. It won't be long until they start putting the squeeze on PvE and PvP players, forcing you to fork out cash to remain competitive.<br />
<br />
The moment I have to fork out extra cash to remain competitive is the moment I cancel my subscription. If I was still into playing AH that moment would be now. However, I'm sure Blizzard knows this and have calculated that they'll make more money through destroying their game this way.</div></div><hr />

I´m not going to spend even an extra cent/month for ridicolous things like that one.<br />
I think its just a way of DLCs for WoW.<br />

<br />
I can't speak for Madden but I've bought FIFA the past few years and there's been a massive improvement in gameplay. It might look the same to most people but anyone who has played the game will notice changes, it's definitely not just a new skin every year.<br />
<br />
<br />
Congratulations.<br />

When the beta test is over, it will cost $2,99/month to buy and sell from the Auction House remotely.<br />

Agree, as game life cycle will be near to end, more and more feature will be usable by some &quot;small&quot; amount of fee.<br />
Blizzard have great strategy for that, give slowly new feature and in small quantity through years with fee, this way ppl will less react on &quot;micro paying&quot; sistem.</div></div><hr />

So I'm guessing you don't buy these games then? Which would mean you probably watch videos of them and think 'this looks the same' then come to a conclusion that it's reskinned every year. Playing the game a lot means you will notice gameplay changes and not just 'I watched a video and I noticed that this years version has the exact same green pitch with the same number of players on it, why aren't they changing the very foundations of the way this sport is played?'<br />

If you don't like this service, don't pay. It's that simple. And for those who QQ about Blizzard only cares about money, well, you are wrong. Isn't it normal that company tries to make money so it can produce better and more services? If you say this should be free because you pay monthly fee you are wrong again, for example when I pay monthly fee for my internet I don't get ALL services that my internet service provider has. If I need more services from my ISP I'll pay.. so simple.</div></div><hr />

I agree with this, normally I don't pay attention / care about the paid services Blizzard / Activi$ion release, but it's getting a bit too.. crazy now.<br />
<br />
I understand they're companies and they need money but when will it stop? Will it stop? Sadly, I can see things getting into the 'buy levels for X$' at some point, I'm not saying they will get to that stage but with Blizz and Activi$ion you can never say never. :/</div></div><hr />

The app itself is free. You can browse the auction house for free. However, buying/selling things on it requires the huge, enormous, overpriced $3 per month.<br />

Guess they need to bleed everyone of every penny they can since games like ToR and the new Final Fantasy MMO are coming next year and both have features and gameplay that makes WoW seem bland.I loved WoW but Blizzards become lazy greedy and arrogant.</div></div><hr />
