The Road Ahead: Legendary Ring Questline<br />
Blizzard posted a preview of the legendary quest line today. The EU blog talks about defeating Gul'dan while the US version does not. <br />
<br />
This time around, the legendary quest will require you to upgrade your shipyard to Level 2 (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/39057-command-of-the-seas) (Upgrading The Fleet (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/39245-upgrading-the-fleet)) and do some Naval missions (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/39697-master-vs-commander) in addition to the normal raid item collection (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/39000-we-dont-need-no-library-card).<br />

You’ve survived a long and dangerous journey thus far on Draenor. One portal has been destroyed within Tanaan Jungle... but Gul’dan and the twisted remains of the Iron Horde still strive to open another portal into Azeroth. You’ve allied with powerful forces to counter these nefarious plans, including the Archmage Khadgar. His efforts to fight the rising power of Gul’dan have presented countless new challenges and powerful rewards—but only for those stalwart enough to take on his formidable tasks.<br />
<br />
Follow along with us, won’t you, as we walk you through the next—and final—chapter in Warlords of Draenor’s Legendary Ring quest line, culminating in Patch 6.2. And if you’re just getting started—or want to pick up where you left off—we’ve put together a guide of the journey so far.<br />
<br />
6.2 SPOILERS BELOW!<br />
<br />
Patch 6.2: Chapter IV: Darkness Incarnate<br />
Acquire your legendary ring by completing Khadgar’s quests.<br />
<br />
The Final Assault<br />
The campaign on Draenor has been taxing and perilous, but there’s more that needs to be done. In the quest The Final Assault (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/37841-the-final-assault), you’re asked to head back to your Garrison to await further instructions from Archmage Khadgar. Ominous news is spreading that Gul’dan has taken over what remains of the Iron Horde—as if history is doomed to repeat itself despite the valiant efforts of the Horde and the Alliance forces. To face this evolving threat, you’ll need to ready yourself to go back to Tanaan Jungle.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/june/thumb/legRing01.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/june/legRing01.jpg) <br />
<br />
You’re going to need a bigger boat to get to Tanaan, and are soon tasked to build a Shipyard in your Garrison to get you there. You’ll also be able to build a fleet and send ships out on missions to help turn the tide of the war.<br />
<br />
Khadgar will meet you at your new dock to explain the next steps to earning your ring and putting a stop to Gul’dan’s nefarious machinations. First, you’ll need to work on Upgrading your shipyard to Level 2 (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/39057-command-of-the-seas) and then take on legendary shipyard missions until you earn the draenic sea chart. Khadgar also wants you to venture into Hellfire Citadel within the heart of Tanaan Jungle for the quest We Don't Need No Library Card (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/39000-we-dont-need-no-library-card), which tasks you with collecting Tome of Chaos (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/127115-tome-of-chaos).<br />
<br />

http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/june/thumb/legRing02.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/june/legRing02.jpg) <br />
<br />
Once you’ve collected the tomes, it’s time to start Cooking the Books—or at least it would be if Cordana would cooperate and burn them as she should. Sometimes, if you want to get something done though, you’ve got to do it yourself. You’ll have to fight Cordana to stop her from keeping the books and taking your precious, precious ring.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/june/thumb/legRing03.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/june/legRing03.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/june/thumb/legRing04.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/june/legRing04.jpg) <br />
<br />
Once Cordana is defeated, Alliance characters will meet with Yrel to receive K’ara’s blessing, and Horde characters will meet with Drek’thar to receive a blessing of the elements. You’ll also receive your shiny new Legendary ring. You’re going to need it for what you have to do next. There’s just one thing left to do: go after Gul’dan.<br />
<br />
Once Gul’dan has been defeated, you’ll earn the Chapter IV: Darkness Incarnate (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/10021-chapter-iv-darkness-incarnate) achievement, and gain a new monument for your Garrison.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/june/thumb/legendaryRingMonument.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/june/legendaryRingMonument.jpg) <br />
<br />
After all of that work, we won’t blame you if you crack open a celebratory Kaja’Cola by your monument as you gaze at your lovely new ring. You deserve it.<br />

New Players and the Cost of Lower Level Materials<br />
I go and look at the AH and Light Leather is 194 gold for a stack of 20<br />
But then a new player could quite easily get 20 Light Leather and make 194 gold by selling it, right? An inflated market isn't too much of an issue, even for brand new players, when the commodities being bought and sold are infinite in availability and accessible by everyone. Low level players in some cases are even at an advantage, as materials they easily come across by simply playing the game content they are being directed towards is sought after by higher level players, or those with more wealth than time to seek it out. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/377543-blizzard-new-players-cant-survive/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/18124237828?page=2#31))<br />
<br />
Player Feedback and Action<br />
are a waste of space<br />
I'd have to respectfully disagree. Every day our team and developers are here reading comments and suggestions, and regardless of the level or volume of frustration, it's still feedback to us. Can some of it be delivered in a more mature fashion? Sure. Should the level of maturity dictate whether or not we read and consider it? No.<br />
<br />
As you can see with recent changes, we're listening. And I can assure you we will continue to listen and keep doing our best to make World of Warcraft the very best game it can be.<br />
<br />
Hey.. I mean if you guys are listening.. thats great!.. but how about actions?<br />
Actions are constantly being taken. What's frustrating for some individuals is they're not seeing the action in a time-frame they'd prefer which is often unrealistic. Gathering feedback and making adjustments to the game based on it takes time. And if we can pull away from this very moment, and from what's &quot;hot&quot; in the minds of many, and take a look back with from a wider perspective, you'll see numerous changes that have come directly from player feedback. Above all else, it is valued and appreciated.<br />
<br />
All complainers who complain about complainers complaining are subject to complaints.<br />
This is actually not that far from the truth which leads into...<br />
<br />
I wish you guys would take steps toward making these forums (and the game) a less hostile environment.<br />
Spirited debate can often times appear hostile to one or more persons involved. I was a moderator of these forums for years and saw every type of report one can imagine. More often than not, it was because someone wouldn't change their opinion to match the reporter's and thus was considered a troll or worse. This isn't to make light of what you said, of course, just an example of what I've seen. It's a matter of stepping back and remembering what you're discussing. Obvious violations such as language or racism should be reported using the tools in place. However, if it's a topic such as flying where varying passions are colliding, just take a step back and remember it's all based upon a passion for the same thing: playing World of Warcraft.

Flying<br />
Is Draenor Flying meta-achie a bnett account-wide achie? E.g. get exploration on char1, loremaster char2, rest on char3 work?<br />
Yes, it's a blue-header BNet achievement, and credit for achievements earned on different characters will be combined. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/609192147619725312))<br />
<br />
This new method of unlocking flying is actually way better for future expansion and patch releases. Finish a patch zone?<br />
I think it has great potential. Let us know when it lands how it feels. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/608845863276806144))<br />
<br />
reintroducing flying? huge mistake. you caved under the minority's outcries again. thanks<br />
No issue is black or white, design is a world grey areas, exploring them is part of the process. Looking forward to feedback. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/608847340334546946))<br />
<br />
Character / Items<br />
Off subject,but is there any kind of headway at all for an Archaeology title this expac,an especially daunting task with no reward. I have petitioning for Curator title since Beta<br />
Interesting idea! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/608883581520220160))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
I found world pvp was much better before flying mounts. Post flying nothing will save it.<br />
Never say nothing. Players ganged up in PvP combat for Sha of Anger at MOP launch, and in groups on Timeless Isle. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/608879987710513154))<br />
<br />
WPvP has lacked rewards since Classic honor/PvP ranks grind. Out-of-BG rewards might help. Shell just helps griefers force &quot;PvP.&quot;<br />
TI Ordon faction, Wintergrasp, Tol Barad, TBC Auchindoun, Grizzly Hills Venture Co. had rewards. Which did you do? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/608889557291929600))<br />
<br />
For world PvPers, flying adds a complication. Did the Hardened Shell in MoP work for you? World PvP objectives in TBC? TI ordon faction? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/608879018314756096))<br />
also if you guys could consider adding a weekly 'Kill X faction leader'' quest to encourage city raids again, that'd be SUPER.<br />
That's a fun idea (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/608902735841234944))<br />
<br />
will there be a new set of coliseum gear at launch of 6.2? Setting up guild war games.<br />
The existing Tournament gear has had its ilevel updated to reflect the new season. You don't need to buy a new set. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/609120760641159169))<br />
<br />
Is Arena Master still obtainable in 6.2? <br />
Yes! The arena event is unchanged outside of the addition of the new lootable heirloom for Grand Masters. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/609141841229819905))<br />
<br />
How about the Highmaul Coliseum, will that also still reward additional conquest gear?so 3 pieces a week?<br />
A Coliseum victory no longer grants a piece of gear. It now grants 1500 conquest. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/609456579247628290))<br />
<br />
Lore<br />
Mhh, the Eyes of Kilrogg, were described as created apparitions. So are they ghost-like demons, demonic ghosts, or merely. ghost-like + demon-like blobs of fel energy?<br />
This is just MY opinion, but I've always considered them a disembodied part of a defeated species, enslaved by the legion. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/608876159627988993))<br />
Like imagine they're this cool army like the zerg that just assimilates conquered species as they go, but in a diablo way. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/608876371524210688))<br />
Not official canon in the slightest, though. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/608876521734823936))<br />
<br />
Does this mean fel energy doesn't consume souls? <br />
I think you can be pretty sure that it does considering you're using SOUL SHARDS (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/608883839922929664))<br />

Release the Names! Character Name Reclamation Coming<br />
With the upcoming Warlords of Draenor patch (6.2), we will be releasing sidelined characters’ names back into the wild. Any characters that have not logged into the game since December 7, 2010 will have their names freed up, making them available to anyone creating a new character or using the paid Character Name Change service.<br />
<br />
How Do I Preserve My Names?<br />
You will need to log in to World of Warcraft and enter the game using each character whose name you wish to retain before patch 6.2 goes live. While it is possible no one will claim your recently released name and you might be able to snag it again, it is probably not worth the risk if you want to keep your names intact long-term.<br />
<br />
Our goal with this great name liberation is to make sure new and returning players have a large and varied pool of names available to choose from—so log in now if you wish to preserve your unused characters’ names for your ongoing journey through Draenor.<br />
<br />
The Name I wanted wasn’t freed!<br />
Going forward, we expect to free inactive names around the release of new expansions. Prior to the reclamation process, we’ll post more information on the timeframe this will occur to allow you the opportunity to preserve your name.<br />

I go and look at the AH and Light Leather is 194 gold for a stack of 20<br />
But then a new player could quite easily get 20 Light Leather and make 194 gold by selling it, right? An inflated market isn't too much of an issue, even for brand new players, when the commodities being bought and sold are infinite in availability and accessible by everyone. Low level players in some cases are even at an advantage, as materials they easily come across by simply playing the game content they are being directed towards is sought after by higher level players, or those with more wealth than time to seek it out. (Blue Tracker / Official Forums)<br />
<br />
I don't understand how that's not a problem. A new player should be able to buy materials he or she is lacking to play the game. When prices are inflated this bad because of several reasons then that's not possible.<br />
<br />
I doubt many new players are at an advantage, they have no clue how the market works and others who do buy out all materials and resell them for ridiculous prices. Those new players have no control whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Let's be honest Blizzard let gold get out of hand, just look at garrisons ffs, and now they are pretending there are no problems. They butchered professions because of it. It's okay, just don't spout out nonsense like &quot;it isn't too much of an issue&quot;.</div></div><hr />

They can. Go out and get what your profession can get you. list it on the auction house. Make lots of money, buy what you want. If ore is a gajillion a stack and leather is two gajillion and you cant afford Leather but you are a miner then sell two stacks of ore!<br />

What materials are so desperately needed to play the game? I've been playing WoW since Beta and never needed any materials that stopped me from playing the game, that i could not get myself... Need leather ? Skin it, need ore ? mine it, need cloth grind it, grinding though i admit is not always fun, is part of the game. It seems more that players now EXPECT to have everything and do noting for it...</div></div><hr />

Since when? The questline starts at lvl 98...<br />
&quot;When you build your Garrison and hit 98, you will see Khadgar's Servant wandering around giving your Garrison denizens tours. He will have an orange ! over his head and will offer you your first quest for your Legendary ring, Call of the Archmage.&quot;</div></div><hr />

It's there from the start. You get at least 2 stones per boss in HM, if you've finished that part on your main, and +4 runes in BRF.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can get the 640 ring at 98 and I'm fairly certain you can upgrade that to at least the next stage with only a level 2 Garrison, or at least I'm pretty sure I got the 680 ring before I had all the Resources to upgrade to L3...You get the ability to do Apexis dailies with a L2 Garrison so I can't think of a reason why a L3 would be a necessity for that stage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You should. If you have completed that stage on at least one other character you will get more of each item. At least +1 on stones per boss and +3 on runes (more if you get lucky with the rune multiplier because it multiplies the new value (12) instead of the previous value (9).<br />

Nothing is stopping anyone from playing the game, especially this. New players could just do what players had to do before gold become a commodity and go farm it...or skin stuff while leveling. I don't disagree that they ruined professions, and that the gold income is a bit ridiculous at this point...but to say someone cant play the game....sorry no...<br />

If in fact 6.2 is the final raid tier, have fun farming that crap for the next year...They won't announce a new expansion until Blizzcon, then Beta immediately after it(but let's be honest a beta wouldn't start until at best january-february), and at best a March-May release...I'd say another Raid tier is needed personally...They have all these developers working on WoW and still can't push content out in a timely manner.

Based on the track record of prior expansions that coincides quite well though. It's unfortunate, but we usually end up with the last tier of an expansion for an absurd amount of time. I don't know why you would be surprised having a single tier for about a year, as that's fairly commonplace in this game. If Blizz could figure out a way to add a solid raid tier while also focusing on the next expansion then that wold be nice but based on their track record that won't happen. Maybe we will get a transitional single boss like Ruby Sanctum but that's about it. From a lore perspective, this expansion is done with 6.2. The warlords are gone, iron horde dismantled and/or corrupted as well as Archimonde and Gul'dan defeated. If they really want to mimic BC then maybe we see a Kil'jaeden raid but from the lore side of WoD Archimonde is stepping in because KJ's minions failed. Nothing else really fits with the theme of the xpac.<br />

That's the whole point. You aren't. If you have an inactive account with a character that hasn't logged in since 2010, then they are intentionally allowing someone else to take that character name. <br />

if you really, really want to keep the name of a character you haven't played in 5 years in a game that you are not a current subscriber of then you will need to become a subscriber for 30 days and log into it</div></div><hr />

The lore is messed up beyond belief anyways so to say something probably wont happen due to it is a little absurd. I'm not surprised by the fact that 6.2 could be the last raid tier for around a year, it's just pathetic that they continually say we're doing our best to make sure it doesnt happen again(every expansion) and had they not just absorbed most of the Titan developers I would even say it's fine...but they have a massive group of developers working on World of Warcraft right now. The fact that they can't work on current expansion content and the next expansion at the same time with the amount of people working on the project as a whole is just a pure form of mismanagement. It's actually disgusting on how bad they manage it.</div></div><hr />

I am sure that I am not the only one that does thing various things the first time they level a character. I always explore and do all the quest on my main character when I level through the expansion content the first time through. That way I can concentrate on just leveling alts through the content that helps them get gear up the most much faster. As for the treasure getting 200 was pretty easy, If someone is having difficulty obtaining some of the more difficult ones. There are plenty around that are easy enough to that even the jumping puzzle type ones can be passed by.</div></div><hr />

As for the treasure getting 200 was pretty easy, If someone is having difficulty obtaining some of the more difficult ones. There are plenty around that are easy enough to that even the jumping puzzle type ones can be passed by.<br />

From the stats we saw of the acheivs, you are part of a small percentage of players.<br />
<br />
And do not assume difficulty == suckage.</div></div><hr />

Was not referring to the treasure chest as something fun to do. Personally, I hated doing it, but I was also not stupid to think at the beginning of an expansion that later on Blizzard would find some way to tie to flying, if they chose to allow it in the content. I do both loremaster and exploring because I enjoy doing both as part of the overall immersion and story to get into the content. Treasure hunting was a calculation I made that turned out to be a right one on my part, but I would never equate it has something fun to do, otherwise I would of done it on the other 14 characters I level to 100. <br />
<br />
Does not really matter between the loremaster, exploring, and treasure achieves those will turn out to be the easy part. The rep grind at 325 points day, through 3 apexis dailies is going to take a lot longer than it did to do the three previous ones. Treasure will feel like a breeze to many that are going to find the rep grind a continue horrid experience in this expansion. If anyone thought the rep was going to be the easy part, well they were completely wrong. The way Ion sold it last week as some 2 to 3 week grind is going to be a lot longer than that because you can only get rep from the apexis dailies. They can't mob grind their way to revered.<br />

Seriously, the LFR sets for Helfire look better than the Mystic tier 18 sets, you must be smoking some full of something. Sure tier 18 are all recolored for both pvp and pve, but they all look far better than the bland LFR sets that do not give any individuality per class, they are based on armor type, which blows in all sorts of ways.</div></div><hr />

and still they looke way better .. i mean you saw NEW lfr sets ? i am not talking about old lfr sets(from hm/brf), i am talking about new ones, the leather one lookes awesome, and cloth one have custom animations, something that mythic sets don't have. + EVERYTHING is better then new hunter set, all hunters will look like npc's now funny you are 1st person i saw that is actually trying to defend this tier, because all people i met thinks those &quot;mythic tier sets&quot; should be AT BEST dungeon gear, and at worst grey drop</div></div><hr />

It seems so. Even him got the &quot;special&quot; treatment the Warlords of Draenor got in their own expansion. Or rather, Derplords.</div></div><hr />

While I finished it up, I was surprised by the lack of people that were also out doing it ...<br />
<br />
Personally, I only had a few quest lines and areas to explore, but finding the additional 80 treasures to make it to 200 sucked more than anything else i have ever had to do in this game. and that includes the BG wins for the cloak ...<br />
<br />
I'll do it a little closer to 6.2.x, remind me. Also, you only needed 100 treasures, not 200!</div></div><hr />

You kill Nerzhul in a dungeon, you kill Kilrogg, Blackhand and Bladefist in raids, and you kill guldan, the &quot;baddest&quot; one of them all in a fucking quest? That's ridiculous, this expansion might as well have been called Exploring Draenor. Blizzard better fix their act with the next expansion, or else they are going to lose a lot more subs. Also I'm pretty sure the people wanting flying were the majority not the minority.</div></div><hr />

Why would someone who hasn't played in nearly 5 YEARS want to resub just to keep their name? Talk about ridiculous conspiracy theories.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Didn't people also harp on about this last time a name reclamation was done? Yet the people that quit years ago still didn't log on to reclaim because unlike the community now they were mature(not pathetic) enough to move on with their lives instead of grasping to a website based on something they hate?<br />

Nope. You don't need a subscription to log in.<br />
<br />
You can use 10 days trial, which is available to all accounts that haven't purchased WoD. If you haven't logged in since 2010, its safe to say you haven't purchased WoD so you are eligible for trial.<br />
<br />
Pandaria had similar trial period. I'm sure next expansion will have one as well. It is possible to keep your character names indefinitely without paying a cent.</div></div><hr />
