<br />
<br />
Yeah, it's pretty scary how they went from Jaina running crazy and attacking civilians in Dalaran to &quot;uuuh, I'm a little innocent girl with huge magical powers that just wants to do what's right&quot;. Not to mention that she seems hair color aside to get younger with age...<br />
<br />
Wow seems to turn into a soap opera. Saurfang turning into some &quot;I rather die than live without honor&quot;-cliche, Jaina becomes Elsa, Varian gets replaced by Prince Adam, Thrall turned green Jesus a while ago and nobody really knows what he does now and finally Sylvanas, the next horde warchief that will likely not live very long(and seriously, I liked that char a while ago but currently her behaviour makes no sense and hence doesn't touch me at all). Rounded up by some stupid burning tree drama...I know why this is the first expansion I didn't buy right at the start(and no idea if I will buy it at all).</div></div><hr />

Yeah but they needed the help of a Loa and a hidden ambush...without the empowerment of a practical god...that ship was gonna be at the bottom of the ocean before it ever made it to the clouds.<br />

Your pop culture references are from 2000 but not before... LOL<br />
<br />
You seem to have no concept of time before you were born, so only reference the most recent.<br />

You're welcome :) Hey, I played since before release in 2005, with max. 1 year break due to work. So it is kinda special to me.<br />
And you wouldn't believe how many people are dropping out these days due to many reasons, mostly RL =D<br />
<br />
Enjoy the expansion. <br />
<br />
Keep those cutscenes coming (though from previous experience, they are limited and most of it remains grind, of course).</div></div><hr />

Prince Adam? Well, I played with those around 1990. So...<br />
And seriously, not new is one thing: An almost exact copy is a different thing. A young naive blond dude that turns a whole battle around with the help of a magical sword that empowers him to inhuman levels? Who am I talking about? He-Man or Brad Vrynn?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmocd2e537c57a</div><div class="date">2018-08-14, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Prince Adam? Well, I played with those around 1990. So...<br />

<br />
No.<br />
<br />
look again the cinematic.<br />
<br />
Prince Ad..heu I mean King Anduin does NOT use his sword to call the mighty power of the light to awesome-heal everyone in the rai..army to full life. He drops the sword, because, at his heart, he's not a warrior but a healer and call the light as a true priest. <br />
<br />
In the video HE DROPS THE SWORD.<br />
<br />
Again, unlike prince Adam, he does not have magical big muscle, he has not a stupid secret identity and he does not scream by the &quot;power of the skull-whatever-of-guldan&quot;.<br />
<br />
So no.<br />
<br /> 
His arc is he's a healer, a peace-maker, forced by the situation to become a warrior for his own people. And yes, he's quite young with a smooth face. Let Blizzard time to add him all kind of wounds, blight, big-muscle-teen-boy-fantasy-XD-ROFL (I hope not. I hope blizzard will resist little boys).<br />
<br />
<br />
Beside, if you play the battle. He's not really turning around the battle. After that point, if you connect the cinematic to the played part, the forsakens pushes back with a chimical weapon. It's Glorious Jaina and her Wonder-Boat who open access to the city.<br />
<br />
But I agree with you : a crossover between He-Man and Frozen would be a great Disney-Mattel movie :)</div></div><hr />
