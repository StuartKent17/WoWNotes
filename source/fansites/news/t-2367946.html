I encourage you to read some of the Warcraft novels. Or even the preview for Christie Golden's upcoming novel. Sylvanas cares about herself and her Forsaken - the Horde are her means to an end. Maybe she'll one day become a true believer in the Horde at large, but right now, people aren't wrong in pointing out how little of a crap she gives.<br />
<br />
She doesn't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a good point though. Sylvanas is happy to go FOR THE HORDE but only when it's convenient - ie, in public where she wants to cultivate her image.<br />
<br />
With the other racial leaders, who know exactly what kind of person she is, she has no need to show off, so she literally doesn't bother at all.<br />

<br />
The horde had 4 different speaking roles, and we got to see all the faction leaders; and even the slight political intrigue gave us a very welcoming insight to what the horde is going through.<br />
<br />
Alliance got three humans, talking, and all the other races nameless props. There's no way around it, even if you are very pro alliance. The way it's framed, it's only about the humans.<br />
<br />
It could have been as easy as to have sentinels from feathermoon be the spies, have Shandris teleport to SW to give Anduin the news personally; it is clear that they just don't really care about the non human races, and it really bums me out.</div></div><hr />

the siege of Undercity hasnt happened yet, the Sylvanas inspirational FOR THE HORDE hasnt yet happened, we as players have only seen it cause spoilers.The upcomgin events of the book and ingame will show us why she eventually takes on fully the mantle of warchief (or if shes trickign us).<br />
<br />
shes clearly just craves power at the moment. Which is fine, shes a warchief its a story. One chapter has ended the new one is just starting. If all she wanted was to hug the alliance and do her dailies noone would care</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arakakao</div><div class="date">2018-01-17, 02:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Horde cinematic pretty much confirms Horde as the villians of BfA, specially Gallywix and Sylvanas. Seriously Thrall, you screwed up BIG TIME in Cataclysm, not only leaving Garrosh as Warchief of the Horde but also appointing Gallywix as the goblin leader, who, in turn, is now manipulating Sylvanas and her fear of death, essentialy becoming the power behind the throne. Even Saurfang and Baine distrust them.<br />
<br />
I hope Sylvanas and Gallywix die in BfA so we get Baine as the new warchief: he could lead the Horde to a glorious future. With that power hungry selfish rotten zombie as the leader... only doom awaits them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
most likely yes, at this point in time thats fine. Its who she is now, which im fine with. However if she stays that way gogin into Bifa and during it ill be a bit annoyed. Im hoping her character will progress in some direction be it more power hungry or more compassionate. Either way is good im here for the story and im gonan enjoy seeing it enfold :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
You talk like that's any news. <br />
<br />
OT on Anduin's reaction, he just grabbed a thing that is oozing with power and just heard that the Horde is extracting the stuff, what he just got on his hand is trouble, big trouble, of course he'll look... Troubled.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the horde &quot;showing all races and the alliance showing humans&quot; The horde only showed faction leaders while the alliance showed the people, and a king addressing the crowd.<br />
Surely the horde had their parade and maybe Silvannas even pretended to care about them at the time, but nothing special happened at the time, same with the alliance celebrating with all the faction leaders, nothing important happened there so they're nothing to show on a cinematic.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">garylisk</div><div class="date">2018-01-17, 02:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shows she has no pride in the Horde at all, just tools to be used and lives to be ended for her own goals.<br />
<br />
It's almost as if she's a character with flaws and conflict to get through. I get that Anduin had his personal tragedy, but if you want to compare the two leaders, as far as being interesting characters, it's night and day. Sylvanas is far more interesting, and I am loving the political intrigue angle this Horde cinematic gave us.<br />
<br />
Do you remember the cutscene where Vol'jin died and she was left standing silently as time passed? You could taste the conflict within her about the death of her ally, about the changes happening, and about how she was about to be at the head of the Horde... and to me, it almost seemed like she did not want it.<br />
<br />
I feel like she's been a reluctant leader, and yes, she is using the power of the Horde right now to her own ends. What will happen in BFA? We do not yet know, but I believe just like we saw in the preview cutscene where Anduin has his epiphany moment, maybe Sylvanas will have one of her own. Will she walk the path of a villain? Or will she rise to lead the Horde properly?<br />
<br />
It's interesting to watch and find out.</div></div><hr />

I could see it being with Sylvanas more than Anduin. She's always been unscrupulous about anything that furthers her interests after all.

I love Sylvanas but it's pretty obvious from everything that she gives zero fucks about the Horde. She only cares about herself and her people, the horde is just a useful tool at this point. I think she's one of the most interesting characters atm because she obviously has her own plans but outside of &quot;use the horde for her own gains&quot; we don't really know what they are.</div></div><hr />

I honestly felt like these cinematics were a big step up in terms of writing and I didn't know Golden had written them. They felt way more interesting and grounded than what we usually get. I'm very happy with it! I'm glad she joined the team :D<br />

Yeah, stupid mistake from my part. And I knew Cairne was dead, yet called his son by his name.<br />

Nothing short of her being Maria the mother of Jesus will get them to shut up, they think it's impossible for character development to happen, especially considering the Cinematic for BFA.</div></div><hr />

Baine and Saurfang are suspicious, yet Nathanos, her right hand, don't give no fucks. Goes to show how much he trusts her, for someone as close he is to not care about suspicious backroom dealings. All in all, the character direction was fantastic in these cinematics. Hoping for more in the future.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shampro</div><div class="date">2018-01-17, 03:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's almost as if she's a character with flaws and conflict to get through. I get that Anduin had his personal tragedy, but if you want to compare the two leaders, as far as being interesting characters, it's night and day. Sylvanas is far more interesting, and I am loving the political intrigue angle this Horde cinematic gave us.<br />
<br />
Do you remember the cutscene where Vol'jin died and she was left standing silently as time passed? You could taste the conflict within her about the death of her ally, about the changes happening, and about how she was about to be at the head of the Horde... and to me, it almost seemed like she did not want it.<br />
<br />
I feel like she's been a reluctant leader, and yes, she is using the power of the Horde right now to her own ends. What will happen in BFA? We do not yet know, but I believe just like we saw in the preview cutscene where Anduin has his epiphany moment, maybe Sylvanas will have one of her own. Will she walk the path of a villain? Or will she rise to lead the Horde properly?<br />
<br />
It's interesting to watch and find out.<br />
<br />
For a lot of people it's just easier to call &quot; Raid boss!!!111one&quot; than to care about anything in nuance from the narrative, which is all true.</div></div><hr />

Possibly why 'the spirits' chose her for Warchief. Her conviction to survive is strong, and by making her Warchief, her survival is tied closely with that of the Horde as a whole.</div></div><hr />

It was, those are the Steamwheedle Cartel, not Bilgewater goblins, so they are neutral. Goblins do anything for coin, though, so its not unreasonable that Gallywix hired large numbers of workers after he heard of the Azerite. It would be short distance for them to travel, and the closest non-Goblin run settlement is all the way in Feralas. It might be close, but there is no road over those mountains. They would have to take a boat from Thousand Needles through Tanaris and Un'goro. The Horde would have Zepplins there in hours, I don't think the Night Elves have many airships flying around Kalimdor.</div></div><hr />

Which is actually interesting. A strong horde means a strong shield, and as for much as Sylvanas doesn't care about the horde, acting against the horde's survival is acting against her own survival as long as she is the warchief.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You mean like: Naxxramas, Onyxia or Nefarian? Blizzard has a habbit of reusing concepts of gameplay and lore characters, why not re-use the same plot device but with a slight spin on it? Remember, Genn commented on how soon he had returned, implying that it was surprising. And the quote: &quot;three lies he will offer you&quot;, who is to say that the boy king offering the lies made them up himself?<br />
<br />
To me, the scenes on either faction implies that the Horde know very little besides the Goblins, and they are easily manipulated due to their greed. The Alliance is offered evidence that might be partly fabricated with a hint of truth, directly from Shaw himself? The musical cue/effect is just too obvious.<br />
<br />
Oh, and btw, lightning can hit the same place twice. It's a bad phrase. In fact, it is the complete opposite, if lightning strikes a place (if there is enough charge to cause a lightning strike) it is very likely to occur multiple times in that given location. I mean, Empire State Building is struck by lightning 100+ times per year, you know?</div></div><hr />

People like you can never be satisfied.<br />
<br />
Blizzard could have made an exact copy of the Horde cinematic and you would still whine about something.<br />
<br />
The Horde cinematic showed the Horde, having a feast with all it's faction leaders, while the Alliance cinematic showed High King Anduin Wrynn giving a speech to the citizens of Stormwind, when suddenly he gets an important message from his intelligence service. You don't have any context about what the other Faction leaders are doing. Maybe they all give individual speeches in their own Cities, but don't have spies in Silithus like the SI7 does, so their speeches don't matter in the context of these cinematics...<br />
<br />
Do you want a reason why the Horde had a neat Faction Leader gathering, while the Alliance didn't?<br />
THE HORDE FACTION LEADERS ALL GOT NEW SHINY MODELS THAT BLIZZARD WANTED TO SHOW OFF, WHILE THE ALLIANCE LEADERS MAY STILL GET A VISUAL UPDATE IN BFA. SO WHY WOULD THEY SHOW THEM IN A CINEMATIC NOW?</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are humans, dorfs and gnomes and worgen in the cinematic. Soo who else should be there? Velen and the Draenei are probably more preocuppied with the aftermath of Argus, not to mention we saw them a lot. Tyrande and Malfurion... they have stuff to worry about in their homeland, and I don't think they're in the mood for much celebration after Val'Sharah. They're probably busy rebuilding.<br />
<br />
So the center of the intrigue is the SI:7 discovery and Anduin's reaction. I mean, they could have done a Star Wars style pan through Teldrassil and M+T giving a speech, and show Velen holding some kind of wake or other ceremony, or sure, just show more prop characters (Draenei and Elves) in the crowd, but they chose to focus on the intrigue around Azerite. And judging by how this got people speculating already about Shaw being up to no good again, Anduin offering his first line or not, Azerite being possibly mind-altering or greed-inducing to him... this was a better choice I guess?<br />
<br />
Not that I don't hope, as a Hordie, to fight nelves in BFA quite a bit. We'll see how Teldrassil plays out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It wasn't very cosy, there was scheming and plotting involved, and disgruntled warriors wary of Gul'Dan Gallywix and his whispering. You can't get any more OG Horde than that.</div></div><hr />

Its who she is now, which im fine with. However if she stays that way gogin into Bifa and during it ill be a bit annoyed. Im hoping her character will progress in some direction be it more power hungry or more compassionate. Either way is good im here for the story and im gonan enjoy seeing it enfold :D<br />
<br />
Dude, WHAT?<br />
<br />
The horde is on an excavation mission, then the Alliance decides to intervene, and Horde is the bad guy??<br />
<br />
YOU SERIOUS??<br />
<br />
<br />
From my point of view, azerite clearly corrupts everyone who touches it. See both Sylvanas' and Anduin's reactions when they touch it. Corruption will spread in both factions, their lust for power will lead to the war.</div></div><hr />

I do agree though what many points out, the alliance one is a bit human-centric. However, we had much of Tyrande and Malfurion with the Emerald nightmare raid and the death and Ysera and so on. And I do believe Moira will become a very important part in BFA. Genn Greymane is a Worgen, not human... But I mean, he uses his human form the entire cinematic, so fair enough. We also had a lot of Velen with the Argus storyline. So, yes, this one cinematic was very human, and there is no doubt they focus more on humans than the other races, but I feel they have given a fair representation of some of the other alliance races. The gnomes are kinda forgotten though, aren't they?</div></div><hr />

Or maybe they'll throw us a curve and it'll be Sylvanas that asks for Thrall back when she realizes things are getting out of hand. Say what you want about her, but Sylvanas doesn't let anyone screw with her people, even Old Gods.</div></div><hr />

This isn't a feast though, more like a dinner party for high ranking officials. Something you'd expect on the Alliance side.<br />
<br />
I guess it's the influence of the elves that we see here, which isnt so strange I guess with an Elf as Warchief, heavy Blood Elf incluences and soon another Elf race joining it. It really is another Alliance imo, almost nothing left of a brutish Horde.</div></div><hr />

Vampire dude is Nathanos, Sylvanas' personal bodyguard. Orc Warrior is Etrigg who was head Advisor for Thrall and to Garrosh, though Garrosh didn't really head anything he said. More recently, he is Warrior follower if you're Horde.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard could have made an exact copy of the Horde cinematic and you would still whine about something.<br />
<br />
The Horde cinematic showed the Horde, having a feast with all it's faction leaders, while the Alliance cinematic showed High King Anduin Wrynn giving a speech to the citizens of Stormwind, when suddenly he gets an important message from his intelligence service. You don't have any context about what the other Faction leaders are doing. Maybe they all give individual speeches in their own Cities, but don't have spies in Silithus like the SI7 does, so their speeches don't matter in the context of these cinematics...<br />
<br />
Do you want a reason why the Horde had a neat Faction Leader gathering, while the Alliance didn't?<br />
THE HORDE FACTION LEADERS ALL GOT NEW SHINY MODELS THAT BLIZZARD WANTED TO SHOW OFF, WHILE THE ALLIANCE LEADERS MAY STILL GET A VISUAL UPDATE IN BFA. SO WHY WOULD THEY SHOW THEM IN A CINEMATIC NOW?<br />
<br />
Did you have a stroke at the end there buddy?<br />
<br />
<br />
I wouldnât be complaining if they bothered to show the alliance leaders, your reasoning for why they wouldnât be is so stupid that I find myself asking if you ever have paid attention. They didnât show any other Allaince leader but human ones (Genn is still a human) even if the other leaders were doing stuff, they were skipped over for humans <br />
<br />
Every single alliance leader has an animation worthy model., if they get updated they could show up later. With an updated look. By your broken drunk logic, unless their model is updated for the cinematic alone they shouldnât be used.<br />
<br />
<br />
The fact that you seem to be completely incapable of understanding why I have issues with an Alliance cinemticed yet again holding humans at it center (again) makes me question if you are Jason renamed again.</div></div><hr />

That would be a nice, to show her in another light. With stormheim and this cinematic, it makes it seem like she's been scheming a lot. I really hope that alliance shoot first in BfA and throw out some punches, it could lead to some more interesting developments. If Sylvanas shoots first i hope its not some kind of rage/power induced reaction (anything that doesn't give the horde another Garrosh char.)</div></div><hr />

I really like that cinematics. They're well made. Maybe excluding the part when Anduin seems to forget his father's name (Anduin is a dreadlord meme? No, seriously, maybe it really isn't the real Anduin and that part is a hint. It could also be a first lie since the imposter's father wasn't Varian) Or maybe it's just that he wasn't sure if he wanted to say &quot;my father&quot; or &quot;king Varian Wrynn&quot; <br />
<br />
Seems that everything we have suspected is even more likely (Azerite being corruptive, Mathias being fishy again).</div></div><hr />

As stated, Nathanos Blightcaller and Eitrigg. Both have been with the Horde since Vanilla and played decent side roles. Nathanos does have a new model so that could have thrown you off; he used to be Forsaken but he took a human body (like Sylv took her elf body back).<br />

You basically nailed it. His people found the Azerite, so naturally, the first thing he does is take the first bits of this newly discovered beyond valuable material, and have a symbol of his status crafted from it. Which for him, equates to a pimp cane.<br />

I think what we got for the alliance one is done pretty well but I would agree it doesnât really make sense for only the humans to be there. They really should have had atlest one of the dwarf leaders and probably the gnome though I donât think the tyranda or velan would fit.</div></div><hr />

Itâs common knowledge that being undead severely stunts positive emotions. They rise up from time to time but turn cold again quickly.<br />

Nathanos takes over the human body of one of his relatives in the short story 'Dark Mirror' which occurs before Legion. His Legion model is also a vampire human looking guy (more like a human death knight), but this new Battle model is more unique and way cooler. Here is the story: https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/story/short-story/dark-mirror<br />

It's common knowledge. There's no need to cite anything to anyone who's even briefly looked at a wiki about the forsaken or Sylvanas. <br />
<br />
Yeah, ok, sure, she can feel EXTREME sources of emotion. A toast at a feast isn't that. I mean, look at her state on the battlefield of the BfA cinematic during the siege of the Undercity. Things are literally exploding around her, but it's not until she has to bust out her banshee form that she shows any emotion. And when, EXACTLY, does that happen? Oh...that's right. When she's shouting &quot;FOR THE HORDE&quot; <br />
<br />
The funny thing is, in the other thread I'm defending Genn's ability to survive the black arrow and be a warrior at such an advanced age, even though I dislike him personally. You want to hate Sylvanas, fine. But don't go off with headcannon and ignore reasonable statement. It just makes you look silly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes. He is a new first-generation style death knight. He shows no signs of rot like his brethren because his soul was put inside a body that was still living at the time.</div></div><hr />

NE Stronghold in Feralas is just north and closer compared to Thousand Needle and Tanaris, and wtf were the Cenarion Circle doing in the mean time!!?<br />
<br />
The cenarian circle that were in silithus? Everyone in silithus was killed. Goblins have a base in Ungoro.<br />

Those cinematics are uncharacteristically not cringeworthy<br />
<br />
Probably because they were written by someone who knows what sheâs doing aka Christie Golden. Sheâs written a lot of pretty good shit. <br />
<br />
I was very surprised tbh. Usually in game cinematics are pretty cringeworthy but these two were really damn good. They did a lot of facial expressions/eye movements that made it feel more realistic as well (like Baine watching gallywix get up and walk to sylvanas).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm leaning this way myself. Not happy about it, but just showing a glowing rock to people in a world filled with strange glowing rocks and not saying anything was a little stupid. Would have liked to hear a bit of what Gally told Sylvannas to get her to give a fuck about it. Otherwise all I'm getting is the my precious vibe from it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The horde is on an excavation mission, then the Alliance decides to intervene, and Horde is the bad guy??<br />
<br />
YOU SERIOUS??<br />
<br />
<br />
From my point of view, azerite clearly corrupts everyone who touches it. See both Sylvanas' and Anduin's reactions when they touch it. Corruption will spread in both factions, their lust for power will lead to the war.<br />
<br />
You are sugesting Azeroth's blood is corrupted? That makes no sense. If she was already corrupted we would have already lost.<br />
<br />
The azerite blood is the raw power of a titan. Simply put, it's power. The only thing corrupting anyone is greed.</div></div><hr />

There is a possibility that when Sargeras stabbed Silithus the sword pierced both C'thun and Azeroth, causing both of their bloods to mix.</div></div><hr />

Wut? Where do you see proof of this? That sounds as just speculation.<br />
<br />
Not that it couldn't happen, but there has to be something at least sugesting that.</div></div><hr />

&quot;This...will change everything&quot;<br />

Somehow, Sylvanas either knows of Azerite or knows enough about magic to make an assumption, whereas SI7 had no idea, just that Goblins seemed to want it.</div></div><hr />

Originally but it drastically evovled to the Horde vs Alliance. However if you compare both cinematics the Horde shows every racial leader, it gives Baine (tauren), Saurfang (orc), Gallywix (goblin), and Sylvanas (undead) time to talk/shine. The Alliance showed Manduin (human), Greymane (worgen but in human form), and Shaw (human) time to show. Big difference xD</div></div><hr />

Well..... we could spin it this way...<br />
<br />
The Horde just shows the &quot;leaders&quot; the elites... the rest of the population of the Horde matter not.. The Alliance is about everyone the common folks.... not just a table full of elites! <br />
<br />
The Alliance is all about the third estate not the king and second estate!!! The Horde is just the old regime just needing to be pulled down... The Alliance is all about the 3rd estate the common people the 95% that run the country..... !!! <br />
<br />
Or some other pulled out of you butt reasons.</div></div><hr />

I think you either got defensive or missed the point completely. The Horde was focused on the leaders, but it showed all of them united at one table.. The Alliance showed the common folk, but even then looking at the video it is still mainly human commonfolk. While I know it is in Stormwind this has just reinforced the idea that it's the &quot;Alliance and friends vs The Horde&quot;.<br />
<br />
Put aside fanboism for a second and take a look, it's right there and it's why people weren't as hyped about the Alliance one. The Alliance has the potential to easily make the Horde look like shit, they have the potential to be amazing if they just remember that the Alliance is more than the humans. Anyways just had to point it out to you was all, when you asked about it originally being orcs vs. humans and now it's what?<br />
Horde vs Humans and Friends or Horde vs. Humans and commonfolk lol.</div></div><hr />

Its not, in fact, i heard many times as to how diverse Stormwind population because of the cinematic.<br />
<br />
The alliance one doesn't need to have all the leaders on it because the majority already received screentime in some shape or form before and now the screentime is being given to the Alliance character that needs it for development, while at the same time trying to show &quot;the people of the Alliance&quot;]<br />
<br />
Puting my Bias on now, the Horde kinda needs to put every single Horde on the same table to remind everyone that they exist.I mean, only 3 of those on table actually did anything in this expansion.Which is Liandry,Sylvanas and Nathanos.<br />
<br />
While comparing to the Alliance where even before the expansion begun we had the comic with the Dwarfs and Magni, Genn in stormheim, Tyrande in Val'sharah and Suramar and Velen in the whole expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be fair, Velen was more neutral than anything this expansion but including him doesn't hurt the Hordes case because his people were devastated at what the Legion had done.<br />
<br />
Val'Sharah was originally a night elf area, the Horde had almost no reason being here while Tyrande and Malfurion had every reason to be there. Nathanos was in Stormheim for the Horde along with Sylvanas which was equal to Genn being there.Comics I don't read so I'll quietly take a seat. Suramar had the blood elves equally out the night elves with the nightbourne. Overall the Horde has had it's place where possible without awkwardly forcing the Horde into every zone just because. My only complaint was that Highmountain would have been perfect for Baine to have showed up.<br />
<br />
Back onto the topic, I just believe the Horde video had been done better as it allowed more than one race to be shown. Baine speech was perfect, Saurfangs Silithus PTSD was perfect, Gallywix's dum dee doo was amusing, and Sylvanas still looked shady. Alliance was Manduin giving a perfect speech, Genn smiling then talking with Shaw, then three humans huddling over a piece of azerite. If Alleria and Turalyon had been there or at least a dwarven leader and Velen it would have been better imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only character that i agree to be there would be Velen.Since its his mentor and such.<br />
<br />
But its the way Blizzard found to portray both factions.<br />
<br />
The people of the Alliance and the Leaders of the Horde, i initially thought it was only human, but then a saw the rest of the crow.</div></div><hr />

They didnât show any other Allaince leader but human ones (Genn is still a human) even if the other leaders were doing stuff, they were skipped over for humans <br />
<br />
Every single alliance leader has an animation worthy model., if they get updated they could show up later. With an updated look. By your broken drunk logic, unless their model is updated for the cinematic alone they shouldnât be used.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Not using Models, that are possibly going to change in the near future is a pretty solid reason of why you wouldn't want to use them in a cinematic that is going to be watched after the models have changed. Even if they already have Models that could be animated with the same standards, changing the ingame model afterwards is very easy, while changing the cinematic afterwards is a very time consuming effort. Why would they spread unnecessary confusion just to please people like you, who start to cry if they don't see their favorite race in a cinematic. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
They didnât show any other Allaince leader but human ones (Genn is still a human) even if the other leaders were doing stuff, they were skipped over for humans <br />
<br />
The fact that you seem to be completely incapable of understanding why I have issues with an Alliance cinemticed yet again holding humans at it center (again) makes me question if you are Jason renamed again.<br />
<br />
mimimi muh humans, is all I get from your reaction.<br />
But I guess you don't have any arguments, other than pitiful whining.</div></div><hr />
