As we have mentioned, we are discussing some exciting changes to how soul shards might work. This is not an announcement of an overhaul to that system, but it will make shard use slightly less painful.<br />
<br />
When a warlock casts Ritual of Summoning, instead of creating a portal, they will summon a new creation similar to a dungeon meeting stone. It will cost one shard to create this item. Then, anyone in the warlock’s party or raid can use the “meeting stone” to summon other members of the group. For example, once the warlock summons the stone, then party members B and C could summon D without the warlock’s direct involvement, and most importantly without requiring additional shards. You will be able to bring the rest of a 25-person raid quickly (since you can summon folks simultaneously), for the cost of a single shard, and with less clicking on the part of the lock.<br />
<br />
The “meeting stone” will last 5 minutes with a 5 minute cooldown. It will not be usable in areas where summoning is currently restricted, such as battlegrounds or in combat. Creating the stone still requires 2 people in addition to the warlock. Summoning actual party members only requires 2 people.<br />
<br />
This change will be in for the next patch, which will occur before the 3.1 Ulduar content patch.</div></div><hr />

All it does is making your guild members even more slacky. They will probably send 3 locks to the instance, roll a dice and they can summon the whole raid together &gt;_&gt; and for summoning 1 or 2 late commers this chance has nearly no effect.<br />
<br />

Unfortunately, I have to agree with you... Playing a warlock, I have always had a hard time keeping shards, especially when it came to summoning a raid... So, you won't hear that complaint anymore... LOL :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Scenerio 1: Warlock A has Party Members B and C help create the &quot;summon stone&quot;. Party Member C decides to log out and a new Party Member C comes along in party. Will he be able to either be summoned or use the stone? <br />
<br />
Scenerio 2: Warlock A has Party Members B and C help create the &quot;summon stone&quot;.<br />
Warlock A decides to leave the party. Party Members B and C invite a new Party Member D. Will Party Members B and C still be able to use the &quot;summon stone&quot; to summon Party Member D?<br />
<br />
And will there be a level requirement to summon people using the new &quot;summon stone&quot;, or did they have that removed? I ask that because I remember being able to use the summon stone that I wasn't able to previously use in the past because of my level, i.e. the summon stone @ Scholomance, to do an achievement.</div></div><hr />

But why the cool down? I can still use the regular summon, right? If not, that kind of sucks cause what if someone needs to go for whatever reason (ie emergency, internet down, etc) and I can't summon someone else because I'm on cool down. Don't get me wrong, it sounds cool, I'm just not all too thrilled with a cool down system in place. <br />

Stone last for 5 minutes, cool down is 5 minutes, so when original one disappears you can create a new one.<br />
<br />
So if this is the case at any given point you can summon.</div></div><hr />

you nailed it. Cooldown shouldn't be a issue. The real issue should be pet aggro lol. Every time I send in a pet to get aggro the pet will hit the target then move about 20 yards away and aggro something else. Anyone besides me having this problem?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea thought so, silly me ::)<br />
Would love to hear from all you experienced locks how this will truly help the shard problem. Because hey, guess what summoning is not the only thing that requires shards.. But never mind me, I haf anime avatar so i'm cynical :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Believe me summoning is oly the first problem for Warlocks. The real biggest problem is when we are doing instances with little adds or we are working ona new boss and we keep wiping. So every single wipe we summon pet, we put up a cook well and possible soulstone. 2-3 shards per wipe. IT goes down rather quickly and plus if you die and get a combat res you pop your talent and resummon your pet making the whoel ordeal even more expensive &gt;&lt;<br />
<br />
This is a real good step int he right direction but blizzard how hard can it be to make shards stack? &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
It happens to both Hunters and Warlocks, bloody annoying. I look forward to a fix for this, because I really like that they made it so when we attack, demons attack (on offensive), but this bug is annoying as hell.</div></div><hr />

Lets hope they dont use this as an excuse to move the level restriction onto the warlock summon as well.<br />
<br />
However its good - if people want me to summon - i will cast and then stand back and get on with probably the longest prep work pre fight in the game - but we are strong us locks ::) - we never whine or complain :P we just stand at the back and grumble........................... ;D</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Oh.. so I'm not the only one who doesn't see this as a very good or useful change! :P<br />
<br />
It won't save me many shards. Usually the raid gets summoned at the meeting stone... now it will get summoned inside the instance (just to avoid some random horde interrupting the summons). So far that makes me use more shards than before!<br />
Then there are the summons during the raid and those usually don't require summoning more than few people. So lets say we save a shard or two on each summon. And those happen few times during the raid.<br />
<br />
If you need to summon more people because they come to raids unprepared then that is a problem with your guild and not your summon spell!<br />
<br />
In best case I'll save a couple of shards per raid. Big deal. I'll just drain them from the trash.<br />
Oh... and since you'll now need to 1) make the summon stone and 2) use it... this means: more clicking (for those who actually click the portals).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Scen 1: If the stone only requires 2 members in your party once created, flexing players in the party to use it shouldnt be an issue (within the 5 minute duration)<br />
<br />
Scen 2: We've had party members continue to use the mage food table after the mage logs out. Dont see how the mechanic would be any different<br />
<br />
Level reqt: I think saying it was like an instance summoning stone was a way to describe it as a physical clickable object on the ground that was independent of the warlock. Warlocks have no level requirements on their summoning spell, so I wouldnt expect any on this conjured stone version. <br />
<br />
Honestly, Blizz should simply wipe out the ones on the permanent stones -- legitimate 5-mans in pre-BC content are so rare that these stones are pretty worthless now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The two situations are not even close to equivalent. If you couldnt cast conjure food or conjure water while your table was down, then it would be the same. But you can, so its not.<br />
<br />
Ritual of Summoning is the one and only spell, and it currently has no cooldown. The change basically means you can still always summon, but the location you do the summons from will remain the same for 5 min (unless another lock is in the party to set up another location).</div></div><hr />
