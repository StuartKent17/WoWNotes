New Real ID Party Feature Now Available for Testing<br />
You heard it here first, the news is now official! the Real ID Party Feature is now available for testing!<br />
When delving into the depths of Azeroth's darkest dungeons, it always helps to have some friends at your side... now you're able to issue a call to arms no matter what realm they play on. We're pleased to announce the new Real ID Party feature is now available for testing! This new feature will allow World of Warcraft players to invite their real-life Real ID friends of the same faction to a party regardless of the realm they play on, and then queue up for a 5-player regular or Heroic dungeon.<br />
<br />
To learn more about Real ID, please visit the Real ID web page (http://us.battle.net/en/realid/) and read the FAQ (http://us.battle.net/en/realid/faq).<br />
<br />
For more information about how the Real ID Party system works, check out the FAQ below.<br />
<br />
Real ID Party Feature – Test Phase FAQ<br />
<br />
Q: What is the Real ID Party feature?<br />
A: Players can now invite Real ID friends of the same faction to a 5-player normal or Heroic dungeon group, regardless of what realm their friends are on. This system is designed to make it easier for real-life friends to play together.<br />
<br />
Q: How do I invite Real ID friends to a Real ID party?<br />
A: Inviting a Real ID friend to a Real ID Party is simple. Just open up your Friends list to see which Real ID friends are online. Click on the “Plus” button to send an invitation to a Real ID friend to join your group. You can continue to add Real ID friends to your party until the group is complete. If you cannot complete the group with Real ID friends, you are free to join the Dungeon Finder to fill in the missing roles. <br />
<br />
Q: Does a player need to have Real ID enabled to accept a Real ID group invite?<br />
A: Yes, a player must have Real ID enabled, and both players must be Real ID friends to accept or initiate Real ID party invitations.<br />
<br />
Q: Can a party leader invite a mix of Real ID friends, character-level friends, guildmates, or random players to the same party?<br />
A: A party leader can invite any combination of Real ID friends from any realm, guildmates from the same realm, or other characters from the same realm to the same party. If the party leader isn’t able to fill up the entire party, the Dungeon Finder can fill in the missing roles.<br />
<br />
Q: Can I invite someone who is not a Real ID friend?<br />
A: You can only invite members to a party if they are on your Real ID friends list or if they are on the same realm as you are.<br />
<br />
Q: Can I invite a friend of a Real ID friend?<br />
A: No, you can only invite those who are Real ID friends with you directly to the party.<br />
<br />
Q: How long will the testing period last?<br />
A: We haven’t yet determined how long the testing period will last. We'll keep you updated on the status and inform you when the test period is going to end in the future.<br />
<br />
Q: Will aspects of the Real ID Party system be premium-based?<br />
A: We'll have information on the premium-based aspects of the Real ID Party system toward the end of the testing period.<br />

Season Transition Compensation Action<br />
For our lack of forewarning on the inclusion of new item level 371 gear with Season 10 we’ll be providing the previously announced (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2794770941) 4000 Honor Point compensation during scheduled maintenance on July 19.<br />
<br />
During maintenance, 4000 Honor Points will be automatically applied to all characters that spent Honor on any item level 365 items following the release of 4.2, between the June 28 and July 5 maintenances.<br />
<br />
The compensation Honor Points given will be able to go over the point cap, but anyone who goes over will not be able to earn more Honor until they spend under the 4000 cap. Any Honor over the cap will need to be spent before the start of Season 11 when it will be converted to gold. Any characters receiving the compensation honor will also receive an in-game mail explaining the compensation and additional details.<br />
<br />
Again, we apologize for not communicating the item level 371 gear introduction, and hope these 4000 Honor Points will offer you some help in obtaining the correct items.</div></div><hr />

I'm excited for the feature but won't pay for it, and I'm worried about what Blizzard will decide should be included in a patch or charged to the customer in the future. I get paying for pets and vanity items to use on your character, and the Mobile features that let you interact with the game outside of physically playing it, those make sense. I don't understand why we should pay for something that enhances the game itself, with other players.</div></div><hr />

Subscriber numbers for WoW have been flat now for a couple of years, that means the only way they can make more money is to extract more and more from those who are actually playing the game.

I get your point, but if this feature takes off then there's no reason for Blizz to not cut back other features that would've gone out for free, and instead only make it available through purchase. I don't blame Blizz for wanting more money, and they offer a great product, but keep the micro-transactions to pets and mounts not in game features.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard do this because its what is required with an mmo, If they didn't do what you described no one would play it. I pay my sub free for in game content, which Real Id party's will be, allowing me to play with cross realm friends, why should i pay another fee for this?</div></div><hr />

Jador the game... you've lost it stop now. p2p game should not have a premium serves that lets you play with friend it should do that with the 15$. The fact is that Bliz is using that 15$ to make something that they will sell at x$ and not spending money on the game only the premium features.

<br />
At this point, there is no question that it will be a paid feature, at least certain aspects of it. The only thing still up in the air is what the cost will be and what parts of this require the payment.</div></div><hr />

LFD tool<br />

Pet Store<br />
Mount Store<br />
Aion<br />
Rift<br />
You didn't get it. Blizzard stated that there would never be paid features that would affect gaming. mounts and pets are one thing, but having to pay to play with others is another. <br />
If they going forward with this to be payed then expect more stuff that affect our gaming to be a payed service like Dungeon Finder. And with it the change of the game to Free For All</div></div><hr />

I usually find the whole &quot;the sky is falling&quot; theory's quite funny and pretty damn stupid.

If a company is not making profit then its time to make something that will make more money, This way is just fail. Yeah sure some will pay for it. But why not try and get more ppl to play the game? Fix the game it self. Upgrade the game what ever. But to take money so you can play whit your friends? No way. If something it has to be free.</div></div><hr />

THIS. Since release Rift has been 1-upping WoW in every fashion. You can only transfer every 7 days though, not anytime you want. But yeah, character and guild transfers for free.

I thought we got this rage out of the way when they originally announced this as a premium feature or are people just really behind? As for the honor thing, I never thought they'd go with such broad strokes to resolve it but I guess it all evens out in the end. Granted I'm not going to get the 14k or whatever back on 1 toon but it reads like all the toons I only had buy 1 or 2 pieces might actually come out ahead :D<br />

Not everyone mind to raid with friends, the simple feature to have some fun together for free cross-realms, will reduce the amount of people transferring A LOT. <br />
<br />
My realm is dead, all my friends play in other place, I'm casual and I don't mind playing every single pixel of content with someone. I'm forced to transfer..<br />
..if I was able to play at least a couple of dungeons with my friends, I won't transfer anymore..<br />
<br />
It's bullshit, agree. Just look it from the Blizz side, a transfer in EU is 20 € per char, have you idea how much money they get from it? Nerfing the transfers would be a suicide move from Blizz.</div></div><hr />

hey, you know the 15$ from wow only mean that you have access to the game, that doesn't mean that you have any rights or that you are a valued customer of any sort, no no. That doesn't mean they can't introduce a new pvp set 1 week after the patch without notice aswell. I mean communication eats resources which could be better spent in developing premium content. OH how about premium communication? tiny bits of information that are exclusive to the premium customer, for a tiny monthly fee. never spend your honor on an soon-to-be-obsolete pvp set ever again!!<br />

I still have mmo-champ in my facebook feed because it reminds me to watch the mmo-report, and in case something cool actually happens in WoW I'd like to know about it. I also hold fleeting hopes that mmo-champ will one day be mmo-champ and not WoW-champ. (I know Boub has said he's not doing anything other than WoW and that saddens me, but the day WoW goes by the wayside I'm interested to see what happens.)

Yeah, I mean, I don't know about you guys, but I'd rather play a crappier game as long as they let me xfer as much as I want, you know? And those guys at Trion are genius.

When I did my free Trial of Rift just over a month ago they didn't have server transfers, let alone free transfers. People were crying as the servers became deserted and people quit and they couldn't get to their friends without re-rolling. So hats off to Trion for allowing this feature but it was more for damage control than providing a service similar to Wow.</div></div><hr />

I said this as a response on the blog and I'll post it here as well:<br />
<br />
We greatly appreciate constructive feedback about this, but as we mention in the FAQ above we'll have information about a cost for premium services at a future point in time. For now, all anyone is able to do is &quot;guess&quot; at what this could mean. Let's focus on testing for now and avoid supposition about any sort of cost at this point in time. It's too easy for people to get involved in hearsay that is inaccurate or misleading.<br />
<br />
We know people have concerns over this and get a bit itchy about the word &quot;premium&quot;, but for now the answer we can give is the one in the FAQ. Your constructive feedback though is helpful in the testing of the feature and will help us make sure it's serving the community in the best possible way. What we want to avoid is people getting ahead of themselves and guessing at prices or spreading misinformation or rumor. We want this to be successful. We want the community to find value in it being available to them.<br />
<br />
This is just one of several ways in which people can get together with their friends whether that includes them relocating realms and factions or not. It's simply an additional choice that will hopefully make your time in the game more enjoyable for you and your friends. It's not any more sinister than that.</div></div><hr />

Feel free to backup what you say, what exactly do you think is &quot;crappier&quot; about the Rift than WoW?<br />
<br />
On topic: This does seem like a way to balance out a bit of the profit they will lose from people not server transferring. Of course 5 man dungeons are not the only reason someone would server transfer, especially pvpers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your douchenozzle is open full-blast. Turn it down a bit.<br />
<br />
One, everyone playing WoW is paying for WoW. Every month.<br />
<br />
Two, this cross-realm grouping tech has been in the game since Wrath. This isn't new. They didn't set aside development time JUST for RealID grouping.They originally developed cross-realm grouping to breathe life into the game and keep players happy (and playing, and paying). Now, they're taking the system that matched you with random cross-realm people and allowing it to match you with specific cross-realm people.<br />
<br />
Three, it's a lame cash-grab to monetize development efforts that occurred years ago.</div></div><hr />

You could use this same argument to justify having to pay a premium for any feature. In fact, they spend a whole lot more development time on raids, why don't they start making raids optional DLC?</div></div><hr />

Oh the subs lost argument again. Let's see some numbers right now.<br />
<br />
Free account/trial account has always been there. It just doesn't expire now and stops at 20 which is similar to other games.<br />
<br />
RAF to 80 is a no brainer. Who's going to recruit a friend and stop 25 levels before the max. It should have been upped every time the level cap raised. Don't confuse Blizzard with being naturally slow to react to things with desperation.</div></div><hr />

Oh goody, so more people playing the game than ever before all paying a monthly subscription, and paying for expansions doesn't cover that? A Blizzard store selling vanity items, and a premium remote AH feature doesn't cover that? You are talking out of something that isn't your mouth. I suggest you get a clue.</div></div><hr />

The way Real ID works now makes it a feature only worth using for close chat buddies but with this feature LFD dungeons might stop being alienated by anonymity since e.g. if you befriend that tank instead of pissing him off you could group with him again and not have to wait 30 minutes to get into a dungeon.<br />
<br />
I think this decision will be important to the future of WoW: Cataclysm isn't doing as good as WotLK because of its lack of new features and if Blizz decides new features should be sold separately from expansions then it will truly be the mark of the game's downfall. I don't think Blizz will even make as much from making this a premium feature as they would from adding it for &quot;free&quot; since it might bring more customers back to the game/keep people playing for longer.</div></div><hr />

Being able to use this gives people a chance to judge it. If it really is such a big deal im sure something would be done about it, because people are not paying for it and calling it a greedy thing or something(i dunno), and blizzard is being sent complaints. They seem aware of cost conserns so who knows what could happen. Maybe the costly features wont be the most obvious ones. And if it is maybe they'll remove the price from that part and add something else in place. Many wow players have realID friends. Just wait til testings over. Then they'll judge whether its worth buying. It doesnt even seem like that big a deal but the players might think otherwise. (think of it as a guy taste testing a new product and not buying it.)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cirque</div><div class="date">2011-07-15, 01:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically what I'm seeing this is as their attempt to double charge customers. I am perfectly fine with charging for things that are outside of game play such as the mobile armory and some of the special pets. However out subscription fee is supposed to go to maint. development and access to everything within the game. By even thinking of charging for a feature that is inside the game, using a feature that is basically forced upon everybody they are planning to double charge customers.<br />
<br />
And you don't think our subscription fee isn't spend on those pets/mounts/oustidegame features? Of course it is. The mounts and pets and mobile AH was just the start of this all, as many people stated back then, and here we are. Surprised I haven't seen a &quot;told you so&quot; post yet, to be honest. The pets and mounts was just paving the path for more, mellowing us up for more premium crap, and this too seems like a small feature, so after pets and mounts, why not.... Etc.<br />
<br />
I understand Blizzard is a company but if they'd up the quality of their game they wouldn't have money/stockholder/CEO issues to begin with. We're 6 months into this game and look in what state Cata is? I mean I'm not complaining, I'm enjoying Firelands progress, but let's be fair, the majority of players can't touch that content with a 12 foot stick and they're stuck doing the same shit they've been doing for months on servers that get emptier and emptier by the day. I for one am absolutely sick and tired of ZA/ZG, I mean I was sick and tired of them when they were raids, and I don't even do them so often, so yeah I can imagine why people just unsub this game. Why would they pay for the same grind for months?<br />
<br />
That's the bottomline. They're pumping subscription money in mounts, pets, mobile AH, now this real ID feature, instead of improving the quality of the game overall. It's a bandage to an issue that can only be fixed by improving the quality of the game.<br />

wow, this is quite the big deal to people. am i missing something, or can't you just not pay for it if you don't want it? :x<br />
<br />
It's about the principle behind it. We already paid for the development of it with our subscription money, so no, we can't decide to not pay for it - and besides, where does this end? Are we gonna be paying for premium features from now on with our sub money, and will normal content available to everyone come even more scarcely than it is currently?<br />
<br />
I think these are valid concerns and yes it pisses me off no end that Blizzard is trying to milk customers this way instead of improving their game so people actually want to stick around (see my previous post).</div></div><hr />

No this do not change YOUR game play anyhow if you choose not to use it, yes it will 'change' your game play if you choose to use it but only in way like LFD tool did... Why ppl think they should have access to this for free? They do not have access to free realms transfer... And realm transfer affects game play too!!! omg! now crycry? No ppl do not cry because &quot;You don't have to transfer if you are happy/don't want to/have no money to do it...&quot; and yet this same argument can be said for this REAL-id tool... no one forces you to use it. You can still have random dungeons and benefit from them (ie. satchels, money, badges) with traditional lfd tool with random ppl, or you can choose that you want to play with your friends but dont want to transfer cos your guild/gf/bf/childhood is in current server. I somehow fail to see why this is such drama that blizz chooses to charge for this?</div></div><hr />

Haha I'm guessing you too are a developer or at some level of the development process. I agree with you, but then again I disagree with you (I'm a complicated person!). Being a developer myself I know that when I do work on things I want to be paid for the work that I do. However this is something that you are paying for on a subscriptional basis which, in my opinion, gives you the right to newly developed content. Grated though this isn't something that you need to play and is additive sugar to the cake so to speak. I believe that the best pricing format for this would be a one time buy that would be static across all games that blizzard makes (including future mmos). But if this is a subscription based thing I don't feel that they're providing enough additional content to warrant an additional subscription.<br />
<br />
However good on the development team for adding features to the game that are sort of outside the box.</div></div><hr />

There's this thing called a monthly fee. I don't know if you have heard about it.</div></div><hr />

Okay, you're just trolling.<br />
<br />
Edit: If you aren't trolling, you probably don't have a job or money. So, your opinion doesn't matter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In fact I do have both and even real life to top that... Why you think I'm trolling? cos I cant see why this is so big problem to some one? Some one even said that Blizz is charging money from him to play with his friends? Can you tell me hows that? Atm you have no change to play with your friends if you dont either a)reroll (time consuming)<br />
b)migrate (again cost money)<br />
So now, instead of paying for transfer you are in fact able to play with your friend... So please mister tell me how _I'm trolling_? instead of you guys who apparently cant stand a fact that some one who wants, have money to do so, can play with his friend on other server?</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Constantly update/balance 10 classes<br />
<br />
2. Constantly update pve content<br />
<br />
3. Constantly balance pvp content<br />
<br />
4. Constantly provide some of the best customer service any video game has ever had<br />
<br />
5. Constantly patch bug fixes<br />
<br />
6. Keep a website where we can bitch about all the stuff we never get cause its not fair I WANT MORE<br />
<br />
Seriously?<br />
<br />
They make billions. Here's what one billion dollars looks like: 1,000,000,000. That's a lot of zeroes and it's AFTER their costs. There is absolutely no way you can argue that they somehow need to charge for features which have traditionally been free and when subscribers already pay a premium subscription fee.<br />
<br />
It's called reinvesting. When something makes you money, you take some of that money and put it back into that product to make it even better.<br />
<br />
But hey, good luck with the whole &quot;entitlement&quot; catch phrase when even most fanboys are against this.</div></div><hr />

All I know is I will be jumping ship when the Star Wars MMO is out anyway as i'm pretty bored of WoW now.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">k1037</div><div class="date">2011-07-15, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh wait... The same monthly fee that hasn't gone up in almost 7 years. But i'm pretty sure the cost to run the game and for develoment stay the same huh?! Oh wait... Lets not raise the cost of the monthly fee, lets just something that only a few people might so we don't have to raise cost?! Oh wait...<br />
<br />
Costs have gone down.<br />
<br />
Bandwidth, server hosting, database management tools - they are all exponentially cheaper and faster than they were in 2005. I used to pay $100 a year for halfway decent web hosting of a single domain with a few GB's of bandwidth per month. Now I pay $200 a year for hosting over a dozen domains with a terabyte of bandwidth (and pennies for more) with crazy awesome automated database tools, burst usage, and other tech.<br />
<br />
Then there's the fact that gaming development is very much front-loaded. You code the engine and world-creation tools, create the bulk of the textures and skeletons, nearly all of the in-game tech - all at the start. From then on, it's much easier to add to the game. This is why game sequels are so common and can be churned out so much faster than the original games.</div></div><hr />

That's just ridiculous. A lot of people play this game to play with their friends, so charging money for people to do this is just irresponsible on Blizzard's part. It's not like we haven't given Blizzard enough money over the years.<br />

WHY should this feature (that actually costs blizz money in missing realm transfers) be some how &quot;included&quot; to what you pay per month?<br />
Because we pay Blizzard 15 dollars a month, and restricting us from playing with friends is bad for Blizzard and bad for the players.<br />
<br />
If I could play with my friends without having to pay an extra 15 dollars for a server transfer, I would still be paying my 15 dollar a month fee. Blizzard knows most people play this game for their friends, so restricting that is just baffling to me.</div></div><hr />

First of all, atm you are NOT allowed to play with your crossrealm friends, is this correct? (except BG:s and very very random rdf) But now they give you a CHANGE to do so... so please some one simply answer me HOW they RESTRICT it via method that ALLOWS you to play with your friends... It costs real money yes, but you are not FORCED to use it, nor it will not magically block your changes of finding your friends crossrealm dungeons and bgs if you refuse to use it. Still even if they launch this you have those choices not to use it and play with your friend with old ways aka. Transfer or reroll. I see no restrictions made here. So please stop using so stupid arguments about it being premium or not. I personally would love it to be free, but can't stand how people keep saying that this new feature (which intent is to help friends play together) some how restricts or completely prevents you to play with your friends...</div></div><hr />
