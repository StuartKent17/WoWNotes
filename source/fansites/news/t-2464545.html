Developer Interview - Ion Hazzikostas<br />
Ion Hazzikostas recently sat down with Vanion to talk about the state of the game and more!<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z8YhSMsXIW8&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
State of the Game<br />
<br />
The team cares deeply about the state of the game. They are visiting all of the different venues where players provide feedback and talk about the game and read all of the comments.<br />
People love the game and have a deep connection, but it's going in a direction they don't like, and that's frustrating. Feedback comes from a place of emotion. <br />
One of the challenges with WoW is that there are very diverse audiences and play styles. When players accuse the team of being out of touch, it isn't that they don't understand players concerns, or what they'd like the game to be. The team has to keep in mind the other half dozen groups of players that want the game to be different things, often opposing things. <br />
Players have every right to focus on their own experience.<br />
The team wants everyone to be as happy as possible. <br />
The internet is a place that has become a bit more polarized, and it's become more about getting anger out there and less about finding common ground.<br />
There is a bright future ahead, with the majority of Battle for Azeroth's patch content still to come. If you think back to this time in Legion, there was much more to follow.<br />
The team is focused on learning from mistakes that were made with systems and rewards at the start of Battle for Azeroth, correcting many of those in Patch 8.1.<br />
<br />
<br />
Progression and Catch-Up Mechanics<br />
<br />
It's important that progression and gear matter, but the team wants the game to remain accessible to people who are joining later or coming back. It's not just in the interest of those players, but everyone in a guild. <br />
Throughout Burning Crusade, guilds complained bitterly about having to go back and get people attuned and do content that was irrelevant to them. These hurdles made it harder to recruit and get into raiding. <br />
Patch 8.1 introduced catch-up mechanisms that were intended to get players ready for Battle of Dazar'alor. This initially felt like the game was giving you too much compared the current raid (Uldir). <br />
The team can probably do more towards having more guaranteed progression through currencies for Raid and Dungeon content. Conquest provides this gear track on the PvP side.<br />
<br />
<br />
Azerite Armor<br />
<br />
A lot of Patch 8.1 reflects lessons learned from the launch of Battle for Azeroth.<br />
There are still some fundamental flaws with the Azerite Armor system that the team is looking to pivot away from with Rise of Azshara. <br />
The team is happy with the system in terms of the customization it allows, but the progression of unlocking those traits was a mismatch with that customization system. <br />
Going forward, the team wants to keep armor fully unlocked and have a different avenue of progression in the Heart of Azeroth itself. <br />
<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
<br />
Legion focused on class identity as it was an important part of the story. <br />
The team tried to move away from mixing utility and throughput, as putting utility as an option against something that lets you do more damage isn't an interesting choice. <br />
The team has pulled away from talents that gave classes utility in an area that was traditionally weak for them. Someone has to be very mobile, someone has to be less mobile. <br />
Classes don't have too many abilities anymore, that isn't a problem they are trying to solve. The team is open to moving some talents back to baseline abilities where it makes sense. <br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 8.2<br />
<br />
In the next tier, the raid will probably open within a couple weeks of the patch. This time the raid opened later due to the holidays. <br />
The Crucible of Storms serves as a bridge between Battle of of Dazar'alor and Rise of Azshara. It may not open with the release of Patch 8.1.5, but probably not too long after that. <br />
The team is going to look at where the playerbase as a whole is at to set the item level for Crucible of Storms. It's only a 2 boss raid, so it may be slightly higher item level gear than Battle of of Dazar'alor. <br />
Mechagon is a second, smaller zone than Nazjatar, which is the main zone in Rise of Azshara. There is a megadungeon that is similar to Karazhan. Patch 8.2 will go on the PTR shortly after Patch 8.1.5 is live. <br />
The goal of Nazjatar is to learn from all of the past outdoor zones and improve upon them. <br />
<br />
<br />
Rares and Treasures<br />
<br />
The team would like to move back to a treasure system like Warlords that had a better story and rewards. <br />
There haven't been true Rare mobs since Mists. In a world where you can join cross-server groups, the right way to hunt for true rare spawns was server hopping. People would realm hop in Tanaan Jungle to find rares rather than moving around to find what's up. The team will be experimenting with rares in Rise of Azshara and beyond. There was something cool about finding a rare and being excited about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mage Tower<br />
<br />
The team was happy with how the Mage Tower worked out and would love to do it again in the future. They don't want to make it part of the expansion formula, it needs to fit the story and world.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warfronts<br />
<br />
Warfronts on live currently are Raid Finder difficulty. Heroic Warfronts will be closer to a Normal experience, tuned for a group that is coordinating together. It won't be a challenge for a Mythic raid group.<br />
No new Warfront is planned for Rise of Azshara. <br />
The Barrens Warfront was an early prototype and isn't currently planned. <br />
<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
<br />
The team is looking to improve crafting professions. <br />
The most successful crafting professions in WoW have been ones that create consumable things to sell, such as Alchemy or Enchanting. <br />
Blacksmithing, Leatherworking, and Tailoring have been the more challenging ones, as the gear they create competes with every other source of gear in the game. <br />
If you can get crafted gear that is better than raid gear, you don't really need to raid. If crafted gear is weaker than raid gear, then it is useless. <br />
Historically BoP items from dungeons and raids have been used. <br />
There is lots of room for improvement, including allowing you to specialize in certain Blacksmithing areas so that you are different or better than other Blacksmiths. <br />
<br />
<br />
Zone Updates<br />
<br />
Redoing older zones is a huge undertaking, but the team is always looking for a reason to do so, such as creating new content in those zones. It's unlikely that the team will update older zones over creating new ones, as it wouldn't be in the best interest of players. <br />
<br />

the notion that players only response are emotional is absurd, community have generated tones and tones of on-point feedback with very specific solutions, various solutions that all but very few have been ignored or rejected. Ion is literally saying &quot;we are the victims here&quot;, players are those who don't want to find &quot;common ground&quot; this is disingenuous and outright malicious lie.</div></div><hr />

Oh I know I have an idea.<br />

Let's make this currency called &quot;Justice Points&quot;. Basically you can buy let's say gear that will help with Mythic Dungeons/maybe a bit of Normal raiding. It caps at 2000.<br />
<br />
And let's make another one called &quot;Valor Points&quot;. Basically with this you can buy raid equivalent gear. However it should have a cap of 450 per week with a total cap of 2000.<br />

That's so stupid of him to say. The internet is the same as ever, if he wasn't shitting all over the game with his horrible decisions there wouldn't be mobs of people angry over his decisions. That statement just tells me that this idiot believes that the players are the problem and that he thinks he's in the right with everything he's doing.<br />

I don't know rick, He actually admits many faults from their part, and what he said about the internet being polarized, by no means is that &quot;we are perfect and they are attacking us!!&quot; but I guess if some people won't admit that there exist certain hate train with no stops to look at nothing straight to blow this shit! then yeah, they are right, the only thing Ion does in this interview is act as a victim and not assume any faults nor any disposition to change, a thing that if you read carefully and not only spout 50IQ &quot;He is a lawyer duh&quot; (the must dumbest thing I'm reading in the forums these past months) you will see that is a lie.<br />

<br />
Actually, he is the guy that has explained the thought behind the decisions they have made in the game's development. I do have to admit, that his explanations about directions they have taken in the game have made a lot of sense, even though that I do not like the direction, it still makes sense when they explain their thoughts.<br />
<br />
<br />
JEsus fucking Christ Ion needs to be fired ASAP. The devs are way out of touch. And this dip shit still thinks Azerite is doing well.<br />
<br />
What do you suggest them do? Scrap the system mid-expansion? Dont be so delusional, most of the expansion is based on it - they wanted to make thematic sets for each armor type, so they moved away from tier sets for each class and towards the azerite system, additionally it was a way to continue the &quot;artifact&quot; system from legion, because in games you always have to try to UPGRADE system but it does not always work out.<br />
<br />
What I'm trying to say is, stop complaining just to have your 2 seconds of fame. That is not useful, useful is to give feedback and constructive criticism with facts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;One of the challenges with WoW is that there are very diverse audiences and play styles. When players accuse the team of being out of touch, it isn't that they don't understand players concerns, or what they'd like the game to be. The team has to keep in mind the other half dozen groups of players that want the game to be different things, often opposing things.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is just not working. You can't have a product target SO MANY different people and think you can please everyone. You NEED to have a much, much more narrow target audience than now to build up loyal customers. If you want more people to play the game: Simply get them to be interested and join the target audience that actually cares.</div></div><hr />

What's it got? It depends who you're asking; it's entirely subjective isn't it?. <br />
<br />
I'm the filthiest casual there is, and I'm enjoying slowly levelling allied race alts and running WQs. I don't do any group content other than warfronts. And I'm having a blast. Ask someone else and they'll undoubtedly give you a different answer.</div></div><hr />

Not because I know better than the devs, but because I don't find the game design in BfA fun. Also what he says is that towards 8.2 the expansion will be in a better shape? Maybe at 8.3 it will be actually fun to play? Perhaps the way it should have released? So we have to play(pay)/skip two thirds of the expansion because for the final part it will be better.<br />
Also with no words of new Warfronts does that mean they realized they failed designing that feature and just drop it? <br />
<br />
Either way, yes I do love the game, but I feel completely unexcited about this design direction. 20 people of my guild unsubbed, we were 35ish active. There are tons of threads and discussions around the Internet about different BfA features, I haven't seen a single one where anyone argues things are great. The only thing that's great in BfA is the art, not even the lore because it's ridden with gigantic plot holes and obviously written by people who have zero idea about military strategy. If nothing changes for the better I'm out as well.</div></div><hr />

I prefer to go back and make people attuned than giving easy purple to make people instant raiders. At least we can practice in older content and feels a real sens of progression. Even if you have to do it multiple time on different characters. Today it's so easy to find a group with all the Tools we have, so why not bringing back some attunements?

<br />
I did have some nitpicks though:<br />
<br />
<br />
The team is happy with the system in terms of the customization it allows, but the progression of unlocking those traits was a mismatch with that customization system.<br />
<br />
I can see this in pvp, although many of the utility traits used in the arena tourney were busted OP. But outside of that, the traits are too dull to have interesting customization.<br />
<br />
<br />
The team has pulled away from talents that gave classes utility in an area that was traditionally weak for them. Someone has to be very mobile, someone has to be less mobile.<br />
<br />
I kinda disagree with this mentality. MoP was the expansion where every class was good at everything, and I loved it. I think it had the most compelling class design to date.<br />
<br />
<br />
The goal of Nazjatar is to learn from all of the past outdoor zones and improve upon them.<br />
<br />
Timeless Isle was the peak of world content for me. I hope they finally build off it with a new outdoor zone.<br />
<br />
<br />
The team was happy with how the Mage Tower worked out and would love to do it again in the future. They don't want to make it part of the expansion formula, it needs to fit the story and world.<br />
<br />
TBH I love solo challenges, and I would like to see some form of Mage Towers worked into the expansion formula.<br />
<br />
<br />
No new Warfront is planned for Rise of Azshara.<br />
<br />
This made me laugh. But I'm glad no more work is being put into Warfronts. They're fundamentally flawed and need to be brought back to the drawing board. Slapping a heroic mode on the current ones and moving on is fine with me.</div></div><hr />

Conquest provides this gear track on the PvP side.<br />
<br />
Oh I know I have an idea.<br />
<br />
Let's make this currency called &quot;Justice Points&quot;. Basically you can buy let's say gear that will help with Mythic Dungeons/maybe a bit of Normal raiding. It caps at 2000.<br />
<br />
And let's make another one called &quot;Valor Points&quot;. Basically with this you can buy raid equivalent gear. However it should have a cap of 450 per week with a total cap of 2000.<br />
<br />
:rolleyes:<br />
<br />
They'll have to call it something else and introduce it as a new and exciting feature in a future expac.<br />
<br />
The only thing certain with these devs is that they absolutely will not look back at the mass of data and experiments they've done over the years, find something that worked well and put it back in the game or keep it in the game.<br />
<br />
Every problem they &quot;solve&quot; every expac has been &quot;solved&quot; a dozen times in a dozen ways in the past and some of those solutions were actually well received, but they can't be assed to learn from the past and just design over and over, eventually repeating themselves with new names and new gibberish navelgazing as to how hard they &quot;thought&quot; about some bullshit &quot;problem&quot; that didn't exist until they made into one.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure the game will be FINE for many years to come but let's just be honest here wow is nowhere near where it used to be thanks to the &quot;directions&quot; the company has taken over the years. I'm not looking back with rose-tinted glasses on the past because I know the game has always had issues but I'm talking more about the LACK of players, the insane drop of players throughout THIS expansion by itself. <br />

The repetitive grinding was more than boring. The zones are too small. There aren't enough zones. Not flying until half way through the expansion is a bunch of bull. That doesn't make it harder. It makes it more annoying. Especially when people have bought multiple mounts from your online store. We're getting screwed. You've lost more than half of your subs &amp; people will keep leaving. We don't want to repeat the same boring quests every single week to make a necklace increase ilvl. You guys need to look back at WOTK, Cataclysm, &amp; MOP. Those were much better times imo. Most of the guilds I join break up after a few months because people get bored and leave for other games. Sure they eventually come back sometimes but they don't until new patches come out. Then they leave a few months later because of the boring grind. This is costing you a loss in revenue &amp; a loss of players permanently. These island expeditions &amp; mindless &quot;boss&quot; kills in Arathi are just a joke. Just more azerite grinding. Instead of adding more ways to grind azerite. Add more zones, add more dungeons, add more things to do in the world other than looking for azerite. Add more raids at a faster pace. Come on guys. If you are really listening then stop playing the victim &amp; blaming us for being upset. Yes we're upset. We're paying fifteen dollars a month to be bored. I've been here since Vanilla, left to go back to EQ2. I came back for BC and have been here ever since so I've seen the downfall of this game over the years. People I played EQ1 &amp; EQ2 have even stopped playing and it started w/Draenor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This right here is the issue. The focus shifted from making a good MMORPG to making people happy. The game became heavily casualized and a total joke. All the depth is gone. All the RPG elements are gone. Not only is the game as shallow as a puddle in the Sahara, but the guide websites like Wowhead and MMO-Champ make it even moreso.<br />
<br />
Making a good MMORPG is what will contribute to making people happy. Whether you like it or not the vast majority of players are likely more casual.</div></div><hr />

Well, the average players just leave when the game stops being fun. Four of my friends I started BfA with left a few months ago, saying that the game isn't fun in its current state.

Wrong. It makes perfect sense and they already do it. Mythic raids are for a small portion of the playerbase, and the same content is repurposed for the majority.

Don't get me wrong WotLK was good story Wise but for the rest, was known as the beginning of the downfall of Wow!<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, easy mode is when it began, I can agree with that. But the game still had a focus (Dungeons, raids and the PvP). Compare it to now when we have dungeons, raids, pvp, table missions, island expeditions, war front, pet battles, etc... they just seem to throw up a lot of ideas as of late and as we see in this expansion alone, Island Expeditions and War Fronts are being talked about pretty badly. :&lt;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pacster</div><div class="date">2019-01-28, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the point of the Lunar Festival: if you want all the seven new toys, you're going to have to either have a stockpile of coins from previous years or you're going to have to break out the alts. There are 150 coins worth of new items this year and you can only earn 84 per character each year. Time to break out those alts and run across the world two or three times.<br />
<br />
That's the reason I left the game at the end of last expansion. Instead of introducing something interesting or new we get recolors with ever increasing time sinks(everywhere, not just at seasonal events). If they slap it in their paying customers face that a paid designer has to spend MUCH less time on creating something than each player has to spend on getting it, then they don't need to be surprised if players get pissed. Dull, ever repeating and non-challenging grind IS work at the end of the day. We pay for fun...unlike their designers we are not getting paid.<br />
After pets and clothes their new lazy way is hearthstone-toys. We don't need more of it but that is not even the problem. The problem is that mass products like these need to be cheap. If they don't really put work into it then they should not expect players to do so. The &quot;if you don't like it or you would have to spend too much time, leave it and never look back&quot;-formula does not work with a lot of players...and Blizz knows that or they would not keep introducing time sink after time sink since the day they started to measure &quot;ingame time&quot; instead of paid accounts. They know the carrot on a stick and the social pressure of getting something that not everyone has is much, much stronger. <br />
Blizzard crossed my red line there long ago and it's getting more crazy and ot of touch with customers and reality with every expansion.</div></div><hr />

The team has pulled away from talents that gave classes utility in an area that was traditionally weak for them. Someone has to be very mobile, someone has to be less mobile. <br />
Classes don't have too many abilities anymore, that isn't a problem they are trying to solve. The team is open to moving some talents back to baseline abilities where it makes sense. <br />

I seriously have zero faith whatsoever in his ability as a game designer, reading shit like this. The most fun I and many others have had is from providing utility, and not just everyone doing the exact same amount of damage on average over all encounter scenarios.

Nothing in your little rant addressed my problem with your post. They don't always appear to be listening to feedback. They don't always make good decisions. The game is in an awful state right now because of it. <br />

But your post is essentially doing the same thing from the other side, and you don't even realize it. In your anger you aren't even listening to what HE said and made something up. That isn't any more helpful than what they are doing. That is what I am frustrated with in the community.<br />

Yes, I do love the game, which is why I haven't quit like the twenty people from my guild. We are few left and we all agree that if there isn't a clear steer away of the dull design we are seeing BfA will be our last expansion.<br />

When they say that:<br />
<br />
&gt;One of the challenges with WoW is that there are very diverse audiences and play styles. When players accuse the team of being out of touch, it isn't that they don't understand players concerns, or what they'd like the game to be. The team has to keep in mind the other half dozen groups of players that want the game to be different things, often opposing things.<br />
<br />
They mean casuals. The game is being made for casuals. There might be &quot;more&quot; of these people, and so going after that &quot;market&quot; sounds like a good plan in marketing theory, but they're not relevant to what makes a game good or not and this direction has had the effect of causing those that actually stay around months after launch to quit. <br />
<br />
Warfronts are just simply bad content, and increasing the difficulty won't make them any less bad. I'm still going to be running around collecting wood and iron most of the time. <br />
<br />
Not to mention they completely destroy any sort of sense of progression the game could actually have. What was it, week 3 and people were getting buried under welfare Warfront gear after so many people had spent the time to work on their characters? Just drowning people in gear is the actual problem and destroys all meaning of the game, pure and simple. Why raid, do M+, or do anything if I can just practically afk my way through progression like an entitled child? I can do just my warfronts and still walk away with a heroic raiding geared character by the end of the patch cycle.<br />
<br />
I don't even do Island Expeditions anymore they're just so incredibly unsatisfying to do.<br />
<br />
They even flat out said straight up that pruning the game isn't a &quot;problem they're trying to solve&quot;.<br />
<br />
This is who the game is being made to, bad players who don't seek any sort of improving of themselves to achieve anything, thus there's no reason to DO anything as there is nothing in the game that actually gives any sense of satisfaction back to the player. <br />
<br />
This &quot;improved communication&quot; has really only been just more dictating an agenda at all costs. Then they will blame the customer, or the marketing trends, or Trump, or whatever, when it doesn't succeed.</div></div><hr />

If you can get crafted gear that is better than raid gear, you don't really need to raid. If crafted gear is weaker than raid gear, then it is useless.<br />
Historically BoP items from dungeons and raids have been used.<br />
<br />
Idea... why doesn't crafted gear require BoEs from raid as materials?<br />
<br />
Like the raid may drop a 385 BoE that a leatherworker can turn into a 400 BoE by spending a lot of materials.<br />
<br />
It helps the economy by making the BoE market more active. It lets gear be good without cutting off raiding.</div></div><hr />

Let's not forget that many of the good things they've removed: Justice/valor, dungeons mattering, classes having a bit of depth, meaningful professions, scenarios, solo content that actually had some challenge (cant balance that with the current gearing system)etc... <br />

Well said. Given how successful the Mage tower was, I don't understand why they wouldn't make this a core feature at least once per expansion. Challenge modes, Mage tower, Mythic + pushing -- these are all great incentives for players to do solo or group content that is engaging, difficult and rewarding. Instead, you decide to reward players for doing mindless grinds?<br />
<br />
I thought the Legion systems were great. You did mythic raids and you received a once biweekly mission table mission that rewarded a piece of gear for the difficulty of raid you're actively engaged in. That's it. You could get Normal to Heroic level gear outside of that but it was clear who was doing mythic raids. Also, the class stories, profession quests and the like were all mire engaging than this watered down nonsense we have now. Which would have been acceptable if Island Expeditions were like challenge modes and War Fronts had a mythic difficulty.<br />

<br />
That's because it went from being what was essentially bad luck protection at the start to entire full sets of gear you could get. In TBC and even Wrath, you got pieces here and there, often seemed to be slots that were itemized different. That combined with Rep gear allowed progression for casuals but also a safety net for raiders. Yes there were those that complained, but most of those players didn't realize those things had always been there ( Rep gear and honor gear served this purpose in Vanilla often times).<br />
<br />
As far as BfA design goes, every single one of these issues he talks about was best to death in alpha/beta and they did nothing to address it. Class design, gear design, gear progression, etc. all of it was covered heavily and nothing was adjusted nor was there any real communication as to why the design was chosen. The moment I knew they completely missed the mark was when they had announced classes were done and then last minute started trying to throw out overhauls. It just said to me that someone had finally looked up from their work and let out a big &quot; oh shit &quot;. They've been trying to &quot; fix it &quot; since then.</div></div><hr />

There are a myriad of videos, especially the essay one that breaks down the issues perfectly. You even have Beluar talking about how out of touch it feels. <br />
<br />
If you try to make a game for everyone, ie. this broad audience that keeps getting mentioned -- you wind up making a game for no one. <br />
<br />
It's simple: stop trying to appease everyone and get back to the philosophy that made WoW great. Just look at the trend. As soon as you started with this accessibility philosophy towards the end of WotK, people started to drop off. Put back systems that allow player control, stop making things so complicated on how to obtain gear and let the desire come from seeing other powerful players. The fact that people can be as strong as a mythic raider by doing anything outside of raiding / achievement the most difficult content is extremely egregious.<br />
<br />
You nailed it. I came to comment but you said it better than I could’ve. <br />
<br />
It is an outrageous cop out.<br />
<br />
“Gosh, ppl mad! Too emotional!”<br />
BfA sucks that’s why people are angry. Take that, Ion, and improve the game. <br />

<br />
It was a great way to supplement your gear with a currency progression system, especially in the cases of bad luck. I remember several instances where I'd go an entire raid tier w/o getting upgrades in certain slots to drop in raids, but vendors offered a method to get a piece of gear.<br />
<br />
If anything, all the statements made by Ion in interviews recently point to a common theme: Blizz is adamantly against people getting end-game gear that isn't from instanced content, and I think that mentality is holding the game back. Professions like Tailoring, Leatherworking, and Blacksmithing would be the easiest and most logical vehicle for upgrading gear or crafting gear that is competitive with instance drops, but they're all but irrelevant right now. Every counter-argument I've heard from Ion comes from the extreme where no one would agree, like you can't have these crafting professions make relevant gear for raiding because we don't want you to craft all your gear and never need to raid... yeah, we know, no one is asking for that. Even if they did, so what? The current gearing mentality is that everyone can get to mythic raider ilvls, it's just a matter of time, and allowing crafting to make mythic raider level gearing for the player is just a matter of adjusting the time it takes to gather the mats.<br />
<br />
I'm really concerned that Blizz has become hyper-focused on mythic raiding being the end-all content for WoW with nothing on equal footing and one-dimensional end-game in general, and that's not going to make most of the customer base happy considering how small the mythic raiding community really is. Even when I was hardcore mythic raiding, I still thought it was rather stupid that armor crafting professions were so irrelevant and that there was only one path to BiS or comparable gearing as the game has aged. You could honestly just take out all the professions in the game, and there would be almost zero impact on the game.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MasterHamster</div><div class="date">2019-01-28, 08:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the challenges with WoW is that there are very diverse audiences and play styles. When players accuse the team of being out of touch, it isn't that they don't understand players concerns, or what they'd like the game to be. The team has to keep in mind the other half dozen groups of players that want the game to be different things, often opposing things.<br />
<br />
Or, try to choose your overall demographic? It's actually okay not to please everyone, since you CAN'T. WoW doesn't even know what it's trying to be right now.<br />
Stop trying to satisfy both drop-in-and-win ARPG and RPG players, because it isn't working. You can't keep the ARPG players happy and the RPG players clears everything too quickly due to your overarching FAST, EASY AND ACCESSIBLE &gt; all design-paradigm.<br />
<br />
WoW has always been accessible, no doubt about that, but it didn't try to be several genres at once. BFA is like an aberration that tries to be a grindy MMORPG and a Diablo 3 season at the same time.<br />

Something to keep in mind, most of the dev team was changed from MoP -&gt; WoD. And the new dev team has had a very clear and constant dislike of everything that came before them. Anything prior to WoD they will not go back to because they refuse to admit anything before they took control worked. So we wont get justice/valor back, we wont get what made crafting useful a back. We won't get reforging etc... Unless they get rid of a quiet a lot of the new dev team, nothing will be righted.</div></div><hr />

He directs the game so he has a massive role. I am sure those above him say something like, Keep the players playing longer.

<br />
That's true, but it's dismissive to stop there. It also comes from a place of experience, observation, and reason.<br />
<br />
<br />
The internet is a place that has become a bit more polarized, and it's become more about getting anger out there and less about finding common ground.<br />
<br />
This is an incredibly tone-deaf statement, given the fact that the expansion has been based on and pushing polarized conflict, and especially when one of the main characters involved in that conflict is a dev-favorite who also happens to be a genocidal maniac.<br />
<br />
I would *love* to see how Ion explains how the current WoW story &quot;finds common ground&quot; between the members of the player base. They've created a narrative where the Sylvanas Rabid Fanboiz hate the Saurfang Loyalists and hate the Anduin Fans and hate anybody who rightfully calls out the monstrous actions happening. Hate hate hate hate, that's all the narrative right now has produced.<br />
<br />
The current storyline has DIRECTLY CONTRIBUTED to the polarization of the game's player base. Avoiding that plain and easy fact is pathetic, to be honest.<br />
<br />
<br />
People would realm hop in Tanaan Jungle to find rares rather than moving around to find what's up.<br />

Yikes. That's all I can say about that.<br />

<br />
The team is looking to improve crafting professions.<br />
<br />
And yet they seem to fail continually? Here's some EZ tips that will improve professions dramatically: Let profession make craftable leveling gear that helps people fill out slots, in case they choose to level in an alternate fashion. Let professions make mounts that DONT REQUIRE GRINDING THROUGH MYTHIC DUNGEONS OR RAIDS. It should be a REWARD for getting profession capped that uses ENTIRELY GATHERED MATERIALS, not another punishment/chore. Let professions make STARTER EPICS so that a well-stocked and prepared crafter with alts could kit out a new level-capped character with gear that will make transitioning into raids/mythics easier. STOP MAKING PROFESSION MATERIALS SOULBOUND. JUST STOP. JUST STOP. EFFING STOP IT RIGHT NOW. Account bound? Fine. Soulbound? No, you don't stop at Go, you dont collect $200 - you go directly to jail.<br />

<br />
It's hilarious to me. They've been going on and on about &quot;conversations&quot; with players, then just ignore feedback and do what they want. There IS NO COMMON GROUND, because the Devs, starting with ION, have not CREATED ANY. He's just using more buzz words and word salads to justify his and his team's decisions, and blaming the reaction on the players. <br />
<br />
You can't decree things from your Ivory Tower, ignore feedback, not talk to anyone, and go radio silent for weeks on end, and complain about &quot;common ground&quot;. <br />
<br />
If Brack does anything, the minimum should be tell Ion &quot;No more interviews or Q&amp;As&quot;, and find someone in their company who can speak to the public and not insult them like this, and put their foot in their mouth every time. Ion is doing a disservice to his game, and his company, with these obnoxiously blowhardy observations. <br />

I know WoW isn't something they consider worthy of future investment, but they're greatly underdelivering even when it comes to keeping it at status quo. With this kind of neglect, the game is going to die much sooner than it should.<br />

Yep. He seems to be taking the Azerite failure really personal.<br />
still expecting the neck to basically be a rework of the legion weapons with talent tree.<br />
fact heal blink is back with Fire mages already, suspect most of the removed legion stuff will return.<br />
<br />
I was always &quot;meh&quot; about Ion, but then he made the comments about the Beta forum feedback<br />
which sadly wasnt the last time he came across as totally detached. No people on all the beta forums gave amazing detailed posts<br />
and nearly every issue currently facing the game they knew about. Ion basically said it was hard to get detailed feedback<br />
when hundreds of people are telling them Azerite just isnt working and then he wonders why people are angry?</div></div><hr />

Point #1- So? Do you mean that raiding is solely for getting better gear and nothing else? You mean that people that like to craft and crafting can't get the best gear?! They HAVE to raid? <br />
Point #2- No shit Sherlock. That's always been the source for the best gear. <br />

Honestly, WOW professions have always been a joke. They would be better just to roll them all into one crafting Profession and one gathering profession. Let everyone do both. That's how bad crafting is right now.</div></div><hr />

I'm not in the loop anymore because I don't raid but I've heard M+ trinkets are better than raid trinkets.<br />
<br />
<br />
There was something cool about finding a rare and being excited about it.<br />
I don't know about you guys but I don't get excited about rares. If a rare has a 4% chance to drop what I want from them then it's not exciting when I see them it's &quot;I hope they drop it&quot; and if they don't it's &quot;I hate this&quot; and if they do it's &quot;I'm glad I don't have to do this anymore&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you can get crafted gear that is better than raid gear, you don't really need to raid. If crafted gear is weaker than raid gear, then it is useless.<br />
Make gear that has a purpose besides throughput. You could make xmog sets with models exclusive to the profession. Or gear with some kind of utility like craft speed gear. I know I'd buy craft speed gear on my scribes since it takes literally 30 minutes when you are mass crafting. I still love my Chef's hat. I would stay away from making gear that affects performance though. Don't make any CD/damage reduction gear or any &lt;element&gt; resist gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are absolutely no verifiable reports on the size of the crew working on BfA and live updates. But what can be verified is that *actual* output. And we are getting: no class updates, numerous barely modified copies of Legion systems, admissions that Kul Tirans take a lot of work (they do, but if the team was the biggest ever that wouldn't be a problem), a huge disconnect between words and action when it comes to islands/warfronts/azeroth armor.<br />
<br />
The reality is that they are having trouble delivering. That's not emotional. That's fact. Blizzard has always been a slow studio - but the current rate of production strongly hints that there simply aren't anyone working on many aspects of the game (class mechanics especially). Never before in the history of WoW have classes as a whole been left to rot for this long.</div></div><hr />

A lot of Patch 8.1 reflects lessons learned from the launch of Battle for Azeroth.<br />
No you didn't, you just continue repeating this every patch/expansion<br />
The team is happy with the system in terms of the customization it allows, but the progression of unlocking those traits was a mismatch with that customization system.<br />
Proves a previous statement.<br />
Legion focused on class identity as it was an important part of the story.<br />
It didn't, rather &quot;against-class&quot;, and first statement been double proven since now.<br />
Warfronts on live currently are Raid Finder difficulty. Heroic Warfronts will be closer to a Normal experience, tuned for a group that is coordinating together. It won't be a challenge for a Mythic raid group.<br />
Yeah! go-go-go with another thing with million difficulties, and first statement been proven third time!:rolleyes:<br />
It's important that progression and gear matter, but the team wants the game to remain accessible to people who are joining later or coming back. It's not just in the interest of those players, but everyone in a guild.<br />
And you still (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2464630-quot-Catch-up-mechanics-quot?p=50788407&amp;viewfull=1#post50788407) don't (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2464630-quot-Catch-up-mechanics-quot?p=50787956&amp;viewfull=1#post50787956) know (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2464630-quot-Catch-up-mechanics-quot?p=50788241&amp;viewfull=1#post50788241) how to do it proper way.<br />
People love the game and have a deep connection, but it's going in a direction they don't like, and that's frustrating. Feedback comes from a place of emotion.<br />
you don't say :) (https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/masonry/000/264/594/0a9.jpg)<br />
One of the challenges with WoW is that there are very diverse audiences and play styles. When players accuse the team of being out of touch, it isn't that they don't understand players concerns, or what they'd like the game to be. The team has to keep in mind the other half dozen groups of players that want the game to be different things, often opposing things.<br />
The team wants everyone to be as happy as possible.<br />
man... again (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2463918-Tides-of-Vengeance-Season-2-Live-Developer-Q-amp-A?p=50773923#post50773923)! World's system and structure are important in first place, and people are supposed to do what they can do best - to adapt themselves, but if former doesn't amenable to any healthy logic and world retreats from its rules to please players, it's here where vicious circle (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2464627-Ion-is-an-out-of-touch-coward?p=50787535&amp;viewfull=1#post50787535) begins.<br />

This way older tiers can remain relevant to guilds/players who never cleared it in the first place, and maintain a sense of progression.<br />

No thank you, not everyone has as much time as you and others do, and to be always able to progress in the latest raid and not having your guild rush you through content that they don't want to do anymore (and some of them don't have the time also) is one of the few things they have changed that are good.<br />

And the Dev team, I think in some cases they are indeed listening, but sometimes for the most important things It seems like they don't want to, we see that with feedback for azerite in beta and they are fixing it in 8.2 not for 8.0, and other things. Oh well, at least the raiding, art and music team are still doing a great job, the second raid is awesome.</div></div><hr />

I agree with the straw that broke the camels back, though i think it almost applies to the whole industry right now. That said, even the most loved expansions had lots of bugs.

This right here is the issue. The focus shifted from making a good MMORPG to making people happy. The game became heavily casualized and a total joke. All the depth is gone. All the RPG elements are gone. Not only is the game as shallow as a puddle in the Sahara, but the guide websites like Wowhead and MMO-Champ make it even moreso.<br />
<br />
<br />
What he wanted to say is &quot;The team wants every activision chairman to be as happy as possible with our projections&quot; . <br />

<br />
True.<br />
I'm dreaming about challenging group zones that will drop not items, but rare materials tradable only to the members of the group that was there, and mush be forged in special places inside the dungeon, while the rest of the group must fend the crafter from increasing violent mob attacks. <br />
This, with much more diverse crafting recepies and possiblilies (opposite with the simplification of everything now) - more possible attributes like resistance, boosting combat run-speed, and many more, which will demand different items for different challenges. <br />
<br />
Not that it will ever happen.<br />
Ion will make his usual blah-blah, everyone happy, and by the will of his Activision masters, will keep cattering for those that demand instant gratification and top-loot without effort.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If we are on the BWL patch no catch up is required<br />
On the AQ patch make it so you can skip MC<br />
On the Nax patch make it so you can skip BWL<br />
<br />
Too much catch up mechanics just frustrates existing players, you work your ass off for several weeks to get gear and then someone comes along a month or so later with a patch and is handed what you worked hard for with zero effort, thats not good, its even worse when they do the SAME content and get better gear.<br />
<br />
You also have the problem that players dont have anything to do , i am not surprised if you give them the ability to skip all the content a few months after it comes out.<br />
<br />
What is so bad about working up to a goal anyway ? Its not as if it will only be you, many many players will be in the same situation.<br />
<br />
This will also let you remove some levels of difficulty from the game that just make the whole thing a mess quite frankly.<br />
<br />
The stupid azerite system simply does not work at all. You should not have to lose a trait you like when you get new gear. The gear that drops should unlock that ability for use via the neck and then you get to keep it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As much as people want it to spin it this way, the community being toxic and less nice, is not 100% fault of blizzard, as much as the random guy in League of Legends that starts being unpolite just because you are owning him.<br />
<br />
Everyday I have less and less faith in humanity, as much as the dev team are failing, to lose all rationality, ask someone to be fired while insulting them is just... so sad that the human being is so... small, to the level that some don't even realize that because of a video game they are insulting ans saying stuff that... damn, they need some fixing. And is not that they are not right, because they are, it's the manner and how they talk...<br />
<br />
Example from this thread, and this is one of the soft &quot; 'Feedback comes from a place of emotion.'. Gee, YA THINK, Ion? I'm so glad you finally learned what emotions are. Grats.&quot;<br />
<br />
And the Dev team, I think in some cases they are indeed listening, but sometimes for the most important things It seems like they don't want to, we see that with feedback for azerite in beta and they are fixing it in 8.2 not for 8.0, and other things. Oh well, at least the raiding, art and music team are still doing a great job, the second raid is awesome.<br />
<br />
You're assuming I raid mythic. I'm suggesting they split the playerbase in order to design a full experience without having the resort to ilvl scaling and without having to deal with the massive ilvl inflation. It would benefit everyone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh no I'm not even taking mythic into account, since my guild progress normal then HC. The problem with having to re-clear uldir for you to do the new raid is that you will be left behind, or you find pugs for uldir or you find a guild that wants to help you clear uldir for you to gain Ilvl, and then you can go to the new raid.<br />
<br />
To think in a solution for:<br />
<br />
-Not inflating ilvl<br />
-But also you progress and feel more powerful<br />
-and give the players something from the new raid that makes them do it apart from new bosses.<br />
<br />
That is hard, I'm thinking it this way &quot;I've beaten uldir so I'm more powerful than before and I've paved the way for others, This new raid will make me more porwerful&quot; I agree that every patch &quot;negates&quot; the time you spend gearing to defeat the raid and be more powerful, but the way I see it every patch is like a mini expansion but the diference is that I don't have to lvl up and my stats won't scale down from that, so I will become more powerful and my dps/healing/tanking will be better.<br />
<br />
It was fun going into emerald nightmare geared with HC ToS, made me feel more powerful, yeah, I could achieve that also if I waited for the argus patch... But it won't feel the same having that ilvl because of catch up than while the content was more relevant, as it don't feel the same, doing ICC now that you &quot;outgear&quot; it than during it's prime.<br />
<br />
I know my opinion is not the most popular, I completely understand every player that hates it, but the way I see it, my character evolves and it ends up being a beast at the end of the expansion, I like it :S<br />
<br />

<br />
But what if they designed it in a way where you don't have to &quot;re-clear&quot; uldir for a new tier even if you have new raiders, but a group starting fresh still had to progress?<br />
<br />
I get the problems that used to exist, but blizz has this habit of using a nuclear bomb solution for so many things. WoW is not the game that got them their playerbase in the first place.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">therealbowser</div><div class="date">2019-01-29, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Back in BC and Wrath I enjoyed paladins. They had like 9 lives! Then Blizz catches on and suddenly we have 2, one which you just stand there.<br />
<br />
So I switched to Hunter. I could lock you down in PVP! Stun city and a slow death. Blizz put a stop to that by removing my hunter abilities. Wholesale melee combat removal! WTF<br />
<br />
Warlock... OK. Welp here comes Demon Guys... taking your skills.<br />
<br />
You enjoyed Paladins when they were broken, once they are no longer broken, they are no longer fun. Fair enough, I guess? I mean I miss reckbombing players from 100 to 0; once I could no longer do that, I was kind of disappointed, too.<br />
<br />
You enjoyed hunters when you could dominate players. Okay. But what I don't get is your complaint about melee abilities. Hunter melee abilities really sucked. They were removed and replaced with ranged attacks at any range, even removing your deadzone entirely. And now you have a melee spec, which few hunters take advantage of anyways... lol...<br />
<br />
The real highlight of this post is complaining about warlocks. Demon hunters literally took a single ability away from warlocks; metamorphosis. Sure, this in turn changed up demonology a bit, but it's not a big deal. Demonology for a time really sucked but it wasn't because of a lack of metamorphosis, it was because of the 'demonic empowerment dance' which is no longer a thing. IMHO demonology, mechanically at least, is in a good place right now and has gone back to its roots -- being the pet spec. It sounds like you were playing warlocks for the wrong reasons.<br />
<br />
What it sounds like is that you really liked metamorphosis, so instead of complaining about its removal, you probably should have just rerolled demon hunter once it became available. Personally, I welcomed the change on my warlock because it made demonology fun... or at least, aside from the demonic empowerment nonsense. Again, now that that one grave error is fixed, I'm completely happy with them. <br />
<br />
Warlocks have 99 problems, lack of metamorphosis is not one of them. :cool:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Class synergy and flexible spell choices had more ways for players to tune and find a play style that they enjoyed.<br />
We had tokens to help those unlucky players that never got the drops they wanted.<br />
The tokens also allowed &quot;causal&quot; players to also progress their gear to enable them join groups and raids to get even better gear through drops.<br />
Reforging allowed player to further tweek gear to better match their play style.<br />
World bosses that were fun to hunt and fight for.<br />
The last expansion that didn't treat flying as a method to nickle and dime players.<br />
<br />
There are many more examples from expansions up to and including MoP of systems that allowed players to have fun in the way they wanted to play.<br />
<br />
I want to believe that WoW can change back into a game that I want to play, but I believe that with the current dev team and the management WoW will continue to tell me that I am having fun the wrong way.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">oathy</div><div class="date">2019-01-29, 10:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The team is focused on learning from mistakes that were made with systems and rewards at the start of Battle for Azeroth, correcting many of those in Patch 8.1.<br />
A lot of Patch 8.1 reflects lessons learned from the launch of Battle for Azeroth.<br />
No you didn't, you just continue repeating this every patch/expansion<br />
The team is happy with the system in terms of the customization it allows, but the progression of unlocking those traits was a mismatch with that customization system.<br />
Proves a previous statement.<br />
Legion focused on class identity as it was an important part of the story.<br />
It didn't, rather &quot;against-class&quot;, and first statement been double proven since now.<br />
Warfronts on live currently are Raid Finder difficulty. Heroic Warfronts will be closer to a Normal experience, tuned for a group that is coordinating together. It won't be a challenge for a Mythic raid group.<br />
Yeah! go-go-go with another thing with million difficulties, and first statement been proven third time!:rolleyes:<br />
It's important that progression and gear matter, but the team wants the game to remain accessible to people who are joining later or coming back. It's not just in the interest of those players, but everyone in a guild.<br />
And you still (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2464630-quot-Catch-up-mechanics-quot?p=50788407&amp;viewfull=1#post50788407) don't (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2464630-quot-Catch-up-mechanics-quot?p=50787956&amp;viewfull=1#post50787956) know (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2464630-quot-Catch-up-mechanics-quot?p=50788241&amp;viewfull=1#post50788241) how to do it proper way.<br />
People love the game and have a deep connection, but it's going in a direction they don't like, and that's frustrating. Feedback comes from a place of emotion.<br />
you don't say :) (https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/masonry/000/264/594/0a9.jpg)<br />
One of the challenges with WoW is that there are very diverse audiences and play styles. When players accuse the team of being out of touch, it isn't that they don't understand players concerns, or what they'd like the game to be. The team has to keep in mind the other half dozen groups of players that want the game to be different things, often opposing things.<br />
The team wants everyone to be as happy as possible.<br />
man... again (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2463918-Tides-of-Vengeance-Season-2-Live-Developer-Q-amp-A?p=50773923#post50773923)! World's system and structure are important in first place, and people are supposed to do what they can do best - to adapt themselves, but if former doesn't amenable to any healthy logic and world retreats from its rules to please players, it's here where vicious circle (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2464627-Ion-is-an-out-of-touch-coward?p=50787535&amp;viewfull=1#post50787535) begins.<br />
Players have every right to focus on their own experience.<br />
You don't know what that mean, do you? (https://www.khwiki.com/images/thumb/c/c2/Hector_Barbossa_-_Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_%282003%29.png/300px-Hector_Barbossa_-_Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_%282003%29.png)<br />
The internet is a place that has become a bit more polarized, and it's become more about getting anger out there and less about finding common ground.<br />

Its brilliant seeing what he said just taken apart with common sense.<br />
If he really believes all his own statements BFA is going to be a very long painful expansion.<br />

agree totally, Mop the Classes really had fun.<br />
This still is the core issue I have they can add 100 new races but if the Classes/specs need work nothing will change.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Queen of Hamsters</div><div class="date">2019-01-30, 01:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are absolutely no verifiable reports on the size of the crew working on BfA and live updates. But what can be verified is that *actual* output. And we are getting: no class updates, numerous barely modified copies of Legion systems, admissions that Kul Tirans take a lot of work (they do, but if the team was the biggest ever that wouldn't be a problem), a huge disconnect between words and action when it comes to islands/warfronts/azeroth armor.<br />
<br />
The reality is that they are having trouble delivering. That's not emotional. That's fact. Blizzard has always been a slow studio - but the current rate of production strongly hints that there simply aren't anyone working on many aspects of the game (class mechanics especially). Never before in the history of WoW have classes as a whole been left to rot for this long.<br />
<br />
It is emotional though, not fact. In the decade that I've been playing, class overhauls didn't happen in patches and I felt that my class(es) were &quot;left to rot&quot; plenty of times.<br />
<br />
I'm inclined to believe that if they suddenly laid off chunks of the developers working on Legion, there'd be word about it. Until such a time, what I've seen in-game (zones, new models, quest content, raid content, warfronts, Island expeditions, dungeons etc etc) does in no shape or form support the hypothesis, regardless of how I feel about my class and the content on offer. <br />
<br />
If compared to say, WOTLK, Cataclysm and yes, even MoP, there's a massive difference in content delivered now vs back then before the crew grew. Even if BfA doesn't match Legion in design decisions.<br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;We have five public-facing teams: Overwatch, Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, Diablo, and World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
Each one of those teams is between a hundred and three-hundred people.<br />
<br />
Now, as usual people will then make the assumption that the lowest number = the WoW team, but it stands to reason that simpler games (that don't require world building etc) have the least amount of developers, no? Or the games not having development done to them?<br />
<br />
As I said, if they suddenly had laid off huge swats of developers from WoW despite record sales, we'd know. So until further notice, the only canon is the image showing off the team from 2017.<br />

<br />
Since Legion raised the bar, it's quite funny to see what people now consider to be a &quot;lack of content literally!!!!!&quot;...<br />
<br />
BfA had basically no class changes at *release*, and some classes (shamans, shadow priest) were promised fixes in updates that then didn't come. This is not the same situation as the usual &quot;big changes only for expansion pre-patch&quot; that you correctly describe as the norm. Post-Legion we've seen a noticable halt in class development. Across the board. This isn't just a single class or spec being left to rot, which you also correctly describe as the norm.<br />
<br />
100 people would be a very small team for a game like WoW. This is coming from someone who has a background in the games industry. Looking at the actual names on the credits for BfA and other Blizzard products - we can see that there is a lot of rotation going on. The engineers are not simply assigned to one team. And this is mostly an engineering/QA issue.<br />
<br />
Lack of content is not the primary problem with BfA. While it does have more shallow and rushed content (imo) than Legion, the primary problem is a lack of mechanics/systems development. Classes are not being updated/fixed/kept fresh, core expansion systems are half-baked, systems carried over from Legion have a noticable lack of iteration and refinement - etc.<br />
<br />
This is not emotional - it's my analysis as a developer. You may disagree with this analysis, but that doesn't make it an emotional statement. The emotional part is that I as a customer and gamer feel taken advantage of. Legion was a strong expansion, and I cut Blizzard a lot of slack when it came to BfA, and believing they would have a strong post-launch effort. They didn't - and that makes me disappointed and feeling somewhat tricked into buying an inferior product.<br />
<br />
They absolutely have not laid off developers - they're having trouble filling open positions, so that would be insane (except for any culling of the overpaid and/or underperforming). But they're spreading the developer they do have thin. I suspect Classic is sucking up far more resources than they're willing to admit - as are the higher number of games compared to 10 years ago. A picture of the developers is useless, as it doesn't tell us anything about what other projects these people worked on - and it mixes low-pay, high-supply roles with high-pay, low-supply roles. Blizzard (and many other studios) has a serious problem attracting and retaining strong talent in some roles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I get the problems that used to exist, but blizz has this habit of using a nuclear bomb solution for so many things. WoW is not the game that got them their playerbase in the first place.<br />
<br />
hmm a way to do it would be to not increase the ilvl gain from the tiers at all, but that would mean not increasing the max ilvl in all of the expansion, that's the first thing I can think, but I don't like, my character would not feel more powerful over patches.<br />
<br />
They could also ditch Ilvl and do it in another way... but I can't think of any, and if they remove ilvl the shitshow would be Nuclear.<br />
<br />
I'm in for whatever ideas people got or blizzard does, until one day I'm not having fun anymore, then I would check until I'm interested again. I unsubbed in 7.2, got bored. When 7.3 came to the PTR I regained my interest and did ToS until 7.3 came out. I loved Argus and spent hours with some friends farming rares and stuff.<br />
<br />
If nazjatar in 8.2 is better, then, I'll pour quite a lot of hours into the game, well and there is a smaller zone apart from nazjatar, mechagon, and the new dungeon. In this interview Ion said that the raid tier would come very soon after the patch (useful information there), so with 2 new zones new raid and new mega dungeon, that patch will have some fun hours with my guild.</div></div><hr />
