Blizzard is finally increasing the gold limit when transferring characters (https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/character-transfer). Soon (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20742714163#5) you can move 250,000 gold! Faction change limits don't appear to have been increased according to the support article (https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/596).<br />

[Feedback] Guardian<br />
Basically I love the aesthetics and overall design motif for Guardians in legion. But I really don't love the ability rotation. Unbelievably simple, no choice, no optional complexity, and almost impossible to execute incorrectly.<br />
<br />
I can't imagine pressing X -&gt; Lacerate for 6-8 minutes on a boss. I would be unbelievably bored.<br />
We'll likely tweak those talents now that Thrash (Lacerate) stacks take longer to apply. Exact details still TBD. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/401781-feedback-guardian/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20419283872?page=6#112))<br />

Balance Affinity - Moonkin Form (21154)<br />
As of Build 21154, Moonkin form granted by the talent Balance Affinity does not currently enable the usage of Starsurge or Lunar strike.<br />
This should be fixed in the next build. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/402624-bugbalance-affinity-moonkin-form-21154/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20742724094?page=1#2))<br />

[Feedback] Mistweaver<br />
Essence Font, as mentioned, should already not be too weak (roughly matching Vivify) when there are 5 targets to heal. But that might not be enough to make it interesting in a 5-player setting--we can move some healing from the HoT to the initial heal to shore it up there. It's possible the HoT causes the spell's use to be poorly messaged, even though it's quite a large heal on 5-6 targets (the aforementioned change would make it closely comparable to Wild Growth). If tinkering with the numbers doesn't succeed in making its usage intuitive, a cooldown is an option in lieu of the HoT--but that would reduce its flexibility, and the current advantage it has on large numbers of targets (and its uniqueness as well).<br />
<br />
While there's been a lot of positive feedback on Rising Thunder, I've seen a lot of intimations that it's overpowered (usual caveat that tuning should not be the foremost concern at this stage regardless). I'm curious if this is based on evaluations of the talent that are 1) in the absence of artifact traits affecting Thunder Focus Tea, 2) after the nerf to Renewing Mist, and 3) taking into account the mana cost of Rising Sun Kick. Any theorycraft on RT in those conditions would likely by the most useful.<br />
<br />
I don't think I've seen much theorycrafting on RT without the TFT traits. Typically when most of us talk about things it's either all traits we can access or none of them, and on this build you can have both Dancing Mists and Harmony and Focus which enables a kind of silly ReM spam that in turns allows a ton of buffed Vivifies. These aren't really relevant in playtesting because 5 mans don't have enough people for those ReMs to add extra targets.<br />
Right, sorry, &quot;without the TFT traits&quot; meant &quot;without any traits&quot; would be fine too. Just want to isolate discussion about RT from the interactions with Celestial Breath and Focus and Harmony.<br />
<br />
Rising Thunder is overpowered in a talent-selection sense that it blows Focused Thunder out of the water (one extra TFT'd spell per 30 seconds or an extra TFT spell even before artifacts.. basically whenever the hell you want) as well as Mana Tea (mana savings of TFT-Vivify).<br />
That's the question--does it so obviously dominate Focused Thunder, when it's the gain of 1 TFT buff every 30s, at the cost of 3 GCDs, a nontrivial amount of mana, and a range requirement.

Holy Priest Synergy with Holy Word<br />
I would say our biggest difference philosophically is that we're not so sanguine about the state of Holy on live, which relies on using Renew to drive Sanctuary, to the exclusion of most other modes of healing. For one, it does not seem especially versatile or varied--most of the synergies/rewards (more CoH casts and more WoM procs) are relatively passive/smart effects with little player interaction, simply results of casting as many Renews as possible. Also, a heavily Renew-oriented rotation is not very appropriate for Holy (essentially, their gameplay should not be so similar to Resto Druid), and it's intentional that the direct heals are more in the forefront in Legion. Renew is available as a reasonable option when an instant or slow top-off is convenient, but is not positioned to be a primary workhorse of the class.<br />
<br />
Heal and Flash Heal are somewhat on the strong end of analogous spells across the healing classes. It is possible that buffing them in terms of cost, instead of buffing their heal size as we recently did, would help the rotation flow more smoothly. While Holy Priests do have to get used to a more mana-limited world on alpha like everyone does, being able to fill with the basic heals consistently is intended. Similarly, PoH did suffer a loss in some situations from its targeting change (which we felt was necessary), and we'll keep an eye on it. There's some concern that it could get too attractive or self-working to spam in raids, since it does use smart targeting now.<br />
<br />
More generally across all healers, the pace of healing spell use is intentionally being slowed down from the current world of overly abundant mana (as has been discussed elsewhere), so you may have to realign your expectations somewhat of how frequently you can use expensive heals or large heals. Especially so in the context of Holy Words, which justify their unusual strength by having cooldowns that are meaningfully long. It should not feel anything like the regularity with which you press CoH in Warlords--you should expect to typically have situations where a Holy Word is not available and won't be available in time to solve the healing need that's presently at hand.

[Feedback] Demonology Warlock<br />
A heads-up for Demonology Warlocks about a change you'll see in today's build:<br />
<br />
Summon Inquisitor was changed into Summon Dreadlord. We've been exploring different options for what demon for this talent to summon, and it happened to be on Dreadlord when this build was made.<br />
<br />
However, internally, it has already changed again, and in the next build, you'll find that it has become Summon Beholder, which shoots Eye Lasers. Please base feedback on that, instead of the briefly-lived Dreadlord. Thanks!<br />
<br />
RIP Dreadlord. But shouldn't we already have Beholder via the Supremacy glyph to Felhunter?<br />
That's what we call the &quot;Observer&quot;. The &quot;Beholder&quot; in this case is a demon you've seen very rarely, most notably Durumu.

That way you can transfer millions and just vendor them without loosing any gold, well considering you get them by flipping cards :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Were you really committed to keeping hunter pets for buffs? They seemed to shuffle them several times every expansion. Who even gives a crit buff now? Spiders? Hyenas? Who did they shuffle the heroism buff to? Nether Rays? Do scorpions still disarm? <br />
<br />
If there had been some specific diligence paid to maintaining &quot;pet ability identity,&quot; maybe it'd make sense to raise a huff about them.</div></div><hr />

Does that cap affect guild transfers? If not create a guild 7 days before you transfer and load that sucker up with all you have.</div></div><hr />

That's a silly workaround to have to use all things considered. As others have said, the cap is far too low. Especially considering you're paying to transfer the character. If you're paying to xfer a character it should just move everything with that character. There is literally no logical reason to restrict it.</div></div><hr />

Animations are smoother than the current raptors and the tail doesn't whip around as fast. I still have issues, though. There's no strap around the neck to help keep the saddle forward so chances are it'd just slide backward thus rubbing the raptor's legs (realistically speaking). For two, the feather locations makes it look like a badly shaved poodle. The feathers on the body are okay, but on the legs and arms? I was expecting something like the archaeopteryx, not something that's half mottled. It looks shabby. Thinking about it, it looks like we took a baby that was mottling its baby feathers and threw a saddle on it rather than waiting until it fully mottled and became an adult. Blizzard and animal cruelty with Legion. It's a reoccurring trend it seems. My last issue is the baby pet version and the adult version. Why does the baby have teeth but not the adult? That only shows the baby is a reskin of the existing raptor pets. Babies are often born without teeth and get them later (unless they're reptiles and fish where they're born with teeth and have teeth as adults), but you never see a baby with teeth and lose them as an adult. Blizzard couldn't even mildly modify the pet version to remove the teeth.</div></div><hr />

You of all people, being the cynical lord of the forums, should at least know that the cap is in place to stop gold-sellers from moving vast amount of stolen gold at once.<br />

They can't mate. The way the game was designed made it impossible to change your gold amount due to the 32bit integer.</div></div><hr />

They changed that when they raised the old cap in Cataclysm to 1c below a million.<br />

0 to 4,294,967,295 is the range or an unsigned 32 bit integer. Or -2,147,483,647 to 2,147,483,647 for a signed one. Just a little bit larger than 1,000,000.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2,147,483,647 -&gt; 214,748g 36s 47c (i.e. the old gold cap)<br />
<br />
2^32 -1 is no longer a constraint. Clearly they found a workaround and have chosen 999,999g 99s 99c as the new arbitrary limit (takes 34 bits to store). Yes, you can probably just concatenate numbers together to make them store larger values or whatever.<br />
<br />
I've seen tons of level 1s on fresh accounts on Horde Stormreaver-US recently selling the same 270k worth of (undoubtedly) duped pets over recent months. Clearly they're trying to get lots of gold to sell or do whatever with.<br />
<br />
IMO Blizzard should implement a tiered system where achievement points yield a higher transfer cap. In other words, discourage dupers/scammers/etc from just buying a 100 boost to move 250k between servers. If you're a legitimate player, it seems reasonable to be able to move all (or a lot) of your wealth at once if you are transferring servers to raid or play with friends.</div></div><hr />

Hunters already give buffs so instead of hunters giving EVERY GODDAMN BUFF they now give a few just like every other class.<br />
Not sure how this is a bad thing, fecking making every class the same is what made the game shit in the first place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hunter pets bringing a buff was started because hunters were not being brought to raids because they were dps only and were set down in favor of a class with a buff. Blizz is simply reverting pets to what they used to be. I do wonder, though, if we will still have to be BM to have an exotic pet or if MM can have an exotic pet now. I do hope they don't take the heal away from exotics.</div></div><hr />

is there any point at all in the EU alpha forums? just let us in the US instead?<br />
Yes, absolutely. We read it all. Just easier to respond on US forums. Assume you'll see responses, regardless of where they are? (Celestalon)<br />
<br />
Because having two different accounts (or even one universal one as a Blizzard dev) open on different tabs is fucking rocket science. This has to be one of the laziest excuses for ignoring EU forums I can think of. There is littrally no reason for not having all the forums merged in such a way that people can post to any region they want like they can with Diablo.</div></div><hr />
