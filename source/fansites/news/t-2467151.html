Corrected an issue preventing the Keystone Master achievement from being properly awarded.<br />

Battle of Dazar’alor<br />

Jadefire Masters<br />
<br />
Visual distinctions have been added to the Multisided Strike clones in Heroic and Mythic difficulties.<br />

Event<br />
<br />
High Overlord Saurfang heard a rumor that someone has a Love is in the Air surprise for him, and will risk coming out of hiding to receive it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
The movement speed reduction from Everchill Anchor (https://www.wowdb.com/items/165570-everchill-anchor) is now correctly treated as a Snare effect, and can now be dispelled as a Magic effect.<br />
Heart of Azeroth<br />
<br />
Ephemeral Recovery (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/267886-ephemeral-recovery)'s cooldown now correctly persists through immunity effects.<br />

Assassination<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue that caused Poisoned Knife (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/185565-poisoned-knife) to remove your non-active lethal poison that was applied by Shiv.<br />
Resolved an issue that caused Neurotoxin to increase the duration of school lockouts caused by interrupt abilities such as Kick.</div></div><hr />
