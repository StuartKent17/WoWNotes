Seeing as the announcemend for payed character custom was first it would be sligtly lame if previous deathknights have to do that to get access to the new skin tones / facial features.</div></div><hr />

Also I love how they gave Wild Growth a 6 sec cooldown only because it's big brother, CoH, needed a nerf.<br />
Wild Growth already had severe limitations due to it's HoT nature and retard-smart targetting, now it's gonna be an even more useless spell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If they're going to remove SpellPower, why don't they add in some other stats, like Int? I thought the reason the spellpower was so high was because the weapon has no other real stats for healers.<br />
<br />
Pallies will def. want to get the one from heroic nexus, the one from PVP or from Naxx now, because Int is so valuable, and if they have the same spellpower, they are definitely better.<br />

Also, looking at the stats of the weapons that are being nerfed, i think there'll be a tiny amount of difference, as the other stats aren't super high either, so there can't be much difference....people really should just wait and see before making so many replies about how it's completely game changingly unfair!

It was either a cooldown, or the removal of the smart healing component. I rather take the cooldown, instead of a spell which just targets by proximity to the person being targeted by COH. <br />

No, those points were not added :-) They are in that particular database field, but neither points (nor descriptions, apparently) are used in-game for any of the statistics. In essence they are dead database fields, probably copy&amp;pasted. They did not change from the last release either (otherwise they'd be colored green or red on that page) :)</div></div><hr />

The steady shot nerf is the ridiculous nerf, they either don't intend to put them on the patch notes will add it in later as the PTR goes on. For example, CotW is most certainly getting nerfed no doubt about it.<br />

What in the WORLD is a Little Fawn's Salt Lick?!<br />

A Fawn is a baby deer. A salt lick is a stone covered in salt that farmers/herders attach to fences as a sort of 'candy' for various cattle animals. <br />
'Little Fawn's Salt Lick' hence will probably be such a stone that can summon your personal own baby deer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Basically if there is no corresponding nerf, this has just increased the dps of frostfire specs by ~15%.* I'm a raiding mage and I'm not happy with this.* There is no reason for this change.* They say they are nerfing hunters but then take the next highest dps class (frostfire mages) and buff our highest dps spec *considerably*.* This is *not* small, this is gigantic.* <br />
<br />
I really hope this change is recinded.* The change to Arcane makes sense since it doesn't buff our dps, just gives us more options to do the same dps that we're currently doing.* The Frostbite change has got to go.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And now (if the info is correct) FFB gets -0.5 sec cast time when using Frostbite talents making it so FFB spec blows fire and arcane totally out of the water.<br />
<br />
Tbh, lets be fair, that change alone is gonna be nerfed sooner or later cause FFB now is alry very powerfull imagine it with reduced cast time.<br />
<br />
But then again, they nerf hunters cause they do too much dmg but warriors do too and they remain untouched...<br />

<br />
No not going to happen..... We hunters are all retarded and pets are meant to get bugged during boss fights, not following the hunter off a ledge and instead running all the way around causing aggro on all uncleared mobs, taking the long way around in arena so that when they finally get to the target you are dead, not attack a target when you tell it to attack, attack a mob while on cower, using COWER right after Growl causing the mob to chase the Hunter when COWER WAS TURNED OFF.<br />
<br />
Rapid Fire having no effect on the rate your gun fires 90% of the time.<br />
<br />
everything about hunters is bugged or doesnt work and we get a NERF? wtf fix shit correctly then worry about nerfs. Some of us would like our class to be at least working and we may not be so harsh when the word nerf came around.<br />
gg bliz as always. Focus on balance and other class QQ before you actually pay attention to things that are more important.<br />
How about those locks? They need some fixes also and I bet they have just as big of an issue with their pets pathing.<br />

What I don't get is why Demonology locks are getting nerfed. They are the worst spec for PvE and they got nerfed. I'm confused, UNLESS they are really buffing the pets by a huge margin or something like that, that's the only real reason why they would do this.<br />
<br />
And love the Chaos bolt damage buff, it used to be a glorified incinerate, at least it's not now. And THANK YOU for fixing the bug with Backdraft! It supposed to affect GCD other than just clip a 1.4 incinerate which is a DPS loss by all means. I hope with this, Destro can go back and compete with Affliction.

A new mailbox is now available at the Crows Tavern in the Dalaran Sewers.<br />
We have added over 60 new graveyards to Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms.<br />
The run speed in spirit form has been increased by 50%. Night Elves in Wisp form will now move at 75% speed. <br />
PvP<br />
# Arenas<br />
<br />
All rage and runic power are set to 0 when an Arena begins and the preparation period is over. <br />
<br />
# Battlegrounds<br />
<br />
* Lake Wintergrasp<br />
o Wintergrasp Commendations can now also be purchased for the low low price of 9 Wintergrasp Marks of Honor. Players can visit their respective Wintergrasp vendors and put those Marks of Honor to use!<br />
o Elementals should now always despawn when the battle begins.<br />
o Wintergrasp now extends further south so that more revenants can be reached.<br />
o There are now three ranks in Wintergrasp: Recruit, Corporal, and First Lieutenant.<br />
o Players will be eligible for participation rewards after two honorable kills.<br />
o Players will receive increased honor with increased rank.<br />
o Players will receive additional Marks of Honor at Corporal or higher rank.<br />
o Players will receive corporal rank at 5 honorable kills instead of two. <br />
* Strand of the Ancients<br />
o Antipersonnel Turrets will now gain vehicle immunities, use falloff damage, and damage increased to 4000 + 200 per level to compensate for falloff.<br />
o Seaforium charges have been moved closer to the graveyards on the 2nd tier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like the line &quot;Players will receive additional Marks of Honor at Corporal or higher rank.&quot;<br />
<br />
I think Wintergrasp is a lot of fun. But I am finding it very hard to get marks. We have a very avid Horde side on my server, and wins are few and far between. Also combine that with the fact that you cannot 'grind' wintergrasp and its very hard to get marks. This should act as a nice balance for it.<br />
<br />
If you were to play an AV or a strands game you are looking at 1-3 marks every 15-20 min. Wintergrasp games run ever 2 1/2 hours (I think). <br />
<br />
Based on your buff at the end of the game I would think that each level would grant an increase to 1/3, 2/6, 3/9.<br />
<br />
That would make the most sense to me, and that would also fit in nicly with the &quot;Wintergrasp Commendations can now also be purchased for the low low price of 9 Wintergrasp Marks of Honor. Players can visit their respective Wintergrasp vendors and put those Marks of Honor to use&quot;. Spend 30 min in Wintergraps, fight your heart out, win, and you can get 2000 bonus honor. Seams good to me!</div></div><hr />

You hit the nail on the head. There are so many bugs with the hunter class that desperately need to be addressed. Having experienced every single one of those problems you've described on a regular basis, I'm getting ready to reroll and relegate my hunter to farming duty once he's at 80, especially with the ridiculous nerfs being imposed.<br />
<br />
While using AotDH yesterday (with Improved AotH 5/5), I had the Rapid Fire proc ONCE. ONCE!!! That was after playing through the entirety of level 76. And it only proc'd when I was messing around in Elwynn Forest and one-shotting mobs.<br />
<br />
My pet bar disappearing in the middle of a boss fight (typically after Heart of the Phoenix) is unacceptable. Blizz's solution being, /resetui is BULL (and making macros to deal with Blizz's poor coding isn't a solution either). You cannot do that in the middle of a boss fight, and you lose a significant portion of your dps (Focused Fire, The Beast Within), healing abilities (Spirit Bond) as well as your group dps (Ferocious Inspiration, Call of the Wild). Not to mention the loss of an off-tank, or emergency tank if things go badly.<br />
<br />
How about the massive targeting issues? When I have a mob targeted and tell my pet to attack, and it goes and chooses a completely different mob, the system is broken. <br />
<br />
How about the mob/pet chase scenario? When I tell my pet to attack, it goes for the mob and they run after each other, typically aggroing more mobs which can result in my death (if I'm solo) or wiping completely (if I'm in a group).<br />
<br />
How about all the broken vehicle quests? If I don't remember to dismiss my pet before getting into a vehicle, go up to a mob to start pew pew, but it won't work because I didn't dismiss my pet, I end up dying and that is unacceptable.<br />
<br />
How about all the bugged bosses and elite quest mobs, how about all the stuck evade bugged mobs, how about the all the bugged areas that make my pet get stuck (and include many stuck evade mobs)... like the murloc outpost in Borean Tundra?</div></div><hr />

Right on..... Wintergrasp my pet bar disappears and the UI has to be reloaded every 2 min or my pet stays out of control... My character icon disappears at random times in a raid so I cant leave the raid.<br />
I understand bugs, but please* fix known issues before you nerf a class already having major issues.<br />
<br />
If we didnt have these issues I could probably keep #1dps, but with all these problems I am usually 4th. That has to say something... When I have no bugs during a Heroic or raid I can reach #1, but 75% of the time I'm down to 4th.<br />
So we out DPS other classes during the 25% when we are not bugged...... This calls for a nerf?</div></div><hr />

Anyway I think its fair to give druids cd on WG (i play a resto druid) at the same time priests get theirs since WG is not nearly as much effective healing as CoH so therefore its much more nerf for priests. This changes will make aoe healing definetly harder and probly boost shamans effective raid healing as well.</div></div><hr />

You obviously dont play a hunter or even understand the bugs we have which really cripple us.<br />
Let just one of the bugs I mentioned earlier happen during a boss fight or raid and you can kiss our dps goodbye. <br />
unlike you other classes we have to sit there scratching our head trying to figure out how the hell we can make it through this fight til we can reload our UI or log. Like I said.... maybe just MAYBE we are not bugged 25% of the time and we can out DPS other classes, but there will always be a #1 DPS this is blizzards way of saying screw hunters we dont want them hitting #1. We are crippled with bugs and now nerfed.... Its gg ur a Huntard for rolling a Hunter.<br />
<br />
No one wants a Hunter arena partner, Why? Because of every reason I have listed.<br />
we are a laugh, a joke, made out to be silly children who just dont understand the class.<br />
Rets bitched about all their nerfs, but there we're no threats or posts of BAN's as Ghostcrawler pointed out yesterday about banning us Hunters.</div></div><hr />

Why don't you try rolling a hunter and leveling it before spouting nonsense you have no experience with?<br />
<br />
Personally, I use around 14 commands in a single boss fight (no macros). If things get bad, I can end up using around 22. Playing WELL as a hunter involves a whole lot more than standing back and spamming steady shot.</div></div><hr />

Why nerfing priest and druid??? who is first in healing in 25man raid? Holy palat. Who have 150% over healing in same raid palat? Who need nerf??????<br />
<br />
This is in more then 70% guild.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually in most of our raids Druids are #1 in healing followed by CoH priests then it flip flops between Pallies and Shaman for the next few spots.<br />
<br />
They have stated many times that Shaman are supposed to be the AOE healing champs. At this point we are below Priests and Druids due to the mechanics of Chain Heal. It is a smart heal but only affects 3 targets (4 when glyphed) and the effect is reduced by 25% on each hit. WG and CoH does not have this mechanic. CoH and WG were so powerful that they designed encounters around the assumption that they would be used. Making it nearly mandatory to have those classes.<br />
<br />
Priests have far more spells at their disposal than Shaman. This is the strength of Priests.<br />
Druids have the mana efficiency and the ability to keep people topped off with their many HoT spells. Shaman have one talented HoT on a six second cooldown.<br />
<br />
It's not any class at fault for the nerfs. It's Blizzards fault for not realizing the power of WG and CoH.</div></div><hr />

I believe he was talking about BM,but they dont realize that all BM has is Steady Shot....<br />

MM requires getting in the action and using combos. (It's not just steady shot) I hardly ever use SS in my rotation as MM... maybe one to two times until my instant's are back up.</div></div><hr />

I have a hunter as a matter of fact, and while he isn't my main, he gets quite a bit of play time and while the bugs do happen, not nearly as much as you say they do.<br />
<br />
And guess what? Judgement's are bugged, ignite is bugged, probably plenty of others. You aren't called huntards because you're not designed, you're called huntards because 9/10 people who are retards roll a hunter. Doesn't mean 9/10 hunters are a retard, but it does give them a better chance than most other classes.<br />

If he isnt your main you dont put near enough time into it to realize the bugs when they happen. Say what you wish, but everyone who actually plays a hunter and has him higher than lvl 20 knows what we are talking about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Topping charts in Battlegrounds is totally different than in PVE. Get your facts straight please before you try making points. Hunters didnt have an issue with topping the charts in PVE unless they we're totally geared for it. The issue bliz now believes it see's is Hunters dont have to be well geared to top the charts. While this may be true to some extent and a nerf might have been needed, none of us would feel so bad about the issue if the class actually worked. No one wants to carry a bugged hunter through a raid, nor do we want to play one.<br />
<br />
It would be the same if any other class was bugged near as bad and being nerfed. Why all the QQ over top DPS? Do you feel you can't DPS enough? I dont care about being #1 DPS. It makes no difference to me if I was last, but the bugs rip us a new one in PVP in a case which we are already crippled. I can see it already..&quot;Hey guys... guys... hold on a second I gotta reload my UI... plz dont attack us yet I'm bugged.&quot; Yeah that will work out great.<br />
<br />
We dont need to see everything &gt; hunter 1v1. I know bliz has stated they dont care about 1v1, but in a 2v2 or even 3v3 situation we bring the team down.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Also since you are a noob hunter level it up to 80 and try some arena..... then meet me back here and bitch about it with the rest of us!&lt;/b&gt; Try the 2 new arena's as a hunter and see if u can keep a partner.</div></div><hr />

It's an undesirable effect in PvE because it knocks mobs out of the radius of other class's AE spells, as well as makes it a pain for AE tanks to keep agro on all mobs. This glyph allows the Shaman to go in Thunderstorm and Magma Totem (or FN Totem), AE, get some mana out of it, and get out - without messing up AE for the other DPS and tanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought 1 stamina gave 10 health. So in the end, you have the same amount of health.<br />
<br />
There are some differences between having just plain health or having stamina of course, and maybe there is a nerf there? I don't see it though. I even thought Stamina was better. <br />
<br />
<br />
Since stam is affected by talents and buffs (kings?) then I would think it would be better than straight HP as well... but I'm not a tank, so I dun know &lt;.&lt;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lichbane</div><div class="date">2008-12-12, 03:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So is there any reasoning behind the Reflective Shield nerf? Is it really that good? The answer is no. Its not that good and didn't need to be addressed.<br />
I agree. There is no need to nerf reflective shield at all. Apart from the fact I used to get massive amusement from whacking the shield on everyone and everybody and watching Warlocks wither from damage of their own dots reflected back to them. However it's not terribly efficient and only really fun in PvP.<br />
<br />
As for PvE, this has not even been vaguely powerful enough to register on anyone's radar. Let's face it ... Disciple is the red-headed stepchild of the healer trees. They are only marginally less pathetic than BM hunters are now.</div></div><hr />

BM Hunters are still going to be the top DPS Hunter spec after the changes, you realize. So I guess your statement is pretty accurate, Discipline Priests are in fact only marginally less pathetic than an awesome class/spec combination.</div></div><hr />

Well maybe because it was abused as healing spell because dispel is cheaper to cast? 600 health is laughable, tell that to miners with toughness. Besides it's bonus in ADDITION to your dispel, so please quite whinemoan and glyph differently then for all I care.</div></div><hr />

Glyph of Levitate ftw :D<br />

Nah, seriously, the Shadow glyphs are good imo, but the Mind Flay glyph should be a 10yd increase with no penalty because every single class can avoid/break the &quot;slowing&quot; effect someway or another.

well we wont be using it except in aoe situations anyway, and the combo of 3.5 sec CL and crazy magma totem is kind of OP'd for aoe. <br />

you'll never use CL for single target now regardless. with the new talent, LB outscales CL at a very early spelldamage/ haste ratio, and its 1/3rd the cost. hell atm , my lightning bolt does more damage AND dps (yes i'm aware of the cast speed dps adv chain lightning has), simply because i'm running 30% haste and 2500+ spell dmg.</div></div><hr />

No glyph as in no glyph that's good for Assassination spec, or is it no glyph for Mutilate ability?<br />

<br />
So true. I make a steady income by selling certain glyphs but I never bother to make or sell priest glyphs becasue they are so crappy. Mage, pala and som other glyphs sell like crazy becuse they provide a significant buff to an ability without nerfing another. Like the glyphs for mages, they just plain add nice buffs to their core abilities without taking anything away.<br />
<br />
Seriosly, everyone should just take a look at all the glyphs in the game and see for themselves how unfair this really is. Some classes get great glyphs while others just get gimmick ones.</div></div><hr />

This being for a class that has dedicated heal spells, both in and out of Shadowform. Don't see that happening for some reason.<br />
<br />
Mages get bandages if they take the profession, 60% channeled heal if they take the glyph, and pots/HS/etc if they take other people and consumables. Priests can throw on VE/VT for mana regen, and if needed, drop out of SF and heal.</div></div><hr />

I have played competitive gaming (mostly fighters) all of my life. Traveled, made my money and lost it as well. And I seriously will go out on a limb to say that this is by far one of the worst codings/balance in a game ever.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that hunters are totally underpowered. Cause honestly, we can put down in mean dmg. It's just comical that vs. a paladin it's pretty much an auto-loss...... which has gotten old real fast. Yet that class continues to get free upgrades. lol. I swear, any paladin that bitches about their class not being powerful enough is a straight up joke. And has no clue how to play this game. <br />

They have a class that wears plate, can run faster than others, slow you down, double stun, HUGE crits, plus spells, can heal themselves, and oh... BUBBLE. i don't know how them having every good ability in the game isn't the #1 thing talked about...... <br />
<br />
Now we get a viper sting nerf? rofls, that was the only good game we had (IF a paladin didn't cleanse it) to drain their mana to MAYBE live out longer to beat them. lol. <br />
<br />
Hunter's will NEVER see a good rating in arenas unless a group carries them. So much broken game play mechanics and so little time or care anymore to explain them. I'm def re-rolling another class. I suggest the same for the other hunters. keep your hunter on the back burner and maybe in 2015 blizzard might give us a god damn hand out. til then I recommend rolling 1 of the 4 op classes.<br />

<br />
Anyway those warrior changes are sick. I mean I was doing pretty well as fury without those changes. Now I will be able to change some hit for crit/haste which should result in more dps...<br />
I am worried that after this (in my opinion) injustified buff we will see some nasty nerf :P<br />
<br />
<br />
They will never nerf warriors. The head of Blizzard right now is in love with warriors. They won't stop until warriors are the most powerful class in the game by leaps and bounds, so you have nothing to worry about. All the hunters they just ass ended can take comfort in re-rolling warriors.</div></div><hr />

It will be just fine for single group healing. It will be ok for 10 man raids. In 25 man raids it will start to suck, but you should have at least one healer for each group for most encounters anyways. The only place that it will hurt is possibly the healing meters which is doubtful because no it will actually be able to land because the priest won't be spamming COH over it.</div></div><hr />

Why nerfing priest and druid??? who is first in healing in 25man raid? Holy palat. Who have 150% over healing in same raid palat? Who need nerf??????<br />
<br />
This is in more then 70% guild.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If your paladins are top in 25 mans for overall healing then your druids and priests SUCK. Enough said. Paladins land larger heals, but they do it as quickly or as often as priests (no group heal), and that makes it much easier to top the meters with a druid or priest.</div></div><hr />

So be it. But please please please fix that cower bug which includes prowl and claw for my cat. Happy to see my Demo lock will not be any worse than he is now. The toughness thing for mining looks like a nerf to me maybe it isnt. Also I don't see the change to bloodsurge on my fury warrior as a buff. I liked the 100 percent chance for a free slam on a bloodthirst crit. Whatever the case may be,I'll still play my hunter,lock and warrior and enjoy it. Well maybe not my hunter so much,unless they fix the crazy bugs. Meantime maybe I should roll a pally. It's the only class I don't play lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Titansteel Helms now all have a blue and a meta gem socket. Some of them also got their stats changed/reduced. (Spiked Titansteel Helm, Tempered Titansteel Helm, Brilliant Titansteel Helm). As a reminder the spell power on Titansteel Guardian has been reduced from 490 to 457.<br />
<br />
Merry Christmas<br />
<br />
Also the nerf to the priest and druid aoe heals is not a big one. Sure its a big play stlye change for priest but really not so much for druids. With that being said... Damn you all may have to actually try and heal instead of blindly spamming CoH all day. The one class in the game without a good aoe heal are paladins and yah we make due. So get over a simple 6 sec CD. did you all forget prayer of mending and prayer of healing both huge spells that priests tend to forget in a raid. I am pretty sure you priests will make it through this &quot;horrible&quot; nerf. <br />
<br />
And hunters wow... just wow all through this game i have always seen equal gear hunters within the top 5 in raids and pvp for dps. all this entails is trying a little bit more when you play. I do realize that hunters have tons of bugs but i have never seen a hunter (that knew their class) massively below any other dps class in any pve situation. &quot;NEVER&quot; and i have been raiding and playing since the release of this game.<br />

Thanks, feel free to flame me all you want <br />
