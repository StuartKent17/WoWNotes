Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Can you talk about mobility creep in games, not just League as I’m seeing games like Overwatch, WoW, Dota2 etc with like hyper agile heroes that completely dumpster the immobile one because they can just dodge any of their damage out put and dish out a fair amount of their own. Why not make everyone mobile<br />
In my experience it keeps happening because mobility (especially high-speed windowed mobility) is fun. As a player, it gives you a lot of interesting decisions about initiating a fight or running away from one. You can get to where you need to be quickly or get out of what you need to get out of quickly. Movement can help band-aid some bad decisions you made a few seconds ago. I think it’s totally natural that almost every game ends up with a mobility creep problem. But then as a designer you catch yourself. You don’t want to go add mobility to every character, because that’s just admitting defeat that there aren’t more attractive mechanics out there than mobility. So you get a little stubborn because you know you’ll come up with something… someday. I also think it’s the case that even when a slow-moving character is demonstrably viable or even stronger than the fast-moving character, that players still opt for the fast-moving character. Humans like to go fast. (Source (http://askghostcrawler.tumblr.com/post/153497793073/can-you-talk-about-mobility-creep-in-games-not))<br />
<br />
About the PvE aspect of lots of online games, especially big MMOs, do you think that there is a window of opportunity for a competitive PvE scenario? Maybe a monetized scenario like the most financially successful PvP ones?<br />
I think competitive PvE is a hugely unexplored space. We did live raids for awhile at Blizzcon (though they were a logistical nightmare) and even did a race a couple of times.<br />
<br />
If I was working on a group-based PvE game (I’m not), I would try and figure out how to make it competitive. I would try and figure out if it could be an esport. There are several sports that are compelling to view (for some folks!) where the opposing sides don’t directly interact much: golf, bowling, track and field, most races. Those kind of feel like the live equivalent of competitive PvE. (Source (http://askghostcrawler.tumblr.com/post/153843080888/about-the-pve-aspect-of-lots-of-online-games))<br />

<br />
OW sites in general aren't really needed. it's not a game that really needs guides. PVP is dynamic and always changing and everything is situational, especially in a game that lets you swap on the fly. D3 is more static and content on a site can be more meaningful and last longer. It also involves more long term strategy from experts that people are actually going to look up on a website. Leveling for a new season. New season builds, etc etc.</div></div><hr />

It isn't the OW site, it is Overpwn which is run by the same company as MMO-champ.<br />
<br />
The issue isn't that OW is a flop, it is that people don't use Overpwn, they have better alternatives and Overpwn wasn't able to catch a lot of attention. Overpwn was never on point like MMO-champ, people never had a real reason of going to it, most OW players come from other video game companies so they don't even know MMO-champ/overpwn was a thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A lot of MMO's have better lore then WoW, WoW is just better at portraying it in game. <br />
<br />
SWtoR- Way better lore, better shown in game, actual game blows a large one though. I play this for the lore.<br />
<br />
GW and GW2- Lore is better then WoW, they are consistent and the story makes sense. Issue is hard to understand in game, it isn't really shown. Though I find the lore easily better then WoW when I started to wiki everything.<br />
<br />
Those are the MMOs I have played with better lore. I have not played a good variety of other MMO's but I bet some are out there.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have researched a lot of Warcraft lore as I have been a fan since WC2. <br />
<br />
Kosak started in Cata, this is right around the time WoW lore took a nose dive, the story went all over the place. WoW had good lore, now it has somewhat went off track and a lot of lore seems poorly done up until now.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Queen of Hamsters</div><div class="date">2016-12-05, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">... You people are aware that &quot;good lore&quot; is entirely subjective, right? It's not like you people analyze it on some level above how you feel personally about it...<br />
I for one have played many MMORPG's, among them GW2 and SWTOR, and couldn't give less of a fuck about the lore in those games. WoW's lore = I care about, so it has the best lore of all MMO's out there to me.<br />
<br />
And lol @ the &quot;sinking ship&quot; retards resurfacing. It's not as if that's been said for years yet Blizzard (and WoW) is raking in more cash than ever. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Overpwn was being managed by the same guy who runs Hearthpwn, and he didn't seem that interested in maintaining it. On top of that the site was failing to gain traction, in part because of neglect (almost no Blizzcon coverage) and in part because more popular alternatives exist.<br />
<br />
They could bring in someone else, but it apparently wasn't a paying gig anyway, or they didn't see a path to making the site turn a profit.<br />

Man, that bit about Argus sounds really disappointing. Why does it have to be another broken ruin corrupted by fel magic? That is such a tired concept.

Agreed. I wanted Argus to at least maintain a facade of beauty, in keeping with Kil'jaeden's status as &quot;The Deceiver&quot; and his nostalgic tendencies, since its his seat of power more than anyone's. If we don't get at least a glimpse of a pristine Argus I'll be really bummed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're also the reason blizzard games has expansive lore. I don't dismiss people just because of occasional missteps with writing, when they overall did a good job. As for laughing stock, anything that is popular gains a following that feels then need to ridicule it. Even in the early days WoW had this clique.</div></div><hr />

No. Just... no. If it's too hard to beat with a PuG, find a guild with raid times you can make or wait until everyone out gears it to such a degree that PuGs can do it.

Anyway if people want to know why the lore is messed up more than before look no further and point all fingers at the side-comic/book writers who just love trying to insert their own mary-sue into the game.<br />
<br />
Then point the rest of the fingers at the post-merger team because they're pathetic and lazy.<br />
<br />
At least Med'an never made it in-game.<br />
<br />
Also Ion once again using his lawyer &quot;skills&quot; to deflect blame onto the playerbase.<br />
<br />
All the new content in 7.1.0 is overtuned and/or the loot isn't high enough to justify the difficulty. They ALREADY broke the 15-ilvl rule and even nerfed LFR rewards. Everyone out-gears everything now, ESPECIALLY with relics/artifact.<br />
<br />
I'm tired of hearing news about people leaving or swapping departments. I wanna hear news about these post-merger hacks getting canned.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nicode</div><div class="date">2016-12-05, 09:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Man, that bit about Argus sounds really disappointing. Why does it have to be another broken ruin corrupted by fel magic? That is such a tired concept. Eredar are at the highest levels of the Burning Legion, they are an advanced intelligent race. There is no reason why Argus has to be in ruins and broken. It could still be a paradise of pristine architecture and refined life. It should be. The Eredar should have received something for their Faustian deal with the figurative devil. They should have retained their high culture. I was so looking forward to Argus. Ever since I heard that Draenei talking about the beauty of Argus in that Death Knight starting zone.<br />
<br />
Now I expect just another ugly slab of black rubbish with green snot. Like I have seen so many times in WoW.<br />
<br />
I agree with this so much. This is one of those aspects of WoW lore that's weak upon even the smallest inspection -- bad guys need a reason to be bad. And, even if the classic Metzen-brand &quot;I NEED MAOR POWAH&quot; Warcraft reasons is part of it, that's just not enough for the average bad guy. Agrus should be a fantastic world, a pinnacle of technology and culture where all Eredar want to be -- even if it's the heart of the Burning Legion. <br />
<br />
Blizzard always paints themselves into a corner with bad guys who want to blow up the universe just for the sake of blowing up the universe, themselves included. Whether it's Twilight's Hammer or the Burning Legion it just doesn't make sense. Okay sure maybe Deathwing and Sargeras want to blow it all up because they're crazy, but you won't get a billion followers of your crazy cult if the end reward is death.<br />
<br />
Blah blah, hopefully with Kozak and Metzen gone they will hire someone with worldbuilding and storytelling skills. But probably not.</div></div><hr />

Sinking ship = The most success MMO in history that will most likely not be surpassed in the next 100 years in terms of revenue, sub count, and overall success. <br />
<br />
Sinking ship = Still at least 4+ million people subbed, which would be a wet dream for any other company and deemed a huge success. <br />

I don't even play WoW anymore, haven't for years but let's not get stupid here with the doom non-sense.</div></div><hr />

Although I don't play the game anymore, I had always thought Argus would be a corrupted, decadent version of its former self, a bit like you'd expect Zin Azshari to be at its pinnacle. The Eredar certainly seem to enjoy luxury and opulence, yet they seem to simply be the elite tier goons of the Legion now, rather than its ruling caste.</div></div><hr />

Legion is nearing a point in player activity that will put it BELOW warlords of draenor at the end of WoD.<br />

... You people are aware that &quot;good lore&quot; is entirely subjective, right? It's not like you people analyze it on some level above how you feel personally about it...<br />
I for one have played many MMORPG's, among them GW2 and SWTOR, and couldn't give less of a fuck about the lore in those games. WoW's lore = I care about, so it has the best lore of all MMO's out there to me.<br />
<br />
And lol @ the &quot;sinking ship&quot; retards resurfacing. It's not as if that's been said for years yet Blizzard (and WoW) is raking in more cash than ever. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
I am sorry. But, good writing is NOT subjective.<br />
<br />
Kosak is the moron who stated that Uldum was the best written zone in Cata. He was very bad at his job.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mostly Kosak. WOD was all him. Yrel, Grom getting the victory lap after starting the war, etc. <br />
<br />
This is great news. Kosak, while probably a nice enough guy, just can't hack writing at this level.<br />
<br />
The worrying thing is - who replaces him?</div></div><hr />

Yes but its not Wows or devs fault. This game has been around for so many years that even those who love it got already tired with it. How many times can you eat your favorite ice-cream before you get bored of it? Even though Wow is still very nice to play (and with big, cool changes in Legion) for old players its not exciting or new anymore. Nothing can change that, no new design or class. I would even say that Wow managed its aging very well in comparison to many other games, which are already forgotten.<br />

I think its personal to decide which zone is favorite for one. For me it was Uldum in Cata and YES I did think it was the best one in Cata.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Considering how fast Legion is falling and how we've reached the point where whenever we see a blue post its an admittance that they have not listened to any feedback? It can safely be said that a lot of whats going on right now is the devs fault. <br />
<br />
Also, Uldum was a well paced zone, in that it was well done. However, from a writing standpoint it was unquestionably hot garbage. Over 2/3 of the zone was just indiana jones references. And not even subtle ones. It was bad, lazy, writing.</div></div><hr />
