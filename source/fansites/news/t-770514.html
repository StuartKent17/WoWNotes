As an update to this, the next beta build will include a slider bar (labeled &quot;Custom Latency Tolerance&quot;) that lets you tune how sensitive the ability queue is (including sliding it all the way to zero if you choose). This value allows you to control (in milliseconds) how long before the GCD finishes the client will let you queue your next ability.<br />
<br />
The optimal setting will probably be right around what your ping time is. So, if your ping is 100 for example, you'd probably want to set it at 100 or slightly higher. <br />
<br />
Does that mean that the plans to add in the ability to replace a previous command is out? or is that still a possibility?<br />
That's still in too. It's just that while overriding is helpful it can still fail if your override gets to the server a little too late and your previously queued ability goes off anyways. <br />
<br />
why cant you just make the client dynamically change this setting based on the ping rather than make the player choose it and probably get it wrong? <br />
We plan to do this as the default value (when you aren't overriding it) in a future patch. There are some complexities that prevent us from being able to do it right now. <br />
<br />
How are you going to address people using the TCPAckFrequency registry hack to &quot;lower&quot; their ping? Are you going to disable it in-game, similar to how you handled the nagle algorithm?<br />
The server now enforces the actual global cooldown value, whereas in the past it allowed a .4 sec slush. So, instead of having a slush factor that let somebody cast a bit early, it now catches the request, waits until the cooldown has actually completed, then casts the spell for you (the queue'd ability) at the soonest possible time. <br />

Guild Members Capped in 4.0.1 - Update<br />
We previously announced in the Cataclysm Beta forums that we'd be enforcing a 600 guild member cap with patch 4.0.1. We've reevaluated what we believe the realms are capable of supporting and instead will be enforcing a guild member hard cap of 1,000 members. This means that guilds with more than 1,000 members will no longer be able to invite new members until they drop below the cap. For example, if a guild has 1,500 members they'll be able to continue as-is, playing and earning guild achievements for as long as they choose, through Cataclysm and beyond, but they will not be able to add new members until they fall below the 1,000 member cap. If a guild has fewer than 1,000 members, they won't be able to add members above that number.<br />
<br />
This new guild cap is being enforced for several reasons, but they all factor into a need to control guild sizes in light of the new guild systems, including guild leveling and achievements. Previously, adding players to a guild was as simple as adding people to a chat channel. While approximately 500 members were visible in the UI, there was no real need to limit guild size. That is no longer the case. Guild leveling in Cataclysm features unified progression powered by a series of complex systems that track the contributions of all guild members. The larger the guild, the bigger the impact on these systems. We found it necessary to determine a maximum guild size to ensure continued performance now and into the future.<br />
<br />
We want to reassure the few guilds that this does impact that they have ample time to plan and rearrange their guilds as they see fit. While this hard cap will go into effect with 4.0.1, guilds should feel safe rearranging members as necessary up to the release of Cataclysm on December 7 when the guild leveling system goes into effect. There will be no impact on guild leveling progression before then. If a guild were to disband after Cataclysm, or a group of people were to leave and start a new guild, they would lose the time and experience they previously contributed and potentially extend the amount of time it would take to regain the new guild perks.<br />
<br />
While some players have used options including mods and custom chat channels to support large player and guild alliances that number multiple thousands, groups of that size aren't ideally suited to our design philosophy. As always, we're continually looking into adding new features to help facilitate guild management, scheduling, and player communication. <br />

310% Speed mount skill<br />
You'll have to pay for the skill, but your mount speed will increase with your riding skill level. This way, you can pretty much roll through all of your favorite mounts without feeling as if you are neglecting any of them. <br />
<br />
[...] I apologize for the added confusion. If you have 310% now, the boost is free. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026400553/question-about-310-mounts-in-cata/))<br />
<br />
[...] We want people to be able to pick and choose the mount (or mounts) they enjoy using without feeling like they're being penalized. There are a lot of different mounts to choose from and for some people, that mount they got awhile back that was so awesome, lost its luster after that next fast mount came out.

<br />
Reforging - Primary vs. Secondary Stats<br />
The primary stats (strength, agility, intellect or stamina for tanks) are nearly always going to be more powerful than the secondary stats. That's the primary reason why you can't refoge them. With the exception of gems and enchants, you don't have a ton of flexibility in stacking your primary stats on gear -- they come at pretty set ratios to item level. You can choose to just gem all primary stats, or you can get fancy with the orange, purple and green gems since socket bonuses are more powerful in Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
It's a bigger problem if either haste, crit or mastery are of wildly different value for a given spec. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026480301/very-concerned-about-feral-cat/))<br />

Justice Point Drop Quantities (See the original post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2004-Cataclysm-Justice-Point-Drop-Quantities))<br />
Just a quick note that the points listed here aren't final, we're still trying to balance the numbers. Specifically for Cataclysm drops. It's possible they may still change. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026399005/cataclysm-justice-point-drop-quantities/))<br />

Tanking<br />
Dazed<br />
You should not be getting dazed on live if you are the defense &quot;cap&quot; and you shouldn't be getting dazed on the PTR if you have the anti-crit talents. If you meet those requirements, then it's a bug. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026399992/daze-needs-to-die-in-a-fire/))<br />
<br />
Pulling aggro from tanks<br />
Unless you're doing something unusual, healer threat is generally pretty low, and tends to go lower if there are many targets. The biggest danger tends to be when adds spawn and a heal lands before you have done any threat against the new arrivals. If you are targeting Thunder Clap (I'm going to use Thunder Clap as my example, but this discussion is not limited to warriors) so that everything is in range and healers are still pulling, then something unusual is probably happening. Maybe you're taking so much damage that the healers are just spamming heals on you, which might suggest you need to somehow manage some of the adds that doesn't involve all of them beating on you so much.<br />
<br />
You're probably at more risk overall of having dps pull off of you. Here are the scenarios again about how that could work:<br />
<br />
One target -- if a dps pulls off of you, they are either blowing cooldowns before you have a chance to respond, or your threat generation is much too low for some reason.<br />
<br />
Many targets -- in this case, the dps are probably AE'ing. Usually they will kill things pretty quickly, but they might get a few adds on them. These situations are always a little chaotic, but also don't last very long. We don't do many huge AE packs of mobs that hit brutally hard.<br />
<br />
A few targets -- in this case, you might be CC'ing one or two, tanking a few others, but burning down the targets one at a time. If the dps are on the right target and pulling off of you, then we're back to situation one. If they are on the wrong target, then they are playing badly and should be corrected and / or mocked, depending on how you roll.<br />
<br />
On the one target scenario, you may not need to Thunder Clap on cooldown. The cooldown is 6 sec and the debuff duration is 30, and the threat is not so massive that you should just always Thunder Clap any target. On the few targets scenario, it's at your discretion. Thunder Clap may help keep aggro on the targets not being dps'ed but you might also break CC. On many targets, you should Thunder Clap your heart out. You can tab target your other abilities around, and many tanks do, but you can't realistically tab target them all, so it's not going to make a massive difference. In the few case, you are going to want to spend most of your single-target abilities on the dps target, but perhaps start shifting over to the next target so that you have a headstart when that becomes the target.<br />
<br />
That was a long explanation, and it's possible your question was just a thinly veiled jab at how your single target and AE rotations aren't that different, but I think the prioritization of how you use them is. <br />
<br />
He was saying that our AoE threat is mostly fine right now because of tab target and cleave, but that's for smaller groups. He's saying we struggle holding larger groups because we don't have other options. <br />
And I'm saying you can hold them well enough. If the mage catches a couple of whelps, it's probably not going to kill him before the whelps die. If we did AE packs of giants or devilsaurs or Marrowgars, then it would be critical for a tank to be able to hold a very large number of targets. But we don't. &quot;Tanking&quot; those large packs is really more about trying to decrease the damage done to others. You aren't going to be able to control it that well. Generally if you find you can't control N number of targets, then it's a reasonable bet that we don't expect you to control that many. You're supposed to CC some or just burn them down, depending on the scenario. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026377623/thunderclap-is-too-weak/))<br />

Word of Glory as Protection<br />
This is the kind of thing we're still messing around with. We want Protection to be able to use Word of Glory occasionally in emergencies or to help the healers out, but we are aware that if it's too potent, paladins will just tank by healing themselves (either because of threat generation or mana savings).<br />
<br />
We also need to make sure that the AP coefficient for the heal isn't affected by Vengeance. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026399935/word-of-glory-tps-can-t-be-intended-can-it/))<br />

If only they'd made the Red Proto-Drake a 310% mount like everyone says it should be, then I would have my flying speed already but, no, because it's not and I can't manage to grab a 310% mount before Cataclysm, I'm just going to have to pay extra money whereas everyone else doesn't. <br />

If it's not too much (Around 1-2k.) then I'll be less annoyed, but if it's going to cost me around the same price that it did to get me my epic flying then I'm going to be really angry.

If only they'd made the Red Proto-Drake a 310% mount like everyone says it should be, then I would have my flying speed already but, no, because it's not and I can't manage to grab a 310% mount before Cataclysm, I'm just going to have to pay extra money whereas everyone else doesn't. <br />
<br />
If it's not too much (Around 1-2k.) then I'll be less annoyed, but if it's going to cost me around the same price that it did to get me my epic flying then I'm going to be really angry. It just doesn't seem fair to me at all that if you've already got one of these mounts then you get the damn thing absolutely free.<br />
<br />
So... you're mad that you haven't taken the time to do all these really annoying achievements in Ulduar or ICC like we all have, and are being given the easier option of just buying 310% instead of trying to form a capable enough ten man to raid 1-2 weeks to get the freebie one? Wat? If I had the choice of just buying it or doing Iron Dwarf Medium Rare or Full House, I would have just bought it.<br />

Well that's generally how it works, yes. If you don't earn something like the 310% flying, then you don't get 310% flying, just like how if you don't kill stuff for gear you don't get the gear to raid. The only difference between those is that gear is required to raid, whereas the 310% flying mount isn't required to fly as you can do fine with the 280% or whatever the speed is (totally forgot already). It's totally fair that people get a return on their efforts to get a 310% mount and people who didn't earn one have to pay.</div></div><hr />

Getting 310% mount only needs one year doing the world events - everybody can do that. You don't need a raid, you can do it all by yourself. If you are too lazy to do it, no 310% mount for you.</div></div><hr />

Seams like blizzard cares little about realism when designing mounts!<br />
<br />
Actually, they care a lot, but one of the problems with game animation is that you MUST have a pre-action to every action.<br />
<br />
Think of it this way; if you throw your arm in the air, it's basically just forward and up to you, right?<br />
But, if you do that for a game character, their shoulder will go haywire and it'll look butchered. So for the game character, they need to move the arm back FIRST, then forward and up.<br />
<br />
It's weird, but ask any animation student. :) I spent 2 yrs doing that in college. Believe me, that camel walk is really good, and if you look close, the two legs on each side ARE in motion at the same time, the pre-action just sets them slightly apart. ^-^</div></div><hr />

I totally agree here.<br />
<br />
Those are the ram animations + some epic cud chewing action. (The cud chewing had me super excited, and then utter disappointment when I saw the run/walk!)<br />
<br />
Camels have such a unique gait IRL that any animation enthusist would jump at the chance to reproduce it. Camels show up all over cartoons for this reason. They're freaking awesome.<br />
<br />
I hope that they let one of their poor overworked animators really have at it and give us a nice &quot;two legs on one side, two legs on the other&quot; run like it's supposed to have, and the slow methodical march and not that &quot;pick up the heels prancing&quot; that the rams/talbuks share.</div></div><hr />

Yeah... what the hell, how dare they base the camel animations on how real world camels act. I mean, camels are awesome but making the camel run like camels actually run, FAIL! Chew cud like they chew cud FAIL. Blizzard, you are monsters for making a goofy looking animal goofy, you should have given it the generic horse animation frame despite camels not running entirely like horses.<br />
<br />
/sarcasm<br />
<br />
Maybe you didn't really like the idea of a camel mount, the model was cartoony and goofy the animations reflect that, I'm not entirely sure what you expected the camel to act like, but it clearly wasn't a camel. Basically what it comes down too is you think that Camels are fail and you are taking it out on Blizzards animation team... well played troll well played.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Indeed, I know it is, and this comment goes for everyone else that took time to reply to my comment.<br />
<br />
I know it may seem a little strange, but frankly I don't have time to do the achievements and whatnot for the 310% mounts. The easiest one for me to get would be the Violet Proto-Drake, but my main character has only been my main for around three months, so I've only got two of the titles so far. I still have a while to go. Plus I haven't been playing for as long as many other players will have.<br />
<br />
I know that I won't have to buy this flying skill, but I will eventually want to, plus what will happen to the achievement mounts we currently have that give 310% riding skill? My biggest concern is really how much this extra flying will cost.<br />
<br />
<br />
Everyone else has a 310%? So why should Blizzard change something when it's fine for 11999999 players out of 12000000?<br />
<br />
I knew someone was going to make a comment like that about it. I was exaggerating, of course.<br />
<br />
<br />
Getting 310% mount only needs one year doing the world events - everybody can do that. You don't need a raid, you can do it all by yourself. If you are too lazy to do it, no 310% mount for you.<br />
<br />
I haven't even had this character a year yet, so, no, I'm not being too lazy. Consider that first before you write anything about me being 'lazy'.</div></div><hr />

Also, am I the only one who will be turning that latency bar all the way down? I like the GCD system as it is, thank you, blizzard.<br />
<br />
Watch the video &quot;How To Do Top DPS in WoW&quot; on YouTube. Basically Blizzard is nerfing what is being described in that video.<br />
<br />
In short, setting it to 0 will screw you royally. The ideal setting is exactly as they describe (about your latency). Currently live assumes around 400ms for everyone and starts allowing actions 400ms before GCD. Obviously this much more beneficial for people under 400ms, and this is how low-ping bastards do a ton more DPS with the same gear than everyone else.<br />
<br />
There is also an undetectable GCD exploit out there that allows you to reduce your GCD to 1s or 0s. It's been out there for years, especially in Arena and in high-stakes raiding. So Blizzard has been tuning content for people using a 0ms GCD. Now you know why H-LK 25 had to be so hard.</div></div><hr />

Wow..no..I mean...c'mon. 310% mounts are either raid or pvp related, meaning ppl had to put at least SOME form of effort and skill into it - and if you didn't raid, there was (and is) still that holiday proto, which takes amost zero skill just a bit of dedication. And if your character is under a year old - it still only takes 4 hours to do all Ulduar 10 achieves. There ireally is no excuse and time is no excuse.

2k?<br />
Last time i checked it was 5k, and that's still dirt cheap comparing it to the time, money (because flasks, foodbuffs and repairs are not free the last time i checked) and effort we had to put into it.<br />
<br />
They should put a real price tag onto it for the people that really want that.<br />
The difference is not so great so it's a pure e-peen thing, and that should be gotten thru raiding achievements, doing hihg end pvp, putting in a lot of dedication (that purple thing) or just be absurdly expensive.</div></div><hr />

WAAAAAHH WAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!&quot; Or perhaps one of those cats that had major beef w/ the fact that Druids never had to pay for base flight and we got it 2 levels before everyone else did (back before they changed flight lvl to 68).<br />
<br />
You think that the 310% flight speed is absolutely free to those that will have it come Cata?? LMAO!!!! What rock do you live under? I got my 310% flight by doing Ulduar 10 runs OVER and OVER...and then think of all the cats that did the ICC HEROIC and reg achievements to get their drakes (which i'm in the process of completing this weekend)...Take all that TIME, and ALL of the money people spent on food/flasks/reagents and REPAIRS. That certainly DOES NOT add up to being free in ANY way.<br />
<br />
If you're too lazy to farm some gold or do some raiding before Cata comes out then you DO NOT DESERVE THE SPEED INCREASE. If ppl like you had it their way, all epic loot would be given away for free just because it has to be &quot;fair for everyone&quot; and not be a REWARD for playing the game.<br />

<br />
In short, setting it to 0 will screw you royally. The ideal setting is exactly as they describe (about your latency). Currently live assumes around 400ms for everyone and starts allowing actions 400ms before GCD. Obviously this much more beneficial for people under 400ms, and this is how low-ping bastards do a ton more DPS with the same gear than everyone else.<br />
<br />
There is also an undetectable GCD exploit out there that allows you to reduce your GCD to 1s or 0s. It's been out there for years, especially in Arena and in high-stakes raiding. So Blizzard has been tuning content for people using a 0ms GCD. Now you know why H-LK 25 had to be so hard.<br />
<br />
<br />
I like how you know so little that you call it an &quot;exploit&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
From everything they say, they just don't want tanks to be the deciding factor in an encounter, they want heals and massive DPS survivability to be the most important thing. In that case, I bet we'll see a lot more DPS tanks.</div></div><hr />

I'm glad to learn that Blizzard has upped the guild membership limit to 1,000. While there are no guilds on my server (US-Malfurion) that come anywhere close to that limit, I have heard of a few servers that do have guilds over -- the originally planned hardcap -- 600 characters. Sounds like a pretty good compromise to me.<br />
<br />
What leaves me wondering is the adjustable latence tolerance thingie, but that's what I have my oldest brother for. :P<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
After reading about these 1000 person guilds it just scares me that the days of having guilds of 10 friends is going to fall away to server sized guild lvling machines<br />
I understand where you're coming from, but let's try looking at it from a different perspective. To the best of my knowledge, guilds that are 500+ constitute only a small fraction out of the total. How will the introduction of guild leveling be so drastic as to change that? While inevitably some may join a larger guild to get the perks sooner, many more will just stick with being where they are because the perks aren't worth giving up being with friends and/or tolerating jerks.<br />
<br />
<br />
I know it may seem a little strange, but frankly I don't have time to do the achievements and whatnot for the 310% mounts. The easiest one for me to get would be the Violet Proto-Drake, but my main character has only been my main for around three months, so I've only got two of the titles so far. I still have a while to go. Plus I haven't been playing for as long as many other players will have.<br />
<br />
I know that I won't have to buy this flying skill, but I will eventually want to, plus what will happen to the achievement mounts we currently have that give 310% riding skill? My biggest concern is really how much this extra flying will cost.<br />
Having a 310% mount was originally only to be had in raiding back in TBC. With WotLK, it became easier to obtain a 310% mount by doing certain raid achievements instead of only hoping for an incredibly rare drop. In addition to that, Blizzard was nice enough to give a way to obtain a 310% mount outside of raiding (but would justifiably take longer to complete).<br />
<br />
So when I hear what seems to me to be whining, yes, I shake my head. I have the holiday mount and I know how tedious it was to get. Anyone remember how people were having a problem with the Be Mine! (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/1701/be-mine/) from 2009's Love is in the Air event? Even with the retroactive change by Blizzard, I still didn't get the title (neither did Aliok) and so instead of getting the proto-drake by December, I had to wait until the next valentine event. Did I gripe to Aliok and mentally smack Blizzard with an Acme mallet? I sure did. Did I forget that I was lucky in that I knew that I would eventually get a 310% mount? No, and I finally got it in February.<br />
<br />
Right now, Blizzard is planning on going further with allowing a player to buy 310% speed for 5k gold. In Cataclysm (not that it isn't already in WotLK), that is chump change. If for some reason you can't even reach that threshold, then you don't deserve to get 310% speed. It's not like 280% is bad, anyway.</div></div><hr />

I've gotten a few 310% mounts on one of my toons, and none on the rest. I'll probably never shell out the 5k gold for 310% on the latter, because to be perfectly honest that ~7-8% boost in speed does not significantly impact my ability to enjoy the game.<br />
<br />
Also<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, they care a lot, but one of the problems with game animation is that you MUST have a pre-action to every action.<br />
<br />
Think of it this way; if you throw your arm in the air, it's basically just forward and up to you, right?<br />
But, if you do that for a game character, their shoulder will go haywire and it'll look butchered. So for the game character, they need to move the arm back FIRST, then forward and up.<br />
<br />
It's weird, but ask any animation student. :) I spent 2 yrs doing that in college. Believe me, that camel walk is really good, and if you look close, the two legs on each side ARE in motion at the same time, the pre-action just sets them slightly apart. ^-^<br />
<br />
If you have to move an arm back before you can throw it up in the air, it's because you have not skinned your shoulders properly and thus cannot model natural motion. The camel walk is very good. Unless I am seriously misinterpreting your post, I feel I can safely assert that this &quot;pre-action&quot; explanation is total BS.</div></div><hr />

Nice overgeneralization that further reinforces why people disagreed with you. Your playstyle must involve a supercasual style for you to only have 7k gold. So I will say I am one of those &quot;idiots&quot; who thinks that the large price for premium flying is a justified. It literally takes 3 hours and a decent group of alts to complete ALL of the ulduar 10 achievments. If you can't devote that much time to saving 5k gold..then I don't think there is anything you would be happy with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The most gold I've ever earned at one point is around 9k. I'm so sorry that I'm not like the rest of the players of the game who all seem to be able to reach the gold cap with ease. Sorry for having a 'supercasual' playstyle and not being able to or wanting to play the game 6-12 hours a day or more.</div></div><hr />

You say nobody is understanding your point, but I disagree. Based on all your posts it seems that you do not feel it is fair that people who have not put in the effort required to obtain a 310% speed mount should be able to acquire, for free, the same benefit that those who have done so enjoy now.<br />
<br />
It is a simple truth, in game or otherwise, that those who put in more effort receive rewards faster. Or are able to attain things that those who either cannot or will not devote the same amount of effort are unable to attain. Remember that up to this point, because you say that you do not have the time required to raid, you would not have had any option to get a 310% mount besides the holiday meta-achievement. Even then, before Cataclysm, you would have been limited to only that one mount. And yet when Blizzard provides a means by which you can acquire the faster speed, in fact on ANY flying mount you own instead of being limited, by &quot;only&quot; paying for it, you complain. And before this comes up, the fact that WoW is a game does not mean that things should simply be given to you without requiring any effort on your part.<br />
<br />
Blizzard makes it easier, especially for people with limited playtime, and yet you complain. I am sorry if people do not agree with you. But telling those that do not agree with you that they did not understand your point just makes you look like a self-entitled whiner.<br />
<br />

<br />
You're right, now I think about it, all of the current 310% mounts in game are either achievement mounts based on raids or mounts that have very low drop rates. (Like the Onyxian Drake.) People have to work hard for those mounts, or get extremely lucky. So by making the mount speed 'buyable' it's actually making things easier to us. I should've seen that before really, as Blizzard are good at just making things easier. Thanks for clearing that up, and sorry.</div></div><hr />

Only having 7K gold is &quot;supercasual&quot;?

Although this guy is one of those people who give WoW players their horrible stereotype I roughly agree with hard stuff should be earned. In fact even with my poor characters I would say 5k gold is far too cheap for 310% because with cataclysm casual gold will go up so 5K won't take too long for people to earn. I mean it is the same price as 280% from 2 expansions ago! (by cata) if 5K was feasible in BC then 5K won't be hard in Endgame cata if you put some effort in.<br />

Ha someone is exaggerateing. People like you need to find something else to do with your time other than play mindless dailies or fail at raids on a game you play too much and make up stuff. Your fairy tale of job, gf, and social life might put me to sleep. I'm guessing the job must be flipping burgers, gf is a tub who plays wow with you 8 hours a day and the &quot;healthy social life&quot; is your guild and maybe 3 friends who you go over to their basement and either play more wow, Starcraft, rockband or Smash bros. Seriously, 35K and you say you make couple hundred gold a week, you are boring/useless because you get that gold for nothing then criticize people who don't bother with that crap. Elitest boring loser.<br />
<br />
Although I admit there are probably people worse than you out there it's people like you and their attitudes that give gamers stereotypes like this: <br />
http://www.dorkly.com/video/4053/ridiculous-portrayal-of-gamers-on-law-amp-order-svu<br />
It's ridiculous but when you babble on about ridiculous things like me &quot;spending money stupidly&quot; (I can spend it how I want, at least i'm doing stuff with it) while you build up money doing repetitive nothingness with your likely 5+ alts with all the professions you come off to other people kinda like this.
