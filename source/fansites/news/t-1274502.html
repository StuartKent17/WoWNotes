Look for more information on the ToT RPPM trinkets soon (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/311562675836551168)!<br />
Lead Systems Designer Greg Street (Ghostcrawler) wanted to give notice of several class hotfixes that went live last night along with the reasoning behind those changes.<br />
<br />
Hotfixes:<br />
<br />
<br />
Mage: Nether Tempest (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/114923), Living Bomb (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/44461), Frost Bomb (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/113092) damage +40%. <br />
<br />
<br />
We’re happy with the relative power of Arcane, Fire and Frost mages in PvE to each other, but all three specs are below where we want them. We were hoping that once groups got past the first few 5.2 raid encounters that benefit a lot from multi-dotting that we’d see mage DPS climb, but it’s not there yet. We don’t want to change rotations or force players to change specs, so we wanted a relatively passive change. <br />
<br />
We decided to buff the bombs because it affects all three specs relatively similarly and is as close to a passive form of damage as mages have. Had we buffed the cast-time nukes, the risk is that mages would lose even more DPS on high movement or high multi-dot fights, which wasn’t our intent. If these buffs aren’t sufficient, we will happily make more, but we’d rather make a few buffs a few times in a row rather than over buff then have to nerf it back down.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warlock: Corruption (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/131740) damage -25%.<br />
Warlock: Doom damage -25%.<br />
Priest: Shadow Word: Pain (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/589) damage -25%. <br />
<br />
<br />
We want the dot specs to do well in multi-dot scenarios, but Affliction, Demonology and Shadow were doing too well on multi-dot fights and are still quite competitive on non-multi-dot fights. Balance druids, so far, are where we want them to be.<br />
<br />
<br />
Death Knight: Howling Blast (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/49184) secondary target damage to 50% of primary target (down from 65%) Death Knight: Rune Strike (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/56815) damage +25%.<br />
Warrior: Shield Slam (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/23922) damage +25%.<br />
Warrior: Deep Wounds (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/115768) damage for Protection only, +50%. <br />
<br />
<br />
We’re keeping a close eye on death knights. Frost and Unholy are both performing really well, but Frost was higher than we wanted during cleave-type scenarios. They will still be quite good at cleaving even with this change.<br />
<br />
Tank DPS is a difficult metric to measure because some tanks care a lot about their DPS, and work to maximize it, while others are content to fill the more traditional tank role of worrying about survivability and boss control, and pay less attention to their DPS. Therefore, it’s challenging to analyze logs and determine whether you’re seeing the full potential of tank DPS or not. For now, we think warrior and DK tank DPS was a little low, so we took steps to adjust it.<br />
<br />
Remember, it’s not a goal that every spec do exactly equally well in every possible encounter, and in fact we think that would be boring. We just don’t want things to get so extreme that certain specs feel like they aren’t meaningfully contributing to the group’s efforts. All of this means that raid performance is a somewhat subjective call and we’d like to ask that you keep that in mind as you offer your feedback.<br />
<br />

Throne of Thunder LFR Opens Today<br />
The first three bosses of Throne of Thunder become available on Raid Finder difficulty today! You can find their encounter journal and loot tables on the pages linked below, and boss guides over at Icy Veins (http://www.icy-veins.com/throne-of-thunder-raid-wow). <br />
<br />
It is worth noting that the bridge trash isn't as bad as it is in normal difficulty and the difficulty is significantly lower than it was on the PTR during earlier testing. <br />
<br />

<br />
It isn't a problem. It says &quot;are competitive&quot; as in after the dot nerf.<br />
<br />
Meaning they lowered the &quot;too high&quot; multi-dots without breaking single target so all is fine for us =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It very often shows 10 man first. Enough people need to log out for armory updates and then WoWProgress has to update. They did it in 25. <br />
<br />
<br />
Need a &quot;how do do bridge trash&quot; video or uber nerf.. That shit is stoooooooooooooooooopid to do with lfr.<br />

GC talked about changing how the RPPM trinkets were proccing. Either I was getting absurdly lucky or it was proccing correctly today while I raided.</div></div><hr />

They're shooting from the hip with these changes. Last week spriests +25% on SW:P, this week its reverted. Mages rebuffed, when they were just fine. +40% damage on frost bomb? That will completely break PvP.<br />

<br />
The changes are crap. The frost bomb will break pvp. <br />
The shadow was anyway not competetive cause you have almost no instans left and you can't cast without of getting your dispersion locked(and you killed) immidiately by any good team(it's the old shadow problem. No def, slow damage build up...and no way to seriously escape. That makes you first target cause you are easy to knock out and you can't cast(e.g. hurt the enemy) while under fire and you die fast).<br />
<br />
Last but not least I don't see the problem. Why the hell can't multi dot/aoe classes be ahead at multi-target fight...I mean blizz doesn't seem to have a problem with single target classes being way ahead(almost 15% ahead of shadow during 5.9/5.1) at single target fights either.</div></div><hr />

You are absolutely right. But hasn't PvP always been the one taking the real hits for some unjustified pve dps tuning.<br />
Do mages really need to be the number 1 like they have _mostly_ been since end of armorpene. Why not let them taste what it feels like to not faceroll nr1 spot on meters for once</div></div><hr />

<br />
No offence to mage players though.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magic Sausage</div><div class="date">2013-03-13, 03:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">These nerfs and buffs seem to me like an act of desperation. A last effort to try and balance classes before heroic raiding starts. <br />
<br />
The buff to ALL bombs isn't going to fix the current issues mages have and will only hurt pvp even further.<br />
The corruption nerf also directly nerfs MG and buries Aff pvp even further.<br />
The Doom nerf is complete overkill. Multi-dotting as demo was already clunky as fuck to do and this is directly hurts demo's single target, which wasn't over the top at all.<br />
The SW:P nerf is completely random and beyond me.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if I want to continue with this expansion. Not because of these changes specifically (I main a holy paladin and balance druid), but because of the blatant lack of class and spec direction. To me it seems that the devs are lost and have no clue how to fix the numerous mechanical issues plaguing certain classes and specs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Frost Bomb now deals 60% of its damage when used against other players, down from 80%.<br />
http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8197590653?page=32#635 <br />
<br />
I'm still not convinced that the mage bomb buffs are enough to push them to be better in the meters overall though.</div></div><hr />

funny, he said the same thing to eleshamans, except he didnt mention what kind of fights are great for ele. Its probably his new scapegoat argument to hide their complete lack of competence to balance classes properly</div></div><hr />
