<br />
Ring in the New Year with a Grand Fireworks Display!<br />
Head to your favorite capital city to watch fireworks light the skies beginning at 6:00 p.m. realm time tonight (December 31) and every hour on the hour. It’s a celebration you won’t want to miss, so get on your /dancing shoes and don your finest party transmog as we ring in a new year.<br />
<br />
If you’re on a PvP realm, we’d advise extra caution around Booty Bay. The guards don’t seem to be enforcing the town rules and won’t be until the new day dawns.<br />
<br />
<br />
Armory Stats - Winter Veil Gifts<br />
As we wait for the new year to arrive, we are taking a look back to see how many current players have the old Winter Veil gifts. For these stats, we defined current player as any player that had a Level 110 character that has logged in during the past two months. <br />
<br />
Keep in mind that the number for this year isn't quite accurate yet, as you can still open gifts for a while. While we were gathering data, we noticed that only 83,990 players in our database have all 10 years of gifts! <br />

This Month in WoW - January 2017<br />
It’s almost time to ring in the new year! In this edition of This Month in WoW, we share what’s coming for the month of January, take a brief look back on 2016, and ask you to share your Word of Warcraft plans for the New Year.<br />
<br />
Time is Running Out! - Adopt Mischief and Support Make-A-Wish® <br />
Time is running out to adopt this World of Warcraft® in-game pet from in in-game shop and the Battle.net Shop (http://blizz.ly/mischiefpet).

Learn more on our post here (https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/20381198/adopt-mischief-today-and-support-make-a-wish).<br />
<br />
Holidays <br />
<br />
New Year’s Fireworks! [December 31- January 1]<br />
Ring in the new year in Azeroth by heading to your favorite capital city to watch the fireworks displays which will begin at 6 pm PST and reoccur every hour on the hour. If you’re up for a little extra PvP, you may want to head toward Booty Bay where the guards have eschewed the town rules for the night.<br />
<br />
Lunar Festival [ January 21- February 4]<br />
Every year the druids of Moonglade hold a celebration of their city’s great triumph over an ancient evil. During the Lunar Festival, citizens of Azeroth have the opportunity to honor their elders by celebrating their sage wisdom, sharing in magnificent feasts, and of course… shooting firewoks!<br />
<br />
2016 in Brief<br />
2016 has been a great and terrible year for the citizens of Azeroth. The forces of the Horde and Alliance both managed to defend Draenor from the machinations of Gul’dan and his Legion allies within Hellfire Citadel, but in turn, the Burning Legion has set its sights once more on Azeroth. New heroes have arisen with the addition of the Demon Hunters who have joined in the fight to save Azeroth from the onslaught in the World of Warcraft:Legion (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/legion/) expansion. The next chapters have yet to be told, but we know the heroes of Azeroth will rise to the challenge as each present themselves.<br />
<br />
Fan Art<br />
Artists from around the world have continued to share their amazing pieces of work with us and we wanted to take a moment to show off some of the amazing pieces they’ve created throughout the year.<br />
<br />

<br />
We look forward to seeing what the talented World of Warcraft community will create next!<br />
<br />
What’s Your 2017 WoW Resolution?<br />
It’s that time again, in which we all take a look at our lives in Azeroth and make a resolution or two on what we plan to do in the year ahead. Whether it’s to help new players every third Friday, get that one Achievement you just haven’t gotten yet, or to take your Mythic Keystone difficulty even further, we want to know.<br />
<br />
What’s your 2017 WoW Resolution? Share it with us in the comments below.<br />

Things like the much awaited Nighthold Raid opening on the 17th. These usual events they have in the Blue Posts just don't feel interesting, add something to spice it up!</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I'm a bit confused about is why the 2016 percentage is so low. I get that people still have time, but you'd think at least 50% of active players would pick them up, or at least a percentage greater than any other year.</div></div><hr />

The char I am on right now earned the 2007 winter veil AV in 2012, the 2008 AV in 2016 and the 2009 AV in 2011.<br />
Okay, this one is not 110 yet but a couple of my others chars are.<br />
<br />
I started playing early 2009 and still have all AVs on at least one random char, how is it even possible that such a low number has all ten gifts?<br />
<br />
Okay, just checked and my main and two other level 110 chars have all ten gifts.</div></div><hr />

So what you can do in this case Blizzard in order to bring back the old players? :)<br />
<br />
Bring back the old talent tree (dotted): We would like to customize our characters.<br />
PvP set: Why did you delete? The old system was the great idea in WoD. If you get something damage from another player --&gt; ilvl of your PvP set will be increase.<br />
Pve set: I'm missing the good old system solution. You and your friends go to Raid for getting the epic/legendary items and not farming these. <br />
Arena groups: personal AND team rating and disable the farming mode especially in PvP (artifact weapon, pvp reputation... omg).<br />
Farming --&gt; Profession!<br />
<br />
Thank you! :)<br />
<br />
Happy new year to you!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nekobaka</div><div class="date">2017-01-01, 10:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Considering 2016 is higher than the years of MoP is it really &quot;a bit low&quot;?<br />

I think this raises more questions of why the years of MoP rewards are the lowest.</div></div><hr />

Bring back the old talent tree (dotted): We would like to customize our characters.<br />

<br />
Case in point ^. <br />
<br />
As an old player, they'd drive me away if they went back to the cookie-cutter talent trees we used to have that you'd change even LESS often than the current ones. Nostalgia is the enemy of progress indeed.</div></div><hr />
