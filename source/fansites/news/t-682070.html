<meta name="description" content="Jeff Kaplan interview on GameInformer 
GameInformer.com sat down with Jeff Kaplan (Tigole) to talk about World of Warcraft's past and future.

GameInformer.com (http://gameinformer.com/games/world_of_warcraft_cataclysm/b/pc/archive/2009/12/02/blizzard-s-jeff-kaplan-on-warcraft-s-past-and-future.aspx) sat down with Jeff Kaplan (Tigole) to talk about World of Warcraft's past and future. It's just like any other World of Warcraft interview without anything really new (it's still worth reading!) but there is a very interesting answer here. Tigole confirms that there will be a cinematic just like the Wrath Gate one in Patch 3.3, most likely featuring the Lich King. <br />
<br />
It's not on PTRs yet and a minor patch released a few months after 3.3 to introduce Season 8 and the Cinematic is very likely. They could always push the season 8 models and the cinematic in the final version of Patch 3.3 but I don't think they would do that without testing at least the models of Season 8 armor. (And they're definitely not here for the moment)<br />
GameInformer: I would agree that the game has gotten much better at showing rather than telling, but Wrath of the Lich King also saw the introduction of cutscenes to the game. It’s obviously much easier to tell the story in that, but you’re also taking the player out of the game. Do you think that those will keep showing up future expansions as well? Is it something you’ll use sparingly?<br />
<br />
Jeff Kaplan: Cutscenes will always be something that we use sparingly, yes. We never want to interrupt gameplay too frequently or for too long of a period of time. The Wrathgate cutscene was a big experiment for us. It was our first foray into in-game cutscenes in World of Warcraft. I don’t think we’ve fully refined how we want cutscenes to work with future World of Warcraft content.<br />
<br />
We debate like crazy. We debate the length, we debate the frequency, and we have a lot of theories, but Blizzard is a really iterative development house. I think what’s going to have to happen is that you’ll see more cutscenes come into the game for us to really refine our strategy with them. We definitely have an eye toward more cutscenes, but at the same time, we don’t want to become just a cutscene game.<br />
<br />
Even before Cataclysm, in patch 3.3, there’s going to be a really exciting cutscene moment that’s going to be our next experiment with that.<br />

Elemental &quot;sacrifice&quot; to debuff the raid<br />
We want classes to have to take a hit for buffing the raid, but we don't want it to be a gigantic one. Again, on the one hand players are eager for these buffs because it &quot;secures them a slot!&quot; but on the other hand, they want someone else to do the buff so they don't have to.<br />
<br />
The problem is some of our implementations (and to be fair, more of the newer versions of these buffs) come with less opportunistic cost, or the talent specs make it easier to include the buff, or it happens automatically instead of requiring player action. We realize these are rough edges that still need to be polished down.<br />
<br />
We made some pretty massive strides in Lich King to overhaul the way buffs and debuffs work. It's in a lot better place than it was, but we still have a lot of work to do. <br />
<br />
[...] I said that Ele shaman don't want to have to drop ToW because of the personal dps loss, but they also want to have ToW because it's an attractive raid buff. That is what I meant. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/21585909051-elemental-so-whats-going-on.html))<br />
<br />
Fire Totems changes in 3.3<br />
We like the fire totem changes. It's a new change and I'm sure it will require some iteration before it feels exactly right, but we like the mechanic overall. It's not critical that Searing Totem be an uber form of dps in the same way that Sentry Totem's very existence might offend you. We did a big update of totems for Lich King. They're not perfect yet, but when you remember what they used to be like, they're in a much better place now.<br />
<br />
We see Elementals &quot;turretiness&quot; as a slightly different issue, and one we want to fix. No spec should be so terrified of moving, even one dependent on stationary points on the map where their totems are.<br />
<br />
Also be very careful that you aren't just describing totems in general as a clunky mechanic. I see that kind of thing a lot, but totems are virtually synonymous with shaman in our minds. If you really, really hate totems, you might not be playing the class that best suits your play style. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/21585909051-elemental-so-whats-going-on.html))<br />

Demonic Pact / Totem of Wrath<br />
Yes, we want to fix the discrepancy. We'd like to get it done before Cataclysm. I'm not going to promise we're going to be able to for the reasons I can't and don't ever promise anything. You can see how many shaman have even hung on to my saying &quot;we'd like to fix it by Cataclysm.&quot; I think in the future I'm going to have to be even more careful about saying stuff like that. :(<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure you all know the issue, but for the record (and being brief to the point of being flippant):<br />
<br />
Some shaman are convinced they won't be brought if ToW doesn't compete with or trump DP.<br />
Some Demo locks are convinced they won't be brought if DP doesn't complete with or trump DP. I'm slightly more sympathetic with the locks here, because shaman do have other desirable buffs. I realize this is somewhat subjective though.<br />
Many shaman don't want to have to drop ToW at all. They tend to be happier when a Demo lock comes too. It all depends on how secure they feel with their slot in the raid. In my experience, most players obsess way too much over getting sat. If they are getting sat, it might be a personal performance problem. If their personal performance is good, it might be that their raid leader is misinformed and puts way too much emphasis on a spellpower and crit buff when it's possible to improve their dps by much more in other (more L2P) ways. At the very high end, eeking out a 2 or 3% dps buff can be huge. But even in those guilds, I still see plenty of Elemental and Demonology. My slightly unrelated advice is you'll be happier playing the game if you find a guild less focused on constantly replacing their players.<br />
We are really trying to move away from the &quot;I get a slot because of my awesome buff.&quot; Some days I think we'd be better off with none at all and players just got brought because they were good players. (We're not going to do this, but it would certainly chill out a lot of the raid utility anxiety.) <br />
<br />
[...] The problem, once again, is that many shaman are happy not to have to drop ToW anyway, and Elemental shaman without ToW are probably a lot more attractive than Demo locks without DP, and possibly even if the two were identical. It's going to take a lot of changes to get things more where we want them and if only get in part of the changes, we'll probably be in a worse state than today. As I've said, it's definitely a priority to get it fixed, but we have a very long list of stuff we want to get fixed.

Definetly. But they do seem to be aware that cutscenes can take over, so they might just want to use it for things like the Wrathgate were putting the player in the context would not work for what's going to happen.</div></div><hr />

From what I read, it's not even being looked into. They're aware of some of the issues, and would like to fix them, but as far as that goes elemental shaman shouldn't hold their breath for some time. Maybe next expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
<br />
The Wrath Gate cutscene is also a CG clip, just like the intros to the games, just played mid-game instead of when loading for the first time (or from the login screen), though. It's in your /Data/xxXX/Interface/Cinematics directory along with the intro cinematics. Which is exactly why it won't be added until 3.3.2 (or whichever patch unlocks the last wing of ICC and starts season 8 ) to avoid spoilers for as long as possible, since as soon as the patch comes out with the cutscene, anyone can spoil themselves by simply double-clicking the file (no datamining knowledge required--heck, you don't even need to install Bink or anything, it's an AVI).<br />
<br />
Some people think of cutscenes as engine movies rather than prerendered CG movies. In this case it's prerendered and is also a cinematic, and is only being called a cutscene because it cuts the player abruptly out of the game to play.<br />
<br />
TLDR: Wrath Gate (and the upcoming one for Arthas's death) is both a cinematic and a cutscene, really. They're not mutually exclusive terms.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Did Ghostcrawler really just attribute elemental dps shortfalls to everyone just not knowing how to play? Really? From the guy who told shaman if their reincarnation cooldown is too short, people will start killing themselves to get mana or teleport from their place of death?<br />
<br />
<br />
No, he attributed RAID dps shortfalls to raids not knowing how to play rather than not having the right raid buffs. You specifically avoided quoting the first half of the sentence which gives it the context to show he's talking about raid leader's choices in that instance, not elemental shamans.<br />
<br />
I guess his use of pronouns was a little confusing there. I'll clarify here: &quot;If their [our hypothetical elemental shaman's] personal performance is good, it might be that their [this elemental shaman's] raid leader is misinformed and puts way too much emphasis on a spellpower and crit buff when it's possible to improve their [the hypothetical raid's] dps by much more in other (more L2P) ways.&quot; Hell the first clause in the sentence says if the elemental shaman's dps is already fine, so the ele sham doesn't need to L2P by default in his hypothetical case. Just the rest of the raid does, and them learning to play would increase rdps more than switching from ToW to DP. (Very true in any case except a raid where every single person already plays at the top end and has at least enough casters that ToW -&gt; DP makes up for a warlock's personal dps loss not being destruction.)</div></div><hr />

It's posts like this that make me laugh so hard. They act like they know what's happening inside WoW without any real knowledge. Here's a tip genius, the developers you said made &quot;WoW great&quot; and the developers you said made &quot;WoW bad&quot; are the SAME PEOPLE. The same developers that are making changes now are the same developers that have been designing the game since vanilla. While some new developers have joined the team, the original ones are still there and making decisions.</div></div><hr />

Am I hallucinating memories of a Sunwell cutscene in MGT? I mean, sure you had to click on the orb, but it was required for the quest.<br />
<br />
Also, for the record:<br />
Cinematics are the CGI videos that look super spiffy. They don't ever happen during gameplay.<br />
Cutscenes are the videos rendered with the game engine, and sometimes touched up afterward with effects that aren't possible within the game engine. These happen during gameplay, and cause loss of character control until they finish.<br />
Event Scenes are scripted behaviors like with escort quests or boss fights, where you retain control of your character as the actions happen. These occur fluidly with the rest of the game.</div></div><hr />

Warlocks are fine atm and getting a buff ours regularly pulls over 8.5k on a good beasts and still only has 2 pieces of 258 and our other plays demo and buffs all casters/healers and keeps up scorch. Only people i regularly see above good locks is mages and hunters. The only thing they are lacking atm is a burst cd to use during areas when they want or need to. This is one of the reason that arcane is so high and most serious rogues roll combat. This apparently wont be fixed until cata.<br />

And yeah the whole talk to Shamn i followed it closely and it really gave me no hope.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That aside, i quit playing my Enhancement shaman a while ago. Things that bugged me was when we dropped Magma Totem, it took 2 second for the first tic. To add to that, the boss/mob was often moved out of range before it had time to do half its damage. you could argue that Paladins and Death Knights have the same problem with Con and D&amp;D. However these classes have mobility with their AoE. The 3.3 changes dont really change much, as i have to put down a fire totem before i can use my fire nova.<br />
<br />
Overall, i hated playing my shaman. Even in 5 man HC, i had to drop my totems. you can bet your ass that PUG tank will take no notice of them, and tank them just out of range.<br />

Why not just give Shaman an aura? 40 yards, but able to MOVE.</div></div><hr />

Cinematics are the CGI videos that look super spiffy. They don't ever happen during gameplay.<br />
Cutscenes are the videos rendered with the game engine, and sometimes touched up afterward with effects that aren't possible within the game engine. These happen during gameplay, and cause loss of character control until they finish.<br />

There was a cutscene in MGT. However, Kaplan most likely didn't mean a cutscene that's basically the same thing as the opening monologue for a level 1 character, which is just the camera flying around an area.<br />

What? Can anyone wake him up? I see only one shaman in most of the Top raiding guild. We're lucky to see ToW needed because we would not be there otherwise. There's NO FIGHT where a shaman can top the DPS meters. That's not a L2P factor at all.<br />
<br />
After our first buff in WotLK we were OP, now we are in the bottom most of the time on a same skill/gear level again and no change except AoE in ICC is coming.<br />
And I don't talk about hybrid class when I see pally, druid, etc. be in the top DPS/heal/tank spot.<br />

Sometimes your class is gonna get nerfed, sometimes it's gonna be buffed, sometimes they are gonna have some slight problems with development too. If you have a problem with your class personal dps then you really need to look for a new game because it is always in flux and you are just gonna keep getting mad. Also, as far as survivability goes, if you can't stay alive then you are just bad...end of story. Stop blaming the developers for you getting sat out of raids because if you are a part of a guild that will sit you because of a slight increase in dps then I have no clue how you have fun raiding at all. Find a group of friends, make a guild, and do work without worrying about your &quot;raid spot&quot;.</div></div><hr />

In regards to our fire totems, the only ones of actual use would be; Magma, and ToW.. Searing just doesn't add that much of a DPS bonus, and as rare as Elemental shamans are(good ones) we drop ToW. Then again this is just what I see on my realm.<br />

This is one of the reason that arcane is so high and most serious rogues roll combat. This apparently wont be fixed until cata.<br />
<br />
And lol at quoted poster. you gave up on your class because you couldnt top charts. Guess you couldnt handle affliction at the start of wrath then.<br />

<br />
8.5k is great and all, however when most the mages/rogues and hunters are usually at least 1K higher is doesn't feel great.<br />
<br />
That said if you are getting 8.5k maybe you should post more combat logs to World of Logs, the highest they have a lock sitting at is 8.2k<br />

Now I fully agree with you and I also thing that's the way how the game should be, but sadly this isn't the state the game is in right now. Playing a holy priest myself I get more then pissed with the current situation of my class.<br />
<br />
Check this http://www.worldoflogs.com/rankings/players/Crusaders%27_Coliseum/hps/ and you can count priests on one hand. Druids in abundance, a hybrid class that is healing 3 times better as a holy priest. Check the 25 Heroic logs. Even shamans are above Priests most of the time. As of right now, the priest is the worst healing class in the game, and it boggles me how they could mess this up so badly. <br />
<br />
What is even more annoying that there's no talk about priest problems at all, not from blizzard not from anyone. Everyone just accepts the fact that the situation right now is &quot;fine&quot; and &quot;as it should be&quot;, It's kind of sad really, I enjoyed my priests since the launch of WoW but I'm about to give up and roll a tree.</div></div><hr />

i dont believe it is because priest healing is too low. I think its because Discipline is way OP and the best spec right now for priests and the thing about Disp is they are all about mitigating damage not healing it...So of course Healing priests numbers look low.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So we went from healers to bubble dispensers - in my eyes this is just as bad. Let's be realistic, the priest is the closest we can get to a pure healing class with 2 trees focusing more or less on healing and damage prevention. Yet when put side to side with other classes we perform at best equally or poorer. <br />
<br />
Same gear, proper gemming, proper enchants, same class understanding: there is no way a holy priest will beat a druid in raid healing, at best they will be close to each other, but most of the time the druid will just blow past the priest. Same as above but for tank healing, the Paladin will do a 2 times better job as a disc priest. <br />
<br />
We can throw in shamans too, which I found are performing amazingly well with their chainheal spam. <br />
<br />
I really do believe from my experience and from talking with other priests on my realm, that the Priest is now indeed one of the worst healers there is considering pure numbers. We have our utility and stuff that manages to keep us wanted, but for pure healing number crunching we are the worst and frankly I don't like it a little bit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You are mis-reading.<br />
<br />
We have had NO data at all on the PTR about the Lich King encounter. We HAVE had blue posts saying they are putting delays on releasing the content in icecrown. ie: we get the first 4 bosses on Tuesday(US)/Wednesday(EU) then 3-4 weeks later the next area is opened etc.<br />
<br />
What is exceptionally likely to happen is that sometime in the new year (late Jan/early Feb) we will get a new PTR that will have the season 8 stuff AND the Lich King encounter. It has to be tested after all. They cannot and would not put the iconic encounter of the entire expansion live without any testing.<br />
<br />
Thus expect to see the cinematic during the February/March testing of the new patch that will allow us to deal with the Lich King. When THAT patch goes live (probably late Feb/early March) and probably at the last minute so as not to spoil it they will add the cinematic.<br />
<br />
NB. this would mean that it would be possibly into March before we see the world first Lich King defeat, and thus at that time that the heroic modes would be unlocked. Its a clever move by Blizzard to keep the content going longer whilst they get Cataclysm ready.<br />
<br />
It that holds true I'd be expecting a beta of Cataclysm a few weeks after that eg:in late April/early May at the very earliest. More likely May/June time - with a 4-5 months beta taking us to a Oct/Nov launch date of patch 4.0.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The expectation is that, like with patch 3.2, we'll get the new Season (and the new VoA boss) at the same time as Heroic mode is unlocked. In this case, that's either the week Gate 4 in ICC is opened (and we can actually pull the Lich King) or the week after (we can't start Heroic mode until we've downed the Lich King, and there are no optional bosses). With &quot;several weeks&quot; between gate unlocks, we're looking at 2-ish months.<br />
<br />
There's no reason for the PVP gear not to be on the PTR yet a few days pre-patch. There aren't gonna be any shockers with the stats or set-bonuses (PvP gear stats are pretty much formulaic, according to Ghostcrawler), and I doubt there are spoilers to be had there. Either the patch is a month further off than everyone's expecting, or Season 8 stuff won't be coming with the 3.3.0 patch.</div></div><hr />

Totally agree here, healing meters should only act as guidlines, not as a form of exact measurement.<br />
And yes, priests are the most balanced healers out there. The problem is it's really easy to suck as one.<br />

A resto druid should not even be near the healing done by a holy priest. Why? Hybrid. Same concept should go for DPS. In other words, when you play the game, priest is the &quot;primary&quot; healer to pick and level if you want to be extraordinary at healing done. Of course, we all know that's not true in this current state. As others said previously, a holy priest played at best (which in my opinion takes a lot more to pull off compared to resto healing) still has trouble.<br />
<br />
I still have no idea why druids have it the easiest every expansion.</div></div><hr />

Your assuming of course that they will put the Lich King encounter on the PTR.<br />

And I do believe your also assuming that the testing on the PTR is the only testing they will do for the encounter.<br />

They do have an internal QA team that can test that encounter just fine :)<br />

I myself would be looking into confirming what was said (ie the language used) and how long ago.<br />
<br />
You never know.<br />

They could of changed their minds on how many cut scenes they wanted in there :)</div></div><hr />

Players are simply selfish of their own stats. Who cares if you're not at the top of the charts... add an extra 5% to your own personal performance or add an extra %1 to each of your 24 raid members? Hmmm, do the math here. Which do you think will be the greatest benifit to the raid?<br />
<br />
P.S. Trolls - These numbers are figurative.<br />
<br />
Edit: And I'll add that I agree that their should be more cut scenes in the game. They should however be skippable and never be more than five minutes long because that would just piss everyone off. But for those of us who don't take the time to read up on all the lore, having a short scene for every other quest chain or raid encounter would certainly bring more to capturing the overall story behind this world...of warcraft.</div></div><hr />

Priests have a tool for every situation and are the most balanced healers in the game, they lack the AOE/spam healing of druids but can keep up with them, but have the MT healing capabilities that druids don't have. They lack the MT healing of palis but can keep up with them, but have the AOE healing capabilities that palis don't have.<br />
<br />
I still have no idea with priests think that Blizzard is out to get them, if anything you've gotten the most love.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dude c'mon, equally geared healers and what you see is druids pull 3 million or more as any other healer (healing done, not HPS) per raid instance. It's not an issue of l2p, but the easiness of the druid to hot all the stuff up and let it tick, and the nature of boss fights which are all more or less focusing on raid wide damage just made this game favor druids. <br />
<br />
Either the majority of all priest in my realm, being DISC or HOLY are complete &quot;retards&quot; (but we somehow manage to get everything done what blizzard throws at us) or the Priests are indeed the worst healers of the lot. Biggest trumps of the Priest are Disc Shields/Pain Suppresion and/or Guardian Spirit - take that out and we're the de-facto worst healer in the game - if you fail to see this, then I don't know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have had NO data at all on the PTR about the Lich King encounter. We HAVE had blue posts saying they are putting delays on releasing the content in icecrown. ie: we get the first 4 bosses on Tuesday(US)/Wednesday(EU) then 3-4 weeks later the next area is opened etc.<br />
<br />
What is exceptionally likely to happen is that sometime in the new year (late Jan/early Feb) we will get a new PTR that will have the season 8 stuff AND the Lich King encounter. It has to be tested after all. They cannot and would not put the iconic encounter of the entire expansion live without any testing.<br />
<br />
Thus expect to see the cinematic during the February/March testing of the new patch that will allow us to deal with the Lich King. When THAT patch goes live (probably late Feb/early March) and probably at the last minute so as not to spoil it they will add the cinematic.<br />
<br />
NB. this would mean that it would be possibly into March before we see the world first Lich King defeat, and thus at that time that the heroic modes would be unlocked. Its a clever move by Blizzard to keep the content going longer whilst they get Cataclysm ready.<br />
<br />
It that holds true I'd be expecting a beta of Cataclysm a few weeks after that eg:in late April/early May at the very earliest. More likely May/June time - with a 4-5 months beta taking us to a Oct/Nov launch date of patch 4.0.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tough situation for MMO-Champion...having released info about all patches always...even the first to post &quot;spoilers&quot; on Cata before Blizzcon. <br />

they'd be absolutely stupid not to spoil it, when this whole site is based upon spoilers and providing early information. information regarding arthas shouldn't be different from any other boss in this game just because he was a major part of wc3's terrible story line that ruined the warcraft lore forever. he doesn't deserve special spoiler immunity.</div></div><hr />

the design team has changed. the devs from vanilla or even tbc are gone. check the inside of your wrath booklet vrs your vanilla book.<br />
<br />
different vision and different game now. god I hate people like yourself. learn to read.<br />
<br />
<br />
I actually took you up on that idea. I went back and opened the Vanilla, TBC, and Wrath booklets. I found that a LOT of the original Blizzard staff are still there. The only difference I found is that in TBC and Wrath some developers had changed positions, but just to another developer position. It also looks like they restructured how they offered positions. In Wrath they made 1 leader per department, in TBC and Vanilla there were multiple. Regardless, I did find a lot of the same developers that were also in Vanilla.</div></div><hr />

Playing a holy priest myself I get more then pissed with the current situation of my class.<br />
<br />
Check this http://www.worldoflogs.com/rankings/players/Crusaders%27_Coliseum/hps/ and you can count priests on one hand. Druids in abundance, a hybrid class that is healing 3 times better as a holy priest. Check the 25 Heroic logs. Even shamans are above Priests most of the time. As of right now, the priest is the worst healing class in the game, and it boggles me how they could mess this up so badly. <br />
<br />
What is even more annoying that there's no talk about priest problems at all, not from blizzard not from anyone. Everyone just accepts the fact that the situation right now is &quot;fine&quot; and &quot;as it should be&quot;, It's kind of sad really, I enjoyed my priests since the launch of WoW but I'm about to give up and roll a tree.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe if you are holy....try checking overhealing meters. In my experiance I am usualy at the bottom. And as someone else already said....we have a spell for every situation. I am playing priest my self...and I still think they are the best healing class around. And stop worrying about healing metters. <br />
1st it depends who you heal...tank or the raid<br />
2nd if the raid survive...it's not number 1 who did the job alone<br />
3rd like I said...check overhealing<br />
4th.....I dont think this topic is about priests</div></div><hr />

&quot;Have spells for every situation&quot; is a lie. It was once true though. What was the last time you use GH as holy? Priest is the only class forced to switch tree to perform another healing assigment, while shammy and druid isnt. Although not as well as pally, they can heal tank w/ the same healing tree used for everyday raid healing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After our first buff in WotLK we were OP, now we are in the bottom most of the time on a same skill/gear level again and no change except AoE in ICC is coming.<br />
And I don't talk about hybrid class when I see pally, druid, etc. be in the top DPS/heal/tank spot.<br />
<br />
We need a Buff but what will we get? Almost nothing and nerf on our T9. Awesome<br />
We're back at the Buffing Class with Lower(too low) DPS situation. Thx Blizzard<br />
<br />
<br />
I share your opinion, though the main cause for Elementals dropping behind as we progress further and further in gear compared to other dps:ers is because they failed yet again to make Elementals scale properly with gear.<br />
<br />
Now I'm able to pull pretty good DPS and so is my Co Elemental in the guild (yes we are a rare x2 Elemental guild) but still we pull one of the shorter straw when it comes to being useful in progress raiding. Dps however aint the only thing that counts, survivability does as well. A dead dps:er is useless. As Elemental I can chose to sacrifice my DPS to heal myself and stay alive, if shit hit the fan so to speak.</div></div><hr />

But really this blue post made me LOLz in real life, cause a lock no matter what the spec will always get a raid spot over an elemental shaman. My guild runs with 2 to 3 locks or more most of the time, where we bring only 1 shaman for heroism. Shamans are still the weakest dps of all hybrid classes</div></div><hr />

Hey, it's Yarong. I got banned in that piece of shit thread where GC basically made my pessimism seem like god forsaken clairvoyance. 9 freakin' days. You know why? Because when he threatened to leave thread until the venting stopped, I said this:<br />
<br />
Oh, honestly....<br />
<br />
Fine take you're red wagon. Ele's are leaving in droves because you won't address issues that are real. It's not like anything's getting fixed now, ANYWAY, so your future potential, maybe, kinda sorta plans for a year out aren't terribly material NOW.<br />
<br />
THEN you make a post which is basically, L2P, &quot;find a guild that won't replace your gimp spec&quot; and &quot;we don't see it as a big deal, so it must not be&quot;.<br />
<br />
Golly gee willickers, Mr. Beseiged Crab. Why's everyone so upset with you???<br />
<br />
They don't want folks to actually debate or bring ideas. I mean, Strawberry alone has had at least 3-4 ideas that are super solid and would be great for the spec. Other than appreciating that Straw never feels compelled to call &quot;Bullshit&quot; when it clearly is, nothing straw's done or anyone else has done has changed one damn thing. They want the DD forums to be like the Elitist Jerks forums... except on EJ, if you make a valid argument, you don't get banned or deleted. GC made clear they like certain things like our knuckleheaded-turribul fire totem mechanics. Didn't mention how retarded the FE AI is.... or the random targeting of Searing... or how ridiculous it is to be close enough to drop magma.<br />
<br />
I dunno. It was a bitch move and his closing and deleting threads now only proves that Ele is dead unless you like the Dev's plan. No scaling for the rest of LK. No ToW/DP fix. Still a lack of ICC Ele gear. If dood wants folks to take his statements seriously, he ought to be willing to withstand on-point rebuttals and stop responding to the snarky posts and respond to the actual rebuttals, which he doesn't do. When folks bring up scaling for the umpteenth time...nothing. Rather than actually TALK about Fire totem mechanics, he says &quot;we like it&quot; and well, dammit, that's the end of it. <br />
<br />
As of now, the WoW forums are where good ideas go to die. <br />
<br />
You'd think all the retirements woulda caught his attention. Instead, he wants to chide us that they know what's best. Sheeeeeeeit. If they really knew what was best, FN wouldn't have been the only Ele change in 3.3. It wouldn't have been changed at all.<br />
<br />
I'm glad for all the time I put into that char and sad to be leaving all that hard work behind, but looking forward to the challenge of playing my rogue. If I just suck at it (which so far in Ony 10 with a 1600 wow-heroes GS, I pulled 3.2k, so not bad...), I'll have to figure something else out cuz I'm not raiding mainly as a shaman until they fix the class. <br />
<br />
OH, and you heard it here first... Cata won't be the massive reworking most folks are hoping for. It'll be talent tweaks, but no class revamps. So if anyone's looking at Cata to &quot;fix&quot; anything shaman... stop. It's not. <br />
<br />
Ele is a take or leave it proposition. If anything, I think the Besieged, softshelled crab made that perfectly clear.</div></div><hr />
