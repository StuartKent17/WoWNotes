Log on <br />
#mmo-champion on irc.quakenet.org (irc://irc.quakenet.org/mmo-champion) and ask me (Bibi) to get your account activated.<br />
Of course, you can just register a new account.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This also means that registrations on PvPScene.com forums (http://www.pvpscene.com/index.php?action=forum) was affected by the same bug, and was fixed as well. <br />
<br />
<br />
2.4 Interface changes<br />
It's been confirmed that the combat log API will be totally changed in 2.4, what does it mean ? Basically it will be much easier to write and add features to fight analysis like combat logs parsers, damage meters, and probably a few other things that I can't think of.<br />
The combat logging mechanism is completely overhauled with explicit data instead of text strings delivered to the UI. See slouken's post below for a sneak-peak at some of the current details. Highlights include detailed flags indicating relationship of involved units to player, unique identifiers for units with the same name within the combat log -- great for log analysis.<br />

There is currently a database issue preventing talents from properly updating, it's being worked on. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2971963238&amp;postId=30553507704&amp;sid=1#2))<br />

Arena : Season 4<br />
The season 3 won't last forever, a season 4 is scheduled. Items from season 3 with personal rating will possibly lose their rating requirements when it starts but nothing is confirmed yet.

The tanking gear in Zul'aman is here to provides more options for players, this is why some pieces are missing defense rating at the expense of other useful stats like hit rating or stamina.

Errr ... why they are already thinking about it? Okay. That would confirm a new set (T7?) in one of the future patches cause without a new Tier, they couldn't copy one for the arena-gear :P yay!<br />
And as we all know they are too lazy to design an arena-only-set.<br />

I can't recall this exactly but didn't they say explicitly before that there will be NO tier sets in Sunwell?<br />

Erm... I think VE wasn't consumed because bonus reduces mana cost for 150 and VE costs less than 150. I think it was told in official WoW Priest forum. Yet another SPriest nerf :).</div></div><hr />

Now all that gear has +hit rating and as a retri u dun dual weild and thus don't need it. But saying this gear will be for retri might mean that retri will get some changes (probably in 2.4) so that the armor will match with the stats a retri pala wil then need. Ofcourse this is pure specualtion, but the blue post mi9ght be nice to add in todays update :D</div></div><hr />

^totally wrong, Sunwell = Tier 7, basically the Naxxramas of WotLK (a new instance/tier right b4 an xpac, that is slightly pointless)</div></div><hr />

<br />
And what do you base that on? It was stated at Blizzcon that we won't see Tier 7 before WOTLK, which considering Sunwell was pencilled to have 5-6 bosses (now 6-8) seems pretty logical.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I remember this aswell. No Tier7 before WoTLK. On the other hand though, they also said that players will be at least level 100 when engaging Arthas ::)<br />
<br />
What the folks at Blizzard plan never turns out to be the final product :P</div></div><hr />
