Druids Barkskin changes<br />
Zolphea, a German Online Community Representative posted on the official forums and posted something that will probably make a few druids happy. <br />

Seems a tad silly to me that Dire Bear form isn't given the same. As it stands you can't use Barkskin in any form, unless humanoid, then it stays on for 8 seconds. By the time I have popped Barkskin, Dire Form, and pulled it's effect has gone. Shouldn't they add it to Direbear form, or would that be considered a tad imbalanced for PvP?<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
<br />
I re-thought this. A bear can have 75% damage reduction (it caps at 75% from what I remember). If they added it to bear form that would be 95% damage reduction. I think I understand now why it can't be in Dire Bear form, we'd be super tanks when Barkskin had cooled down.<br />

You still have the 1.5s global CD after Barskin before you can switch into Bear, don't you?<br />

<br />
You can't just add the values :p<br />
It's more like 80% total reduction: 25% gets through from armor cap, 80% from Barskin -&gt; 0.25*0.8 = 0.2 -&gt; 80%</div></div><hr />

No, because daggers are in a different normalization 'category' than the other 1 handers are. IIRC daggers are normalized to 1.8 or 1.7 speed or something.</div></div><hr />

There is already very little you can do to stop a good Resto Druid + Arms Warrior with a Mace. I have no idea how you're going to be able to down them in 2.3, the class has no real weaknesses left. So much CC immunity, two forms of proper CC when no other healer has one, so many instants, dispel protection up the ying yang, mucho survivability and battlefield control, tons of unique utility abilities! I wish I hadn't dropped mine back in AQ40. All I got is that ugly Sartura hat to show for it! <br />
<br />
Priest still has plenty of holes. <br />
<br />
Paladins are the easiest class in the game to shut down and control with no instants along with having nearly no offensive utility <br />
<br />
Shamans who have lots of offensive utility in shocks, totems and heroism but are destroyed by pressing Dispel and removing the PvP bandaid that is Earth Shield.<br />
<br />
Really awkward changes, I personally think Resto Shamans and Holy Paladins need to be seeing some of their own buffs since the other two healing classes are getting so many mitigation buffs. <br />
<br />
Perhaps Earth Shield dispelable by the charge only for Resto Shamans + procs off magic, and I dunno what to do for Paladin, I think Lay on Hands is entirely archaic at this point, and wouldn't be too much as a 5 minute cooldown. Maybe add that Improved Holy Shock HoT idea that's been kicked around too (powerful HoT/DoT tacked onto the Holy Shock)<br />
<br />
Paladins need to be taken outside the now dispellable bubble, and Shamans... well... Blizzard just loves to kick them in the ass.<br />
<br />
TBQH though, I acutally think healers might be getting too powerful all around, heh.</div></div><hr />

They can push out the patch and then reset the arena ratings and make s3 gear available a week later. <br />

Since Blizzard always says &quot;we never announce our patches in advance&quot; it kind of contradicts the &quot;we'll give you a two week notice before season 3 starts&quot;, so I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't happen at the same time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hemo dagger will be and has always been terrible. Daggers have a different normalization and on top of that, just because the normalization would give you some extra damage through AP (if it would have shared normalization with other one handers, which it doesn't) still won't make it better than doing the same with a weapon with a better damage range.<br />
<br />
And lethality is overrated as hell, don't mourn the loss of it :P (I also fail to see how hemo dagger would have better combo generation than hemo with a mace?)</div></div><hr />

No we wont.<br />
Blizz have also stated that S3 wont launch at same time as patch 2.3.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gougeripper</div><div class="date">2007-11-07, 11:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can someone tell me why Hemo Dagger rogues fail?<br />
<br />
Why are Hemo even in sub tree if it sucks for daggers?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skugga</div><div class="date">2007-11-08, 04:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can someone tell me why Hemo Dagger rogues fail?<br />
<br />
Up 'til now, hemo has sucked for daggers because it has been based on weapon speed according to the formula<br />
Damage = Weapon damage + ( AP/14 ) * Weapon speed, which means that a slow weapon ( speed 2.8 ) will gain about 55% extra bonus damage compared to a 1.8 speed dagger. ( 2.8/1.8 ). And on top of that add the fact that the dagger's base damage is a lot lower than the slower weapon.<br />
<br />
Now, let's say we have 1600 ap and Rod of the Sun King from Kael'Thas (http://thottbot.com/i29996)<br />
Our average hemo damage would be: ( 270.5 + ( 1600/14) * 2.8 ) = 590.5 dmg<br />
<br />
Let's say we instead play around using the dagger Boundless Agony from Azgalor (http://thottbot.com/i30901)<br />
The damage would then be: ( 180.5 + ( 1600/14 ) * 1.8 ) = 386.2 dmg<br />
Both weapons picked to be about equal in juiciness =)<br />
<br />
590.5/35 = 16.87 damage per energy<br />
386.2/35 = 11.03 damage per energy<br />
<br />
In terms of energy efficiency, using a low-damage, high-speed weapon for an attack which benefits from the opposite is just bad.<br />
<br />
For the 2.3 patch, it will be changed and yes, it WILL remove the part with the weapon speed which means one less factor of crappiness, but no, it's still based on weapon damage. <br />
<br />
Yes you can stunlock as well with a hemo spec with dagger as one with another weapon, but the damage you will output will be too low to make it worthwhile.<br />
<br />
For daggers there is Mutilate and there is Backstab. Mutilate is awesome for its great damage per energy ratio, combined with the extreme combo point generation, so please, don't go hemo dagger or I'll haunt you forever ;)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gougeripper</div><div class="date">2007-11-08, 08:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So when 2.3 comes, hemo dagger rogue is still not worth it?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skugga</div><div class="date">2007-11-08, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all I need to correct an error in my above post... Rod of the Sun King has speed 2.7, so the true value should be ( 270.5 + ( 1600/14) * 2.7 ) = 579.07 dmg, giving a damage-per-energy ratio of 16.54. <br />
<br />
And no, hemo dagger rogue still won't be worth it. Instead the effectivity of hemo using sword or mace will increase dramatically (Hemo got seriously gimped in TBC. Since it doesn't scale with AP well enough, Sinister has been far superior to Hemo in efficiency until one reaches an extreme amount of attack power). This will result in me playing AR/hemo even in raids, which means I'll save a lot of money from not having to respecc all the time ;)</div></div><hr />
