<br />
<br />
We appreciate the spirited discussion on the topic of flying. The subject has brought out passionate viewpoints and sparked insightful conversations on our official forums and blogs, on community sites, and in chat channels. Your feedback has been a valuable part of the ongoing conversations within Blizzard as well, and today, we’d like to share some updated plans for how we’ll handle flight going forward.<br />
<br />
The Thrill of Discovery<br />
At the heart of the initial plan to restrict flight in Draenor (even after players reach level 100) lies the design goal of providing the best moment-to-moment gameplay possible in the outdoor world. From navigating the lava flows of the Molten Front in Patch 4.2, to breaching the Thunder King’s stronghold in Patch 5.2, to reaching the heights of the Ordon Sanctuary on Timeless Isle in Patch 5.4, to uncovering secrets deep within Gorgrond’s jungles on Draenor, World of Warcraft is full of memorable moments that are only possible when players explore the world by ground. And as we’ve continued to develop content over the years, we’ve focused more and more on providing players with these kinds of experiences.<br />
<br />
However, while we firmly believe that keeping your feet on the ground is a key part of discovery in WoW, we also recognize that breaking free from those restrictions can be fun and rewarding as well, especially for those who’ve already fully experienced the game’s world content. With that in mind, we’re planning some changes in the near future that will allow players to enjoy their hard-earned flying mounts in Draenor—in a way that doesn’t compromise the excitement of ground-based exploration.<br />
<br />
Mastering the Outdoor World<br />
In an upcoming Public Test Realm build, we will be introducing a new meta-achievement called Draenor Pathfinder. You’ll earn this achievement in Patch 6.2 by mastering the outdoor environment of Draenor—exploring Draenor’s zones (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/8935-explore-draenor), collecting 100 treasures in Draenor (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/9728-grand-treasure-hunter), completing the Draenor Loremaster (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/9923-loremaster-of-draenor) and Securing Draenor (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/9562-securing-draenor) achievements, and raising the three new Tanaan Jungle reputations to Revered. Initially, this achievement will award a rylak mount: the Soaring Skyterror, one of the native beasts that roam Draenor’s skies. Players will remain ground-bound on Draenor until a small follow-up patch (6.2.x), when all players who have earned Draenor Pathfinder on at least one character will unlock the ability to fly in Draenor on all their level 90+ characters.<br />
<br />
We believe this strikes the right balance between ensuring ground-based content lives up to its full potential, while providing players who’ve already fully experienced Draenor’s outdoor world extra freedom to “break the rules.” This also provides a general blueprint going forward for content to come. Players will explore new and undiscovered lands from the ground, and then once they’ve fully mastered those environments—a notion that continues to evolve with each new expansion—they can take to the skies and experience the world from a new vantage point.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your heartfelt feedback. We’ll see you in (and soon, above) Tanaan Jungle.<br />
<br />

Armory Stats - Flying Achievements<br />
While not all of the flying related achievements are in, we can take a look at how people are doing on each achievement before everyone knew they would be required to fly. The used sample is 1.8 million players that have logged in since May 1.<br />

It gets players out into the world in order to complete the achievement and get a tangible, worthwhile reward at the end (Flying).<br />
It still ensures that players complete all current 'content' without trivialising it through flying.<br />
and, I really like the added bonus of it being account wide, so that levelling on alts will become a different experience compared with ground questing.<br />
<br />
Personally very happy with the changes tbh.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JohnnyQuest</div><div class="date">2015-06-10, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The perfect solution, really. Players are forced to experience all of the content as intended by Blizzard, and then when they're done their whole account can fly. Personally I'd say this is an even better solution than unlocking flying at max level.</div></div><hr />

True, but it does show Blizz is actually capable of compromise. I knew they could if they WANTED to.</div></div><hr />

They never had intentions of ever grounding the game. They come back as &quot; We listened&quot; Here is compromise.<br />
<br />
What a joke.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dristereau</div><div class="date">2015-06-10, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good change. Glad they didn't ignore flying completely. Should have been available in 6.0 with something like this, but 6.2.x isn't a bad idea either. Also we get a Rylak mount, which I haven't seen besides the store. Makes sure people explore and then allows you to skip after. In my case, with an armada of 100 Alts (20ish), I'm happy for this to exist.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trassk</div><div class="date">2015-06-10, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have always leveled though the 'experience' when we level our characters, except for cata, we have always been ground bound, and forced to level up and grind gold in able to fly. Fly has never impacted the leveling experience, because it has never been part of it.<br />
<br />
perfect balance my ass, these cowards can't even admit to their own mistakes in saying the shit they thought everyone would agree with. Backed into a corner much?</div></div><hr />

I look...forward...to seeing people start &quot;discussing&quot; the fact they will have to do dailies to unlock flying though. Just when Dailies start coming back as a rep gain tool, they throw something important on them. Hopefully it won't result in another MoP pendulum swing.</div></div><hr />

It enforces experiencing the world design and gates flying better than just hitting max-level for the expansion. I especially like the fact that it can be gained on one's main and then applies to alts (where you likely would have no desire to repeat all these steps again for a character you don't tend to play as often). Well-crafted compromise to please both sides, aside from those who couldn't be pleased regardless of what was done.</div></div><hr />

Now, we have at least the possibility to fly in Draenor, yes, this will be hard, it will be long (for raising the factions), but there we are: flying in Draenor, and it is really a good new.<br />
At least, for those who play on PVP realms, they will be able to play without being constantly annoyed by the worst of the humanity; good news, good news.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, they do listen. They have since Day 1. People complained in classic about 40 man raids and how they couldn't field one, or would lose players to poaching. in BC they made it 25 man. Then people whined about it. They made the 10 man option in Wrath, gear easier to obtain (later in the expac)... which people wanted. They complained about that. They wanted harder dungeons, Blizzard gave it to them in Cata... the cryfest began about them being &quot;too hard&quot;. Players wanted Pandaren forever, they get it and the QQ was strong. Players cried about &quot;being forced to do too many dailies&quot; so now we have the amount we have in Warlords... and now people complained about that. Now flying's being put in, because people whined about it. Guarantee you there will be threads now that Blizzard is enabling flying, that said they don't want it in and shouting at Blizzard for &quot;caving in&quot;. Blizzard can't win.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really glad they folded though. It will make allot of people happy. Still a better solution would be to design content with flying in mind at max level after doing the quests. You could hide treasures under water or even in the air/caves and things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the idea is, in an MMO, the ability to fly pretty much kills a lot of the things that make an MMO interesting, like world pvp, the value of gathering materials (to be fair garrisons killed that), dealing with... you know actual mobs that can kill you, as well as over simplifying quests by allowing you to just fly to the place where they are at. Essentially they are watering down the game to appease people that probably shouldn't be playing an MMO in the first place. Those that suffer are the ones that actually enjoy MMO's.</div></div><hr />

I honestly don't give a fuck if flying is implemented or not. I just want them to pick an stance on a major issue and follow through. That's what being an adult is like.

Well, I guess next Blizz info, we'll get WoW back to 10 mi+ players? Since people said that the only reason to leave WoW was no-fly in Draenor... (and some &quot;lack of content&quot;, well, flying is content! hahaha).</div></div><hr />

The reason is and was and always will be; the zones weren't finished the world was built with flight in mind after reaching cap, but they couldn't release it because we'd see how unfinished it all really was at the time. I have no hate, but I don't buy any of the surface excuses. Especially because this confirms the Draenor was designed with flight in mind. Still I'll take it and I like the route they chose I think it plays to both camps really well and I always enjoy a nice attunement. The tanaan reps part sorta sucks, but I bet getting to revered is pretty damn simple. Hats off to blizz PR and development for handling it this way and covering their asses and taking the heat for it. A big boo to the false reasons, but still glad its coming back and glad its gated. I do think letting your 90s fly right out of the gate is a little overpowered, but hey go for it. I think the pre-req should be level 98 or 100, but that is just me and I'm pro-flight.<br />
This is the biggest load of bull shit EVER.<br />

Funnily there is an item that lets you fly, already, in every single zone.<br />

<br />
Let me preface this with this: this is a good solution. Will it bring me back? No, flying wasn't high on my list. Whatevs.<br />
<br />
Okay, now to my comments - I don't see this as a compromise. I see this as a major defeat to the devs who were shoving the issue down player's throats, despite MONTHS of outcry. I suspect a higher up may have forced this, based off of plummeting sub reports. To release this 3 days before the Q&amp;A? Says to me Ion is butthurt and doesn't discuss the issue at all, because he lost, so they put out a generic watercooler post, and I bet he doesn't address this at all now. <br />
<br />
And, more importantly, this is hilarious! I said two weeks ago if they went back on their decision, it was going to be embarrassing - and it is. They polarized the community to the point of people attacking each other viciously over the issue, and created months of drama and frustration and bad feelings...for nothing. Way to go, devs. Stir up the hornet's nest for no reason. Bumbling idiots. Now, we can expect campaigns to remove LFR and any other aspect of the game, and Blizzard has set the precedent. They've proven they cannot stick to their own decisions. They have shown weakness, and it's going to get a lot worse from now on. I can only imagine the eye rolling and smirks around the game industry over this. <br />
<br />
The worst part? <br />
<br />
They expect gratitude for this. Fuck you, devs. You could have done this 6 months ago.</div></div><hr />

It dropped off the main page with only one response saying all flyers should just unsub to get flying back and 4 downvotes. Only difference mine had was that I suggested requiring the Double Agent achievement (for level 100 anyway) and not reps since those are so incredibly boring these days. I'm sure others made similar suggestions before I did. Rather funny that what I suggested ended up being close to what was implemented and I got downvoted for suggesting it! Now people are HAPPY this is how we get flying back? Hypocrites. -_-<br />
<br />
At any rate, Blizzard still has a LOT of damage to make up for. Doing a 180 on flying won't be enough to get my trust back, and people shouldn't just suddenly trust them again. If they pulled this once, what's to stop them from doing it again? What's to stop them from yanking something else? People should be leery of trusting Blizzard going forward because history tends to repeat itself. They will do it again. Question is when and with what.</div></div><hr />

I also thing getting flying back as an option is great.<br />
<br />
However, even as a very big fan of flying, I do think it would be better if they made it 90+, not 100+. Being able to fly while levelling would be a huge advantage over others. Some people may not consider that fair.<br />

<br />
this is a dangerous precedent<br />
<br />
Grow up this isn't caving to demands. The entire continent of Draenor was built to facilitate flight in the actual coding and design otherwise this wouldn't even be possible without redoing the entire world (similar to the old world after Cata's launch). The only reason for no flight was gating the fact that Tanaan was empty. Look at Spire's it is practically developed for being able to fly because on land it is easily the worst designed zone they've ever done being up there with Netherstorm on a ground mount. The reason for the postponement of no-flight is simple; they weren't ready with the expansion. A common theme this entire expansion. <br />
<br />
Look at the content for 6.1 and 6.2....how much of what is there should have been launch features? Selfie cam, easily a launch feater, Timewalker easily launch, Flight after a lengthy achievement could easily have been launch especially with the lack of any place for WPVP in the new content. Mythic Dungeons I think always were supposed to come late as a catch up mechanic, but hopefully they'll get the memo and have Mythics at the start and just release less 5 mans on launch and stagger them out over the expansion. They didn't cave to anything they always intended for flight to be there they just didn't have the content ready for folks to fly and they were going to gate it anyways as they normally do and should do at the start of an expansion (I think letting 90 alts fly is too soon imo even after achievement). They let it go on long enough and gauged the backlash, but I'm sure the split was close to 50/50 on not wanting it and wanting it and I think 90% of folks really just wanted it gated in some fashion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It wasn't that genius of a solution, really. It's pretty simple - it's fine as a solution, but not one that took months of research and design to come to. I suspect this was mandated from higher up - &quot;We're bleeding subs like crazy. Fix it. NOW. I don't care about your &quot;vision&quot;, we're going under, fuck your ego.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's a big deal when one of the leads of the game is repudiated from their pretty solid decision a couple of weeks ago, that he laid out in the press. Ion did not leave any doubts in people's minds that it was negotiable. I suspect the &quot;conversation&quot; internally there was not pleasant. <br />
<br />
I can only hope Morhaime or Brack or Chilton are stepping in and telling the devs to get their acts together. I could be wrong, but a reversal like this? This had to come from the higher ups.</div></div><hr />

Actually, I'd be okay with that. I've always said that levelling and end game require different mind sets, so I'd be quite happy for flight to only be available at 100, after unlocking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You mean besides say removing LFR, removing Pvp, shutting the game down, not releasing content at all, if getting to a place faster after 6 months of the expansion is your idea of the worst decision ever for a game you are pretty blinded by your hate for something that you can choose to ignore. If you are still leveling at this point I don't think flight is going to hurt your rush to be faster than someone else.</div></div><hr />

If 6.2 is the last major content patch (read: open-world content), then it is when the achievement and flying should be allowed.<br />
Giving it at launch would have simply trivialized Tanaan and everything to come, as well as the other alternative things (like treasure finding and such).<br />
Sure, those things may not strike everyone's fancy, but like in every expansion prior, once you fly, you skip over and leave any sense of danger behind, as in, find the mob, flying directly down to it, kill it, then fly away.<br />
Leveling alone shouldn't be the only ground time, and I hope they keep this trend going forward, where you do the open world content as designed first, then enjoy the benefits of flying after.</div></div><hr />

They had no intention of keeping it no fly. Look at the world, would you waste design time making the world flight accessable if you had no intention of allowing flight in the zones? Why even bother with it? Please quit over the ability to get somewhere faster after 8 months of an expansion. Cause this is going to affect you greatly.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard picked the stance they felt would lead to less people unsubscribing.<br />

If 6.2 is the last major content patch (read: open-world content), then it is when the achievement and flying should be allowed.<br />
Giving it at launch would have simply trivialized Tanaan and everything to come, as well as the other alternative things (like treasure finding and such).<br />
Sure, those things may not strike everyone's fancy, but like in every expansion prior, once you fly, you skip over and leave any sense of danger behind, as in, find the mob, flying directly down to it, kill it, then fly away.<br />
Leveling alone shouldn't be the only ground time, and I hope they keep this trend going forward, where you do the open world content as designed first, then enjoy the benefits of flying after.<br />
<br />
My hope is they release all the content like Tanaan at the start and have little islands like Timelost and Isle of thunder in the big patch's along with new instances like wrath for catch up (FoS, HoF, HoR) along with mythic versions of these instances. Maybe some gating even on these little islands so when everything's done you can even fly on those.<br />

I'd like to see open world flight content. Spots you couldn't get to or see without flight. Caves high in mountains, hidden stuff on floating islands shit like that. A good mix, but I agree flight should come well after leveling is done and I also agree at launch was never going to happen then again flight at launch has only existed once and that was Cata so anyone expecting it was going to be wrong anyways and they've gated it a little more each time recently. Cloudserpant riding skill alone was a test bed to see if players would actually seek out flight on different mounts gated behind a challenge and it worked so they figured they could actually gate flight behind something besides a vendor and 1k gold. Flight in BC was brutal because it was expensive at a time when gold had value. Wrath had zones that required flight to really manuver around in. Cata went too easy on us and then MoP started drifting back in the right direction. WoD is a symptom of a lot of issues and I think next expansion we'll see it handled really well. Now if only they can get it right with the next iteration of garrisons we might be in a pretty good spot next expansion, but that is me being hopeful.</div></div><hr />

Lets be honest, the anti-flyers are not likely to un-sub because flying is coming back. A lot of the pro-flyers WERE actively un-subbing because of no-flying.<br />

The fact that flying becomes a reward from an achievement makes doing those assaults actually worthwhile IMO. I'm glad this is the compromise they came up with. It lets Blizz have their way with us being grounded to do the content the first time, it doesn't involve them having to actually DO anything engaging with content regarding flying (which is sad but I am sure they are happy with that), it presents Flying as a reward and thus the journey to get it becomes a goal that incentivizes players to engage in content they might otherwise ignore to unlock it, and its account wide which gives the effort value and improves the account value overall IMO.<br />
<br />
My only issues is the rep requirements. Three grindy reps kinda sucks.<br />
<br />
With that said... If flying is only accessible at the tail end of each xpac... it's about the same as no flying at all so I hope that's not their intent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Being neutral from the start about the whole flying thing it didn't bother me one way or another that we didn't have it.<br />
<br />
That being said I am happy that it is making a return to the game and being gated the way it is. In my opinion it is a lot more meaningful to obtain flight through exploring the world instead of paying a sum of gold. While some of the content is not the best we have ever had this task isn't too difficult. It's good that Blizzard listened to the feedback provided by the community and overall I think that this is a change for the better, as it will draw in some of the people who left over flight.<br />
<br />
I find this all a little bittersweet though. While this change is something that should of happened it makes me wonder how much Blizzard is willing to stand it's ground when the next big issue comes up. Blizzard burned a lot of customers with the original announcement of no flight, and while some will come back the damage has been done.<br />
<br />

I still think a lot of people won't be back and even more to leave, because most have not even done half of the stuff required. Money always in the end speaks volumes, they saw the bleeding and they had no choice but to make some sort of compromise. In the end, Blizzard does not really win and the players that actually play the game as intended get reward for the time they put into it. I always do the content, whether I enjoy it or not, because it can eventually come back to bite you in the butt for not doing so. <br />
<br />
I am still going to play FFXIV more than WOW, because I bought both the current game and the expansion weeks ago and since I do not raid anymore in WoW, it really does not hold my attention like it once did. I just do not enjoy the Timeless Isle way they do content now and it was why I bought FFXIV in the first place, it had nothing to do with whether I could fly or not. I would rather have content every day of the week that is engaging and enjoyable to want to do repeatedly, Timeless just does not provide either of those.</div></div><hr />

People like to bring up dailies, which are only interesting the first time - are you saying you actually enjoyed having a Klaxxi pick you up and fly you around for 10 minutes 4 times a week?

None of it was compelling, but all of it was the reason blizz quoted as a reason for no flying. It was a reason touted by players to keep no flying. Now the no flying community wants to complain about the achieves and that they let flying back? The only thing in that achievement list that wasn't touted as a reason for being grounded is Wpvp which is in the same state it as before.

<br />
Ironically, this is the worst possible solution they could implement. Sure they added flying, but they did it in such a way that it is not WORTH IT. They also ensured that I will NEVER resubscribe to their freaking game.</div></div><hr />

Not really, they're faster than the other reps and it doesn't really take long to get to Revered only. If you just do the daily quest parts you'll probably have it by the time 6.2.X comes out without additional grinding.<br />

They actually give the reps a meaning, and value now, tho. It's better than before - and trust me, it hurts to say that, because I agree, the reps are mindless &quot;fill the bar&quot; grinds. <br />
<br />
A better solution, not that this one is that bad, would to build a major quest line, like Wrathion's, with flying as the reward, as Bashiok referenced before 6.1. <br />

It's one thing to go from point A to point B with just &quot;go kill 20,000 mobs&quot;, and to do the journey withe some story and play attached to it.</div></div><hr />

Never ever again do I want to hear people whine and bitch about &quot;Blizzard ignores us&quot;. That being said, I wonder what the next excuse will be when there's a mass exodus in WoW. Can't blame flying now. Oh well, no flying was fun while it lasted.<br />
<br />
<br />
Had they not seen the money walking out the door, they would have never compromised. Money makes the world go round and it also makes less people employee and someone would of had to be sacrifice, if the accounts would bled like there is no tomorrow. I still don't think the recover as much as they will have lost over this stupid PR stunt. People are still not going to trust them and they can still back off from putting flying in by making some sort of excuse. <br />
<br />
I think many will do most of this while still looking back over there shoulders, to make sure what Blizzard means, is actually what they means. They changed so much in this expansion from what was shown over two Blizzcon's, so it not like they can't change their minds again. <br />
<br />
The way this whole thing was handle from the start will be something Blizzard remember for along time. I am sure in the end they will lose far more than they will now gain, because of the trust issue alone. Once someone feels burned, they usually don't come back for more of the same.<br />
<br />
<br />
Addition: How exactly is this going to play out on a PVP realm with the people that don't end up bothering to do all this hoop jump to get flying back? Some people are going to have flying and others without and and the ones without are going to get ganked like there is no tomorrow. I on a normal realm, so this whole thing does not present an issue for me, but it will sure do so to others that do not even play the game to the level I play it as someone that enjoys doing all this type of content. I think, like other things that Blizzard has done in the past. The details have not been fully iron out, which means in the end like every other bright idea like this it is doomed the fail before it even get's started, because at the end of the day it is really about money and not enjoy the game or having fun. <br />

<br />
One faction is done almost entirely through daily quests. The hunters one is done through a combination of a daily giving 1000 rep, a weekly giving 3500 rep and grinding mobs for additional rep each (it's a higher gain than it was in the 6.0 reps).<br />
<br />
The third faction is the hardest one because it's an elite area with mobs you have to group up for. Guess that'll be the one people struggle with most.</div></div><hr />

That and the fact that it will go live at some unnamed point in the future.

If you buy into this shit, you're just telling Blizzard that you will literally pay them for wasting your time on non-gameplay shit and then thank them for wasting more of it later for making you play parts of the game that if you aren't done with already are clearly parts of the game you don't want to fuck with.</div></div><hr />

Yep, and your one comment from the encounter designer proves your point as well. I mean why develop the world for flight if you knew from day one you wouldn't have flying. Go a head and think it was just community whine that got it. Maybe I'll put my blinders on and say something like 8 years of whining got flight taken away for 8 months or we can go with the actual logical explanation the content wasn't done at launch and flight was always planned. But hey keep thinking its only the community. Then again if it took 8 years of whine to get it removed and 8 months to realize it was a mistake I'll take that. But I'm more inclined to believe it was planned all along, because I don't think the blizz devs just shoot from the hip and I'm more inclined to think they actually have a vision and long term plan in place. But hold on to that, its whine that go it changed either time mentality if it makes you feel better or convinces you to quit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally I like the idea. I was neutral on flying (like I enjoyed flying but it never affected whether or not I wanted to play) and didn't miss it at all this expansion. I don't mind at all the idea of flying being gated. In the future they could set it up to include achievements from every patch so it always unlocks with the final patch of the expansion. This is great for leveling alts at the end of the expansion and for leveling them to get to the new expansion when it comes out. <br />
