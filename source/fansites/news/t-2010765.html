Legion - Bringer of the Light<br />
During the Order Hall campaign, someone will send (http://beta.wowdb.com/quests/42866-a-sign-from-the-sky) you to Khadgar to tell him about something falling from the sky. He sends you to investigate (http://beta.wowdb.com/quests/44257-a-falling-star) the Mysterious Lightbound Object (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/140574-mysterious-lightbound-object) in Suramar. <br />
<br />
We then learn a little bit about Turalyon's fate (http://beta.wowdb.com/quests/44004-bringer-of-the-light) and Khadgar sends you to the Exodar to seek out Prophet Velen. The video below picks up here and ends with Light's Charge (http://beta.wowdb.com/quests/44153-lights-charge).<br />

Warcraft Movie - Box Office Update<br />
The Warcraft Movie continues to do well internationally, with Deadline posting (http://deadline.com/2016/06/warcraft-conjuring-2-x-men-apocalypse-ninja-turtles-jungle-book-international-box-office-weekend-results-1201771160/) updated numbers:<br />
<br />
<br />
Warcraft is up to $156M in China, setting a new record for an opening weekend. <br />
It also set the record for fastest to 1B rmb, beating the old record holder, Furious 7. <br />
Warcraft also set a new record for IMAX showings, making $20M and passing the old $17M record held by Ultron.<br />
The international total is $261M and domestic is $24M, for a total of $286M so far.<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
re: Broken Shores skip: Will it apply cross-faction or will we have to complete it once for each faction?<br />
It is cross-faction. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/740968506045272064))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Was it so bad that raiding was for raiders, pvp was for pvpers and the world was for the masses?<br />
IMHO, no. However, we failed to deliver the world for the masses part much past vanilla. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/734896310701150208))<br />

Build of the Month - June 2016<br />
Each month or so we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
Important: The GTX 1080 ($700) (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FWI7J7G?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20) and GTX 1070 ($450) are here. Unfortunately stock is very limited, resulting in expensive cards if you can find them. New cards from AMD are also on the way. Nicer versions of the 1080 and 1070 are also coming soon, with a lower price and better coolers. If you aren't in a hurry, it is worth waiting for price drops and new cards. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/june/nvidiaBenchmarks.png?v2 (https://www.techpowerup.com/reviews/NVIDIA/GeForce_GTX_1070/21.html) <br />
<br />
The current SSD prices (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/june/ssdgraph.gif) are fairly flat right now, with most SSDs under $0.50 per gigabyte when on sale.<br />
<br />
Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D15 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L7UZMAK?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00L7UZMAK). <br />
<br />
Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or streaming, you do not need the 6700K and should spend that money elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date.<br />
<br />

Yeah that bit me hard in America once. Saw something in the shop I wanted, didn't have my money on me. Walked to my folks to borrow exact change to buy it, walked back to the shop and then was like WTF when the cashier quoted a higher price. Had to put the item back on the shelf.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guardian_titan</div><div class="date">2016-06-13, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With US prices, only reason I can think of that they don't include tax in the price is because each place has a different tax rate. Where I live, the tax rate is 0.074% but if I drive to the town north of me, the tax rate is a little higher. I go somewhere else and it might be a little lower. Even going from the city to the county can result in a tax rate change. It'd be one thing if the tax rate was universal even if it was just state wide universal, but when every town and even county has a different tax rate, it gets a little frustrating.<br />
<br />
Guess Americans are more focused on the base price of an item and if that's different between customers they complain, but we completely ignore tax which can result in a few cents up to a hundreds of dollars of difference. If tax were included in the price, I can see a LOT more people throwing a hissy fit because someone else got quoted $19.57 for an item but they got quoted $23.38 for the same item thanks to tax differences.<br />
<br />
Also doesn't help that tax isn't always charged for online shopping. That often depends on state laws.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd like it if tax were included in the price myself, but it is what it is. If it makes sense, they're not likely to do it.<br />

On WoW, I saw the Turalyon quest line previously although didn't really read much outside of the Velen part. I can't help but wonder if Blizzard's putting too much into Legion because something's going to get the short end of the stick. They always short change stories by the end of the expansion. Look at Grommash and Yrel in WoD. Others they may eventually come back to but I can't help but feel they just ran out of ideas for what to do so went back to a story they left unfinished or half baked (such as Illidan).</div></div><hr />

I get the reasoning behind the 970 to 1080, although I would recommend the 1070 and not the 1080 - the 10XX cards are night and day compared to anything else. Much higher performance per dollar than the 1080 and still wipes the floor with anything not called a 1080. But I agree with you on the 6600 vs 6700 @ less than $100 difference.</div></div><hr />

Right, I'm not contesting the 10 series cards. They are HUGE for performance. It just baffles me to be advocating these new shiny (and expensive) cards, and in the same breath insisting on a nearly 1/3rd lower performance i5 instead of an i7 for less than $100 savings...</div></div><hr />

Yup. States have sales tax and they all differ. For example right now Florida is at 6% and Minnesota is at 6.875%. But now if you buy cloths in one of the 8 participating states you pay no sales tax. /boggle.</div></div><hr />

It has the same number of cores, it just has hyperthreading. Hyperthreading isn't useful for most games, resulting in the same or lower performance in many cases. WoW is one of those cases.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep, sales tax can have contributing factors at the city, county, and obvs state level. In some states there is no sales tax (because their property taxes are ridonkulously high). In some states there is tax on almost everything. <br />
<br />
In MN you don't pay sales tax on categories of items considered &quot;essential&quot; to life: clothes, shoes, medicinal drugs, and food. However, there are exceptions! T-shirts have no tax, for example, but fur clothing does. Milk or bread has no sales tax. Pepsi and Snickers bars do (because candy, soft drinks, dietary supplements and prepared food are taxable). Are you in Minneapolis? Lucky you - they're pretty much perpetually paying for sports stadiums (for teams that are absolute crap). Extra tax for you that other cities don't have. Are you in Hennepin county but outside of Minneapolis? Lucky you, you still get stuck with the Transit Improvement (light rail) tax that other counties don't have!<br />
<br />
If prices were after-tax, you would have to update them on a very labor-intensive basis. The store in Minneapolis would have different price for a pack of Pepsi than the same store in St. Paul. And maybe it would change every single year. You would have to be changing these prices per-store, per-county, per-city, for literally hundreds of thousands of items.<br />
<br />
Or you can just use the calculator on your phone (or basic math skills).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't see how having many zones to choose from to level at any time would make people choose less preffered zones. All would stack on the easiest, fastest ones and some would get totally neglected(and deserted) as there would be too many to choose from. <br />
<br />
Maybe zone-level scalling can work in an expansion but it would ruin base of Wow - feeling like a mighty hero, feeling of achievement. <br />
<br />
I am usually supporting Blizzard in their new ideas, I even like pet battles, didn't mind garrissons, had no problem with one underwater zone (that was pretty optional) but they move more and more to the point where Wow will be totally unatractive to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Higher base clock (+0.5 GHz is nothing to scoff at) and more cache for the i7 will make it faster usually.<br />
Also, I am pretty sure i7's are better in WoW than i5's from the same generation.<br />
If you have the budget, there is little to no reason not to splurge on i7.</div></div><hr />

I think if they did it right, it would work fine ... don't have them scale infinitely, but scale in a range ... like for Example Northern Barrens could scale from 10 to 20 instead of having a range of quests from 10 to 20 like it does not. So even if you go in at 14 you're still able to start at the beginning and work your way through it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ya, you're right, it's virtualized cores. However, there are VERY few situations in which hyperthreaded cores are less efficient than half that cores non-hyperthreaded, and most of those situations involve using all of those cores at 100% capacity with little or no IO. WoW ain't that.</div></div><hr />

Also just to put this in perspective for you fanboys that try and twist everything. Fantastic Four, the biggest flop/bomb in the last year made more than Warcraft. Fantastic Four did 26 million opening weekend and everyone laughed. It also only cost 120 million to make. You won't be getting a sequel.</div></div><hr />

Thanks, Captain Obvious. -_-<br />
At least he realized what mistakes were made. Beats WoD dev team that messed up everything they could mess up and everything we thought was impossible to mess up.</div></div><hr />

Sure, but what prevented him from realizing it before? -_-<br />
That is the 5-million subscriber question.</div></div><hr />
