Patch 5.4 Developer Interviews<br />
Horde for Life (http://hordeforlife.com/2013/08/21/horde-for-life-special-developer-episode-marco-koegler/) had the chance to interview Marco Koegler (Technical Director) recently. You can find information from previous interviews on our Patch 5.4 Developer Interviews page (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1345).<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/august/devInterviews.jpg (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1345) <br />
<br />
Technical Aspects<br />
<br />
Developing WoW with countries that have poor network connectivity in mind is part of the reason why you can play WoW relatively well on a poorer connection. <br />
Making the game feel like you are playing locally by compensating for latency on the client and server end has always been an important part of development.<br />
Fixes that took days in the past now take a matter of hours thanks to the advancement in how patching is done. <br />
Whenever new features are added, people on older hardware are kept in mind to make sure the game is playable for them still. It is a painful process to maintain that kind of compatibility, but Blizzard doesn't want people to be unable to play the game due to new features.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gameplay<br />
<br />
The BMAH has been successful at giving players that are focused on earning gold items to purchase, such as mounts, pets, transmog sets, and other things. It was also useful in phasing in access to the Brawler's Guild. There aren't any changes to the BMAH planned. It isn't decided yet if new locations will be added outside of Pandaria in the future. <br />
CCP allows players to run somewhat more freely with the economy, but Blizzard is interested in making sure that no one has a severe impact on other players. <br />
<br />
<br />
Experiments and the Economy<br />
<br />
The Guardian Cub was an experiment in allowing people to sell an item purchased with real currency for gold. If it would have been hugely popular, we might have seen more things like it. Playing with an established economy is dangerous though, so the devs are careful not to do anything major.<br />
There are currently no plans to directly sell gold to players. It wouldn't be popular with players or good for the game.<br />
The new items added to the in game store in Patch 5.4 are really only targeted at Asia as time saving conveniences. Blizzard definitely doesn't want to venture into the pay to win territory or change the current business model. It is an experiment, similar to the Guardian Cub.<br />
<br />
<br />
Previous Expansions<br />
<br />
At one point in developing the water effects for Cataclysm the oceans were 3D, moving up and down and side to side, but it looked odd with characters swimming in it. Having the waves move players or making them less visible under waves didn't work out well, so the team went with a 2D water surface with a ripple effect. <br />
Vashj'ir made it difficult to place spells in a 3D environment. There was also an underwater wave effect that gave some people motion sickness, which was addressed by making the effect less pronounced in the center of the screen.<br />
<br />

Patch 5.4 PTR Patch Notes Update - August 20<br />
General<br />
Battlefield: Barrens<br />
<br />
Vol’jin and his forces move beyond gathering supplies and into a full assault on the Horde capital. As such, the Battlefield: Barrens weekly quest will no longer be available once the invasion on Orgrimmar begins in 5.4.<br />

Latent Kor'kron armor tokens will no longer drop or be available for purchase. Players who still have a Radical Mojo will continue to be able to combine it with existing Latent Kor'kron armor tokens.<br />

Raid Testing Schedule - August 21<br />
On Wednesday , August 21, we will continue testing raid encounters in the Siege of Orgrimmar raid. <br />
<br />
Each encounter should be available at approximately the listed times below for all Public Test Realms.<br />
<br />
Wednesday , August 21<br />
<br />
Norushen - 25 Player Normal - 10:30 PDT (13:30 EDT, 19:30 CEST)<br />
Thok the Bloodthirsty- 25 Player Normal - 13:30 PDT (16:30 EDT, 22:30 CEST)<br />
Garrosh Hellscream - 25 Player Normal - 16:00 PDT (19:00 EDT, 01:00 CEST)<br />
<br />
<br />
As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a beta environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the boss being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br />

Change to RPPM Mechanics<br />
As an update to this, as part of our continued balancing, we're going to increase the &quot;time since last proc&quot; reset on boss pulls to 120 seconds. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/265372-change-to-rppm-mechanics/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/9573547577?page=20#386))<br />
<br />
Experience Increase Potions<br />
Hold your horses. The in-game store items (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/103557-enduring-elixir-of-wisdom) that you mentioned may be popular in Asia, but we have to see what pans out here in Europe and the US. They may not make it into the game at all if we don't feel it's the right thing to do.

Blue Tweets<br />
IMO sets that become classics are ones that embody a class in some way. T16 has coherent theme accross all sets, but doesn't -<br />
I see what you're saying, but polls of best sets always skew towards early ones, which makes me think nostalgia plays a big role. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366721209469124609))<br />
<br />
Please rethink this RPPM change. Fun trinkets like UVLS are now having stupid low uptimes. Better yet, go to back to ICD.<br />
ICD trinkets just feel passive. Every 10 sec, you get 1000 stats like clockwork. With RPPM we wanted to recapture fun double procs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363743676108783617))<br />
<br />
quick q: do you guys nerf drop rates anywhere near as often as people think you do without telling us in patch notes?<br />
No. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366010430650458112))<br />
<br />
the expansion is coming to an end and for the first time in the last 3 I don't have all classes at level cap. Alts != fun atm.<br />
Many players got so many maxed out alts during the final patch in ICC and DS. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364605191573614594))<br />
mostly the gear hump once you ding 90. Takes so much maintenance to be current. Wish valor ot Ancients stacked<br />
If you go Flex or Heroic Scenarios, there is no ilevel. If you want higher ilevel for that or other content try Timeless Isle (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364880183313960961))<br />
Hscenario takes ilvl I'm almost sure. <br />
In 5.3. Not in 5.4. We concluded that premade content generally doesn't need those requirements, (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364956775033745412))<br />
You seem to miss that many heroic scenario groups are being built using the trade chat. It's infact not premade<br />
Premade is premade. If you invite even a stranger you have a chance to vet or kick them. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365274035350798336))<br />
<br />
will the item upgrade NPC stay with the release of 5.4?<br />
That is what we are thinking at the moment. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364604161167339520))<br />
<br />
So, will I be able to send heirlooms to a connected realm?<br />
The goal of connected realms is to give you folks to play with, not to give you more alts. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364601138647007232))<br />
I'm not saying it won't happen, but just keep the goal in mind -- that's our priority. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364601221220278273))<br />
<br />
Also did you play pre-reforge version of WOW? believe me no one wants it back reforge became core of wow's end game style.<br />
Can you explain why? Nobody is making interesting decisions, except possibly healers. Everyone else follows a website or calculator. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366707503725150209))<br />
Reforging is good because it means the gap between BiS and everything else is smaller. &quot;Interesting&quot; isn't relevant.<br />
Interesting decisions are much more important to the developers than the gap between BiS and not BiS. YMMV. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367368021615968257))<br />
the only real gap exists between &quot;interesting for developers&quot; and &quot;interesting for players&quot;.<br />
They are sometimes at odds since the player mindset is typically to remove obstacles and the developers' is to add them. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367373215040933888))<br />
It may be counter intuitive, but obstacles are fun. Curving tracks with hills and koopas &gt; straight drag strips. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367373652838215680))<br />
<br />
For hardcore raiders, having highly geared &quot;Alts&quot; is needed.<br />
That's a choice very competitive guilds make. I don't see why we'd need to make alts easier to level and gear just for them. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366708514263011328))<br />
<br />
Then stop adding flavor items that players can't collect. Do you expect people to farm for items then trash them?<br />
Inventory space is a resource. It has been since vanilla. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366707307318493184))<br />
<br />
And that's different from the current legendaries how? You created the sense of entitlement by making them readily available<br />
The cloaks are just a different cat entirely. Nearly everyone can get them. The original question was class-specific weapons. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366705752607424512))<br />
In some ways, we thought glaives worked better than daggers, when rogues could sort of know the date they would be completed. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366705886359584768))<br />

Seriously? You are blizzard. You have vast resources. A developer answering a question with &quot;makes me think&quot;. No, Greg Street.

No wonder a lot of people dislike GC - he is shoving his nose to places where it doesn't belong. Your answer accomplished nothing. <br />
<br />
You have a vast Marketing department. Do your research. Do your research in consumer psychology. Either give us a precise answer or don't. Simple. The community are entitled of opinions, heck, even Indie companies are. A company of your size doesn't. Sorry to all the people for the rant. Maybe I am just being ignorant, and focusing on Blizzards flaws, and ignoring all the good things but stuff like this just makes me mad. How can you expect good gameplay, balance and etc. when you feel the company is not being run how it should be. Heck, if I was overseeing, I would call for disciplinary action.

Is this a easier way of saying...<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll let you buy gold with real money, but you will have to spend a lot more real cash to get X amount of in-game gold. Rather than us selling it to you for a fixed price and at a cheaper and more reliable rate of equivalent exchange.&quot;<br />

Whenever new features are added, people on older hardware are kept in mind to make sure the game is playable for them still. It is a painful process to maintain that kind of compatibility, but Blizzard doesn't want people to be unable to play the game due to new features.<br />
Can Blizzard kick the can and tell people with 14 year old computers to go into a Tiger Direct's store and buy their dirt cheapest computer for $350 and run WoW at medium settings?<br />
<br />
I really can't find pity for these people, I have friends who bitch about how lame their singular family computer is. Yet their family have the time to find 3 cruise line trips every year and still bitch about their allowance not being high enough. The last time I went on a vacation? A couple of weeks ago to Colorado and we had to drive all the way their from Florida (Almost 3000 miles, 2.5 days driving).<br />
The last vacation before that? Uhh... maybe 12 years driving to Maine when I was a little kid for the snow?<br />
-----------------------------------<br />
<br />
The new items added to the in game store in Patch 5.4 are really only targeted at Asia as time saving conveniences. Blizzard definitely doesn't want to venture into the pay to win territory or change the current business model. It is an experiment, similar to the Guardian Cub.<br />
Hmm... let's think of possible P2W items in a hypothetical store shall we...<br />
<br />
(1) OP Gauntlet - Gives 60,000+ all stats and 2000% crit with a 90% crit chance. Costs $200.<br />
(2) OP Mount - Can be used in PvE, PvP, Competitive PvP. Instant Cast. +600% Movement Speed, Attacks/Spells can be used while mounted. Costs $250.<br />
(3) OP Rebirth - Return to life every 15 seconds, can be used anywhere at any time. Costs $400.<br />
<br />
Now let's go down to some &quot;Non P2W Items&quot;<br />
(1) XP Elixir - Same as it currently is.<br />
(2) Portable Bank - Give yourself a portable bank to use for 15 minutes that can be shared in your party.<br />
(3) Portable Mailbox - Give yourself a portable mailbox to use for 15 minutes that can be shared in your party.<br />
(4) Honor Elixir - Increase Honor gain by 50% to a maximum of 2000 Honor for 1 hour.<br />
(5) Gathering Non-Distract - When Mining/Plucking Flowers/Skinning, you will not be interrupted if attacked.<br />
(6) XP Rest - XP rest will be doubled for 72 hours.<br />
(7) Buy Dance moves for X Race.<br />
(8) Buy Glowing Ring that can be transmogged (Ring has no stats)<br />
<br />
Holy fuck, was that hard to distinguish between P2W items and convenience items? Who here has played LoL, Dota 2, GW2 or any other game with &quot;convenience items&quot;? I'm just baffled to what Blizzard is doing/thinking.<br />
<br />
If anything I bet they are going to go into a Cash Shop with convenience items, but this is their damndest strangest way of introducing it.</div></div><hr />

You have a vast Marketing department. Do your research. Do your research in consumer psychology. Either give us a precise answer or don't. <br />

No. Tier 6 is one of the best looking sets in the game, also the cloaks from BT/MH are the best looking cloaks in the game, there is no nostalgia, They straight out look better.<br />
T6 depends on the class. Warrior, Paladin, Shaman, Priest are all downright iconic examples of tier design done right. Mage and Hunter T6 are two of the worst sets any class has ever gotten, Hunter T6 being the absolute worst. I can't believe when I see people walking around in that.<br />
<br />
Disagree on cloaks too. Cloaks in general improve every expansion. Only a few good ones from TBC, and most of those are repeats from vanilla.<br />
<br />
<br />
I feel like the visual quality of priest gear has been just horrible this entire expansion, both pve and pvp. What gives with that? Cata priest gear wasn't this bad, and priest's ulduar gear was amazing. This is very lackluster stuff<br />
Granted T14 and T15 were blah, but S12 and S13 were good and T16 and S14 are good as well. T16 doesn't look good in green, but that's hardly a negative as most things don't. If you were just going by PVE I would say it hasn't been great for priest sets, but taking both PVE and PVP into consideration I'd say it has been pretty solid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The thing about nostalgia is that you are remembering what you thought you experienced in the past but its always the just good parts. You dont need to be nostalgic to judge which sets look better, you can line them all up right now and see which ones are better and its pretty much all TBC or earlier. I might consider only one set for Cata to be useable for any class I play(8 of them) and would only choose a MoP set over an earlier set for my monk which has no choice really(IRT tier sets).<br />
<br />
Although I do have to say that some of the sets I thought were ugly in Wrath dont look too bad now when placed next to Cata and some MoP sets.</div></div><hr />

DS tier is still one of my favorites, even though it was not too &quot;priesty&quot;<br />
<br />
How is reforging an interesting decision for healers? All you do is reforge everything you can to your most OP stat.<br />
Disco priest reforging has been interesting this tier so far, with mastery and crit being almost on par you could decide to either go atonement or shield heavy, with spirit being useless in one case and not in the other. I decided to change my reforge going from normal progression to heroic just it suited better our healing comp.<br />
I can see being completely different for DDs, they go one stat deep depending on the current theorycrafting.... DPS is science and healing is art, you know :)</div></div><hr />

Well the older sets were more class-based while now are tier-themed, as the guy said on tweet. Look at this one, it's actually pretty hard to say if it's a paladin, a priest or a mage... take a look on the old T6 for example, you could see a paladin or a priest coming from miles away, and there was no way to confuse them.</div></div><hr />

I don't know man, I think those armory speak to the classes because you saw those classes wearing the armor. I tink the priest gear could easily be Mage or warlock gear. My main is a Shaman and I decided to look at some old tier sets to see if I wanted to xmog in to any of them. I decided I would jut try to finish normal tier 15. I'm a troll, and it looks kind of voodoo-y with the mask and shoulders and it has neat fiery effects (the normal version). When I look at it I see shaman but maybe that's because that's what I've gotten used to seeing a shaman in.</div></div><hr />

It's a PITA, yet another &quot;step&quot; before you can wear the gear you just got. The fact that its pretty expensive isn't helping - I'm sure everyone has /facepalm after getting one upgrade then have reforge lite inform you you got to reforge 90% of your gear.</div></div><hr />

The reason they don't think it would be popular is because they're basing it off their retarded prices for the transmog helms.

And there is nothing wrong with that. The great thing about all these options is that they are subjective and it's your choice. I just think its a little ridiculous when people say &quot;No one likes the new sets. The old sets are way better. Nostalgia? Ridiculous!&quot; I think people should be honest with themselves when determining where their emotional response is coming from. Is it actually aesthetics or is it other influences.<br />
<br />
To note, I think nostalgia is a totally acceptable reason to transmogrify a set and I will like hold on to my tier 15 stuff for ever because, sentimentally, it was my first normal mode, current raid content downed. That's pretty cool to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did GC really expect everyone to sit there and do all the math themselves to decide how to best hit the CAPS by reforging? The devs sometimes astound me with their total lack of foresight. I always thought that reforging was a way to reduce the number of armor peices that they had to make, in that a peice wouldn't be completely useless to some particular class.<br />
<br />
And the hatred for Alts ... man. What is with the hate for ALTS? IMO Valor of the ancients should stack and JP/VP gear should all be bind on account. It should get easier with the more you have. But then ... I like ALTS, they keep me from getting bored.</div></div><hr />

Throw 10 nerfs in ptr, make community go crazy, remove 4 nerfs before live and voila, community nerfed but happy. <br />
I am not the first to see this attitude towards community in wow, many have seen it and wrote about it in the last 4-5 years<br />
<br />
As I said, you are probably over think it.<br />
<br />
They are just probably nerfing and buffing as they see fit. There is no &quot;strategy&quot;. <br />
<br />
And when did Blizzard ever give a rat's ass about whether the &quot;community&quot; is happy? Your whining on the forums have next to zero effect on Blizzard FYI. However if you can produce a good arguement with proper data backing said argument, then yes, you have a chance of effecting change. Otherwise, you are just wasting bandwidth as Blizzard isn't going to put the design of the game up to a vote.<br />

Look at all the bitching about CRZ ... it's still here. LOL.</div></div><hr />

I am not keen on the T16, okay I can live with the shoulders (although lifting my arms to heal with those shoulder...don't know about that), the helm no way (bird beak), and I'm fed up with the robes they keep giving us (ugly). I think priest should look elegant - ethereal - spiritual. Remember the days when walking around Ironforge in full Tier 1 meant you were something? Tier 2 was a really &quot;wow look at that priest&quot; (I kept all my Tier 2, I worked so hard to get it all way back when). I liked my Tier 5 and Tier 6 also. No comment on cloaks, I generally just hide mine, hide the helm also unless it is really a look I'm going for that day. Ah well- I could transmog - <br />
<br />
I do miss the days when you could tell a class from a distance just by their gear - well unless it was a certain rogue I knew who dressed to look like a priest and would join 5 mans as healer and see if anybody noticed(Vanilla). He was great at bandaging :)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Metacrias</div><div class="date">2013-08-21, 08:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that developers need to take a more serious look at ways to allow dedicated, tested players do harder material without premade groups (allowing random flex raids, heroic scenarios, etc). My issue is my schedule: I play WoW A LOT, but I teach a course at my University (I'm a PhD Cand.), work a second night-job, and generally have a sporadic, ever-changing schedule. Most guilds won't keep me on as a raider because I can't commit to specific times and nights weeks in advance or with guaranteed regularity. Yet lfr is too easy, heroic scenarios can't be done randomly, the gear I can get on my own isn't optimal... I want more challenge, but my schedule (and many other players' schedules) doesn't allow me to plan what nights I'll be available for what more than a few days in advance - all I've got is lfr now and it's frustrating. <br />
<br />
Why not implement random flex-raids (with their higher ilvl rewards) and random heroic scenarios, but do so in a way that ensure that more serious players are going to be the vast majority choosing to do them. Perhaps require they run a particular lfr or random heroic once normally before allowing access to doing that one with a random group? Perhaps have certain higher ilvls required to run'em? Maybe have a set of one-time 'tests' for a toon to 'qualify' for access to special, high-difficulty randoms?<br />
<br />
It would be great to have a set of individual scenario/challenges to qualify to be allowed to run random flexes, random heroic scenarios and RANDOM CHALLENGE MODES for regular dungeons. I, and many other players in similar situations, would love to access this content but am limited by an unpredictable schedule from being able to do so easily and regularly by the current means of accessing this content. Guilds don't want members for regular raids, challenge mode dungeons, heroic scenarios who can't guarantee regular availability on a set time schedule, current random content is too easy... Allow randoms for challenge mode, flex raids and heroic scenarios but find some means of ensuring that those who can access them are serious about it (more exclusive, but available to everyone so long as they commit to improving their play individually and in a way that does not necessitate guild membership or premade groups).</div></div><hr />

Damn, Blizzard developers are really stupid. I thought they mostly implemented the feature to a) give players another way to &quot;personalize&quot; and decide over their characters, and b) another gold dump mechanic.</div></div><hr />
