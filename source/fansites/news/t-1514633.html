Connected Realms Update 5/08<br />
Both US and EU realm connections (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/292512-connected-realms-update-02-04/#post1648) appear to be officially on hold now. <br />
*Please note that further realm connections are on hold pending further back end work. We don't have an ETA on when these will resume, but we'll update this thread and the blog post once connections resume.<br />

IMO only cast times and nearly nothing else is just as bad as spam-instants. Neither make interesting situations.<br />
Well, philospohically, all-cast-times would be better than all-instants. However, we're at neither of those extremes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458325358488469504))<br />

Any changes to death knight presences? They are pretty much just passive aura buttons and do nothing to gameplay.<br />
They're exclusive passive bonuses. Some gameplay, though not a lot. But doesn't need to be a lot. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458701760693932032))<br />

Why was tranq made resto only? Some of my favorite moments through the years were clutch tranq saves as a feral<br />
Because we're reducing stackable raid utility like that. Want to return raid survival to being the healers' job. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458702924974022656))<br />
But yet Mage raid CD is stackable with any throughput healer CD, how do you not see that as a potential issue?<br />
Errr... That's the point? Perhaps a misunderstanding of the goal? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458711466657329152))<br />

http://t.co/gw9GjjjVjl This thread basically sums up most thoughts on KS. The second charge is terrible and unreliable.<br />
Kill Shot will take less than 1/3 as long, including latency, to reset, in Warlords. We expect that will solve it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458790346030202880))<br />

how is the pandemic effect on dots going to effect Living Bomb explosion?<br />
Just like it works today, except with a 3.6sec overlap time, instead of [3/Haste]sec. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458306722596016128))<br />
Would this lead to situation where you always want to refresh LB at that point throughout a fight to get more explosions?<br />
No... That's the point. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458309958769983488))<br />
<br />
You said there are too many raid cooldowns and now you make a new one for mages. Why?<br />
Because we want to reduce them overall, but also balance them better. That means giving a small one to specs that have none. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/457974663818137600))<br />
6 raid cds at 100% effectiveness vs. 12 raid cds at 50% seems like no change besides more logistical headaches.<br />
Yes, but how about against 8 raid CDs at 50%? That's more accurately comparable to what we're doing. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458447290592546816))<br />
Why not just give them to healers/tanks? That way nobody stacks certain DPSers due to raid CDs?<br />
A fair question. The answer is that we don't feel it's reasonable to completely remove them all. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458451218616954881))<br />
Do we cut Safeguard? Stampeding Roar? Demonic Portal? Sacred Shield? How many new talents would we have to create to fill holes? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458451696390131712))<br />

Are you taking away the snare from Fists of Fury for Windwalkers?<br />
You mean the stun? Nope. You can glyph it to trade the stun for the ability to move during it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/457682636052258816))<br />
<br />
Can all eminence healing be tied to statue?<br />
No, you don't want that. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458073948748406784))<br />
Also, can the cd be removed from statue? Is there any -real- reason it has a cd to begin with?<br />
Well, it's so that you care about the position you choose, and don't feel like you're expected to constantly move it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458074463825711104))<br />
However, a decent argument could be made that 30sec is more restrictive than is needed for that purpose. We'll discuss it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458074624366874624))<br />
Removing the global would be a step, 30 seconds would be fine if it didn't cost a global.<br />
No, that'd be terrible. Not being on the global would imply that you are absolutely supposed to min/max its placement on every CD. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458075314459918336))<br />
<br />
Or just like... make the statue do something else. It's pretty boring.<br />
Soothing Mist and Eminence; one thing per stance. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458074061801680897))<br />

seems we could ignore the current twisting talent as prot will only have two seals.<br />
Prot will indeed likely not use Seal of Insight much, without Empowered Seals. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458323249537884160))<br />
confused; if insight doesn't give prot haste or heal procs what would it do?<br />
Increased healing done. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458323876972228608))<br />
<br />
Warriors getting defensive benefits from crit; Paladins nothing? Insight loosing 10% haste, Righteous still to little dmg to use<br />
Yeah, this is all confusion. A) There's no more spell haste, just full haste. B) Holy Shield is likely undertuned; haven't tuned... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458311634662862848))<br />
...yet. C) Paladins get the exact same defensive benefit from Crit that Warriors do. D) Spell Haste from Insight didn't benefit... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458311963240431616))<br />
...you as Prot anyway. E) Righteousness will be worth using in the next build. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458312305663418368))<br />
thank you for responses. How did insight haste not help EF ticks? Seems like we have no good tanking seal now?<br />
We're moving the heal-on-hit proc from Seal of Insight to a Prot passive. We'll expect Prot and Ret to use Truth and Rightousness. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458319161442050048))<br />
On that topic, what sort of gameplay can we expect from Paladin seals in general? (for all specs)<br />
Ret/Prot will swap Seals more than Holy will. Seal of Righteousness will convert Crusader Strike into Hammer of the Righteousness (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458323127643021312))<br />
Curious. Wonder if Righteous will apply the Truth DoT now? That would be a welcome addition!<br />
No, it won't. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458328947873165312))<br />
<br />
concerning emp seals, any chance you guys are taking seals off of gcd and they share their own? Would feel clunky otherwise<br />
While it's an option, continue down that line of thinking. Where does it lead? What happens to your rotation? What buttons are used? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458823779850788864))<br />

.I assume a POM from the SAME priest will overwrite, and POM has 'weird' bouncing rules... some protection might be warranted<br />
I don't believe there's anything to protect it from bouncing to a target that already has your PoM (overwriting), but it goes to... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/459017988071358465))<br />

well there wouldn't be anything now, you can't have more than 1 out. I would assume you could have more than 1 out with WOMPOM<br />
We're actually trying letting you have more than one out, anyway. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/459021017449373696))<br />
<br />
Since casting POM on a DI proc, could both be your final WOMPOM stack.... and both overwrite/cancel at the same time. No?<br />
OK, we're going to try making it not bounce to targets you already have a PoM on. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/459023766723387392))<br />

Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/457974059343429632))<br />

any hope that earthquake could be shorter cast time or instant? Very frustrating to use no matter how much damage it does vs CL<br />
No; cast time spells are good for gameplay. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458324091334705153))<br />

I was wondering if SB: Haunt would consume 2 soulshards to use. That's what started this Twitter bomb.<br />
Yes. Soulburn costs a shard, then Haunt costs a shard. You get the Buff and the DD/Debuff. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458073785476730881))<br />

Art<br />
So how about hiding shoulders, then? Diff topic!<br />
No current plans, but I can definitely see the appeal, especially for various cloth transmog looks. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/457679980013449216))<br />
<br />
Can we have new spell visual for melee (Rogue/War) that are concerned? SS/Ambush/RvS have the same visual to not mention others.<br />
Yeah, melee abilities tend to rely on animation more than visual effects, but we can definitely do more to make them feel epic. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/459010507622469632))<br />
<br />
Character / Items<br />
have you guys thought about set bonuses for making gear be best for PVE or PVP?<br />
Past set bonuses made an effort to do that. It was never enough. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/459108865611558914))<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor Stats<br />
Yea, it's a bit odd for tanks too. Stack Readiness to get another shield wall for a boss special or why get any?<br />
Luckily, it affects more than just 3min cooldowns. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458365064764854272))<br />
<br />
Gladstance going to disable Bonus Armor on gear? also does the armor factor into ilvl? I.E. Armor item on fury = less crit stat?<br />
Bonus Armor will actually provide DPS value for tanks. Yes, it's part of the item's budget. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458378387044564992))<br />
any tidbits about how? Thorns? Armored to the teeth? some new fangled quirky thing?<br />
A passive, Bladed Armor. Increases Attack Power by 100% of your Bonus Armor. (NOTE: Just *Bonus* Armor, not ALL Armor) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/458387044905938945))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
Will reincarnation consume a combat ress charge?<br />
No, just like with today's system, Reincarnation is a personal benefit that is outside the raid-level rules. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/457683115951935488))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
what is your opinion on the reflect meta-gem that is picked by almost 80% of all healer &amp; even some dps classes in arena<br />
It's a bit curious as the chance is small. What are your thoughts about it? (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/458648434975584256))<br />
<br />
if someone is pvp tagged in wod, and i heal them, will my ilevel increase too?<br />
yes (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/458658769627787264))<br />
<br />
Regarding gear having 2 ilvls... If an Ally raid is fighting a World Boss and 1 Horde AoEs them, the raid gets their ilvls buffed?<br />
Yes, people could get into PvP to buff their DPS against world boss. It's a downside we can live with due to the upsides. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/458681432618315776))<br />
I'm just afraid it will be abused by people going for world 1st leveling, since they usually take a friend from another faction...<br />
I really don't think we should not do the right thing for PvP because of a concern about world first leveling. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/458682584244183041))<br />
<br />
Don't you fear that some might exploit the ilvl activation on PvP in PvE (e.g. world bosses) for dps boost to the boss?<br />
It might happen but we're not concerned about it. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/458684862543974401))<br />
<br />
did you say solo queue skirmishes?<br />
I did (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/458682742516244482))<br />
<br />
will there be hidden MMR in WoD skirmishes? please say yes <br />
Yes..but the matchmaking will be more focused on speed (i.e. we'll expand the search faster than say Rated Arenas) (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/458688608988172289))<br />
<br />
can't wait to try out wod! Pvp is looking solid. Only concern is will pve gear still scale down in pvp instance?<br />
only mythic (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/458676971514634240))<br />
my fear would mainly be legendaries, that would not be mythic. Would legendaries scale down in pvp instances too?<br />
The ilevel ceiling will work similar to now. PvP gear will ignore it but Mythic gear (&amp; Legendaries if it applies) will be reduced. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/458683820561010688))<br />
<br />
I am curious about this as well, how can we see/compare the PVP stats when not in PVP?<br />
Hm, I see, so you're saying the ability to see what the stats will be when PvP, not just the ilevel. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/458685517849034752))<br />
We haven't developed final solution for tooltip, but added this to video to illustrate the intent. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/458685617883205632))<br />
Certainly good to get feedback on initial reaction. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/458685711315501056))<br />
<br />
If my HP is 80k/100k; Horde hits me and max HP becomes 120k, does my HP stay at 80k or go to 96k (80%)?<br />
It stays relative so 96k. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/458729906214408192))<br />
<br />
Why does PvE and PvP gear have to be different? Why can't they be the same item just obtained from different means?<br />
Conquest gear needs to at least match the best available raid gear for PvP, but is much more accessible by design. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/459033275629989888))<br />
<br />
we want this a lot but our UI time is heavily constrained so we can't promise it. (Russ Petersen (https://twitter.com/nite_moogle/status/458686334710722560))<br />
Yes, unfortunately a &quot;PvP mode&quot; on the character pane is a big technical challenge. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/458686525979377664))<br />
[i]Also: you'll always be in &quot;PvP mode&quot; on Ashran, where gear vendors are.<br />
And there will be a PvP dummy to put yourself in combat. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/458687515621216257))<br />
But still, gear tooltips can be improved. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/458687574198849536))<br />
<br />
How about everyone can join the PvP Beta realm for better PvP testing? Other content is deactivated so no spoilers.. consider it!<br />
That will be the case. Anyone will be able to join the PvP Beta realm and all non-PvP content will be inaccessible. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/458684289240940544))<br />
Just to clarify, that's anyone in beta. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/458690092765179904))<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
quick question, with glyphs been gained as one levels, is it a waste to have inscription now compared to other professions?<br />
Not at all; it's just a handful of level-up glyphs to ease new players into the system. Most glyphs still come from scribes. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/458352829183172608))<br />

The fact that they still have paid transfers open is just disgusting. How about closing or increasing the cost to high/full realms and making it free to dead realms, or just close it all together?

<br />
Aso, as OneSent and Enan1981 said, Frostfire Ridge looks a lot like Borean Tundra. I also felt like Spires of Arak seemed really bland and uninspired and in no way living up to the awesome artwork that was made for it. While actual gameplay will never look as good as the artwork, I just felt like the color pallet was really shallow and bland, and that the spires looked more like hills and not the intimidating spires that they showed in the artwork. <br />
A bit disappointing so far, but still a long way to go, so they'll probably adress a lot :) Hopefully!</div></div><hr />

Again it's an alpha/beta and there's more work to be done but it really doesn't look that great and I'm almost 100% positive they're not further along in the development cycle at this point compared to MoP. If anything they're way behind where they were with MoP.</div></div><hr />

He was playing the PAX Alpha demo during Pax East at home since he lives near the convention center (if you listen to him talking in the video he also mentions it). I was live in this Twitch stream when he did that. First levelup took 2 hours. If you have no clue, don't act up.</div></div><hr />

In fact, some of our PvP Players are leaving due to CRZ lift with other crowded realms. They say they can't find partners from Elwynn Forest anymore. - So I'm expecting our realm to become ghost town outside Capitals, since nobody actually leaves the Capitals.</div></div><hr />

Why was tranq made resto only? Some of my favorite moments through the years were clutch tranq saves as a feral<br />
Because we're reducing stackable raid utility like that. Want to return raid survival to being the healers' job. (Celestalon)<br />
But yet Mage raid CD is stackable with any throughput healer CD, how do you not see that as a potential issue?<br />
Errr... That's the point? Perhaps a misunderstanding of the goal? (Celestalon)</div></div><hr />

Considering this was recorded back when PAX was going on and he was only able able to login due to a Blizzard screw up and he wanted to get as much content in during his stream/video and on top of that he's just a regular player like us and not a &quot;professional&quot; its fine.

The Frostwolf Orcs are wearing that white leather armour that's been in the game since Classic WoW.. seriously? We have a quest with Thrall and Durotan and they don't even have any voice acted scenes? They're still using the same Orc voice from Classic when you talk to an NPC. <br />
<br />
I know it's an alpha/beta but the zone doesn't look anywhere near finished and it's the only zone we've really seen so far.. also some other people pointed out it looks just like Borean Tundra.. which it does.<br />
<br />
I also really dislike the new Orc model.. it just looks like a bunch of mini Garrosh's running around. Durotan looks like he's 4ft. tall.<br />

This was recorded a month ago and this guy is playing on alpha version thats probably 4-5 months old and even Blizzard stated that they arent inviting more people because they still working on intro experience which includes these first zones.</div></div><hr />

Because that is 437 item level and hasn't been used by most people for almost 2 years ... ?<br />
<br />
Cata greens were 272-320 ilvl <br />
<br />
MoP greens were 372-437<br />
<br />
Or in other words, this isn't a new thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well they will have starter greens and questing gear to help with that. And presumably many people that haven't raided will have timeless or booster gear, or pvp gear well above that. I just wonder if you will be able to go there at 88 or have to be 90.</div></div><hr />

Alright. But there are going to be people who may have a level 85 or 86 toon they want to level. How are they going to make that transition? You only get one boost to 90, then you have to pay cash.<br />
<br />
So I ask again, how is a toon that may have a smattering of MOP greens from various zones and thus ilevels, supposed to do the starter quests in WoD? It does not make sense.</div></div><hr />

I can't say for certain as obviously the expansion isn't out yet, but I imagine it'd be like going from Wrath to Cata that in the first few quests in WoD like cata would probably reward a weapon and a few other pieces at the appropriate ilvl to make the transition easier. Also with the stat squish it is possible the difference in ilvls may not have as massive difference in stats as it is right now. Again, hard to say for certain as Beta and whatnot isn't out yet, but they are possibilities.</div></div><hr />

You get greens early on from questing, its the 5th expansion, trust me, they will balance it out.</div></div><hr />
