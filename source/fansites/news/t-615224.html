Except for the AP its a Caster/Healer Item. But that AP seems odd here. Perhaps this is supposed to be Mail. Would make more sense for shamans and possibly hunters (don't cut my head of if that is wrong. I don't know in what way they profit from spell power)</div></div><hr />

I'm guessing kinda like Mark of Defiance (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=27924)/Conquest (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=27920), but in one Item, restoring Health, Mana, probably Runic Power, and maybe even Energy/Rage when you kill a target (doesn't state explicitly you have to make the killing blow, which is good)<br />

<br />
no way, blue enhancement friendly weapons outside of heroics? i dont have to spec resto/elemental just to get pre-raid gear? no wai!<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually no... With the current build, the best DPS comes with slow MH with WF and fast OH with Flametongue and lavalash in the rotation. I did the test on a simulator : fully buffed (elixir, food, drum, 1 bloodlust every 5 minutes, perfect group makeup) on a fully debuffed boss (10 000 hours simulation) and 2.6/1.4 ; WF/FT is 200 DPS higher than 2.6/2.6 ; WF/WF. The spellpower we now have play a really important role.<br />
<br />
I wanted to try that in the real world on the training dummies : but in this case I had no buffs, no debuffs on the &quot;boss&quot;, no mana regen. I did far less DPS (of course :P) but it was still in favor of 2.6/1.4 WF/FT. But only by a slight margin in this case.<br />
<br />
So get ready to roll on rogue daggers for your off-hand :-)</div></div><hr />

Savage Gladiator gear is blue quality, and doesnt need any rating. IE welfare gear.<br />
Hateful Gladiator gear is epic and requires medium high rating, like the weapons require 1875 or something like that IIRC.<br />
Deadly Gladiator gear is also epic, but these require pretty high PR 2050 for weps, and 2200 for shoulders, stuff like that.<br />
I could be right, I could be wrong, but thats what I got out of the PTR.<br />
Armor models look kinda meh imo.</div></div><hr />

I can't find the source now but I think it was answered in some Q&amp;A session with Blizzard employee (again, i don't remember who it was - I think Kalgan) after these items were announced.

I don't know in what way they profit from spell power)<br />
<br />
<br />
Its supposed to be for Boomkin. The new druid staffs give uber AP and base damage to boomkins for a combo of bashing and booming.</div></div><hr />

Strength is only attack power unless you have a shield. No, we dont need 2 sets of 2-handers for 2 ways of saying exactly the same thing.</div></div><hr />

Its already been posted that they will appear as leather/mail for sub-40 characters that will wear mail/plate. <br />

Some of them have been updated with new models, set bonuses have been added for Naxxramas 10 set. (25 Players set are also using this set but we'll assume that's just a placeholder)<br />
Not a placeholder. T7-25 and T7-10 are intended to be a part of the same set. It's from a blue post or a blizzcast iirc.</div></div><hr />

These will be nice though, props blizz. And as for people complaining about 15k mount prices....really...they need something for people to sink large amounts of gold. Heck there's people now at lvl 70 with 50k gold...<br />
<br />
<br />
On 1 more note, this is for all you grinders getting ready for wrath, if no one has thought about this or whatever. So you want some pvp gear for your characters, well from what I've read and understand you will lose your honor at lvl 71...ok no big deal.<br />
<br />
Farm 100 Marks of each BG, place in bank.<br />
<br />
We'll assume it's something like 5 marks of each for a WCToken, that means with 100 of each BG mark, you'll gain 20,000 honor the moment you hit 80.<br />
<br />
Now do the same thing with some alts....since WCToken's will be able to be transferred....you can now save up your 20k/40k/60k+ honor for your main and get yourself pvped out and ready at 80.</div></div><hr />

If you look at both the 25 and 10 sets, they have diff titles, same set bonuses. Look more closely, and you see that the list of required gear for the bonuses use the BASE of the name, not the 10/25 name differential. The same mechanic is used for the arena pieces Brutal Glad Ornamented works with Merc Glad Ornamented for the set bonus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Deadly and Hateful work the same way as Tier10/25man does. They are the same season, but obtained differently/more expensive/harder, just like the Tier sets. Well atleast i believe so :P If not, it will suck major assgrass and they better be placeholders.<br />
<br />
Still, even though if Deadly and Hateful works as Tier 7.10/25 does, the blue set shouldnt look like the epic one, as the dungeon sets doesnt look like the tier sets either. And hopefully, the PvP set weve seen this far, is the blue set as it actually looks more like starting gear than epic. Just like the dungeon set does now compared to the tier sets, for an example.<br />
<br />
<br />
And to add even more. Christ, Blizzard really suck at recoloring gear. Just look at some of those Tier sets. Really looks like crap. I wouldnt want to be a 25man Paladin or a 10man Warlock to name a few. Its terrible. Heck, most of the sets look like shit actually. There is only on a few that the colors match and look ok at all.</div></div><hr />

Ah, so we have several sets each season now, nice. I didn't know:P<br />

I hope it works like that, though they could have made some smaller changes to the better versions.. perhaps like the old lvl 60 pvp blue and epic.. mostly the same just tweaked a little.</div></div><hr />

doubt it's a place holder, blizzard have been saying since very early in the expansion talk that 10 man and 25 man sets will share bonuses so you can mix and match gear from both instances for set bonuses,<br />
like different season gladiators.<br />
<br />
everything else they said about the T7 ended up being true (t3 reused + different colors for 25 and 10 man)<br />
so i'm sure the shared set bonuses are intended as well.</div></div><hr />

Does Deadly have higher req requirements?<br />
Does Hateful have no req requirements?<br />
