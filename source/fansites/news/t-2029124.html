What is Launching This Week?<br />
Lots of things! The bigger changes are listed in sections below, but there are also smaller things:<br />
<br />
<br />
One more character slot has been added. <br />

Many items have been converted to toys. <br />
Classes that can use Mail and Plate no longer graduate to a higher armor level, they just start with the ability to use their armor type.<br />
All creatures and NPCs can now be tapped by up to 5 other characters.<br />
The Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza has taken a temporary hiatus.<br />
Set bonuses for item sets from expansions prior to Warlords of Draenor have been deactivated, though the text describing their former function still remains.<br />

<br />
Stat, Talent, and Glyph Changes<br />
Major Glyphs are gone and the rules for swapping talents have changed: <br />
<br />
Stats<br />
<br />
Multistrike, Spirit, and Bonus Armor have been removed. <br />
Spell Power has been removed from weapons and converted into Intellect. <br />
<br />
<br />
Talents<br />
<br />
Dual spec is gone! You can swap between all of your specs now. <br />
Changing specs will be free, and change your actions bars and (optionally) transmog. <br />
Changing talents will be free in a city or your Order Hall.<br />
Changing talents out in the field will require a reagent crafted by Inscription. <br />
Group Reagent: Codex of the Clear Mind (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/227562-codex-of-the-clear-mind)<br />
Solo Reagent: Tome of the Clear Mind (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/227561-tome-of-the-clear-mind)<br />
<br />
<br />
Glyphs<br />
<br />
The Glyph UI and Major Glyphs are going away (Charred Glyph (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/42753-charred-glyph)). <br />
Minor Glyphs will be applied directly to spells now and consumed on use. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Class Trials<br />
Legion allows you to try a class before boosting it with a short tutorial and the artifact acquisition quests.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Updated Class Models<br />
Druids received some form updates and Warlocks have new demon models.<br />

<br />
<br />
Transmogrification and Wardrobe Changes<br />
Blizzard has a nice overview of the Wardrobe system here (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/417180-preview-wardrobe-updates/). <br />
<br />
<br />
You can now hide your shoulders!<br />
You can transmog weapon enchants, shirts, and tabards. <br />
You need to visit a Transmogrification NPC to hide your cloak, helm, or shoulders now. <br />
Old quest rewards and items you already have should be automatically added to your wardrobe when the patch is live. <br />
If one color of an appearance comes from multiple items, you just need to collect one of them.<br />
To collect an appearance, you need to be able to equip the item, it must be your primary armor type, and it must be obtainable and equippable by your class. <br />
Don't forget to grab Arsenal: Draenor Challenger's Armaments (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/136854-arsenal-draenor-challengers-armaments) if you are eligible. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
PvP Changes<br />
The PvP system received a large overhaul for Legion, allowing for easier and better balancing. <br />
<br />
<br />
Honor Points and Conquest Points were removed. <br />
Items now cost Mark of Honor (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/137642-mark-of-honor), obtained from Battlegrounds, Arenas, and Skirmishes.<br />
The 5v5 Arena bracket has been retired. &quot;Arena Master (http://beta.wowdb.com/achievements/1174-the-arena-master)&quot; achievement has been converted into a Feat of Strength.<br />
Winning a Battleground with characters below level 110 now awards a Crate of Battlefield Goods (http://beta.wowdb.com/items?filter-search=Crate%20Battlefield%20Goods). Players on the opposing team also have a chance to receive a crate with an increasing chance based on team score at the end of a match. The crate contains a piece of armor appropriate for the character’s level and specialization with a chance for the crate to contain additional rewards such as weapons or relics.<br />
PvP stat templates (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/417264-pvp-stat-templates-and-spell-multipliers-july-15th-2016/) are active.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
UI Changes<br />
Lots of changes are coming to the UI, so we have compiled them in a separate post. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/july/uichanges.jpg (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5841-Legion-UI-Changes) <br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeon and Raid Changes<br />
There are a few changes coming to Hellfire Citadel, but the mounts and heirloom trinkets will be around for a little longer.:<br />
<br />
<br />
Tuning is ongoing (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/416379-feedback-hellfire-citadel/#post139) to ensure that Hellfire Citadel remains slightly easier than it was before the patch. <br />
Many of the trinkets have been nerfed. <br />
Loot from Normal difficulty and higher is part of the new upgrade system, with a chance to be randomly upgraded some multiple of 5 item levels. <br />
You can still obtain the Grove Warden (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/189999-grove-warden), Ironhoof Destroyer (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/171621-ironhoof-destroyer), and Felsteel Annihilator (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/182912-felsteel-annihilator), they change with the expansion launch.<br />
You can still obtain the heirloom trinkets (http://beta.wowdb.com/items?filter-reqlvl-min=100&amp;filter-quality=128&amp;filter-slot=4096) that scale to 110 from Mythic dungeons until the expansion launches.<br />
The ability to start the legendary quest line has been removed, but you can keep working on it if you already are on the quest.<br />
Normalized gold from Legacy raids prior to Warlords of Draenor. Heroic difficulty Cataclysm Raids now award less gold than before, while raids from Mists of Pandaria and Wrath of the Lich King will now award more gold.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gold and Garrison Changes<br />
A few changes are coming to Garrisons in this patch:<br />
<br />
<br />
Some Garrison follower upgrades such as Goredrenched Weaponry (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/114622-goredrenched-weaponry) now sell for significantly less. <br />
Treasure Hunter (http://www.wowdb.com/garrison/abilities/256-treasure-hunter) is replaced by Extreme Scavenger (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/abilities/256-extreme-scavenger)<br />
The especially rewarding missions that reward gold, such as Blood, Gold, and Regret (http://www.wowdb.com/garrison/missions/618-blood-gold-and-regret) are being changed to reward something else, such as Apexis Crystals, Oil, Primal Spirit (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/120945-primal-spirit), or other non-gold rewards.<br />
Felblight (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/127759-felblight) is now sold at the Primal Trader in your garrison for 25 x Primal Spirit (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/120945-primal-spirit).<br />
Big Crate of Salvage (http://www.wowdb.com/items/114120-big-crate-of-salvage) will no longer be rewarded, existing crates will be unaffected. You can still get transmog gear (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743184423?page=3#42).<br />
Large Crate of Salvage (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/140590-large-crate-of-salvage) replaces the old crate. <br />
The number of Pet Charms (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/116415-pet-charm#related:reward-of-quest) rewarded by quests have been halved. <br />
The Garrison Resource cost of many items on the Trader NPC at the Trading Post have been increased. <br />
The amount of Garrison Resources rewarded by the random dungeon quest has been reduced. <br />
The maximum amount of gold that can be held at once has been increased to 9,999,999 gold. Guild bank maximum has also been increased to 9,999,999 gold.<br />
Potion of Luck (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/93351-potion-of-luck) and Greater Potion of Luck (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/76091-greater-potion-of-luck) no longer have an effect.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
Most of the new professions content is coming with the Legion release, but there are a few things coming this week:<br />
&lt;style&gt;.wow-icon-overlay-small { width: 15px;}&lt;/style&gt;<br />
<br />
The UI has been updated. Check out the UI changes post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5841-Legion-UI-Changes) for details.<br />
Tome of Illusions (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/professions/enchanting?filter-expansion=7&amp;filter-search=illusions) have been added to allow you to collect old weapon enchant appearances. <br />
Other Illusions (http://beta.wowdb.com/items?filter-search=Illusion&amp;filter-ilvl-max=1) come from vendors or boss drops.<br />
<br />
<br />

WoWDB Addon Data Collectionwowdbaddons<br />
Quickly populating the database with new additions is done with the help of many players. The more people that contribute data, the more accurate and quickly we can update the database. <br />
<br />
To help out, just click here (curse://enable-wowdb-upload) if you have Curse Client already installed. <br />
<br />
When you are playing the addon will gather data and save it. When you are done playing, Curse Client will see the game close and upload the collected data from the addon. <br />

Updated Addons<br />
Addon authors have been hard at work updating their addons (http://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/expansion/legion) for Patch 7.0.3 and Legion. Now might be a good time to take advantage of the Curse Client (http://www.curse.com/client) to update your addons, and the one click update for Premium users (http://www.curse.com/premium/)! <br />

That alone is enough to piss someone off. There is no need to cancel old set bonues. People worked fairly hard for those things.</div></div><hr />

As usual Blizzard doing stupid shit. Why not just disable them in older raids but allow them in shit like Timewalking? It is kinda the reason we farmed some older sets and kept certain items over the years.</div></div><hr />

They brought the ground from somewhere else and put it in place with a wall? I'm fairly certain that's how people build stuff like this (http://previews.123rf.com/images/appalachianviews/appalachianviews1504/appalachianviews150400135/38535393-Long-exposure-of-a-house-on-a-cliff-and-a-small-cove-at-Table-Rock-Beach-in-Laguna-Beach-California--Stock-Photo.jpg)...

As it should be.. Healers are the ressers, unless you have some gadget to do it for you.</div></div><hr />

Expansion launches were the problem, never the pre expansion patch launches.</div></div><hr />

My personal experience was the opposite actually, I think the only xpac launch I had serious problems with was Cata being flaky. Meanwhile I had lots of trouble both personally and on my server with pre-xpac launches all the way back to BC. I think making the events available immediately had something to do with that, this time with it being slow rolled a bit it should be fine.</div></div><hr />

Seriously though, which set bonuses were people abusing and what content were they abusing them in? I would only use them in timewalking and it's not like that content is hard, so why nerf them everywhere?<br />
<br />
They gave mass res to healers at least, rip hunter FD + mass res.</div></div><hr />

PLEASE put them on a lighter background. The dark on dark of a Charcoal background and dark coloured images such as the Druid forms, and Armour sets, makes it horrible difficult to get a really good idea of what they look like, and is especially hard on the eye.<br />
<br />
Trying to view the various models of the Feral Druid is a perfectly good example. It quite literally is Dark on Dark. More than half of the details cannot be seen.</div></div><hr />
