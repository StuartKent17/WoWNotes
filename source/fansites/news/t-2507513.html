Gotta agree here 100%. Even with layering there are way too many players for the mobs, especially in certain areas like Westfall, Elwynn, Darkshire etc. You can spend hours trying to get 8 whatevers. I have no problem whatsoever with layering and hope it stays. Just group with people if you wanna be on their layer. <br />
<br />
Or, as it is in FFXIV, there are different 'instances' of the same zone. You go to the crystal and click it to choose a different instance. Not sure how they would/could implement this in WoW (classic or retail) but it's a decent way around it.</div></div><hr />

Yeh, even a &quot;dead server&quot; would have more players than Vanilla did. Didn't vanilla's servers only allow 3,000 people?? Wouldn't these &quot;dead servers&quot; be closer to the actual vanilla experience?</div></div><hr />

It should get better over time. The initial onslaught of leveling will abate, and at mid levels on up there are more options. Not so much at under 20.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Realm	Type	Timezone<br />
Arcanite Reaper	PvP	Pacific<br />
Earthfury	PvP	Eastern<br />
Heartseeker	PvP	Eastern<br />
For approximately one day after free character moves to a realm begin, these new realms will be restricted to only those players using a free character move. After one day, any player may create new characters there. This is to allow players using the free character move service a better chance at retaining the name of the character theyâ€™re moving.<br />

I call bs. I've used the Cencus addon and I've tracked a few servers now, and they are all crowded with people. 150 is just bs. check out the data here https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/czkjzr/classic_census_character_data_on_eu_realms/</div></div><hr />

There's an extremely simple way of validating my claim. Go online Anathema at night and run your own scan or do it manually with /who. They're going to have transfers to it sometime tomorrow so it's not going to be as dead but I still would never risk playing there.<br />

Maybe it is as dead as you claim, but there is other faction. Just because one faction is dead, does not mean other faction is dead as well. Besides, all realms end up like that eventually.<br />
<br />
I've just checked both factions on Hydraxian Waterlords, which is lowest populated realm in EU (at 3pm, so middle of day on working day, when most players are offline), alliance showed 2.3k players, horde showed 1.1k players. Not bad for middle of work day, already more than vanilla realm cap.</div></div><hr />

Posts like yours are why I sometimes lose faith in the average person's intelligence. People work during the day. Thursday is typically a working day. Most folk don't get home until some time between 5-6pm. and many need to eat first. A lot of people booked time off work last week to play, so it was a lot busier.<br />
<br />
It is now 18:40pm and 9 are full, 8 are high, 3 are medium and only 1 is low because it's a new realm called Judgement.<br />
<br />
It's a huge stretch to surmise that classic is dying simply because people have lives and they're at work instead of playing the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well I'm not in the EU so I was basing it on the US. I think weekday nights are less busier for sure, but weekends still have a queue. But yeh.. for work I don't get home till 6:30-7PM and that's without eating dinner. Then I watch an episode or two depending on the day of the week they air on and then I log in and play a couple hours.</div></div><hr />
