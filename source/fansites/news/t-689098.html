Q. If damage and healing is too much per health ratio, then why don't you have battlegrounds/arenas give a -30% damage/healing debuff? 
A. We have been talking about solutions like that. It might feel a bit awkward, but it might also solve the problem and maybe it's okay in the last season before an expansion to experiment a little bit.  
 
Q. Is there talk of a fire shield spell for elemental shaman to use like water shield for restoration shaman?

<br />
Q. If damage and healing is too much per health ratio, then why don't you have battlegrounds/arenas give a -30% damage/healing debuff?<br />
A. We have been talking about solutions like that. It might feel a bit awkward, but it might also solve the problem and maybe it's okay in the last season before an expansion to experiment a little bit. <br />
<br />
Q. Is there talk of a fire shield spell for elemental shaman to use like water shield for restoration shaman?<br />
A. Not at this time. <br />
<br />
Q. Do you still have plans to implement guild housing?<br />
A. Guild housing isn't a priority. Aside from the huge development involved it gets people out of cities and into these private areas other players can't see. We like cities to feel populated. But I'm not sure anyone expected WoW to be going as strong as it is after five years, so who knows in the future. <br />
<br />
Q. Can you please explain why Feign Death is still on the Spell Hit metric, especially in raids?<br />
A. It's a known issue, but just has to do with the way the spell is set up. Melee and ranged attacks mean a very specific thing to the game engine. We're hoping to be able to clean up some of this with the Cataclysm overhaul. <br />
<br />
Q. All specs get a proc weapon from ICC25, except frost death knights and feral druids. Any plans to give these specs ICC25 proc weapons?<br />
A. It's tough when you get into the design mode of &quot;everyone must be able to get something from every boss.&quot; We try to cover a reasonable spread of players, but as with the Ashen Verdict rings and the Quelâ€™delar, there are going to be some specs skipped over. We still love you.<br />
<br />
Q. What is your stance on fire mage single target dps in comparison to arcane?<br />
A. Fire mage is a little low. It's also somewhat self-selecting because the most dps-obsessed players know arcane is higher and will gravitate accordingly. Fire will do better on multi-target fights, but there just haven't been a lot of those so far. (We have adds, but they come in slowly.) Ideally fire would be closer to arcane.<br />
<br />
Q. Icecrown introduced new gameplay mechanics similar to that of platform games/consoles. Will you continue this trend in Cataclysm?<br />
A. Many of you guys and many of us have been playing WoW for a long time. We think it's important to keep introducing new things to keep it feeling exciting and fresh. Some things work and we try and improve them over time. Some don't work as well and we move on. We try to never move too far away from the core experience of swinging your sword / tossing a spell though. <br />
<br />
Q. Any plans to increase the size of the backpack?<br />
A. Yeah, it's something we discuss a lot. On the other hand, the madness has to end somewhere. I'm not sure I want a 100 slot bag with that much stuff to manage. We'd need to make sure you could easily upgrade the existing backpack; we wouldn't want anyone to manage to just be without any bags.<br />
<br />
Q. Siege weapons were a unique game mechanic for Ulduar. What was the reasoning for not adding some form of Siege engine encounter in ICC?<br />
A. We didn't want to overdo it. In some ways the Ulduar vehicles was our chance to show that yes we can make vehicles a lot of fun (after say the experience of Malygos). Flame Leviathan was unique. The boat battle in Icecrown is unique. Not every raid needs siege tanks. <br />
<br />
Q. Why were party leader rewards for the random heroic daily removed?<br />
A. We didn't want to encourage players who had no business leading groups to do so.<br />
<br />
Q. When we reach level 58 in Cataclysm on Azeroth do we need to go to Outlands or can we continue leveling in Azeroth?<br />
A. You eventually need to do the Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King content. Azeroth will have a break in content between 60 and 80.<br />
<br />
Q. Any plans on looking at balance druids, in particular to Eclipse procs? RNG sometimes is detrimental to our dps.<br />
A. We don't mind the RNG aspect that much per se, but losing an important proc because it happened at the wrong time (say just before you moved) is a problem. We have a pretty cool solution for Cataclysm if we can make it work. It makes Eclipse cooler but also gives Balance more of a kit in general.<br />
<br />
Q. Paladin armor has gone all dark and gothic. When will we see armor that better represents iconic holy warriors?<br />
A. Northrend is a pretty dark and gloomy place. Cataclysm will have more of an emphasis on say elements and dragons.<br />
<br />
Q. Why is it tanking or healing that makes an encounter hard or easy? There isn't much other than high dps to consider for damage dealers.<br />
A. There are berserk timers that usually rest on the shoulders of the dps to beat. There are adds that need to be burned down, etc. Tanking and healing aren't that hard on Deathbringer IMO (for example). Managing the adds is the key. <br />
<br />
Q. Why is there hardly anything in Crystalsong Forest? It is a shame to see such a beautiful zone go to waste!<br />
A. Yeah, it makes us sad. Part of the problem is that it sits beneath Dalaran, which ended up being more of a resource hog than we had anticipated. We didn't want to draw too many more players to that zone. Initially the Crusader's Coliseum was going to be there, which is why some of the quests send you there. We just worried too much about the performance hit. Anub'arak ended up working out well though in Northrend.<br />
<br />
Q. Wrath of the Lich King and Icecrown Citadel showed Blizzard using cut scenes more for dramatic purposes. Will you go back and add more for old world events?<br />
A. We'd love to, but those things are not trivial to create so when we do more, I suspect they will be to tell new stories for Cataclysm rather than revisit old ones.<br />
<br />
Q. When will we be able to fight the Lich King?<br />
A. After you can conquer the Blood, Frost and Plague wings. :)<br />
<br />
Q. With the new skins for druid forms, what is the chance that warlocks might see race/faction specific demon skins or maybe a new one?<br />
A. When you look around, there are a lot of say imp or voidwalkers we could use. It's something we talk about quite a bit. As for new demons, I hear warlocks are going to be getting some new spells for the next expansion...<br />
<br />
Q. Why were no new daily quests (or something along those lines) added in 3.3?<br />
A. We just have a limited amout of content we can do for a patch, even a big one. We try to offer something for everyone, but sometimes it's better to deliver something awesome in one area (in this case, the raid and 3 dungeon wings) than try and add a little bit everywhere. <br />
<br />
Q. Both balance druids (moonkin) and elemental shaman feel like their dps is falling behind in Icecrown Citadel. Any damage boosts for these hybrid casters currently planned?<br />
A. We have small buffs coming in the next patch. We'll see where they are after that when more encounters are open (including the hard modes) and once more players have tier sets and higher gear in general. We have no problem buffing them more if we need to.<br />
<br />
Q. I don't have a question but just a thanks. Thank you for making the Looking For Group tool. It's sooooo useful.<br />
A. Yeah, we love it around the office too. There was a lot of pressure to get it right after the first couple of attempts were lackluster. I try not to say stuff like this too often, but I think we really got it right. (Though there are a few kinks to unkink and polish we still plan to add.)<br />
<br />
Q. How much will the incremental buff over time in Icecrown increase health, damage, and healing?<br />
A. We haven't completely decided, but something like 5%, similar to the Luck of the Draw buff.<br />
<br />
Q. Any plans to make early leveling dungeons (Maraudon, Wailing Caverns, etc.) more new-player-friendly (ie. take less time)?<br />
A. Yes. We can't overhaul them all, but Cataclysm in a world with the Dungeon Finder means we should try and improve these.<br />
<br />
Q. Were there any boss concepts you had for Icecrown Citadel that got cut? Any examples you can give?<br />
A. There was early talk of different famous NPCs that could have been corrupted instead of Saurfang Jr.<br />
<br />
Q. Arthas has been present everywhere in the expansion. Why haven't we seen Blood Queen Lanaâ€™thel, Professor Putricide or any of the other bosses in low level zones?<br />
A. Because we hadn't created them yet. :) You saw plenty of a certain undead dragon however.<br />
<br />
Q. Will there be any more developments on enchanting as a profession? We would love to do fun things like daily quests.<br />
A. Sounds like a great thing to add for Cataclysm. We'll have to wait and see though. <br />
<br />
Q. Would you be willing to make personal bank storage look more like guild storage and available to all characters on a realm?<br />
A. This is something we discuss a lot. It actually helps with keeping mail volume down as well as a player convenience.<br />
<br />
Q. Will Mal'ganis have any involvement in patch 3.3?<br />
A. He will continue to menace you in Culling of Stratholme. :)<br />
<br />
Q. Will mages ever get to be the true masters of ports? By added more than just the main city's or maybe decide our own areas?<br />
A. We've been growing the number of places they can go over time. We'll probably never get to the point where mages ignore ships, mounts or flight paths.<br />
<br />
Q. Will the various faction leaders such as Tyrande and Cairne play a part in 3.3 or will they be marginalized?<br />
A. We have a lot of NPCs active in the Northrend finale already. I'm not sure those two specifically need to play a big part. At some point your cast of characters is just too big to manage. The finale is a pretty major lore moment though. You'll dig it.<br />
<br />
Q. Have you considered making the Battered Hilt BoP?<br />
A. Because better items would be available so quickly in the Icecrown raid, we thought we'd get more dynamic gameplay by letting players trade it. It also mirrored the first Quel as well.<br />
<br />
Q. Will Ner'zhul appear at any point in 3.3 or the near future?<br />
A. Well, he is a chunk of the Lich King now. But if you mean will he appear as an orc, we're not ready to tell his story just yet. We have a lot of stories left to tell, but his is a good one.<br />
<br />
Q. Are there any plans to change the Ashen Verdict tank ring to proc more often? The current uptime vs bosses is almost nonexistent.<br />
A. We have been adjusting a lot of procs so far and this one is on our radar. Tanks still manage to avoid hits a lot, which makes the proc less useful. <br />
<br />
Q. With all the mention of saronite, and old gods blood in the various 3.3 quest chains, will Yogg-Saron factor into Icecrown Citadel?<br />
A. You mean your guild didn't kill him? :)<br />
<br />
Q. Are there plans to improve the Dwarven Racials? At this point anything is better than Find Treasure.<br />
A. Well, we are adding Archaeology to WoW...<br />
<br />
Q. You mentioned pet scaling being added for patch 3.3 but due to time constraints, was delayed. Will this be in the next patch?<br />
A. We'll try to do what we can. Technically it's just more challenging than you might think. For Cataclysm, we have on our list that 100% of stats scale. If they don't then certain stats just won't be as valuable for pet classes. At the very least, we can do stuff like convert your X into damage for the pet so every stat is valuable. Getting everyone to scale with every stat better is a major goal for the class team for Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Q. Does Blizzard have anything in the works to offer former players of WoW?<br />
A. Maybe we can give you a good reason to come back!<br />
<br />
Q. You added Armor-&gt;Strength talents to discourage Plate from wanting DPS leather. Are there any plans to stop non-clothies from wanting Cloth?<br />
A. Yes, we do have some plans. <br />
<br />
Q. Are there more plans for unique weapon procs as the game goes forward? How do you see this affecting min/maxing?<br />
A. We want to keep adding procs (and other interesting mechanics) to keep the items from feeling exactly like the item it's replacing with a few more stats. We know they are harder to balance, but that's part of the fun.<br />
<br />
Q. City raiding seems like a great way to promote Horde vs. Alliance PVP, will there be additional incentives for this?<br />
A. We like the idea of fighting in cities. We don't like the idea of massive lag from having so many people in one area or players who are just wanting to play the AH or whatever getting nuked. We have some ideas for Cataclysm though.<br />
<br />
Q. Can we expect a Canadian style pet for the Olympics this year?<br />
A. I will put in a request today for an epic moose mount, not sure if it will make it in though.<br />
<br />
Q. What are your opinions on Shadowmourne as a death knight tanking weapon?<br />
A. Shadowmourne was designed as a dps weapon. If you can score one and want to socket stamina in it, I suggest parading around Dalaran just to rub it in.<br />
<br />
Q. Have you thought about doing AP scaling for Thorns?<br />
A. There's no polite way to say this: Thorns needs some love. We just want to keep effects like this from excessively punishing fast-swinging attackers, because you know, we love rouges.<br />
<br />
Q. Will rogues/hunters ever be able to dual wield hand-crossbows or pistols?<br />
A. The pistol idea for hunters gets suggested a lot. It could either be an alternate to the gun / bow / crosssbow or something they use for short-range attacks. Rogues probably have plenty of weapons at this point. :)<br />
<br />
Q. Are there any plans to fix the relative value of stats for certain specs? Eg.Strength being way better than Armor Penetration for Retribution Paladins or Armor Penetration being way better than Haste for Marksmanship Hunters.<br />
A. For Cataclysm, absolutely. We'll do what we can in the meantime, but it's cruel to make players re-gear when they're halfway through a new raid tier.<br />
<br />
Q. For those of us who collect tabards and armor sets, do you see a way for us to store and not use our very limited inventory?<br />
A. Yes. We'd like to store them the same way you do titles. In general, we don't want to punish the packrats out there who just like to collect stuff. We will have to wait and see what we can do about it though.<br />
<br />
Q. Will we see any new world bosses in the near future?<br />
A. I'd never say never given that we haven't designed patch 6.0 yet, but they do present some problems for large organized groups trying to make mutliple attempts without interference.<br />
<br />
Q. If there is one thing that you wanted to have added to ICC/WOTLK in general, what would that have been?<br />
A. More Azjol-Nerub. Threre's a lot of things we could have done with the underground empire, from a raid zone to a world zone. I hope we get to someday. Personally, I'm a big fan of the whole underdark vibe. <br />
<br />
Q. Are heirloom items and the recruit a friend system going to work at the start of Cataclysm, in particular for Worgens?<br />
A. Most likely heirlooms. For recruit a friend, we'll have to see. We understand some players want to get to the end game as fast as possible. Maybe the realm first achievements should state &quot;without XP bonuses.&quot; :)<br />
<br />
Q. How will you handle beta testing if you don't want to spoil the Worgen/Goblin starting areas?<br />
A. We didn't want to spoil them in Blizzcon. I imagine they will be in the beta. On the other hand, you can play the new higher-level zones if you don't want to spoil it. The goblin starting zone will blow your mind!<br />
<br />
Q. Will we ever see proper physics/animation for chain weapons? Will we ever GET chain weapons?<br />
A. We'd love to. Whips too. It's just expensive (in terms of time) and we have to prioritize if it comes at the expense of something else (new dances maybe, or the animation for a new Cataclysm mob).<br />
<br />
Q. Will you guys have Worgen/Goblin race change on lock until somebody on the realm gets to level 85 as a Worgen/Goblin?<br />
A. We'll probably delay it for a few weeks or months. We haven't fully decided. <br />
<br />
Q. What will Cataclysm have to offer for solo players?<br />
A. Cataclysm has a ton of new quests both in the new zones and in old familiar areas. There will be just a ton to do. Also if you're a completionist casual type, one word: Archaeology.<br />
<br />
Q. Why not give all the races the ability to be every class?<br />
A. We're getting pretty close to that in Cataclysm. Some combos just don't make sense though. Goblin paladins strike me as bizzare.<br />
<br />
Q. Will Cataclysm bring the return of special-proc items such as The Unstoppable Force?<br />
A. One of the fun aspects of looking at those old zones are the chances to try and hit up all the nostalgia for things like that. So, yes.<br />
<br />
Q. What knowledge have you gained from WotLK/ICC in regards to your future design plans for Cataclysm?<br />
A. That's a broad question for just 140 characters! I'll say one thing we learned in retrospect was that the progressive badge structure has ended up confusing. We have a simpler one in mind that accomplishes the same goals.<br />
<br />
Q. Will you be emphasizing more on Horde vs. Alliance hatred in the future?<br />
A. It's a major focus for Cataclysm. Neither Garrosh nor Varian is a major fan of cross-faction cooperation.<br />
<br />
Q. What's up with the pineapple wallpaper in Gadgetzan?<br />
A. You will soon see in Cataclysm that goblins have a somewhat inscrutable sense of taste. They also like tropical drinks.<br />
<br />
Q. Will Trolls ever get either their own capitol, or a district in Orgrimmar like the Gnome district in Ironforge?<br />
A. Personally, I think it adds a little to the troll story that they have such an amazing cultural legacy and have fallen so far from that in recent history. That said, we have a little bit of love for trolls in Cataclysm (beyond the ability to be just about every class in the game). <br />
<br />
Q. Following the upcoming protection warrior PvP nerf, do you plan to make our abilities focus on doing threat instead of damage?<br />
A. We are applying threat modifiers where we nerfed damage. We'd also like to boost sustained protection warrior damage (for PvE) without adding too much burst (for PvP). <br />
<br />
And the final question is:<br />
<br />
Q. Did Ghostcrawler ever give out those ponies he promised?<br />
A. First, are you a paladin? If so, then no ponies for you. Everyone else can have a very small pony. In the DK case, a very, very small hero pony. <br />
<br />
Arena Rewards FAQ<br />
Q. How can I get the Gladiator title?<br />
A. You need to be in top 0.5% of the total amount of active teams in either the 3v3 or 5v5 brackets at the end of an arena season.<br />
<br />
Q. When does the season end?<br />
A. Official announcements are made to provide at least a two week warning when the end of a season is approaching. These announcements for North American realms are posted in the PvP forum here: http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/board.html?forumId=11117&amp;sid=1<br />
<br />
Q. What rewards are given out when an arena season ends?<br />
A. The end of season rewards include the titles Challenger for the top 10% to 35% of active teams in the battlegroup, Rival for the top 3% to 10% of active teams in the battlegroup, Duelist for the top 0.5% to 3% of active teams in the battlegroup, and Gladiator for the top 0.5% of active teams in the battlegroup. Players that earn the Gladiator title also receive a special permanent mount to signify their accomplishments in the arena.<br />
<br />
Q. What Personal Rating (PR) must I have to qualify for the end of season rewards?<br />
A. There is no specific personal rating amount required, but you need to be within 100 personal rating of the team rating.<br />
<br />
Q. What percentage of games must I play on my team to qualify for the end of season rewards?<br />
A. You need to have played in at least 20% of the games that your team has competed in.<br />
<br />
Q. How many games do I need to play to qualify for the end of season rewards?<br />
A. You need to have played in at least 20 games on your team.<br />
<br />
Q. What is an &quot;inactive&quot; team?<br />
A. A team is &quot;inactive&quot; if the team has not played at least 20 games, there is no one in the team with 20%+ games played, or no one within 100 Personal Rating. Inactivity status has nothing to do with how often you play. Any inactive team is disqualified from the end of the season rewards.<br />
<br />
Q. Do I need to play in the last week to be able to get Gladiator?<br />
A. No, you don't have to play in the last week.<br />
<br />
Q. If I transfer to another realm after the season ends but before I get my title and drake will they still get to me?<br />
A. No. You must wait for titles/drakes to be distributed and then transfer afterward.<br />
<br />
Q. How do players get the Relentless Gladiator title?<br />
A. At the end of each season, the number 1 ranked teams from the 3v3/5v5 brackets in each battlegroup get the title of that arena season. For season 7 it is Relentless Gladiator and season 8 it will be Wrathful Gladiator. If multiple teams are tied for the top spot, they will all get this title.<br />
<br />
Q. Do I get to keep my title forever?<br />
A. The Challenger, Rival, Duelist and Gladiator titles are redistributed at the end of each season based on your teamâ€™s performance. So for example, if you get a Gladiator title at the end of season 7, when season 8 ends you will get a new title based on your performance specifically for season 8. The only title that is permanent is the one awarded for the #1 ranked teams each season. <br />

Maraudon level bug<br />
The incorrectly flipped levels on the two colors of Maraudon will be addressed in a future patch. I also fixed the maggot generator in Orange. Thanks for the reports. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/12/22418708581-maraudon--purple-and-orange.html))<br />
<br />
Limited attempts in Icecrown Citadel<br />
The purpose of the limited attempts is to really challenge players and we felt that was a really important aspect of Icecrown Citadel as the grand finale to the story of Wrath of the Lich King. We know that a lot of players want to get access to everything and defeat it the second it's released, but having a system like this helps provide additional challenges and for those who may not be able to overcome them, things will get easier over time through additional attempts, better gear, and eventually the buff.<br />
<br />
Since it also relates to difficulty, I wanted to mention that you will not be required to clear the Plagueworks before entering the Crimson Hall or the Frostwing Halls. Each wing is independent and you are free to explore them in the order of your choice once they are open.<br />
<br />
In order to be deemed worthy to face the Lich King however, all three of these wings must be cleared. In addition, Professor Putricide, Blood Queen Lana'thel, and Sindragosa must also be defeated on heroic to face the Lich King on heroic mode.<br />
<br />
Challenges await, so good luck! (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/12/22418858152-limited-attempts-on-normal-modes.html))</div></div><hr />

It'd really be awesome if we bought expansions for content that existed, not just to give them a shot of extra cash on top of their giant stack while they work on making it later. There is ZERO reason other than GREED for blizz to be charging for expansion packs. A mmo with 250k players, yes. A mmo with 1mil players, yeah maybe them too. But ~10 mil ( i don't know what the current numbers are ), there is no reason. They have massive profits and content should be covered by the $15 monthly fee. Thats the reason it exists.</div></div><hr />

WoW isn't a necessity.<br />
<br />

You don't seem to grasp the concept of capitalism. It is the least worst system available and is the reason why you have your computers and supermarkets packed with a huge range of goods.<br />
<br />
Vote with your cash: If you think its too expensive, don't pay. Then they will put the price down. <br />
<br />
Think of your $15 as the huge cost of the bandwidth you use, the cost of maintaining GM support, the cost of fixing bugs, the cost of developing the existing content.<br />
Think of your expansion cost as the price of developing the NEW content.<br />
<br />
And if your still not satisfied I suggest you go to North Korea or one of the poorer provinces of China so you can see how an economy works without the &quot;profit motive&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Q. Following the upcoming protection warrior PvP nerf, do you plan to make our abilities focus on doing threat instead of damage?<br />
A. We are applying threat modifiers where we nerfed damage. We'd also like to boost sustained protection warrior damage (for PvE) without adding too much burst (for PvP).<br />

The purpose of the limited attempts is to really challenge players and we felt that was a really important aspect of Icecrown Citadel as the grand finale to the story of Wrath of the Lich King. We know that a lot of players want to get access to everything and defeat it the second it's released, but having a system like this helps provide additional challenges and for those who may not be able to overcome them, things will get easier over time through additional attempts, better gear, and eventually the buff.<br />
<br />
I don't know if i'm the only person who feels this way but i don't see limited attempts as a challenge. I want to play World of Warcraft and blocking me or anyone from playing isn't too smart IMO.<br />
<br />
You either kill something within your allowed attempts or you fail and have to sit around waiting till next tuesday to try again, that's all fine and dandy now, but i'm sure i'm not the only person waiting for another game that interests me more then waiting 6 days to play wow again.<br />
<br />
Kael'thas was a challenge, Vash'j was a challenge, getting to and killing Illidan was a challenge, M'uru was a challenge, making something hard that we can wipe (play) against for however long it takes is a challenge; Limited attempts is boring since we can't play the game we're buying, i like to play 20-25hrs a week not be limited to 5-10hrs by some fake so called challenge.</div></div><hr />

I think this is just merely an exception simply because this is the last content patch for Wrath of the Lich King.

I agree ( though BT was too easy IMO )... but I'm thinking blizz has kind of run out of things they can do raid encounter wise with their current &quot;rule set&quot;. They've slowly lumped everyone into categories, dps/heal/tank with buff/debuff X/Y/Z and encounters can be a burn, burn with adds, burn with movement, or gimmick X/Y/Z ... They need to fundamentally change *something* ( i don't know what ) about how we play as a core to make encounters interesting / challenging again.<br />
<br />
They'll be moving back to mana management for healers in cata, that will help, but its kinda just backhanded way of returning downranking, just that Rank 4 and Rank 8 of a given heal have two different names. Anyways, I preferred downranking and its &quot;strategy&quot;.<br />
<br />
As for other roles ... DPS rotations can only get so complex before they're just not fun ( Feral kitty for example is probably a bit too far ), IMO Longer cooldowns and interactions / combos between other classes should be developed further ... Something that other MMO's have built into their combat engines, such as FFXI. But this would be a drastic change to the game and probably something they aren't willing to risk.<br />
<br />
Things such as Siege engines and being transformed into beasts / pets ... Meh, its mostly stupid and not fun, Putricide is probably the right way of doing something like that ( one person has to do the silliness ). Flame Levi is just not a raid encounter, its too much of a non-unique experience...<br />

Unique Experiences are something this game is severely lacking on. In my opinion.<br />

I for one don't think your a whiner. I don't hate WoW, i don't want to quit WoW, but i want to play and what i enjoy is raiding and they're killing raiding either by making it too easy or by stopping us from actually playing once hard modes are released you'll do your 10 attempts and you'll either kill it or be SOL and be bored with nothing to do for 4-5 days. If they want me playing WoW 5-10hrs a week and some other MMO 10-15hrs a week they aren't too bright once a game that can give them competition comes out.</div></div><hr />

We try and try to get some kind of respons and all we get is standard answers as 'Spam the Report Lag button harder' or 'Lag is mostly due to addons and damage meters'. Instead of fixing the problem Blizzard have decided to ignore us and the problem and hope guilds just transfer away to a lowpopulated server and slowly die out. MMO-Champions as big as they are, should focus on these kind of problem aswell since alot of people are affected by these problem.<br />

Limited attempts in Icecrown Citadel is a joke especially when you play on a highpopulated old lag servers. It's not doable at all besides late after midnight. This is a joke to do 'attempts' when the hardware behind cannot handle it.</div></div><hr />

A. Many of you guys and many of us have been playing WoW for a long time. We think it's important to keep introducing new things to keep it feeling exciting and fresh.

Having limited tries is an aweful idea, 50 in togc isn't that bad, quite a large ammount and while progressing you shouldn't loose to many by time you get to anub, but the 10 attempts on putricide is stupid.. My guild raids 3 times a week, usually 2 and we haven't tried him on 25 man yet, we killed him on 10 man on our third attempt, the first try we had a healer dc = 1 wasted attempt<br />
Then we had stupid server lag and a few people managed to die because of that and then we got lucky on our third and final attempt by having no lag and dcs... Attempts on a boss are ridiculus, don't make the boss hard make it very very hard and cut out the number of attempts remaining bullshit</div></div><hr />

Playing a ok geared rogue, I do not second this. it blows to do 60-70% of my dps in a 10 man simply because i'm the only melee that night, and handing the 4 caster dps the buffs makes more sense then handing me the melee buffs. Have you ever tried to get dps wars in pugs to &quot;sunder&quot;? that doesn't happen. I'm also sick of my dps swinging by 3-4k because of buffs or lack there of.

Apart from Azeroth being polished up to today's gameplay standards, how our characters function being overhauled, itemization being reworked, guild leveling which will improve MMO gaming, archaeology which will improve character customization, new spells and abilities which will be given to players, new race/class combinations, two new races being added to the mix, the five new levels you can gain, endgame content that's newly created just for you, getting to see Deathwing at last?<br />
<br />
Yeah, apart from that - no reason to buy that expansion pack.</div></div><hr />

I want to play World of Warcraft and blocking me or anyone from playing isn't too smart IMO.<br />
<br />
You either kill something within your allowed attempts or you fail and have to sit around waiting till next tuesday to try again, that's all fine and dandy now, but i'm sure i'm not the only person waiting for another game that interests me more then waiting 6 days to play wow again.<br />
<br />
Kael'thas was a challenge, Vash'j was a challenge, getting to and killing Illidan was a challenge, M'uru was a challenge, making something hard that we can wipe (play) against for however long it takes is a challenge; Limited attempts is boring since we can't play the game we're buying, i like to play 20-25hrs a week not be limited to 5-10hrs by some fake so called challenge.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What's is the diference between killing him in the 1st night and not killing him after the 10 allowed attemps at the same 1st night regarding the rest of your week?<br />
<br />
Ah, your shiny epics... got it... everything end up beeing all about shiny drops...<br />
<br />
Don't see something that you can just throw money on endless repair bills/mats as a challenge... I do see decent raids (that are totally against their new &quot;baddies payed for their loot too and should down everything even if it needs to be dumbed down&quot; philosophy) as a challenge.<br />
<br />
I see the limited attempts coupled with the server/dcs as a real problem that you have all the rights in complaining, but not the &quot;I payed and want to zerg it all night without thinking about my last attempt and your system don't let me do it!&quot; as a problem.<br />
<br />
Looks like you don't play the 10man version (or the 25), since you say you have 6 days of waiting... but if you do everything in one night... then there is nothing blizzard can do to make you play that raid/boss for more than one day anyways...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I dunno... to me... as a long time player, and raider... I'd rather have a &quot;planes of power&quot; (eq) type of expansion where the majority of content is large scale raids.<br />
<br />
Yes, a revamped Azeroth sounds like a great idea. And oooooh it'll be shinier, but that isn't &quot;content&quot; to me, its fluff that'll I'll be doing some quest to kill 10 rats on, except this time it'll be in the barrens, with a rocket pack or some stupid pet/siege weapon. My character is still a super-low poly joke where if you're zoomed out more than 10yards you can't distinguish against any other of my race/class. And don't get me started on gearsets. They continually fail to give players on an equal tier of raiding look anywhere near unique, save for say someone holding a warglaive or an overly fancy staff ( horde-TOC reindeer one for example ).<br />
<br />
How about giving us more completed, ready to go, tuned, and not buggy raid encounters out of the box?<br />
BC had, Kara which was &quot;mostly&quot; complete, Gruul stupidly hard (9k shatters was too much for &quot;entry level&quot;) SSC was completely untuned and the rest were &quot;on their way&quot;. Blizz had us farming old content for months awaiting the next step to be unlocked finished being made. Itemization wasn't even completely. Blues better than Epics, Tier 5 was less itemization points than Tier 4. Took them ~2 months to rebalanced everything.<br />
Lich King we got Naxx, which had from what I saw zero graphical changes, so it was all &quot;under the hood&quot; and frankly that doesn't take a huge amount of time/effort, Maly + Sarth are one roomers, and I don't even know the timeline for Ulduar being &quot;ready&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
But I guess its really all stupid for a raider to ask for more raiding content, we're what, 1-10% of their subscriber base? They'll pack the majority of new content into leveling, quests, 5mans, and &quot;phone it in&quot; cute crap, and raiding will get a tiny slice of pie that is just barely enough to keep us holding on while we pray that they aren't fucking up the new Star Wars MMO.<br />

<br />
The only thing stopping them from considering &quot;goblin paladins&quot; to be an acceptable combination is their own desire to make it so. That is why people are throwing &quot;tauren paladin&quot; up at this comment. No one -ever- considered tauren paladins until blizzard added the quest.<br />
<br />
It is not fair to give an absurd class/race combo as an example to dismiss a question when EVERYONE knows that the ONLY thing standing between any race/class combo is a token quest to add it into lore.<br />
<br />
Anyways, If blizzard put in a quest explaining that now Dragons would spit flowers out at you instead of fire/shadow/frost breath... would it be so obviously acceptable? Shit... now they're probably gonna do that in the emerald dream...</div></div><hr />

if they make this debuff i think that will improve arena ALOT and it will be much better and more interesting to play cause then healer could survive at least first opening :-\-for example 2 dps nuke in 2v2(ret/rouge... :-[) and u wouldn't depend on combo that much.i think they need to put it in s8,that will bring more ppl to arena.that's my opinion ??? ;D</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If they did that, demand would drop, and that queue time would go up to 30 min or more.<br />
<br />
You want shorter instances, for shorter queue times... so instead of running the instance once every hour and a half, you can run it 3 times in one hour (example quantities and times to illustrate the point).<br />
<br />
Overall, you will see a greater exp/hour by getting to kill more trash and more bosses across multiple runs, than spending all of your time in one instance.</div></div><hr />

Either I have missed something or you haven't done the chain in Icecrown, where players find out that Mal'Ganis is pretty alive possesing the corpse of Grand admiral Barean Westwind and upon defeat, shouts out some fancy lines saying, that we won't kill the Lizard King without his help.

I think you mean Mixed Economy, because capitalism is far from fool-proof. Maybe profit driven market results in higher standards of living for hard workers and innovators, but it's ruthless to the disadvantaged citizens, which leads to a horrifying gap between different social classes, and ends basically in a material-driven culture that values jets and fly cars over humanism.<br />
<br />

So basically, Mal'Ganis's storyline is finished? What a pathetic end for a promising character. Sigh, Mal'Ganis and Bolvar were the only characters i was looking forward to see in Lich Kings fight.<br />
<br />
<br />
They have stated that the Lich King encounter will be the most epic fight they've ever done, what if they just don't want to spoil it to loregasmic people that Mal'ganis will, infact, be in the Lich King encounter? It can still happen :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
While I agree with you on the mixed economy (if we both agree that disadvantaged can never be defined as &quot;too lazy to keep down or look for a job/felon&quot;), you're missing the point. Blizzard has found the golden market price - this entire debate started with what basically amounted to: Why isn't my WoW free? WoW isn't free because WoW cost's resources - and Blizzard seems to have found that golden price where Consumer Surplus, Producer Surplus, and Societal Surplus are at the maximum rates.<br />
<br />
This does not mean that anyone should be able to get it - this means that if you value WoW equal to or more than the Market Price, you willingly purchase WoW (because there is no such thing as an unwilling deal - regardless about price complaints). At this point, with all taxes included, lowering the market price would most likely result in a decrease of total surplus of the market.<br />
<br />
In other words, to the guy complaining about Cata's Price: No one is forcing you to buy it because no one can force you to buy it.</div></div><hr />

Sadly, Mother Nature, has 'programmed' us 'human beings' (read: mammals/animals) to prioritize consumerism over conservation. As it has prioritized survival over reproduction and egotism over humanism.<br />
<br />
In other words: survival is more important than fucking, jamming stuff down our pieholes is more important than being eco-friendly and being individually happy is more important than being socially interdependant.</div></div><hr />

I don't see why Blizzard should charge us for the next expansion. &gt;.&gt;<br />
<br />
Perhaps it was difficult for you to understand my statement?<br />
<br />
An mmo with 250k subs, they design their game, sell their boxed copy and make back their initial production costs. I give the example of 250k subs, because it has been mentioned by other mmo makers ( and I couldn't find the quote if you asked me ) that &quot;yes indeed we are profitable at only 250k subs, and its considered a success for us&quot;.<br />
<br />
Anyways, back to the money. With the each sub you subtract your server maintenance and customer support (which we assume is at an acceptable level of quality, this includes costs for developing bug fixes and minor patches ). This is the flat amount for each, and we'll just say that its 75%. It could possibly be this high (or higher?) if you're including all the low-hourly wage employees at Blizzard. ( Since upper echelon salary employees get a performance / sales based bonus )<br />
<br />
Soo with 250k subs they get $937,500 per month that can be left for ongoing updates (something MMO's promise in their nature) , future development, or profit.<br />
<br />
The wow example, of say, 10 million subs would get $37,500,000 a month for the same things.<br />
<br />
Now, lets say we're looking at a 1.5yr cycle for my argument of charging for expansions or not.<br />
<br />
18mo x 937,500 = 16 mil<br />
18mo x 37,500,000 = 675 mil<br />
<br />
Sooo over the 18 months of time that mmo is running with these subs. Development of a large content patch ( an expansion ), costs both of them say, $25 mil ( again, its less ).<br />
<br />
Our small time mmo with only 250k subs clearly needs a shot in the arm of cash to be able to reach that number, so $40 x 250k gives them that extra $10 mil they needed to cover their costs.<br />
<br />
WoW on the other hand, has more than enough money to develop continuing free content patches, and more than enough to pay for its next expansion AND continue to be very very very ridiculously profitable.<br />
<br />
Now, I must admit my numbers are skewed, but I believe i have been very conservative in the actual numbers and they are making more than this per sub. The only quickly gathered evidence is this:<br />
<br />
$200 million. Or, at least that's what Blizzard disclosed during yesterday's analyst conference call.<br />

This, my friend, is why it is bullshit for us to continue having to pay for expansions, and why I am &quot;bitching&quot; so much. They are making unheard of returns on their work, and they'll seek more and more ( Ahem blizz pet store ), unless we as a consumer steps up and says &quot;Excuse me but no, this isn't right &quot;.</div></div><hr />

No..., I understood what you said. I will admit that blizzard makes alot more then what is needed to maintain there servers, and develop new content. Even with the recent banned in China.<br />
<br />
My point is that, It still costs them something to develop expansions. Sure it's only a fraction of what they make annually and yes, as you mentioned they could afford to give it out for free. But unless it actually did cost them absolutely nothing to develop new content, I don't see why it's so wrong of them to charge you money.. <br />
<br />
But seriously, is a $14.95/month subscription or a however much an expansion cost in the US? that outrageous of a price to pay for something you enjoy?<br />
<br />
Seriously if WoW was to charge $100 for an expansion, or even raise the price of their subscription fee. While yes i would be abit angry, but I'd still pay for it, and I know most likely the majority of WoW players will still continue to pay it, because it keeps me entertained and I think it's well worth the money.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yes, they can afford to give it away for free - but it may surprise you that it would in fact lower the total surplus of the market. I said it once, I'll say it again in case you mixed it - the stability of the price of WoW (that it hasn't changed dramatically of the past five years) is indicative that it has reached the current equilibrium price. This means that Consumer Surplus and Producer Surplus, as well as Social Surplus are at the three way maximum (the maximum surplus possible for each individual sector without lowering the total surplus of the market).<br />
<br />
If WoW did not cost anything, the government could not tax it - which means that while consumer surplus would be at it's absolute maximum, total surplus would drop significantly - after all, there are a significant number of consumers who value WoW at negative levels (that is, they wouldn't play it even if it was free).<br />
<br />
What Blizzard has done with their price is balance an equation where the money they make, the money made of taxes for social benefit, and the surplus the consumers have (determined by market elasticity) add up to the highest possible number. It's not greed, as everyone benefits.</div></div><hr />

Let me add a quote of myself to explain this (the question is in the Q&amp;A.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Q. Would you be willing to make personal bank storage look more like guild storage and available to all characters on a realm?<br />
A. This is something we discuss a lot. It actually helps with keeping mail volume down as well as a player convenience.<br />
<br />
If they actually implement it like this, I'd love it.<br />
Just being able to centralize all herbs, skins, enchanting mats, ... across all my toons would be amazing.</div></div><hr />

You seem to be missing the point here buddy. WoW is a MASSIVE multiplayer which means that it provides all its percs and stuff to the entire wow community and not just 1 player for his $15 which if u do the math like others did amounts to allot of money. Also for the guy who wants free expansions, last time I checked Blizzard is still a corporation and their only goal is to make as much money as possible which means they sell you stuff that they know you buy. No one forces you to buy the expansions to still play the game you do that because you want to.</div></div><hr />

I'd rather have a &quot;planes of power&quot; (eq) type of expansion where the majority of content is large scale raids.<br />
<br />
Yes, a revamped Azeroth sounds like a great idea. And oooooh it'll be shinier, but that isn't &quot;content&quot; to me, its fluff that'll I'll be doing some quest to kill 10 rats on, except this time it'll be in the barrens, with a rocket pack or some stupid pet/siege weapon. My character is still a super-low poly joke where if you're zoomed out more than 10yards you can't distinguish against any other of my race/class. And don't get me started on gearsets. They continually fail to give players on an equal tier of raiding look anywhere near unique, save for say someone holding a warglaive or an overly fancy staff ( horde-TOC reindeer one for example ).<br />
<br />
How about giving us more completed, ready to go, tuned, and not buggy raid encounters out of the box?<br />
BC had, Kara which was &quot;mostly&quot; complete, Gruul stupidly hard (9k shatters was too much for &quot;entry level&quot;) SSC was completely untuned and the rest were &quot;on their way&quot;. Blizz had us farming old content for months awaiting the next step to be unlocked finished being made. Itemization wasn't even completely. Blues better than Epics, Tier 5 was less itemization points than Tier 4. Took them ~2 months to rebalanced everything.<br />
Lich King we got Naxx, which had from what I saw zero graphical changes, so it was all &quot;under the hood&quot; and frankly that doesn't take a huge amount of time/effort, Maly + Sarth are one roomers, and I don't even know the timeline for Ulduar being &quot;ready&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
But I guess its really all stupid for a raider to ask for more raiding content, we're what, 1-10% of their subscriber base? They'll pack the majority of new content into leveling, quests, 5mans, and &quot;phone it in&quot; cute crap, and raiding will get a tiny slice of pie that is just barely enough to keep us holding on while we pray that they aren't fucking up the new Star Wars MMO.<br />
<br />
/shrug /endrant<br />
<br />
<br />
As someone in the other 90% of the WoW population (raiding is a mere novelty to do when bored enough to suffer through a few hours of 25 people taking forever to get their crap together), I am glad they don't spend the time it would take them to achieve your unrealistic goals. It would be twice as long between content patches for about 20% of the variety thats been introduced. Take your 10% and find a different game please until the Star Wars MMO comes out and you can bitch about how they cant do anything right with that. For pete's sake, no one gives a crap what your toon looks like from 5 yards away, let alone 10. Like we freaking need Dal to load any slower than it already does.</div></div><hr />

A. We have been talking about solutions like that. It might feel a bit awkward, but it might also solve the problem and maybe it's okay in the last season before an expansion to experiment a little bit.<br />
<br />
<br />
if they make this debuff i think that will improve arena ALOT and it will be much better and more interesting to play cause then healer could survive at least first opening :-\-for example 2 dps nuke in 2v2(ret/rouge... :-[) and u wouldn't depend on combo that much.i think they need to put it in s8,that will bring more ppl to arena.that's my opinion ??? ;D<br />
<br />
<br />
I think so too. I think the hardest thing would be tweaking the numbers. Perhaps leaning more towards -25% healing and -30% damage. I don't think there's much else they can do. They've stated multiple times that everything will effect PvE too much to be considered. So having this debuff only active during arenas and BGs, would allow them to keep everything tweaked in PvE while giving the proper balance to PvP. <br />
<br />
Seems like there's a loss of PvP in the game in general, and having more players out there arena'ing would be amazing to see. Balance is key. Although there is no perfect balance, it can get closer to that goal. Hands down I think they should experiment with this until Cataclysm.</div></div><hr />
