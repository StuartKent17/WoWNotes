Frightened Kodo Mount Guide<br />
Most of the 8.1 Darkshore rare mounts drop from specific rare mobs around the map much like the Arathi rare mounts. However, the Frightened Kodo (https://www.wowdb.com/items/166433-frightened-kodo) is acquired a little differently. Here is what we have learned about obtaining this mount:<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Frightened Kodo (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/148790-frightened-kodo) is a rare spawn on a timer (reportedly anywhere from 2-6 hours)<br />
It is a friendly NPC that must be clicked. You will receive the message &quot;Frightened Kodo nuzzles your hand. He wants to come with you!&quot; and the mount will be placed into your bags several seconds later.<br />
Only the first person who clicks the spawned mob will receive the mount. It despawns shortly after being clicked or if no one clicks it within about 2 minutes.<br />
It has 6 known spawn locations, all of which are marked on the map above. (You can find a waypoint macro on the Warcraft Secrets website (https://warcraft-secrets.com/guides/battle-for-darkshore-rewards).)<br />

41.3 54.0<br />
38.0 66.0<br />
39.2 56.5<br />
44.0 65.0<br />
<br />
Server resets seem to be a good time to check for a spawn.<br />
It is lootable by class trials and level 110's on both factions.<br />
It does not matter which faction controls Darkshore for it to spawn or be obtainable.<br />

Holy Paladin Gameplay<br />
Cleave healing. A lot of people still think we’re “tank healers” but we actually aren’t. At least not directly. If you directly heal the tanks you’re going to lose a lot of healing. This is due to how beacons work. Our niche is cleave healing and triage healing. We always heal 3 targets for the price of 1 with beacons and even up to 7 targets with LoD if you don’t directly hit your beacons. This helps smooth out tank damage quite a bit while allowing you to heal other people rather than focus solely on the tanks. The only time you’d directly heal tanks is if they’re getting destroyed and they really need extra focus but tank healing is better done from a mistweaver now. Our cleave healing is fairly good<br />
A huge misconception is that pallies are &quot;just&quot; tank healers. I was still going of this old mentality for awhile as well but now more than ever our niche is pretty well defined in a raid. If you’re doing it right we’re keeping tanks stable and spot healing the rest of the raid allowing us to pick up spots where AoE healing isn’t cutting it from the rest of the classes. (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1104621-holy-pally-isnt-fun/) / Official Forums (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/62389/20))<br />
<br />
Heart of Azeroth necklace not account wide?<br />
What weekly reduction? Oh that thing you paused a while back to increase time played metrics so people have to regrind stuff they already had when the raid launches.<br />
Ion already spoke at length about this in the last Q&amp;A but we admit it doesn’t feel good. The lack of reduction really only negatively affects very high end players pushing for absurdly high Azerite levels, we’re talking 40-44 (looking at you Myppoo you insane person you). For anything under that the levels are still within reasonable amounts to gain another level, plus 37-38 is all that you need to get ring 3 on even Mythic Dazar’alor gear.<br />
<br />
We know it doesn’t feel good to put in more work to unlock the exact same traits you just had, and we said in the last Q&amp;A that we’re working on that.

Activision Blizzard CFO Hired by Netflix<br />
Activision Blizzard's CFO, Spencer Neumann, was placed on paid leave on December 31 with the company intending to fire him. It has been confirmed that he has been hired by Netflix today.

nearly every mount in the game even current is obtainable by drops, with no waiting involved, just RNG. METAS drop a mount though all achievements. what exactly are you bitching about?</div></div><hr />

This is far easier to get than the Voidtalon. The spawns are all close to each other and the respawn timer appears to be significantly lower.<br />
I camped it around 1 1/2 days and then found it. Had the wrong strategy at first just sitting at one spawn and afking occasionally trusting NPCscan and other raretracker to detect it if I entered its ID when they didn't but there is no comparison to the voidtalon with its 2-3 spawns per week.</div></div><hr />

There are several other mounts in Darkshore that are just random drops from rare spawns, same in Arathi. There are also mounts on the doubloon and service medal vendors, on most of the rep vendors, and the standard meta achievement raid mounts.<br />
<br />
Nevermind that this is just an npc on a rare spawn timer that awards a mount to the first person who right clicks it. There is no special method other than finding it when it spawns.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, due to this post there will be more campers now but they'll come and go. Try again in 1-2 weeks and it should be better again.<br />
As I said I used NPCscan and it only went off when I mousehovered over the Kodo itself because unlike other rares it doesn't have a vignette NPCscan can search for.<br />
And since the Kodo runs around a lot it is not perfectly reliable to position the mouse where it might appear.</div></div><hr />

Are you actually serious?<br />
<br />
What the fuck does a chief financial officer need to know about gaming exactly? his job is primarily responsible for managing the company's finances. He's probably realized what a sinking ship Blizzard is and has rightly jumped ship. Good on him.<br />

<br />
I can't tell if you're just deliberately lying, insanely misinformed, or completely ignoring reality. The overwhelming majority of mounts come from &quot;achievements, drops, and so on&quot;. Suggesting that &quot;everything&quot; is an involved process like you say here is about as far from the truth as you could be.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have no idea why the Blizzard CFO getting fired and then hired by Netflix is very relevant news to us gamers.<br />

There are at least two options of what actually happened - he was in talks with Netflix a long time ago and Blizzard found out (unlikely) or this was planned by Blizzard and Netflix together, which is far more likely - fire for supposed issues and reduce shareholder anger about the falling share prices and Netflix gets their new CFO.

<br />
Wow. any word on what he supposedly did? i feel a diablo Immortal joke would make sense here.<br />
<br />
It'll be with him moving to a new company, this is quite normal at this level that when someone is moving on they're removed from their position immediately for security reasons.</div></div><hr />

Don't bother - they're going to believe what they want to believe. See the existing thread on this in general.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It would have been so they wouldn't need to give him a 'golden parachute' payout when he quit, as being fired would have meant he couldn't receive one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We'll wait.<br />
<br />
they drop like the vast majority of mounts in the game, on a weekly reset. are you farming mimrons head on the same toon 20 times a week? and my comment was referring to another individual who was bitching about problems that virtually don't exist.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For Alliance its one of the only ways to get a kodo mount. The other is the Brewsfest Kodo but that's obviously only obtainable for a limited time each year.</div></div><hr />

Most of the people who made Blizzard what it is have already dipped out. And now the guy cooking their books was already shopping for another job and Netflix was more than happy to hire him. BTW this guy was a CFO for Disney for many years before leaving to join Blizzard. So when you see someone with many years in that position looking for a way out before the ship hits the reef. Yeah there is allot of messed up crap going on behind the scenes at Blizzard and its all got Activisions money grubbing hands written all over it. I understand that people want to white knight Blizzard and champion them. But you need to realize that the people who created those wonderful memories and games that you so love. Those people are gone. You are now championing a company that still says Blizzard on the front end. But is now fully Activision on the back end. Keep that in mind before you jump up and try to defend the things that are going to come out very soon in the form of more monetary moves and less content and even less quality we are going to see going into 2019. RIP Blizzard. ALL HAIL ACTILIZZARD MONEYGRUBMENT!</div></div><hr />
