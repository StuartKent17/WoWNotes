Mount Changes in 3.2<br />
The game has gotten quite a bit longer, and allowing players to get from A to B faster only very minimally decreases difficulty; more so, it decreases time spent traveling. We don't want to discourage players from trying out the game if they have not yet, and we especially don't want to discourage existing players from trying out new characters because the leveling process from 1-80 seems too daunting after flying around Northrend grabbing purples for a while.<br />
<br />
Whether you leveled your first character from 1-60 within a month of the game's release when the leveling curve was less forgiving, and mounts seemed like a distant dream, or you leveled a character from 1-80 in the last month with mounts a little sooner, and experience gains a little accelerated from 1-70, no one's game play experience and fun -- the reason most people would play video games in their spare time in the first place -- is at all cheapened.

Boundless Gaze is bugged (Link (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/june/boundlessgaze.jpg))<br />
No, actually the Algalon helm is bugged. We'll get it fixed. Don't shard it! (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17730083833-something-must-be-wrong-here.html))<br />

PvP Gloves Bonus<br />
Yes, we are changing the older glove bonus to the new bonus. You should have -15 energy for Maim on all your PvP gloves. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17730194152-feral-maim-gloves-change-no-because.html))<br />
<br />
Innervate in Arenas<br />
It is balanced around a 6 min cooldown so in a 3 min match it provides a lot of mana and the fact that it can't be used again for a long time is small consolation when the match is over quickly.<br />
<br />
We are reluctant to balance it around being dispelled though. When dispel is the counter for everything, it just makes classes with the ability more necessary and makes those without it even weaker. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17730084376-um-blizz-innervate-hello.html))<br />

Fan of Knives in 5v5 Arenas<br />
So, last I looked today, rogues were represented in really low numbers in 5s among high rated teams (particularly considering they are over represented in 2s and 3s). So &quot;Mortal FoK&quot; doesn't seem to be winning them too many matches, at least not yet, though it could be one of those things that is annoying even if not overpowered.

Mount at lvl 20? Epic mount at lvl 40? flying mount at lvl 60? 150% flight speed for the normal flying mount?<br />
And did you have a look at the prices ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's a way to massively increase leveling speed imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
How does ease have anything to do with that? Wait, are you trying to say making gold is hard? I surely hope not.<br />
That just reduces the number of hours of farming or dailies or auction house profiteering required for a mount.<br />
The level changes are much more huge imo.</div></div><hr />

God forbid we (by we i mean players who have been active since vanilla) needed 150% flying speed at 60...or a level 40 epic ground mount...or even faction discounts. While this is good for alts this is like a slap in the face to all those players who worked and farmed towards epic flying and everything below it.<br />
<br />
p.s. blizz if you are going to charge 5k for Artisan training...make it so that if we buy it, we dont have to pay the 600 for expert, that's just a gold sink with no real point.</div></div><hr />

edit: and funny to read all the QQ, who cares if you had to pay the old prices, or gain the old faction, i had to do it one four toons already and the discount on the future toons is nice. to the QQ about some prices being too expensive still reminds me of a quote about if they lowered the monthly cost people would complain that it wasn't low enough.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard: Hey Casuals, you're bad at the game, so we're going to significantly reduce the price of things everybody else had to pay in full. Oh and for you players who did this back when it was expensive....$%^# you.<br />
<br />
Or, and this is, admittedly, a big ol' OR here...they could say<br />
<br />
Blizzard: Hey, Casuals, enjoy some reduced prices. Hey, everyone who paid full, stop acting elitist and start acting out your &quot;Back in my day...&quot; speeches. This is a good chance and anyone who says otherwise really needs to stop thinking for themselves and thinking more for everyone on a whole. Remember how bad it was to level that (insert name of class here) and have some enjoyment knowing that if you ever wanted to do it again, it'll be easier on you. Oh, and to everyone who has an alt or is about to level a Death Knight for once, this is for you. Enjoy faster leveling through Outland and faster questing in Northrend after 77!<br />
<br />
How about we stop being elitist here and just enjoy the fact that we got our stuff when it was DIFFICULT, hm? That's something we can just put up as a badge showing we're better than they are, huh? That's surely something everyone who complains about this can truly get behind.</div></div><hr />

Well, I think the trainer in Dalaran is tied to Kirin Tor. And if it isn't, then maybe they'll use Thrallmar or Honor Hold. <br />

Either way, 1000g off the epic flier at exalted...man, I hope it counts for the trainer in Dalaran.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it had been like this from the start I might have liked it, but as it stands now this game is going casual. <br />
<br />
It is obvious that Blizz is prepairing to dumb the game from its primary line up and focus on other projects. <br />
<br />
I personally can not blame them, this fall will be a 5 year aniversry of WoW and it has had a better run than nearly every other MMO out there. <br />
<br />
<br />
IMO I wonder what their new game will be like, I doubt it will be fail as they have the reputation of being one of the best, or the best of the best. <br />
<br />
Looks like SC2 and Diablo 3 are going to be the homes of most of the lost players. <br />
<br />
<br />
Theory:<br />
<br />
Top 10% of guilds will continue the content in hopes of being sponsored still, <br />
<br />
the top 11 to top 40% of PvE raiders will most likely start feeling the content is too easy, and that the Azeroth that they once loved is being corrupted by noobs that are invading their game on a whim, and will resent the lack of appreciation for old content (Onyxia who? C'Thun who?) and will move on to find something new. <br />
<br />
This in turn will see a drop in base if the new WoW MMO can not establish a hype and keep a crowed. <br />
<br />
There are three markets for people to play MMOs, 1) are the hardcore pvpers like myroomate who swares by Lineage 2, and the fact that you can gank any little shit that runs their mouth. 2) Raiders, people that wanan be presented with a challange to overcome a Boss that requires coordination and skill of 10, 25, even 40 people. And along the way enrich themselves with a fun storyline. 3) The role players, the craftsmen the people that play to enjoy the day to day stuff, of the game play. <br />
<br />
<br />
WoW had 2 well established and 3 even more so because the realm of azeroth was rich, I can recall listneing to the compelling voices of Warcraft 2, as you were prompted to battle the orcs or humans and drive them back into the dark portal. The cut scenese were wonderful, and the voices were magnificent. <br />
<br />
What once was a sense of accomplishment is dieing in azeroth, the achivmeent system is taking it over, it is drawing focus from what once was. <br />
<br />
<br />
This game will last through Wrath, but I can say this now once the lich king is dead I will not be moving onto the next exspansion, lore should have been followed or it should not have been written. I am by no means a star trek or star wars nerd, but I do appreciate what others have done to tell a story, to romanticize the virtues in life that we all strive for, and the things to have fantasies about in order to escape reality. Quite a few people on here I am sure would love to be able to practice magic, or take out aggresion from a boss pissing you off by camping this shit out of a known antagonizer. <br />
<br />
What World of Warcraft was is dieing slowly, and I hate it, WoW is now becoming the game for everyone because blizz knows they can turn a profit. <br />
<br />
Hopefully their new franchise will have the lore, it once did, allow people to take pride in what they do within the game. And differentiate themselves from others. <br />
<br />
I would rather spend years trying to accomplish what few can, than to be handed to me something everyone else has.</div></div><hr />

In response to it I say: If you want insane difficulty with little reward then stop playing a fun game and play EQ1 or FFXI. Those games fit the bill because, like your reasoning, they are behind the times. No one with half a mind wants to make MMO's endless amounts of grinds if they can help it nowadays, because playing a game and enjoying it is -fun-.</div></div><hr />

There was *nothing* wrong with the mounts as they were. Seriously, epic mounts at 40? That used to be the point at which you got the 60% mount. <br />

<br />
It is obvious that Blizz is prepairing to dumb the game from its primary line up and focus on other projects.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, because leveling is challenging.<br />
<br />
The level cap is now 80. This game has been about the endgame since TBC came out, and the only leveling content that is relevant is Northrend. The majority of players have at least one 80, and the old world is dead to any new players. The faster we can get people through it, the better.<br />
<br />
The best change imo is 150% regular flyer, which makes epic flight less of a necessity. As someone with two 80s and three more toons waiting at 75-78, I'm thrilled by this. I can bring them all to 80 and only pay 1700g per toon, instead of 7000g per toon.<br />
<br />
I've spent 14000g on my two mains, and i've paid the 1000g for an epic land mount on 3 other toons. This wasn't an accomplishment, it was a dumb money sink spent on something that is completely essential to the current endgame. I'd much rather save some of that money, get to play my alts, AND be able to afford buying nice things for my mains, oh, like a Nobles Deck for my tank's DPS set?<br />
<br />
Oh, and &quot;this makes ganking people in Outland impossible&quot;? Gimme a second while I try to care about whether some sociopathic scrub can ruin someone's day or not.<br />
<br />
Shit, can't do it.</div></div><hr />

who cares about the gold sinks, get over it. did you qq the first time you had to replace a purchased or craftable piece of gear, or do you qq each time you have to spend more money gemming and enchanting it. the game does not revolve around a limited amount of this virtual cash, you spend it you get more you spend it again. its similar to any rl event or item that requires your hard earned money. work 40+ hours a week to earn money that is out of your bank account to pay bills the day its deposited. its life get over it.</div></div><hr />

ps: to everyone in this thread that didn't buy your epic land mount pre-bc: QQ moar, mounts haven't been exclusive or difficult to attain for several years now, just a barrier of frustration at how slowly alts travel compared to your main.<br />
<br />
<br />
This. As a resto druid pre-BC, it was near impossible to farm up the gold for either a 100% mount, or to farm the gold for the daily talent changes between resto + feral to farm the gold for the 100% mount. But I'm not crying about this change, despite what hardships my druid may have faced. Because I'm an alt-o-holic, and levelling is a pain. A+ for the change, would do business with again.<br />
<br />
Also, /raise.</div></div><hr />

I've played since vanilla and I still think the change is great.<br />

This happens in everything with life. I hope you've never bought a video game, or a tv, or a computer before, if you have [which of course you have unless you're 14 and mommy and daddy buy everything for you] then the price for the exact thing you're using now, has gone down.<br />

It happens. This change should have happened a long time ago. The game is all about end-game for 90% of the player base.</div></div><hr />

Ya, we had a 25daily cap since TBC release, didn't we? Dipshit.<br />
<br />
I haven't bought epic flying on my alt, so in all technicality I should be happy about this.<br />
That said, I also think leveling content is a great part of this game; zones are intricate in design(normally), and I think there's a bit of immersion to the game that you otherwise miss by having an epic mount(or the like). On top of that; the 3 second cast time on mounts has probably led to the most world pvp fun that I've had, being at the giving or receiving end.<br />
It could be nostalgia, but I just don't like this changes, and yes it is easier. This games difficulty isn't built on pressing buttons, it never was and it never will be, its based on perseverance. May it be AQ40 rep grind, gate quest chain, ssc/bt key chain, rep grinds, badge grinds, gold grinds, I could go on. It's what this game is, so for those people saying this isn't making the game easier, it is.</div></div><hr />

The majority of people who will be taking advantage of this will not be first time users. It will be people with Alts.<br />
<br />
Get off your high horse and stop expecting Blizzard to give you something you think you deserve. It's better for the game... and I know the 4-5 alts that I am slowly leveling will enjoy the change. Certainly the two I have at level 40.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">anenigma</div><div class="date">2009-06-11, 05:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wonder how far Blizzard will go to help out those who constantly level alts, rather than trying to find new content or ideas which may keep them playing their original character(s). I used to call WoW an MMORPG, but these days I don't have much of a &quot;role&quot; which I can play. My character hates the scourge, can't change that. My night elf priest can't attack gnomes of gnomeregan, can't change that. I'm forced to &quot;play nice&quot; in Dalaran, and the argent tournament, despite what I may want to do myself. And apart from Wintergrasp, we're encouraged to PvP in instanced areas which have minimal impact on the world.<br />
<br />
Slight rant there that wandered off topic, but all these restrictions on what we can or cannot do (especially in terms of who we must be at peace with, and who we must be at war with) just eliminate the R from RPG, in my mind.<br />
<br />
As to the changes, meh. It's making levelling more attractive compared to end-game, so it feels like blizzard's saying &quot;Hey you guys who like solo questing, just level another character so we don't have to make new content for you&quot;.</div></div><hr />

The same could be said in reverse, there are a few good PvE games out there, Lord of the Rings, EQ2 are both very fun and exciting. However not many games (Are there any yet?) that compete on the level of PvP WoW does, they even based this game ON factions fighting each other so I would actually say this is a very PvP-centric game.<br />
<br />
EDIT: The game really doesn't start until you're level capped in WoW, it's almost always been that way. Leveling is just a hassle for players who've done it multiple times, people who are new to the game get tired of it, In the past there were enough players running anything so you were able to get a group almost all the time, which let things be a little more spicy, now leveling is just learning your class enough to be okay at it.</div></div><hr />

Warhammer Online is okay at best, compared to WoW's PvP it's very mild/boring and even more imbalanced. I'm looking forward to AION, I'm not sure how they are going to swing it. :)<br />

Street Fighter, Guilty Gear, King of Fighters all fit this bill. Then again, Tekken, Smash, and Soul Calibur do not. And they're in the same genre of game. Fighting is ONE aspect of the game, not THE aspect. If it was, it'd be pretty effing laughable.<br />

<br />
In a MMORPG, there should be things to look up for at higher levels. When people RAF'ing to 60, and then buying flappers, they'll bypass Outland in hours, making it yet-another-dead-zone.<br />
<br />
Levelling is made more and more individual, and it's killing the concept of doing dungeons while levelling. With this change, they doomed Outland to just be yet-another-levelling-hub to bypass.<br />
<br />
I really hope they thing about it on a long term basic, we wouldn't want this to become SWG would we now!</div></div><hr />

Seeing you never had a flying mount before, I can explain it to you:<br />
<br />
The FLYING mount have a 60% land speed. That is, if you run on the surface with it, pretending it couldn't fly.</div></div><hr />

this should solve your dilemma: mount up on a flying mount (anything but a hippogryph), land on the ground and run, don't fly. notice that you are slower than you were in the air?</div></div><hr />

I would feel better about this if it wasnt for RAF - that right there is a stupid joke. If you want a level 80 anything yes, you should have to put in the work, and no-one said levelling was 'skill' but it sure was work and why shouldnt it be. Put in the hours, enjoy being less than the most amazingly powerful thing in the game.<br />
40 for epic land mount...rofl..yeah 40 sure is pretty epic.<br />
I think the 150% for normal fliers is long overdue, the rest is just overkill.</div></div><hr />

TBH, I think you're looking at the wrong end of the age scale.<br />
<br />
The whole &quot;wah wah wah, I had to pay more for my mount than he did! It's not fair!!&quot; puts me in mind of a screaming 7 year old brat stamping his foot and having a tantrum. It's utterly infantile.<br />
<br />
This change does not make the game easier. Mount speed has no bearing on the difficulty of questing, or running an instance/raid. All it does is reduce the utterly tedious and unproductive travel time that's the main drawback with levelling up.<br />
<br />
If the whiners think it's some kind of challenge to spend 5 minutes instead of 3 minutes riding from A to B, then they're are clueless.</div></div><hr />

And woho mount buffs, tho 1.5 sec might be a nerf for.. druids or other classes that got a travel ability (instant or not) and for arenas lols<br />
And they should make ghost wolf instant as a base ability now then lol, since it will take the same amount of time to mount (w/o the talent) to cast ghost wolf xD</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kila</div><div class="date">2009-06-11, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, because leveling is challenging.<br />
<br />
The level cap is now 80. This game has been about the endgame since TBC came out, and the only leveling content that is relevant is Northrend. The majority of players have at least one 80, and the old world is dead to any new players. The faster we can get people through it, the better.<br />
<br />
The best change imo is 150% regular flyer, which makes epic flight less of a necessity. As someone with two 80s and three more toons waiting at 75-78, I'm thrilled by this. I can bring them all to 80 and only pay 1700g per toon, instead of 7000g per toon.<br />
<br />
I've spent 14000g on my two mains, and i've paid the 1000g for an epic land mount on 3 other toons. This wasn't an accomplishment, it was a dumb money sink spent on something that is completely essential to the current endgame. I'd much rather save some of that money, get to play my alts, AND be able to afford buying nice things for my mains, oh, like a Nobles Deck for my tank's DPS set?<br />
<br />
Oh, and &quot;this makes ganking people in Outland impossible&quot;? Gimme a second while I try to care about whether some sociopathic scrub can ruin someone's day or not.<br />
<br />
Shit, can't do it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wholeheartedly agreed.<br />
<br />
I waited and paid for 60% level 40 mounts, i waited and paid for multiple level 60 100% mounts and i've waiting and paid for multiple normal and epic flying mounts (4 80's, 2 70's). This change will make my alt leveling alot faster and more importantly cheaper, with 150% flying there's no need to buy epic flying on my future alts. <br />
<br />
So yeah, this change is awesome, even if i have spent a fortune in the past i wont have to spend a fortune in the future.</div></div><hr />

/raise! i just clicked the comments because i really enjoy the selfrighteous and egotistical whining all the crybabies like to spew here.<br />

<br />
These changes will completely nulify the Shaman travel form, which they get at lvl. 20. Druid's travel form (lvl. 30 spell) is already almost worthless outside of very short trips or in combat due to lvl. 30 mounts. <br />
<br />
In case Druid specs into feral it is even more stupid as such player can travel faster even earlier in cat form. (lvl. 22)<br />
<br />
Shamans get rather shafted as their &quot;travel&quot; form has 1 sec cast speed. Maybe, due to mount changes in 3.2 they will even reconsider this and make it instant speed? <br />
<br />
Seriously, both Shamans and Druids deserve that their &quot;travel&quot; forms can be taught from trainer way earlier like it is now for Shaman (lvl. 20) or Druid (lvl. 30)!</div></div><hr />

1-20 you are in one or maybe 2 zones. all your quests are rather close....and 1-20 is over in like 2 days. if 1-20 is a major pain in the ass to you...maybe you should look into qh or carbonite. or maybe /wrists and quit the game.</div></div><hr />

It has been like that for ALL aspects of life, real or virtual, since the dawn of time. People crying about change has been going on for just as long. We have people crying about the fact that they already spent X amount of gold on X number of characters. To you I say Good Job! You endured through some of the toughest grinds in WoW. We have people crying about how much easier it is for casuals to get the things that others had to work so hard for. To you I say Get Over It. Blizzard will always do anything it takes to get more people to pay more money to buy and play this game. They are running a business here, everyone still has to pay their 15 dollars a month to play. That's REAL money that you or your mommy and/or daddy have to work a REAL job to get. Then we have people crying about other people crying. To you I say Get Over Yourselves. All this does is put you in the same class as those crying about the changes in the first place. Crying is crying, no matter what it is your crying about. Change is good, people. One thing most people haven't come to terms with is that no matter how much you cry, it won't change anything. Never has, never will. I disagree with things sometimes as well, but I also understand that if there is nothing I can do about it, then there is no reason to cry about it. Blizzard WILL make these changes no matter how much you want them to. That's the bottom line. After a couple of months no one will even care anyway.</div></div><hr />

They have to make everything easier, why they just dont get us every character starting at 80 and having full t7+deadly gear? They managed to change and mess up even tbc times, which i thought that they will stay untouched. damn it :(<br />
<br />
However i welcome this change for myalts on lvl 77-80, because exping in storm peaks or icecrown was pain on slow mounts and fast mounts are riddicolously expensive.(and that is good, that they are expensive.)</div></div><hr />

Also, tell me how the hell making mounts cheaper and available at lower levels is making the game easier? It just makes it faster to level. There is a difference between &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;just plain annoying&quot;. But obviously you &quot;hardcore&quot; people are too full of yourself to understand this! Jerks.<br />
<br />
I welcome the mount changes, because I am an alt-leveler and a man who doesn't enjoy grinding quests and mats for the AH just to get away from the crippled regular flying mounts.<br />
<br />
Anyone who's complaining about the mount changes: you're jerks. And no, you're not getting refunds, because you've &quot;wasted&quot; 1000 gold at most, which is pretty simple to get these days. Or so says the hardcore people, but who knows? They're completely nuts anyways.</div></div><hr />

This is a brilliant change. Complaining about mounts being cheaper than what you bought them for &quot;back in the day&quot; is like saying &quot;I bought my quad-core computer with quad SLI graphics 3 years ago for £2000 and now this guy can buy the same thing today for only £500. Outrageous. They should still have to pay top dollar for outdated hardware. The store should refund me the difference. Murr rage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Notice they haven't lowered epic flying price, apart from the faction discount? In much the same way they haven't lowered the experience needed for 70-80. It'll happen eventually, but only when everyone else has moved on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You realize that giving mount earlier doesn't change the number of quests you have to do or the number of mobs you have to kill? Leveling faster doesn't make you understand your class better. Whether you kill 50 or 1000000 mobs, you may still never learn that sinister strike + eviscerate is not necessarily the most efficient way to do dps in a raid. Now go back in your corner and L2Whine.<br />
<br />
This is a great change and everyone is a winner. Try leveling an alt, and you will understand the daunting task any new players is faced with. The 1-70 zones are completely empty and the running involved is just crazy. Enough to make many players stop before getting into &gt;70 content. It really feels like ghostown, and 300+ hours without seeing anyone in a MMO is sort of a contradiction, really.</div></div><hr />

I guess you don't realize some people don't have the time to play as much as others...let me guess you hate casuals? I agree it is easy to make gold at level 60+ due to the increased money from quests and what not but at early levels you don't get that much gold...unless via you pick up gathering professions and play the AH. I agree though that they should not touch the epic flyer prices but I do believe that lowering the first mount skill at least was good.

How is that the ability to level fast?<br />
<br />
Just levelled my Girlfriend from 1 -65, in this time I haven't been able to get a group together for anything higher the deadmines, Because there has been no healers or tanks about. No matter how long it takes, 2 days or 2 months, if you can't get a group in the lower levels, then you will learn nothing.<br />
<br />
Fact is, the game Starts at level 70 now, that's where the groups are, and the thats where people will learn how there class will interact with other's. The changes to mounts only shortens the route to this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is exactly true. I've levelled a few alts recently, and for none of them have I been able to find groups for anything before northrend. Levels 1-70 are now pretty much entirely solo levels. So getting mounts cheaper and quicker is a welcome change.<br />
<br />
The only thing which annoys me is that over however many characters I've now spent thousands of gold more than I've needed to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nobody is saying they are a problem to do. People are simply saying that they are both sub-30 zones which are very large, and which require large amounts of running. It's not &quot;a problem&quot; to sit with autorun on for 5 minutes as you stroll from one end of the zone to the other, but it certainly is tedious. Having a mount doesn't make the game easier, and doesn't mean you require less quests or less kills to level up. But it does mean you travel between places quicker. And nobody enjoys travelling for ages at running speed, no matter what you say.</div></div><hr />

I dont get it. Ppl want it easier and easier. Why not just start as lvl 70, remove outland all together so new players dont need to install/buy that. Only ppl in vanilla areas cause of AHs and achivements (well some are in exodar cause of lag in other cities ^^)<br />
<br />

<br />
Just levelled my Girlfriend from 1 -65, in this time I haven't been able to get a group together for anything higher the deadmines, Because there has been no healers or tanks about. No matter how long it takes, 2 days or 2 months, if you can't get a group in the lower levels, then you will learn nothing.<br />
<br />
Fact is, the game Starts at level 70 now, that's where the groups are, and the thats where people will learn how there class will interact with other's. The changes to mounts only shortens the route to this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Even if you do find a group for the other low level dungeons (which isn't that hard on any of the servers I level on) it's ridiculous to think that it will teach you anything about group play. Most alts nowadays are fully geared with heirloom items and/or various blues, which means that whoever you group with is going to carry you through even if you're a newbie who's meleeing mobs from the front.<br />
<br />
These dungeons are just a quick run-through with no distinct tactics. And it doesn't change in Northrend either. You can't honestly be surprised that people who know dungeons only as AoEing adds and then nuking a boss will suddenly understand how to dance on Heigan or run away from beams on Kologarn. I admit I miss the good old days of BC when you couldn't finish heroic Shadow Labs for instance with unexperienced group of morons.<br />
<br />
So really, all this change does is make leveling less painful, it doesn't change anything when it comes to player education. And most importantly, it will make classes who usually leveled slower due to no speed enhancement more attractive. Honestly, slowness is the reason I never leveled warrior or paladin. My first class was a druid (feral swiftness at lvl20 and travel form at lvl30) and the only classes I could bear leveling after that was hunter (aspect of cheetah), shaman (spirit wolf) and mage (blink). Leveling my priest was PAINFUL. If this change comes live I might actually level an Alliance priest finally.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I got a 100% ground mount on my main (very, very long ago), traveling on my low lvl. alts become rather extremely slow.<br />
<br />
When player got that epic ground mount perception of speed in game is raised to a new level and traveling on foot become &quot;too slow!<br />
<br />
When people taste &quot;the breeze&quot; of 100% mount the &quot;snail&quot; running pace at low levels becomes a very annoying chore. Even if you like leveling, it becomes rather frustratingly slow if you think how fast you main is. <br />
<br />
For that reason my 2nd alt (was and still) is Shaman (now lvl. 64), who at lvl. 20 get a &quot;travel form&quot;.<br />
<br />
60% running speed = trivializing content? /facepalm<br />
Good luck running in a pack of (equal lvl) mobs with 60% mount with any chance to survive. You will get stomped very quick. <br />
<br />
Sometimes even 100% ground mount can't save your ass (against equal lvl mobs)!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Them's the facts, and this is why the change was made. I think Blizzard does have some numbers about the old world instances and amount of people in them. Usually two or three, one-two level appropriate and one lvl 80. There are barely any groups for old world instances. The content is pretty much dead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If a player seems to have unusually low DPS then that means he doesn't know how to play his character. It has nothing to do with &quot;fast&quot; levelling or cheap mounts. Some people take the time to learn their class and others don't.</div></div><hr />

Why? Because 280% &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 60%. If the normal flying was still at 60%... kinda ok, but at 150% would make a lot of players think twice before wasting 5k gold (without faction discount!) on epic flying for alts (maybe even for mains).<br />
<br />
Even with gathering professions on my alts, I would probably never waste 5k with a normal flying alread at 150% back in the day.<br />
<br />
If they don't want, they could at least boost the epic flying to 300% and the special 310% mounts to something like 330% or 350% to compensate. Maybe even give people the option to unlearn epic flying once on all characters except one (with would be considered your main) on each server you play. :)</div></div><hr />

Go kill Algalon then. Oh wait, you haven't even killed Yogg. Just because you act like things are too easy doesn't mean they are for most raiders. Sure, it's easier than Vanilla, but Ulduar 25 hard modes are definitely a step in the right direction as far as difficulty goes.<br />

I wouldn't consider myself uber rich, but i do make around 2 grand each week. Back in Vanilla and burning crusade, it was quite a mission to get a mount and when you did get it, you had that feeling of epicness. <br />
But i'm not QQing about this post just because of this, because i'm not an elitist jerk or pretend to be. In fact i love this change, because hey, my druid paid full prices for all his mounts but all my other alts can pay way way less and save me alot of money. If all you QQers really prefer it, then pay all your extra thousand golds for your mounts. Blizzard should then implement an idiot button for all you to do it.<br />
<br />
As for another issues i came across, - is the game getting easier? I think back in the days of Vanilla, pve content was indeed very hard, but that was because no classes were balanced. There was very little flexibility back there. Blizzard have since then improved all the classes and have scaled the dungeons. I think Blizzard has taken more of the casual players into consideration, but with the Achievement system, this shows the top players from the casual players who just clear Ulduar and Naxx, and especially with the hard modes in Ulduar and OS too. So is the game getting easier? Yes and No. Sure you'll get to clear more content easier and faster, but to really differentiate yourself and casual players, i do really think those hardmodes/achievements are a show of that.<br />

<br />
Actually, BoA riding skill would be brilliant. Keep the price the way it was, and then a lesser cost (1/10th or so) to unlock it on other characters.<br />
<br />
This means it would still remain a challenge for the fresh players leveling their first character, and it would make it less of an annoyance for those leveling alts, which is probably what the change was for in the first place.<br />

I am sure that every old school player, like myself, can understand the difference between walking and doing a quest, vs the new proposed access to mounts at an earlier stage. Back in the day, it took forever to walk from one end of Azeroth to the other, until you got your first ground mounts. Now leveling an alt is a bit more appealing.

<br />
Char progressing in my book is lvling a char which improves and makes a difference in the game land, not kill x mobs over and over and repeat same quests on different classes which never change.<br />
<br />
In all fairness who cares about a small change to mount lvl/costs and crappy arena with 1.5 cast speeds, a better whine and cry would be about why the quests and char progress in the game hasn't changed in 4 years (bar 2-3 starter lvls in the death knight questline and wrathgate)<br />
<br />
Looking at other mmo's and i see star wars : tor tho a sci-fi mmo has something which wow really needs instead of a repeat grind every 2 years, that is class focused storylined progress which what you do changes what happens and your char progress.<br />
<br />
3.2 imo more important then icecrown 3.3 as we know what to expect with ashbringer and arthus/lich king, 3.2 i hope isn't going to be x amount daily grind for months on end and only argent tour arena as new content plus a new bg.<br />
<br />
At least outland end game had some good heroics,raids and armour sets, not the crappy recoloured season 5-6 sets that look like something from a 90s rpg, and teir sets which are nothing but copys from lore chars ingame i.e mage,death knight and warlock sets.</div></div><hr />

Farming gold had never, i repeat, never anything to do with skill, it just showed how much effort you did put in the game. (and the 1000 gold in vanilla before the gold for quests done at max level change were a pain.) I guess no whiner did get the vanilla 1000 g pre this chance. Cry more.

<br />
Yes, because having a mount makes me kill things faster. Totally. When I'm fighting something, my mount comes out to help...this is solid fact... ::)<br />
<br />
Face it! The mount change doesn't change the difficulty of the game at all. It changes the travel time. <br />
Let me give you an example, because I think you might be confused. School isn't easier if you're right next door to the school while another person is a mile away. It's just more convenient for the person right next door to the school. The school doesn't change the courses and they won't change the testing to make it easier for the person who's right next door.<br />
<br />
It's a factor of convenience, not a factor of ease. The sooner you figure that out, the better.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Revak</div><div class="date">2009-06-11, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like this change. I have a 40 mage, 41 hunter, and 43 warlock that I may start leveling again after 3.2. It would be nice if they would make the lock, pally, and druid specific mounts/forms available at 40 as well. Maybe trainable but VERY expensive and then cheap at 61 or you can do the quests at 60 as before.<br />
<br />
I have 4 level 80's and a 70 currently that ALL have epic flight and the druid and pally both did the quests for their class mount/form. I've spent a lot of gold on these toons for mounts and it doesn't bother me one bit that they are making this change. End game gets boring so this might encourage me to work on those alts. Running around Tanaris, Un'Goro, Witnerspring, and Silithus doesn't seem so bad if I'm on a level 60 mount at 40 :)<br />
<br />
I also like the change to the normal flyer. I've taken 5 toons through Outland. Being able to fly and do these quests sounds good to me. Plus the normal flyer is faster so I won't feel the need to &quot;have&quot; to buy another 5k flyer with these alts.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Going casual&quot;? As in &quot;it's not right now&quot;? It amazes me how often people forget that WoW became so popular because, from it's beginning, it was the casual MMO. It had a MUCH faster leveling pace than previous MMOs and lots of solo content so ANYBODY could jump on for any amount of time and make progress. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What World of Warcraft was is dieing slowly, and I hate it, WoW is now becoming the game for everyone because blizz knows they can turn a profit. <br />
<br />
Again, always has been &quot;the game for everyone&quot;.<br />
<br />
Another &quot;back in the the good old days&quot; wall of text. <br />
<br />
And again I say:<br />
1) If you don't like it, play something else.<br />
2) WoW has ALWAYS been, and marketed itself as, the casual MMO.<br />
3) Lastly, to keep players (and hence to keep making money, which is an unfortunate necessity of any business), they have to keep giving players things to do. This will make leveling alts much more enticing to players such as myself.<br />
<br />
And so you know where I'm coming from: I've saved up and bought epic flying for 2 toons, and regular flying for 1 more (I also saved up and gave a friend 2500g toward his epic flyer). AND I bought an epic land mount for my druid pre-BC when it was 800g (after faction and pvp rank discount) and there was no island full of daily quests handing out free gold. That's a grand total of almost 14000g just for training/mounts for those toons. I've grinded for weeks to get cash for mounts, and I don't begrudge these changes at all. This was bound to happen eventually, and anyone who has been playing this game for any length of time and is still surprised has very bad pattern recognition.<br />
<br />
Things change. Quit yer whining and be glad, as I am, that you won't have to blow tons of gold on mounts for your alts. And take pride that you worked hard for what you have.<br />

However I cannot wait that long for the next patch with flying mount on my lvl 76 alt. But a bit gold is not important. Very nice change for the people who want to lvl from 1 or who will start playing WoW.</div></div><hr />

I find it funny how so many people look down upon new, and casual players. Get it in your thick skull that the huge numbers that Blizzard does is made up mostly of casual people. Without that money Blizzard wouldn't be able to put all of the time into creating the new content we all enjoy.<br />
<br />
I have leveled 3 toons to 80. And I started playing in open Beta. But who cares. Games evolve. I will happily level up my low-level alts now that I won't have to run around on foot anymore.<br />
<br />
Anyone who looks down on someone who is new or just started playing a video game is a massive tool anyways, and should probably stick a shotgun in their mouth, and pull the trigger with their toe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they are so concerned about their 'hardcore' tag, they should go and play Lineage 2 or Final Fantasy Online, then we can all marvel at how hardcore and leet they are.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eversor</div><div class="date">2009-06-11, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I honestly puke over all these noobs /cheer'ing Blizzard like damn scrubs because they just changed level'ing to something 10 time easier.. But then again, I guess that's what keeps WoW alive, all these casual noobs thinking they're good with their 10 characters now since it's so easy..<br />

I bet you are so hardcore that you don't use zeppelins and ships too, but swim from continent to continent, eh? You are so hardcore that instead of running, you walk everywhere. So hardcore that you walljump to places where normal people would use a flying mount, eh?<br />
<br />
Jesus Christ, we are talking about fucking mounts here. This isn't Olympics and having a mount faster or later does not make you &quot;pro&quot; or &quot;noob&quot;. I don't see how obtaining a mount faster will suddenly allow me to do over 9000 dps in Ulduar and down Algalon with my middle finger. But I guess it is &quot;hardcore&quot; to be that rebel, huh?</div></div><hr />

You mean the part where I tried flipping one of the Hellfire Peninsula towers at level 62 only to be one-shotted by a level 80 paladin who literally dropped on top of me? That kind of fun? Yeah, I'll pass.</div></div><hr />
