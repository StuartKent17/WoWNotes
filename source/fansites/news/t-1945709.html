Warcraft Movie Rewards<br />
A user on Reddit shared a survey (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/44344q/just_got_a_survey_from_blizzard_this_is_a_great/cznzitt) that went out about the Warcraft movie. It mentioned an offer that would reward anyone who purchased a ticket with a copy of all expansions through Warlords of Draenor, one month of game time, and an in-game item. What kind of item would you like to receive? <br />

Helmets Temporarily Hidden In Legion Alpha<br />
Hello everyone! We wanted to give you a quick heads-up on a temporary change in the current Alpha build that could use a little extra context, to avoid confusion.<br />
<br />
Our art team is currently working on some updates to the way helmets are shown in the game, which will ultimately make them look a lot nicer on the high-definition models released with Warlords of Draenor. That work is still in progress, and as a result, head-slot items are in varying stages of work-in-progress. In order to keep things looking sensible – and avoid generating a whole lot of unnecessary bug reports – we’ve hidden that slot from displaying on all characters temporarily while our artists put their finishing touches on things.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your patience!<br />
<br />

Sylvanas Armor Changes<br />
I think you're misusing the word &quot;Censored&quot; here for one. For another, I personally love her look. I like knowing she has on armor that may actually protect her from the battle she's digging herself into. She's a strong character (to me) no matter what she wears. I'd think if I were her, I'd want a change of outfit now and then too.<br />
<br />
Characters evolve and change. Their armor and outfits are going to change. Thrall is just one example of how what he wore was a reflection of the changes he went through. Other characters are bound to see evolutions and changes as they make sense both in their visual representation and in their stories.<br />
<br />
These types of discussions while generally welcome when kept clean, are often just minefields for some inappropriate discussions. I'd like to please caution everyone to not get into the quagmire that results in personal attacks or mud slinging. Art is subjective and what one person interprets something to mean or be may not be what someone else interprets something to be. What one person likes, may not be what someone else likes. That's OK. Just remember that there's no place here for venom toward anyone for those likes or dislikes.<br />
<br />
Can't help but think that the change was made from the pressure I mean you've tried to make it official in hots and ended badly when people complained about it on the forums now you do it instantly without showing preview or anything<br />
I think people have a stilted point of view on what they see as &quot;pressure&quot;. Things change. Times change. The balance between male and female players in WoW is actually much closer than you think and has been for a long while. The topic of what women like or don't like, or play, or have done in the past isn't cut and dry either. I've been playing games (and liking &quot;geek&quot; things) since I first played the Atari as a little girl. I like PvP and blowing things up. Other women may not. Some women like their character to look 'practical'. Others have a different 'fantasy' of what their character should be like. I would never claim to represent &quot;all women&quot; that would be preposterous. <br />
<br />
The same can be said for men. You can't paint everyone with the same brush. It just doesn't work. This is a more complex issue than what should be on these forums. We're getting into dangerous territory here and I've already had to remove some pretty disparaging remarks aimed at others. This community is smarter than that.<br />
<br />
Perceptions of what is and isn't over the years have always baffled me. It seems to go in waves. Each new generation believes fervently that it is or was different for them or has changed 'over the years'. Perception is an amazing thing. It's your perception that this and all other related changes are because of 'x'. Could that be a part of it? Sure. Nothing is being taken away from you or the character with this change. If this was an awards show, you'd be asking her who she's wearing rather than, what she plans to do when she faces the Legion with her people. I have a feeling she plans to lay some smack down.<br />
<br />
*I'd like to advise people not to give 'parenting advice' here for Mr. Metzen or anyone else. Again, this isn't appropriate. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/400797-why-did-they-censored-sylvanas/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20741914028?page=10#188))<br />

Returning Player<br />
Welcome back! I'm sure you just ran into the types that assume you must/have to know it all already. It makes returning a bit rough at first when you run into them first out of the gate. I have no doubt you'll get back in the swing of things quickly and find some people (starting here maybe?) who would be happy to help you get up to speed.<br />
<br />
That's a good generic dev post for a game where the community is more toxic than ever. I don't have suggestions to make it better, but the community is bad.<br />
I disagree with the statement of &quot;more toxic than ever&quot; but I don't want this thread to turn into that. There are some really great people in the community, many of whom (as I mentioned in my post) would love to help a returning player out. You just have to be open to it and not let the 'bad apples' spoil the whole barrel for you.

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
I stopped playing World of Warcraft due to the LFR/LFD feature that you implemented. It took away the atmosphere and server communities died following X-realms and phasing. What was your reasoning behind this rather than merging servers as many rather wanted? My name was't THAT unique. <br />
The features you're talking about were implemented to give players an option to run content besides just sitting around spamming chat when their friends weren't online. I have always had a huge guild in WoW, and I still remember spamming chat for groups -- and I was a tank!<br />
<br />
Cross-realm was more targeted and solving the problem of realm population disparity. The concept of a realm has been pretty integral to the game for a long time. It was important to get to know the folks on your realm. That changed for a lot of reasons -- realm transfers, leveling becoming more easily, and the age of the game just to name a few.<br />

You're correct. However,<br />

Although it's always a good idea to be wary of phishing attempts, I wanted to drop in to let you know that this survey is legitimate.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That's really fishy that you guys have misspelt Lich though. You should maybe send an e-mail out telling people that it was a mistake and not to panic or something?<br />
I'm not sure if a correction email has been sent (good feedback), but I do know that the typo has since been corrected for subsequent mailings.

It makes a lot of sense. Sylvanas was getting arrogant, no longer hiding in the shadows to do her bidding but actually showing herself on the battlefield. She acted as if she was invincible. Her arrogance cost her a life. Right after Crowley surrendered to her and agreed to leave Gilneas, Lord Godfrey turned on her and shot her. One of her Val'kyr sacrificed itself to revive her. It makes perfect sense for Sylvanas to suddenly protect herself in any way she can, and a logical first step would be not wearing a bikini top on the front-lines.</div></div><hr />

Uhm, pretty sure you misunderstood the intent: The purpose is obviously to recruit new players to the game from amongst viewers of the movie, not mainly the other way around. Hence the emphasis on free game play and starter kit. Which totally makes sense.</div></div><hr />

You narrative is clearly showing, ridiculous male armor and or proportions is as usual completely fine but because there's hints of female sexualization it should be changed because its soooo outrageous. This is why these complaints are never taken seriously, and I mean I could go on to say that there's females IRL who have the same body compositions as some of the female models in the game, but I guess that would be oppressive. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Wasn't even a discussion about armor really. Male characters are equally sexualized as female ones, maybe even more so considering the amount of 'tribal' orc and troll leaders. <br />

Are you serious? The discussion was entirely about armor.<br />

<br />
The person I replied to was talking about the physical proportions for female characters, not their armor. <br />
<br />
Also for your benefit I''ll post one of the definitions of sexualization.<br />
<br />
&quot;a person is held to a standard that equates physical attractiveness (narrowly defined) with being sexy;&quot;'<br />
<br />
Last I checked muscular, large men was one of the more common types of male physical attractiveness (being sexy). And lets take a quick look at the kalimdor loading screen shall we? Oh, look at that, 3 of the 5 males there are near enough bare chested, overly muscular and large. By the very definition of the word these characters would, by your own logic really assuming you know to use the word correctly, be sexualized. <br />
<br />
So no, they don't have to look like Kuja at all, that's just your own standard for male sexualization and you're entitled to that opinion of course. However at the end of the day that's just what it is, your opinion. Clamoring for the remodeling of female characters would by the same logic require them to remodel the male ones. Unless its not equality you want which is unfortunately more often than not the case these days.</div></div><hr />

She's in a war. Against very big demons. Leaving your entire mid-riff open is just a bad idea for someone fighting. I thought the same thing for Garrosh always running around without any armor, its stupid.<br />

It just amuses me, and kills another little piece of my soul that in 2016 there's an uproar over covering a video game character's boobs. <br />

Some guys just want to be surrounded by boobs 24/7. It's infantile, it's beyond sexist, it's obsessive (Wha? Video gamers, obsessive? That's crazy talk!), and it's a fight I gave up on years ago, you can't win, as pathetic and sad as it is.</div></div><hr />

Your argument would have more merit if the preponderance of female characters in video games and video game culture were represented in more natural, life like ways. When the over-sexualization of female characters is at 10,000, it's not irrational to want it scaled back some. The females in WoW run around with basketballs on their chests, and it's dumb - and I've seen enough comments over the years for wanting them to be BIGGER to know it's intentional, and 100% fan service. Want to get boys to buy a video game? Strap some basketballs onto a females chest - they'll buy in droves. (Never mind the fact that no living human female is proportioned like a WoW character, unless she's spent quite a bit at the plastic surgeon's) Hell, the over-sexualization is applied to non humans in the game - if it's female - 38HHH boobs. Except for gnomes. Whoever designed them showed some class and taste. <br />
<br />

Again, putting words in my mouth. I never said it was outrageous or that I was offended in anyway. I said the whole thing was hilarious and laughable. If blizzard wants to dress major lore characters in pure fan service, that is their prerogative. You wont find me outside picketing or even making my own thread about it. But don't expect me to have any respect for these characters or to take them seriously as warriors or leaders. <br />
<br />
Also, I wouldn't be opposed to blizzard also redoing the males. Varian Wynns proportions and facial expressions are laughable as well. I remember when the preview for male blood elves came out, and they were much more lithe and slim. People outraged because they weren't &quot;buff&quot; like human males and orcs. So, it goes both ways. <br />

You're the one who decided to only bring up the female characters, not me. If you'd made clear you were of the opinion that both male and female characters needs to be reworked from the get-go then there wouldn't have been a conclusion like that. <br />
<br />
Y'know, something like &quot;I think WoW characters are dis-proportioned and should be changed.&quot; Which is fair enough, instead you singled out the female ones as if they're the only ones suffering this problem. Which is a common narrative and agenda of, as you called them, 'tumblrinas'.</div></div><hr />

Here's the thing, when I share my opinion about such a silly topic, I don't step onto my soapbox to preach about every variable because it just doesn't really matter. I simply say how I feel about the topic at hand, which was Sylvanas' new armor. In my orginal post I was merely making a point that putting more clothes on her was nonsensical because of her ridiculously over-sized fun bags. Basically, the change, in my eyes did next to nothing to de-sexualize her if that was the intended goal. Sylvanas happens to look exactly the same from the neck down as every other major lore character which is why I chose to comment about the models as a group. You chose to make this into a bigger issue than it actual was. Besides, I'm not going to play this game with you. There is no denying that female characters are much more sexualized than the male ones are. The differences in the same piece of armor based on which gender displays it is proof enough of that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah, and so the truth comes out at last. Have you considered that so-called 'slutwear' (which is what you're referring to here) looks different on different genders because it simply suits one gender better than the other? A plate bikini on men wouldn't make sense because men don't wear bikinis, hence why their chests are exposed instead. Then of course you can argue the merit of a plate-bikini to begin with, which I too would agree is stupid but fortunately its a video game and I don't see a reason to get offended by pixels.<br />
<br />
I also didn't realize debating an issue you yourself just brought up was &quot;playing a game&quot;. If that's how you see people who has an opposition to your opinions then you shouldn't be posting them on the internet.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, people. Can't we just admit that whether you're male, female, or whatever the hell you define yourself as, we all like looking at things that get our procreation motors running? And it just so happens that, for the majority of people in western culture, that is women with giant t and a, and dudes with six-packs and barrel chests. It's human nature. If realism versus fantasy gets your undies in a bunch, you really need to reconsider your approach to life. Chill out and try to enjoy things for once!

<br />
It may be the free month is only for those who activate the included battlechest? And current players only get the in-game item?<br />
<br />
Even if not, it's more like this:<br />
<br />
1 - People who are already subscribed can get a free month for watching the movie, which isn't huge considering they'll probably remain subbed either way. Which means: They increase player happyness of a lot of people who were going to watch the movie either way.<br />
<br />
2 - People who own the game but are not subscribed get a free month which can help getting them back subscribing.<br />
<br />
3 - They bring in players who already had the game but might've be on the edge on watching or not the movie, and they overall increase box office sales (which will also help determining wether there's sequels or not).<br />
<br />
4 - They increase the value of the ticket (free game with the ticket, FIVE expansions AND 1 free month of subscription, wow :D) for non-current players.<br />
<br />
5 - Depending on how it's done, it may allow current players to give their battlechest codes to friends who don't own the game yet.<br />
<br />
TL;DR: They lose a bit of profit, but in the long run they set everything up to increase official box office profits and number of people watching the movie and playing the game. Which will also help selling Legion boxes which will come &quot;soon(tm)&quot; after the movie, chances are =P<br />
<br />
It's pretty genius actually =P<br />
<br />
But oh well, people get stuff for free and still gotta complain &lt;_&lt;</div></div><hr />

Covering her mid section doesn't change the fact that her breasts are hilariously large and part like the red sea when she breathes.<br />
<br />
People who have an issue with the female models in WoW but do not say a word about the male models are completely ignored by me. It is a hipster, generic and lazy Social Justice Warrior stunt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at me! Changing the world. I do not like what most people consider sexy so I demand anything that looks like it, CHANGE!&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course these armies of world changers can never seem to get off their butts to design their own games with these models. Like most of their ilk, they want OTHER people to do it for them.</div></div><hr />

Am I not the only person who thinks this is the smart thing to do, and as a business/businessman I would do the exact same thing, I mean you've spent years on a film based of a your game, people from all over will come to watch it. now they've just watched this amazing film and want more and have been gifted the game? what do you think they go do immediately after, you go install the game and try it out and at no loss to yourself as this was included in the film, smarten up people if anything this may temporarily bring a bit of life back to wow.</div></div><hr />

What about the high heels every female character in blizzard games wears? They are sure hell o' good shoes for combat. It's just stupid to just think about anything but pc in that matter.<br />
<br />
Completely agree with you - if this was done for the reasons I believe it was done; the floodgates are now open. On the other hand Blizzard is covering it pretty well even though I think we can all agree that her new armor offers very little 'extra' protection - it's still skintight leather etc; but hey lets not consider realism even though thats the point thats being argued in a fantasy game.</div></div><hr />

And what exactly is bad about fan service? If you dont like the look of Sylvanas, maybe move on with your A-sexual world view and chose Jaina as your fav Hero character.</div></div><hr />

Aren't most movie tickets under the cost of a month of gametime? Are we being bribed to see their movie? Is the movie that bad that they have to bribe their own niche market to see it?<br />
<br />
By all logic, the free month is coming with the new account they are giving you, and not to your current account.<br />
<br />
Basically it's a recruit-a-friend thing. Bring players to the movie and bring movie goers to the game.<br />
<br />
It was to be expected of course. Just putting a unique mount in there would bring apparently 200k players.<br />
<br />
Now, make it BOE and people will buy tickets just to resell the mount lol.</div></div><hr />

A whole new game with all expansions for a ticket. That is really saying &quot;wow is cheap&quot;. Very disappointing move.<br />
It would be better if with every ticket you got a referral code and send it to a friend , similar to recruit a friend, where your friend would get the game/expansion AND legion at 50% of the price with 1 month free. After all you get a 100lvl boost with the account.. Who cares about sylvanas.. sigh!<br />
<br />
The trailers published show a shaman doing a chain lightning from a mountain or thunderstorm something. I like that.<br />
The emo part is too emo and the human voices are really &quot;young&quot; compared to how heavy they should have been for an epic human vs orc story.<br />
I think orcs are way too huge compared to humans inside the movie :(<br />
CGI is awesome, the face of the orc is 4k detail ! :)<br />
Cant wait for the movie, if its bad or not i dont care. This wil lbe the only thing from blizzard in 10+ years that i will buy (ticket) that isnt an actual game or expansion or subscription (never bought mounts and stuff)</div></div><hr />

It's cross promoting inviting new players to the game right before Legion comes out a month or 2 later. It's win/win. Promotes the film and Legion at the same time. They'll also show the trailer to Legion before the film. <br />
<br />
The chain lightning at the top of the mountain is from Nerzhul, the lich king before he's the lich king. There's leaked footage of him and Lothar fighting atop the mountain. At the end of the tv spot you see Lothar flying away on a gryphon right before the huge chain lightning.<br />

<br />
It's funny, until I saw this and thought about it, I hadn't realized that a majority of the end bosses of expansions are Dudes with No Shirts;<br />
<br />
-Burning Crusade: Illidan (has tattoos for a shirt),<br />
-Mists of Pandaria: Garrosh Hellscream (Has... tusks for a shirt?),<br />
-Warlords of Dreanor: Archimonde (Has shoulderpads for a shirt).<br />
<br />
Unless I am misremembering, the only expansion boss in WoW history that wore a shirt was the Lich King.</div></div><hr />

I'm assuming the orc in the shaman gear is Nerzhul because who else could cast such a massive chain lightning besides him? He was the greatest shaman at that time. The lich king remember, was a shaman before. I'm thinking this is foreshadowing who he will become(the Lich king) and possessing Arthas.</div></div><hr />

I thought about that, but having never finished the Dragonsoul raids I didn't know: does he actually appear in human form durring the raids? If so... well, it's still a majority skins, but slightly less one-sided.</div></div><hr />

Nope. He's just a dragon and a weird, melty tentacle monster in the raid. The only <br />
time he uses his human form is during the &quot;I'm gonna punch tha' dragon in the face!&quot; <br />
quest series.</div></div><hr />

How is wanting to look good a stupid fantasy? I mean, you are in a game with tanks, planes, Gatling guns, cross bows, if it was real life<br />
armor would have no use at all, actually a bikini and some green bodypaint would be WAY better than a glowing silver tin can if you were getting shot at by guns.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So exposing more of your body is a sure fire way to lessen the chance of a bullet doing serious/fatal damage or even just a small wound for that matter? Also what if you are in a situation where camo/bodypaint is completely worthless? Even more exposure risk.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sitting in a glowing silver can is a surefire way to get shot at, so yes, not sitting in one would be better, guess why we don't wear armor in combat currently, instead we wear pants and a shirt, maybe a vest for shrapnel if in a serious army (AK bullets go through it though).</div></div><hr />

I know a ton of people that play WoW and almost all of them said they won't be seeing it. Saying things like it looks cheesy. I won't be either and I'm 13/13 mythic with alpha access. If some people that play the game won't be going to see it, how many people that don't do you think will? This will be an embarrassing flop. I don't even have to bookmark this and rub it in later cause it's a certainty.</div></div><hr />
