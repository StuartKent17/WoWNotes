IRVINE, Calif., Aug 17, 2010 -- Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. today announced plans for a limited-release Collector's Edition of World of Warcraft(R): Cataclysm(TM), the third expansion for the world's most popular subscription-based massively multiplayer online role-playing game,* World of Warcraft. The special Collector's Edition package, which will only be available at retail stores, will include the following exclusive bonus items in addition to the game disc:<br />
<br />
-- Art of the Cataclysm art book, featuring 176 pages of never-before-seen images from the archives of the Blizzard Entertainment cinematics department and the World of Warcraft development team, as well as progressive visuals from multiple stages of development.<br />
<br />
-- Exclusive in-game pet: he may not be a breaker of worlds just yet, but Lil' Deathwing will still proudly accompany heroes on their struggle to save Azeroth from his much, much larger counterpart.<br />
<br />
-- Behind-the-scenes DVD with over an hour of developer interviews and commentaries, as well as a special Warcraft(R) retrospective examining the rich gaming history of the Warcraft universe.<br />
<br />
-- Soundtrack featuring 10 epic new tracks from Cataclysm, including exclusive bonus tracks.<br />
<br />
-- Special-edition mouse pad depicting Deathwing menacing the ravaged continents of Azeroth.<br />
<br />
-- World of Warcraft Trading Card Game cards, including a 60-card starter deck from the Wrathgate series, two extended-art cards, and two Collector's Edition-exclusive hero cards, marking the first appearance of goblin and worgen heroes in the TCG.<br />
<br />
The first two World of Warcraft expansions, The Burning Crusade(R) and Wrath of the Lich King(R), each shattered PC game sales records upon their release. In Cataclysm, the face of Azeroth will be forever altered by the return of the corrupted Dragon Aspect Deathwing. Players will explore once-familiar areas of the world that have now been reshaped by the devastation and filled with new adventures. In an effort to survive the planet-shattering cataclysm, two new playable races -- worgen and goblins -- will join the struggle between the Alliance and the Horde. As players journey to the new level cap of 85, they'll discover newly revealed locations, acquire new levels of power, and come face to face with Deathwing in a battle to determine the fate of the world.<br />
<br />
The beta test for World of Warcraft: Cataclysm is currently underway. To set up a Battle.net account and sign up for a chance to participate, please visit the official Battle.net website at http://www.battle.net.<br />
<br />
The World of Warcraft: Cataclysm Collector's Edition will be available on DVD-ROM for Windows(R) XP/Windows Vista(R)/Windows(R) 7 and Macintosh(R) at a suggested retail price of $79.99. The release date and other details for the game will be announced in the months ahead. For more information on World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, please visit the official website at http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/cataclysm. <br />
<br />
Lil'Deathwing (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/87344/) is confirmed as the collector pet.<br />

<br />
They did with the preorders for at least one of the other CEs - I believe it was BC. They took them off the websites for a day, and when they came back up, there was a limit of two or three.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I doubt they will release in october, too many zones havent been tested and they will probably atleast need another 3 months or so to fully test the rest. (Since it looks like uldum/highlands are coming pretty soon)</div></div><hr />

<br />
i actually love collecting pets and i would like to get my hands on this mini deathwing but man...$80 x2 for me (my wife also plays) i just cant justify spending that much money when i couldnt care less for art books after i look through them a few times.<br />
<br />
either way im not gonna say its bad to get it for those who want it but im happy with just the expansion.<br />
<br />
i still feel a late november release just in time for holiday season and isnt that when most of their games get released?</div></div><hr />

I'll kinda be glad if it comes out late november, early december honestly, i think some other people would agree as well if their currently in college or school. Less distraction from finals and leaves all Winter break to play it up ^_^!</div></div><hr />

They said it will be released in Q4, and I still believe they said they will release it before Blizzcon. So the only time possible would be before late Oct. Also I doubt they will make us wait another 4 months for the expansion. I am willing to bet that the Pre-Cata events happen next month and once they end: CATACLYSM!<br />
<br />
Also, a normal new video game is around 60 bucks, I do not care if this is an expansion, I will still call it WoW 2.0 because in my eyes it is. So an extra 20 bucks for all of those extras does NOT seem bad at all. I can go with just eating Ramen for a week :D</div></div><hr />

and when that hits, it will be huge, so you wont miss it<br />
<br />
My take is since they pushed blizzcon back later this year, we will see them announce the release date there, for something like a month later, which would be the endish of november, and immediately following Blizzcon the 3.9 bridge path will launch. Thats just my guess tho.</div></div><hr />

If you look on the image on whats inside the Collector's Edition the minipet on the picture looks like some kind of fiery frostwyrm whelp. (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/cataclysm/_images/features/collector/backplate_large.jpg)<br />
<br />
However just saying that makes me believe they slacked and just did a repaint on the image they had from Wrath of the Lich King since all those pictures on whats inside the Collector's Edition are almost the same on everyone of them :P<br />
<br />
I however believe they should have added what they had in the Vanilla Collector's Edition, a cloth map of Azeroth (on one side and Outland on other) seeing how it is getting changed now and also the cloth map should be bigger so you can see more detail &lt;3</div></div><hr />

If you were as involved in pet collecting as some people are (see warcraftpets.com) you'd understand a lot of people really don't care about any of the physical items which come with the collector's edition, I'm speaking for myself here really though heh...</div></div><hr />

I kind of doubt this will happen, thats 1 week before Blizzcon. Another thing to note is that they gave the Wrath release date the same day they gave the collector's edition info. I remember them releasing CE info andd wowhead.com and worldofwarcraft.com said &quot;In stores, 11.13.08&quot; On some big banner.</div></div><hr />

Truly i cant say your estimation is right, i dont know blizzard that much - i like to keep attitude &quot;when its ready&quot;. But with 3.9 you can freak out, becouse that is the time when Cata comes really soon(tm), which was point of my previous comment. I would guess that majority of 3.9 event was already deployed on servers (with those 24h+ maintance gaps) and only some fine tunning is done for that. Also beta testing is finalizing pretty quickly, at least with dmg/hp ratio being tuned up to match real servers and provide expierience that will be brought with 4.0 patch.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Unfortunately, the release date for the item(s) listed below was changed by the supplier, and we need to provide you with a new estimated delivery date based on the new release date:<br />
<br />
Christie Golden &quot;World of Warcraft: The Shattering: Prelude to Cataclysm&quot;<br />
Estimated arrival date: October 22 2010&quot;<br />
<br />
So, assuming that they don't want the book to come out too soon before Cataclysm, that points to Cataclysm coming out at the end of October at the earliest. Tenuous? You bet. :) But I like conjecturing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dawnseven</div><div class="date">2010-08-18, 12:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My take is since they pushed blizzcon back later this year, we will see them announce the release date there, for something like a month later, which would be the endish of november, and immediately following Blizzcon the 3.9 bridge path will launch. Thats just my guess tho.<br />
<br />
They didn't push it back though. It alternates. <br />
<br />
Blizzcon '05 - was Oct<br />
Blizzcon '07 - was Aug<br />
Blizzcon '08 - was Oct<br />
Blizzcon '09 - was Aug</div></div><hr />

That or spend $5 on one at Walmart hehe.<br />
<br />
Personally I dont get the point of CE for this game, Id rather use that extra money on game time. To each their own though.</div></div><hr />

You sir are an idiot. How is this expansion at all like the other two? I mean if you can answer me that, then maybe I'll believe you. Any who, I'm glad you won't be around we don't need debbie downers like you playing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buzzinjoe</div><div class="date">2010-08-18, 05:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Considering how terrible the ambient noise filler (I'm sorry, 'music') is in Blizzard games and in WoW especially, I'd be embarrassed to have that as a bullet selling point.<br />
<br />
Music in the game has been pretty good and fitting for the zones so far. Some of it was better than other bits of course.<br />
<br />
Claiming it is terrible is just plain wrong. You may not like it, but artistically it is actually very good and mostly fitting.<br />
<br />
Go through BT with the music on and tell me again that it is terrible. BT has some of the best suited tracks for each section.</div></div><hr />

Also, I hope it's a November release. I work in a costume store, and Halloween is our biggest season. If it's released in October, no way I get realm's first priest to 85!</div></div><hr />

If you compare it to the games like Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, Halo: Reach and Gran Turismo 5 which their CE were much more appealing.<br />
<br />
I'm actually quite impressed by the Starcraft 2 CE, which is my first Blizz CE. For forty dollars extra you get the orginal game and xpac (20 bucks on its own) installed on a 2GB usb drive you could knock someone out with on top of the usual stuff (artbook, CD, dvd). Plus the coolest wow pet to date. Oh, and a really badass box. Seriously. I'll admit WoW CEs kind of lack appeal if you are not into extras...normally I'm not but I'm going to give this one a try, because at least the SC2 extras seem to be good quality.</div></div><hr />

<br />
$80 for this now, with a 10-track OST (why only 10?), another worthless mousepad, a cool art book, and then the biggest slap in the face to WoW fans: The Pet. Yes, let's give SC2 buyers a much cooler pet than the CE for the WoW expansion itself. They recycled the damn animations and such from the whelps/frostwyrm and slapped a little different looking model on that. That is an insult to WoW fans everywhere.<br />

This is going too far, I will NOT be purchasing this rip off of a CE. I have purchased the others, but this is the first I'll pass on. Also, this pales in comparison to other games. Heck, even SC2's was so much better. Not to mention things like Gran Turismo 5's CE/LE that absolutely blow this away for similar money.<br />

It's a CE announcement, not a release date. What exactly do you want people to comment on here? We've seen this exact announcement for WotLK with the exact same CE content. Do you want everyone to post &quot;Yes I'm getting it&quot; or &quot;I'm not going to bother&quot;?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ummm. No. Blizzad have never included an authenticator with any of their games as of yet. It would have been nice of them to include one starting with this release since they are so keen on suggesting players buy one whenever their accounts get hacked.<br />
<br />
I'll still get it, it would have added value is all.</div></div><hr />
