Patch 4.3 - Priest Glyph of Shadow<br />
Priests are getting a new minor Glyph in patch 4.3, the Glyph of Shadow (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/77101/glyph-of-shadow/)! As mentioned during Blizzcon, this glyph changes the alpha of your character and lets you see most of your equipment while in Shadow Form.<br />
<br />

<br />
So many people can't see the difference between the old and new Aegis. Here is the old: <br />
<br />
Note: Yes, this is triggered off a bug. But that is the OLD Spell Effect regardless.<br />
<br />
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7z5odb8SY0<br />
<br />
Main difference: <br />
<br />
New - Just the original after-bubble that pops up<br />
Old - Wicked animation that leads up to the bubble with added border effect on the actual bubble</div></div><hr />

<br />
The old one had more of an animation before the bubble appeared. This one, well... kinda just pops up and looks just like the original Aegis bubble. Less of a flashy animation into the bubble though.<br />
<br />
Here's a good look at the old Aegis.<br />

<br />
Because of transmogrification, which otherwise would be rather wasted on a shadow priest.<br />
What would be the point of using a feature if you other people cannot easily see the result.<br />
<br />
While the region tracking on the minimap is a useful addition for many, it is again a feature blizzard are ripping off from a 3rd party addon.<br />
It also at least in the current blizzard implementation seems to be extending beyond the boundary of the visible map, though I would hope that would be fixed later.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, where did Blizzard say you are FORCED to use this glyph?<br />
<br />
No. It's a player's decision.<br />
<br />
Don't like the visual of the current Shadowform? You have the choice of remaking it.<br />

No one is forcing anyone in game :)<br />

<br />
shadowfiend glyph is next to pointless, how often does it die to damage? rarely ever, it's actually not worth glyphing imo</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Railander</div><div class="date">2011-10-30, 09:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Definitely. Fade's mana cost is just way too much.<br />
thats not his point.<br />
he means that he'd always prefer something that actually change numbers rather than something that purely changes visuals.<br />
but, anyway, shadowfiend glyph is pretty much worse than a cosmetic glyph. seriously, when was the last time your shadowfiend was killed?</div></div><hr />

I dont raid. Shackle Undead for DK Pets.<br />
<br />
Maybe you dont like my choices on minor glyphs, but that doesent change the fact that i shouldnt have to lose a glyph to be able to see my character better. That makes no sense to me.</div></div><hr />

Maybe you dont like my choices on minor glyphs, but that doesent change the fact that i shouldnt have to lose a glyph to be able to see my character better. That makes no sense to me.<br />
couldnt agree more, and blizzard has proven to agree on that philosophy too with the talent changes to 5.0. you shouldnt ask players to chooce between 2 dinstinc things. in case you dont understand me, its like if there were both healing and dps talents within the same dps/heal talent tree. the choice would be a no brainer if the player wants to focus in just one of those.</div></div><hr />

Why would a class be forced to give up a useful glyph for a visual change??<br />

Shadowfiend is pretty much a wasted glyph slot honestly - unless you are PVP'ing and some idiot is targeting your shadowfiend - your shadowfiend isn't going to typically die to damage, since they buffed their aoe resistance.</div></div><hr />

how could we not? your whole point was that you didnt pick them cause you think they're cool, but rather because they're &quot;useful&quot;.<br />
our point was to clarify how UNuseful the shadowfiend glyph is.<br />

<br />
^This - seriously, if you don't want to do it then don't obviously changing your shadowform isn't a priority to you, it might be to others. There are numerous other classes who have purely cosmetic glyphs, that's what a lot of minor glyphs are supposed to be - druids can change the way their tree form looks, mages have two seperate glyphs to change how their polymorph looks, and shaman have a glyph to change how their ghost wolf looks. Just because priests haven't had one before doesn't make it a new idea. Druids, mages and shaman all get along just fine with having those options. I have all those toons and have all those glyphs and don't feel like I'm giving up something completely useful to have them. The fact that people have pointed out numerous times the glyphs that you could easily swap for the new shadowform glyph and yet you still argue somewhat proves that's all you want to do. People like you don't care about the glyph choice at all, you just want something new to gripe about. If it wasn't this it would be something else.</div></div><hr />

No. It's a player's decision.<br />

Don't like the visual of the current Shadowform? You have the choice of remaking it.<br />

But you are wrong. The minor glyphs are as useful as i think they are. Meaning they are more useful than something that does nothing. All minor glyphs for classes are just that..... MINOR. They are not called useless glyphs. I dont want to give up a minor glyph for something that changes a visual on my screen. That is lame as hell.</div></div><hr />

tell me, since you have yet to answer this question no matter how many times it has been asked, how often does your shadowfiend die before it despawns on its own? i'm betting never, or almost never, which makes the glyph POINTLESS</div></div><hr />

Opinions, opinions everywhere. You seem to think they're useful, so you have a problem replacing one for this. The rest of us can agree that shadowfiend glyph is worse than crappy, and changing it out for this glyph is a good deal. Deal with it.</div></div><hr />

In PVP it never dies. But thats not really the point. Especially considering pvp isnt the only thing i do. I swap out my glyphs based on what im doing at the time. There are several useful minor glyphs and ones that change visuals should not be glyphs. They should be options in the game menu.</div></div><hr />

Its far more likely to die in PvP than PvE. So if it never dies in PvP by your own admission, how useful is it?</div></div><hr />

It never dies in PVE either, but logic is a language you fail to understand. Use it or don't use it - but don't expect blizzard to make it a &quot;game option&quot; since they never did so with any of the other cosmetic glyphs that they have added. Which also, glyphs in a way are their own &quot;game option&quot;, not sure where you want it, perhaps your video settings? When blizzard came out with glyphs they said they wanted certain ones to give players cosmetic choices, now because you want to gripe about it you suddenly want them to change their design philosophy when it comes to glyphs? Good luck with that.</div></div><hr />

Yes it does die in PVE. Maybe not for you since you have tried it while raiding. But as ive stated before, I dont raid. <br />
<br />
But i think you are focusing too much on that. Just because my glyph choices are not the ones you would make doesnt change that fact that a visual change should not take up a glyph spot. You see to be missing the point and just want to attack me based on what you believe to be bad choices on my part.</div></div><hr />

If you'll recall, the point is that it is SUPPOSED to be cosmetic or have basically no combat value. For some classes, that works out great. Druids have a glyph for Tree of Life that makes a cosmetic change. I don't seem to remember people complaining when they were given what they wanted like this. How did you expect them to make the change if that was what you wanted? I like the current Shadowform perfectly fine, you don't, so they are adding a glyph for you. Sounds like a pretty sweet deal.Anyways, that hurricane - WOW. See that lightning? It's amazing what they can do.</div></div><hr />

Its useful because it dies when im playing solo and i like getting back the mana in a crunch. So go ahead and quote me again and attack me for my reasons considering thats all you know how to do. It might not be useful as you would like, but its far from useless like a purely visual glyph would be.<br />

The whole Divine Aegis bit was stupid on Blizzard's part. &quot;It's confusing.&quot; Right, so you just temporarily replace the spell effect with the same one used for Power Word: Shield. &quot;But you've got a new effect now!&quot; If it is, it's really hard to tell that there's any difference. Blizzard, all you did was just waste your time and ticked off a lot of priest players. Grats?<br />
<br />
Glyph of Shadow is going to be quite popular, though. Right now all you can see is basically the shadow priest's silhouette. Speaking for myself, I find it hard on the eyes when I'm trying to see my priest in a dark area so hopefully the glyph will ease the strain.<br />

<br />
But i think you are focusing too much on that. Just because my glyph choices are not the ones you would make doesnt change that fact that a visual change should not take up a glyph spot. You see to be missing the point and just want to attack me based on what you believe to be bad choices on my part.<br />
<br />
when the fuck does your fiend die in pve? i mean really. it has 90% aoe damage reduction, so unless it somehow magically takes aggro, i don't think you need that glyph.... ever<br />

No i think you are confused. When i said a visual change should not take up a glyph spot im stating my opinion. Just because i believe its right doesnt mean im trying to state that its a fact. Learn the difference.<br />
<br />
And stop changing peoples quotes. That really should be a bannable offense.<br />

Druids have had a glyph to keep their old tree form for a while now...<br />
<br />
That new divine aegis looks almost exactly the same as before... why did they even bother changing it?<br />

<br />
So many people can't see the difference between the old and new Aegis. Here is the old: <br />
<br />
&lt; video snip &gt;<br />
<br />
Main difference: <br />
<br />
New - Just the original after-bubble that pops up<br />
Old - Wicked animation that leads up to the bubble with added border effect on the actual bubble<br />
<br />
Thanks for the clarification. I did notice the border, but I was still thinking I missed something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope nothing changed. I mean the spell effect looks nice and all, But its kinda wasted since the spell is.... pretty much never used.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Lol didn't see this amount of QQ when they gave resto druids the ToL glyph, remember more cheering cause people could change back to the old ToL model instead of being a fat Tauren tree!<br />
<br />
Thats cause resto druids dont exactly have a huge choice of glyphs in the first place, Specially minor. All you really have it.. the dash glyph, ToL glyph, use rebirth without a regant and swim speed increase i think? :P We didnt complain because... well because new ToL form looked terrible!!! Its a no brainer glyph in my opinion. :P</div></div><hr />

His problem was that there was again a person that felt the urge to post a complete useless post just to draw attention, and clog up the forum with crap nobody wants to read and which contributes nothing at all to the forums. <br />
People that do post such things are considered idiots. And from my point of view I wouldn't mind if they got banned straight away, instead of just getting an infraction. <br />
<br />
OT: <br />
Even I don't get the point of the shadowform glyph being the center of yet another complaint. Minor glyphs are supposed to be minor.<br />
So what if your shadowfiend dies while you quest? Will that 5% be sucha huge deal anyway? I doubt it, but hey, if you are not happy about the shadowform thing being a glyph, then nobody forces you to use it. <br />
Ask yourself the question: what is more important for me: the visual appearance, or that shadowfiend i love so much? And chose according to the answer.<br />
Sometimes you cannot have it all.<br />
<br />
You will have to make more choices in real life than in this game, so are you complaning also in real life about everything you cannot get? <br />
See the glyphs as follows: you earn 3000 $ a month, and you can buy 3 things with it, because each thing costs 1000 $. You cannot buy 4 things, because you don’t have that much money. So take a choice…</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm quite sure if there was an option to look as a rotten pumpkin with gnome legs BUT do %1 more damage, you would choose it. I know that I would.<br />
<br />
The glyph is for people giving more importance to appearance. You might find it hard to believe but for some people appearance is so important they go in PTR to be able to arrange their transmog options. People choose nightelf shadow priests and raid just because they like how that race looks. For some people, not being transparent is more important than getting 5% mana back if their sfiend dies. The glyph is for those people. The glyph is not for you, a person considers even the tiniest utility of great importance. <br />
<br />
There is nothing wrong about any approach, but please stop wanting everything.But as far as the glyph doesn't improve my gameplay I like my shadowform as it is and I don't want to be a shadowy-ish kinda priest. I want to be a shadow priest. Looks of my gear doesnt matter at all.</div></div><hr />

it's actually purple, not blue, it appears blue because of the armor set that the priest in the screenshot is wearing<br />

Most DPS Recount watchers forget the side effect of slower attack speed of the mobs all pounding on the tank. In progression content, it's an amazing useful spell to ease some of the burden on healers and tanks in an AOE pull or an OOPS pull.</div></div><hr />
