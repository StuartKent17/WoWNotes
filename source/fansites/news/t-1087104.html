Italian Version of World of Warcraft is Coming to Europe<br />
We have exciting news for our many Italian players: you will soon be able to play WoW in your native language!<br />
<br />
Existing players will be able to download a free language pack to experience the game in Italian when it launches later this year.<br />
<br />
Gamers in Europe will also be able to purchase fully localized versions of World of Warcraft (which now includes its first expansion, The Burning Crusade) and its three following expansions, Wrath of the Lich King, Cataclysm, and the upcoming Mists of Pandaria.<br />
<br />
The games will be available for purchase at retail and digitally through your Battle.net account.<br />
<br />
Of course, the official World of Warcraft website and forums will be offered in Italian, and we’ll also be opening up Italian realms!<br />
<br />
Stay tuned for more information on a release date in the coming months.<br />
<br />

<br />
A few years ago we noted (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/649001-WoW-in-Italian-and-Polish-Blue-posts) that Blizzard was hiring for Italian and Polish positions. There was finally an announcement today regarding the upcoming Italian localization of the game!<br />
<br />
This time around Blizzard has added more Polish speaking positions on their employment page (http://eu.blizzard.com/en-gb/company/careers/directory.html#region=Europe). They were also hiring for Turkish speaking positions in the past, though all of those appear to have been filled now. There is a possibility that we will see a Turkish localization in the future, but keep in mind that it took years from the first Italian postings for us to see the localization. <br />
<br />
The Battle.net Mobile Authenticator was updated (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/215540-new-languages-for-battlenet-mobile-authenticator/) was updated recently to add Italian and Polish support. This points to a strong possibility for a Polish localization in the future. However, it is possible they are localizing things other than World of Warcraft, so don't get your hopes up yet! <br />
<br />
Keep in mind that has been no official announcement about any other localizations and the job postings don't mean that other localizations will happen anytime soon, if at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
Statistics: Insane in the Membrane<br />
Today we take a look at the rate at which people are completing Insane in the Membrane (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/2336/insane-in-the-membrane/)! The sample size was ~5.6 million level 85 characters with a total of ~11,000 that have the achievement. <br />
<br />
Departing from the way we normally graph the numbers, this graph shows the number of new achievements earned each week, not the total. You can see the big spikes recently caused by the new Darkmoon Faire have boosted the number of people with the achievement. Previously the faire coming to town would cause much smaller spikes. <br />

Resilience In Mists of Pandaria<br />
Just as a heads up for you all, Ghostcrawler is currently in the process of writing up a blog that will include some information pertaining to the changes that are on their way in Mists of Pandaria for stats, Resilience included. I would recommend keeping your eyes on our blog over the coming weeks to catch a glimpse of what is to come.

It would be really cool to see a comparison of the Rogue Daggers vs the Caster Staff in terms of quickness of completion and how many of them have been obtained over X time period. Also it would be nice to see a graph of people with over 100 mounts/companions or silly stuff like that. Those are the first things that came to mind =D</div></div><hr />

Indeed, I farmed dire maul and spent like 40k in auction house for the shen'dralar reputation, then it was insane, now it's more like &quot;kinda crazy&quot;. This nerf to the achi is one of the biggest negative things blizz has done to WoW in my 7 years of playing :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that's going a bit to far 741 people got it in a month! That's still pretty damn rare considering there's 10 million+ people playing wow.<br />
<br />
The rest of the months there's a slight change......<br />
<br />
I can tell you for sure i still wouldn't go through the hassle for a title.<br />

It would be really cool to see a comparison of the Rogue Daggers vs the Caster Staff in terms of quickness of completion and how many of them have been obtained over X time period. Also it would be nice to see a graph of people with over 100 mounts/companions or silly stuff like that. Those are the first things that came to mind =D<br />
<br />
I agree with the dagger one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would like to see how many actually left based on a new server opening, we will never see that but i would bet its pretty low. I would think more NEW people would choose those servers over say a US based server for example.<br />
<br />
That said there hearing people pretty loud i wouldn't expect any servers taken offline as that would be bad press but i can think of other possible ways of fixing the issue that other games already do (Even a few f2p games) i have been on a low pop server for 5 years (Ravencrest us horde side) so i feel your pain.</div></div><hr />

50% of all quest rewards and loot are paid directly to your family (guild).<br />
<br />
On a serious note I am very happy that localisation brings WoW to people in their native language, however they really do need to look at the wasteland of empty and dying EU servers it leaves behind and take responsible action to help low pop realms.<br />

Actually you can notice that many European languages have so much in common due to the latin origin. Take Italian and Spanish. I am from Romania and despite not taking a single Italian/Spanish course I can understand both languages quite well due to their common origin. I learned English by watching subed cartoons on tv when I was young. I can understand a bit of German due to some similarities with English. Picked words in Japanese by watching anime. All of these things simply because I watched/listened to stuff in original language and associated the sounds to the subs below.</div></div><hr />

Just to be clear, you compared the insane title to a PhD at Harvard... and you don't think you're going a bit overboard? Here's an idea... get a title even fewer people have like Rank 1 in PvP. Obviously you're willing to put in hard work, so go for it!</div></div><hr />

The PhD analogy serves to demonstrate my belief and what should be a FACT that the subscription fee for WoW should provide you with access to the game and access to the game only. Everything else should be decided by the player's merits.</div></div><hr />

Because from a business perspective, more language support = more people able to play. More people able to play = more money.</div></div><hr />

Same with RunetotemEU, 90% Italians here. If you check wowprogress there's just 2 serious English guilds left (used to be about 15 in TBC) I'm in one of these guilds and we simple don't have people to recruit anymore. This is really holding back our progress.<br />
We're thinking about transferring but maybe if a bunch of Italians transfer to those Italian realms it will free up some space for English people to transfer back to Runetotem. Or they make these realms Italian and give us English players free transfers, would be better imo.</div></div><hr />

No wonder when you go play a new game you sometimes meet people who can't speak English even though it's a game developed in said language. How is it that people from all over Europe can learn English but Italians, Germans, French, Spanish etc need the game translated in their mother tongue? This is why you have such a big gap in communication between gamers all around Europe. Some just cba to try and learn an international language. If certain gamers wouldn't get so spoiled maybe they would have an incentive to actually learn something and turn gaming into a positive experience.<br />
<br />
Seems odd to me that anyone would be opposed to having WoW put out in many different languages. So what if you encounter someone walking around that might not speak English or w/e...honestly it's not a problem I've run into very many times on any US server. Most of the foreign people I've met thru WoW have been spanish/portuguese speaking (all from S America), a few Indians and a small handfull of Aussies and English folk. Maybe it's different on the &quot;Oceanic&quot; realms or whatever but damn dudes, let them have their thing. <br />
<br />
It seems rude for you to say &quot;LEARN ENGLISH IF YOU WANT TO PLAY WOW OR JUST DONT PLAY AT ALL YOU WEIRDO FOREIGNER! GAAAAWWWWWWWWWW!!!!! WHY oh WHY must you make me interact with you if you cannot speak my tongue?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Just think of all the games and stuff people would miss out on if they weren't released in more than just the language of the developer's location.<br />
<br />
How the hell would it &quot;turn gaming into a positive experience&quot; by making/forcing someone to learn English if they wanna play? I'm American, English is my first language (and for what it's worth my only language) and I absolutely HATE it. It's such a crappy, broken, formless language - I don't blame people for wanting this game released in their native tongue.<br />

I am from Eu, not born in a English speaking country, Romania. My point is people have become so lazy. How many people have you met that it's just impossible to communicate with. Let's not forget that communication is the basis of an MMO. If you can't communicate with one another you can't really play because you don't know what the other guy is thinking. To give you another example I also play League of legends. That is also a game that relies heavily on communication and coordination. If a guy can't do so that just hinders the team. Furthermore you are more likely to learn something because of an incentive. Take SWTOR, the game has great plots and twists, if you don't understand the language you miss out on so much. Because you love Bioware games and you love story driven games you might decide to learn English so you understand what they say. Hell here is an example you might have heard yourself, children who learn how to read at the age of 4-5 because their parents don't have enough time to read to them so they learn and read the stories themselves. <br />
<br />
As someone noted in an above comment, and you have examples in every game out there, huge communities of Russians, Polish, Italian, French etc take over a server and fuck it up for everyone there. If everybody talked English you would lose the language barrier and situations were people would be marginalized because they don't speak a certain language will be gone. <br />
<br />
Also here is a funny question, how can people play a game that is written in a language they don't understand. Furthermore how can people not know English when 90%(estimation) of all the things out there are in English(movies, songs, food, holidays etc). <br />
<br />
As a final note, you said you only speak English, how can you say those things about your language when you do not have anything to compare it with. How do you know that only English suffers from those defects? Maybe that's how every language is. Already discussed the positive experience above but let me just give one more example. How many people haven't started doing something because they saw someone else doing something they liked such as football. In a gaming context, how many people didn't start playing MOBA like LOL because they saw a friend play and they thought it would be cool if they could play themselves. Now they might not know how to play a MOBA genre but due to the fact they like the game they learn. Now if they didn't like the game what do you think the odds would be off them wanting or managing to learn how to play a moba game? Now the positive aspect is that if you learn to play a moba you learn a bit about playing an RTS.<br />
<br />
Hope this clears stuff.<br />
<br />
PS: How can people from less industrially developed countries manage to learn English yet people with a higher education system can't. I mean if you look at most eastern countries you will probably find more English speakers than in the western area?</div></div><hr />

LOL dude Stop crying and go back to your English-only speaking Battle group beside like mister Phaidrae Said English is so full of flaws its in fact...English is one of the least evolved languages out there thats why is so popular so i dont blame ppl for not learning it i speak, English, Spanish, (a bit) French and i can understand a bit, German and Italian and of ALL English is the easiest most simple and ignorant of them all Why do YOU think English ppl dont care to learn another language CUZ TOO HARD for them, because they speak the most BASIC world wide language.<br />

'Cause it's personal preference. You are lost around the world without English in 95% of cases, you aren't lost if you don't speak Italian. I'm Slovenian, you're or their neighbour and I don't speak Italian yet, but I have the hardest problems right in Italy asking for directions, cause 9 out of 10 people I ask, don't speak English, either they don't want to or they can't, I don't know. I have no problems like that in any other country Hungary, Slovakia, Germany, Austria, but ok I'm fluent in German but even there I sometimes forget and ask in English and almost everyone is willing to help in either broken or fluent English. <br />
<br />
That said, it's also hard to find help in France.</div></div><hr />

P.S. <br />
<br />
To everyone who puts forth the &quot;special snowflake syndrome&quot; argument: There is nothing wrong with wanting to have a token that represents your endeavors and successes in a certain field. If everyone was simply handed a PhD in Law, for example, at Harvard because there is a tuition to be paid, then Harvard's reputation would plummet and people wouldn't apply anymore.

also many muslims there, and thats why you never will see the game in arabic version although egypt and other countries match the same stats as turkey there. I think many muslims would take offense in the demonic content and other godless stuff promoted in the game and therefore would be banned. I personally wouldn't mind if nothing of the game was to be localized, I always found it silly that the game started with many english names and every patch notes there where those &quot;important&quot; changes where they changed the name from npcs into german, and I thought what a useless waste of time and resources. And I am sorry even on german servers I never ever ran over an turkish speaking player or with a turkish accent, so I can't imagine it to be popular, just because people have online access doesnt mean its used for gaming.</div></div><hr />

Yup, This. The way I see it. Once anyone can have everything, then everything becomes Irrelevant. You NEED certain things to only be achievable by the best of the best. You need things that not everyone can get, Because its that drive to get &quot;better&quot; To become one of the &quot;best&quot; That makes people keep logging in. When its all &quot;meh I can just do dailies for a few days&quot; and get it... then you wont care anymore. My opinion, Blizzard either gives everyone an I win/ free epic's button or they make you beat your head into a wall for days without success. They either go too far, or not enough, never inbetween the two extremes.</div></div><hr />

Well I'm not surprised a German player has a completely skewed vision of Turkey, which is one of, if not the most, secular Muslim majority countries in the world since Ataturk. WoW is not banned there by any stretch of the imagination and I don't think it's ever been close to being banned. Just look at this (http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&amp;n=turkey-grows-rapidly-in-online-gaming-2010-09-14) for instance. <br />
Without Shen'Dralar and without DMF it's not even time consumming, it's a complete travesty that the FoS is still in the game at this point. Both of those could be bought in order to complete the achievement within a few weeks. If one didn't buy Shen'dralar then chances are one got most of the required mats while farming DM:N anyway. Honestly, quit crying and go stack rocks or something if you want to be unique and famous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will just state this up front: the game does not exist to make players feel special, it exists to entertain a large number of subscribers in order to generate a profit.<br />
<br />
<br />
nerfed to the group then all these kids wear it oh so proudly....<br />
<br />
Nerfed to the ground and only 11,000 people have the title after three years?<br />
<br />
Also, your dismissive attitude about anyone who didn't get the title when it was &quot;hard&quot; as being a child is both offensive and wrong.  This title (in its original form) took time and patience, no skill above basic gameplay was necessary. Skill made it faster, not obtainable.<br />
<br />
<br />
inb4SpecialSnowflakeSyndrome. Yep, I have special snowflake syndrome with regards to this, yes I'm FURIOUS it got nerfed and yes I find it appalling that the new DMF gived DMF rep (rumored? I don't get rep since... you know... spent almost 1m getting all my books, diamonds and decks before Cata thinking it was going to be removed).<br />
<br />
Yes, god-forbid Blizzard puts in a new area where people can have fun, earn currency toward new pets/mounts/etc, and receive reputation with an otherwise avoidable faction.<br />
<br />
Spending a million gold to earn an achievement you thought was going to be removed is unfortunate. But, like everything in WoW, making assumptions like this can be risky (had the achievement been taken out, you would be touting how you were glad to have spent the gold to get the achievement).<br />
<br />
Don't be mad, think of it this way: You spent 1m so when people elitist-inspect you and see that you got it before cataclsym, you can hold your head high and brofist them if they did the same.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh well... I'm an elitist, yep. I always check the dates of people's insane achievement and /guffaw /golfclap them and /s snarky remarks about post cata achievements.<br />
<br />
I'm sure they are crest-fallen when the awe-inspiring Ilnezhara disapproves of the date on their achievement. Also, way to be mature about other people's accomplishments in a game. You say the Insane made you feel special, yet you are actively trying to insult people for what might make them feel special... but the shame is that &quot;kids&quot; can have the title now.<br />
<br />
<br />
You guys DIDN'T do insane in the membrane, you didn't... not even close. Without Shen'Dralar and without DMF it's not even time consumming<br />
<br />
The achievement still requires Darkmoon Faire reputation. The fact that there is a daily hub for it now does not mean that it doesn't take time, just less of it. After cataclysm, bloodsail reputation is no longer soloable (at least not at a fast rate like it was in wrath). One could argue that the time-consumption has merely been reallocated to avenues that do not require large amounts of gold, but I suppose being able to buy the achievement is what made it special.<br />
<br />
<br />
it's a complete travesty that the FoS is still in the game at this point.<br />
<br />
Yes, because Blizzard needs to keep taking out content and rewards just to appease a very small group of people... -_-<br />
<br />
The fact of the matter is that you have the achievement from when it was hard, that should be enough for you to feel special. If others don't care about dates on achievements and you let that affect how you view your accomplishment, you are the one with the problem.<br />
<br />
If you want to feel special while being able to hold your accomplishments over the heads of others, please work in the real world to better humanity.</div></div><hr />

Bloodsail was one of the easiest parts of the achievement since you could pull 10 guards without any trouble. Now, you have to fight them one at a time and be very safe about it. They also removed Free Knot! quest in DM, so besides finishing all the quests, you need to just grind pirates for hours (19 hours in my case). At least doing the Free Knot! quest allowed you to farm Shen'Dralar rep as well.</div></div><hr />

so just STOP your ignorant rasism and let the rest of the world be....u stay in you English-only speaking bobble :cool:<br />
First of all English and Italian have different origins as languages so comparing them is like saying oranges are the same as apples just because they are both fruits. Secondly I highly doubt you are in any position to talk about how evolved the English language is compared to others given that analyzing a language is a far more complex process than you give it credit for.<br />
<br />
Some fun facts taken from Wikipedia just so you don't think I make stuff up like you do : &quot;Modern English, sometimes described as the first global lingua franca, is the dominant language or in some instances even the required international language of communications, science, information technology, business, seafaring, aviation, entertainment, radio and diplomacy.&quot; So basically the entire world is wrong and you are right...Oh wait it's actually the other way around. Also the most basic world wide language as you called it is actually sign language, and by this I don't mean what the deaf people use. You know stuff like choo choo when you want to say a train and you don't know how. And racist really? Do you even know what the word means and what it applies to?<br />
<br />
Here is a tip go learn to type first if you claim you know English and it's such an ignorant language and secondly before going to bed you might want to read a dictionary and learn the meaning of some of the words you keep throwing around just so you don't embarrass yourself when you say something to people in real life.<br />

<br />
I REALLY tried to find something in this news post regarding the game being dumbed down, and the only thing I could fathom you referring to would be the Italian localization.<br />
<br />
Are you saying that people who speak Italian, not English, are uneducated? People who know Italian for the EXACT same reason you know English? Because of where you were born? The only thing more ignorant than that that I have heard this year has come from Rick Santorum's mouth. World of Warcraft is a global game, and if Blizzard wants to expand it's player base it needs to add support for the diverse languages around the world.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I would love for there to be a 'global' language... and English is definitely looking to be it at this current time, but that is still a long long ways away if it is ever going to happen. Do you really think that the people who translated the game into Italian are the same people who are working to improve gameplay or graphics? No... they are TRANSLATORS, they do not do development.</div></div><hr />

if want a real benefit for your life/work you need learn chinese, english isent the most used language.<br />
Left baby cry about italian, but you must admit that italian/latin isent the most used language in europe just because romans respect others people traditions/languages. english is most used just for english colonies Austalia, Usa and ex commowelt nations and as i tell you at start, in 10/15 years for work/international commerce you must use only chinese</div></div><hr />

While Chinese is the most spoken language in the world, mostly due to China's insane population... it is very doubtful that it will become a world language. Almost all businessmen who do international trading with countries that do not speak their native tongue speak English. In Chinese schools, you learn English. <br />
<br />
China could very well change that if it plays it's cards right over the longterm (30-50 years), but as of right now the only thing it has going for it is the fact that it is keeping its currency artificially depressed. China is really only known for it's exports on cheap labor at this current time. It really needs to grow other industries to support it's population long term before it can be considered a top-notch country.</div></div><hr />

Oh look another uneducated fool. Just fyi the roman empire did impose their language and beliefs on all the territories they conquered. It was all done at an administrative level though. Also there is a difference in most used and most spoken. English is the most used. Btw here is another fun fact. Do you know where the highest number of English speakers in any country is? USA, neah it's in China. I wonder why? <br />
<br />
Also it would take more than China becoming the nr 1 economy in the world to make English lose its king status. Furthermore in China they don't have a single language. They have several dialects which overall compose the Mandarin Chinese.</div></div><hr />

true but you dont considered 2 facts<br />
1) chinese comunity is closed<br />
2) in every country there is a strong chinese presence, many economic activity in europe and usa are now controlled from chinese borns in usa or europa, and i dont think that they continue use english.So if all principal industry of usa and europa are controlled from chinese, you realy expect that people arent forced to learn chinese for work or affairs?<br />
<br />
trust me in 10/15 years chinese will become the most used for commerce</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all it's uneducated not indeducated or ineducated(which means a person with a lack of general knowledge). Also when we talk about the English language we are not referring only to the UK but other countries and people around the world who use the English language.Regarding your colonies yes they did impose the English language, but just like with the Romans it was done on an administrative level. Furthermore people who went to America came from from the uk for the vast majority. Of course people from all over Europe came as well but most of the people there were English who had a problem with how their country was ruled at that time. Also England is only a former shadow of what it once was. USA is the main promoter of the English language today. Sure Mandarin Chinese might become the preferred language of choice when talking about business, but a language has way more components, such as music, movies, books, the internet etc. <br />
<br />
Also economists don't bother studying what language people will use in the next decade or so. That's why you have sociologists who work withing the economical field. While it's true that China has been making progress when it comes to trying to promote their language, Mandarin Chinese is not as easy to learn as one might think, not to mention learning to write with their characters so if it does end up becoming a global language you will need to have some a HUGE cultural change.<br />
<br />
PS: Like I told the other guy, grab a dictionary and read what some words mean before you make a fool of yourself in real life, because I am pretty sure you did that on the internet more than once. Just fyi a dialect is a regional or social variety of a language distinguished by pronunciation, grammar, or vocabulary, especially a variety of speech differing from the standard literary language or speech pattern of the culture in which it exists: Cockney is a dialect of English. In our case Mandarin is a dialect of Chinese. Other commonly used dialects are Cantonese, Hakka.<br />

The reason French, Italians, Germans, Russians etc don't know English is due to their country dubbing everything. New movie comes out, when it reaches the screens it's already dubbed. Everything is dubbed there. I learned English well enough to speak it before going to school just by watching subbed cartoons as a kid.

You know that language is one of most important thing of a national culture?If want kill a people just kill their language.For example in english we have home/house, in italian we have 20 differents words, without count dialets, and i think that is same in germany/russia/spain/french, true we dumbed all, but we make this for preserve ours language and culture.i play with swedens/greece/russians/romanians, true we use english for comunicate, some spoke english better of me, some lesser, but not for this i call them uneducated o they call me in that way because they dont know italian culture and i dont know sweden/greece or russian culture.This is just respect.<br />
<br />
p.s. about the baby that cry because for make bg/cross realms we need 1 only language, i want just remeber him that<br />
1)in bg/cross realm people dont read chat o listen, skilled players read chat o listen, but the mass simple act following their ideas/personal stupid noobs tattic, and many of them speack/read a perfect english<br />
2)raid/bg used a very semplificated form of english, a modern form of battle tongue, so know english isent necessary if you know what make and just know that 200/300 words used in bg/raids</div></div><hr />

Maybe you misunderstood what I said. Nobody is asking you to replace your own language with another, but not learning something with which you come in contact everyday seems lazy to me. And there are more words that describe a living place than just house/home like dwelling/settlement etc. If anything learning a new language enriches ones culture rather than diminish it. Also I never called anyone uneducated because they couldn't speak English. One can't really know much about a certain topic if he wasn't thought or learned by himself.</div></div><hr />
