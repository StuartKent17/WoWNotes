Thank you Blizzard for these achievements! It's been an amazing experience discovering and attempting each of them, we had a lot of fun transforming into a raptor to steal treasure, fishing up the lurker, and building a snowman. We're looking forward to more fun and challenging achievements in the future!<br />

<br />
You cared enough to make a comment, the people who did obviously care, achievement hunters care, Mount collectors care, collectors in general care and many others.<br />
<br />
Just because you couldn't give more of a shit beyond asked who cares about this stuff doesn't mean that no one else cares.<br />

i remember when this was something special. when you had that one and only cool looking mount, that was unique. when it was fun to collect mounts and to collect the next one to get towards that magic 50 or maybe 100. when every mount was different and something new. when it was fun to collect them.<br />
<br />
but then happened.... some inflation. some strange shit happened and blizz out of nowhere thought that ppl MUST HAVE way more to collect. that there MUST be 10, 20, 50 mounts in one xpac. a mount at every corner. 5 copied pasted wolf models and 5 copied pasted boar models in WoD. and another 10 copied pasted fuck of whatever.<br />

Some people are satisfied with just achieving something without a bunch of fanfare and attention. Not very many people anymore, but there are a very scattered few of us. Not everything needs to have a trophy. <br />
<br />
This is exciting for those that were directly involved. They deserve a little congratulations, but they didn't just win the Superbowl or something. Or whatever the MLG equivalent of that would be. If there is any.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Could you link one of those unique mounts. Honest question because I can't seem to recall many, except for maybe the ahes of al'ar back in tbc and the cenarion hippogryph from CE quartermaster. Not exactly many.<br />
Since WotLK when these kinds of achievement mounts were introduced, we've had reskins or virtually every single mount. And it makes sense. Making a skeleton for a single mount and never reuse it is just too resource intensive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They made collectibles dull and boring when trying to add so many (just like achievements).<br />
<br />
Instead of quality, they went for quantity. In the end it made most people not care about achievements/mounts/pets/toys anymore.<br />
<br />
I used to farm every single mount, pet, toy and achievement in the game, but then we've got to a point where it just became pointless because there were so many, most of them just like mount reskins or usual stuff (like the &quot;oh, the samer horse mount for alliance&quot;, &quot;oh, the same wolf mount for horde&quot;), and each patch/expansion, more and more of these were tied to RNG systems to make the grind longer (but in the end made it tedious).<br />
<br />
It is like, if they have some kind of minimum quota of mounts/pets/toys/achievements to fill for each patch. The mounts from paragon chests were the &quot;ok, no more, thanks&quot; for me. Not only the system itself was unnecessary (reputation is one of the few things you can actually complete in a MMO, and it's good for a MMO to have something that you can look forward to complete within it's own the expansion), but the rng was stupid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The original assertion was that the race was dead since a long time ago. This was disproven as false since the last race reached #1 in twitch. Now several people are making distintinc claims such as the one you are making. The #1 on twitch fact argument was used to disprove that the race is dead. It is not dead, in fact its so alive that while its ongoing wow is the #1 streamed game in twitch.<br />
<br />
As for it would have more viewers if it were streamed in a non specified past. Dubious at best. Streaming, has grown exponentially, wow subscription data is no longer published so only insiders know exactly how many people are playing. <br />
Let’s look at 2012:<br />
<br />
At its peak in October 2010 the game had 12 million subscribers. As of November 2014 the game has over 10 million active subscribers. On January 28, 2014 Blizzard announced that 100 million accounts have been created for the game.<br />
<br />
https://twitchtracker.com/statistics<br />
<br />
The game had in the ballpark of 11 million subs.<br />
Twitch had 1/12 of the current average concurrent viewers. <br />
<br />
Could wow progression streaming attract higher viewership in 2012 vs now? The data doesn’t allow for a 100% certain response, but it sure seems difficult.</div></div><hr />

again streaming was new at the time, i said that if streaming was as popular as it is now it would've had more.. also since no one was streaming wf race its understandable why it had fewer viewers as well</div></div><hr />

<br />
Instead of quality, they went for quantity. In the end it made most people not care about achievements/mounts/pets/toys anymore.<br />
<br />
I used to farm every single mount, pet, toy and achievement in the game, but then we've got to a point where it just became pointless because there were so many, most of them just like mount reskins or usual stuff (like the &quot;oh, the samer horse mount for alliance&quot;, &quot;oh, the same wolf mount for horde&quot;), and each patch/expansion, more and more of these were tied to RNG systems to make the grind longer (but in the end made it tedious).<br />
<br />
It is like, if they have some kind of minimum quota of mounts/pets/toys/achievements to fill for each patch. The mounts from paragon chests were the &quot;ok, no more, thanks&quot; for me. Not only the system itself was unnecessary (reputation is one of the few things you can actually complete in a MMO, and it's good for a MMO to have something that you can look forward to complete within it's own the expansion), but the rng was stupid.<br />
<br />
Can you tell me how they did not go for quanitiy before, and instea quality, but now go for quanity instead of quality?<br />

I used to care about collecting shit but damn they just continuously add endless garbage of the same shit. They gave up trying to be innovative. What was even new this xpac? expeditions and warfronts? wow cool its basically just more dungeons to gear up alts amazing... BC and wrath were so amazing because they were 2 new xpacs that gave people a completely new way to play the game (flying, arenas, achievements hell even cata gave RBGs and MOP gave challenge modes) but now its just reskinned everything<br />
<br />
sad but true.</div></div><hr />
