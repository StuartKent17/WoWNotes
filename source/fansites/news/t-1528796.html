Warlords of Draenor - Tier 17 Shaman Armor Set<br />
Today we are taking a look at the Tier 17 Shaman armor set. No Mythic set has been added for Shamans yet. <br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor changes things up slightly by using one set of art for Raid Finder, one set of art for Normal and Heroic, and one set of art for Mythic difficulty. You can find the Raid Finder armor sets in our Raid Finder armor sets preview (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3940-Warlords-of-Draenor-Raid-Finder-Armor-Sets-Draenei-Guard-Armor-Set-Blue-Tweets-Art). <br />

The Iron Maidens<br />
With little opportunity to exercise her tactical brilliance under the ancient social structure of the orc clans, Gar'an was thrilled to be one of the first warriors to volunteer for naval duty under the Iron Horde. Instantly successful in battle, she was named Admiral of the Iron Horde fleet and selected Marak and Sorka as her lieutenants. Together, they are called The Iron Maidens - and have crushed any who have dared face them in battle.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overview - The Iron Maidens periodically gain Iron Fury. As the Maidens gain Iron Fury, they gain new abilities. Periodically, one of the Maidens will use a zipline to man the Dreadnaught's main cannon, from which she will bombard players. A team of players must use loading chains to get to the deck of the boat, defeat the Deckhand stationed there, and sabotage the ammunition of the main cannon before it finishes Warming Up. Whenever one of the Maidens reaches 20% health, they will all activate Iron Will. Players must then quickly defeat them before being overwhelmed.<br />
<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/dps.png&quot; title=&quot;Dps&quot; /&gt; Damage Dealers - Blade Dash can be deadly - avoid standing close to other players if you are battling Sorka.<br />

&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/tank.png&quot; title=&quot;Tank&quot; /&gt; Tanks - Move between Marak and the target of her Blood Ritual to intercept the effect of Crystalized Blood.<br />
Minimize damage taken by Marak's melee strikes while Sanguine Strikes is active.<br />

Azzakel, Vanguard of the Legion<br />
On Argus - the former homeworld of the Draenei, now the stronghold of the Burning Legion - Azzakel waits, poised for a servant of the Legion to open a portal to one of the countless worlds they seek to invade. As Soulbinder Nyami lowers the defenses of Auchindoun, Azzakel senses that his services will soon be employed towards the destruction of the holiest of Draenei temples.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overview - Azzakel alternates between engaging players directly in combat and summoning reinforcements from the demon world Argus.

<br />
Overview - As Witherbark attacks he consumes his stores of Aqueous Energy. At 0 Aqueous Energy, Witherbark gains Brittle Bark and Aqueous Globules form at the edge of the lake and move towards him. Each globule that reaches Witherbark restores 25 Aqueous Energy. If a globule crosses paths with an Unchecked Growth, it animates and attacks. At 100 Energy, Aqueous Globules no longer form and Witherbark loses Brittle Bark, freeing him to attack.<br />
<br />

Any chance you can tell me the character base move speed in ft/sec and the base shot speed in ft/sec?<br />
Base player move speed is 7yd/sec.Aimed Shot travels at 40yd/sec.What's your concern? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470667302539894784))<br />

how many times are we going to be refreshing sunfire in solar? aiming for max power or duration?<br />
For boss DPS, probably two Sunfires per Solar; that gives you 100% Sunfire uptime. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470384395535126528))<br />
<br />
Why not make Wrath/Starfire share a button similar to moonfire/sunfire now that stopping the eclipse bar isn't a thing?<br />
Confusing to have a button swap mid-cast. Just makes the rotation easier. There's skill to picking the best one, timing-wise. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470381795704193024))<br />
Can the Starsurge buff be split between Wrath/Starfire? Does it set which buff based on bar position or first cast?<br />
You get one of the two Empowerment buffs based on where your bar is when you cast Starsurge. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470387398421925888))<br />
<br />
with astral storm being removed, is hurricanes' spell damage type being changed in any way?<br />
No, still Nature. Though planning a glyph to swap Hurricane to Astral Storm and Starfall to Sunfall. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470477063359430656))<br />
they'll switch between eclipses with that glyph or no?<br />
No, just always. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470479158280069120))<br />
ok, with the change to starsurge, is it just a instant cast buff that doesn't do the spellstorm damage anymore?<br />
No, it still does the spellstorm damage, and has a 1.5sec cast time. It's still Starsurge. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470480339173785600))<br />
So Starsurge being instant is ruled out?<br />
No, not ruled out. Just trying with a 1.5sec cast time first. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470665334991912960))<br />
<br />
Could you please briefly describe how Crit/Haste/Readiness will affect the new Balance talents i.e will haste affect cycle time?<br />
None of those affect the cycle time. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470667012759617537))<br />
<br />
Noticed on some notes that Ravage is being removed. Will feral dps get some new Sunday punch or what excatly?<br />
Ravage was merged with Shred. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470468741788999680))<br />
<br />
Quick Q regarding Ursa Major - can both MS from a single event proc it?<br />
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470480177676316672))<br />
How does it work?Always 2% ? Or stackable % ?<br />
Its benefit rolls. Whatever % is left (based on time) from the previous buff is added to the next one. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470510054827773952))<br />
Example: You've got a 24% buff up, with 25sec left, and refresh it. 24%*25sec/30sec = 20%. Plus new 2%, result = +22%. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470511259960352768))<br />

Where within Black Arrow does the guaranteed lock and load take place?<br />
Somewhere; no guaranteed spot, just somewhere. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470480143538860032))<br />
One assumption is that if it hasn't triggered by the last tick, it must on the last tick.<br />
Yes, that'd be fair, through process of elimination. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470664574514237440))<br />
(Oh, that's not how it works, though. It's not like the last tick ends up having a higher proc frequency.) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470664764742721536))<br />
Any info on how it does work?<br />
It determines at cast time how many procs there'll be, then randomly distributes those procs throughout the ticks. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470668856877666304))<br />
Proc count starts at 1, then it has successive 20% chances to add 1, until it fails a roll. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470669260583624705))<br />
That's kind of neat.Proc count=2, 10 ticks, rng generator rolls 2 times, predetermining ticks 3 and 7 to proc...?<br />
Yep. But you don't need to know any of that in order to play optimally; that's just the nitty gritty. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470698171635871744))<br />
Prob. Pushing my luck, but IF black arrow works with readiness, would that lead to oddities with &lt;20 second cd?<br />
Perhaps. It's something we know we'll need to solve if we do put Black Arrow on Readiness. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470702054311481344))<br />

Avert Harm is taken away, Black Ox: Guard, and the Dizzying Haze &quot;misfire&quot; as well. So where is brewmaster utility? TBR?<br />
Misfire was basically non-existent; didn't work on bosses. Brewmasters are extremely mobile, good at controlling damage, (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470672941974552577))<br />
and good at picking up new adds. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470673061998780417))<br />
<br />
Regarding the #WoD changes to Black Ox Statue's &quot;Guard&quot;, what do Brewmasters now have to provide any type of wall for our raid? <br />
If you're talking an Absorb effect, nothing. They do still have healing. Chi Burst, Chi Torpedo (undertuned on live, I know). (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470666428648263681))<br />
Thank you for responding. But I mean, aside from &quot;kite tanking&quot;, what mashes Brewmaster diserable vs any other tank now?<br />
They're still very good tanks. Ox Guard was minor. Other tanks lost things similarly. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470672403719528448))<br />
I don't argue that, all of the tanks are good tanks, Blizz has done a great job. But, I now bring no raid utility, just AOE slow<br />
We're bringing down the raid utility of *all* tanks, not just Brewmasters. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470673790570332160))<br />
that's fair. I just felt that AoE damage reduction CDs, felt really nice in the hands of the tank role. Being the raid's shield.<br />
Feeling-wise, I totally understand and agree. Gameplay-wise, we need to reduce the number of such CDs, and tanks are one... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470677151105429504))<br />

Does Devouring Plague's DoT still scale with Shadow Orbs used in WoD? Tooltip change is kind of unclear.<br />
In effect, yes, since the DoT is now a % of the direct damage. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470667588482383872))<br />
Just to double check: The &quot;additional 100% damage over 6 sec&quot; means 100% of the direct damage dealt, not 100% of SP over 6 sec?<br />
Correct. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470671843519897600))<br />

FinalBoss - Blizzcon 2013 Live Raid<br />
In the Blue Tweets above, Watcher mentioned that the Blizzcon Live Raid is one of the most popular events at Blizzcon when someone asked about having one this year. If you didn't watch it last year, FinalBoss has released (http://finalboss.tv/main/2014/5/30/episode-44-blizzcon-2013-live-raid) a nice cut down version of the live raid that is faster to watch. <br />

Unless they're planning on making healers have access to interrupts. Druids do have access to a talent at 75 - Mighty Bash - that's a stun, as well as <br />

I think the devs have mentioned a lot about how minimizing your movement to maximize your DPS would be one of the bigger factors in doing more DPS. DPS will just have to be smarter about their movement choices for WoD and rely less on being able to cast while moving. It's something Shadow is already dealing with.</div></div><hr />

The Iron Maidens<br />
With little opportunity to exercise her tactical brilliance under the ancient social structure of the orc clans, Gar'an was thrilled to be one of the first warriors to volunteer for naval duty under the Iron Horde. Instantly successful in battle, she was named Admiral of the Iron Horde fleet and selected Marak and Sorka as her lieutenants. Together, they are called The Iron Maidens - and have crushed any who have dared face them in battle.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wait, what? I thought that orc culture is neutral in regards to sex, or even leaning on the side of matriarchal when considering positions of power like Greatmother. Where does this sudden sexism supposedly come from? Comics? Books?<br />

The treatment of the womenfolk is probably on a clan by clan basis. Geyah wasn't the leader of the orcs in Garadar, her husband was - and leadership fell to Garrosh (the whole point of the player character getting involved is because he was useless as a leader) when he died. In Rise of the Horde, Blackhand treats his daughter Griselda as basically a non-entity. He's got &quot;the heir and the spare&quot; in Rend and Maim, and Griselda was just sort of ... there. Any time she's shown interacting with her father she's usually scolded or cuffed for some perceived wrongdoing. He actually forbade her from drinking the blood of Mannoroth because of her &quot;insolence&quot;.<br />
<br />
Besides, as the quote about the Iron Maidens implies, it seems most of the &quot;sexism&quot; comes to matters of war. Female orcs might be equal or greater in matters of the hearth or clan (Greatmothers or mates to clan chiefs) or in shamanism, but the military might be expressly the dominion of the men.</div></div><hr />

theres easy answear - those wont be tuned at raid having 5:1 range vs melee ratio only for example 7:7 - so range having less mobility and loosing dps wont be that much of problem.</div></div><hr />

I thought the whole point was to describe what the boss was going to do and let you devise your own strategy; it just straight up tells you what to do now.<br />
The people that this is actually intended for don't read the dungeon journal now so i don't see this changing anything.</div></div><hr />

Unless the &quot;interrupt&quot; is some gimmicky mechanic and/or this was meant for dps. Priests say hi.</div></div><hr />

I really expected more out of an expansion whose major players - Orcs and Draenei - both have strong shamanistic aspects of their culture. Like Slappyjoe just said, this looks like a dungeon set - I don't even think the shoulders look that fancy, I think they look like crap.</div></div><hr />

The way they sway back and forth is just nauseating and is the reason why I believe the Challenge-mode set for Shamans is probably the most hideous looking gear/shoulders in the game.<br />
<br />
This is why I am happy for transmog.</div></div><hr />

Seriously though, any/all of these sets could be for any class. The Dragon Soul set was the last thing that looked even vaguely Shamanistic.<br />
<br />
Maybe its just me, but my goodness the art direction has been awful since WotLK.</div></div><hr />

Ya I know, tornadoes could really represent any class :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
If there's one thing I've determined with peoples' reactions to tier sets, is that you truly cannot please everyone. Call me crazy, but the marquee aspect of any set are its shoulders. And those shoulders are, in a word, awesome. As is the belt. Is the rest of it a bit lackluster? Sure. But with transmog, it really doesn't matter one damned bit. And those tornado shoulders will look good with any shaman set.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, yeah. apart from the cyclone's which could be druid as well, it's rather neutral.. <br />
<br />
Also, that belt... it's a bit prone to sexually tinted jokes. Like, Blizzard is just asking for people to call it the &quot;....sucker&quot;, it is no matter how you looke at it blowing the groin-area. :confused:</div></div><hr />

Any realize how far along they are with ´alpha´.. not only do they have raid encounters in the game, but they have the journal entries started. That is something that usually hasn´t happened til very late in Beta. I don´t think we are going to be getting a beta until the game is almost ready to ship.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, it's one of the reasons I don't like to call this an alpha. Feels like early beta except without the access.</div></div><hr />

My statement is quite sound, thank you. I'd appreciate you abstaining from name-calling.</div></div><hr />
