Is it intended to have multiple Power Word: shields on a player at the same time? i.e. I have PW:S from myself on me. and I have PW:s from a different disc priest on me.<br />
That's intended. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/398481-discipline-bug-thread/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20419912912?page=2#37))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Why did you take heat as a ret paladin nerfer? They were so faceroll OP in WOTLK pvp.<br />
I often joked about nerfing them and somehow that started being taken seriously. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/687650779964911617))<br />
<br />
As worlds in games get bigger, it seems they also become more empty, What can we as players and devs do about this?<br />
Maybe devs have to give players more tools to create their own content. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/687650989482983424))<br />
Doesn't even need to be new art or dungeons. Being able to offer other players quests could be huge. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/687651121104461826))<br />
<br />
not sure if you have had a chance to see proposed tank changes to Legion alpha but ur take on it would be appreciated<br />
They make sense to me. Defeating a boss should be a team affair. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/687651444799877121))<br />

It's an easter egg, obviously. Hogger surely didn't exist back then, if you look at it from a serious point.<br />
by the way:<br />
If I'm not mistaking, they were recording the crowd roaring &quot;for the alliance&quot; at the blizzcon to use that crowd roar later in the movie. But according to the lore, the &quot;alliance&quot; didn't even exist back then. The first &quot;alliance&quot; was formed during the second war (this movie is about the first war) and was called &quot;the alliance of lordaeron&quot;. So is that supposed to be an easter egg aswell or did they screw up the story? I mean it's totally fine if there are some small variations of the lore, but something that big?<br />
what do you guys think?</div></div><hr />

what do you guys think?<br />
<br />
Maybe the factions will form at the end of the movie, finishing with both factions screaming ?<br />
<br />
Also don't forget the movie is adressed to everyone, including people who are not familiar with the lore, and they're the vast majority. So the story may be adjusted to fit in the world we have known since Vanilla (flying Dalaran, Stormwind being the capital instead of Lordaeron, etc.), so it won't loose the majority of the public.<br />
<br />
You should all stop expecting a lore-friendly movie, it won't be,it was already said by Blizzard... This would the best way to make you hate the movie.<br />
<br />
However, the easter eggs, the overall look the movie, makes me think it will be faithful to the universe, even if the story is slightly changed.</div></div><hr />

Not really an easter egg, but the shop in back is the 'Denman Family Jewelers&quot;, which is the jewelcrafting trainer's shop in the game, in Stormwind.</div></div><hr />

Yea, not sure I'm sold on that set. Looks kinda mickey mouse to me and an attempt to be too literal with the translation from the game world. Hope I'm wrong and we'll see.<br />
<br />
As for Hogger, if the movie is set 30 years prior, who is to say that isn't him. For all we know, Hogger might be hundreds of years old.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that metal trim around message board is supposed to look metal - a bit shiny, some rust perhaps considering its outside, nailed to the board itself. Instead its like rubber/foam or something. The chains that are holding this thing are ridiculous. Anyone who ever tried to lift a wooden door made out of actual planks of wood, would tell you that these chains are not gonna hold. But since its made out of some L200 or some other plastic shit, sure lets use chains from home decor store.</div></div><hr />

We will probably see it for a fraction of second or a few seconds of the movie, at best. Most viewers won't even notice what posters are pinned on it.<br />
<br />
I fear that staying too close to the game's aesthetics may be an error though. They clearly want to please the fans first, but it could backfire. Those not aquainted with Warcraft may not appreciate the cartoonish look of the sets. And since fans are the most nitpicky of viewers, as we had proof in this very thread, it is even harder to please them. On the other hand, we saw what happens when a video game adaptation strays too far from its original source (Super Mario, to name one). Personnaly, I would have prefered a more realistic look, but I must admit that I was rather impressed by the trailer. So I will wait to see the final result.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Theres a big difference between easter egg, hard work and total illogical stuff that proves the team isn't researching or paying attention. It's the state of the game and this movie is going to be rife with &quot;historical inaccuracy&quot; to appeal to people who don't or cannot read the quest text or pay attention. To be honest I think it's absolutely worth criticizing as it's just simple continuity. Don't make a movie in the past if you cant be bothered to do basic research.<br />
<br />
Stuff that shouldn't be on that board as this takes place before and during the first war. 1) Dark Moon Faire, While I have no hardbased evidence that a Dark Moon Faire predecessor existed 30 years before WoW began, it as certainly billed as a new event when it was introduced that has arisen due to recent Oldgod related activity on Azeroth that just wasn't happening back then, not to mention the backstory and characters that compose the faires troupe not having been a thing. 2) Hogger, while mentioned, theirs no way he was alive. We know they are a generally pretty short lived race, but he couldnt be active and still posing a minor problem that far back in time. Even if Hogger is the Son of Hogger, or even grandson of Hogger Sr, The Gnoll incursion wouldn't be occurring, especially with Stormwind at the height of it's power. The Gnolls in the area were story lead in to Redridge and the entire plot of that zone. Not to mention that even happened because of the lack of military at the time due to the first war and the subsequent loss of many of them at sea to the Naga attack. 3) according to Neilson, Brewfest began shortly before Chen joined Rexxar in Kalimdor.<br />

I've never understood the point of these trash items. It's zone-specific, it has like a year long cooldown and it only lasts a few seconds. It's not even worth having on your action bar, so you're very likely to just ignore it. Blizzard added the same kind of stuff in WoD and they're next to useless.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frontenac</div><div class="date">2016-01-24, 05:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Theres a big difference between easter egg, hard work and total illogical stuff that proves the team isn't researching or paying attention. It's the state of the game and this movie is going to be rife with &quot;historical inaccuracy&quot; to appeal to people who don't or cannot read the quest text or pay attention. To be honest I think it's absolutely worth criticizing as it's just simple continuity. Don't make a movie in the past if you cant be bothered to do basic research.<br />
<br />
Stuff that shouldn't be on that board as this takes place before and during the first war. 1) Dark Moon Faire, While I have no hardbased evidence that a Dark Moon Faire predecessor existed 30 years before WoW began, it as certainly billed as a new event when it was introduced that has arisen due to recent Oldgod related activity on Azeroth that just wasn't happening back then, not to mention the backstory and characters that compose the faires troupe not having been a thing. 2) Hogger, while mentioned, theirs no way he was alive. We know they are a generally pretty short lived race, but he couldnt be active and still posing a minor problem that far back in time. Even if Hogger is the Son of Hogger, or even grandson of Hogger Sr, The Gnoll incursion wouldn't be occurring, especially with Stormwind at the height of it's power. The Gnolls in the area were story lead in to Redridge and the entire plot of that zone. Not to mention that even happened because of the lack of military at the time due to the first war and the subsequent loss of many of them at sea to the Naga attack. 3) according to Neilson, Brewfest began shortly before Chen joined Rexxar in Kalimdor.<br />

They already said that the movies are their own thing. And again, those posters are only there as Easter eggs that most people won't even notice in the movie. It will be seen for only a few seconds, if even that. It's just a nudge to fans.</div></div><hr />

Fair, I just wish the easter eggs were more along the lines of &quot;Oh look it's so and so's father or them as a kid&quot; head nods instead of &quot;We don't know whats going on, throw something they will recognize in their faces&quot; style.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Laylriana</div><div class="date">2016-01-24, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just hope this dialogue is in that movie somewhere:<br />
<br />
Orc character: How will we clothe him?<br />
<br />
Camp tailor: Bring me 10 pristine hog hides, 8 sabertooth fangs, 1 peerless forest wolf pelt, and a needle and spool of thread. The hides can be found from the wild hogs who roam south of here, sabertooth range to the west, and forest wolves can be found all around us. You will have to sneak into the human’s village to get the needle and spool of thread. You must not be seen doing this so they aren’t alerted to our presence here. When you have gathered these things bring them to me and I will craft garments for him to wear.<br />
<br />
Then there is a scene of the orc standing in a clearing surrounded by 50 slain hogs saying, “7 pristine hog hides so far.”</div></div><hr />

Hardly important, it's just say &quot;Wanted Hogger&quot;, he could be anywhere in the Kingdom of Stormwind.<br />
<br />
These are small Easter Eggs for the fans.</div></div><hr />
