Undocumented Changes/Spell Comparison<br />
Please note that the stats of the spells here are taken directly from the game files and might be different from the officiel patch notes. This is a list of the differences between tooltips of classes spells, just don't jump to any conclusion just because a change is here and wait until it reaches the live server.<br />
<br />
Most of the changes here were revealed in the latest update of the official PTR notes. <br />
<br />
[b]General<br />
Hearthstone (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=6948) cooldown has been reduced from 60 to 30 minutes. <br />
<br />
Racial<br />
Gift of the Naaru (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=59547) now also removes 2 harmful magic effects from the friendly target. <br />
Stoneform (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=20594) no longer gives a 8 second immunity to disease, poison, and bleed effects.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=650) / Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?deathknight))<br />
Blood Strike (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=49930), Heart Strike (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=55262), Obliterate (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=51425) and Scourge Strike (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=55271) had their tooltip changed to say &quot;total damage increased 12.5% per each of your diseases on the target&quot; instead of just &quot;damage increased etc ...&quot; but this is probably just a wording change.<br />
Blood<br />
Abomination's Might (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=53138) now also affects Death Strike.<br />
Unholy<br />
Desecration (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=55670) radius seems to have been lowered from 10 to 7 yards, due to the nature of this change (spell effect changed instead of the spell itself) I strongly suggest that you wait until the PTRs are online before taking it as confirmed<br />
Glyphs<br />
Glyph of Strangulate (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=58618) now reduces the cooldown of Strangulate by 30 sec. (Down from 60 sec)<br />

Also, I really, really hope Psychic Horror is a baseline skill. Self-cast Penance really isn't going to magically fix Disc PvP.<br />
<br />
On an unrelated note, I really don't understand why Mortal Strike debuffs are still in the game. Does anyone really think that healing is too powerful in PvP at the moment?<br />

Lightweave Buff roxx, if it stays at 45s inner cooldown that would mean 83,33 Spellpower. So much better than 23 Haste &lt;3</div></div><hr />

How come every 2v2 team has a healer in it whilst it takes ages to find a healer for your heroic run (i.e. they are underpresented on realms). So at least healing doesnt need more buffs seeing how it already destroyed every 2x dps teams out there.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, because 2v2 is the only kind of arena in this game, right? And all of us healers are holy paladins that can roll face to 2200 whenever we feel like it? Protip: there's something called 3v3 and 5v5 arena, and Druids, Shamans, and Priests do exist.</div></div><hr />

<br />
78 vs 23 Haste is a no brainer and way overpowered. We can assume that Blizzard will be nerfing the proc rate or the internal cooldown. All the other professions have something in line of 37-38 SP improvement over what's available to everyone, so we can assume that this will equal something along those lines.</div></div><hr />

IF YOU ARE READING THIS BLIZZ, MAKE DIFFERENT ABILITIES WORK DIFFERENTLY AGAINST PLAYERS, instead of nerfing said ability. They do this once in a while but not enough. Instead, they end up nerfing a class for pvp's sake and destroying it in pve. A change in philosophy is what is needed, not strict nerfing.</div></div><hr />

You're forgetting we lose the haste, which makes it about the same benefit as other professions. <br />

<br />
No, I'm not. Well, not sure which class you're looking at, but for the most part, haste is only considered 1/3-1/2 the value of spell power, IE: most classes would take 10 SP over 23 haste, as such, you should expect the value of the proc to equal out to 50ish SP</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Reticulated Armor Webbing<br />
Requires Plate<br />
Permanently inserts reticulated armor webbing into plate gloves, increasing armor by 800.<br />
<br />
Attaching the armor webbing causes the gloves to become soulbound. An Engineering skill of 400 is required to keep the webbing active.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Permanently attaches a springy arachnoweave to a cloak, increasing spell power by 11 and allowing you to turn the cloak into a parachute to fall slowly for 10 sec.<br />
<br />
The cloak can only be used once a minute and requires an Engineering skill of at least 350.<br />

Both from engineering of course</div></div><hr />

Currently 50% of players playing arenas in 2v2 bracket are healers, and outside of arenas only 15 % of players are healers. If it somehow gives you an idea blizzard needs to buff healers even more, you seriously need to stop posting on this forum.<br />

<br />
<br />
While I agree, 38 spell power is still so much better than 23 haste there is no comparison. You are also forgetting that tailoring is very neglected right now. This change will definitely make tailoring more interesting from a min/max stand point. After you throw in all the other bonuses that come with tailoring (crafted flying mount, extra cloth gathering in Northrend, and next to free leg enchants) it starts to make tailoring look pretty damn good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here is an idea. Remove stuns from the game, or at the very least remove stun lock. I don't know very many bosses that aren't immune to stun lock, so it wouldn't be a pve nerf, and the biggest problem people have with rogues is they can kill you before you escape their stun lock. That change would balance the field in pvp and leave pvp unaffected.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
83 spell power is still much more powerful even when losing haste. Depending on the class haste is worth between about .5 and .7 spell power. That means that losing 23 haste would be like losing 11.5 spell power then you gain 83 spell power which will come out to a gain of 72.5 spell power.</div></div><hr />

Hell I'll gladly take the 11 spellpower the engineering cloak enchant will give over the 23 haste. <br />

To be honest, I don't see any reason why all CC's, snares and stuns included, don't have a chance to break on damage. CC should be used strategically, not as some idiotic place-and-forget ability that you can use to wail on someone for free for 6 seconds straight.</div></div><hr />

Precisely, which is double the amount gained by other professions. I'm betting we're gonna get something like 20% proc, 70s cooldown, which would be about 50 SP averaged out over the duration.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has already announced the new replacement. It is called divinity and gives a 1/2/3/4/5% increase to healing done by and to you. The rest of the tree looks the same on the calculator until you actually try to use it and find out it is not. However, this is the same calculator wowhead has as well, so I'm going to assume that it just isn't fixed on test yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I doubt it. If they nerf it at all it will be to the spell power coefficient. I say this because blizzard balances all of their procs on a 45 second cool down because its easier for them to do it that way. I doubt they would change the proc cool down. The 20% proc I highly doubt also because procs on everything else are pretty much guaranteed which again allows for a balancing issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason I used those numbers was because there are some procs in the game that currently use that model, and at 250 SP, it would fit into the right aproximate amount of added power. I think lowering the SP of the proc and keeping it 50% / 45s Internal cooldown WOULD be the better way to go, but since Blizzard set it to 250, I'm thinking they must've nerfed how often it procs. Anything else, would've just been an epic oversight of Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Not entirely true. JC is pretty amazing for casters currently.<br />
<br />
Consider a caster in full epics with a total of 3 blue sockets that add +5 spellpower each for their socket bonus, just like the Heroic Judgement at the Eye of Eternity neck reward.<br />
<br />
A non-jc caster will put two purple gems in his gear to activate his meta gem and a +19 spellpower gem on every other blue socket, for a net gain of [9(gem) + 5(socket bonus)] x 2 + 19 = 28+19 = 37.<br />
<br />
A jc caster will put 3 Runed Dragon's Eyes on these blue sockets, which will net a total of 37 (32 + 5) spellpower per blue socket while still activating his meta gem. 37 x 3 = 111 spellpower, which is a 74 spellpower advantage over non-jc casters.<br />
<br />
The tailoring change merely puts the profession up to par with jewelcrafters, which is currently too good and the primary profession choice appointed by every single elitist jerk's caster guide as the best choice for min/max.</div></div><hr />

Yes, JCers FTW currently for casters. However, if they are finally attempting to bring other professions up to par with JCs... why just tailoring? I'm hoping you're actually correct, and we'll see buffs for all the professions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
U will never learn from your mistakes, or THINK before u do things. This clearly shows that Blizzard has absolutly NO clue what they are doing.<br />
<br />
Back being a BM again, cant say im disliking it. I just wish u didnt nerf the shit out of it, then buff Survival so ppl become used to it, then buff BM again and nerf Survival. You cant make 3 viable DPS trees wich all do same dmg! Theres always 1 that will win over the others, cant you get that through your thick skulls!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Consider a caster in full epics with a total of 3 blue sockets that add +5 spellpower each for their socket bonus, just like the Heroic Judgement at the Eye of Eternity neck reward.<br />
<br />
A non-jc caster will put two purple gems in his gear to activate his meta gem and a +19 spellpower gem on every other blue socket, for a net gain of [9(gem) + 5(socket bonus)] x 2 + 19 = 28+19 = 37.<br />
<br />
A jc caster will put 3 Runed Dragon's Eyes on these blue sockets, which will net a total of 37 (32 + 5) spellpower per blue socket while still activating his meta gem. 37 x 3 = 111 spellpower, which is a 74 spellpower advantage over non-jc casters.<br />
<br />
The tailoring change merely puts the profession up to par with jewelcrafters, which is currently too good and the primary profession choice appointed by every single elitist jerk's caster guide as the best choice for min/max.<br />
<br />
You're using the wrong numbers.<br />
<br />
Jewelcrafting is a profession we *know* what the missing recipies are going to be. There's currently no epic gems in game, but there will be - with 3.1 if I'm not mistaken. Also, try not to use the socket bonus, it might be different for different wardrobes (and besides, you're comparing two bonuses and that bonus exist equally on either side of the line). To prove my point, the socket bonus wasn't attributed to the red gem for the non-JC, either, thus running on the assumption that there's three blue sockets - likely but not guaranteed. Even more, socket bonuses aren't all +5 spell power, you might be looking at +4 intellect or +6 spirit.<br />
<br />
Non-JC: 23 (red) + 2x12 (purple) = 47<br />
JC : 32x3 = 96<br />
Difference: 49, with a possible extra socket bonus<br />
<br />
Regardless, Tailoring and Engineering need some motivator for personal gain during raids.</div></div><hr />

Don't post if you're incapable of at least posting semi-coherently and intelligently. Hunters were OP. No one who has looked at the numbers or seen the parses would deny it.

<br />
Numbers aint the same as actuall playing the game in different situations. You see a hunter do high dps on some chart or at some boss and call NERF! I used to be top DPS in BT/MH raids throughout TBC for months. With me, rogues and warlocks were also top DPS. Since Woltk all these classes have been hit by the nerfbat, and hybrids are taking over in DPS and Utility. Im not expecting to be top DPS in my average but descent naxx gear set, but im not topping dps meters by far, and the other hunters arent either.<br />
<br />
In PVP however, i agree the TNT stun was enoying. Also vipersting was a priest killer, and should simply be removed from the game.. since it only worked vs a priest anyway. In its current state its an insult to the Hunter class. Again you fail in building up some constructive sentences, and in what way you think hunters were OP?<br />
<br />
Your also forgetting the fact that a Hunter is a PURE dps class. More so then Mages, Rogues and Warlocks cause a Hunter doesnt have reliable, unbreakable, undispellable and above all spammable CC.<br />
A Hunter also has no DEFENCE. And no detterence is no defence, it its a suicidal ability when u are stuffed with dots, or fighting a pala. I play this game well over 3 years, 220 days played on my character. Been top ranked in Arena in S3, Server 1st kills with my guild since SSC, so ur L2Play comments wont affect me at all :p.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
They are more reliable, unbreakable and spammable then a Hunters CC. Mages even more so, and Rogues.. dont get me started. This is besides the point. Im not trying to say others classes need to be altered. If you have ever played a hunter at max level, wether it was 60,70 or 80, you know and cant possibly deny that hunters are the outcast class of wow.<br />
<br />
I actually dont mind that at all. Everyone can play any class, but to actually master that class takes alot of time skill and dedication. When the class i play and love gets thrown around, changing the way i prefer to play in a bad way many times in a short time span. Yes that pisses me off. But Hunters are flexible, and i dont expect much anymore for the class. Things were better when Blizzard didnt took every 12 year old serious when he started an OMFG NERF THIS CLASS thread.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Non-JC: 23 (red) + 2x12 (purple) = 47<br />
JC : 32x3 = 96<br />
Difference: 49, with a possible extra socket bonus<br />
<br />
Regardless, Tailoring and Engineering need some motivator for personal gain during raids.<br />
<br />
<br />
Jewelcrafters have to stop pulling the same old excuse that everything will be more balanced when epic gems are out. They're not out now, they're not coming in 3.1 and they're not coming until tier 9 and there's absolutely no reason for them to not add an epic version of Dragon's Eye with updated stats, or BS will pull ahead of every other profession.<br />
<br />
Yes, you're right when you say not every item has a blue socket with +5 spellpower for it's socket bonus. But two of the current best-in-slot items for casters, being the Malygos neck and Cloak of Penance do. Even if you end up using Legs of Mortal Arrogance and get 6 critical strike rating instead of 5 spellpower you're still head and shoulders above other professions. I liked how you purposely left out the amount of spellpower you'd get from socket bonuses by socketing 3x Runed Dragon's eyes in blue slots on your calculations just to make the numbers seem closer than they really are. The more Jewelcrafters try to hide and twist the real numbers the more it shows they know how OP the profession really is.<br />
<br />
Unfortunaly, playing dumb doesn't change the fact JC needs a nerf, and will probably get one sooner or later.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On an unrelated note, I really don't understand why Mortal Strike debuffs are still in the game. Does anyone really think that healing is too powerful in PvP at the moment?<br />
<br />
Right disc priests arent unkillable as it is and in the time it takes you to blink someone can be fully healed by peanance. Quit your crying it takes atleast 2 people to kill any half way smart disc priest. Not to mention your completely immune to any sort of kick or interupt considering all you need to outheal practically anything is a renew ticking and your powerword shield then the occasional flash of light while you fear. Now you want a 10 second disarm too? Are you kidding me your class is tard proof and can stay alive through any class in the game being on them.<br />
<br />
I think your missing the point of how healers should work. They shouldnt be unkillable on their own its a smart teammate with them in 2s that should make them hard to kill. Not sitting there thinking your good with a renew ticking for more dmg then your receiving while you just laugh and mana burn people.<br />

Yes 18 seconds of complete CC immunity takes alot of skill. Please dont attempt to run your mouth when you played the biggest nub spec in the game. Let me guess you thought being able to use 2 beastial wraths in a row was fair too huh?

U didnt bother to read the post you quoted. If you had, you would notice that it was actually a response on someone's post that again quoted a post that I initially started. This isnt about BM hunters getting nerfed to the ground, its about Survival. Besides the fact that your living in the stone age where BM were op, do you really think 18 Sec immune to CC is OP? Well then u must think Devine Shield is the king of OPness with its 12 sec duration and not only being immune to CC, but also DMG and the ability to heal while unable to interrupt.<br />
<br />
Imo its only fair that a spec wich has no CC (Beast Mastery) Also has a high resistance against CC. Everyone that thinks Hunters are a 4 button class cant be taken seriously. Blizzard has even stated that Hunters have way to many keybinds, and more are comming with each patch making a hunter one of hardest classes to play in PVP.<br />

The real point is that in 213+ ilvl gear survival are still topping damage meters pretty easily. What hybrid class do you think is getting close? Dk's, and their top spec is getting nerfed this patch too. No one else. Honestly, you referring to survival as being &quot;nerfed into the ground&quot; is completely ridiculous. With black arrow it will be a different play style, but very similar dps to what it was if you're playing it correctly.<br />
<br />
And you really shouldn't argue it being op in pvp, because everyone knows it. It's not even debatable. This relatively small nerf will only help even it out a little bit. Don't don't go saying &quot;YOU DON'T PLAY A HUNTER YOU DON'T KNOW!!!&quot; because i do, and I'm hardly upset about this tiny nerf. Survival Hunters will still be top 5 in 25's easy if you know how to play it, and survival will still be a viable hunter pvp spec.</div></div><hr />

<br />
CC abilities I didn't name because they were more than 11 points into another tree or of limited use against a limited number of classes: Concussive Barrage, Silencing Shot, Immolation Trap/Explosive Trap/Explosive Shot, Counterattack, Wyvern Sting, Scare Beast.<br />
<br />

BM with scatter shot?<br />
BM with entrapment?<br />
Traps share cd so its either frost or freeze?<br />

Fair point - it's very unreasonable to expect someone to spend 11 points for pvp utility instead of sinking 71 into the one talent tree.<br />
<br />
Yes, roots, spell lockouts, slows, silences and stuns are all categories of CC.<br />
<br />
<br />
And yes, a BM hunter has access to ALL the pet abilities of every species. That's actually their 51 talent.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MuTe</div><div class="date">2009-03-05, 08:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The real point is that in 213+ ilvl gear survival are still topping damage meters pretty easily. What hybrid class do you think is getting close? Dk's, and their top spec is getting nerfed this patch too. No one else. Honestly, you referring to survival as being &quot;nerfed into the ground&quot; is completely ridiculous. With black arrow it will be a different play style, but very similar dps to what it was if you're playing it correctly.<br />
<br />
And you really shouldn't argue it being op in pvp, because everyone knows it. It's not even debatable. This relatively small nerf will only help even it out a little bit. Don't don't go saying &quot;YOU DON'T PLAY A HUNTER YOU DON'T KNOW!!!&quot; because i do, and I'm hardly upset about this tiny nerf. Survival Hunters will still be top 5 in 25's easy if you know how to play it, and survival will still be a viable hunter pvp spec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hybrids arent supposed to get close! They are not PURE DPS classes, Hybrids have way more utility in raids then PURE dps classes. Do you really expect they should do the same amount of DPS, and can offtank/offheal at the same time, and bring along great buffs? I also didnt say that YOU DONT KNOW HOW TO PLAY HUNTER. But the guy i was quoting said BM Hunters is a 4 button class, i said he cant be taken seriously. But if you agree with him and also use only 4 buttons as a BM hunter, then you dont know how to play hunter. There i said it!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Are you seriously trying to argue that hunters are not one of the best kiting classes in the game, it not the best? If so, rofl.<br />
<br />
<br />
Eh no?! I havent mentioned the word &quot;kite&quot; once. I said BM hunters havent got much CC abilities, therefor require to have high CC resistance. And the guy that i quoted is trying to me a smart ass and name all the CC's that are available to ALL hunters trees and ALL hunter specs and ALL pets in the entire game to prove his point BM hunters DO have CC. And that my friend is just plain dumb.<br />
<br />
And if you wanne talk about kiting. Hunters HAVE to kite in order to survive, BM hunters have the least amount of CC to be able to kite good. Therefor they need BW.<br />
BM hunters only have:<br />
<br />
Intimidation: short 3 sec stun (on pet next attack, hard to time properly) 1 minute CD.<br />
CC shot: short 4 sec slow effect, 30 sec CD.<br />
Wingclip: 10 sec slow effect, only in MELEE range.<br />
Frost or Freeze trap: 30 sec CD, easy to dispell, or to freedom urself out of.<br />
A pet ability: You can only have 1 of the special abilities that helps with CC at the cost of DMG mostly. Most are on also on a 40 sec CD and last for 2 to 4 sec.<br />
<br />
BM has the least amount of CC's available, they cant stop casters from casting, cant interrupt, cant lockdown anyone. And im not saying they HAVE to, but they NEED the immunity to CC, otherwise the spec would be useless.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
No BM hunter in the right mind can have acces to Intimidation, Entrapment and Scattershot in the same time without being a utter noob.<br />
And again Immolation trap, Explosive trap are NOT cc's. Scare Beast IS a CC and available to ALL hunters, only vs beasts (druids).<br />
You have no clue what a hunter is, yet you try to argue with someone who has been playing hunter for 4 years?<br />
<br />
Your right to say roots, spell lockouts, slows, silences and stuns are all categories of CC, but a BM hunter doesnt have silence and spell lockouts. Also they can only have 1 pet ability at the same time, wich is most likely on a 40 second CD. They have 1 really short stun on a huge CD, 1 really short ranged slow, 1 descent melee slow,1 trap that shares CDs and 1 pet ability with a really shot duration on a really big CD.<br />
<br />
Whats the point in arguing with someone who just looks at a talent tree to state his point.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I'm sure many BM hunters would prefer to pvp with no CC at all not much CC in their pve spec. They would not be noobs at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
And again Immolation trap, Explosive trap are NOT cc's. Scare Beast IS a CC and available to ALL hunters, only vs beasts (druids).<br />
<br />
They are if you have TNT. Hunter pets are also beasts, as can be shaman. You will also note I excluded that from my initial list as it had limited applications (hunter pets, druids, shaman) rather than universal.<br />

You have silence and spell lockouts available as a pet ability. Regardless, you've already admitted you were being histrionic when you stated that BM was &quot;a spec wich has no CC&quot;, and that was the point I wished to correct you on.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

I know, it's so much easier arguing with people who don't even look at their spells or what their class can do and just make baseless complaints about how much their class sucks because OMFG they've been playing for FOUR WHOLE YEARS.</div></div><hr />

I lolled at this. ;D If you would spec Intimidation, Entrapment and Scatter shot at the same time, you can better become a MELEE huntard since you wont do any ranged DPS.<br />
<br />

BM hunter dont have TNT!! &gt;:( And if BM hunters had Explosive shot, they would have 2x 51 talents trees............<br />
<br />

Pets dont have silence and spell lockouts. Ur confusing with Warlocks :-X<br />

That list was purely because you claimed I was &quot;naming ALL the hunter CC abilities in all different trees&quot;. The same way the first list was because you claimed BM spec has &quot;NO cc&quot;. Keep up.<br />
<br />
<br />

Pummel and Nether Shock are spell lockouts. Yes, I brain farted on the silence because this conversation has been ridiculous and I started losing track of which spec's CCs we were talking about because there are so many of them compared to other classes.</div></div><hr />

In that list you named abilities that dont make scense for a BM hunter to spec. You also named Frost Trap and Freezing Trap, yet forget to mention they share cd. You also named alot of pet abilities that have nothing to do with CC, and forget to mention you can only have 1 of em per pet.<br />
<br />
Pummel isnt in game yet. And when it does hit live, TNT stuns are removed from game, and wyvern sting is nerf badly. Also back arrow shares CD with traps, so you must either choose the Extra DPS or CC. Yet this is all survival hunter. We are talking about BM hunter here. Your right on the spelllock for Nether Shock, i personally never had that pet since his ability seem rather weak compared to some other CC abilites. Again only 1 CC ability is available per Hunter Pet, and i would only take the best one for PVP.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Langebrød</div><div class="date">2009-03-05, 08:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is an idea. Remove stuns from the game, or at the very least remove stun lock. I don't know very many bosses that aren't immune to stun lock, so it wouldn't be a pve nerf, and the biggest problem people have with rogues is they can kill you before you escape their stun lock. That change would balance the field in pvp and leave pvp unaffected.<br />
I'd be more then happy to give up my stuns for PLATE armor.</div></div><hr />

Agreed Langebrød. For those of you who continue to moan and complain about rogues stun locking have you ever taken the time to watch what happens to a rogue that doesn't stun lock? They get demolished so if your going to say remove stun locking from the game then give rogues the right to use plate armor so we still have some use in pvp</div></div><hr />
