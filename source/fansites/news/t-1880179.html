For a heroic or mythic raider sure. They are okay for normal mode people in most cases I think. Though, im not sure you would use that over a warforged Normal Hellfire citadel or 700+ mythic dungeon proced trinket considering you can upgrade them. Good trinkets for alts and some normal mode raiders. Big enough audience if you ask me.<br />

I'm pleased with powerful gear coming from Mythic dungeons as well. The game ideally should have 2 progression paths in gearing up process:<br />
<br />
The game has been plagued by raid or die model for far too long. You can go fuck yourselves with your insane mythic dungeon ilvl requirements because I will just make my own group and complete it anyway. In case of raiding this isn't that easy. I'm not feeling like leading 15-man group of people and doing all the tactics. But 5-man in a dungeon everybody knows already? Sure, no problem.</div></div><hr />

500 per piece. Pretty reasonable. I almost expected them to make it 400-500 per upgrade to tide people over longer. Thats still 7-8 weeks per toon though, so a win for them.<br />

What do you like then? Raiding? HFC is 13 bosses and pretty good. Your set. Move on to mythics. If you have done mythic, either recruit with cross realm mythic to make your roster better or quit until Legion. Raiders dont get to complain about lack of content. Not when half the focus of a major patch is directly spent on them. Every since MoP you have been catered too, and for all of WoD and MoP people that loved dungeons got crapped all over. Sure world content was good for MoP but dungeons werent.</div></div><hr />

The Cap was removed few mounths before Valor was removed from the game.<br />

So i will now run Mythic Dungeons in hope for a Heirloom Trinket to drop? and look like we will be able to upgrade our current Heirloom to 1-110 :)</div></div><hr />

Because raiders can't like dungeons...?<br />

well its not supposed to look like Murozond .. Murozond is unique, he is an Aspect<br />
<br />
Im pretty sure he even looks different from other full grown Infinite dragons ..<br />
<br />
compare:<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/npc=17881/aeonus#modelviewer:10+0<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/npc=54432/murozond#modelviewer:10+0<br />
<br />
Murozonds color scheme is completely unique as it should be<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
that said, there is an actual Infinite Timereaver drake NPC - http://www.wowhead.com/npc=21698/infinite-timereaver<br />
<br />
and the mount model doesnt look much like it either:<br />
<br />
pros:<br />
- the mount model has pretty boss armor<br />
- the mount model has a spiked cool tail instead of the pineapple<br />
- I think that the mounts head model uses the model from &quot;of the N/S/E/W Wind&quot; drakes instead of the older regular pre-Cata Red/Black/Bronze etc. drakes heads. I like the winds drakes better, IMO this is a plus<br />
<br />
cons:<br />
- obviously it lacks the characteristic Infinite ~white webs/cracks. There are white outlines on its scales, but its not the same. Too bad, I wish the mount had them, maybe some day ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which is kind of the point. They're going to be ok/good for leveling 100-110. Other then that, you won't get to get much use out of them. <br />
<br />
These are the WoD equivalent to the SoO weapons. Handy to have while leveling 90-100, but not awesome, and useless after.<br />
<br />
Eventually, these trinket will become unobtainable (I suspect). Blizzard is not going to make unobtainable stuff so good it'll be close to 'mandatory'. Garrosh's weapons are only moderately better than the original heirloom weapons, mostly because of the sockets.</div></div><hr />

Unless we can get valor points from non-lfr raiding as well, I don't think being semi-forced into doing dungeons/lfr every week by the raid (because you will be if you're in one still trying to progress) is anything fun.<br />
Everything else look solid, looking forward to the new timewalking mount.<br />
I wonder whether the quest drop for the moose will drop for everyone in the raid or just one per kill though (properly just one per kill, and I probably won't be able to get it with my shitty dice, a shame).</div></div><hr />

<br />
When they launched, I found them to be a little bit...wonky. Probably easy as shit now that I'm heroic HFC geared, but in heroic BRF gear everything seemed to do a little bit too much damage. Very good for raid awareness training for new players I'd say. The problem kind of stems from them ramping up the numbers massively for mechanics that were designed to be dealt with, but not deadly. Like the spinning hammers in Iron Docks, they do damage instantly before you have a chance to move out, which is fine on heroic because they don't do very much damage, on mythic they shave 3/4s of your health off instantly. You've got more leeway in raids than you do with a lot of the mythic dungeon mechanics. <br />
<br />
Skyreach was pretty brutal too for single target healers just because aoe damage is so high and often.</div></div><hr />

The problem kind of stems from them ramping up the numbers massively for mechanics that were designed to be dealt with, but not deadly. Like the spinning hammers in Iron Docks, they do damage instantly before you have a chance to move out, which is fine on heroic because they don't do very much damage, on mythic they shave 3/4s of your health off instantly. You've got more leeway in raids than you do with a lot of the mythic dungeon mechanics. <br />
<br />
Skyreach was pretty brutal too for single target healers just because aoe damage is so high and often.<br />
<br />
<br />
its almost as if they want you to use CC or something, to counter the high Damage......<br />
<br />
nah :P its called mythic so we must be able to just zerg, ignore mechs, and not cc even at only 670ilvl! NP! <br />

The Wod Mythics are a huge disappointment anyway, literally ramped up damage and HP from CM mode, honestly, if you turn off combat text and damage meters your just doing CM's again... the copy paste content :(<br />
<br />
would be nice if more then 30min was spent making this mythic dungeon content when its just a copy paste job again, like adding a mechanic or 2 to bosses, making trash worth CCing (TBC dungeons forced you to CC because the trash there CC'ed you back.)<br />

<br />
I hope not, it would solve the most annoying problem involved with upgrading a piece of gear which is then having a better piece drop soon after invalidating the upgrade.</div></div><hr />

Yep, there is a cap on the PTR. Subject to change of course.</div></div><hr />

Valor Points (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/396-valor-points) != Valor (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1191-valor)</div></div><hr />

So does that mean there won't be a cap or...?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It means there is no cap in the currency tooltip right now.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xentronium</div><div class="date">2015-10-17, 01:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, it does look to be a new currency. I couldn't get into a dungeon on the PTR to earn any and see which part of the character currency tab it will go in. It should be the WoD one though.<br />
<br />
Looking at the ways to earn valor it looks like the restrictions are from doing weekly events and LFR. The only daily currently available is the heroic dungeon. Early days yet, more could be added in future builds.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RuneDK</div><div class="date">2015-10-17, 04:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would love if they would give raiders doing heroic/mythic to receive valor once per week, per boss(so you can't farm heroic then mythic) for an 80% cap. I wouldn't mind doing a dungeon or two a week, I don't want to have to do a dungeon every day plus the weekly quest or lfr. I don't enjoy doing trivial content that I severely overgear for the same amount of time if not more than what I already raid.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gadzooks</div><div class="date">2015-10-17, 06:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They need to make valor earned through raiding too...Even if it's only on heroic and mythic. Even if it's just 75-80% of the total cap. I do not want to have to run a daily heroic or mythic dungeons to maximize my Valor as a raider on my main. Now my alts, I have ZERO problem grinding that stuff as they need gear anyways. But my main no thanks.<br />
<br />
I suspect that they added valor back in to get people into dungeons, not raids. This is why valor was in dungeons in the first place - to make them worth returning to on a regular basis.</div></div><hr />

Not having it be rewarded from raids as well is stupid. Giving options is a good thing not a bad thing.</div></div><hr />

I was one of the players asking for an infinite dragon mount. I think they look cool! I'm also excited about the return of Valor and being able to upgrade gear. I thought that was a nice feature in MOP. I was hoping this patch would be out Tuesday in time for the next round of Timewalking dungeons, but it's looking more and more like it'll be in a month or two. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly. Valor from dungeons a response to &quot;there's nothing to do outside of raids in WoD&quot;. I'm fine with this.</div></div><hr />
