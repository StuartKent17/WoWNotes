Upcoming Engineering Changes<br />
We've added several new changes for engineers in patch 3.2. Some of these additions may appear in the next public test realm build, and as such, we'd like to tell you what changes are coming. Please bear in mind that some of these changes may not appear in the next test build, and all of these changes are subject to revision until patch 3.2 is officially released.<br />
<br />
Here is the latest version of the 3.2 Engineering section which will be reflected in the patch notes on our forums and website soon:<br />
<br />
Engineering<br />
Added a new Mind Amplification Dish attachment for helmets, allowing engineers to control other humanoid targets. Some restrictions apply: does not work in Arenas, dish sometimes reverses targets, unable to stack with other stat-improving head enchantments and makes your helmet look... stylish?<br />
Added a schematic for a Goblin Welding Beam that can heal friendly mechanical or vehicle units.<br />
Alarm-o-Bot functionality changed. Materials required reduced.<br />
Box of Bombs no longer requires an anvil.<br />
The Cobalt Frag Bomb now incapacitates enemies within a 3-yard radius. A short cast time was added, but they are usable while moving. This change applies to any Cobalt Frag Bombs already created. The existing recipe now makes 3 at a time.<br />
Engineers can now learn to create a portable Wormhole Generator for Northrend. The Wormhole allows them to travel to different locations in Northrend, although the locations are sometimes in dangerous places.<br />
Increased benefits from Hyperspeed Accelerators, Hand-Mounted Pyro Rocket and Reticulated Armor Webbing glove modifications.<br />
Increased the passive bonuses provided by Springy Arachnoweave, Flexweave Underlay and Nitro Boosts.<br />
Increased siege damage caused by Saronite Bombs and the Global Thermal Sapper Charge.<br />
Mote Extractor now has innate tracking for gas clouds while it is in your inventory. Tracking of gas clouds has been removed from goggles.<br />
A new repair bot has been added, and his name is Jeeves. He is the ultimate gentleman robot butler, able to perform all the mundane tasks of repairing, selling and buying junk for your entire raid. Additionally, he can open bank boxes for skilled engineers (350+). Jeeves is not destroyed when used, but due to pressing engagements, can only be summoned once an hour. The schematic for this handsome robot was said to be hidden within the parts of another robot â€“ hoping to be found by an engineer one day.<br />
Nitro Boosts: Now have a 5-second duration.<br />
Potion Injectors now increase the amount gained by 25% when used by engineers. Quantity produced by recipes for Runic Healing and Mana Injectors has been increased.<br />
Reduced the materials needed to create all engineering Dragonlings, and reduced their cooldowns, although they still cannot be used in Arenas.<br />
Significantly reduced the cooldown on MOLL-E.<br />
The Spynocular belt attachment has been changed to a Frag Belt. The Frag Belt periodically produces a Cobalt Frag Bomb that can be used from the belt every 10 minutes (never runs out!).<br />
A Steam-Powered Auctioneer has been added to the Dalaran Like Clockwork engineering shop, allowing access to one's faction Auction House. The Steam-Powered Auctioneer was programmed with a superiority chip, and will only interact with Grand Master engineers.<br />
Transporter devices are no longer classified as trinkets and can be used directly from your inventory.<br />
The Ultrasafe Bullet Machine and Saronite Arrow Maker schematics have been simplified to create a full stack of the appropriate ammunition. No longer requires an anvil. Reduced the materials required to make this ammunition.</div></div><hr />

Tell that to the alchemy people :) they will use flasks in the next patch [in the arena] ;x :o</div></div><hr />

Some nice changes, I am still glad that I rolled engi just before the goggles and nitro boosts nerf :p<br />
Give saronite bombs a incapacitate effect, I would love them even more in BG:s! :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
the flask is added because alchemy is the only proffesion that does not offer a stat bonus inside arenas like extra sockets<br />
<br />
we used to have a endless potion that provided a abysmal ammount of mana or a very minor ammount of health, those will no longer be usable in arenas, instead we gain a stat bonus equal to other proffesions</div></div><hr />

Ha....highly unlikely. JC &gt; Engineering<br />
<br />
Giving up engineering for JC was the best choice I ever made. Engineering is getting nice TOYS in 3.2 though.</div></div><hr />

Portable Gnomish Mind Control Cap (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=10726)... i wish the enchant look like that device!<br />
<br />
<br />
Engineers can now learn to create a portable Wormhole Generator for Northrend. The Wormhole allows them to travel to different locations in Northrend, although the locations are sometimes in dangerous places.<br />
<br />
Now Engineers can PWN Einstein.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mote Extractor now has innate tracking for gas clouds while it is in your inventory. Tracking of gas clouds has been removed from goggles.<br />

Finally... No more farming kit!<br />

[...]Additionally, he can open bank boxes for skilled engineers (350+). Jeeves is not destroyed when used, but due to pressing engagements, can only be summoned once an hour. <br />

Cute! I'll farm the recipe...<br />

Potion Injectors now increase the amount gained by 25% when used by engineers. Quantity produced by recipes for Runic Healing and Mana Injectors has been increased.<br />
<br />
OMFG O.o<br />
Great raiding buff!<br />
<br />
<br />
A Steam-Powered Auctioneer has been added to the Dalaran Like Clockwork engineering shop, allowing access to one's faction Auction House. The Steam-Powered Auctioneer was programmed with a superiority chip, and will only interact with Grand Master engineers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rambaral</div><div class="date">2009-06-29, 10:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see why engineers would be thrilled with this. It doesn't really address much of what has been wrong with the profession. A few of the tinkers are now on par with existing enchants, and an updated MC cap (while long overdue) is virtually worthless with the restrictions on it. With new content, comes new enchants, and engineering will yet again fail to keep up.<br />
<br />
Engineering is still in the same position it was, a &quot;fun&quot; profession with loads of RP flavor, but of little use in a serious raid/PVP setting. Having an exclusive auction house outside the old world to one profession sounds like it won't see live. At best it will make engineering the banking alt profession of choice.<br />
<br />
Yet another type of repair bot is a bit silly, especially considering it does the same thing the new squire does, without forcing a profession on you. Like the other bots and jumper cables, it's neat in 5 mans, but beyond that there are plenty of people with repair mounts and rezes that makes them obsolete.</div></div><hr />

And my guess is that Jeeevs' recipe will probably drop in Ulduar. Mimiron is my first guess. Perhaps hard-mode only? :p If not Ulduar maybe Coliseum, but that one doesnt have a robot boss in it. Yet....<br />

socketing trinkets would be considered as significant buff to both pve and pvp..<br />

While these changes don't satisfy the stat bonuses of all other baseline professions, I still must concur. Engineering is looking better every patch note.</div></div><hr />

Its a start, but its way short of what they could do with engineering to make it on par with other professions.<br />
<br />
I do like the bomb from your belt every 10 minutes though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
all the other changes are nice, and to those screaming about min/max and no benefit to dps, get over it. blizzard said a long time ago, i believe even before tbc, or upon its release that engineering is the FUN profession, and will always be that way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I would love for it be a fun profession, and I'd be happy to take a bit of a hit to my stats for the fun, but as of right now we have little updates to much of what made it a so called fun profession in the first place and little stat benefit to compensate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Epic win changes.<br />
<br />
Everyone else can keep their 60 AP or 30 spell power, I'll be busy having portable access to my bank, mailbox, vendor and using the AH from Dalaran.</div></div><hr />

You choose to get a bunch of convenience perks over a small stat bonus. It's a pretty fair trade. <br />
<br />
It's not like 30sp or 60ap will make of break you anyway. If you are very serious at PVP/PVE then you have to decide if min/maxing for an almost insignificant boost on the meters is worth losing some convenient, fun perks.<br />
<br />
You can always have at least one SP/AP boosting profession along with it and it' really wouldn't be a big deal. JC is also losing the &quot;free&quot; socket bonuses from the prismatic JC gems in 3.2 also, so keep that in mind.</div></div><hr />

A Spell Reflecter, just like the level 60 ones!</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for all the people who seem to think that eng needs to provide the same stats boost as the other professions, I would like to know what are you smocking and where I could get some. Right now they are working to have us not lose the base bonus of basic enchants while we still enjoy our tinkers, thats huge. Should we get the stats bonus of the others as well as all the other stupid/cool stuff we get, there would be no point in the other professions. While I pity the pvp'ers that lvled it just for arena only to have it nerfed, PvE'ers who min/max need to get a clue. Just drop the profession already and dont look back while you are lvling your JC/BS.<br />
<br />
Side note, would love if they made our transporters go in the key ring. But thats a QQ for another day.</div></div><hr />

And my guess is that Jeeevs' recipe will probably drop in Ulduar. Mimiron is my first guess. Perhaps hard-mode only? :p If not Ulduar maybe Coliseum, but that one doesnt have a robot boss in it. Yet....<br />
<br />
MechAnub'Arak? :D<br />
<br />
<br />
perhaps mimirion, but i'dd say XT-deconstructor... or most un-likely but i cenrtainly hope so a mob that is in icecrown or stormpeaks because GIVE THAT ROBOT!!!<br />
<br />
As for evryone else, these Changes rock ass, as ppl moan, idd rather be the handy man in the raids, only thing i now need is an Item that resses me from death and ill be unstopable;) 5 seconds turbo boost is like running from boreantundra to Howling fjors;)</div></div><hr />
