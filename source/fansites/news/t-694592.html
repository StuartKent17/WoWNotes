Titan-Forged Spaulders of Triumph are purchasable by druids as intended.<br />
Lovely Charms now stack to 40.<br />
Any player who has a Lovely Charm Collector's Kit in their bags now has a chance to receive a Lovely Charm when in a group or raid and a group member gets a killing blow as long as they are within a certain range of the kill.<br />
In all difficulties of the Lich King encounter, players who are tanking raging spirits are no longer valid Harvest Soul targets during phase 3, Vile Spirits in phase 3 now spawn at a greater height, and Vile Spirits in phase 3 will not be spawned as often.<br />
In the 10 player Lich King encounter, Raging Spirits have had their health decreased in both normal and heroic versions and then fewer Vile Spirirts will be summoned in just the 10 player normal mode.<br />
Svala Sorrowgrave in Utgarde Pinnacle should no longer get stuck in the air during her transformation phase.<br />
The Blue Sack of Gems earned from completing a random heroic Occulus dungeon is no longer tradeable.<br />
The Tier 10 tanking plate gloves and chest pieces now have their appropriate durability on them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
blizzard should think about that most casuals havent reached him yet. This nerf is just again a gift for the majority of the WoW players: The bad players which play 5 hours a day and call themselves casual.<br />
<br />
and ye an endboss of an addon should be hard no matter which difficulty you engage him. Also: Blizzard should think about that real casuals, if they care, care about one kill and then icc is done for them. There is not much left to do in this game and funny enough the hardcore guilds still have content while the normal player has content clear.</div></div><hr />

And 1 night a week for 10 mans. Any less and we wouldn't be raiding at all. But even we killed him on 10m with 8 attempts left. We wiped more on Sindragosa than the Lich King and now they are nerfing him. I knew they would eventually nerf him but after only 1 week?<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh my God. You defeated a 10-man boss with 25-man gear? How is that even possible? :O<br />
<br />
<br />
Seriously though. People clearing 25-mans and then going into 10-mans and saying they're easy are r-e-t-a-r-d-e-d. <br />
<br />
Also, do notice that it only seems to be the Vile Spirits that were nerfed, as well as fixing it so that the person tanking them shouldn't be pulled away. This means that the Vile Spirits probably weren't INTENDED to play the role that they did previously. Quick your whining, the boss wasn't tested on the test realms, thus they have to make some minor changes while people progress on him. He might be buffed as well, although that's not likely after the first week. We never know, so you'll just have to wait and see.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Quit thinking that everyone are raiding 25-mans, and then going 10-man to farm emblems. Some people are only doing 10-mans(like myself), and so changes such as the Rotface health nerf, and most likely this as well, are needed in order to get the encounter down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
According to wowprogress 2310 guilds killed Sindragosa, while 97 killed the Lich King. These numbers don't support your claim that Sindragosa is harder than the Lich King. Further you are a 25man guild and probably vastly outgear the encounter.<br />
<br />
World 2nd Marrowgar hard mode, world 3rd deathwhisper hardmode. Yeah, you are a casual allright.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I haven't killed Lich King yet myself so I don't know from my own experience. But you can't really use that logic when bosses share limited amount of tries and you have to kill Sindragosa (and other wing final bosses) to get to the Lich King. I bet a lot of these guilds that killed Sindragosa and not Lich King have just blown near all 20 tries on Sindragosa. They could (maybe) kill Lich King in 10 tries after that but they just didn't have that many tries left.<br />
<br />
Again, I'm not saying Lich King is easier. Maybe you are right and he's harder. I don't know. I'm just opposing your logic because it's somewhat flawed :)</div></div><hr />

Why can't we let time (improved gear) and the zone-wide buff gradually tone down the difficulty and, until then, just keep trying the encounter and improving at it.<br />

I understand that the 10-man LK may have needed nerfs as the *real* 10-man guilds have been unable to kill it. But why do we only allow one week before we decide that it's too hard? <br />

<br />
I understand where you are coming from, but the fact that they changed something doesn't always equate to a nerf. The first change appears to bring the encounter more in line with where they intended the encounter to be. The second change might be a tiny nerf, but I have a feeling that it's not because it was too hard, but after further testing, they decided that they'd given them too much health. I don't really think that it meant that it was too hard, it was just not where they'd intended (and perhaps they had the same health as in 25 man or something and it really was just a fix.)</div></div><hr />

Anyone who can't be bothered to PUG a few 25 mans is seriously retarded and doesn't deserve to kill the LK in 1 week.<br />
<br />
Just because your guild doesn't have 25 raiders and you can't kill Blood Queen 25m doesn't mean you can't PUG the early bosses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LK 10-man was always intended to be killed by people only using loot obtainable in 10-man ICC or lower. Nobody should need to do 25-man content in order to do 10-man content, that's the entire point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
10m world of logs show that prenerf the spirits took 6.4m damage, and now it's only 5.2m, so I guess that means they no longer have like 900k hp and instead on the 700kish.<br />
<br />
Vile spirits pre-nerf had 5-6m, while post it was 3m+, so overall it seemed the frequency of casting, number of spawns and health made it half as hard.</div></div><hr />

Too bad, was just thinking of finishing up there and actually getting my achievements done after 3k gold worth of bracelet farming :P.<br />
Back to hand-on-hand combat farming it is.<br />
<br />
Might be wrong about this, found out that I couldn't get bracelets at all. Currently relogging to see if it was just a bug. (And yes I have my collector's kit on)<br />
<br />
Confirmed now, they stealth changed it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tribalwar</div><div class="date">2010-02-10, 08:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Tobias, my guild was able to do all of Ulduar with nothing but what we got from 10 man, we did have a few people including my self that did have a few pieces of 25 man stuff from just random pugs, but nothing extremely important. So yes if its 10 man, it should be done with the gear that is implemented in 10 man. Of course you will have people that will have ease because of the 25 man gear, and I won't say that it isn't a huge help, but yes this should and will be done with the gear that is included in the 10 man instance. We have gone pretty far threw ICC with the gear that has been dropped from there, and the gear that we have picked up threw the Frost badges, and Triumph. We are currently 7/12 bosses…<br />
So I think with they have done like I said in my prior post is that the LK was tuned so it can be done in 10 man.<br />
<br />
Also got to look at the guilds that downed the LK in one week pretty much have all 25 man gear, and these people haven't or just recently killed the LK in 25 man.<br />
<br />
Either way, when people get geared enough, and learn the encounters will help the progression of the guilds that are &quot;10 man&quot; only.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You make a good point. I guess before release they have a target number of guilds (especially the Strict guilds doing ICC 10 in the gear level it's designed for) who should be killing it on normal in the first week, and if the numbers don't match to their plans they make changes as soon as possible. If it's done that way I can understand why these changes happen.</div></div><hr />
