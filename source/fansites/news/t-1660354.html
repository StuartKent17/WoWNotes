Raid Finder Highmaul - Arcane Sanctum Bosses Missing Loot<br />
We wanted to let you know that we are aware of reports that neither Tectus nor Ko'ragh are dropping loot in the second wing of Highmaul. We are currently looking into those reports and hope to have the issue resolved as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
We're monitoring the situation and will provide details as they become available. <br />
<br />
Update<br />
It looks like we were able to implement a resolution for the issue that should allow any new instances of the raid to function correctly. Going forward bosses will drop loot normally.<br />
<br />
We are looking into possible resolutions for those impacted by the issue prior to the fix and will provide an update as soon as we know more. <br />
<br />
Update 2 12/17 6:30 pm<br />
We had hoped that we would be able to implement a resolution to those impacted by the earlier boss loot issue so that additional contact would not be necessary but unfortunately it seems that will not be possible.<br />
<br />
If you killed the first and/or third boss in the Arcane Sanctum (2nd Wing of Highmaul) this morning and did not receive any loot, neither gold nor items, please submit a ticket though our Support Site (https://battle.net/support/en/help/) and our In-Game Support staff will work to address the issue.<br />
<br />
Thank you all for your patience.<br />
<br />

<br />
Developer Commentary: We’re aware of excessive queue times for Heroic Dungeons. To help players have a better experience in Dungeon Finder, we’re expanding the rewards for Satchel of Savage Mysteries to award Heroic Dungeon loot in addition to the guaranteed Augment Rune, and a chance to contain a mount, Follower enhancement token, Battle Pet, or Battle-Stone. The satchel will remain Bind on Account and we'll continue to monitor Dungeon Finder queues and iterate as needed to ensure a great experience for everyone.<br />

Its RNG. Last number i saw quoted was 33% chance, which i'm dead on with 3 loots out of 9 bosses, however i may be wrong on the percentage.</div></div><hr />

They're trying to encourage hybrid classes to try healing/tanking on their way through. The chance for mounts/pets/etc. is the carrot for already-geared ones.</div></div><hr />

I guess it gives me some incentive to tank some heroics again, because i was thinking of getting some boomkin gear.<br />
But as you said that won't last very long. I'm not sure what else blizzard could really do to make it more worthwhile. Chance for savage blood maybe?</div></div><hr />

If it's any consolation, this will definitely make me run dungeons on my tank whenever there is a satchel up to be able to send gear to my mage who would otherwise queue for 5 hours. I think that's the point of this incentive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but I can now gear my dps alts by running my tank through the LFG quick queue.....so you get less dps and more tanks.<br />
<br />
Of course that only works when there are satchels available. I dont run instances unless there is a satchel for it.<br />
<br />
That said, the longest DPS queue I've had so far was 19mins.....so whilst not great, its not excessive....</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the main problem and adding worthless 630 gear is not going to fix it. There needs to be something of sufficient value for geared up tanks/healers to want to run a dungeon. 630 gear ain't it. I liked the suggestion above about Savage Bloods. I might actually tank some on my pally if that were the case. But that's a temporary stop gap as well. Bloods will only be worth what they are now for a short time. HC isn't that much more difficult than normal and when blackrock opens, it's going to put crafted gear even farther behind.<br />
<br />
If they put raid seals in there, that would shorten queue times I bet.</div></div><hr />
