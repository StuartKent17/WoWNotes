<br />
Character Boost and Class Trials<br />
Legion adds a Class Trial system that allows you to test out a character before deciding if you want to use a character boost on it. You can play through a short intro, the Broken Shore, and Artifact intro quest.<br />
<br />

<br />
Character Boost and Class Trials Available for Testing<br />
<br />
With the latest beta build, we’ve enabled the level 100 Boost and Class Trials experiences for Legion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Boosting a character to level 100 will place you into a short starting experience before you join in the Broken Shore experience. Class Trials will allow players to try various characters at level 100 as a part of a limited tutorial experience within the Broken Shore and allows players to play beyond the tutorial portion to experience the class through to acquiring their Artifact weapon. The short tutorial experience will focus on teaching many of the class’ core abilities. Players can apply a boost token at any time to keep the character they used during the Class Trial.<br />
<br />
For both the Boost experience and Class Trials, players will start with a pre-defined specialization that can be changed at a later point in time. Please note that due to the Demon Hunter not being eligible for Boosting, it will not have a Class Trial associated with it. <br />
<br />
For the beta test, we’ve adjusted the class trial restrictions so that players can use these characters for an extended duration.<br />
<br />

Patch 6.2.4 Hotfixes - June 17<br />

Brawler's Guild: Last Chance to Rumble...For Now<br />
Don't forget that the Brawler's Guild is going away in the Legion pre-expansion patch!<br />
With the patch coming to World of Warcraft before Legion, the organizers of the Brawler’s Guild will be temporarily closing their doors and going on a much-needed vacation. This means that you only have a few more weeks to experience strutting into the ring and standing alone against some of the greatest challenges ever faced by the champions of Azeroth. This is your time submit your fight card and show the crowd what you’re made of. Plan out your best strategies. You’re going to need them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Beta Character Copy - Updated 6/17<br />
Character Copy is currently enabled on the Beta realms. Once you login to the Beta realms, click the Copy Character button located under the &quot;Template Character&quot; button. <br />
<br />
The characters from your retail account should show up here; selecting one of them and clicking &quot;Copy&quot; will copy over a version of that character to the Beta Environment. If your Character List doesn't copy, make sure you have the proper region select and click &quot;Copy Account Data&quot;. Since this system requires gathering data from your live characters, it's possible that characters might not display if they have not been accessed for some time.<br />
<br />
Over the course of testing it may be necessary to disable Character Copy with little to no warning; we'll try to provide updates but please be aware the system will not always be online.<br />
<br />
Character Copy is currently not working on Beta Leveling Realm 03; cause is unknown at this point in time.<br />
<br />

Blue Posts<br />
Blood of Sargeras<br />
You will also see Blood of Sargeras from Disenchanting Rare and Epic items in a future beta build, as well as an increase in the cadence and quantity of Blood of Sargeras from Crafting World Quests in the Broken Isles. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/414636-lets-talk-about-blood-of-sargeras-being-bop/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20745065368?page=21#414))<br />

PvP Stat Templates<br />
I've mostly been testing warrior/rogue/DK, and when compared to out in the world, I lose nearly half my health when joining a BG but hit just as hard. Armor seems silly low. Sitting in Org, my warrior has 2361 armor, but only 590 in BGs. In my last BG, a lock said they only have like 450 armor.<br />
<br />
If stamina was doubled in the templates, and armor raised at least 3x, melee might not be so ridiculous. EG, if those 150k+ mortal strikes were brought down to 110k via more armor, and health pools were closer to 500k (as on live) than the current 220-250k health we see on PTR, it might not be so bad.<br />
This is helpful, thank you. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/414570-100-pvp-templates-need-more-stamina-and-armor/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20745186243?page=1#8))<br />

Frost Mage -- Legion Beta Feedback<br />
Thanks for all the feedback on Frozen Orb. There are some pretty significant changes coming next build that should address this (edit: as those of you watching the Q&amp;A stream with Watcher are hearing about just this moment, as it turns out). In particular, Frozen Orb will return to the role that it had in Warlords: a 60-second cooldown that you use for AoE or for a burst of Fingers procs, not a spell prompted by a rotational proc. We are adding a new single-target spell to fill the rotational role of interacting with the Brain Freeze proc.<br />
<br />
Note that the wording of Ice Floes was recently changed to specify &quot;cast time less than 10 seconds&quot;, to clarify that it's not intended to work with Ray of Frost. The gameplay of Ray of Frost is that it's a ramping damage burst that rewards you for anticipating when you can remain still for 10 seconds (or at least, 8 or 9 out of the next 10 seconds).<br />
<br />
This is nice to hear as far as concerns about Brain Freeze go, but I'm still worried all of the current issues with Orb are going to maintain just now we'll only have to deal with them once a minute. Will patiently wait to get to play with the build before complaining or anything, but I hope the actual core issues with Orb are going to be addressed in addition to this change.<br />
<br />
We will also be bringing Frozen Orb's Fingers of Frost chance up, and making it no longer speed back up after the first time it slows down.

PVP is the good stuff. Well, it's part of the good stuff. <br />
I actually fell in love with PVP after getting Ashkandi on my warrior and being dragged into battlegrounds by my raiding friends. There's nothing quite like chasing down people and pummeling them into oblivion, especially when it's on even footing and you eke out a victory against the same class in a 1v1 fight. <br />
<br />
I wish I had a Legion beta invite, the PVP changes and honor leveling system look really amazing to me.</div></div><hr />

There's nothing like being a discipline priest dragging 5 alliance all over your back while you carry their flag the length of the field to cap it. 3 times. Oh wait, that was BC. There's nothing like being an unkillable tree waving branches everywhere while someone tries to pummel you into oblivion just to pop those cooldowns to full health as I /lol at the poor soul that just started smashing their face into their keyboard. Oh wait, that was WotLK. There's nothing like a game that was never intended to have PvP to begin with, but shoehorned it in making it so there will never be any actual balance without screwing up the rest of the game.<br />
<br />
There are way better games out there for PvP. Hell, MTG is better for PvP than WoW will ever be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In Vanilla and TBC there were very powerful and useful profession crafting patterns/designs/weapons throughout the expansion. It seems like anymore professions are merely used as an inroductory way to get into raiding and then trails off to meaningless as the expansion goes on. Is there plans to add super hard to attain and super powerful crafting patterns like, say Arcanite reaper in Vanilla or Stormherald in TBC? Those weapons were hard to attain and powerful, felt good to use them. Maybe we could craft a legendary but it would be difficult but rewarding?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, and just think, by next expansion they'll likely have to be redone with all the class changes to come or else they scrap the system altogether making it only relevant for Legion.<br />

They could have just gone with speech bubbles and no audio. Probably cheaper and just as effective.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed. It's impressive both as OW is a new game and that its a different genre from LOL. That said, there's been some talk of LoL having a significant botting problem in Korea for some time. But I am not sure how serious it actually was.</div></div><hr />

The Chinese bubble which carried this film to financial prosperity is nearing collapse after a week. Shame, I was hoping that this film could be used as a reference point for future sequels on the dos and dont's in order to end with a more solid product both critically and financially but this may be it folks. Even the Launcher no longer has it as a splash screen and tv spots dried up quicker than rain drops in Phoenix.<br />
<br />
Chalk it up to another film swallowed by development hell. Hopefully there will at least be a Director's Cut which may give it the 'Kingdom of Heaven' treatment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In Vanilla and TBC there were very powerful and useful profession crafting patterns/designs/weapons throughout the expansion. It seems like anymore professions are merely used as an inroductory way to get into raiding and then trails off to meaningless as the expansion goes on. Is there plans to add super hard to attain and super powerful crafting patterns like, say Arcanite reaper in Vanilla or Stormherald in TBC? Those weapons were hard to attain and powerful, felt good to use them. Maybe we could craft a legendary but it would be difficult but rewarding?<br />
<br />
Doubtful. Their current vision for the game is getting all weapons through artificts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're going to Blizzcon, why would you go to a pre-show party with other people also going to Blizzcon?<br />
Because its a fun way to spend an evening in a town where you are most likely visiting. It automatically boots you into a space with people who you will have something to talk about and have some common ground with.<br />
<br />
When I was going to PAX, it was always fun to goto the pre and post show parties, met lots of people and had a good time.<br />
<br />
Why do you think it would be a &quot;cringe fest&quot;?</div></div><hr />

Best example are classes, talents and already available skills that are redone every expansion, shuffled around to feel fresh. It is actually both frustrating (re-learning own class every expansion) and boring (how many time same old skills can feel fresh just because some minor things about them changed) to have own class changed again and again. Instead of concentrating on going forward, accepting one solution (many worked for pve and pvp can be calibrated separately) they keep on going back. <br />
<br />
It feels like Blizzard is spending 60% of expansion making on maintenance and redoing of old concent than investing in new one...</div></div><hr />

That's happened to literally every movie, ever. Most people aren't interested in seeing a movie in theaters twice, and those that want to see it will do it within the first two weeks with most sales occurring on the opening weekend.</div></div><hr />

They even stated themselves once that the biggest reason people put down when quitting the game is &quot;everything changed&quot;. So they know full well when they revamp a bunch don't like it and quit yet they keep doing it. For no reason lol.</div></div><hr />

And if those exits are matched by new players without the emotional baggage, so much the better... Lol</div></div><hr />

That's the thing though, they've also stated the game barely has any new players. That's one issue they've had for a long time. Most of the sub increases were returning players. And yeah, those people probably weren't all that smart if some spell changes overwhelmed them so I don't really care. As a mythic raider I wouldn't run into them.</div></div><hr />
