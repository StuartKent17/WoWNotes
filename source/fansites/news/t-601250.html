Added updated epic faction rewards. I also changed the font I use to make screenshots of item tooltips, it should be a lot easier to read now. 
Screenshot of the new stats on Lady Vashj gloves, actually the change was here before today's patch but I forgot to post it ^^ 
Added major healing glow, not sure if I will do more items changes updates on armor" />

Added updated epic faction rewards. I also changed the font I use to make screenshots of item tooltips, it should be a lot easier to read now.<br />
Screenshot of the new stats on Lady Vashj gloves (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/may/crestfall.jpg), actually the change was here before today's patch but I forgot to post it ^^<br />
Added major healing glow, not sure if I will do more items changes updates on armor sets/heroic loots, they aren't complete for the moment and it's quite stupid to list tons of items without knowing if they changed or not (it would take for ever to check them one by one)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Christmas is early this year. New PTR patch changed items, a lot of items, and it's not finished !<br />
<br />
<br />
The current build has about a third of a soon-to-be very large number of item changes (nearly every level 70 epic item in the game is in the process of being updated). Don't base much off of what you see there this weekend.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rey</div><div class="date">2007-05-04, 04:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In most of the cases it's a very minor update isn't it ?<br />
<br />
I'm still not happy about the heroic rewards from the perspective of a priest.<br />
<br />
They'd do very well adding some gear for spirit bitches :D<br />
<br />
Anyways, step in the right direction, isn't it?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boubouille</div><div class="date">2007-05-04, 04:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not that minor since everything got buffed, +3 int +5 spell damage isn't much, but if it's on 10 slots of your equipment, it suddenly becomes a lot more interesting :p</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coldaan</div><div class="date">2007-05-04, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can understand that it's probably a lot of work to check every item if it was changed or not. nevertheless information about changes of items from karazhan and the 25-man raid instances are very welcome.^^<br />
<br />
PS: I checked atlasloot on the PTR and to me it seems like items from kara &amp; 25-man raids have not been changed.... yet.^^</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ex</div><div class="date">2007-05-04, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm interested to see if they are going to change the Tier 4 any. I'm highly irritated that my Dungeon set 3 gloves give me more AP, and more hit rating than my Tier 4 gloves. My Tier 4 gloves are a down grade outside of the +crit. Which I have to say is very annoying. <br />
<br />
My rogue still has green Bracers and a belt, and I've been zerging my LW for the Primal strike gear. which only seems to be a slight upgrade for the amount of work it is taking. Do you think they will be changing the primal strike gear any, or have you heard anything about it?<br />
<br />
Love the site, Its the only wow site I can still get to from work, Lucky me!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boubouille</div><div class="date">2007-05-04, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did a fast check on the PTR, Tier 4 Rogue set isn't changed yet</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rey</div><div class="date">2007-05-04, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice updates, love the new kara rings. Awesome stuff</div></div><hr />

They should buff the ones from Nightbane and Gruul tho. :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the updates! :)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coldaan</div><div class="date">2007-05-06, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't quite understand the original blue post.<br />
Does it mean that almost every lvl 70 epic is buffed for 2.1, or will it take longer than 2.1 to complete this?<br />
I hope my first guess is true.^^</div></div><hr />
