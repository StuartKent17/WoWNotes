Classic WoW Testing Schedule<br />
Beginning May 15, select WoW players will be invited to participate in a small-scale, focused closed beta test. Players will also get a chance to help put our servers and technology through their paces in a series of stress tests running from May through July—you can opt in now through Account Management and select the WoW Classic beta. Subsequent stress tests will extend the opportunity to even more players. Level caps will also be in place to ensure we’re emphasizing the “stress” in “stress test”<br />
<br />
—we want to push our tech to the limit, and that means a critical mass of players in close proximity.<br />
<br />
Stress Test Schedule*<br />
Stress Test 1: Wed May 22–Thurs May 23<br />
Stress Test 2: Wed Jun 19– Thurs Jun 20<br />
Stress Test 3: Thurs Jul 18– Fri July 19<br />
*Dates of each stress test are subject to change.<br />
<br />
To fill our pool of beta and stress test participants, we’ll be choosing dedicated players who meet select criteria from both the WoW Classic beta opt-in and the standard Warcraft beta opt-in. Participants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account. While opting-in to the beta is the primary way to make sure you’re in the running to join the test it doesn’t guarantee an invitation to the closed beta test. We may also consider additional factors such as how long a player has been subscribed to the game so that we have the right mix of players to ensure great feedback toward making WoW Classic the very best experience for the community.<br />
<br />
Create Your Character<br />
If you’re eager to claim your character name in WoW Classic, take note: we’ll be opening character creation on Tuesday, August 13.** Players with an active subscription or game time on their account will be able to create up to three characters per World of Warcraft account. We’ll have more information on realm names closer to launch, but rest assured—you’ll have plenty of time to figure out your plans for realm domination!<br />
<br />
*To align with other regions, the Americas will launch slightly ahead of August 27 in local time.<br />

Shocker.<br />
<br />
I'll never understand why the modern gaming era has this mentality. Back when I was young we all just got along. I mean console wars existed but it was very friendly.<br />
<br />
Nowadays something has to fail for the sake of it according to some vitriolic people.</div></div><hr />

The last 3 regular beta's you never needed game time.</div></div><hr />

Yes, Blizz actually stated that if you have a active wow subscription or game time you get Classic wow too, like a year ago..</div></div><hr />

<br />
I used to be that hyped but after the non-progressive itemization it kind of killed it for me. Blizzard have introduced item inbalances that did not exist at those raiding periods.<br />
<br />
I don't mind the 1.12 client as it's too much of a hassle to do otherwise. However, implementing progressive itemization is comparatively easy, even so that private servers implement and handle them very well.<br />
<br />
If all else fails, we'll at least have Star Citizen, right Bubby? :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly, no matter how folks will try to slice it Blizzard wins out in the long run.. More so since they will only have to go till the release of Naxx 40 and won't have to add anything new to classic..</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the live game. They said Classic would be included in a retail subscription.<br />
<br />
Not Beta access. Point to a source other than today's that said you needed the sub for Beta. You will not find one.<br />

they are to dumb to realize this. You can remaster a game, but not a feeling<br />

Beta is not meant to get free game play, its for testing stuff. Names reservation is not meant for players who aren't planning to play. It makes sense to require subscription. Subscription will be shared between Classic and BfA anyway.</div></div><hr />

Shocker.<br />
You have no leg to stand on here, buddy. After all, we have you and others throwing shade at Blizzard in a thread dedicated to how Blizzard is doing its best to create a better work environment for their employees. (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2483507-Blizzard-wants-to-cut-out-World-of-Warcraft-overwork-on-their-workers?p=51165710&amp;viewfull=1#post51165710)<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll never understand why the modern gaming era has this mentality.<br />
Simple. Take a good look in the mirror. People like you, hating on Blizzard at every single opportunity you get is the reason people have this attitude toward Classic and their more vocal supporters.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nowadays something has to fail for the sake of it according to some vitriolic people.<br />
Shocker coming from someone who all they do is spew vitriol at Blizzard, even when they do something right.</div></div><hr />

Very true, and it will be interesting to see how long it takes them to realize it.. I do have to laugh at those finding out that they need a sub to test beta, which if I remember right has always been a case since at least Burning Crusade, and probably vanilla beta before that..</div></div><hr />

It is pretty shitty.<br />

Most games either do free weekends, a one time buy in to Beta or just random invites regardless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True. ;)<br />
I bet people like Esfand and TipsOut will be among the very first to get access; even though they are private server players.<br />
I like both of them, it sets a false precedent, while on the other hand Blizzard bans and disinvites people like Preach for using some insignificant 'cheat' in their live game.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard knows the big classic draw is from working folks who can request days off from work for launch :D.<br />

They never actually said that about the Beta at all until today. Just the live release of the client.<br />
<br />
Could you play any beta test of any x-pac without sub? Seriously curious, I never beta tested.<br />

Really? The release date is the back-to-school week? FUUUUUUUUUUUUUU<br />

You can't see it that way because apparently Blizzard only releases anticipated stuff to fuck over the release of any competitor. So what game / x-pac comes out that day?</div></div><hr />

Well it's generally a bad time to release games at the beginning of summer, because that's where most people go on holidays and generally spend more time outside.<br />

And tbh teenagers probably aren't their core audience anymore.<br />

You're such a hypocrite dude. All you're ever doing on these forums is hating on WoW and hoping for it to fail (current version) even though you don't play it anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
another thing people fail to realize is that this is a throwback to vanilla. Its not a wow restart. You get classic and nothing more. You won't get new content, new updates etc, Game has a rather limited lifespan<br />
<br />
Imagine being too dumb to realize that maybe people aren’t chasing a feeling, and actually do just want to play vanilla. And literally nobody has ever said they expect updates or new content. The entire point and what people are expecting is the exact opposite. People want vanilla exactly as it was.</div></div><hr />

True!<br />
The gameplay of classic is so much different than retail now... anyone can argue about it as much as they want but they are wrong.<br />
<br />
Theres a reason why remastered games are successfull these days... the fact that classic was alot slower of a game overall, which some folk describe as &quot;tedious&quot;, is only good for its lifespan.<br />
As far as im aware the world fastest level 1-110 is like 5 hours, the world fastest 1-60 (years ago) is like 1 week real time. So when classic launches i can almost bet nobody is going to be level 60 by the end of the launch week... if someone is, congratz. But i highly doubt that... and also there are no gear catchup mechanics in classic, atleast to the point of retail. So its going to take months before majority of people are max level, if they dont quit before that.<br />
<br />
Only hardcore nolifers will be done with the content in less than 3 months... and we already know how small of a minority that group of people is going to be. Retail has been an example of it for decades.</div></div><hr />

Not Beta access. Point to a source other than today's that said you needed the sub for Beta. You will not find one.<br />

Eh, I having played them all.. yea i probably put classic above bfa... but it's still below wod. Wrath cata and mop had some of the best class game play ever, vanilla's class and spec game play was horrible, but it was better then what we had at the time.<br />
<br />
And I will never enjoy leveling... didn't enjoy it in Vanilla, don't enjoy it today, end game is the only part of the game I enjoy.</div></div><hr />

You've never had to be subbed for a single WoW beta. They not once stated you needed a sub for Classic WoWs beta.<br />

So awesome that the kiddies aren't going to all be online that first week.Uhh, I wouldn't count on that. In many parts of the US, the first day of school is the day after labor day. You will see plenty of kiddies online the first week.<br />

You are right, can’t create the feeling of playing for the first time. Only reason I’m playing Classic is because the first time around I focused on PVP only and this time I’m going to focus on PVE. <br />

<br />
God forbid people like different things and yeah, be excited for A classic version of WoW returning to a time when, and I can't stress this enough, some people thought it was an actually better game.<br />
<br />
The only thing I read there that I hate is that you need an active sub to have a hope of participating in the beta. Seems like a ploy to grab more MAU on their currently very weak core game, preying off people's hope for Classic.<br />

All that aside, when they announce it wasn't it supposed to be out in June?</div></div><hr />

Just let people enjoy stuff. If we could do it 20 years ago with Nintendo and Sega we can do it nowadays lol.<br />

Ironic how hypocritical you are. When it sometihng others like(example: retail wow) you want it to die but when it something you enjoy(classic wow) you say &quot;just let people enjoy stuff&quot;.<br />

I mean, what are you getting at here? I'd think it would be assumed pretty obviously that you'd need to subscribed to the game to be considered for the beta.<br />
<br />
Prior to this, an active account wasn't required for Alpha/Beta invites. (Source: Heroes of the Storm [Alpha], Cataclysm [Beta], Mists of Pandaria [Beta], Warlords of Draenor [Beta], Legion [Beta], and Battle for Azeroth [Beta]).<br />

Nope, it wasn't the case for any Beta (outside MoP case) if I remember correctly. It's kinda dick move from Blizzard, because they know many people are interested in Classic, but not in live stuff.<br />
<br />
My advice: if you are Classic (only) fan, don't fall for it. This Beta is not about testing game systems, but stability test. Also you could burn out before August, Classic is very time consuming game after all.</div></div><hr />

Such miserable wretches... It amazes me that some people still don't understand that plenty of players enjoy the Vanilla game play far more than the current version (and previous expansions) of the game. Sure, plenty of people only familiar with retail will try it, and plenty will hate it; that's ok. But there are thousands of people coming back to the game who haven't played in years due to one reason or another. People like me that hate how the game changed after BC/Wrath and is basically unrecognizable today.<br />
<br />
Stop crying if you only want to play retail. You can play it, others can play Classic. The enjoyment of the people playing the other version should have zero to do with you enjoying the version you choose to play. Classic doesn't have to fail for people to still enjoy retail and retail doesn't have to tank to prove that Classic is awesome.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sensa1</div><div class="date">2019-05-14, 11:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Requiring a subscription for Name Reservation is logical but requiring a subscription for the Beta isn't for 2 reasons:<br />
<br />
1) you didn't have to have an active subscription for other WoW betas;<br />
<br />
2) the % of active players who actually played Vanilla is likely less than 20% of the current player base. Beta testing Classic would be better done by people that actually played Classic.<br />
<br />
Part of the reason why an active subscription wasn't needed in other WoW betas was that they wanted to entice you back by letting you see how 'great&quot; the new expansion was. It's greedy and short sighted for them to exclude non-active subscriptions in this instance because the vast majority of the potential player base for Classic has been unsubscribed for a long time.<br />
<br />
This is the first Classic news, besides not getting the original AV, that has me bummed. Just goes to show you how desperate a state of affairs Retail WoW is in if they are forcing you to subscribe to have a chance at Beta for Classic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
another thing people fail to realize is that this is a throwback to vanilla. Its not a wow restart. You get classic and nothing more. You won't get new content, new updates etc, Game has a rather limited lifespan<br />
<br />
I think everyone understands these points, and are okay with it. <br />
<br />
It's their party, or will be in August. Let them have it. I have no interest in Classic, but who am I to pee on their parade?

because i am also passionate about the current game ? Not something that was released 15 years ago. Its not like im lurking in the classic forum or searching for classic news. They keep popping up everywhere.<br />

But honestly, so what? Let them talk. It's their game to support, not mine. If they're right, they're right. If they're wrong, they're wrong. <br />

It might be that I'm completely un-invested in anything Blizzard these days, but I honestly don't care, and I think there's enough people who honestly just want to try it, that I'm not gonna try and ruin it for them. I played classic, and enjoyed it. It's their turn. <br />

Playing this would get old... it's like getting stuck in the Barrens or Desolace when everyone else moved on. Also, the 40-man raids... Good luck getting a group together. I hope it's the build where priests wanding Onyxia (happened to me a lot lol) took agro from the tank...<br />
On top of that, you have to pay?? Can normal WoW subscribers automatically play in the Classic servers?<br />
<br />
It is pointless to discuss, as people liked that or didn't experience it. Some of these points to them are the core of an MMO. And I for example never had any real loot drama. Hard to get a group? That is well documented and people say they still prefer it over LFG because it helped build the community.<br />
<br />
It is discussed to death, so I wish people all the luck...but my memory is also quite fresh and I won't join.<br />
<br />
To your last question: The 15$ covers BOTH Classic and the current game. Ofc people don't say &quot;Nice, two for the price of one&quot; but rather find a way to complain.<br />

Nobody cares now, nobody will care then. For this to be successful it would have to launch DURING summer. Most of the people it's going to appeal to are in college, or work. Launching this when they AREN'T off? Stupid STUPID Blizzard.<br />

Can't wait till this company goes under and the devs and incompetent losers running the show are homeless and starving.<br />

What a charming person you are. You don't care, yet you wish bankruptcy and homelessness as well as starvation on people over the release of a 15 year old game, because you dislike the date of the release.<br />

No,thanks. I played that game 13 years ago,not going to pay a cent for the sake of nostalgia. I can't wait when the people,who didn't actually play the game at that time,will flood the forums with complaints about how difficult is the game.<br />

A) You think you want it, but you don't. After the initial rush, interest will die down and you are left with dead and empty servers<br />
B) Classic will have more players than retail, retail will shut down or if not, they will re-design retail to be more like Classic.<br />

<br />
You got it backwards. One of best thing about old WoW is there were no daily/weekly imaginary points to grind, no magical weekly chests to chase. You could play at your own pace. That makes it perfect for players who have limited time to play. No need to take time off work, no need to rush to max level. Play as slow as you want.<br />
<br />
Have some fun in summer, go outside.</div></div><hr />

Fully ack to your points, I would add, everyone who played classic, never want play it again. Isnt wasnt that much fun compared to today. If Blizz make it similar to classic, most give up after raiding BWL, if you really a hardcore guy, you'll realize the pain farming nature resil for AQ40, if this isn't enough for you, you will finally understand non of those guilds raiding Naxx, will ever accept the average player base, you need to be top. If Blizzard make it too easy, it isn't a real challenge and they damage all their (remaining) reputation, what will happen, 98% of all players will stop playing after BWL.<br />
<br />
Maybe I just play for a too long time, maybe I just can't see the fun playing classic :) <br />
<br />
If you want having this (a kind of) nostalgic feeling, just create on a test-account and lvl it to max.</div></div><hr />

Hm, nope. I've been given access to BFA alpha without active subscription. I clearly remember that, because I found it super funny. So yeah, I'm pretty sure it's just another attempt to improve numbers.

<br />
1. The sense of exploration was great in Classic but now that everyone has seen it, it's just going to be a fucking chore.<br />
<br />
2. Players will still have shitty looking shoulders, just now everything will be mismatched and ugly as fuck.<br />
<br />
3. The world isn't dangerous. It's simulated difficulty due to overtuning at lower levels.<br />
<br />
4. No. There were piles of shit-level groups all over the place. And then when it was a group of friends you joined and the group failed, you got your reputation shat on because people don't want to accept fault.<br />
<br />
5. No, he has a point. Loot drama was everywhere. Whether it was guildies giving out gear to their friends/significant others or people ninja-looting.<br />
<br />
And the bosses were briefly scary when they were current. Everyone knows the strats now. They won't be a challenge AT ALL. Player behavior matters to a degree but there were plenty of shitheads that would use their guild as a weapon to destroy the reputations of people they didn't like. I saw so many people get chased off servers for calling out guild leaders on favoring their girlfriend/boyfriend. Classic is 100% a &quot;You think you want it, but you don't.&quot; kind of thing.</div></div><hr />

I bet people like Esfand and TipsOut will be among the very first to get access; even though they are private server players.<br />
I like both of them, it sets a false precedent, while on the other hand Blizzard bans and disinvites people like Preach for using some insignificant 'cheat' in their live game.<br />
<br />
If you adress details you should also inform yourself properly. Esfand was banned 1.5 years ago and hasnt been using pserver footage since. Now everything is fine. Just as with Preach. If the summit would've been now he could attend.</div></div><hr />

I'll likely spin up a Classic character for nostalgia's sake, taking in the old world and doing quests and taking in storylines I can't anymore in the Retail version of WoW. It'll be great to have both options, and there's no real need to fight over which is better - it's a subjective thing, a matter of personal taste.

I think it just shows how passionate the majority are for Classic.<br />
<br />
Something you rarely see with current WoW these days.<br />
<br />
People will still take time off for this - I may myself. The fact that it's not going to be the levelling speed we have got used to wont change anything. The difference will be that you wont get to lvl60 in a day (im guessing 20-30 maybe? - but its been a loooooong time since I played vanilla obviously and of course it was new to me then so will be interested to see).<br />
<br />
Personally I will likely take a day off - but maybe not launch day to make sure I dont take a day off only to be greeted with server crashes! Ill then enjoy the story but also see how far I can level in a day - just to see the comparison. I may actually do a &quot;day in live WoW without any heirloom buffs&quot; and then a &quot;day in classic&quot; just to see the difference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll be very surprised if they will be empty..... There wont be nearly as many classic servers as live servers and I strongly suspect there will be four types of players on them:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Dedicated hard-core classic fans (who will be frustrated with things they see as not true to vanilla - but will still play regularly).<br />
Players who want to play again what they played years ago - many of these will level a bit or even up to 60 and maybe raid a bit - but then will move on to something else - but many of these will still come back every so often for their &quot;fix&quot;<br />
Players who never played vanilla and want to see what it's about. I don't expect many of these to be dedicated classic players - but some will likely. Most will try it and decide its too slow progress and give up - but that's fine they will have at least seen what it's about.<br />
Players who want to go to classic just to find fault with it. most of these will only log in a few times and can pretty much be ignored as irrelevant.<br />
<br />
<br />
Of these player types - with the lower number of servers and the combination of players who log in occasionally and the dedicated players there will likely still be plenty of players to keep a limited number of servers up and running.<br />
<br />
What I do expect may happen is to merge some servers after its been up and running a year or two and the number of players more closely represented once the &quot;gimmick&quot; of it dies down.</div></div><hr />

I'll be very surprised if they will be empty..... There wont be nearly as many classic servers as live servers and I strongly suspect there will be four types of players on them:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Dedicated hard-core classic fans (who will be frustrated with things they see as not true to vanilla - but will still play regularly).<br />
Players who want to play again what they played years ago - many of these will level a bit or even up to 60 and maybe raid a bit - but then will move on to something else - but many of these will still come back every so often for their &quot;fix&quot;<br />
Players who never played vanilla and want to see what it's about. I don't expect many of these to be dedicated classic players - but some will likely. Most will try it and decide its too slow progress and give up - but that's fine they will have at least seen what it's about.<br />
Players who want to go to classic just to find fault with it. most of these will only log in a few times and can pretty much be ignored as irrelevant.<br />
<br />
<br />
Of these player types - with the lower number of servers and the combination of players who log in occasionally and the dedicated players there will likely still be plenty of players to keep a limited number of servers up and running.<br />
<br />
What I do expect may happen is to merge some servers after its been up and running a year or two and the number of players more closely represented once the &quot;gimmick&quot; of it dies down.<br />
<br />
It will probably be like OSRS; the games still quite alive when the average people online at a time is only like 80k.</div></div><hr />

The people coming here and saying &quot;Oh classic will fail, You losers suck, Blah blah blah, I'm a scared little kid over the internet.&quot; are just hating to hate. I would say they are people in mama's basement, but with some of their spelling? They make me think they are 12 year olds. While, I am not looking forward to classic, just because I honestly never liked Vanillas class design. I will try it to get away from Retail fora little.</div></div><hr />

Some companies, including the one I work for use 00:01 to signal a new day and 00:00 to mean the previous day. I didn't write a post to ask how a clock works thank you.</div></div><hr />

Wrath cata and mop had some of the best class game play ever, vanilla's class and spec game play was horrible, but it was better then what we had at the time.<br />
<br />
And I will never enjoy leveling... didn't enjoy it in Vanilla, don't enjoy it today, end game is the only part of the game I enjoy.<br />
<br />
How can you claim wod had good class design? it was literally the era of homogenization... every class had everything so there was no class prestige and the only thing you had going for your class was different animations and lore perspective.<br />
This all began in Wotlk and continued up to legion when they started focusing on class fantasy more.<br />
<br />
DPS rotation and gameplay pretty much was identical to every class and spec between cata-wod. The FEEL of the gameplay wasnt any different between casters nor were they any different between melee classes, even if you had 2 hander compared to dualwielding.<br />
I tried maining enhancement shaman in wod and the things that made the spec special were not even part of the main damage in raids... windfury for example did a total of 3% of my total damage in a boss fight. Where as in vanilla the main damage component for enhancement was windfury, that was its prestige that no other class had. (not that they were dpsing in raids back then but the class-prestige was there)<br />
<br />
Class fantasy/gameplay is not only about raid dps rotation... thats elitist talk. The real fantasy what people care about is what you have/can do that other classes dont have/cant do.<br />
<br />
Its only your problem if you dont enjoy leveling... thats a huge part of the game. <br />
Personally I usually dont play a game if i dont enjoy it for the first 5 mins... i dont like wasting my time before getting to the fun part so if i didnt like leveling i wouldnt even play WoW... luckily i do, just not in BFA (or cataclysm tbh) since its way too easy and has no challenge unless i handicap myself.<br />
Thats why over the years people have developed the mental attitude about fun starting at max level, in a way its true but its nowhere near black and white/yes or no when it comes to classic. <br />
In BFA its pretty much true... but then again its a different game.</div></div><hr />

Don't know where you got WoD class game play being good... there's a period there: &quot;but it's still below wod. Wrath cata and mop had some of the best class game play ever&quot;<br />
<br />
And I played day one til the end of vanilla, leveling was never the fun part for me... ever, it was doing Raids, it was doing dungeons, it was getting awesome items like Benediction and Rhok, it was all the end game stuff.<br />
<br />
I did have 6 or 7 60s though, I'm just really good at slogging through shit to get to the fun part.</div></div><hr />

You drew two different sentences out of context. I wrote,that there are two groups of people - the ones,who are complaining,that some crappy private realm was closed and those,who are simply nostalgic about the game,though have forgotten what was it really like back then. I also wrote,that there are people,who don't understand (because they didn't play the game back then) or have forgotten (because they didn't play that version of the game for more than a decade) what it really took back then to raid - not a single word about a private realm players.<br />
<br />
Now,because of the fact,that you are uncapable to read a post properly and are capable only to draw the line between two sentences you saw in whole text,ignoring the other facts stated in it,thus making some kind of silly assumptions,you think,that you have a right to call me brain damaged?

Nice bullshit posturing, but that's just for show. Let's requote your post to get the context you're pretending was ignored :<br />
<br />
<br />
What did I miss exactly? The fact,that there was a bunch of people,who were playing on a private server,which was closed,and who went on to whine on the Blizzard forums,demanding an old version of a game? Or the fact,that there's a bunch of people,who think,that if they will start playing vanilla again today,it will all be the same as back - despite the fact,that a memory tends to portray things in a brighter light,than they actually were?<br />
<br />
People seriously don't understand or have forgotten what it's like,when you really need 40 guild members for the raid,which takes 5-6 hours to clean or how stupid it's to grind a materials for hours only to craft idiotic resistance gear. <br />
First paragraph speak of two different groups of people, true.<br />
Then second paragraph claim that &quot;people&quot; in general &quot;don't understand or have forgotten [what Vanilla is like]&quot;. It very clearly doesn't make a distinction nor apply to a specific group, so all your BS falls flat and you're doing literally what I called you on about, which is to argue about private server in one hand, and then claiming that people &quot;don't know what Vanilla was like&quot;.<br />
<br />
You try to claim I'm &quot;uncapable&quot;(sic) to read, but it seems clear it's rather you're either of plain bad faith, caught being wrong and trying to deflect over to me, or actually are the one incapable of writing correctly, because your justifications simply don't match what you actually wrote.<br />
<br />
Who the hell you think you are?<br />
Someone who isn't brain damaged.<br />
<br />
Many people know very well what Vanilla is like, and THAT IS PRECISELY WHY THEY LIKE IT. Some people actually have pretty good memory and can remember, and many others have had private servers to get a refresher.<br />
Not everyone will like Vanilla, but many will.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just imo this wouldn't be happening to begin with if it weren't for the whiners whining about how it wasn't fair that other people had such better gear than they did, because they couldn't put as much time in the game to get the gear. So Blizzard started changing the game to make the crybabies happier. This isn't the fault of the Classic fans. If Blizzard wouldn't have catered to them in the first place, WoW would still be the game us Classic fans love. And on that note, once Classic does come out, if people start complaining that it's too hard, I hope Blizzard tells them to play the Retail version then!!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
And at that time, they can just go back to Retail WoW where they will get pretty much everything handed to them, with hardly any effort on their part!!!<br />

So Blizzard started changing the game to make the crybabies happier. This isn't the fault of the Classic fans. If Blizzard wouldn't have catered to them in the first place, WoW would still be the game us Classic fans love. And on that note, once Classic does come out, if people start complaining that it's too hard, I hope Blizzard tells them to play the Retail version then!!!!<br />
<br />
I don't see how is that a flaw? They improved the game so it can be accessible to more people. If you can spend 15 hours per day 15 years later for classic, nice I guess but I don't want to know what kind of life you are leading 15 years later when you have 15 hours per day to play games.</div></div><hr />

Wish blizzard would just switch to military time (24 hour clock) would make it easier for people world wide.[/QUOTE<br />

<br />
Some companies, including the one I work for use 00:01 to signal a new day and 00:00 to mean the previous day. I didn't write a post to ask how a clock works thank you.<br />
<br />
Well... I am sorry that your company uses a clock wrong. I have never known a company use 0000 to mark the same day, and 0001 is the start of a new day. New years eve must be a weird one for your company. I'll be honest, I just think you didn't know how 24 hour clocks worked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are really bad at reading comprehension. I said i do not play retail or classic i never said i do not care about retail theres a difference.<br />
<br />
I actually do not care about Classic however i do care about retail however the classes i play design wise feel so bad to play that i cannot bring myself to continue playing it.</div></div><hr />
