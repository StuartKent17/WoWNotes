Shadowmourne is not for hunters! 
Turns out that Shadowmourne for hunters was another misinterpreted joke from Blizzard. (Don't blame it on me, it even was in the official recap of the panel!) 
Anyone capable of using a two-handed axe can use Shadowmourne. 
 
The stat allocation may not benefit hunters or shamans as much as warriors, DKs or paladins.

There is NO Cataclysm Beta for the moment<br />
The first Cataclysm beta scam reached my mail today, time for a small warning.<br />
As always, when there is a beta, we will announce it. Please be wary of any and all claims of a beta or alpha for the new expansion being held. <br />

Blue posts<br />
Stats simplification<br />
What we were finding is that in many cases things had just become so complicated that players were not making intelligent decisions based on their knowledge of how various stats benefited them. That sounds like what you wanted to have happened, but it really wasn't. Instead players would pull up a BiS list, or plug the item into a spreadsheet. If the answer was &quot;upgrade&quot; they equipped the item. We could pretty much just give the items a name and art and make all the stats not displayed.<br />
<br />
If you were one of those players who picked up a piece and understood how armor pen vs. attack power benefited you or whether defense was still worth collecting after you had hit crit immunity, then you were in the minority. Hopefully we can get back to a system where eyeballing an item's stats has some chance of being right. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/19378792832-i-do-not-want-player-stats-simplified.html))<br />
<br />
Guild Leveling System<br />
Guild advancement is based on the performance of the top 20 producers within the guild. If you have a small guild of 20 (or less), then every person's contributions will count. <br />
<br />
[...] If you have some down days, it's not going to affect the guild progress adversely. If you have great days, you'll be up at the top. Keep in mind, this is a great way to not penalize large guilds for having a lot of members and it's also a great way for small guilds to not feel as if they need to mass recruit to keep up with the larger guilds both. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/19377464491-small-guilds-being-shut-out.html))<br />
<br />
No new classes for Draeneis<br />
We didn't set out to slight the draenei. As I said on the first panel, we just didn't think any of the missing classes fit them. <br />
<br />
[...] While we picked some race/class combinations that were on the edgier side of things, that does not give credence to all potential race/class combinations. Draenei have a very well-rounded complement of class selections as it is, and none of the remaining classes are where we want to take the story at this time. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/19378793800-draenei-all-back-of-the-bus.html))<br />
<br />
Terrain changes in old zones<br />
The terrain is not guaranteed to change in every zone, many zones are likely going to stay the same terrain-wise but the questing will get the clean up. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/19377974222-blizzard-getting-lazy.html))<br />
<br />
Reforging<br />
It's too early to go into a lot of detail on the new features, but the basic idea here was to make an undesirable drop possibly more desirable. It still shouldn't compete with gear that is actually itemized for you.<br />
<br />
As an example, letting someone turn stamina into a dps stat is something we'd be unlikely to do (or at least impose a lot of restrictions) since that lets you turn an undesirable stat for most characters into something good.<br />
<br />
Think of reforging more as a consolation prize or as a way to work around things like hit caps, and not the kind of thing that clever players are going to be able to use to vastly min max their character power. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19377454350-reforging.html))<br />
<br />
Leveling easier in low level zones after the revamp<br />
Yes, there are technically fewer brand new zones and fewer levels to level up through - but - in return for this there is a much cleaner leveling experience from start to finish and many other things. Think of it like this, would you rather have this cleaner leveling system, the guild leveling system, and the new path of the titans max-level progression system or more zones/dungeons to level up through?<br />
<br />
We want to hear your thoughts on things especially since we are doing something very different this expansion, but if things don't become constructive the thread will be locked. <br />
<br />
Cleaner leveling system? Are you referring to how the zones are being redone (i.e. Lordaeron zone level revamp)? <br />
Yes. The new system will avoid requiring you to run back and forth between continents to find the right quests to do. Instead there will be a natural flow all the way through. <br />
<br />
Also, are you guys going to increase the speed of leveling again, or is that remaining constant? <br />
Hard to say, just making the system flow better will probably speed it up, but I am not sure that the actual number of experience points needed will change. <br />
<br />
And with that in mind, lets say I roll an undead. What incentive do we have to explore say, Kalimdor? If I am a newbie starting out, and I can do everything by skipping along zone to zone in sight of the Undercity, doesn't that kinda kill the whole &quot;big world&quot; feel?<br />
This goes into the &quot;your choice&quot; category. Would you prefer to hit all the zones in Eastern Kingdoms like Arathi Highlands and both of the Plaguelands or swing over to see what has happened in Stonetalon Mountains and Desolace? You can enjoy one area with one character and then hit the others on another too. We like the idea of giving players more options. <br />

Treants<br />
Treants do fine damage, but it's not terribly exciting. It's nothing that couldn't be accomplished by a spell that just did damage instead. The water elemental (less so the other elementals) and the shaman wolves are more interesting temp pets.

Daggers<br />
We drop daggers in raids. The only people who are super interested in them are Assassination rogues, but they have fallen behind Combat. We might boost Assassination without buffing its burst. Probably not through a new talent. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19377463252-we-want-rogues-to-use-daggers-this-a-joke.html))</div></div><hr />

Tauren would certainly look strange on an armored charger, wouldn't they? We're keeping this in mind. You'll see. ;) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/19377464368-tauren-pally-mount.html))<br />

What exactly about the Lich King says &quot;Hunter&quot;? The man is a giant, muscular, plate wearing, Death Knight. If he dropped any weapon it would be for Warriors, Death Knights, and Ret Paladins. Just because you can use a certain type of weapon doesn't mean it's for your class. The caster legendary next expansion will be either a Dagger, Sword, or Staff, all which Hunters can use. Of course those special people are going to assume once again, that Hunters can use it!</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]: Warriors and Rogues<br />
2) [Warglaive of Azzinoth]: Warriors and Rogues<br />
3) [Thori'dal, the Stars' Fury]: Hunters, Rogues, Warriors (basicly everyone who can learn the bow skill)<br />
4) [Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian] : Staff from Naxx40 this was both for ranged as for healers<br />
5) [Val'anyr, Hammer of Ancient Kings]: One-handed mace wielded by priests, druids, paladins and shaman<br />
6) [Shadowmourne]: 2h axe for Warriors, DK's and Paladins<br />
7) [Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros]: 2h MELEE mace (probably any class who can use 2h maces could wear this)<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
Melee Legendary's: 5 (Last Legendary: Black Temple or Sunwell Plateau)<br />
Ranged Legendary's: 1 (Last Legendary: Naxx40!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)<br />
Healer Legendary's: 2 (Last Legendary: Ulduar)<br />
<br />
So why the f*ck does blizzard release more melee legendaries than any other?<br />
Now Blizzard mentioned a 'ranged' legendary is coming with the expansion, I was like &quot;FINALLY, Did it take you more than 3 years to realise that maybe just MAYBE ranged deserve a legendary?<br />

Aside from that, why do people keep harping on these things like people are doing NBG in raids?! Casual non-raiders aren't going to be rolling against you for your phat lewtz... If the Raid Leader (or Guild Leader) lets a hunter go for a legendary drop for the stats, take it up with them...there's an inherent problem with the leadership of the guild in that case.

It depends on the procc, &quot;all&quot; legendarys have had some kind off procc.<br />
And I think the best player in the guild should have it if he can use it (and wants it), if a guild give the first one to a hunter then he prob deserved it.</div></div><hr />

Healer and caster deepz get forgotten about when it comes to Legendary weapons? Why is this? And when you do add an up to date healer legendary it requires 30 fragments to get? Melee legendaries are often drops... Warglaives.... There are more melee legendaries than healer and ranged put together. <br />

The is only 1 Legendary for Casters and that's the only Legendary you can't get anymore. And they pump out one more Legendary for Melee.... ..... ......<br />
<br />
One more thought to Shadowmourne... What if it is not actually Frostmourne but another weapon, one Arthas had forged for one of his champions, namely one who used an axe in life... like... Saurfang the Younger?<br />
<br />
I really wish they'd implement a Caster Legendary again. I'd just like to have something to aspire to. Even if I never got the Legendary, it'd be a goal, something awesome to look forward to. Also, I'd hope it'd be done like the Twin Blades and the Bow, or like Thunderfury. The system Val'Anyr uses pretty much garanties only 1 person in the raid will have the Legendary. We got one druid working on it from week 1 of Ulduar and he's still about 5 fragments short. On the other hand, if you are lucky in that same time 2 or more people in the raid could have the Twin Blades.<br />
<br />
Now you can decide whether that's good or a bad thing.<br />
<br />
Actually I like the way Thunderfury was done best. A drop so multiple people can get it, but also a lengthy epic questline.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cryogenic</div><div class="date">2009-08-24, 09:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's totally a hunter weapon ;)<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
True, me too I play a warlock and getting yourself geared, as a ranged, is MUCH harder!<br />
<br />
In what dream.<br />
There is that much more cloth spell power across the loot tables then the likes of melee plate its not funny, whether that piece of loot then actually is of use to that spec or whether its lathered with a horrible stat for them is another story.<br />
<br />
The more typical answer to the likes of you should be, you clearly don't know about melee your weapons have less impact on your dps then melee weapons do and most of all your a candy ass that stand 30 to 40 yards away from a boss and clicks icons gets away with keyboard turning and thinks they have it tough.<br />
so your legendary had 37 more sp and a weak trinket effect or so like the healing mace compare that to a boost in weapon dps or a slower speed of swing for melee and the boost is miles apart...<br />
<br />
What bearing do lvl 60 items have right now, absolutely none why is it even an argument? because you think it should be, I've played every class going and the pure dps don't need legendaries to outperform these hybrids and a legendary axe will help with the output difference</div></div><hr />

What's the use, especially if it involves hard mode Arthas kills it will mean Shadowmourne will only be available once you have cleared all content and can only use it to farm gear for other . . . Same as Atiesh same as Thor'idal. Thunderfury and the glaives saw a lot of use. Casters should be happy they are getting a legendary in cata on an early tier raid. That means you invest effort into getting something you will actually use for a long while and not just get for vanity status.</div></div><hr />

I just think that legendaries should be placed on middle tier raids (like they should have made Frostfathom drop from Vashj giving hunters a legendary lore bow instead of a madeup for it's instance legendary with no history), and be designed so as to stay BiS within the xpac they are released in (maybe last tier hard mode items should surpass them in stats) and have an interesting but not gamebreaking proc (like the glaives which had a gamebreaking proc since brutallus died oh so much easier the more glaive sets your raid had).</div></div><hr />

ICC maybe not, since it's probably the end raid of WOTLK like BT/Sunwell were for BC (and both dropped legendaries) but them announcing a Caster DPS legendary in first raid of Cataclysm makes me believe it might not drop only on 25man version raids (at least I hope so).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because melee plan on using it as opposed to nicking people in the shins.<br />
<br />
As for stat complication, im sure it also works to make items easier to create. Think about, they released untold peices of gear in Ulduar and Coliseum alone, you simplify the stats, you make it better for all class, and better for them, so they dont have to create so many peices of gear just to add variety.</div></div><hr />

WoW looting involving hunters has a long history.<br />
You don't joke about hunters being denied loot because it is 'not their main-weapon'.<br />

<br />
melee is FARRR superior to caster.. As a warlock I always have to outroll 7 other classes on items. 70% of all lichking drops is plate. PVP is nonsense because of lichking and people prefer melee people in group then casters.<br />
<br />
<br />
PLATE CLASSES DON'T HAVE COMPETITION ON GEAR EITHER GUYS LOLOLOL. Shut the fuck up.<br />
<br />
Warlocks have competition against Mages, Shadow Priests, other Warlocks, and on some pieces (not all) against Elemental Shamans, and in some cases Boomkins.<br />
<br />
Plate wearers have competition against Warriors, Death Knights, Ret Paladins, and sometimes against Hunters and Rogues on Weapons (Depending on Class/Spec).<br />
<br />
Cloth DPS and Plate DPS both have equal amounts of classes to compete against on gear. As you can see both Cloth and Plate DPS both have 3 races they will be guaranteed to roll against and two exceptions (IE classes that can benefit from the same proficiency but don't prioritize it.)<br />
<br />
Where the fuck did you come out of the blue saying you had 7 different classes to compete against gear on? There's only 3 cloth wearing classes, did you fucking smoke a bowl before you posted?<br />
<br />
And where the fuck did you pull out that bullshit where 70% of Wraths drops are plate LOL? Way to make up a random number off the top of your head. Gear proficiency is spread out pretty well. Most bosses drop 1 piece of gear for each spec on 25's. Show me a boss where 18 of the 25 drops are Plate DPS. Fucking retard.<br />
<br />
I still can't believe you said you have to roll against 7 different classes. It's almost unfathomable to imagine how retarded you are. Assuming you're not rolling against plate wearers that means you're rolling against other Warlocks, all specs of Priests (Healing gear and DPS gear have different itemizing FYI,) Mages, Shamans, Hunters, Rogues and Druids. Yeah. All those hunters need spirit so they have to go into Aspect of the Viper less often. Oh and those Bandage specced rogues, FUCK YES.<br />
<br />
And how the fuck did Wrath destroy PvP loot distribution? You get the gear on your own through grinding honor. You don't have competition for PvP gear unless you're talking about Vault, which isn't required to get a full set of PvP gear, so if you wanted you'd never have to compete against others for a set of PvP gear. And the loot out of Vault is random, you're probably whining because you've had bad luck with random loot. But from the look of your post it seems that you don't deserve the loot to begin with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Just because &quot;everything is a melee weapon&quot; doesn't mean melee will use it. Have you seen a Shard of Val'anyr ever go to a melee oriented class to be seriously used as an upgrade? No, because it's not itemized for Melee DPS. Your arguement is completely irrelevant. Yes, melee have gotten their fair share of legendaries, but your arguement is flawed. Just because melee can learn the item proficiency it doesn't make it a melee weapon.</div></div><hr />

Daggers<br />
We drop daggers in raids. The only people who are super interested in them are Assassination rogues, but they have fallen behind Combat. We might boost Assassination without buffing its burst. Probably not through a new talent. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19377463252-we-want-rogues-to-use-daggers-this-a-joke.html))<br />
<br />
Makes the HfB an ability that could be purged or &quot;cured&quot;, then the rogue would lost his mind standing on the ground doing nothing, it prevents HfB being used in PvP..<br />
So? It's time to buff HfB to increase damage done by 50%!<br />

Val'anyr is right before Cataclysm? Wha? You do know that Ulduar is the 2nd of four raids released in Wrath, and the 3rd tier of the expansion is freshly released, and the 4th is still in developement. Cataclysm is also still in developement, and we'll still have a few months before we see Icecrown, and then we'll have a waiting period before Cataclysm.

<br />
They won't QQ because it will have an absurd amount of DPS and top end damage. That's all any melee cares about on a melee weapon. Why do you think you see warriors running around with weapons like Betrayer (Pre Ulduar) and Rune Edge? Shit, they could have made this a weapon itemized for Hunters with agility and attack power but slapped on 312 DPS and I don't think you'd see any melee bitch about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So why the f*ck does blizzard release more melee legendaries than any other?<br />
Now Blizzard mentioned a 'ranged' legendary is coming with the expansion, I was like &quot;FINALLY, Did it take you more than 3 years to realise that maybe just MAYBE ranged deserve a legendary?<br />
<br />
Anyway comment..<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah go ahead and complain about not having a caster legendary when your list doesnt have anything for enhancement shamans and only one thing for feral druids and it sucked for them at the time. <br />
People will probably aruge that enhancement shamans can equip Sulfuras Hand of Ragnaros but by that logic Mages and warlocks can equip Thunderfury so dps casters have 2 legendarys. <br />
The fact is any enhancement shaman who actualy got in a raid pre-bc because they wanted the totems and couldnt *find a resto or ele for group 5 would be kicked from thier guild for trying to roll on The Eye of Sulfuras. and Im sure my guild would be thrilled if I aruged that I should get Shadowmorne. In BC they finaly added a dual wield legendary and they made it swords.</div></div><hr />

wouldnt be a bad idea imo,that would totally seperate pve and pvp more than what they are,i mean in pvp you ASSASSINATE a fellow player therefore big burst dmg then dissapear into the shadows again but in pve you are in COMBAT with a boss,you cant stun cc a boss like you can a fellow player,so giving us a viable combat dagger spec would be a very nice addition indeed</div></div><hr />

Yes, there are technically fewer brand new zones and fewer levels to level up through - but - in return for this there is a much cleaner leveling experience from start to finish and many other things. Think of it like this, would you rather have this cleaner leveling system, the guild leveling system, and the new path of the titans max-level progression system or more zones/dungeons to level up through?<br />

However i must say this,the best thing blizz is doing is finally fixing the hunter class to how it should be,mana and hunters has always just been kinda silly.<br />
Only mana using class in the game that has no way of healing themselves (yes mage can glyph for evocate and heal back 60% of hp,in before the uneducated post)<br />
So with that said,there will be one class extremely happy come Cataclysm (woot hunters) while the rest cry and complain how their class still sucks and needs fixed (after the honeymoon of race/faction change of course)<br />

You'd only succeed in pissing off the Mut rogues who can no longer run in raids, and therefore have to regem, rechant, respec, etc to go into Combat. Not every Mut rogue loves PvP, in case you weren't aware. Also, fix'd your post for you.<br />

<br />
Not so much impractical as whine-inspiring... Every major talent change patch/expansion has seena shift in which tree was better for what...especially hunters, but also rogues for which tree was best for dps (non-pvp). It's not anything new, nor anything unexpected, and hardly impractical, when all is said and done. By the time the expansion is a week old, there'll be breakdowns on EJ with just which build ekes out the best dps and with what gear, weapons, gems, and glyphs...just like always.<br />
<br />
People will level while they hammer out the details, then everyone who raids (hardcore or main focus) or wants to be &quot;uber leet&quot; will hit their site, and make their list so they can all be clones. Absolutely nothing at all new or impractical.</div></div><hr />

Guild advancement is based on the performance of the top 20 producers within the guild. If you have a small guild of 20 (or less), then every person's contributions will count.<br />
<br />
[...] If you have some down days, it's not going to affect the guild progress adversely. If you have great days, you'll be up at the top. Keep in mind, this is a great way to not penalize large guilds for having a lot of members and it's also a great way for small guilds to not feel as if they need to mass recruit to keep up with the larger guilds both.<br />

<br />
<br />
Yeah, they have a lot of Lore being chased by demons/the Legion to get killed or worse, converted to demons. Draenei warlocks would not be like other races' warlocks, still rather normal members of their race dabbling with fel magic, no, they'd be man'ari Eredar (http://www.wowwiki.com/Man%27ari_eredar). For other races, the analogies would be &quot;fel orcs, naga, undead, felblood elves, Wretched, and satyr&quot; (WoWWiki (http://www.wowwiki.com/Man%27ari#Note_on_naming)) and none of those are accepted in their original societies.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skyshatter</div><div class="date">2009-08-26, 12:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason WoW is heavy on melee legendaries is because the weapons themselves are &quot;legendary&quot; in nature. How man wizards are known for their staffs by name? Thor had Mjolnir and I've never read a single Forgotten Realms book and I can tell you that Drizzt's swords are Twinkle and Icingdeath. Aragorn had Anduril, Frodo = Sting. What was Merlin's staff's name? I dunno, but Arthur's sword was called Excalibur. The reason is because melee actually use their weapons instead of having a finely crafted stat stick. I'm not saying casters shouldn't get one, but the weapon is more iconic for the melee, with a few exceptions like Atiesh for Medivh. <br />
As for the comments about it being Pally, DK, Warrior, that is incorrect. I'm a ret paladin and I wish it were so, but Blizzard said that anyone who can use a 2H axe can use the legendary although the stats may not be as beneficial to them as other classes ie. Hunters/Shaman. And lol at the fury warriors going &quot;is it unique? i want two&quot;. If such bad spec gets two legendary axes, I'll eat my keyboard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I'm a Ret' Paladin, and according to Ghostcrawler, it seems as though it may be so. It's, eh... pretty concise, if you ask me.<br />
<br />
Shadowmourne is not for hunters!<br />
Turns out that Shadowmourne for hunters (and Shammies, as stated) was another misinterpreted joke from Blizzard. (Don't blame it on me, it even was in the official recap of the panel!)<br />
Anyone capable of using a two-handed axe can use Shadowmourne.<br />
<br />
The stat allocation may not benefit hunters or shamans as much as warriors, DKs or paladins. <br />
<br />
Generally implying it'll either be:<br />
<br />
A) A massive stat'-wrench (figure), maintaining a large table that all three of us (DKs, Warriors and Ret's) may sit at, finding--to our collective delight--a weapon imbued with reasonable stat'-values, catering to all our needs at once (E.G., ArP, a stat from which Ret's don't stand to benefit much), which has been the nature of every other Legendary conceived thus far, with the exclusion of Val'anyr, or;<br />
<br />
<br />
B) Be more linear, and wind up catering to whomever picks it up (quest-line that actually involves [reforging] Frostmourne, perhaps), based on class, spec', etc. That would address the issues Tank-Knights have, as there are presently no weapons available in the game that provide them stat's their performance would benefit.<br />
<br />
In either case, as it has been stated it won't be catered out to the two lesser melee classes (Hunters are generally ranged, and Shamans don't benefit from higher-melee class-particular stats), and granted the nature of the weapon, and whatever lore behind it, it'll likely maintain a massive Strength value, as well as up front crit'.<br />

<br />
Val'anyr is right before Cataclysm? Wha? You do know that Ulduar is the 2nd of four raids released in Wrath, and the 3rd tier of the expansion is freshly released, and the 4th is still in developement. Cataclysm is also still in developement, and we'll still have a few months before we see Icecrown, and then we'll have a waiting period before Cataclysm. So Val'anyr is definitely not released RIGHT BEFORE EXPANSION TIME ZOMGWTFBBQ.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aabeba</div><div class="date">2009-08-28, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess most legendaries are going to melee-oriented classes because they occupy the most lorespace. I mean, take a look at all the mightiest heroes from Warcraft III: Arthas, Illidan, Grom, Thrall, Cairne, Uther - these are, in a broader sense, warriors - regardless of stringent class labels and designations, they are tireless fighters on the battlefield who do battle up-close and personal. Of course, Jaina, Kael, and Tyrande are all very important figures as well, but don't quite have the same weight. Priests, warlocks and hunters (not rangers, note the lack of a pet) are less prominent in traditional Warcraft canon, so I can see the reasoning behind Blizzard's decision. Try naming one really famous warlock (excluding eredar), true priest or hunter from past Warcraft games that can rival Thrall or Muradin in notoriety.<br />
<br />
There are other possibilities of course, among them the fact that bi-manual weapons are of use to all three of the plate classes, while bows only primarily serve hunters.<br />

There's as much reason to complain about it as there is about anything else in this game. If they didn't &quot;set out to slight the draenei&quot; (or, rather, to slight the fanbase), here's a novel idea: Reconsider doing exactly that. (And I really don't buy the &quot;it'd ruin our artistic vision&quot; excuse. Giving draenei a new class and maybe an intro quest for it wouldn't particularly affect the greater story at all.)<br />
<br />
And as for not being restricted to one race? Sure, we're not. But for some of us (hell, I'd almost say a lot of us), it defeats the purpose to have to roll something that we'll have less fun playing. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I still think they should give Draenei's a new Class. Some of the class/race additions need looked at, and the racials.Agreed on all counts. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What would they give them? The only classes left are warlocks and druids.You forgot rogue. <br />
Warlocks are out of the question since the Draenei fled from their demonic eredar cousins and a draenei druid? C'mon, a troll druid would be more believable than that.Agreed on warlock, but not druid. Trolls have their animal gods, but draenei have shown an interest in philosophies that complement their faith. They're also closely allied with both the night elves and the furbolgs of Azuremyst. <br />
<br />
<br />
He was a shaman, Gul'Dan was the warlock IIRCGul'dan was also a shaman before he was a warlock. Most, if not all, of the first orcish warlocks were.</div></div><hr />

As much as your class &quot;LOLPalli&quot; has visited the nerf clinic,you shouldnt worry what it looks like,how is the weather down there at the bottom end of the dmg meters?<br />
<br />
Incoming nerf to Protadins in 3.2.2 (lol) awwww /cry?<br />
<br />
However Holy Palli's are still beast healers,but its probably the hardest healing class to play,mainly because your a stationary healer and must think ahead before doing anything because your target could get blasted while your on the move,sad thing is there arent that many good holy pallis,and i have proof:Look at all the palli's that went ret in 3.0 for easymode facerolling,that spec gets nerfed and what happens? those same bads go prot/holy for pvp,yet another easymode for the same bads,now with the upcoming nerf to prot/holy double dipping in spellpower where will they go?<br />
Oh i know,we will see the representation of DK's and Rogue's climb even higher. true story</div></div><hr />

When you set out to play WOTLK did u honeslty expect blizzard to make the final raid legendary viable for any class but DK's and classes seaking equivalent stats??<br />
Seriously, all of you caster DPS that QQ about this weapon need to recall your memory from when you first started playing Wrath.I'm actually surprised that blizzard did'nt make the axe only DK's, guess they could only deal with 70% of the classes QQ'ing. I fear that they might actually have to deal with fury warriors as well if they make the axe unique, i will make sure to watch the forums if they do to see fury warriors get totally reamed for being totally greedy.<br />
<br />
As for the race specific mounts for the pallies, QUIT COMPLAINING, its not like you will ride around on ur charger (or w/e they plan to do for all races) all the time, after all, these days you don't have to work towards getting it. And also the Tauren or Draenei DK's didn't complained about their stupid mount, and any other race you see riding it was too lazy to get the gold to buy a cooler one.</div></div><hr />
