We made many changes yesterday. A lot of these were bug fixes, and many bug fixes will affect damage one way or the other. So just because you don't see a specific change referenced below, doesn't mean it didn't change.<br />
<br />
With that said, here are the specific changes we made in reference to my previous post:<br />
<br />
1) We buffed the base points and coefficients of many warrior dps abilities. We didn't do as much to tanking abilities.<br />
<br />
We buffed the base points and coefficients of many Ret abilities.<br />
<br />
We buffed the base points and coefficients of many Feral cat abilities.<br />
<br />
2) We lowered the base points and coefficients of many mage abilities, but lowered Fire more than the other two.<br />
<br />
3) We nerfed Shadow Word: Death, but it is possible we didn't nerf it enough. It should not be Shadow's biggest spell.<br />
<br />
4) We returned Searing Pain's damage to its 3.3.5 levels.<br />
<br />
5) We increased the benefit of resilience by 50% for players level 80 and below. The tooltips will probably not reflect this change.<br />
<br />
We don't have any other changes to announce at this time. I am reluctant to mention additional classes or specs that we are looking at currently for fear of instilling excitement or panic.</div></div><hr />

Are you referring to the QQ posts I've seen about IS spamming on AoE trash? Guess what - DPS isn't balanced around AoE or trash pulls. I can pull 10-11k on a target dummy now - pretty sure most classes are pulling that much and way more. The DPS increase is the very reason they considered nuking the ICC buff. The nerfs hotfixed here were with PvP in mind - Boomkins are NOT completely destroying everyone in PvP like Mages, Locks and Spriests were.<br />
<br />
Again - we aren't balanced at 80 noob - impossible to do when all these changes were made with 85s in mind.</div></div><hr />

No, none did 10k on test dummies before 4.0.3. Hard to say if we're actually OP without having done any proper PVE since the patch though.</div></div><hr />

That penalty is long since gone and shouldn't show it's ugly head in Cata at all. There's really nothing unique about Balance Druids anymore. There just a different kind of Mage with a couple different raid buffs and less utility.</div></div><hr />

Damage feels low to me, but I could be getting the rotation wrong with the new abilities. So far the only melee class I've seen that feels &quot;right&quot; is Unholy DK. In 25 man last night melee all felt way low compared to normal. Mages needed a nerf for sure our were WAY above normal. We did Jaraxxus 10 man for the weekly before the &quot;normal&quot; raid and our Mage hit 25K DPS with the Spell Steals. At least until he pulled aggro and died horribly :-)<br />

Who the fuck cares?<br />

Its not balanced around &quot;80&quot; which lasts really a whole 54 more days with most players having quit and waiting for cata or farming stuff for cata.<br />

So QQers like yourself should get over it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizz was told in feedback over and over and over and over again that things were not balanced at 80 WAY before release. You know what people said. To stfu about numbers, it would be fixed before it went live. Now what I would like those people to do is line up so they can admit they were wrong to the rest of us. Hell it's worth going back through previous posts just to find them. <br />
<br />
Here is a hint the same thing is happening on beta forums, and people are saying &quot;hey, it's just the beta, stfu about the numbers they will get fixed&quot;&gt; It's the same idiots who said that about 4.0.1, you think they would have learned their lesson.</div></div><hr />

out abilities does not deal more damage then any other caster. in pve, with trinket proc eclipse with 18% extra bonus of mastery and flask with some buffs, iv seen a 35k starsurge, and that is on 0resi.<br />
moonkin are &quot;fine&quot; compared to the overall overpowered damage before 85. will prolly not see any changes, but instect swarm possible</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, I think that Blizzard had everything worked out for 85 and thought the playerbase would be okay with how funky things are until Cata launch. The coefficients were probably set to be where they thought they should on the raiding scene.<br />
<br />
Of course, their main mistake in that is they misjudged their playerbase. Hell, people are probably reactivating accounts they weren't going to touch until Cata so they can cry an QQ.<br />
<br />
That said, whether or nor they thought we would deal with the discrepancies... They were far too great and needed adjustment.</div></div><hr />

Balance could do awesome DPS before the patch IF They got lucky with RNG on Eclipse. They could have an awesome night or a terrible night. Eclipse is COMPLETELY different now and no longer reliant on RNG. Eclipse procs DO NOT go away until used and energy DOES NOT decay. This is intended. All Boomkins will see a massive DPS increase because of this along with every other DPS getting a boost.<br />
<br />
As for DPS numbers - well you can't blame the Balance Druids who now have a much simpler and easier rotation. Reforging, knowing your class, latency etc etc is all playing a part in everyone's performance. Or does no one want to consider that their raids other DPS just don't know what they hell they're doing now?<br />
<br />
<br />
I LOVE how people hide behind the &quot;things are balanced for 85&quot; when it is obvious they arent. Things arent balanced at 85 on beta and Blizzard said the same thing for the changes for wrath in bc. And guess what when we did level to 80 it WASNT balanced (shocking) I have no doubt it will be the same at 85 very out of whack<br />
<br />
Balanced AROUND not @85 idiot. All the class changes were made with 85 in mind - not 80. Remember how OP DKS were at lower levels? Rets too? They leveled out at 80 - same thing will happen when we start leveling again.<br />
<br />
<br />
You have no idea how tired I am of hearing this argument. The casters are DESTROYING melee and physical in every aspect of the game right now. What caused Blizzard to overlook this during development is beyond me.<br />
<br />
But melee destroying casters with OP armor pen was OK all throughout Wrath? Destroying them on DPS and in PvP both. Level 85 is the new cap - not 80.<br />
<br />
<br />

Most moonkins can get a ton more of it because of spirit and crit on their gear and the mastery is actually good. While other classes like DPS warriors who lost their ArP to crit (and should be gemming hit from what I've read) may have a mastery that isn't so good @80.<br />
<br />
All these can be summed up in a simple phrase - changes are balanced around 85 and not 80. That doesn't mean 85 is 100% balanced - only that the changes weren't done for level 80s who are still running ICC with a 30% buff.<br />

You should read more too - I'm a tank you idiot and I've been a Druid for 5 years.<br />
<br />
But #1 Don't exaggerate numbers to call for a nerf.<br />
<br />
#2 You died to a Druid who used three abilities on you. Did you not fear him? Stun him? CC him in some way? Nuke him back or do something else to keep yourself alive while he was ramping up his damage?<br />
<br />
#3 All DoTs can crit now - use yours.<br />
<br />
#4 L2play.<br />
<br />
#5 Starfall was already nerfed into the ground - try CCing the Druid next time.<br />
<br />
#6 Unbalanced PvP is exactly what they expected. Hence why the stated they were prepared to place a dmg nerf on all BGs and Arena and hence why they buffed resil.<br />
<br />
<br />

A DPS increase of that range sounds about right. Combine the buffs every class got with the new talent trees, spells, co-efficients and all the changes with Eclipse no longer being RNG and you get a pretty big boost.<br />
<br />
Moonfire while moving an other class abilities they added are to keep DPS on those classes up when they have to move. It might feel &quot;op&quot; now but it's not @85 on Beta - fun to do yes but not OP and not a proper way to do DPS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you read earlier blue posts you would know that a lot of the hot fixes were out and out bug fixes. How some dps high and low was not being reported correctly and how certain talents were not active in the talent tree. Example some of the Ret Pally talents in the tree just weren't on and it was confirmed by GM's and Blues as a bug. Same goes for some of Mages DPS, a lot of their numbers weren't real so they had to be fixed.<br />
<br />

Are you forgetting that things are NOT balanced around level 80 but instead 85? They buffed said classes because their damage compared to others was low.

<br />
Jesus pleazus stop already and use some common sense....<br />
<br />
Quit hiding behind &quot;balanced at 85&quot;.<br />
<br />
The spells dont grow in rank anymore. They grow per level. Everyone, and I do mean EVERYONE, is getting 5 levels of the same treatment. If it's broken at 80 it is most likely going to be broken at 85 since, you know, the spell grows per level...<br />
<br />
So a bunch of people went moonkin, had a good time for a year or so, then the ride came to an end. Happens to all classes eventually. Just quit pretending &quot;things are balanced around 85&quot;. It's a nice quote and all but it isn't going to play out that way in reality, anymore than OP paladins at the end of BC content were balanced at 80. Remember? I thought so.</div></div><hr />

1)From BC to wotlk specially in the end hp was (and since 4.0) tripled.Damage was 7 times bigger (and more for some classes).In Cata hp will be tripled but damage is actually lower than 4.0 80 lvl characters (as almost every beta player states).<br />
2)Critical and Haste will be dramatically lowered in the lvling process (so the 40%crit chance and 30% haste for casters will be 10%crit chance and 10%haste).<br />
3)So we have our hp go up,we have the damage going lower it won't be messy.<br />
4)I am a shadow priest and atm SW:D crits for 15k which is 50% of the hp of the most players I faced (maybe 40% or so).When I hit 85 I will SW:D for 20k crit (IF I crit with such a low crit chance) something that will be 25%-30% of the hp of most players.(notice: 25-30% of hp in a single ability is too much but after the nerfs I see it being somewhere between 10-20% of hp)</div></div><hr />

All the changes listed there are well deserved. this coming form a fire mage who hates seeing his beloved pvp spec being taken over by retards spamming nothing but scorch and blowing everybody up:)<br />

i don't care how much damage balance druids are doing they don't need a nerf. I don't care if they're always above everyone else at the moment. You guys need to learn to play because balance druids are all better players than everyone else, all of them!</div></div><hr />

Quit hiding behind &quot;balanced at 85&quot;.<br />
<br />
The spells dont grow in rank anymore. They grow per level. Everyone, and I do mean EVERYONE, is getting 5 levels of the same treatment. If it's broken at 80 it is most likely going to be broken at 85 since, you know, the spell grows per level...<br />
<br />
So a bunch of people went moonkin, had a good time for a year or so, then the ride came to an end. Happens to all classes eventually. Just quit pretending &quot;things are balanced around 85&quot;. It's a nice quote and all but it isn't going to play out that way in reality, anymore than OP paladins at the end of BC content were balanced at 80. Remember? I thought so.<br />
<br />
You're wasting your time. Many people here are so brainwashed by Blizzard that they take everything they say to heart. &quot;Don't worry, Rets are balanced at 80&quot; - LMAO. That was a good one. It took many patches to bring them down. Blizzard is only fooling their brainwashed fans at this point anymore, but I guess that's all they need to do to keep the hive happy. Throw out some stupid statement that doesn't make sense because it never worked that way before, and all is good, suckers.<br />
<br />
Druids are some of the biggest complainers ever. Listen, no other class is the best of their 3 roles their trees allow. You guys shouldn't be the best Tank, Caster DPS, Melee DPS, and Healer, at the same time period. You guys are just so lucky that you're Blizzard's pet-fav class. 10k Starfall ticks in PVP, well, you should've stopped fighting everything else fighting you and target the druid obviously, go out of your way and look for them, l2play and junk. LOL.</div></div><hr />

Hunters were just fine before the patch, take away volley, sure, Hunter one of top dps on singletarget, yes sure<br />
<br />
the ones saying now that Hunters are just fine are those that did lousy dps to start with.<br />
<br />
i have been playing the Hunter since day 3 of vanilla and no i stand here with a well equipped Hunter that does crappy dps compared to most of our raid.<br />
<br />
yes yes go on &quot;L2P, i killed Rag when most of the anti-qqers played with their barbydolls*<br />
<br />
Give me mana back, NOW.<br />
<br />
<br />
its even worse for us who loved the mechanics of MM and survival hunters. We were already the least represented class in teams above 2k in 2s and 3s. its all gone now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as mages, wtf? They're gonna nerf fire but promote it through every other visual representation of a mage in the game... now we're going to be running around in T11 which is like on fire &quot;Hello, I'm a fire mage, look at my gear, it's on fire&quot;, and we're going to be Arcane?...<br />
<br />
Fine with me I guess. People who think arcane is anything like it used to be need to check their thinking caps. Way different play style and very good numbers considering. Even missing a glyph, Arc is hard to use mana on... IF YOU KNOW WHAT THE F YOU'RE DOING AND SET UP YOUR TOON RIGHT!!!<br />

still pretty pissed off overall, I would have been perfectly fine waiting until next month for this patch...</div></div><hr />

Just did VoA25 with all buffs possible. Food/Flasked also etc etc.<br />

8,149 dps on Koralon was my best. Admittedly, that landed me 4th spot. (Previous record is close to 13k Pre 4.0.1)<br />

Stop saying that, the stuff wasn't tuned for 85. Feral, arms/fury warriors and ret paladins are still (no change on beta) terrible dps at 85 compared to the other classes.<br />
<br />
<br />
heh, unfortunately for mages, if they lowered the fire more than rest of trees, mages are gonna be gone from raids, arcane and frost werent doing enough dmg to begin with, let alone after getting nerfed.<br />
<br />
Yeah, precisely. 100k + arcane blasts = not enough. Considering how short fights are, they basically carried the raid.<br />

<br />

It's a nice quote and all but it isn't going to play out that way in reality, anymore than OP paladins at the end of BC content were balanced at 80. Remember? I thought so.<br />
<br />
A+ to the person who doesn't understand what scaling does. There are no spell ranks anymore - correct. But BECAUSE spells automatically go up as you level - you don't have to train every time to go from rank 4 to 5 - it's a change to put an end to the &quot;ooh I leveled, now I get rank 6 hunters mark&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes - things ARE being tuned and balanced for level 85 - deny it more if you want but it only shows your ignorance in how the game works. Why won't a spell at 80 be as OP at 85? Scaling. Coefficients and how much that spell actually gains per &quot;rank&quot;. Yes ranks exist still you just don't train them - you gain them automatically as stated before. Scaling also occurs with gear. Warriors are a prime example of this. In crappy gear they do very poor DPS but I'm good gear they do amazing OP DPS. DPS warrior scaling has been a nightmare for Blizzard for years. Back in BC most guilds used a Druid starting out in Kara because they were better tanks in less gear than Warriors. Once the prots got gear the Druids weren't the main tanks anymore.<br />
<br />
I don't know why I'm even bothering as I'm sure you don't have the basic intelligence to understand the concept of scaling but there's always hope. Again - the same way some classes are super OP at certain levels is the same thing that's happening now. When LK launched Ret pallies were super OP, they nerfed them and then they sucked @80 because they overdid it and it effected their scaling. It's easier for Blizzard to do talent, spell, coefficient etc etc balancing for max level than it is to make sure everyone is equal at 80 when EVERYTHING they've done with this patch is for level 85. Level 80 is irrelevant now - all that matters is 85 and Balance Druids are in NO WAY OP at 85.<br />
<br />
Moonkin DPS has been subpar until now - dunno what you're talking about this &quot;good year&quot; BS.<br />
<br />
<br />
Stop saying that, the stuff wasn't tuned for 85. Feral, arms/fury warriors and ret paladins are still (no change on beta) terrible dps at 85 compared to the other classes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Some classes are low but the talents and how everything works is balanced for 85 - hence why they said &quot;were prepared to put a damage nerf on BGs and Arena weeks ago - they knew this would happen. They are NOT going to nerf every class that beats you in PvP only to have to buff them @85.<br />
<br />
I got one just the opposite for ya - Balance Druids are doing good right now @80 but suck at 85. Where's your logic now?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fire isn't sub-par, and haven't been so for a while. It's still one of the most fun specs to play and does great aoe-dmg. The single target dps is prob. more in line with others classes/specs now. <br />
<br />

<br />
But #1 Don't exaggerate numbers to call for a nerf.<br />
<br />
#2 You died to a Druid who used three abilities on you. Did you not fear him? Stun him? CC him in some way? Nuke him back or do something else to keep yourself alive while he was ramping up his damage?<br />
<br />
#3 All DoTs can crit now - use yours.<br />
<br />
#4 L2play.<br />
<br />
#5 Starfall was already nerfed into the ground - try CCing the Druid next time.<br />
<br />
#6 Unbalanced PvP is exactly what they expected. Hence why the stated they were prepared to place a dmg nerf on all BGs and Arena and hence why they buffed resil.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A DPS increase of that range sounds about right. Combine the buffs every class got with the new talent trees, spells, co-efficients and all the changes with Eclipse no longer being RNG and you get a pretty big boost.<br />
<br />
Moonfire while moving an other class abilities they added are to keep DPS on those classes up when they have to move. It might feel &quot;op&quot; now but it's not @85 on Beta - fun to do yes but not OP and not a proper way to do DPS.<br />
<br />
Why did you call me a idiot? How old are you? 10? Stop trying to act cool behind the computer, you dare not call me idiot IRL.. grow up!<br />
<br />
1: Okey im taking 30000 damage every 3 seconds, sounds right now does it?<br />
<br />
2: Fear has a 2 sec Cast Time and he can get immun to it. He burst me down 70% of my life, i death coil him and dies under rake criting for insane amount. <br />
Did you mean moonkin? Oh root+starfall+solar beam and im soloed. Balance?<br />
<br />
3: Im demonology, and my dots cant kill a target so fast unlike shadow priests.<br />
<br />
4: I can already play my class. I just cant play them properly against some classes that are way to OP atm. I faceroll ret paladins/elemental shamans for example. Balance the damage and ill beat your moonkin with ease.<br />
<br />
5: Fear has a 2 sec cast time, very low range and read post again you blind fool: root+solar flare!<br />
<br />
6: Yes i understand that but you said that moonkins are OK atm. Fail.<br />
<br />
7: I dont care, they are ruining the gameplay for example on WSG. Nerf them and buff them again when Cataclysm hits.<br />
<br />
<br />
Okey so your a tank and a druid and defending your moonkin spec. No, your moonkin, and having fun one shoting everything and trying to tell everyone to l2p?<br />

Its not balanced around &quot;80&quot; which lasts really a whole 54 more days with most players having quit and waiting for cata or farming stuff for cata.<br />

I'm 30 thanks for asking. Give me your address and I'll come over and call you an idiot half an inch from your face. You're an idiot because you assume I FLOTM re-rolled or play MS Balance. Which are you upset about - Feral or Moonkin cuz you're QQing about both. Feral JUST got a hotfix to buff them and have been a hard counter to Mages and Locks to a lesser extent all through Wrath. As for Moonkin - ever hear of a trinket? Get out of roots and walk out of Solar Beam or send your Felguard in to beat the snot out of him.<br />
<br />
But why am I going into this with someone who obviously thinks the game is balanced around 1v1.<br />
<br />
For the record - I'm a tank and off spec Balance and I WILL advocate for my class as a whole. You're only complaint is PvP well again - (blue in the face here) &quot;Were prepared to put a damage nerf in BGs and Arena&quot; so deal with it. If you got one shot by a Moonkin then get better gear.<br />
<br />
Oh I see - nvm - you want a time machine back to when all PvP locks were SL/SL facerolling everything. I understand now - you're just butthurt.<br />

They will either buff resil again or put the damage nerf in PvP out. When they nerf for 80 they end up having to buff @85. I'd rather them not break a half dozen classes for end game just because level 80 with 85 talents, glyphs, skills etc are causing some people to QQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okey i dont wana fight anymore, seriously, its not that mature.<br />
<br />
Okey you misunderstanded me, im saying that i want to play bgs properly, and this moonkin comes one shoting me, how the hell am i supposed to carry flag anyway? Im paying for this game to fully work and now theres a small crack on it.<br />
<br />
Im not thinking that this game is balanced 1v1, but some classes hits for like 10000 damage over 3 seconds, which is OK atm, and some specs hits for 5 times more damage, and this need to be tuned down. <br />
<br />
In a avarage BG a moonkin does 5 x killing blows and 20 x more damage than any other class, if you havent noticed. <br />
<br />
My FEL GUARD gets ONE SHOTED by starfall you know. Axe toss? Just trinket out of it and laugh at me while i get soloed by starfall.<br />
<br />
Get better gear? Hmm you mean 30 more resi? Sure that will help!<br />
<br />
Missunderstanding once again. I said i wanted to put you moonkins back to TBC state so i can solo you with 1 spell ( hand of gul'dan ). You are so strong now its insane and you claim that your skilled, you actually are NOT!<br />
<br />
And yes i played SL SL warlock back in BC, and yes i knew my spec was extremely OP but no other specs were viable in pvp. I even created several posts in the forums saying that SL SL warlock need a nerf and suggestion to buff other specs but Blizzard didnt care.<br />
<br />
The forum fight is over. Go find someone else to fight with. Or at least grow up.</div></div><hr />

Quoted for truth. If you're 30 and you're fighting over these little technical things calling people idiots all the time on the forums while it's a discussion about spellranks and such, you seriously need to grow up.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, what a whining on this forum of people that apparently can't get these conspiracy theories &quot;OMG BLIZZ HATES MY CLASS!!!@?!&quot; out of their heads, having this crack in their brain that prevents them from believing Blizzard is doing this for balance instead of pestering particular classes.<br />
<br />
At last: Again another bunch of wannabe tough guys here saying all their friends do 10k dps+ on the target dummy easily and that the rest is noob when they can't hit 10k. You and your friends are so cool now. Fortunately this is just a forum and many people won't believe you till they've seen it.<br />
<br />
I thought the mmo champion forum community was a bit more mature than the EU forum community, but apparently 80% is the same as there. That sucks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean, if you were not able to get an ICC raid spot because your low dps as fury warrior you had some serious L2P problems that are not going to be solved with buffs. If you are complaining because of a Mage nerf, well that's just how things are... you can ask for advice to vanilla locks, see what they thing about nerfing a class.<br />
<br />
bottom line, if you know your class you normally dont give a damn about nerfs buffs unless you are a top 1% arena player or a Paragon member, which Im afraid 90% of the people posting here arent (me included)</div></div><hr />

Agreed.<br />
<br />
Also ive got to say, ive been in about 6 BGs since 4.0.1 and a boomkin has been top of the KB and Dmg done everytime.<br />
Its not a matter of blowing a trinket and countering his moves because he can kill u in about 2secs of dot casting.</div></div><hr />

No rogues were/are/will ever do 10k solo to a test dummy. Hyperbole much? I've got pretty much all 277 gear, and don't even see &gt;8.5k. Prior to this patch, it was only 5-7k to a dummy.

<br />
1) You take away a system which has defined a class for 5 years in next swing moves, its not the skills which tell you 'HEY' I am playing warrior ! it's the rotations and then feel of it. So what do you have now ? a no rotation click what's on proc, OW that's what dps palas do right ? These changes i guess have been done by the same person who brought pala dps to the raid, and you can TELL ! They going to take away DOTS from locks soon and ruin a class like they have warrior ?<br />
<br />
2) Do blizzard have a test realm ? I am sure they do ! So if that's the case why have these changes come mega miss balanced ? Don't people talk or give feed back on the test realms ? was these changes ever made on the realms for people to say HEY that's crap DONT do it ? If you have a test realm and still have this sort of cock-up why even have it ? Blizzard should just shut the realm down because it clearly doesn't work ! Then again if they respond like they do to ticket posts, I cant blame people for not bothering. (3 days is a long take to get a answer)<br />
<br />
3) I don't know who makes decisions within blizzard about release dates etc, but wouldn't it of made sense to OPEN up the 1-60 leveling area NOW so people could see the new areas and level a new character in time for cata release ? Wouldn't that of made sense ? Do blizzard think people are going to start a new character on cata release ? hmmmmm NOOOOOOOO 99.99999999999% of people are going to level 80 to 85 and want to see the instances. Again i hope someone from blizzard reads this post and thinks hey that's not a bad idea business wise and sense wise.<br />
<br />

<br />
8,149 dps on Koralon was my best. Admittedly, that landed me 4th spot. (Previous record is close to 13k Pre 4.0.1)<br />
<br />
Funny there was a Ret paladin pulling a solid 10k effortlessly. :/<br />
<br />
And how again do you know it was effortlessly, and not just him being way better then you:P?<br />

so now fire mage pvp is gonna be even less fun than yesterday? u over nerfed us as usual, im tired of this game...<br />
<br />
i just had to post because of this.<br />
people like you are the ones who &quot;try&quot; to ruin this game by whining when something isn't piss easy and faceroll anymore. If the spec is Op as hell: yay good job blizzzz, I'm having fun now. Then it gets some , small well deserved, dmg nerfes: OMG blizz good job on ruining the spec. Now it will be unplayable through all of cata.<br />
<br />
Listen. the class isn't either &quot;super viable&quot;, or &quot;worst shit spec ever&quot;.<br />
<br />
First: No they did not overnerf fire. The dmg nerf was well deseved seeing as I didn't lose a single duel before the nerf, and that was without having really adjusted to the new playstyle. That's called faceroll extreme.<br />
Secondly: Do you even play the game? I don't see how you can say a spec that is currently only inferior to frost, arcane, balance druids, elemental shamans and Sub rogues in terms of dmg , is overnerfed. It's easy to tell that you're probably horrible at pvp, and all you care about is globaling people down. You don't WANT to become better.<br />
<br />
All they changed was some of the dmg output. I still easily kill people. After the nerf I've lost maybe....2 duels out of 30-40 or something,and those were against garrote glyphed sub rogues and Shadowpriests, (a Sp I beat 5 game in a row after).<br />
<br />
I beat arcane mages, shadowpriests, frost mages, rogues, all hunters and, heck, every single spec out there. Not directly because it's OP, since many of those duels end with me at 10-20% hp left, but because I've been pvp fire through 90% of wrath. Fire WAS terrible in terms of mana, horrible survivability against dots, but had a huge fun factor.<br />
Now the spec is actually more then viable, but still has those elements of &quot;non facerollness&quot; about it. Still the dmg is high even after tha patch. I'm not trying to show off my awesome skills here, but if you think fire is terrible now....well then you probably were one of those who said seaosn 5 dk's were fine, and that early survival hunters and holy/rets didn't deserve any nerfs.<br />
<br />
Go to sleep you jackass and never post stupid shit like that again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okey i dont wana fight anymore, seriously, its not that mature.<br />
<br />
Okey you misunderstanded me, im saying that i want to play bgs properly, and this moonkin comes one shoting me, how the hell am i supposed to carry flag anyway? Im paying for this game to fully work and now theres a small crack on it.<br />
<br />
Im not thinking that this game is balanced 1v1, but some classes hits for like 10000 damage over 3 seconds, which is OK atm, and some specs hits for 5 times more damage, and this need to be tuned down. <br />
<br />
In a avarage BG a moonkin does 5 x killing blows and 20 x more damage than any other class, if you havent noticed. <br />
<br />
My FEL GUARD gets ONE SHOTED by starfall you know. Axe toss? Just trinket out of it and laugh at me while i get soloed by starfall.<br />
<br />
Get better gear? Hmm you mean 30 more resi? Sure that will help!<br />
<br />
Missunderstanding once again. I said i wanted to put you moonkins back to TBC state so i can solo you with 1 spell ( hand of gul'dan ). You are so strong now its insane and you claim that your skilled, you actually are NOT!<br />
<br />
And yes i played SL SL warlock back in BC, and yes i knew my spec was extremely OP but no other specs were viable in pvp. I even created several posts in the forums saying that SL SL warlock need a nerf and suggestion to buff other specs but Blizzard didnt care.<br />
<br />
The forum fight is over. Go find someone else to fight with. Or at least grow up.<br />
<br />
You will be happy to know moonkins got a nerf.<br />
You are an idiot if you think moonkins can burst out 50 k damage instantly.<br />
You say starfall &quot;one shots&quot; you, but starfall ticks crit for 5 k on things that have no resil assuming you don't LOS range stun or fear us, if your pet has 5 k life then your bad.<br />
You say fear has a 2 second cast well roots has a cast as well, what about death-coil then fear? or lock portaling away, every class has different skills to do different things, I'm not a big pvper, but you seem to think you should just be able to casualty stroll down the middle of WSG doting people up being untouchable?<br />
<br />
No moonkin does 10 k dmg from dots in 3 seconds, even on 0 resil we would do about 5-6 tops assuming the moonkin is in full pve gear<br />
as far as how big of a nerf you ask, they halved insect swarm, and I believe they nerfed starsurge and starfire<br />
<br />
I went from 8.5 k dps pre patch to 12.4 k post patch, to 10.8 k post nerf on a target dummy with MOTW<br />
don't bitch about moonkins any more until they nerf half the other specs ingame, KTHXBAI!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MeurigVII</div><div class="date">2010-10-15, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From what I could tell the ret pally dps has gone up a <br />
considerable amount. I'm sitting in 4/5 T10 with a 251<br />
Helm, 251 2h and boots, 275 and 245 ring, 227? Neck, <br />
And a 264 cloak. On the last boss of the old kingdom I<br />
pulled 11.5K dps. The overall output for ret pallies have<br />
Been fixed. For those retadins not pulling the numbers you did before or more... Learn how to play your spec. I love what they did to pallies (new mechanic, Single-Target beasts). Thank you blizzard!<br />
<br />
What people have to remember is cata is not built on AoE pulls anymore. It's very CC based. With that in mind all our toons are now a &quot;mostly single-target&quot; style of play vs. AoE. <br />
<br />
Paladin tanks are not very good AoE tanks anymore because of those reasons (cata being CC heavy). Consecration is on a 30sec cooldown and holy wrath is divided evenly among all targets in range (which could yield very little damage if there's too much in the area). I'm not saying tankadins can't aoe tNk anymore, they're just not as efficient as they were prior to the patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and yes, i did 12k on saurfang, and on other bosses barely over 10k, combat rogues used to scale good with buffs, now take away ArP; and if that loss isn't enough; buffs are downscaled as well, every combat rogue i know has specced assassination to remain viable for raids, i refuse to believe we're 'just fine'.</div></div><hr />

I have a 6356 gs kitty, who was previouly before the hot fix losing 4600 dps on a target dummy REGEMMED. what people are forgetting saying melle got over buffed is that melee aoe got a 75percent loss in dps ( FERAL at Least) like that matters its trash, but after the patch i posted 18400 on saurfang heroic in 10 man , before with all the buffs in 25 heroic with kings, MOTW stacking etc i barely pulled 16500 and this was also due to the fact that the treat tables are not balanced i see bosses running all over the place now because tanks have some new shit to learn esp warriors. I did pull off the bear tank with 90K health within 10 secs so threat isnt fixed and they are planning on it we were not overbuffed , we were given a task to learn mastery in reforging resultts in me have 50 PERCET more bleed damage on rips and rakes. equalling half my dps on a long fight. we no longer get savage roar buff on our yellow attacks so there was a major nerf there . I have a feeling were given this task because blizzard wants threat watched closely which is a mechanic alot ignore and just sit there and hit with a good ass tank , that isnt happening anymore with us kittys dont know a bout the warrior dps buff though. time to go back to the old days and pay attention i guess. this isnt a child tank and spank game , mangle did get a good buff cause where not always behind to shred and were losing alot of dps that way. no other melee class had to worry about that so some fights cats totoaly suckd ,<br />
