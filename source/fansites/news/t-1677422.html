<br />
Patch 6.1 - Twitter Integration<br />
The implementation is really slick and out of the way. If you're using Twitter it helps you share things with an in-game UI you can choose to bring up. If you don't use Twitter just don't attach a Twitter account and I don't think you'll see anything related to it. The goal isn't to start socializing everything, it's really just to make it more convenient for people that already are sharing their gameplay. If you know anything about our UI and philosophy on simplicity I think you'll have a good idea of how subdued the implementation is, but it could get fun as Addons hook in and interact with it.<br />
<br />
Can you supply a screenshot of the feature (in what I assume is a pop-up window) and a screenshot of the UI WITHOUT the pop-up. Like, at a time where it won't be triggered.<br />
I cannot as I am at home and don't have access to an internal test client. To answer what I think is your question though, the ways you bring up the UI are by typing /twitter (I believe that's correct) or by clicking a small &quot;w)))&quot; icon that's next to existing UI elements. There's no minimap button or popup telling you to Tweet about things.<br />
<br />
And that is why I won't be using this feature at all. Having Addons 'hook in' on a feature that is tied to my twitter account is not one I would trust. Too much chance of Addons starting to spam up my twitter feed with their own 'subtle' or not so subtle advertising.<br />
An addon cannot tweet something for you; you have to hit the button.<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 6.1 - Archaeology Progress Restoration<br />
The development team members working on this issue believe they have now found a solution and are hoping to implement this in patch 6.1. If everything goes according to plan, the fix should merge your wiped data/artifacts etc. with your current information. If your skill level was higher before the incident, you will be boosted back up to your previous level. We will be monitoring the situation closely once patch 6.1 launches and will continue to use this thread to provide updates.<br />

World of Warcraft 10th Anniversary Ending<br />
The 10th anniversary celebration (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/355646-anniversary-event-extension/) is coming to an end soon. You have until Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 10 a.m. PST / Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 10:00 a.m. CET to get anything you may have missed.<br />
<br />
If you logged in at all during the event, the Molten Corgi (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/84915-molten-corgi) would have arrived in your mail. A successful run of the 40 player Raid Finder version of Molten Core rewarded a nice Core Hound (http://www.wowdb.com/items/115484-core-hound-chain) mount. The Hatespark the Tiny (http://www.wowdb.com/items/118574-hatespark-the-tiny) pet had a 10% drop rate and the Flames of Ragnaros (http://www.wowdb.com/items/118572-flames-of-ragnaros) weapon enchant transmog had a 2% drop rate (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/11502-ragnaros?drops-item-page=2&amp;drops-item-subtab=18#related:drops-item). Anyone that killed Ragnaros also got a spec appropriate item level 640 helm (http://www.wowdb.com/items/armor?filter-icon=inv_crown_02&amp;filter-ilvl-min=640&amp;filter-ilvl-max=640&amp;filter-source=8&amp;filter-slot=2).<br />

Character / Items<br />
so do I, i also don't mind random stats in wow on loot that isn't from raids<br />
WoW doesn't really have &quot;grey&quot; items as &quot;rewards&quot; anymore, though. More incidental gold acquisition. Not in chests. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/551280547947765761))<br />
Oh man, tell that to my salvage yard. <br />
Haha, touché, you opted in to that one though (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/551281086722867200))<br />
I did, it's free money, as I said I don't mind greys or whites.<br />
They're great in some, but I don't think they're the right fit for every game. Specific items tell a better story. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/551282079179096065))<br />

PvP<br />
Possible to make Ashran Que make louder sound upon popping? Tab out for 30 seconds and miss que after 1+ hours in ;_;<br />
We'll take a look (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/551132992458854400))<br />
<br />
I am also trying to be nice. If you have time, please look into fixing Ashran queues and imbalance,4 hr ques <br />
Ashran queues are still high priority for us. Still exploring ways to improve them. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/551133477207154689))<br />
not just queues. There is zero faction balance.<br />
faction balance is actually forced. You can only join if there is someone on the opposite side to join at same time. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/551386695472775168))<br />
<br />
Why do some classes get additional CC via glyphs? I think that's a bad idea, e.g Glyph of Garrote/Explosive Trap.<br />
Many of the glyphs appeared before our CC problem was so obvious. We nerfed them last expac. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/551387074252005376))<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
With the inn requiring the last boss killed why not have the quest item drop off the boss as well?<br />
most of the quest items have on-use effects to make your dungeon run feel a bit different (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/550890617937485824))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
Mentioned it several times that I no longer share plans about the game on Twitter. Hit up for any announcements. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/550778908573200384))<br />
Weird statement from a pvp developer. Did you take on more than you can handle?<br />
Nope, we just want to consolidate where information is coming from. Hard to follow 20 different devs. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/550840137245294593))<br />

Master Plan Addon Updated<br />
The incredibly useful Master Plan addon (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/master-plan) has been significantly updated since the last time we looked at it (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4533-Master-Plan-and-Garrison-Mission-Manager-Addons-Blue-Tweets-DLC-466). Some of the new features include:<br />
<br />
<br />
More compact layout<br />
Auto suggesting groups to maximize experience, garrison resources, and chance for success<br />
A list of the missions everyone is interested in, such as Highmaul missions, high garrison resource missions, legendary quest item missions, and more. The Blackrock Foundry missions are coming soon (http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/master-plan/tickets/229-add-blackrock-foundry-missions-to-moi-tab/). <br />
Auto completion of missions with a nice summary screen<br />
Easier upgrading of followers with an upgrade button on each follower's page<br />

Well the entire tab reset itself. You kept your level but lost all credit for the solves. I dumped a bunch of boxed artifacts into dwarf fragments and ended up making 2 rare projects that I had already made years ago in cata. I made the innkeeper's daughter and the clockwork gnome twice on the same character. That's not how archaeology was suppose to work.</div></div><hr />

I think you misunderstood that. They'll take a look into making the sound it makes louder. Like when you are using the dungeon browser I can clearly hear that it's ready when I'm tabbed out, but not for Ashran.</div></div><hr />

Master Plan is so ridiculous. I downloaded it the first time it was featured on here and every time I go check on it (which is like every week - every 2 weeks) they've made some update that makes it change wildly but for the better. Don't think I've seen any addon evolve quite like it has.</div></div><hr />

You should really read his explanation and try to think before you make posts. He is exactly right, especially for class issues, you have 20+ devs all giving little pieces of information here and there on twitter. It is smarter for an ORGANIZATION to share their information through one account.<br />

<br />
There has been a hotfix a while back that results in your followers always gaining at least some experience. Red = 10%, Orange = 50%, Green = 100%.<br />
<br />
Thus, Master Plan will for example put a lvl 90 follower into a lvl 100 mission with the logic that 10% of a 2000XP-mission with 10.000XP-Bonus (1200XP) is still way higher than 100% of a lvl 90 mission that awards 200something XP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
besides the discussion on top - does anybody know what font is used in these screenshots? I like it very much and would appreciate a response.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance,<br />

Verdana and Calibri are close, but not quite identical. I would love to know the answer to this as well.</div></div><hr />

What's worse is when somehow everyone gets raid assist and marks themselves a tank and causes the whole raid UI to fill up your screen to where no one can utilize it beneficially.</div></div><hr />

People advertise for them for free on Twitter and pretty much every other social media platform already. I think you can understand why some 'I just got XYZ achievement in WoW check me out!' template spam might not be the most effective advertisement so let's not go out of our way to expose this as some sort of conspiracy just yet.</div></div><hr />

When I saw how few people had done both the Horde and Alliance TMvSS achievements I decided to finally level my Horde main and get it on her, too, and I'm curious if there were enough others who did that to make a noticeable increase in that percentage as compared to the numbers who got the other achievements in the last week of the event.</div></div><hr />

We'll take a look (holinka)<br />

Alright, these people are unbelievable. Queue popup duration is something that should have been addressed early on. Now they say they will take a look?<br />
<br />
Added recently sound notify for that in my addon:<br />
