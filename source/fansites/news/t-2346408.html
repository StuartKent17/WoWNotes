It would make sense to have them come out during Legion since they are a big part of the Legion story line. Also they said rep with their factions would likely be a part of the unlocking process and it would suck if you had to go back during BfA and do rep grinds just for the allied races.</div></div><hr />

It also gives more incentive to level in 7.3.5s new level scaling in 7.3.5 rather than in 8.0.</div></div><hr />

It's probably Nightborne related. Void Elves are probably going to have stuff on Argus or some Void-themed added zone or something. Their entire purpose is wrapped up in that stuff.</div></div><hr />

I imagine because the backpack is hardcoded they couldn't have risked any more without breaking it.<br />

4 isn't a huge deal I admit but it's not something that is the end of the world.<br />

Other bags will just keep getting bigger in return. I have a shit ton of free bagspace.<br />

Yep, it makes even more sense to let us have (some of) the allied races earlier than 8.0 because it gives us something todo for a bit and lets people who want to play BfA as them level them up to 110 and not have to rush/use a boost and miss out on the armour set.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Welcome to the Patch 7.3.5 Public Test Realm! This patch includes several new updates and content, and also lays some of the groundwork for the upcoming Battle for Azeroth expansion.<br />
<br />
Our biggest focus for testing during this PTR period will be on the new level 1-100 zone and dungeon scaling we’re introducing with 7.3.5. This is an extensive change to how loot, quests, and creatures work in the open world, so we’re going to need as much feedback as we can get about how things are working out. We’ll have some more details in the coming days about how you can best help us make sure this new feature rolls out as smoothly as possible.<br />
<br />
Other features you’ll see on the PTR over the next few weeks include Ulduar Timewalking, a preview of the new Silithus Battleground, and a few other bits of content that get into the aftermath of the events in Antorus and set the stage for the upcoming conflict in Battle for Azeroth. Note that since development of the new expansion is now in full swing, datamining sites are likely to see some bits and pieces of features that are part of Battle for Azeroth (such as Allied Races).<br />
<br />
As we’ve done for similar patches in Legion, we’ll be providing updates throughout the PTR process that give insight into what’s being made available for testing and what sort of feedback would be most helpful. Thanks for checking it out, and happy testing!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, I think it could be time for a complete overhaul of storage. At least personal banks should be treated the way guild banks are, but that's derailing and another thread for another time.</div></div><hr />

How about 20 additional for everyone and 34 total for peeps with security key!</div></div><hr />

Other bags will just keep getting bigger in return. I have a shit ton of free bagspace.<br />

I imagine with the hardcoding this was all they could do.<br />

The point of this is to encourage account security over anything else.<br />

They add a couple slots, nothing to write home about but still 4 additional slots that people without authenticators won't have. It can probably be expanded upon. And now they're obviously in the wrong for not incentivizing added security harder... :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
The thing is with hardcoding you can only change so much before a major issue can occur. All I can say is adding more probably would have created more issues than could be solved. Key word is probably in all this of course.<br />
<br />
Sometimes with hardcoding it's nigh impossible.<br />

I'm not saying it's a full on 100% reason.<br />
<br />
But hardcoding is really a pain in the backside to work around. You can either do so much or nothing at all.<br />

That's why we got bigger bags over the years. And improved storage methods.<br />

Well the Suramar one has to be for the Allied Race stuff.<br />

I'm assuming the Stratholme one is for when we get EK back as Alliance.<br />

Meh not really keen on Hawkstriders.<br />

I second that, but the Void variety appeals to me where the &quot;regular&quot; ones using the old, outdated textures fail. <br />
As for insect mounts I can but agree, it's a shame that they didn't add more of them, nor made a mount out of the black Draenor Reaver. There was also hope that the &quot;Nightmare Wasp&quot; in Legion would be a mount, but no Sir... &lt;.&lt;</div></div><hr />

Likely a placeholder, since it's not even stuck into silithus in that pic. When you think about it though, that's probably how big the sword should be.<br />

To be honest I haven't had any bagspace issues yet. Ironically Transmog and Void Storage were a godsend. Hell the wardrobe was a godsend to my Void storage. :)<br />

Those of us that started much later in the expansion can still do it. 75 Rep per WQ seems kind of daunting but I mean you figure 75 rep x(however many WQs you do until exalted) and you'll be exalted. Lots of people never look at the &quot;big picture&quot; unfortunately :c</div></div><hr />

Although perhaps Zandalari and Dark Iron will be unlocked through questing and story rather than reputation? Void Elves is an even bigger question mark...</div></div><hr />

Although perhaps Zandalari and Dark Iron will be unlocked through questing and story rather than reputation? Void Elves is an even bigger question mark...<br />
<br />
Really feel like Zandalari will have some sort of rep item hand in, much like the trolls had for the original Zul'Gurub. Same could be said for the Dark Iron too, it makes sense, but I could see it unlock however fast a player wants it to.</div></div><hr />

This is not the expansion, this is another patch for Legion. We're getting this + probably more patches before BfA's pre-patch content, it seems according to people having been at and spoken to Blizzard employees, so as to tie us over.</div></div><hr />

Probably still a while away.<br />
<br />
7.3.5 is just a few 8.0 systems so they can get them implemented now so there is more work on the core of the expansion itself.</div></div><hr />

Just seems like a massive waste of dev time for 4 whopping slots if it took any more then 10 minute to fix. Should just give us a second bank tab or make void storage proper storage since for most people that just sits useless now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I doubt it, they said that Silvermoon and the Exodar were the last bastions of their respective factions, so Silvermoon is staying Horde and Exodar staying Alliance. Also nothing has changed on that map other than they have added a bit of rock around the water edge. Which... well it's blizzard... so they are lazy as all hell. Love their game but dammmmmmmmmmmmmmmn do they need to update things! Silvermoon still has Horde Embassy walking around and statues of their old Prince as well as giant fel crystals, most of which just wouldn't be there now, Silvermoon should have been rebuilt by now too BUT Blizzard are lazy, same with Exodar, should have been rebuilt and the area around made happier after they crashed.</div></div><hr />

Old world in the next patch seem to have been buffed by about 400% and has ilvl scaling.<br />
Old raids have been buffed by around 300% marrowgar in heroic had 53 million, up from 16 million on live. My damage was also about 50% lower on the boss compared to live so you will not 1 shot old bosses anymore.<br />
<br />
It's more drastic than that in cataclysm raids. In ICC where I would crit for 16 mil on live I crit for 8. In Cata I crit for 4. A decease of 75% compared to live.<br />
Old raids from purely a numbers stand point will take 2.25 times longer to complete now per boss.</div></div><hr />

But hardcoding is really a pain in the backside to work around. You can either do so much or nothing at all.<br />

They made the Core Hound pet.<br />
<br />
Personally I didn't buy it for the goodies. I like the extra security which it provides. Had it for 7 years now and works like a dream still.<br />
<br />
I use it as well, but if they really wanted to sell it to reduce their customer service costs. The easiest way to do it is to create a amazing mount that people will really want. Mounts are more popular than pets and bag space. The only other thing would be some transmog items but I think the mount would be the most popular.</div></div><hr />

Because since it now scales, the quests won't be green after a while in the zone you are questing in, you overall get more xp from the quests. Since it scales, you also don't have to travel so much, so saving time=more xp.<br />

Since it scales, you also don't have to travel so much, so saving time=more xp.<br />
<br />
As I see it at least.<br />
<br />
Agreed. It will still hurt those who level by chain-running LFG, but then, that may be the point.</div></div><hr />

It was an utter BS right now, even with green quests you were leveling so fast that even scaling wouldn't help with finishing any higher level zones. Since right now we'll be always getting the most optimal amount of XP from quests, this change is very welcome. Without increased XP required to level up the scaling would make leveling even more faster, which would be crazy stupid.</div></div><hr />

That's ridiculous. Was expecting at least 8 slots. I mean, it doesn't change anything on their end, and would make our life way better.<br />
At the beginning I was even hoping for 12 slots...</div></div><hr />

You don't need to learn whilst leveling 1 to fucking 60. 95% of your core Rotation abilities aren't even worthwhile using until you hit 90+ And yes I have leveled recently, It did go fast and that was a good thing.</div></div><hr />

Not surprising, might also be an early warning they want to try to extend things longer than need be for DAU/MAU numbers...again. <br />
<br />
Then again, I could be wrong and it won't make it live. Who knows. /shrug :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
So now them improving the experience and making it less of a faceroll = a scheme to up MAU-numbers...?<br />
<br />
It's not as though it's been given as feedback for 7+ years by now that the leveling content is a pushover, braindead experience to seasoned players or anything...<br />
<br />
Last night I undressed my male Undead warlock, with a tank pet, and I was able to run around tagging every single bear, human, mastiff and fox in the area without ever being in any danger. My pet was on defense, and it only got triggered to attack once when a fox caught up to me. <br />
<br />
That should not be possible when at the appropriate level for the zone.</div></div><hr />

I'd rather get a root canal than level in WoW from level 1 these days. It's tedious. the quests are boring. Most of the dungeons haven't been updated in years. BC and Wrath leveling is the worst though. Increasing exp will only make the process of leveling from the beginning even more painful. Before you cry &quot;hur hur casuals&quot;, they're making Classic servers for the masochists that enjoy grinding. I don't enjoy grinding. I want to experience content I just paid for a bit more quickly. Now that's gonna take longer. They better increase quest experience with this or I'm gonna be so mad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then don't wear heirlooms. How does increasing the time it takes to lvl by 40% make it less braindead. you are doing the same thing, for 40% longer. I'd say that would make me very much the non braindead side.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I lv60 I can only do the beginning zone of Outland and LK for a few level for example, I can't go to the one I want, meaning I'll always do the same first few quests on alts we already do today if it stays like that. Hope they'll change that quickly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A quest in Westfall currently rewards far less experience than a quest in Eastern Plaguelands because of the obvious level discrepancy between those two zones. For zone scaling to work, the experience rewarded by quests must also scale and change as you progress in levels.<br />
<br />
Until somebody mentions how much experience a quest rewards, I'm not going to worry about the amount of experience required to level. It may not have even changed much. Remember, these are datamined numbers that may be misinterpreted.<br />
<br />
If somebody can actually time themselves going from 1-20 on live and compare that to 1-20 on 7.3.5 using the same class and under the same circumstances, then we can have a discussion. Until that point, whining about a datamined number will do nothing for you.</div></div><hr />

Ummm, yeah - that doesn't look bad at all now does it...<br />
Because of scaling you're never see another green quest while leveling, which means the net experience gain is higher. To compensate, they're increasing the amount of experience required to level.</div></div><hr />

All you got to do is level with white vendor armor &amp; weapon if you don't want braindead easy fast leveling. As a matter of fact, making the game more challenging and slower for yourself is pretty ridiculously easy. To be honest, it doesn't sound like you want the game slower for you. Sounds like you want the game slower for everyone else who you don't speak for.</div></div><hr />
