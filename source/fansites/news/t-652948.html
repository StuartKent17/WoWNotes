We'll try to get the full notes out soon, but even then remember that this is a major &quot;new tier&quot; patch and is likely to have more iteration due to PTR feedback than the last few patches. <br />
<br />
Update - Patch 3.2 Shaman Changes<br />
<br />
We have changed Healing Way to work better with HW and we have changed Improved Water Shield to also work with CH. We also dropped the cooldown of NS to 2 min so that you can HW more often. We'll try to make a post of all of the Resto changes soon. <br />
<br />
[...] Improved Water Shield procs will not consume Water Shield charges. The tooltip says something like &quot;as if you had consumed an orb.<br />

New Shaman Totem Bar<br />
There comes a time in all shaman’s lives when they must learn to harness the power of nature and wield powerful totems. As they grow in power, so do the opportunities to use these instruments of healing, protection, and destruction. In the upcoming content patch, Call of the Crusade, the shaman will be able to quickly place totems of each element, aiding them in managing these powerful focuses of nature.<br />
<br />
We wanted to provide some insight regarding the upcoming shaman-specific interface addition, the Totem Bar. Shaman will be able to utilize this new bar to manage their fire, earth, water, and air totems in a more accessible and convenient way. This bar will appear on the left-hand side above the standard toolbar, similar to warrior stances or druid forms. The bar contains space for four totems of the player’s choice, one of each element. Clicking the respective button will drop that totem. To the right of the four totems is a button for Totemic Call, which we have renamed Call of Earth. To the left of the four totems is a new ability named Call of Fire which will drop all four totems on the bar at once. The mana cost is the same as if the shaman dropped all four of the totems one at a time. However, it takes but a single global cooldown.<br />
<br />
Questing shaman will be able to quickly move their totems of choice forward, while a shaman in an instance, Arena, or Battleground will be able to replace their totems if they have to move or if the totems are destroyed.<br />
<br />
Shamans will also be able to customize their bar to set Call of Fire to drop less than four totems if they choose. Access to this functionality is made available at the same level as Call of Earth (currently level 30.) At higher levels, Shaman will gain two additional spells, Call of Air and Call of Water. These function exactly the same as Call of Fire, essentially giving the shaman three different sets of totems that can be placed at once. New key bindings will also be made available for all of these slots.<br />
<br />
As with all new content under testing, we want to caution players that, as a new part of the interface, there may be additional changes during the period of the PTR until the release of the Call of the Crusade content patch. We look forward to constructive feedback once it is available for testing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
IMO do to the lore they did describe, this should be a high level shaman ability,<br />
<br />
or stage how many they can drop at once. <br />
<br />
IE, 2 at level 30, 3, at level 60, and all 4 at level 80.<br />
<br />
lorewise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But this means that shamans will still need to place tremor/str/stoneskin in their other button grid..<br />
since apparently you can only save 4 different totems.<br />
<br />
Its definetly a nice -- and about time -- tweak. But while theyre at it.. they should do a full management implementation instead of this semi-halfarsed addon ripoff.<br />
<br />
Unlink totems from gcd.. lookup &quot;yata&quot; addon.. implement that, ty very much.</div></div><hr />

They will never have there pet on you, just click your button whenever they take them down. It is far from perfect but 1.5 secs vs 6 secs to place totems is pwn.</div></div><hr />

They will work just like call of fire according to the post, so we can save 3 sets of 4 totems to drop in one GCD if we please. Pure awesomeness!!<br />

Well, we've been asking for them to stop macros killing our totems. Dropping new totems faster helps counter the effect yes, but it is a band-aid fix and they will probably wash their hands of the problem now rather than fixing the actual problem. This doesn't even consider the fact that most of the totems we want kept alive have cooldowns. This really only helps PvE where dropping totems was an annoyance, not PvP where dropping totems is a problem.</div></div><hr />

And they have said multiple times that they were going to help us drop totems faster and more efficiently AND try to fight totem stomping. So how about you let them release the patch and all the change before condemning them.</div></div><hr />

Question--do you intend to change the way water shield works? This will only really force us to refresh the shield even more now than we did before, forcing us to expend a valuable global cooldown even more frequently.<br />

<br />
Improved Water Shield procs will not consume Water Shield charges. The tooltip says something like &quot;as if you had consumed an orb.&quot; <br />

<br />
The only reason this is going in is due to a shift in Blizzard's UI philosophy. Until 3.0 blizzard had a policy of changing the UI as little as possible. They changed the policy during the BC life-cycle and now are willing to add things that the Addon community has been providing for years. This is why we now have raid frames, threat indicators, the guild calendar, totem timers, and the gear manager. All things that many addon users consider necessary for gameplay.<br />
<br />
Last year it was asked at blizzcon if they would consider putting a pallypower type function into the game and Blizz said &quot;probably not&quot; because it was too class specific. With this new totem bar going in, I'm wondering if they might reconsider that stance. I wouldn't be surprised to see a blessings manager in the next year or two.<br />
<br />
Now, if only they would rework that damned awful questlog.</div></div><hr />

You already have the tracking menu on the minimap. Aspect bar is a tricky one because the classbar space is already used for the petbar. There's just no really a good spot to put an aspect bar.<br />

Thankfully, that's what things like Bongos/Bartender/Macaroon are for.</div></div><hr />

i realy hope there are some PvP oriented survivability buffs, too.<br />
and even if they would not buff survivability, they should make proc im ws from lhw to 100% again, because every single healing class can outmana you, if you dont find a masochistic and good dk to play with you + a lot of water.<br />
<br />
that totem idea is nice, but when in arena are you in need of dropping 4 totems at the same time? you wont want to drop a wind totem because you need control of grounding. you will need to drop single tremor totems against priest/warlock teams extremly often. in most cases the fire totem of choice will be a dmg totem, which dont last as lon gas the others.<br />
you can def. do some nice things with reistance totems in certain situations, but i dont realy see the &quot;buff&quot; helpin in usual tremor-cleansing-grounding-searing situation :(</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">catseye543</div><div class="date">2009-06-17, 07:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately, while the change would have been nice in BC, Blizzard has missed that particular boat. While totems consuming more GCDs to put down is a factor in why people avoid playing Shaman, it's not the MAIN reason. It actually stuns me that Blizzard hasn't gotten this yet. The effort-&gt;reward of totems is out of whack, and has been ever since buff homogenization. <br />
<br />
Totems made sense pre-WotLK, in BC and vanilla. They were exceptionally powerful buffs that were balanced out by the fact that they were stationary and needed to be recast often. Many, especially Windfury, were stronger than almost every other melee buff for this reason. <br />
<br />
Fast-forward to today. Buff homogenization has made raids much easier to build, and has been good to a great many classes. However, totems were not changed. They still retain their limiting factor - static positions, short range and short durations - while providing only a slight advantage (as in the case of Enhancement SoE) or none at all (in the case of Windfury vs. Icy Talons). Shamans have to manage range, make sure they're covering their allies with their buffs, and recast often throughout the heavily movement-based fights of WotLK, all to provide the same bonus that another class can do with a 'set it and forget it' buff like Pally blessings, or a normal part of their damage rotation/resource generation like Icy Touch and Horn of Winter. If given a choice between a totem buff or a pally blessing, people will invariably choose the latter. The reasons are obvious: in WotLK boss encounters, totems are an outmoded, inefficient method of buffing.<br />
<br />
Blizzard doesn't seem to get this. They appear incapable of seeing what's right in front of them, or even worse, incapable of action because of one person's &quot;vision.&quot; Ghostcrawler's reasoning for not changing totems is, and I hope you'll forgive my paraphrasing, that 'this is the way that Shamans have always been': that it's been a feature of the class from the beginning, and they don't want to change it because of that. <br />
<br />
Saying that you are not going to change something because the old method is how it's always been done is not a valid argument. In fact, it is the avoidance of argument. It's honestly pretty bewildering to hear WoW devs talk about faithfulness to some abstract construct of class mechanics when Blizzards' ability to adapt their game to their changing world has been one of their greatest strengths.<br />
<br />
Please, if a Blizzard employee reads this who can get in touch with the designers, please pass this message along. I love my Shamans, and totems are a neat idea, but they simply don't belong now.</div></div><hr />

Im a shaman, and I feel that this will be the case as well. Then we will get the nerfbat before we can do anything about it....that or the next resto change will be &quot;your water shiled icon has been updated&quot;.<br />

Dont get me wrong Im happy for the changes, and I dont want to be op. I want to be a viable healer on par or slightly below druids/priests, but for some reason I am nervous about 3.2....</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
OP?! where?<br />
<br />
The announced changes do absolutely nothing for PVP and little for PVE...<br />
they are more quality of life changes.<br />
The only change that would increase shaman viability in raids is the chainheal one, but I doubt that +2yds jump range and 10% less healing lost per jump will make shamans OP.<br />
<br />
and like I already said, there are no changes that affect pvp at all, <br />
no one uses chain heal in pvp, watershield refreshing will still exist since shamans get actually hit in pvp.<br />
And unless they buff the hell out of shaman mana-efficiency and survivability, shamans will still suck in pvp.<br />
<br />
Im not saying shamans will or will not be OP after 3.2, but we dont know enough about the upcoming changes to speculate about shaman future.</div></div><hr />

The totems based on there elements needs to do something at all time such as the totem itself should all have a base effect. Like all totems gives resistance based on that class. if you put out any <br />
<br />
water totems they should heal/mana. if you put out any <br />
earth totem they should give str/defence-nature resistance.<br />
fire it should give fire resist/ possible attack.<br />
wind should increase all forms of haste and/or reduce movement impairing effects.<br />
<br />
besides the fact the totems them selfs should all have a base effect along with what ever you called them out for stoneclaw, fire nova, tremor, ect...ect...<br />
<br />
out totems just dont do enough. The second issue is the fact there crappy HP is an issue for pvp. along with crappy totem stomping macros the totems just isnt making the major difference. it would be nice if a totem is killed in combat that it should refresh its own CD or respawn at your feet.</div></div><hr />

A way to quickly and efficiently drop all four of my shaman's totems without leaving me using a macro like the one I have for Totem Of Wrath/Stoneskin Totem/Wrath of Air Totem/Mana Spring Totem (if you couldn't tell, my shaman is Elemental-spec). And Call of Air and Water respectively are good too, like if someone's already using the toems I'm using I could plonk down some others for other buffs. Like, if someone's using the same totem loadout as me, I could plonk down Strength Of Earth/Windfury/Healing Spring/Flametongue or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unlike most of the whiners, this guy really has a very good point in his post. I agree completely, it just doesnt feel like shamans need to drop the totems when there are many other buffs overwriting them or doing the same job already. Also, totems are still really weak in arenas, one good solution would be simply giving them more health. For example, warlock meets a priest with fear ward. He HAS to waste that first fear, there is no other way. In another example, warlock meets shaman who puts tremor totem on the ground. Easy, just put your pet to destroy it and fear the shaman. <br />
<br />
If making totems stronger is not an option, then they need some major buffs so they would be better than the RELIABLE buffs that other classes give.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure it will make shamans a bit more powerful in dumbass faceroll Naxxramas, but who cares (it's for alts and scrubs). The real number games, and buffs and nerfs come from challenging content. <br />
<br />
As for decreasing the jump loss to 40% it still sounds a bit weak, maybe I'm wrong. So I did this in meh brain. <br />
<br />
6500&lt;4000&lt;2400&lt;1500, with CH glyph. That's what the average 2400healing CH hits for, it still feels weak. Since without changes it would look like.<br />
<br />
6500&lt;3250&lt;1625&lt;812ish, Well actually that doesn't look half bad... Changing it to say 35% would probably make it a little too powerful... <br />

AHH YES IT IS. I'll use a simple fight like Emalon. Assuming the group has brains people spread out 10Y (like 99% of fights where people spread out). I think Your looking for it to jump from the melee group to range or some crap. The increase jump range is awesome.</div></div><hr />

Lets hope were never OP, every time we seem OP we get destroyed. And I don't want to end up like paladins or DKs where there is a thousand noobs on each server at any time, trolling, ruining pugs, screwing people over while solo'ing. If that happens I will probably have to reroll.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im not saying shamans will or will not be OP after 3.2, but we dont know enough about the upcoming changes to speculate about shaman future.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fail, I already outheal every other healer in my guild. These changes mean that I will faceroll heal them out of existence. The boost to chain jump is more than a 25% increase when you factor in 2 extra yards over 8 (more because of the way area covered increases compared to radius) at a loss of only 20% of the effectiveness to each jump. Personally I like the idea of being able to hit more targets and as long as it remains above 30%, it's more advantageous to cast than a Healing Wave. More interestingly though is that with the change to Water Shield and the talent, Shamen will be encouraged to go for Int/Spell/Crit/Haste for maximum output for just about the same reason Paladin's are encouraged to gear for Int and crit. The increased amount of healing from Crits will counter that. Most shaman are producing under their potential because we still don't have a definitive &quot;this is how you will heal&quot; document so most of them are just gearing haphazardly and trying to follow silly RT/LHW/LWH/CH cycles. In the meantime Blizz seems to be growing us back toward Chain Heal facerolling instead of giving us reasons to cast the other spells. <br />
<br />
And as for the idiot that says you can just stamp the &quot;drop all&quot; button to counter pet/totem macros, most of the PvP totems live on cooldowns. Hitting the button to drop all will likely set you up for failure. There is still too much utility to be dealt with those totems as well and pet macros are still too powerful to counter them. In PvE I often don't want to drop all totems in one spot either due to range restrictions (Healing Stream comes to mind needing to be a lot closer to the tank than I need to be in most fights). This is still not a fix for &quot;totem&quot; issues. <br />
<br />
And on top of all of this, the resto tree STILL has no offensive power save for 5% crit to lightning spells while some of the other healers get boosts to offensive spells in addition to their heals. It'd be nice to be able stay resto while I farm, but as of right now I need to dual spec into elemental to get any power for my dailies.</div></div><hr />

I agree, if you can beat other healers in isolated situations then we as a class are fine. Who cares what the top guilds and shamans say, as well as the majority of the class. Douchbagary out of the way, the way it is now Druids and Priests have the potential to heal more than shamans on most fights in endgame. That is a fact, player skill should not be our only hope for healing better than other healers. I would like to know what fights you do where you outheal any of the druids/priests and people do not die, a WWS mabey. Because if I top the heals as a shaman in a fight like...say Hodir or Mimiron(the later in p2 is a good example) then people are dying.</div></div><hr />

all hit with no crits<br />

way it is now with Glyph<br />

1st target 8,000 heal------&gt;2nd 4,000-------&gt;3rd 2,000-------&gt;4th 1,000 = 15,000<br />

new with glyph<br />

1st target 8,000 heal------&gt;2nd 4,800-------&gt;3rd 2,880-------&gt; 4th 1,728 =17,408<br />
<br />
<br />
that is about a 16% increase in healing.<br />
<br />
Now I know the mechanics of my illustration may not be perfect but it would be more than 10%. Oh and the 2 extra yards may make a bigger difference than you realize.</div></div><hr />

What he was trying to point out mostly is that not all the changes have been announced and released, so hold your horses before you start up your whine-O-matic.<br />

<br />
<br />
Reducing CD on nature's swiftness is not good then? And increased healing on lesser healing wave.<br />
<br />
There was also a blue post a few days ago about making ES harder to dispel (dispel 1 charge at a time). <br />
<br />
I really don't see how someone can be upset or not happy with these changes.<br />
<br />
p.s. there are enough resto shamans with high rating</div></div><hr />

I am not a shaman, but this sounds awesome and is just what shamans have wanted for a long time. But I guess that's not enough for ppl who want some seriosly OP skills or just plain complain about any changes related to their class, even if they would be good.<br />
<br />

<br />
Exactly. You're not a shaman. What the fuck are you posting for? This doesn't affect you. Wow holy shit I don't have to spend 4.5 sec more puttin down totems. All the laZy ass people love this new change. This isn't gonna do shit for pvp. Any high rating resto shaman always has their cd totems on cd, so instant cast four totems doesn't even affect us but maybe in once the entire match. Let's say my opposing comp is Mage rogue. By the time they attack I already have my totems down. How does this totem bar save me when they open up? If they are good, they'll kill me before I'm out of the kidney shot/deep freeze. A pally gets to bubble. Priest pain supress/fear/penance. Druids genarally have hots up and shape shift out of there. A shaman? Sure you can trinket NS/TF/HW macro but that's only 6k health and your restunned and you die. Oh wait I'll press my totem bar and absorb one shot from the mages pet. That'll fucking save me huh?<br />
<br />
Gh bliz on Imp resto pvp. Enhance is op as shit too. Hope the more to come is more then &quot; you can name your totem bar spells and make them different icons!&quot;</div></div><hr />

Assuming the group has brains people spread out 10Y (like 99% of fights where people spread out). I think Your looking for it to jump from the melee group to range or some crap. The increase jump range is awesome.<br />
<br />
<br />
Unfortunately not all fights are as easy as emalon. Comparing emalon to let's say some ulduar hard modes (mimiron, freya etc.) 10 yards is not enough. I'm not saying to get infinte range or some crap like that.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mistrblank</div><div class="date">2009-06-18, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, if you can beat other healers in isolated situations then we as a class are fine. Who cares what the top guilds and shamans say, as well as the majority of the class. Douchbagary out of the way, the way it is now Druids and Priests have the potential to heal more than shamans on most fights in endgame. That is a fact, player skill should not be our only hope for healing better than other healers. I would like to know what fights you do where you outheal any of the druids/priests and people do not die, a WWS mabey. Because if I top the heals as a shaman in a fight like...say Hodir or Mimiron(the later in p2 is a good example) then people are dying.<br />
<br />
<br />
EVERY FIGHT. I know a heal meter isn't the end all but I don't outgear the other healers and the other healers I'm with aren't incompetent. But regardless I top effective output, I come in low on overhealing. Hodir is easy given that our strat puts everyone very close together already, Chain Heal is already a win in that fight. People aren't dying there, people are taking the massive area of effect damage that is unavoidable and I'm popping off heals in higher efficiency than most (800 haste and 4 piece Tier 8/8.5 is amazing for Chain Heal). <br />
<br />
It's an ability to adapt your gear, adapt your play style and know what to cast and when to cast it. I'm not casting Chain Heal 80 or 90% of the time. I'm casting it when it's necessary. I'm casting LHW when I can toss it out over the raid on dispersed fights (someone has gotten a debuff during XT). I'm casting Healing Waves at our tanks in lulls for raid damage or when a big hit is incoming (Fusion Punch on Steelbreaker). And I'm not running out of Mana, in most fights I've still got my Potion available at the end or Mana Tide off of cooldown. If I'm keeping my targets/responsibilities alive, I'm not running out of mana, I'm tossing out heals to help the other healers, what else is there? On some fights I've even worked DPS (as pathetic as it may be) into my efforts. <br />
<br />
I work my butt off to get where I am in value for my raid and the problem I have is that most of the Shamen I hear complaining, are the ones that still can't get over the fact that we have more tools than facerolling Chain Heal all fight. I don't want it easy. I want a challenge that pushes me to get better. <br />
<br />
Yes, I am happy to finally see the increase in jump distance on Chain Heal, but I didn't want or ask for the other changes to the spell that are going to push my capabilities through the roof in both output and mana efficiency. The jump increase in Chain Heals output can be anywhere from 25% to 60% increase depending on your outlook alone followed by up to 30% more output from the bounces. And it's &quot;fixing&quot; an aspect of our healing that wasn't necessarily broken to begin with without helping the areas that Blizz themselves have admitted are problem areas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shaman still will take ridiculous amounts of damage due to the nerf to armor &amp; defense. The totems are not the key to a shaman's victory in PvP. There are only 3 totems that work in that case. Earthbind,Grounding and Tremor totem. Grounding works on people who arent even around you due to the nerf making it less useful for the shaman for starters.<br />
<br />
Earthbind and frostshock and Frostbrand have to be unnerfed to 75% and Buffed to 80%-85% due to the buffs in movement speed other classes and mobs have had. Shaman are not up to date even today.<br />
<br />
The nerfs to Windfury is one of the primary problems. The second is the armor. The thrid if defense is suppose to be higher than any classes in the game but that was nerfed. then you have the pointless nerfs to 2h weapons. <br />
<br />
Then you have the issues with Meaning less buffs to other classes. That do not match the design of the game itself. Rogues using axes. The constant nerfing to Orcs and refusal to add 1 handed axes to the game due to Developements out right hated of shaman. And yes it hated. They buff warriors Mages and Rogues to outlandish levels. Then paladins then DK come along with 4 pets stuns snares that can immoblize for a few seconds and call it balanced. <br />
<br />
<br />
Seriously do you believe that making totems more valible is fixing shaman for PvP? Then nerfing Enhancements melee?<br />
<br />
The truth is Blizzard is afraid of Enhancement shaman and want them gone. Yet allow Warriors,Death Knights and Rogues and other fast on demand attacks and spells yet shaman ( Based on luck) being stuck with virtually no abilities that funtion in the game or work when you want them too?</div></div><hr />

First off ghost wolf allowing you to have permanent freedom while your partner snares their dps is just amazing for those pesky pve geared rogues and desecration spamming DKs.<br />
<br />
As for the people complaining about getting stunned by a rogue and ret and getting killed let me say that at this time in 3.1 I can some times survive a pve geared rogue and pve geared ret on me stunning me so long as your partner doesn't suck he can CC them off you. And I play with a warrior for 2s who's CCs consist of fear and disarm and stuns...<br />
<br />
Add into the mixture we get 7% more HP, and the new version of natures guardian talent, my survival ability has definitely sky rocketed. After I survive the stun locks with the help of the new talents and HP inc, as well as my partner help, I will use the new Tidal Waves to get those much needed crit heals in to survive, then ghost wolf out of crip poison, forcing them to go onto my warrior, (or w/e class you're with).<br />
<br />
So stop crying about these changes, on top of all that mana regen has also gone up since Tidal Waves inc crit = more mana from water shield.<br />
<br />
Our survial is up, our healing through Tidal Waves is up, our mana regen is up. Even totem stomping macros which were a huge disadvantage, has also been fixed. If ANY Shaman dares complain about this, is either ignorant on purpose, or doesn't fully understand the way this class works and where our flaws are in arena.<br />
<br />
Obviously to survive a pve geared ret and rogue like I said you need decent gear, not 18k hp, and still in the stages of &quot;OMFG 2 shot by a ret/rogue/dk again!&quot;</div></div><hr />

At the other hand i hate druid healers right now.. with the new resilence and even let's say 10% less dmg dealt to them... they are impossible to kill, right now I take about 5 mins to kill a druid healer with full s7 gear (except 3 set pieces and with 1850 weapons). If this won't be fixed .. enhancement will still suck against ervery druid team, even with an ms partner. Our cc is worthless vs druids.. (okay, we will be able to purge their manareg again), but i really hate it to see how a druid heals in pvp gear and reggs mana while i'm hitting at him all the time, and he only needs to use his hots, no casts.. yeah nice!.. go druid /godmode on!<br />
So totem fixes might be nice for healers and elemental shamans, but what's about enhancement?... new 1 min cd on shamanistic rage isn't nessessary... i play retri enhancement in 2vs2 and right now i'll survive much longer then him if focussed... so the problem is not the dmg done to us, but the dmg and cc we do!... <br />
sry, had to mention this before the new heal shaman hype overwhelmes enhancement again :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
These changes are not the best Blizzard can offer shaman. Having the ability to use a move to counter another ability is one thing. But these are not changes that help you in PvP. You still die in 4-6 seconds of combat. Which means in mass PvP you wont get off GW because your stunned that 4-6 seconds and are dead during one stun if not 2. You try to run they just sprint or use a ranged attack and kill you.<br />
Thus You fail.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

And I play with a warrior for 2s who's CCs consist of fear and disarm and stuns...<br />
Having one poorly geared rogue does not qualify as fixed. It still falls under not working effectively. If a DK comes up against you and a Druid or rogue or anyone comes at you, your<br />
as good as dead.<br />
<br />
Even poorly geared classes use stuns effectively on shaman. Why? Because the class spec cannot resist attacks. So to be given a ability that can only be activated after an effect your just wasting time trying to stay alive. It's not complicated.It is just simple. You cant counter a move due to it not working while stunned or on a Global CD.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Add into the mixture we get 7% more HP, and the new version of natures guardian talent, my survival ability has definitely sky rocketed. After I survive the stun locks with the help of the new talents and HP inc, as well as my partner help,<br />
<br />
<br />
A bunch of crap! Look its simple. If a shamans base armor is not equal to gear of another class -10% in health its not fixed. Just that simple.If a Raid DK can go 30000 health then a shaman can go 28000 health. If a PvP DK can go 25000 then a Shaman can go 22000. If they dont then it isn't fixed. <br />
<br />
Not to mention the armor issue i have said before. How much armor does each class have naked. Then look at shaman. You cant calculate how much base armor migrates your damage if you have NO base armor and only the armor generated from Agility. Because it does not calculate.<br />
<br />
<br />
I will use the new Tidal Waves to get those much needed crit heals in to survive, then ghost wolf out of crip poison, forcing them to go onto my warrior, (or w/e class you're with).<br />
<br />
??? Well LA DE DA! If i was actually a elemental or restoration even i wouldnt give a damn about that because mana is based on a % of your mana pool which means no matter how much you increase it you still use up more mana than needed! So thats not a buff or fix or anything. its a slap in the face for people who don't know about the issue with the class!Making the mana cost a base percent of the mana pool was a bad idea before and it is a bad idea now!<br />
<br />
<br />
Our survial is up, our healing through Tidal Waves is up, our mana regen is up. Even totem stomping macros which were a huge disadvantage, has also been fixed. If ANY Shaman dares complain about this, is either ignorant on purpose, or doesn't fully understand the way this class works and where our flaws are in arena.<br />
<br />
Not even in the least is it up. It's still exactly the same. You wont last 10 seconds in a battleground or in Arena as a Enh shaman. When you say survivability is up you only mean one spec of the class which is only for raiding. So NO!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Obviously to survive a pve geared ret and rogue like I said you need decent gear, not 18k hp, and still in the stages of &quot;OMFG 2 shot by a ret/rogue/dk again!&quot;<br />
Are you serious? Let me tell you whats it like. Your hit with a stun.(You normaly cannot resist stuns) Hit for 3500 in 1 second 5100 in the next second,2800 the next second, then the paladin comes. And hit you for 8000 damage crit. <br />
<br />
Now during this time your most likely stacking 800 resilience and every piece of gear you have is resilience gear. Your just taking too much damage during the stun. But be you in or out of the stun your suffering MASSIVE damage in combat. Then stopping to heal off the damage. You dont have MW up so you cant instant heal.<br />
<br />
Thats because blizzard moved Nature Swiftness higher in the restoration tree so other shaman couldnt spec it. It was to intentionaly NERF TO shaman. No matter how you say were going to give you need things and buff your class. NONE of this fixes the current issues.<br />
<br />
So you try to heal and get hit for the low damage 2000 here 3000 there and your dead. <br />
<br />
You during that time cannot move and are trying to spam heals on yourself. Your heals are not up to date. You healing should only take 2Healing ways and 1 lesser Healing way to cap out your health which means in good gear you should be healing NON CRIT for 9500 PER HEAL! I cannot make that more obvious! You SUCK! YOU SUCK YOU SUCK YOU SUCK! You KNOW you suck and yet you constantly try to fight people knowing you cant kill more than one target at a time and its a desperate struggle! Please do not insult the shaman community with these pack of ... just .... just LIES! UGH!</div></div><hr />

People get sick of constantly trying to tell Blizzard in there blillion dollar corp to fix the issues and then end up getting nerfed and there abilities given to other classes. Free action potion went to paladins. Higher armor druids and all the other good abilities like Flametounge Mortal strike and i forget the other name of the move that gives Maces stuns damage and Axes Crit.<br />
<br />
<br />
It was removed due to them NOT wanting shaman fixed. So when you say People dont know what shaman can do. Most dont and they will try to tell you these lies about how new abiltities fix shaman. The truth is They nerfed everything that was working fine. <br />
<br />
You went from a class working fine with only one issue mana regeneration for raiding from patch 1.9 to having the singel worst class in any game in 5 contries and was declared to be the least respected coperation in the gaming world. <br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard right now is MORE hated 2 times over than ATARI! Thats just friggin sad!</div></div><hr />
