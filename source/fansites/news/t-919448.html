Q: Vengeance is a great tool to help raid tanks hold aggro over DPS, but in 5-man heroics it doesn't stack high enough to keep up with the threat generated by overgeared DPS burst damage. Are there any plans to address this? Are there any plans to help warriors put out more initial threat before Vengeance has been ramped up? – Nikelsndimes (NA), Cémanana (EU-FR), Arthur (TW), Mancake (NA), Migol (NA)<br />
<br />
A: We think Vengeance works well overall. It provides sufficient threat without causing the tank to do more DPS than the dedicated DPS characters, and doesn’t let the tank just neglect abilities that cause threat. A full stack of Vengeance probably provides too much threat, but we didn’t think it was necessary to nerf that mid-expansion. Overall, we don’t want tanks to have 100% guaranteed threat on a pull, so we don’t want to buff that aspect of Vengeance, but we also don’t want DPS specs to constantly have to throttle the DPS they can deliver midway through a fight, so we have to strike a balance.<br />
<br />
Note: There are fights with tank swaps or incoming adds, or similar mechanics, when threat may matter mid-fight. This is intended – encounter design varies widely.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Have you considered normalizing initial Rage for feral druid tanks? For example, when a warrior uses Charge, it generates 15 points of Rage, which lets them use another aggro generating ability quickly, something that Feral druids tend to be a bit short on. Why in Cataclysm was the bear bonus health pool was reduced, as well? Their survivability always depended on the amount of health since they don’t have parry or shield block. Do you have any plans to improve bear tanking in the future? At the moment, it’s considered to be the weakest tank. Have you considered giving druid tanks an additional tool to pull casters at range? It’s the only tank class that doesn’t have a talent or spell to help in those situations. – Pødêrøsø (LA), Вирко (EU-RU), Амелья (EU-RU), Condenacion (EU-ES), Whitewnd (KR)<br />
<br />
A: Bears are getting a significant mitigation buff in 4.2 and we’re retuning their damage such that it’s a little easier to hold aggro at low gear levels, and a little harder at higher gear levels. While we definitely don’t expect the community to ever agree on anything, we’ve seen little evidence of a widespread concurrence that druids are “the weakest tank.” There are plenty of druid tanks out there, handling everything from Grim Batol to Sinestra. Tank balance overall is in a really good place. Players may focus on potential problems that could arise in the future but we also have ample time to address those problems should they occur. Gone are the days when we would just release a class into the wild and refuse to touch it again until the next expansion. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: What are your intentions with each tank's mastery and mastery in general? – Migol (NA)<br />
<br />
A: Mastery is intended to be a defensive stat for tanks. We want it to be at least in the same ballpark of value per rating as avoidance. To go into a bit more depth on each tank:<br />
<br />
Death Knights: We’re pretty happy with how mastery has turned out. It does have the oddity that it scales down in value with your mitigation, but also up in value with your health. But it does indeed scale up pretty smoothly in value, and doesn’t have any unintuitive breakpoints or anything, so we’re happy with it.<br />
<br />
Druids: We’re pretty happy with how mastery has turned out. It scales well, doesn’t have any unintuitive or unfortunate interactions with other stats, and provides solid performance value.<br />
<br />
Paladins: Mastery is an attractive stat for paladins, but has some design problems. It scales very well, but due to the nature of our combat tables (and being able to “fill them up”), you can get “block capped,” which is a massive performance benefit. Worse, Protection mastery scales with itself, since there are no diminishing returns on block chance, and the amount of rating you need to block cap goes down as your dodge and parry improve, allowing you to put even more of your stats into dodge or parry. This sort of feedback loop is something we always try to stay away from, so we plan to change this in the future. We tried several alternatives for 4.2, but weren’t happy with the results. Any change which made mastery weaker (such as subjecting block to diminishing returns or changing what it does) would have required mitigation compensation for paladins elsewhere (with all the design risks inherent in making such changes), as well as asking many players to extensively re-gem or re-forge. We’ll ask players to do that when the need is great, but we didn’t think this problem crossed that line. The major risks are that Protection paladins become too powerful or too weak or that gear with mastery will at some point be rejected once characters are over the cap. We don’t think any of those problems will manifest themselves in the 4.2 content.<br />
<br />
Warriors: Warriors’ mastery is in a similar boat as paladins’, except that it still provides a notable benefit past the cap and scales much slower, making it much more difficult to “block cap.” That delays, but doesn’t remove the problem. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Will we see a tanking Legendary sometime soon? – Pedoso (NA)<br />
<br />
A: The tanking community both loves and hates when this question comes up, but it received a lot of votes, so we’ll answer it. The answer is not soon, but probably eventually. The problem with tanking legendaries, of course, is that the shield-users and non-shield-users tank with different weapons. That’s not a deal breaker, but it is a consideration. We could allow the legendary to be transformed from a one-hander to two-hander or we could just design an item for a more narrow audience (such as a shield). The 4.2 legendary has fairly wide appeal, and the 4.3 legendary will have much more narrow appeal. We don’t want to fall into the trap of making legendaries too formulaic. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Are there any plans to teach players in-game how to tank when they are at an early stage, or at least at some point in the leveling process? – Romner (EU-EN)<br />
<br />
A: A system to teach players how we intend for them to perform their roles is something we realize we’re lacking. We have some pretty cool plans to help solve this problem in the future, but we’re not quite ready to make any announcements, and Ask the Devs just wouldn’t be the appropriate venue anyway. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Do you plan to bring other tanks to the same level as Death Knights who have a lot of advantages over other tanking classes (easier to heal, quite a number of various safe abilities, etc.)? - Меланори (EU-RU)<br />
<br />
A: Death knights are a somewhat different style of tank compared to the others. They take significantly more damage than other tanks, but then heal/shield that extra damage back instead (and sometimes more). Due to taking more damage, and that damage coming in spikes, they’re also the most likely to die to unexpected burst (such as when they don’t have runes up to Death Strike, have no cooldowns available, and fail to dodge or parry a few attacks in a row. They also have more personal impact on their own survivability and mitigation than any other tank, by tying much of their performance to Death Strike (and especially optimally timing their Death Strikes). So in the hands of a really skilled player, they can do some amazing things, but not usually much better than the other tanks. We’d actually like to head more in that direction with the other tanks (making them tie more of their defensive performance to their ability usage), in the future. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Is there any chance that we can see damage reduction numbers being used in the statistic UI, just like shield absorb amount of Discipline priest? – 首領先生 (TW)<br />
<br />
A: The default UI should show the damage reduction from armor against a creature of equal level. We’ll look into also showing the damage reduction against a +1, +2, +3/boss-level mob, like we do for hit or expertise. Beyond that, there is typically passive damage reduction from talents/stance/presence/etc., which should be relatively easy to combine with armor to find your damage reduction. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Have you ever considered adjusting DPS HP? Seems that while their large pools of health help them on &quot;accidental&quot; situations, a fair portion of the time they can take aggro and tank adds without consequence. – Jainel (LA)<br />
<br />
A: We’re generally happy with how well DPS are able to tank (which is to say, not very well). We like that they can take a hit or two (depending upon content) before dying, and that the penalty for that happening is a huge drain on healer mana. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: As far as I remember, about five tanks were required in a 25-man group in Burning Crusade. However, the number of tanks in raids has been decreased to one or two since WotLK. I think this is one of the reasons heroic parties suffer from lack of tanks. What if raids have required more tanks? – **한니발 (KR)<br />
<br />
A: We don’t actually recall many four+ tank fights in Burning Crusade, and that includes fights like High King Maulgar where non-tanks could perform the tanking role. While we do find some elegance in a design where a 5-player group scales perfectly up to a 10 and 25-player group, that introduces some problems as well. It could potentially extend the tank shortage we see in 5-player dungeons up to raids (to be fair, it’s also possible needing more tanks for raiding would create more tanks for dungeons). A larger problem is that we just don’t want to over-constrain encounter design to always require 4 or 5 tanks. Sometimes it’s nice to have a fight that’s just a single bruiser without requiring a tank swap or meteor-style cleave. Nearly every raid fight in Cataclysm asks for two tank-specced characters, with a few requiring one or three. That’s likely the model we will continue to use. If we wanted to do a fight with many tanks, we’d likely let some of the DPS specs step in. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q:Are there any plans to update the leg armor in 4.2 now that the plate tanks receive no dodge from agility? Maybe introduce a new leg armor patch that adds str/stamina, or a mastery/stamina? – Dariok (NA), Fredik (EU-ES)<br />
<br />
A: We did. As you’ve probably seen by now, it’s called Drakehide Leg Armor, and it provides Stamina and dodge rating. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Can you make it so that taunt doesn't miss, just like you did for interrupt abilities? Doesn't feel as though it would be a complete upset to overall balance. – Madmartygan (LA)<br />
<br />
A: Yes, absolutely! And in fact we did it back in patch 3.9. Tank classes’ taunts have been unable to miss since then. We recognize that tanks will nearly always choose mitigation stats over threat stats and it’s particularly frustrating to have to reach a hit cap just to make sure taunts or interrupts don’t miss, which is why we no longer require that. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Are there any plans to simplify the impossible situation for tanks (8% hit rating, 26 Expertise but all defensive stats at max at the same time) somehow, either through stats on gear or through changes to the game mechanics? Have you considered giving tools to tanks to allow easier capping of hit and expertise to help with threat management? – Sunyara (EU-DE), Gilbey (EU-ES)<br />
<br />
A: We don’t currently balance around the assumption that tanks cap hit or expertise. We’re definitely looking at ways to make reliably hitting more attractive to tanks in the future, though. Currently, missing is just a compound to the issue discussed in Question #1. Getting tanks to care about threat stats, not for the threat benefit (but for a mitigation benefit), is one potential direction. For example, DKs want to make sure their Death Strikes hit because of the mitigation benefit. Druids care about crit because of Savage Defense. We speculated at one point that we could make Shield Block (and now Holy Shield) require a successful hit to do their jobs. We’re not sure we will go that direction, but it’s one idea. We would of course compensate tanks for any potential loss of predictable mitigation. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Compared to DKs, Paladins are weaker when facing mass magic attacks. A Paladin has no choice but to stack stamina in this situation. Is there any change coming to this for Paladins? – 新垣綾瀨 (TW)<br />
<br />
A: We don’t balance tanks around their sustained magic damage reduction, since we don’t typically assault tanks with continuous magic damage. We do frequently intersperse physical damage with a burst of magic damage, usually timed around the cooldowns that all tanks have available, and find that that is balanced. If we ever did a fight like Hydross again where there is almost no physical damage, we’d have to explore some other options. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: At the moment, tanks need to use addons to see threat levels and clearly see which mobs they have aggro with. With all the recent changes and updates being made to the UI, are there any plans to make seeing threat levels and aggro easier and clearer? – Castan (EU-EN)<br />
<br />
A: We’d definitely like to build threat into the UI more, especially for tanks and for multiple targets. We try to keep our default UI relatively unobtrusive so that players can see the actual battlefield, but we realize this design goal can come into conflict with players’ need or desire to have copious amounts of information displayed. Finding the right compromise is something we wrestle with constantly and one reason why our UI changes tend to come more slowly than, say, class design changes. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Protection Paladin is not only the most desired tank because survival abilities for groups and various utilities, but players also generally consider Paladins as an indispensable Class in raids. I know all tanking Classes are being equalized constantly, but survival abilities of Protection Paladins give huge advantages compared to other tanking Classes. Can we expect that other Tanking classes will see more survival abilities for groups in terms of equity? – 디**르테 (KR)<br />
<br />
A: Like druids, paladins have the enormous benefit of being able to fill all three roles in a group. Paladins also retain a wide variety of buff and utility abilities from vanilla when they (and shaman) were more of a support class that was intended to have low individual throughput but made other classes in the group shine. We have been slowly moving away from that design in our effort to avoid class stacking and support the “bring the player, not the class” philosophy, but it’s hard to move quickly on changes like this. (As one small example, we briefly removed Lay on Hands during Cataclysm development, and there was an outcry even from within the team.) Because they can fill many roles and still provide a lot of utility, it’s not surprising that you see a lot of druids and paladins in your raid groups. We’ve tried very hard to not make any particular tank class mandatory, and we feel we’ve been pretty successful in Cataclysm. So far we haven’t seen an encounter like Sartharion or Anub’arak where a certain tank class was perceived, probably accurately, as necessary for progression.<br />
<br />
Protection paladins do bring a lot of utility, but it is quite difficult to make a table comparing a paladin’s Divine Guardian to a Protection warrior’s mobility or a bear druid’s ability to cast Innervate or even Rebirth during lulls in an encounter. They are fundamentally different abilities that have greater or less utility depending on the encounter and your individual raid comp. We don’t want to just hand out a Divine Guardian equivalent to every tank class, just like we don’t think warriors or paladins need the ability to battle rez. It’s a fine line to walk. Homogenization really rankles some players (as it should), but being unable to tank (or heal, or DPS) an encounter because of lack of tools is equally unacceptable to many players. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Is there any plan to add a new tank class in the future? I think spell breaker in the Warcraft III is an awesome choice for that! – 聖淇淋 (TW)<br />
<br />
A: We’ll add new classes when the time is right. We don’t see WoW as a game that can support unlimited different class types (and the different talent specs almost behave as full classes these days!), so we want to be judicious about when we add classes. One of the challenges with tanks (and other roles) especially, is this: on the one hand, there is a core set of abilities that any tank needs in order to perform their job, especially in a 5-player dungeon where you can’t rely on other players in the same role to help cover your deficiencies. On the other hand, having so many similar abilities (e.g. a taunt, a short cooldown, an efficient heal) necessitates a certain amount of homogeneity among those classes. But what players (and designers!) really want in a new class is something exciting that no one has seen before. Adding another class that tanked just like a warrior wouldn’t add much to the game – it wouldn’t drive many new tanks or encourage a veteran tank to try a different tanking class. On the other hand, adding the death knight, who tanks relatively differently (though some players might argue still not differently enough) was an enormous challenge and the kind of thing we continue to tweak over time.</div></div><hr />

What is the point in having different classes for tanking if you want them to have the same abilities and benefits as the other tanks, why not just make 1 tank class and that is it.<br />
<br />
I have no idea why there are so many &quot;stupid&quot; questions coming from people saying X class has this when can we see Y class gaining this benefits. The point of playing a Druid tank is the abilities you get as a Bear, same thing with DK/Paladin/Warrior. They are individual classes and have different ways of dealing with different situations, it would make the game incredibly boring to have all the tank classes have access to do what every other tank class has.<br />
<br />
I just want to see more intelligent questions being asked instead of mundane childish questions wasting space for real questions.<br />
<br />
I play a Bear tank, Paladin tank and a DK tank and I don't have problems tanking with any of the classes, one class has an advantage over a certain situation than another tank class, but that other tank class has advantages that the others don't. Stop complaining and adapt, it's annoying to hear people wanting to make the class easier to play because they don't want to improve and learn.<br />

/pray for hunter bow<br />
<br />
Won't be a hunter bow, (Thori'dal was it, accept it hunters) but could be an agi staff. The only &quot;narrow appeal&quot; weapons left are either a 1h tank legendary, a 1h agi legendary, and a 2h agi legendary. Most likely it'll be the 2h agi legendary since the 1h agi would need at least 3 different iterations for rogues and enhance shamans, and the tanking legendary would also need 3 different types. So I'm guessing legendary agi polearm. <br />
<br />
What concerns me is that in the previous 2 expansions, the 2nd legendary came at the very last tier of the expansion. I hope that blizzard does not expect us to be satisfied with 3 tiers of content for 2 years. Hopefully they are either changing this so that the legendary classes can have more use, and the final tier will not have a legendary, or there will be 3 legendaries this expansion. Only other option is to have the next xpac come out early next year, and that won't happen.</div></div><hr />

and why not? they said it will be very narrow, compared to 4.2, and 4.2 is for mages, shadow priests, boomkins, warlocks, elemental shamans... that's 5 classes, &quot;very narrow&quot; compared to that goes down to 2-3 classes/specs</div></div><hr />

1.Remove hit for tanks<br />
2.Make hit vital for tanks<br />
<br />
Either one will make me happy because at the moment having to pick between the two is starting of **** me off im a oldschool Paladin tank since 2.2 so ive always tryed to stay either on the hit cap or within .3% of it to ensure i dont get screwed on threat by some noob who blows cooldowns before all the debuffs are applied to the boss to gain maximum outcomes of damage instead they just want to see big numbers at the start and make threat a pain in the backside</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm a healer and I'd rather they penalized the healers than having people die which likely penalizes the whole group. However, they could certainly have standing in stuff also penalize personal dps, not only do you take damage but it locks your action buttons for 10 seconds, dps would probably get a lot better at staying outta stuff very quickly.</div></div><hr />

&quot;The 4.2 legendary has fairly wide appeal, and the 4.3 legendary will have much more narrow appeal.&quot;<br />

Pretty much, and why on earth did they pick the two questions from completely uninformed people. Yes taunts no longer miss and if they do it was either b/c you're bad and hit the wrong button or the other tank didn't stop attacking and reaggroed. Also the 5 tank setup was using a few dps as tanks, any 25 man that brought 5 true tanks to help beat the boss was doing it wrong.</div></div><hr />

It has nothing to do with general paladin utility. It has to do with a singular ability that simplifies several fights. Bubble.

<br />
PS We waited two weeks for this?!<br />
<br />
main warrior alt paladin tank. both raiding heroic content. I was hugely disapointed not to see the qaustion about warrior threat being so much lower then paladins, and paladins being lower then DKs. it'd dispicable how much threat DKs generate on the pull with abiities that cannot be dodged/parried while us paladins/warriors go &quot;aww hell CS missed twice in a row sigh&quot; or &quot;shield slam missed and is not recastable when it misses&quot; etc...misses/parries are really the bane of pull threat, but doing calculations you'd literally have to reforge EVERY peice of gear you have into hit/expertise to even get the 26/8 goal, and that won't even solve the parry problem. I miss when tanks got passive expertise in their tree just for being a class that had to dps from the front all the time. :\<br />
<br />
the answer to the vengeance question was also dodgy at best. they said apsolutely nothing whenever someone asks about that. pull threat isn't just dicey for 10 seconds, on my warrior doing everything right on a pull, can simply get unlucky and not have control of threat for a full minute, and you can't taunt when someoen pulls either cause the temp threat is still higher then the person who is already over 110, so you can't taunt until that drops, and hope you're fsat enough not to let that frost dk or ret paladin die. or maybe you strike up a deal with mage buddy to go all out on pull with image up, way pass your threat, then taunt off him for the 1000k lead that gives you. <br />
<br />
at least when it comes to aoe though my warrior rapes the Dks face. my single target threat is lowest of 4 tank classes without a doubt but aoe i haven't met a tank class that can beat blood thunder deep wounds build with double dots on everything, all while cleaving and shockwaving and thunderclaping like mad. then that mob that can disarm shields in BoT kills me cause i had all 6 mobs on me (whats up with that anwyays? before 4.1 he'd only disarm weapon, now weapon and shield making tanking him for a warrior/paladin really suck).<br />

They could've atleast mentioned our occasionall dps increase when we go into cat, which was nice in 10 mans but doesn't do a whole lot in 25s. <br />
<br />
Someone mentioned that people were asking stupid questions and that people should ask smarter questions. <br />
I don't think the devs had a lack of questions to answer, they just chose to answer the ones they wanted and even went as far as putting in a filler question with the taunt to make it look longer. <br />

I agree about the Innervate bit, but it's piss easy in most every fight to safely combat rez someone while tanking. Magmaw head phase, Chimaeron Feud, Dragons during phase change, Cho'Gall on tank swap, etc, etc. Druid Combat rez isn't as easy as DKs' but then the Druid's rez is also infinitely safer due to coming back with full health (= glyph).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Healing a DPS who is standing in the fire, pulling aggro is a poor healing choice and is the penalty to the healer. The fire or monster itself penalizes the DPSer the healer penalizes themselves when they blow their mana healing people standing in the fire.</div></div><hr />

You shouldn't always be able to hold aggro for every situation, when you do that the game does not become interesting and you might as well have a robot play the game if you worry about 5 man trash that way.</div></div><hr />

I wonder if, now here me out, the developers are tired of these Q and As, and they're picking the stupidest questions that have the easiest answers so that they don't have to write very much. I mean why answer thought provoking questions that you may have to retract later on, when you can write 2 paragraphs on why every tanking class is not the worst one in the game atm.

There is simply no need for a tank,healer,DPS class. I would support creating a specific class that was dedicated to CC and whose primary role was CC but adding more of the classes we already have is silly and pointless.<br />

Quite frankly, as a warrior tank the last thing I want is more plate wearing DPSer running around rolling need on tanking gear I can use because they might maybe someday what to try tanking something.</div></div><hr />

i think a pally and dk tank can do much more burst threat than a warrior one ( don't know for druid since i haven't raided with 1 since cataclysm ) and i think that's unfair since that makes raid leaders want to have palladins start as tank so the dps can pewpew from the start.</div></div><hr />

I reckon it will be a tanking weapon/shield designed around class. Same stats (except agi for Str in the case of Druids), same gem slots, only main change would be if it has a proc - how it procs. Maybe dodge (as it's what all tanks have in common) an attack and have a 5% chance for proc to happen. <br />
<br />
Note: This will mean that Blizz have to use defensive stats on a pole arm/staff and a 2H weapon for DKs. As it's a legendary, a one off exception would be acceptable to most players I think. Dodge/Mastery + proc perhaps.<br />
<br />
I would guess the stats would have to have massive armor (yes, incl weapons but scaled back if needed), 3 gem slots, the agi/str/stam mix, dodge, mastery and an uber proc. <br />
<br />
Question is.... what would be an uber proc for Tanks?</div></div><hr />

Hahahaha. So a paladin can put barkskin on the entire raid, the warrior have a lot of mobility (like that would come close), and the druid can give 5k mana to a healer by switching out of bearform while tanking, or combat ress out of form as well.

While we definitely don’t expect the community to ever agree on anything, we’ve seen little evidence of a widespread concurrence that druids are “the weakest tank.” There are plenty of druid tanks out there, handling everything from Grim Batol to Sinestra. Tank balance overall is in a really good place. Players may focus on potential problems that could arise in the future but we also have ample time to address those problems should they occur. Gone are the days when we would just release a class into the wild and refuse to touch it again until the next expansion. <br />
<br />
...Wat? These answers are beyond terrible. They also skipped the more important parts of the question...<br />
<br />
Have you considered normalizing initial Rage for feral druid tanks? Do you have any plans to improve bear tanking in the future? Have you considered giving druid tanks an additional tool to pull casters at range? It’s the only tank class that doesn’t have a talent or spell to help in those situations. <br />
<br />
These are what all the bear tanks I know care about. The toolbox is small and full of garbage/poorly designed abilities. While they can take a hit, they are mind-numbingly boring in comparison. At least Stampeding Fail lasts 8 seconds now...<br />
<br />
Frankly, I really dislike Rebirth being considered so much utility for bears. DKs now have it and easier to use. Warlocks have it. Caster druids bring it and it's better for them, as it doesn't Rez the person in front of the boss without losing an entire rage bar or risking a death. Bears have the crappiest utility by far. Nature's Grasp is really the only thing I can think of without a comparable ability on another tank, and that is so limited it's just silly (Maloriak, P1 Nef).<br />
<br />
Also, did they really suggest a bear innervates someone? /mindblown</div></div><hr />

Are there any plans to address this? Are there any plans to help warriors put out more initial threat before Vengeance has been ramped up? – Nikelsndimes (NA), Cémanana (EU-FR), Arthur (TW), Mancake (NA), Migol (NA)<br />
<br />
A: We think Vengeance works well overall. It provides sufficient threat without causing the tank to do more DPS than the dedicated DPS characters, and doesn’t let the tank just neglect abilities that cause threat. A full stack of Vengeance probably provides too much threat, but we didn’t think it was necessary to nerf that mid-expansion. Overall, we don’t want tanks to have 100% guaranteed threat on a pull, so we don’t want to buff that aspect of Vengeance, but we also don’t want DPS specs to constantly have to throttle the DPS they can deliver midway through a fight, so we have to strike a balance.<br />
<br />
Note: There are fights with tank swaps or incoming adds, or similar mechanics, when threat may matter mid-fight. This is intended – encounter design varies widely.<br />
<br />

Its mostly either A) they arent using their threat reducing abilities or managing their threat meters in lieu of OMFG I NEED TO DEEPS HARDER. B). Your not pumping out the maximum amount of threat, its quite easy.<br />
<br />
The problem many players, and the person asking the question have, is that they don´t understand the purpose of vengeance. Vengeance never had anything to do with burst aggro. The solution in that case is to tell the dps to hold off for a few seconds. Vengeance was created for long fights at the end of a tier where the dps in BIS were being forced to throttle back dps for long periods of time because the tanks couldn´t keep threat because his BIS stuff was all about avoidance.<br />
<br />
I have a bear and a pro pally, I have no problems with either of them.<br />
<br />
I do think they were onto something regarding DKs. I think average tanks for all specs are fairly equal, but I think bad dks are much worse than bad players of other tank specs.</div></div><hr />

Wouldn't really say it's a &quot;ask'n'get&quot; situation, you will need to ask if there are any healing cds ready for you to pop out of bear to cast and wait for a reply, then time it so it won't be at a particularly bad time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A: The default UI should show the damage reduction from armor against a creature of equal level. We’ll look into also showing the damage reduction against a +1, +2, +3/boss-level mob, like we do for hit or expertise. Beyond that, there is typically passive damage reduction from talents/stance/presence/etc., which should be relatively easy to combine with armor to find your damage reduction.<br />

Q: Have you ever considered adjusting DPS HP? Seems that while their large pools of health help them on &quot;accidental&quot; situations, a fair portion of the time they can take aggro and tank adds without consequence. – Jainel (LA)<br />

A: We’re generally happy with how well DPS are able to tank (which is to say, not very well). We like that they can take a hit or two (depending upon content) before dying, and that the penalty for that happening is a huge drain on healer mana.<br />

A: Yes, absolutely! And in fact we did it back in patch 3.9. Tank classes’ taunts have been unable to miss since then. We recognize that tanks will nearly always choose mitigation stats over threat stats and it’s particularly frustrating to have to reach a hit cap just to make sure taunts or interrupts don’t miss, which is why we no longer require that.<br />

That's is the greatest idea I have ever heard! Of course, if you want to strike down a DPS, you lower their damage, not their health. When their numbers are lower, everyone's going to get at them for messing up. When they die, they just blame tank/heals. Brilliant!</div></div><hr />

Many tanks are struggling with threat in pulls of more than 2 monsters. The only way they *aren't* struggling is if they are overgeared, mostly through heirlooms. However tanks beside DK/Paladin will start to &quot;struggle&quot; with AE threat at 70+. This is mainly due the insane damage AE classes are starting to dish out. Especially warriors have a problem with the burst damage. The abilities just do not give enough threat the first 5-6 seconds of the fight. Who cares about raids? They work fine most of the time. It's the 5-man dungeons that are problems with tanks.<br />
<br />
The answers blizzard supplies to many of the topics were laughable. Seriously, did they even read what they wrote. The guy asked about 5-man dungeons and blizzard went on about raids. What a joke. Screw your shitty raids, i'm amazed you even consider that trash &quot;raids&quot;. Hell, what surprise me even more is that you don't let people random raids across servers yet. 10 people... raid... serious roflcopter on that.<br />
<br />
&lt;edit&gt; Blizzard i hope you are aware that WoW will crash and burn the second something decent comes along? It'll be just like back in the days when WoW came around and all the rest just crumbled underneath. Now you are running that &quot;shitty&quot; mmo that people are tired of.</div></div><hr />

It's pretty much the only consistent gear slot used by all 4 tanks that wouldn't need 3 or more different forms of the item and/or couldn't be used by DPS to great effect.<br />
A invisible legendary , not going to happen imo.<br />
if they want to do an other slot it would be a cloack imo , give it stam and dodge , no str or agi but armor or perhaps some (base) vengeance to start with or something to cover the loss of a threat stat and a ofc awesome tanking proc thing.<br />
Voila, a visible tanking legendary they can make all pretty and it's useable by any tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Q: Have you considered normalizing initial Rage for feral druid tanks? For example, when a warrior uses Charge, it generates 15 points of Rage, which lets them use another aggro generating ability quickly, something that Feral druids tend to be a bit short on. Why in Cataclysm was the bear bonus health pool was reduced, as well? Their survivability always depended on the amount of health since they don’t have parry or shield block. Do you have any plans to improve bear tanking in the future? At the moment, it’s considered to be the weakest tank. Have you considered giving druid tanks an additional tool to pull casters at range? It’s the only tank class that doesn’t have a talent or spell to help in those situations. – Pødêrøsø (LA), Вирко (EU-RU), Амелья (EU-RU), Condenacion (EU-ES), Whitewnd (KR)<br />
<br />
A: Bears are getting a significant mitigation buff in 4.2 and we’re retuning their damage such that it’s a little easier to hold aggro at low gear levels, and a little harder at higher gear levels. While we definitely don’t expect the community to ever agree on anything, we’ve seen little evidence of a widespread concurrence that druids are “the weakest tank.” There are plenty of druid tanks out there, handling everything from Grim Batol to Sinestra. Tank balance overall is in a really good place. Players may focus on potential problems that could arise in the future but we also have ample time to address those problems should they occur. Gone are the days when we would just release a class into the wild and refuse to touch it again until the next expansion. <br />
<br />
If there was nothing wrong with bear tanking and there were &quot;plenty of druid tanks&quot; then why are they getting a buff? .... because they needed it and while there were some, it was kind of a &quot;we don't have a choice&quot; for a raid team.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Are there any plans to teach players in-game how to tank when they are at an early stage, or at least at some point in the leveling process? – Romner (EU-EN)<br />
<br />
A: A system to teach players how we intend for them to perform their roles is something we realize we’re lacking. We have some pretty cool plans to help solve this problem in the future, but we’re not quite ready to make any announcements, and Ask the Devs just wouldn’t be the appropriate venue anyway. <br />
<br />
I've said all along that something needs (needed) to be done about heroics and who we let into a heroic and that they are competent to do the task at hand. Some kind of check beyond a gear check is needed for this. Something along the way, call it attunement for tanks, dps and heals, that says they are capable of doing heroics, be that the ability to dodge fire, interrupt, heal multiple targets, etc... I really hope Blizzard is thinking along these lines.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You should if you are good, telling dps to wait, or having tricks of the trade do it for you isn't compelling gameplay imho, not for the dpsers or the tank.<br />
<br />
What we have now is just an obfuscated and gimiky version of the 3 sunders rule from vanilla that most tanks seemed to require.<br />
<br />
I was always bettter than that somehow to the point that my dpsers have always had the ability to repop pots and go balls out on the pull... in cata as gear has increased in our raids I'm less and less able to allow that, even with tricks... while it is possible I'm getting worse at slamming my hand on the keyboard like a hungry chimp, I kind of doubt that.<br />
<br />
...by no means is the current gameplay necessarilly &quot;wrong&quot; just because I don't like it, but it would be nice to have had some output from the devs on the design.<br />

I'd rather have to worry about threat the whole fight than the current model where we have no chance to hold it at first, and no ability to lose it after that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This and this again. In the current high end content, this is, simply, exactly what tanking is. Punishing and annoying for the first 20 seconds, nothing really interesting after. I really have to disagree with this whole Vengeance model and it clearly hasn't worked out as it should have, namely, making threat scale with everyone's gear while it still matters somewhat.<br />
<br />
That said, the damage some tanks manage to do, especially on AOE, is beyond stupid, to say the least. It's also not something, when I tank, I'm personally interested in. I much rather do a good job tanking and feel satisfied after than having to feel I'm just hammering my keys and popping a CD when DBM yells breath at me - that is, after the panic of the pull.</div></div><hr />

Vengeance never had anything to do with burst aggro. The solution in that case is to tell the dps to hold off for a few seconds. Vengeance was created for long fights at the end of a tier where the dps in BIS were being forced to throttle back dps for long periods of time because the tanks couldn´t keep threat because his BIS stuff was all about avoidance.<br />
<br />
I have a bear and a pro pally, I have no problems with either of them.<br />
<br />
I do think they were onto something regarding DKs. I think average tanks for all specs are fairly equal, but I think bad dks are much worse than bad players of other tank specs.<br />
<br />
THIS! Just tell your damn DPS to wait for 5 seconds. It really doesn't make your kill a wipe to enrage! And if ret or frost DK wants to burst from start, have someone BoSalvation them. And if you happen to miss first few hits and someone dies, accept it as a part of the game. Threat should NOT be guaranteed.<br />

Personally I have gotten a little bored of the legendary always being a weapon I kind of want to see something else thats cool and using the right item slot/lore they could make a legendary that could be used for any role. To me it seems that yes the hunter/druid/rogue &quot;agi group&quot; seems the only group that haven't gotten a legendary yet(aside from the bow which was only hunter). More over I think they are intentionally picking some questions that are less than top-notch so that they give us some idea of what they plan to but still keep us guessing to keep us playing.<br />

As to teaching people to tank. Some sort of in game teaching should should be added. I like the idea of a mandatory type quest chain with maybe a remote controlled robot that has the standard tanking abilities to just show the basics.</div></div><hr />

I don't see how the information we were given warrants that.<br />
<br />
Also, they may just be calling it 4.3 for the time being, meaning the next raid. They could choose to have an Legendary at each new raid level. Legendaries are fun, they're unique content, I can see why they'd like to do more, so long as they keep it special.<br />

<br />
And again.. read every discussion Blizzard ever had about vengeance. Vengeance was added ONLY for raiding... and more precisely for the END of tiers of RAIDING. In heroic 5 mans, and lower dungeons.... if a dps can pull aggro, it is because someone is not playing correctly. Either the tank isn´t marking targets, or the dps is AOEing too early. That is a PLAYER issue. The reason vengeance was introduced is because in previous expansions, at the end of a tier, the DPS had BIS gear, and the tanks BIS gear did not allow them to increase their threat enough to cover the huge increase in damage the dps were now doing. It was not a tank issue, and it was not a dps issue, and it sucked because many dps had to throttle back their damage for long periods of time, making their new BIS gear pretty useless.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem with 1-80 dungeons is heirlooms. It is nearly impossible to tank them because you always have someone doing insane damage.. but it really doesn´t matter since that dps can also tank and kill the mob also. It is sloppy gameplay, but it isn´t that huge of a deal. The problem with heroic 5mans now is that as we outgear them, we also get lazy. I am guilty of this myself. I rarely mark targets any more, so if a geared dps focuses on something that I am only hitting with swipe, yes he is going to pull. But it is not something vengeance should ever be able to fix because it means I will be doing insane amounts of damage (if my off-target aoe can keep threat from a geared dps´s focus fire, that means my overall dps is huge).</div></div><hr />

Newsflash, while you have a shield that always has a chance to block, if i get HIT/Exp cap on my DK, my mastery and dodge/parry will drop to the floor, meaning my bloodshield and my heals will be hilarious and ill be like a wet tissue paper. So I have to sacrifice all hit/exp to gain more survivability as id rather miss 1 BS with 110% mastery than have the same BS hit with 85% mastery. <br />

But yup if you have no problems with stacking hit/mastery and survivability as a war, then i hope just DKs get some hit caps, leave wars like they are, seems they are doing mighty fine.</div></div><hr />

This is all public forums we're talking about, so anybody can do the math and count votes themselves should they wish, and has been done several times by different studies, all of them coming to the same conclusion Blizzard already had, those in fact were the most voted and asked questions.<br />
Since no one can actually see the number of votes a post gets, other than Blizzard, how exactly do you &quot;do the math and count votes&quot;? And these &quot;done several times by different studies, all of them coming to the same conclusion&quot; link or source?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really? Has this guy even seen what feral innervate does now? Probably less than 2% of a healers total mana, and while it can give a healer one more cast, it doesn't compare at all to divine guardian or warrior mobility. <br />
<br />
Why do they even do ask the Devs? He basically said that they are not doing anything that they are asking and they think everything is fine.</div></div><hr />

Wonder what class/classes this is going to be for<br />

I hope so too...especially they spoke of it in a topic called ''Ask The Devs #9 - Tanking''</div></div><hr />

(As one small example, we briefly removed Lay on Hands during Cataclysm development, and there was an outcry even from within the team.)<br />
<br />
So... the game is designed by scrubs... awesome... &gt;.&gt;<br />

Just a theory</div></div><hr />

Narrow....<br />
Narrow Rhymes with Sparrow...<br />
<br />
Sparrow is a Bird...<br />
<br />
Hawk is also a bird...<br />
<br />
Aspect of the hawk?<br />
<br />
Aspect of the hawk is a hunter skill<br />
