Blizzard just posted a recap of the Patch 4.1 features, which is basically a &quot;we won't tell you yet, but patch is on April 26/27th&quot;. <br />
Patch 4.1 will soon be upon us, and it’s high time we dig into the meat of this patch to digest the new content, features, and official patch notes. The rise of the Zandalari (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2223-Patch-4.1-Content-Preview-Rise-of-the-Zandalari) is happening soon on a realm near you, so make sure you’ve read up on the new level-85 Stranglethorn quest line, as well as the updated dungeons of Zul’Gurub and Zul’Aman -- now suitable for five level-85 players with an average item level of 346 or higher. All-new epic gear, rare mounts, pets, and other interesting treasures await you, should you be able to rise to the challenge of the Zandalari!<br />
<br />
If you’ve found yourself waiting in dungeon queues longer than you’d like, we have a new system, Dungeon Finder: Call to Arms (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2243-Patch-4.1-Preview-Dungeon-Finder-Call-to-Arms), you should know about. The Dungeon Finder will be offering an additional incentive to players of underrepresented class roles. With this feature we hope to get you into the action faster.<br />
<br />
We’ve also built a new Guild Finder (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2263-Patch-4.1-Guild-Finder-Blizzard-QA-Jobs-Artworks-Fan-Arts) feature into the game interface and plan to expand upon its functionality in upcoming patches. Whether you’re a player looking for a guild, or a guild leader looking to recruit, this system facilitates those activities. We’re continuing to update, improve, and adjust the Guild Advancement system and want to make sure you’re given the tools to find and maintain a fun guild.<br />
<br />
If you’re already tackling content with your guildmates, you’ll probably be interested in the upcoming Guild Challenges (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2229-Ensidia-is-Awesome-Rogers-throttling-WoW-Guild-Challenges-Preview-Blue-Posts). By completing dungeons, raids, and Rated Battlegrounds in guild groups, you’ll attain new achievements, accrue gold for the Guild Vault, and earn guild experience above the current daily cap. We plan to introduce more Guild Challenges in future updates.<br />
<br />
Now, without further ado, here are the official 4.1 patch notes.<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft Client Patch 4.1<br />
<br />
Notes for all World of Warcraft patches can be found here (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/patch-notes/).<br />
<br />
Rise of the Zandalari<br />
<br />
The days when great troll empires stretched across ancient Kalimdor are long past. Millennia of war and internal strife have stripped these nations of their power, lands, and glory. As Azeroth recovers from the destruction of the Cataclysm, the world's divided troll populations face a bleak future. These dark times have spurred the trolls of the Zandalar, the historically wise and scholarly tribe from which all trolls originated, to take drastic action. They have embarked on a bold crusade to save their race by uniting trolls into a single mighty empire. With the Zandalari's aid, the fallen capitals of the Gurubashi and Amani nations—Zul'Gurub and Zul'Aman—are already rebuilding, replenishing their forces for a bloody campaign to expand their territories.<br />
<br />
Yet Vol'jin and his Darkspear trolls are not aligned with the Zandalari. They have sworn to stand with their Horde comrades—and even work with the Alliance—should the trolls ignite a new war on Azeroth. Soon, Vol'jin might be forced to act on his promise, for if the Gurubashi and Amani are left to their own devices, the world will know the legendary strength and savagery of the ancient troll empires once again.<br />
<br />
Guild Challenges<br />
<br />
Built into the Info panel of the guild user interface, Guild Challenges are weekly tasks guild groups can tackle for additional guild experience, achievements, and gold. At the top of the guild user interface Info pane, a new Guild Challenges section is displayed and broken into three categories: Dungeons, Raids, and Rated Battlegrounds. Any guild group will qualify for Guild Challenges credit and there is a set number of times each challenge can be completed per week.<br />
<br />
Guild Finder<br />
<br />
Guild Finder is a new system designed to enable easier and faster guild recruitment. Guild leaders and players who are looking for a guild to call home will use the Guild Finder to meet one another and begin communications that can lead to a prosperous membership. Whether you're a guild leader looking to fill your ranks or a player looking for a guild that meets your strictest requirements, the Guild Finder provides an easy way to make new friends!<br />
<br />
Dungeon Finder: Call to Arms<br />
<br />
A new system intended to lower queue times, Dungeon Finder: Call to Arms offers additional rewards for queuing as the currently least represented role. To be eligible for the additional rewards you must solo queue for a random level-85 Heroic in the role that is currently being Called to Arms, and complete the dungeon by killing the final boss. Every time you hit these requirements (there is no daily limit) you'll receive a goodie bag that will contain some gold, a chance at a rare gem, a chance at a flask/potion, a good chance of receiving a non-combat pet (including cross faction pets), and a very rare chance at receiving a mount.<br />
<br />
General<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Conquest Points are now purchasable from the Valor Quartermasters at 250 Conquest Points per 250 Valor Points.<br />
Honor Points are now purchasable from the Justice Trade Goods vendors at 250 Honor Points per 375 Justice Points.<br />
Justice Points are now purchasable from the Honor Trade Goods vendors at 250 Justice Points per 375 Honor Points.<br />
Resilience scaling has been modified for linear returns, as opposed to increasing returns. Under the new formula, going from 30 resilience to 40 resilience gives players the same increase to survivability as going from 0 to 10. Resilience now scales in the same way armor and magic resistances do. A player with 32.5% damage reduction from resilience in 4.0.6 should see their damage reduction unchanged in 4.1. Those with less than 32.5% will gain slightly. Those with more will lose some damage reduction, increasingly so as their resilience climbs.<br />
A dead player can now be resurrected by targeting them using the Party or Raid Frame even if they have released. No more hunting for corpses.<br />
<br />
<br />
Achievements<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A new feat of strength with an associated title, &quot;the Camel-Hoarder&quot;, has been added for players that have bested Dormus and obtained the Reins of the Grey Riding Camel -- because there must always be a Camel-Hoarder.<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
<br />
The following Battleground achievements have been permanently removed from the game, as they do not function correctly with the achievement tracking system: Guild Gankin' in Gilneas, Guild Gulch, The Peak of Perfection, The Perfect Guild Storm, Storming the Beach.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rated Battlegrounds<br />
<br />
The achievements to win 100 rated Battlegrounds have been renamed to &quot;Veteran of the Alliance&quot; and &quot;Veteran of the Horde&quot;, and now award those titles.<br />
Achievements to win 300 rated Battlegrounds have been added, awarding the &quot;Warbound&quot; and &quot;Warbringer&quot; titles to the Alliance and Horde respectively.<br />
<br />
<br />
Arathi Basin<br />
<br />
The achievement &quot;We Had It All Along *cough*&quot; now requires the player to win Arathi Basin by 50 points or less, up from 10 points or less.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Battle for Gilneas<br />
<br />
The achievement &quot;Jugger Not&quot; now requires the player to win The Battle for Gilneas by 100 points or less, up from 10 points or less.<br />
The achievement &quot;Out of the Fog&quot; requires the player to defend 2 bases in a single battle, down from 3.<br />
The achievement &quot;One Two Three You Don't Know About Me&quot; requires the player to assault 2 bases in a single battle, down from 3.<br />

The achievement &quot;Battle for Gilneas All-Star&quot; now requires a single flag assault and flag defense in a battle, down from 2.<br />
<br />
<br />
Achievements Bug Fixes<br />
<br />
The guild rated Battleground title achievements should now properly be awarded.<br />
Valor and Conquest Points are displaying the correct values when tracked for achievements.<br />
<br />
<br />
Classes: General<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
All non-damaging interrupts off the global cooldown will now always hit the target. This includes Pummel, Kick, Mind Freeze, Rebuke, Skull Bash, Counterspell, Wind Shear, Solar Beam, Silencing Shot, and related player pet abilities.<br />
Several persistent ground effects now display different visuals for hostile and friendly players. The following spells have the same visual effects for friendly players, but new alternate visuals for hostile players: Ring of Frost, Consecration, Desecration, Wild Mushroom, Flare, Ice Trap, Power Word: Barrier, Smoke Bomb, and Hand of Gul'dan. As a general rule, the alternate effects have a red tint or hue indicating they are created by an enemy player.<br />

<br />
<br />
Unholy<br />
<br />
Desecration no longer triggers when an applicable strike hits a snare-immune target. This is primarily to avoid unnecessary spell effect clutter during boss encounters.<br />

<br />

It creates a healing zone at the feet of a Swiftmend target, but this healing zone now restores health equal to 4/8/12% of the amount healed by Swiftmend to the three most injured targets within 8 yards, every 1 second for 7 seconds. This periodic effect now also benefits from spell haste, but the individual ticks cannot be critical effects. In addition, Living Seed is no longer a prerequisite talent for Efflorescence.<br />

<br />
<br />
Visual Settings Updates<br />

Actually it is very early. 3.1 didn't come until about 6 months after Wrath launched. It has only been 4 months. Anyways, this doesn't mean 4.2 is another 4 months away, we could be getting 4.2 in 3-4 weeks for all we know. Actually, I am pretty sure 4.2 is just around the corner.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rain of Fire damage has been increased by 25%.<br />
Seed of Corruption damage has been increased by 20%.<br />
Haunt damage has been increased by 30%.<br />
Mana Feed now restores more mana (four times as much) when the warlock is using a Felguard or Felhunter.<br />
Doomguard's damage has been increased by 50%.<br />
Shadow Bite (Felhunter) damage and effect has doubled.<br />
<br />
25% 20% 30% 50% 100%<br />
<br />
i mean look at shadow bite it will deal 2x damage. makes you wonder if anything at all in this game is balanced</div></div><hr />

I would actually have to say the game is more balanced then it has ever been. Doesn't mean it is even CLOSE to an actual balance though. I would even say Blizzard has this game balanced more then any other game out there, true balance is impossible to achieve.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thing is, you nerf blood dk healing, they can't tank anymore. It's how blizzard decided to go with the tank aspect. They'd have to rework blood completely around a new mechanic. Sure it's a pvp annoyance right now, but blood dk is struggling for relevance in the heroic raiding scene already.</div></div><hr />

I will not even compare the new raids with the old ones cause they are jokes compared to Karazhan, Black Temple, Sunwell, Ulduar and etc.<br />

Oh please, it's an RPG game, if you don't like to make quests, find keys to open doors and chests, explore caves, temples, and those things, simple, don't play, so maybe the Blizzard could remember that WOW was one day one RPG and then stop doing some no sence things.</div></div><hr />

They never mentioned trading conquest for valor, it can only be done the other way around. It makes sense since you only need 5 rated Arena wins to get capped on Conquest Points.</div></div><hr />

Makes players play a spec they don't want to JUST for the loot, or B. Rewards players for picking a spec they already intended to play as. They wouldn't have the damned shortage if they hadn't gone on their insane revamp of how they 2 roles worked. Its they way of saying &quot;Way we screwed up, but we don't want to fix it because we like it so we are going to bribe the small amount of people that do play those roles rather than make it more interesting for more to pick up those roles instead. *Flips off the community*&quot;</div></div><hr />

I am assuming this is to make up for the worthless glyph felhunter has. Succy Imp, and FG's glyphs all make them substantially more viable. Felhunter has been a &quot;meh&quot; PvP pet at best. Hopefully, this will make felhunter viable for affliction again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agree. For the people pointing out the great number of changes, don't forget it's a major patch... The kind of patch we're supposed to have three or four times only per expansion. And considering this, the content of this update is totally disappointing, specially the absence of new raid. And the revamped 5 man ZG is far from enough to compensate for that.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, this has to be the most boring patch ever for me. Granted the colossus smash change is good, it still feels really..uninspired and boring.

<br />
Moonkin is getting nerfed for PvE where we are not the best single target damage already, and for PvP where we already suck ass. Ret pala is getting a major PvP nerf and warriors and DK are already out healing me by quite a large margin. A change that will also be felt when Prot tanking. Seems classes that are already doing well are being buffed, while classes that perform under par are getting nerfed...<br />
<br />
This patch contains a bunch of worthless fluff and a bunch of idiotic class changes.. But hey we get more paid services and rehashed old content that most already outgear..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Felaful</div><div class="date">2011-04-23, 07:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thing is, you nerf blood dk healing, they can't tank anymore. It's how blizzard decided to go with the tank aspect. They'd have to rework blood completely around a new mechanic. Sure it's a pvp annoyance right now, but blood dk is struggling for relevance in the heroic raiding scene already.<br />
<br />
I completely disagree with this. If they nerf blood dk healing, they will be able to tank, they just wont be able to solo current cataclysm heroic content anymore, which is ridiculous. I see a ton of videos of dks soling current content easily. Raegwyn is a great DK, there's no doubt about that, but all you see is videos of blood dks (not just Raeg) soloing current heroic content, not just one, but two bosses, as well as ICC raid content, that's kind of ridiculous, and it would lead me to believe that DK self helaing is perfectly fine, in fact, better than fine, and could certainly use a tune down.<br />
<br />
People complained when paladins were able to do all this, and to solve the problem, blizzard takes the abilities from them, and hands them all to the DK! Hell, this new glyph is gonna cut death gate down to a 4 second cast! If the DK can absorb damage for 4 seconds, he has something equivalent to the old pally bubble hearth!<br />
<br />
I honestly shouldn't make a huge deal of this, however, as it's kind of been proven that blizzard has favored mages and DKs so far. They even admitted in one of their previous blue posts. Before, they were playing other classes and that's how they tested the new content. Because they tested using the classes they played, they tuned them up to benefit their specific classes. Now, they are testing the new content with their dks and mages, so therefore, they are tuning up the content to benefit their dks and mages. But as people have said many times over: There seems to be a lack of thinking involved with a lot of these nerfs and these buffs. I'm glad the paladins got their nerfs, but handing them all over to the DKs was the dumbest mistake ever. DKs can literally out-heal paladins now, and paladins are the light-wielding heal-while-i-dps class.<br />
<br />
If the lore states that scourge can never be paladins/priests because they cannot wield the light, then how the hell are they out-healing them? Yes, DKs are SCOURGE.</div></div><hr />

They have to Bribe and lure people to play Tank and Heals because no one in their right mind wants too. Its more of a &quot;Do this and you get extra&quot; which A. Makes players play a spec they don't want to JUST for the loot, or B. Rewards players for picking a spec they already intended to play as. They wouldn't have the damned shortage if they hadn't gone on their insane revamp of how they 2 roles worked. Its they way of saying &quot;Way we screwed up, but we don't want to fix it because we like it so we are going to bribe the small amount of people that do play those roles rather than make it more interesting for more to pick up those roles instead. *Flips off the community*&quot;<br />
<br />
Because tanks and healers ALWAYS outnumbered DPS classes until this expansion, right? -_-<br />
<br />
Just face it, most people enjoy the low responsibility of playing a pew pew DPS over keeping people alive or getting hit in the face. The problem lies within the roles themselves, not the way that blizzard designed them. I've been a tank since Vanilla, and I have never enjoyed it more than I do now. Most people would rather quit the game than play a tanking class. It's not for everyone. DPS is more accessible because, typically, you don't have as much responsibility compared to a tank or healer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rain of Fire damage has been increased by 25%.<br />
Seed of Corruption damage has been increased by 20%.<br />
Haunt damage has been increased by 30%.<br />
Mana Feed now restores more mana (four times as much) when the warlock is using a Felguard or Felhunter.<br />
Doomguard's damage has been increased by 50%.<br />
Shadow Bite (Felhunter) damage and effect has doubled.<br />
<br />
25% 20% 30% 50% 100%<br />

i mean look at shadow bite it will deal 2x damage. makes you wonder if anything at all in this game is balanced<br />

Pvp wise: Afl damage hasn't been changed much! The nerve to Dark intent is 6%. Whilst the boost is only 5% overall.<br />
Haunt did like 4k damage... WOOOW now it almost does 5K, very OP not? Then the soul swap nerve omfg... 10 to 15 sec cd :s, tough before qqing I got to test it out.<br />

Are you reading the same notes as the rest of us?<br />
Affi dmg in pvp will be alot better due to this buff:<br />
Unstable Affliction damage done when it is dispelled has been doubled, but this damage can no longer be critical.<br />
It will make dispellers less eager to press that dispel button.<br />
<br />
And DI will remain unchanged for you. It's the target you put it on who gets a dmg nerf.</div></div><hr />

Not once did I reference what the crazy soloers out there do. I meant actual tanking, I.E. raiding. You seem to have a paladin bias, which is fine, but you shouldn't put blinders on to the fact I was saying the blood dk heals are what THE WHOLE SPEC IS CENTERED AROUND. (sorry cant bold that, didnt mean to yell). Nerfing their heals is nerfing their ability to do what they were intended to do, which is tank. Blizzard is already putting in countermeasures to what you described, the heroics soloing and whatnot. Unless DK gets a shield, or a crazy high base avoidance the heals have to stay to make them viable in raids. There's no DK favoritism at all going on, I have no idea what fantasy world you're living in. DK was (5th?) in dps charts yet it got quite a few nerfs, and what'd we get in return? Battle-rez. weee.<br />

I am a veteran player who still plays WoW Vanilla (patch 1.12) on a private server. Frankly, there is nothing in this patch that would entice me to retrun to WoW retail. To be more precise:<br />
<br />
1. In the original World of Warcraft, 20 man raid bosses in Zul Gurub (ZG) and Ruins of Ahn Qiraj (AQ 20) dropped blue quality loot in addition to some few and far between epic pieces. In current WoW, 5 man bosses drop epics. Five man dungeon bosses in the original WoW (Strat, Scholo DM) dropped blue loot. End bosses in Strat and Scholo could drop a single epic piece with a 1% drop rate.<br />
<br />
I think that WoW CATA is giving away epics for free again, a la WOTLK. I thought that Blizzard had dumped the WOTLK `free epics from 5 mans` paradigm. Apparently they did not.<br />
<br />
I don`t want to play a game where epics are devalued and are handed out for free to terribad players whom invest minimal effort.<br />
<br />
2. My favourite class, Hunters, are once again dead last in Arena representation.<br />
<br />
Though I dislike Arena, Arena statistics is a good indication of class potency in PvP. I have been away from WoW retail since Feb 2010, and I see that nothing has changed.<br />
<br />
---------------&gt;Paladins are still OP and still have a solid Arena representation in all brackets.<br />
---------------&gt;Frost Mages are still after 6 years dominant in PvP.<br />
---------------&gt;Rogues are the second least played class in the game.<br />
---------------&gt;Shamans are still a joke in PvP and the least played class in the game.<br />
---------------&gt;Death Knights continue to be a one-man-army with a solid Arena representation.<br />
<br />
Hunters have become a fun class but not really suited to PvP, which is reserved for Paladins, DK`s, Warriors, Frost Mages and ofc Priests. So, what has changed since 2010? Nothing. WoW continues to be World of Platecraft/Paladincraft.<br />
<br />
--------------------------&gt;in view of the above, I will continue to raid ZG, AQ 20, Molten Core, and BWL with my Hunter toon in 1.12 WoW, and I will continue to PvP with my Hunter in 1.12.<br />
<br />
I really don`t want to play in a game where epics are handed out for free in 5 man dungeons, and Paladins/DKs reign supreme in PvP.<br />

Here you go:<br />
<br />
<br />
The Chilled proc from Frost Armor can no longer proc Fingers of Frost.<br />
Nerf for Frost mages trained by melee.<br />
<br />
<br />
The attack speed slow from the Chilled proc is now 20%, down from 25%.<br />
Again, nerf against melee.<br />
<br />
<br />
Frost Armor also no longer increases Frost resistance.<br />
Nerf.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fire<br />
Ignite is no longer triggered from periodic critical effects.<br />
Nerf for PvE Fire mages. It was intended to combat ignite munching but actually results in a dps loss.<br />
<br />
<br />
Frost<br />
The root effect from Shattered Barrier now shares diminishing returns with the root from Improved Cone of Cold.<br />
Another PvP nerf for frost.<br />
<br />

How can you say that CATA is giving away EPICS, your un intelligent post shows what a NUB you are, just because your a pure vanilla player doesn't make you leet..you have to continue to experience all content changes to have an idea of what WOW is...<br />
Clearly you have been on a private server too long..why don't you step into the current Wow and you would see that 5 man bosses don't drop epics, regular mode they drop blues and heroic they drop Heroic Bluies...So you are wrong...They have made epics more rewarding to get, just like Vanilla. Now the current patch on the way introduces ZG and ZA back but as a 5 player dungeons and yes these two and only these two drop ILVL 353 from bosses..not 359 like in RAIDS..Since this is not implemented on LIVE servers its still the norm for all dungeon bosses and trash mobs to drop blues.<br />
<br />
If your going to post on WOW forums you should really be up to date with WOW, you know to keep up with the rest of us...otherwise you just come across as a douche...IMO</div></div><hr />

<br />
When Shaman's Spirit Link was announced, Blizzard mentioned that it was because they didn't have any big defensive cooldown, and that it was a problem they were looking to fix for 4.1 as regards druids too. Shortly afterwards, Tranquility got a cooldown reduction from 8 to 3 minutes. There were a lot of people saying &quot;well, this clearly isn't it, as the healing will be nerfed&quot; - but that nerf still hasn't come. In fact,we've now been given pushback protection while channeling it. <br />
<br />
If it stays like this (at full strength), then Resto's throughput will go through the roof - but we'll be the healer without any mitigation. So we'll lose whatever shot at tank healing we had (which will largely kill our Mastery) but be the pretty much the number one choice for raid healing. Particularly on 10-man - between this and the new Effloresce, we can bring up 8/10 raid members from scratch. Not to mention that without needing to talent into Living Seed, we'll have three more points to improve our healing elsewhere.<br />
<br />
The lack of mitigation shouldn't mean much in normal raids - if your Tank is going to die in two hits, your tank's not geared for the raid. Heroics will be more tricky though. I'd imagine that we'll get a fairly good spot - most 10-mans will take a druid, and every 25-man will take one - but only one. I can live with that :)<br />
<br />

Agains frost mages you've got either the slow or freeze effects on you either from the Frost Armor or from another sources nearly 95% of time, if you get lucky and have a healer behind your ass who doesn't do anything but dispells, otherwise it's 100% of the time. If the mage is skilled, a melee won't reach you now as well as before the patch.<br />
And don't worry, I understand mages - that was the first class I played :)</div></div><hr />

Hahahaha xD What a LOL.<br />
1. RoF and SoC was rly bad aoe spell. Blizz buffed them, so they can be equal(more or less) to the other aoe spells.<br />
2. Haunt has 8sec cd and it doesn't rly hit for some huge amount of dmg, so this buff is rly rly small (in matter of overall dmg and dps as affli wlock).<br />
3. 50% because Doomguard was USELESS. This was a singletarget guardian which was WORSE than AoE aura from Infernal. I would LOL if then weren't fixed that.<br />
4. Another issue with pets. Every specc should use other pet(that is what blizzard was intending to do), but now they fu*ked it up, and you were using Succubus in affli and demo. The most funny thing is, that in demo you got &quot;special spell&quot; called Felguard, and you actually do not use it, cuz it is worse than some &quot;normal&quot; pet which can be summoned in every specc :D But now you see, felhunter is now playable pet for affliction. That's good. That's what should be done at the beggining of cata...</div></div><hr />

I can see you havent played for a while, paladins are currently one of the worst pvp classes (at high level arena, not 1400 rating) and they are only getting nerfs this patch. Restoration shamans are one of the best healers and will do better than a holy paladin in any possible comp.<br />

<br />
1. In the original World of Warcraft, 20 man raid bosses in Zul Gurub (ZG) and Ruins of Ahn Qiraj (AQ 20) dropped blue quality loot in addition to some few and far between epic pieces. In current WoW, 5 man bosses drop epics. Five man dungeon bosses in the original WoW (Strat, Scholo DM) dropped blue loot. End bosses in Strat and Scholo could drop a single epic piece with a 1% drop rate.<br />
<br />
I think that WoW CATA is giving away epics for free again, a la WOTLK. I thought that Blizzard had dumped the WOTLK `free epics from 5 mans` paradigm. Apparently they did not.<br />
<br />
I don`t want to play a game where epics are devalued and are handed out for free to terribad players whom invest minimal effort.<br />
<br />
2. My favourite class, Hunters, are once again dead last in Arena representation.<br />
<br />

<br />
---------------&gt;Paladins are still OP and still have a solid Arena representation in all brackets.<br />
---------------&gt;Frost Mages are still after 6 years dominant in PvP.<br />
---------------&gt;Rogues are the second least played class in the game.<br />
---------------&gt;Shamans are still a joke in PvP and the least played class in the game.<br />
---------------&gt;Death Knights continue to be a one-man-army with a solid Arena representation.<br />
<br />
Hunters have become a fun class but not really suited to PvP, which is reserved for Paladins, DK`s, Warriors, Frost Mages and ofc Priests. So, what has changed since 2010? Nothing. WoW continues to be World of Platecraft/Paladincraft.<br />
<br />

Happens time and again to locks and I'm not coming back from Rift to play my lock for that, seen it too many times. They did the exact same thing with the cata release, we got our buffs nerfed after a month.<br />

<br />
Just face it, most people enjoy the low responsibility of playing a pew pew DPS over keeping people alive or getting hit in the face. The problem lies within the roles themselves, not the way that blizzard designed them. I've been a tank since Vanilla, and I have never enjoyed it more than I do now. Most people would rather quit the game than play a tanking class. It's not for everyone. DPS is more accessible because, typically, you don't have as much responsibility compared to a tank or healer.<br />
<br />
Personally I like healing and have been healing as a resto shaman and resto druid since TBC and a holy priest since wotlk. I enjoyed healing most in TBC before we had the super buffed up wack-a-mole game that was wotlk, which I found I could have fun at even if I didn't like it as much. Having said that, I have had a really hard time getting into healing this expansion and nerfing healing is not helping. The fact that I like casual PvP, which hasn't been much fun since TBC, also does not help. The odd thing is I can't explain why healing is not fun anymore.</div></div><hr />

Some of those numbers are long overdue adjustments.<br />
The most notable being the doomguard change because by design the doomguard was meant to be the single target dps cooldown, while the infernal was meant for multi-target or AoE.<br />
That however was not what worked in practice due to the infernal substantially outdamaging the doomguard even on single target.<br />
The AoE damage was quite substantially skewed in the benefit of demonology so a buff to bring the other specs nearer in line with that is understandable.</div></div><hr />

They wouldn't have the damned shortage if they hadn't gone on their insane revamp of how they 2 roles worked. Its they way of saying &quot;Way we screwed up, but we don't want to fix it because we like it so we are going to bribe the small amount of people that do play those roles rather than make it more interesting for more to pick up those roles instead. *Flips off the community*&quot;<br />
<br />
It's not that nobody wants to tank or heal...they just don't want to tank or heal for you (you being random LFD stranger). We all still tank for our friends. And 'insane revamp' to tanking?

DPS is more accessible because, typically, you don't have as much responsibility compared to a tank or healer.<br />
<br />
Derp. And that is all your post is just a lot of BULL****. I have been healing since Vanilla I KNOW how the game worked Mkaay. I have SEEN shortages and I KNOW that in Wrath there were MORE yes there was still a shortage but there was still more out there and If you can reply to this post saying there wasn't then you are either lying or ignorant. 11minute que time as a dps jumped up to anywhere from 30 to an hour says A LOT. If you enjoy it YIPPY for you, blizzard shouldn't give you extra rewards for LIKING the role and wanting you to play what you claim to enjoy. Also FYI I had 3 different type of healers and a Tank from Vanilla through to Wrath ... Cata hit and I deleted them.</div></div><hr />

There was no queue time in vanilla and tbc and by the time it was implemented in wrath we were outgearing heroics by a mile. The queue times are the reason for the perceived shortage. In reality there is no shortage. There are actually too many tanks out there to give all tanks wanting to raid a spot because of the tank to dd to healer ratios in raids. On my dd toons I wait 20-30 min for an lfd queue. BFD. Took much longer to pull together trade groups before LFD implementation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How long will it be before raiders get something new to play with? Seven months? Eight? At this rate, 4.2 will be the only raid-content patch released for ALL OF 2011. The 3.3 patch introduced raid content and Blizzard left that up for ALMOST A YEAR before they gave us anything.<br />
<br />
I understand that there is a lot of class changes in there as well as UI and interface additions. The new 5 mans and the super-nerf to heroics will bring a lot of older content to some people who haven't seen it yet. But people who primarily enjoy raiding are going to wait at least 2 months for something new (If 4.2 is truly the massive raid experience we are hoping for, and if Blizzard takes its time debugging and play-testing like it should.) For me, 4.1 being released is just a reminder that the 4.2 test realm isn't even up yet.</div></div><hr />

If they nerf blood dk healing, they will be able to tank, they just wont be able to solo current cataclysm heroic content anymore, which is ridiculous. I see a ton of videos of dks soling current content easily. Raegwyn is a great DK, there's no doubt about that, but all you see is videos of blood dks (not just Raeg) soloing current heroic content, not just one, but two bosses, as well as ICC raid content, that's kind of ridiculous, and it would lead me to believe that DK self helaing is perfectly fine, in fact, better than fine, and could certainly use a tune down.<br />
<br />
People complained when paladins were able to do all this, and to solve the problem, blizzard takes the abilities from them, and hands them all to the DK! Hell, this new glyph is gonna cut death gate down to a 4 second cast! If the DK can absorb damage for 4 seconds, he has something equivalent to the old pally bubble hearth!<br />
<br />
You don't understand fully what Raegwyn and the others do, don't you? It's simply due to Glyph of Dark Succor, which allows Death Strike to heal for a default 15% while in Unholy or Frost. If you notice, there almost always in Unholy, and have a bunch of flasks, self-buffs, potions, and food-buffs to help. I do beleive also BLood Runes are purley used for Rune Tap, which is a 45 second CD I think. Come 4.1, Blood Shield can only work in Blood Presence, which cuts that out completely, for both the PvP and soloing of PvE &quot;problems&quot;.<br />

3 more seconds...decent change but most of the time it's used up quicker anyways.<br />

Dispel Magic can only be used on the casting priest as a baseline effect.<br />
<br />
I take it this means you can only cast Dispel Magic on yourself? If so then this sucks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Priests now innately have 100% pushback protection from damage while channeling Divine Hymn and Hymn of Hope. <br />
<br />
<br />
Much needed change, almost unfair when we pop a 8min CD to have it interrupted 1 sec after casting.<br />
<br />
<br />
Holy Fire damage has been increased to be approximately 30% higher than Smite. <br />
Basically Blizz just trying to get us to do more than Smite spam.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mind Sear damage has been doubled. <br />
Lol, about time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Power Word: Shield duration has been reduced to 15 seconds, down from 30. <br />
<br />
Woah. Not gonna lie I didn't see this one coming. Not sure Blizzs intention for this but this will be a huge killer for PVP. For PVE this change won't be as huge, considering most shields get popped before 15 seconds anyways. Goodbye to pre-shielding, well not like any disc priests have the mana regen for that anyways in Cata.<br />
<br />
<br />
Power Word: Barrier's cooldown has been increased to 3 minutes, up from 2, and its effect has been reduced to 25%, down from 30%. <br />
<br />
Hmm, I guess Blizz hates Priest's absorbing capabilities now.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is now possible to remove Weakened Soul effects that were a result of another priest's Power Word: Shield through Strength of Soul. This is pretty decent, no more troubles with stacking disc priests in a raid. Well, after 4.1 idk why anyone would want even 1 disc priest anyways. <br />
<br />
<br />
Not sure where Blizz is going with Disc priests, they started as tank healers in early wrath and mostly PVP. Then the idea of &quot;Mass shielding&quot; came into play into later WOTLK and skyrocketed. Sure it might have been a little OP but I LOVED shielding the entire raid. This was one of the most important specs/play types to have in ICC. To me it felt as if Blizz was happy with this whole shielding idea for Disc. I guess I was wrong when they insanely increased PWS mana cost in Cata and now with these changes it seems they are trying to move away from shielding. Right now it seems as Disc is a broken spec, we have to spam a damaging spell on an enemy to heal the raid? We try to shield and cast 5 shields and half of our mana is gone. Yeah I do admit in WOTLK it was a bit OP with the mana regen but right now it's just stupid.<br />
<br />
It seems Holy will be taking the crown in Cata, for at least a little while. Oh how much I miss the days of getting 25 shields out on the raid.</div></div><hr />

Really quite amazing this &quot;basic&quot; x.1 patch takes 6 months to make it out, and for what? I will give them that the two new heroics, while recycled content, still take a fair bit of work; but the rest is underwhelming. Class and ability fixes shouldn't take 6 months, nor should adding a new vendor or a handful of dailies; wasting time and effort on trivial features like the guild finder (hello voice chat 2.0, too little way too late) makes me wonder if they've got their head screwed on correctly.<br />

Lol right kid.<br />
<br />
Fact is it was mentioned to be shipping with the game, then it was bumped to &quot;shortly after launch&quot;. A half a year plus isn't &quot;shortly after launch&quot;. FACT is once again it was being worked on for a long time so it should have been able to be released sooner, content is beat, and numbers of player activity has plummeted. I say I have more to stand on then you in my argument.<br />
<br />
Soon enough though you guys will be very happy, it'll just be the sheeple left in the game as people who are not romantically enthralled blindly to a faceless company will leave, and that way blizzard can knock you guys around and you can say &quot;thank you sir, may I have another&quot; and &quot;omg, only 3 classes left in the game?!

FACT is once again it was being worked on for a long time so it should have been able to be released sooner, content is beat, and numbers of player activity has plummeted. I say I have more to stand on then you in my argument.<br />
<br />
Soon enough though you guys will be very happy, it'll just be the sheeple left in the game as people who are not romantically enthralled blindly to a faceless company will leave, and that way blizzard can knock you guys around and you can say &quot;thank you sir, may I have another&quot; and &quot;omg, only 3 classes left in the game?! That's AMAZING!&quot;. LOL.<br />
<br />
Where's the source about Firelands supposed to be shipping with the game? Again, I do not think that Blizzard would ever release two tiers of raids right at the start of the game. This tier was already brutal enough for most top end guilds.<br />
<br />
You're just spewing out all of the same old crap that people have been saying for six years. You say you have &quot;more to stand on,&quot; yet you have nothing but a hunch to back up your claims that &quot;the game is dying.&quot; Like I said to your first post, I wish I had a dollar for every time that someone said &quot;the number of players has plummeted&quot; because people have said that after the launch of each expansion. In reality, the game is fine. Yea, people have quit, but it's nothing more than usual. I remember people saying the same thing as you once WotLK came out because the game &quot;was too easy.&quot; Haters gonna hate.</div></div><hr />

Given how long 4.1 is taking, it'll be amazing if we see 4.2's new raid before October or even November.<br />
<br />
<br />
ICC was out for a year,does it honestly suprise you that blizz could possibly drag out the current content until october or november.it wouldnt suprise me,but things like that are the reason why world of warcrafts community is so bitter sometimes.eather way,im looking forward to the druid tank buffs,i recently made a druid alt again and i forgot how terribly easy(at least at lower lvl,ive never gotten a druid past 67)druid tanking was<br />
<br />
eather way though.i hope the patch eather,makes the game a hell of alot more fun then lately or it makes more people actually log in and play the game since WoW is pretty boring at the moment imo</div></div><hr />

No you still can't send cross realm</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly. You are concerned with a steady stream of easily attainable epics, as you indicated. Im not even putting you down for that. Play the game the way you want, by all means. I believe, however, that I was very clear in my post that I WAS speaking for myself. I said that there is stuff in here for some people, especially those who only do 5 mans and will benefit from the nerf to heroics, as well as the old raid instances being made into 5 mans. For someone like myself who primarily enjoys raiding there is nothing here for me, and 7-8 months waiting for something new is something I though Blizzard said before Cataclysm was released that they wanted to avoid.</div></div><hr />

•Efflorescence has been redesigned. It creates a healing zone at the feet of a Swiftmend target, but this healing zone now restores health equal to 4/8/12% of the amount healed by Swiftmend to the three most injured targets within 8 yards, every 1 second for 7 seconds. This periodic effect now also benefits from spell haste, but the individual ticks cannot be critical effects. In addition, Living Seed is no longer a prerequisite talent for Efflorescence.<br />
•Malfurion's Gift now reduces the cooldown of Tranquility by 2.5/5 minutes.<br />
•Nature's Swiftness now also increases the healing done by the affected nature spell by 50%.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dupcengier25</div><div class="date">2011-04-26, 07:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Many players are confused as to why the Zandalari are now attempting to resurrect the blood god Hakkar, due to the tribe originally aspiring to prevent the event from unfolding prior to the cataclysm. However, perhaps the earth-shattering events have changed their outlook on Azeroth.<br />
<br />
Whatever the case may be, patch 4.1 is no doubt a precursor to future lore events involving the tribe, as well as its homeland of Zandalar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How did you know it was Hakkar? Trolls and serpents have more then once been together - in ZulDrak alone there are two more serpets, which are not hakkar. <br />
<br />
Those creatures merely represent their LoA of death.<br />
<br />
I hope to see the other three Zul instances to be revamped as well :) - and eventually a raid to Zandalar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I find that very unlikely. The Zandalari tribe has been against Hakkar since the very beginning. They have done two attempts of taking him down, the last one being during &quot;Vanilla WoW&quot; where they took help from the Alliance and Horde. <br />
<br />
From what has been known about this tribe, using Hakkar to reach the goal of restoring the Troll empire is kind of unexpected. However, as mentioned by the trailer, the Trolls of Zul'Drak in Northrend did in fact consume the powers of their own gods to help themselves. I suspect that the Zandalari is going to do something similar to Hakkar and use the powers he possesses for their goals. They were in Zul'Drak, too, to record the events that happened there, so it is not that far of a stretch, as I see it.</div></div><hr />
