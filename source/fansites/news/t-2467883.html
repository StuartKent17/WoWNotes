I think they did say the bee mount was alliance side. I remember mentioning it when people complained about the alliance rep mounts all being horses. It seemed like the horde has the cooler ground mount but alliance have some pretty cool flying mounts rewards coming up when they let us fly in BFA content.</div></div><hr />

1. to make sure it works as a BG (Such as you cant escape the area)<br />
2. that it works, cause i mean it hasnt been in the spotlight for a good 11 years...<br />

I'm not allowed to post links, but there are plenty of examples already of the automated ban system booting people offline due to either troll or spam reporting to gain an advantage. All you have to do is a quick google search. In one such example, one player typed &quot;f**k&quot; in guild chat and his guildies jokingly reported him. He was kicked offline with a suspension within seconds of the reports happening. Now, do you believe that a GM somehow reviewed a case and enacted a punishment both within the span of a minute, as in this case? Or would an automatic system with a report quota to trigger make more sense?</div></div><hr />

Post 5 more times then post the link. Cause saying &quot;fuck&quot; won't get you suspended, that will get you silenced. Idk if you know but saying fuck is not bannable it is silence able though. <br />

Apparently though when you are silenced you get dced but can log right back in.<br />

<br />
I mean, there actually is depending on what context you’re talking about. Maybe it’s changed to less, but there used to be a 3 strike and you’re banned if you’d open the game with a bot programme running. i.e. if you opened the game 3 times with a detectable bot running your account would get automatically banned. It’s probably less chances now, but technically there is such a thing as automatic bans.<br />

<br />
Believe me I know as I work in IT and development. That said I think they have or had more than enough resources (monetary, time, developers) to get it done. The issue has always been astonishingly poor choices in direction and content. Blizzard is constantly (at least lately) giving us what they seemingly want and not allowing players to choose to play how they enjoy playing. <br />
<br />
That is on top of not listening to feedback or responding painfully late. Even when it comes from people highly respected in the community. The latest changes at Blizzard do not bode well for any change in that respect. I hope I am wrong as I have played this game without breaks in subscription since Vanilla. Obviously I love the game. I and others just want it to be the best it can be.</div></div><hr />
