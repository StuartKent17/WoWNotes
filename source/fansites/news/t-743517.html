Eviscerate<br />
We are changing Improved Eviscerate to also affect Envenom, to give Assassination another attractive first tier talent for the endgame player. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262768257/break-the-dev-silence-rogue-issues/))<br />
<br />
Recuperate<br />
Endgame rogues will not be balanced around 100% uptime for Recuperate. We do think rogues will use it however. If mana matters a little more, then keeping yourself alive a little more will matter. We're not fans of the (sadly widespread) belief that keeping the group alive is solely the responsibility of the healers and that dps should do everything in their power solely to maximize their dps, even if that makes things harder on the healers. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262768257/break-the-dev-silence-rogue-issues/))<br />

TBH, 277 gear is fine. you can get 277 gear without killing LK HC so, i dont see that as a problem. They just shouldnt use the 284 weapons.<br />

<br />
<br />
well, first off, you're making a pretty big assumption that full 277 (and I'm not quite sure what you define as full 277 - trinkets etc) is exactly equal to the 5% buff and that the kill wasn't also accomplished due to refined gameplay as well.<br />
<br />
Second, all the 5% buff did was reverse the natural progression of final raid boss encounters by allowing skilled players (not me) the chance to down the boss before being 100% geared for it. In the old days it would have taken almost this long for them to get everyone geared up enough.<br />
<br />
It also shows to me that these guys are dedicated enough and true enough fans of the game to want to do it without the buff and take pride in their game. Why haven't the other big guilds with similar gear accomplished this? Not getting paid enough?<br />
<br />
oh and btw why not just be polite and congratulate them on accomplishing something you never will.</div></div><hr />

ICC is a faceroll. The only hard boss in there is Lich King. And that's because of the gear needed, not because the tactics are so insanely hard.<br />

<br />
That doesn't explain why Paragon dominates, thousands of other guilds got the same gear they have (with the exception of lk hc weps) but they can't pull off lk hc with even 30% buff, and the top ~100 guilds couldn't do it with 5% when Paragon did it.<br />
<br />
Don't run around saying that LK requires top gear, that clearly ain't the case since Paragon was the only guild to kill him with 5%, with mostly 264 gear. And now the first to kill him with 0%.. Just luck?<br />
<br />
I can't comment about how difficult LK is though, since I haven't done a single 25hc boss in icc, I quit raiding the week &quot;blood&quot; wing came.<br />
<br />
&lt;/rant&gt;<br />
<br />
Gratz Paragon, well deserved. I reckon many guilds doesn't even bother trying without buff, this truly shows your dedication!</div></div><hr />

<br />
They did it 24 man. thats like 10k-18k less dps, they probably have 4 Shadowmournes on their top melee 2her dpsers (which most good guilds should have by now anyways, my guild has 5 right now). Most of their healers might still use Val. Either way, those 284 weapons even with ilvl 284 trinkets/rings from Halion, aint adding up to a 10k dps loss, then without buff..<br />
<br />
Paragon did it for an accomplishment, but what sucks is that no matter what they do, people won't be pleased or will have something bad to say.<br />

I think they might have to do it in 264's no heroic gear no shadowmournes for people to be happy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love the people slamming Paragon and saying it isn't legit because of their gear. Name me one guild - one single guild, absolutely god damn any guild - that hasn't killed LK25HC yet, and is therefor now farming 284 weapons, and is even remotely capable of killing him without the buff. I do not believe there are any guilds like that in this game. Any guild capable of potentially killing him without the buff already killed him with the buff a long, long time ago and is now rolling in 284 weapons. They may have even DE'd a couple 284 weapons.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gilian</div><div class="date">2010-07-29, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, first off, you're making a pretty big assumption that full 277 (and I'm not quite sure what you define as full 277 - trinkets etc) is exactly equal to the 5% buff and that the kill wasn't also accomplished due to refined gameplay as well.<br />
<br />
Second, all the 5% buff did was reverse the natural progression of final raid boss encounters by allowing skilled players (not me) the chance to down the boss before being 100% geared for it. In the old days it would have taken almost this long for them to get everyone geared up enough.<br />
<br />
It also shows to me that these guys are dedicated enough and true enough fans of the game to want to do it without the buff and take pride in their game. Why haven't the other big guilds with similar gear accomplished this? Not getting paid enough?<br />
<br />
oh and btw why not just be polite and congratulate them on accomplishing something you never will.<br />
<br />
At least you are polite. You make a good example.<br />
<br />
First of all I don't think they changed tactics or anything. Second they killed him many times already (lots of time to practice and do it perfectly). Third they are all in the best gear possible. Do you really think that doesn't make up for that 5% buff? They just waited untill now, why didn't they kill him sooner without buff?<br />
But yes, they are very, very dedicated and congratulations to them.<br />
<br />
And why other guilds didn't do it? I guess because it's pointless. It doesn't really show that you are better than some other guild. It's not THAT big of a deal.</div></div><hr />

Quoted for truth! If they remove the aspect where players have to focus 100% on DPS and start focusing on survivability, they will not be able to make encounters hard enough or fool proof enough where players will HAVE to focus on reducing an intake of damage, thus cutting out the top end game dps required, which in turn means they won't be able to make fights unbelievably hard like Heroic LK.<br />
<br />
DPS avoid instagibs and major damage intake which can/will get them killed in seconds. In a fight like LK, there is no need for DPS to be anything but balls-to-the-wall DPS doing everything from Saronite bombs, etc. to kill it. If it can be done without the survivability factor, then why choose it? Why make a healers job easier when in the end you get a result the same way (but faster). Mana efficiency is one thing, but unless they are guarenteed to run out of mana if you do not choose (XX) talent, then theres no point.</div></div><hr />

That does not make any sense. If you are tunneling the boss and doing 17k DPS, but sucks up healer mana by being stupid and not paying attention to survivability, than you are a worse player than the player who saves a healer enough mana to not have to worry about them by being intelligent and does 16k DPS. That is what Cataclysm is supposed to be like.<br />
<br />
In Cataclysm, you will be able to wipe the group by being a damn heal sponge and making your healers go OOM. A good player will learn how to maximize DPS WHILE MINIMIZING damage taken. Damage avoided is healer strain relieved, and in Cataclysm, healer strain relieved will reduce the chance for a wipe.</div></div><hr />

Actualy, you kind of got it wrong, i agree the Lich King is pretty much one of the only boss really hard in Heroic ICC (Sindy and Putricide were a pain at the begining at 0-5% buff too, but now, meh.) But the main thing with the Lich King is that, no matter how geared you are, no matter the % of the ICC buff, if you have ONE guy that fucks up or react a second too late, its a wipe. He's not about gear (tough you kind of need it cause he got so much health but meh). But its a boss that depends a lot on the number of individual mistake, and not really on HPS or to a certain point DPS. Thats why the boss is so hard.</div></div><hr />

You came out of a cave or something? Most guilds got the whole place down except for Lich King heroic the first week if not the seconds week ICC heroic opened. So everything was done with 0% and Lich King heroic with 5% buff or &quot;nerf&quot;.</div></div><hr />

It's not level 800 ETC in the WoW universe. It's L800ETC in the Starcraft 2 universe.... AKA 2500 A.D. or so.<br />
<br />
So in 486 years or so, we will be level 800.<br />

The reference is a commercial in the news broadcasts during the campaign, for their new album.<br />

<br />
That's like saying no one has killed 10,000 boars in 48 hours. It's a pointless &quot;achievement&quot; that really doesn't do anything to solidify their skills. We know they are one of the best but this doesn't boost them at all. Finishing a fight this late into the release of the dungeon just pretty much proves no one else even bothered. You don't get any new lore, and you had months to farm out the instance whereas pretty much every other world first this expansion did not include time to grind the crap out the best gear prior to said boss.<br />

No they wouldn't. The game is boring now and most dedicated players are playing something else or not taking the game seriously. LK has been long dead and nothing new has been proven. Paragon was just the only guild dumb enough to think they are proving something. They can't let go of this game because it's the only thing giving them a reason to live LOL<br />

I mean seriously who near Paragon's level (there are several guilds worldwide who can compete at their level) has even come close to giving a crap about Wrath progression this close to Cata.</div></div><hr />

I understand what you are saying. I agree with you, but everyone here thinks it is hating or whatever. It is still a great kill, but it is no more impressive than their 5% kill. If you can find their old logs I bet everything is nearly equal from their first kill. They have how many h lk weapons in the raid compared to last time? <br />
<br />
The buffless kill is equal to the 5% if you look at raw damage/healing..</div></div><hr />

Gear has something to do with it, including a low turn over rate withing their roster.<br />
But I doubt its the only reason.<br />

Most of their healers might still use Val. Either way, those 284 weapons even with ilvl 284 trinkets/rings from Halion, aint adding up to a 10k dps loss, then without buff..<br />
<br />
Paragon did it for an accomplishment, but what sucks is that no matter what they do, people won't be pleased or will have something bad to say.<br />
<br />
I think they might have to do it in 264's no heroic gear no shadowmournes for people to be happy.<br />
<br />
No, thats not what sucks, who cares about what others think about their kill? <br />
What sucks is that no matter what they do, they won´t be please with themselves. Just read their own news about the kill. I am sure they are still happy about this kill, but they don´t seem to be impressed with themselves. Sucks for them. But I bet the disconnect made the kill a lot more entertaining :D</div></div><hr />

Maybe because nobody cares to? Do you gain a special achievement? No. Do you get super heroic loot were everything becomes Ilevel 300 and legendary that he drops?

Others maybe did not care about doing the boss after a lof of kills with one hand on the back? As far as I know I did the first Karazhan Solo Run on my server. Does this mean no one else could have done this? No, it just means I was the only one bored enough to waste 2 hours on it while waiting for ulduar release. <br />
Paragon wrote themselves that it was no big deal even with 24 people. Wanna bet that it was a bigger challenge for them the first time they killed Arthas in Heroic? <br />
<br />
Still, with 0% and 24 people a nice kill. Maybe even something no one else could to right now. Maybe not.<br />

<br />
You are absolute right. Seems like only the dedicated player to challanging content quite, those who just did not care are still around. Jk&#8230; still your point is moot, as you talk about a different kind of dedication, or should I write addiction?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Or, you could do what we always did when a new VoA boss opened, go as a guild and simply /roll. It makes much more sense to keep all the loot in guild instead of losing it to randoms in a PUG.<br />
<br />
You don´t lose that way loot, you gain. At least if you build those random groups to your own advantages. 4 Druids, 3 Palas, all Random but only a single one of each class of your guild members ;-)<br />
No roll at all in most cases. More loot for your guild and more important no TIME WASTED. Ok, I admit thats not a faktor anymore in LK as progress time compared to time spend farming bosses is extrem short. Something which was quite different in BC and Vanilla.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am beginning to understand. Your just trying to justify your own failures, is this not your point? If this kill is super duper special and even more amazing than for example 'Alone in the Dark' or the original LK HM kill, than you do not feel so bad about your own raid progress. Instead if people like the guys from paragon telling you those hardmode kills are not that special, your own progress is turned down. <br />
<br />
Why that hate? Hey, there are people who play this game for a long time or really intense, they have a lot of experience and are most likely better than most players. If its not that hard for them it can be still hard for others, you do not have to feel bad, just enjoy your game. Just like they do, when they do a boss fight like this one just for the lulz, just to see if they can do this.<br />
<br />
Though I admit this is a general LK Problem, with content streamlined for the mainstream for a lot raiders the achievment feeling after a boss kill is replaced with an anchievment entry in blizzards database. I remember how happy with gratulate even the last guys who did a personal firstkill with their raid, no matter how much they outgeared the encounter or how much the encounter was down tuned. They still had to work for their kill and everyone respected this. Now it is hard to respect even his own kills.<br />

I think we do understand it just fine. Let's for example take my DK, he has a 6041 GS, in full 264 gear, except for a 245 trinket (Death's Choice). If I go through and upgrade all my pieces to BiS from 25 HM's (which most of their toons have), it bumps my GS up to around 6700, and according to the two simulators I ran, it increases my DPS by 14% (which is a full 9% more than the 5% buff was giving them when they first killed him). So given the time that has taken place from when they first killed him, and now, and the amount of gear they've acquired. I'm pretty sure they've all picked up more than a 5% boost from their gear alone. Don't believe me, go do the simulation's yourself, the number's don't lie.</div></div><hr />

however what people say do have some merit, if they want the boss down 'truly' without the 0% buff, they should use the available gear from that time, but its still a very good feat.<br />
<br />
someone quoted &quot;The encounter wasn't that challenging, the only problem was getting everyone to stay online the whole encounter.&quot; from their site.<br />
<br />
But -&gt; Older post from paragons site<br />
”This is definitely the most challenging boss in WoW history, and I’ve been there among the first to kill Horsemen in Naxx-40 and whatnot. Everything else up to this point pales in comparison. The encounter is extremely ruthless in the sense that anyone making a mistake will almost instantly lead to a raid-wide wipe. The fight itself requires almost 20-minutes of full-on concentration coupled with very high personal skill-level.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quite simply the perfect end-boss to finish the expansion with, couldn’t have hoped for more. My hat is off to Blizzard on this one. I can’t wait to see if this encounter can be outdone in Cataclysm.”<br />

It's just not important. I can barely care about a regular LK kill. I feel satisfied just seeing how the story goes. Of course, then I was in my 20s and now I'm in my 30s. Dunno the ages of people in guilds like paragon.</div></div><hr />

It's probably impossible to manage the enrage timer with 264 gear since they were so so close to wipe with the 5% buff and 277 gear :p</div></div><hr />

Let's for example take my DK, he has a 6041 GS, in full 264 gear, except for a 245 trinket (Death's Choice). If I go through and upgrade all my pieces to BiS from 25 HM's (which most of their toons have), it bumps my GS up to around 6700, and according to the two simulators I ran, it increases my DPS by 14% (which is a full 9% more than the 5% buff was giving them when they first killed him). So given the time that has taken place from when they first killed him, and now, and the amount of gear they've acquired. I'm pretty sure they've all picked up more than a 5% boost from their gear alone. Don't believe me, go do the simulation's yourself, the number's don't lie.<br />
<br />
Whenever anyone mentions GS, they lose a lot of credibility. Just saying.</div></div><hr />

This is absolutely true.<br />
It's still impressive, being the first to do it and all. Just not in the same way that one would initially expect- it's impressive they managed to stick together and acquire that 277 gear.</div></div><hr />

So we should only do things for achievements and loot? <br />
<br />
And it's not pointless. Someone had to prove it's possible with out the buff. They probably needed a challenge again because you can't tune the buff back to 5% when they got it. It probably got ridiculously easy with all their practice that they needed to do it with out the buff to keep their interest.</div></div><hr />

You brown nosers are hilarious. You must have some crazy notion in your head that by defending a guild so fiercely, they will grant you some sort of boon. Regardless, this whole thing is silly.

The true glory in the accomplishment is knowing that you did it, not sharing it to the damn world. Secondly, hate to burst your shallow bubbles, but they did this well after the buff hit 30% and Halion came out. They were able to farm 284 gear, Heroic 25 man LK gear, and have the practice for this encounter.<br />
<br />

I think its nice they did it and all but.. do I care... umm no... I mean I see why its on the front page because some people do care and the tops guilds always get things stirring on the forums. But really they are like doing the boss with 5%-10% with their gear being what it is. But congrats to them for doing something for no real reason..

If you are tunneling the boss and doing 17k DPS, but sucks up healer mana by being stupid and not paying attention to survivability, than you are a worse player than the player who saves a healer enough mana to not have to worry about them by being intelligent and does 16k DPS. That is what Cataclysm is supposed to be like.<br />
<br />
In Cataclysm, you will be able to wipe the group by being a damn heal sponge and making your healers go OOM. A good player will learn how to maximize DPS WHILE MINIMIZING damage taken. Damage avoided is healer strain relieved, and in Cataclysm, healer strain relieved will reduce the chance for a wipe.<br />

Your entire argument rests upon your fact that you think it is pointless what they did.........now that is of course your god (boub) given right. The problem is that you belittle a guilds achievements and the people congratulating them.<br />
Now the question is.......why? Didn't your momma tell you to skip the parts you do not like to read on the internet and when you don't have anything nice to say to just keep it to yourself?<br />
<br />
The paragon paragraph is tiny and easy to skip, but you read it anyway and got so angered you had to post your &quot;facts&quot; and insults.<br />

Maybe they got sick of farming it at 30% and wanted another challenge? Maybe they killed it and decided to let people know. Sure, they had 284 gear, but they weren't in full 284s. Heroic Halion gear is perfectly acceptable, since it doesn't require a HLK25 kill. Stop making such a big deal out of it. It's a cool thing, what they did.</div></div><hr />

Ignoring the rest of your LOLUMAD rant, I kindly bolded the parts of your rantagraph that was filled with the most compelling of bullshit. First thing is, you don't grasp how stupid the first bolded statement (I even numbered it for you) you said is. It LITERALLY is a pointless achievement. Literal. If you want, I can even post a link explaining what that means. Secondly, angered? No. I'm simply stating facts and loling that illiterate people like yourself come here simply to shove your face far up the asses of 25 (lolol 24 in this case) people, with no real reason other than to do it. People will complain as to why they are wrong, people will complain as to why they are right. Its stupid either way, all I said was how its ridiculous this is made into an e-peen war on front page news when all it is is a nice pat on the back, never did I say they didn't deserve congrats. You with your simple mindedness threw that in there.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, I think MMO-Champion and the universe revolves around me obviously. I mean, really. Posting my opinion on the internet? My communist mother should have taught me better than to have an opinion other than your own on the internet. My bad.<br />
<br />
Anywho, now that I'm done wasting braincells on your lulzy chunk of spelling errors and stupidity, back to being a dick.<br />

EDIT: Never did I say it wasn't an achievement Hoosier, I was just saying this whole &quot;ITS GOOD ITS BAD&quot; argument is stupid, and it all starts over e-peen wars.</div></div><hr />

Actually I have not seen anyone in the whole thread who said this encounter ain´t challenging. Just a few who mentioned that more impressive than the kill at 5% with a lot less gear and one dd more.<br />
Which is even in line with the statement of the dudes who did the kill. ;-)<br />

It's nice that Paragon did that, I suppose, but doing a boss that you've killed for 14 weeks in a row now that you're geared out the wazoo isn't really impressive.<br />

Like someone else said, their damage now was the same as the damage they did before the buff, which is saying they're doing 25% more damage now because of all their gear<br />
than they did on the original kill. Likewise, their tanks probably have 25% more health and everything is buffed through their gear instead of the buff.<br />
<br />
Their initial kill was impressive. This wasn't. Grats anyways :)</div></div><hr />

I always found it... hmm quite stupid when people would say something like &quot;Hardmode LK isn't dead until a guild kills him without the buff!!!!!!!&quot;. I can't see why people even cared about this in the first place. Glad to see it was paragon to do it though. Since they are the only guild that killed the LK with only the 5 or was it 10% buff (can't seem to remember the amount). <br />
<br />
At any rate congrats to them.</div></div><hr />

Personally I'm of the opinion that world first was world first. This was just for fun and completely meaningless really. Grats to 'em though.</div></div><hr />

First thing is, you don't grasp how stupid the first bolded statement (I even numbered it for you) you said is. It LITERALLY is a pointless achievement. Literal. If you want, I can even post a link explaining what that means. Secondly, angered? No. I'm simply stating facts and loling that illiterate people like yourself come here simply to shove your face far up the asses of 25 (lolol 24 in this case) people, with no real reason other than to do it. People will complain as to why they are wrong, people will complain as to why they are right. Its stupid either way, all I said was how its ridiculous this is made into an e-peen war on front page news when all it is is a nice pat on the back, never did I say they didn't deserve congrats. You with your simple mindedness threw that in there.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, I think MMO-Champion and the universe revolves around me obviously. I mean, really. Posting my opinion on the internet? My communist mother should have taught me better than to have an opinion other than your own on the internet. My bad.<br />
<br />
Anywho, now that I'm done wasting braincells on your lulzy chunk of spelling errors and stupidity, back to being a dick.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Never did I say it wasn't an achievement Hoosier, I was just saying this whole &quot;ITS GOOD ITS BAD&quot; argument is stupid, and it all starts over e-peen wars.<br />
<br />
<br />
Again you seem so angry with all your insults and slang and yet you call my post a &quot;LOLUMAD rant&quot;. Also I am German and English is my second language so there may be some errors in my posts.......I am truly sorry for that......really.......<br />
<br />
Also you should look up what &quot;fact&quot; means, opinions /= facts. And everything you stated, from &quot;pointless&quot; to &quot;showing off your epeen&quot; are opinions now that is a fact.<br />
<br />
<br />
never did I say they didn't deserve congrats. You with your simple mindedness threw that in there<br />
<br />
Well how will I be able to congratulate them if stuff like that wont be posted anymore? I only check mmo champion for news and always appreciate a wide variety of topics.<br />
<br />
<br />
First thing is, you don't grasp how stupid the first bolded statement (I even numbered it for you) you said is&quot;<br />
<br />
Well there was a typo, instead or &quot;your fact&quot; it should have been &quot;the fact&quot;. And the fact is that all you said is just your opinion and nothing else.<br />
<br />
<br />
People will complain as to why they are wrong, people will complain as to why they are right.<br />

I love me some troll bait, you sir, are idiot numero uno in this forum as of right now. Congratulations. Out of everyone here, you managed to post the largest and most obnoxious replies I've ever seen. Not only that, they are clogged with bullshit, opinions, and rage over a forum troll who has an opinion. Really, congrats. Your god Boub (Curse now buddy) should make a poast about you now too. Because I love me some quality bait, I will now give a reply to each of your stupid statements individually. Feel special.<br />
<br />
1. I used no slang in my post, your poor grasp of the english language should be a testament to how right I am. LOLUMAD was the show you its stupid to get angry over something on an online forum, and attack a troll over an opinion. Clearly I was right in my assumption that your sub intelligent being and would not listen to subtle reason via forum prodding.<br />
<br />
2. So your telling me that posting an achievement, that isn't an achievement, and having it broadcasted throughout the internet via some guilds blog and now a very popular forum isn't an e-peen boost? It wouldn't make some, if not all, of Paragon feel self important? What Paragon did was amazing, yes, but it deserved nothing more than a pat on the back and simple congrats from those browsing their website. Informing frothing nerds like yourself that they did some &quot;achievement&quot; only fueled a raging fire and argument. Maybe Boub gets some entertainment out of this. I know I do. Long story short, most of what I said, if not all, was a very supported fact (or a highly supported opinion).<br />
<br />
3. Well then, I suppose the SMART thing to do would be to check their website, right?<br />
<br />
4. This one is just hilarious. So you bogarting that they deserve congratulations for something like this, and that people who think otherwise are idiots, isn't an opinion? Thats fact? I lol'd heartily at how much of not only a frothing nerd you are, but a hypocrite as well.<br />
<br />
5. That one clearly confused you, considering how you cannot even put it into words, and instead utilize a question mark. My point was, this whole argument is stupid. People will fight over who is right all the time, over who's opinion is more right. Thats why these &quot;news posts&quot; are stupid as a form of news, and amazing as a form of entertainment.<br />
<br />
6. Read your filth ridden comment? You could barely even spot the sarcasm in mine, let alone comprehend it. &quot;Fact&quot; is, your as much an opinionated jackass as 85% of everyone else here. But back to my sarcasm. If you don't know what that means either, I can also link that definition.<br />
<br />
Anywho, I'm having fun. Please keep spouting filth so I can keep making you look like a hypocritical moron who clearly lacks the brain power to distinguish opinion from fact, let alone spot clearly defined sarcasm. <br />
<br />
&lt;3<br />
<br />
EDIT: I think I accidentally made my post sound a little like Paragon has a ego, not what I meant. My apologies. I more of meant to express how it would give them a sense of pride, and it should. Posting it on their website is perfectly fine. I meant that when MMO-Champion decides to cover it, that's when the flames are fueled and childish arguments over e-peen erupt.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zYN</div><div class="date">2010-07-29, 10:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've personally tried a few times to get people interested on killing LK without the buff. Roughly half or third of the players couldn't be bothered until we heard a handful of other guilds were attempting to kill LK without the buff as well. At that point we just simply decided to do it on next reset when it's back up again and started planning. Pretty much everyone was excited again on getting to try to do something new and that there was actual competition too.<br />
<br />
We didn't claim it was an incredible feat, nor did we claim anything else tbh. We just simply wanted to do that last self-made achievement before the handful of other guilds trying it would get it done. We aren't really trying to get the &quot;respect&quot; and &quot;props&quot; from some poor forum trolls - that would be some horrible motivation. I suspect every one of us play because it's fun.<br />
<br />
It was fun preparing for it, because everyone was expecting a huge challenge. It was also a lot of fun killing it. That's pretty much just it. Also it's usually quite funny to read the really sour forum comments afterwards from people none of us even know.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's still a damn hard encounter for anyone trying to learn it at lower gear levels, probably the hardest one there has been. It still requires only one guy to screw up a defile or something else and it's still a wipe - had that happen a few times even now. After killing LK more than a dozen times with pretty sick gear, it's just not that hard for us anymore - first kill was definitely a lot harder to pull off. Now the Valks didn't get even close to the edges even once as far as I remember. Even with all of that said, LK without the zone-wide buff remains the toughest challenge there is without a doubt. I suspect there's not much more than a handful of guilds who can pull it off even nowadays after gearing up and practicing it for months.<br />
<br />
There's also a reason though as to why there's roughly 3000 recorded heroic Sindragosa kills on Wowprogress and why there's only 300 Lich King kills still, even at +30% buff. Anyone who can kill Lich King on heroic still gets my respect and should be happy on their accomplishment. Hell, anyone downing anything can be proud of what they achieved as long as it was fun for them and they liked it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for the gratses and stuff too though - but you should save most of it for Cataclysm. :)</div></div><hr />

No really though, people will stop participating? Boub just posted this yesterday and already got 10 pages of sincere congratulations, genuine conversation about expansion goodies, and arguments about Paragon. 10 pages, in one day.

4 months ago world first: http://www.wowmeteronline.com/combat/13662030#damageout<br />
Buffless kill: http://www.wowmeteronline.com/combat/15651712#damageout<br />
<br />
Can you tell the difference??<br />
<br />
No one can take it away from them, it is a great feat. But it is no more impressive then their world first kill.<br />
This is what you should be looking at:<br />
World first - Total Damage : 156,240,283 [ DPS : 170120 ], Combat Time: 15:18<br />
Buffless kill - Total Damage : 156,804,204 [ DPS : 171030 ], Combat Time: 15:17<br />
I bolded it for convenience. Almost exactly the same raid wide dps and fight duration. Looking at this data it's practically a carbon copy of their first kill, the kill they themselves proclaimed as the hardest boss in wow history and for this kill it was just &quot;The encounter wasn't that challenging..&quot;. So why the discrepancy? Practice. No amount of gear will compensate for lack of practice in a certain encounter and practice can definitely compensate for lack of gear in any encounter that isn't a simple dps race. The point i'm trying to make is what someone has already mentioned on this tread. Zone buff has only sped up natural progression through ICC. That's the only purpose it served to all the top guilds racing for world first. All it does is compensates for lack of gear that guilds would eventually acquire. So talking about how the first kill doesn't matter because it's done with 5% buff and how this one doesn't matter because its done with uber gear is completely moot. They would eventually get there. It would take them longer but they would get there and they would still be the 1st.<br />
<br />
The greatest irony is when someone is pointing at something they find pointless and then go into great detail to explain why it's so pointless. &quot;Hey everybody, check out this completely pointless thing here! I'm proud to say i personally have great amount of information on why this thing here is so pointless, and i'm gonna share them with you!&quot;. Don't you find all that a bit.. Pointless..<br />

UMAD Bro? Seems all you can do is make fun of something I don't even have, rather than point out valid points of how I'm wrong on the subject. : | People like you are the best troll bait of all. Simpletons who, rather than state valid points or hell, even attempt to politely show me why I am so wrong, you rage hard and throw childish insults like a 10 year old. I also like your edit, your desperate attempt to start talking back about the subject at hand because you couldn't put it anything that made sense in that string of 1st grade insults. I lol'd.<br />
<br />
On another note that doesn't have to do with Ficheks as of yet to descend &quot;maturity&quot;, Improved Campire for King.</div></div><hr />

Keep ragin bro. I'm going to keep on loling. My mom taught me words like irony when I was a kid too bro. Doesn't mean I ran around like an idiot and improperly used them. But hell, please keep up the fantastic show. Your idiocy is quite lulzy.<br />

Off of Ficheks poor lack of intelligence though, why DID Blizzard see fit to improve our future king, Basic Campfire, but not old world races?</div></div><hr />

It's always nice showing the meaning of irony to your kids. Really makes them feel (snap irony incoming!) loved and cared for. Rather than teaching you about irony, your mom should have thought you more about facial care. Facial care and Basic Campfire is where it's all at! I'm simply appalled how shallow the world we live in is. I vote NO for shallow world, NO for pimples (?) and YES for improved Basic Campfire.</div></div><hr />

It's not a twink, it's a main of one of the new trials. Definitely gives the tanks more motivation and compete with him on the meters.</div></div><hr />

The fact that you do not care says nothing about how much of an accomplishment this is. Besides, everyone knows the most difficult things to do in the game do not reward you with anything except for the right to brag.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's nice that Paragon did that, I suppose, but doing a boss that you've killed for 14 weeks in a row now that you're geared out the wazoo isn't really impressive.<br />
<br />
Like someone else said, their damage now was the same as the damage they did before the buff, which is saying they're doing 25% more damage now because of all their gear<br />
than they did on the original kill. Likewise, their tanks probably have 25% more health and everything is buffed through their gear instead of the buff.<br />
<br />
Their initial kill was impressive. This wasn't. Grats anyways :)<br />

Not to mention the several Shadowmournes they must have by now; they are the best of WotLK but some things weren't accomplish and one of them is LK hard w pure 0% (full 277 sort of neglect that).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghostyamine</div><div class="date">2010-08-02, 11:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, first off, you're making a pretty big assumption that full 277 (and I'm not quite sure what you define as full 277 - trinkets etc) is exactly equal to the 5% buff and that the kill wasn't also accomplished due to refined gameplay as well.<br />
<br />
Second, all the 5% buff did was reverse the natural progression of final raid boss encounters by allowing skilled players (not me) the chance to down the boss before being 100% geared for it. In the old days it would have taken almost this long for them to get everyone geared up enough.<br />
<br />
It also shows to me that these guys are dedicated enough and true enough fans of the game to want to do it without the buff and take pride in their game. Why haven't the other big guilds with similar gear accomplished this? Not getting paid enough?<br />
<br />
oh and btw why not just be polite and congratulate them on accomplishing something you never will.<br />
i wonder how many of their plate dps had shadowmourne</div></div><hr />
