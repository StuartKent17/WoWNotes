Pretty sure those will just be the new guild achievement rewards, I doubt they're making shirts an actual gear slot. Imagine a guild tabard or cloak, but in shirt form.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are pretty boring, but you have to keep in mind that this is the first raiding tier of MoP. Look back at T11 or T7, for instance. Most of them are just boring damage/healing increase or a small cooldown reduction for certain abilities. The following tiers are likely going to be a bit more creative.</div></div><hr />

It does suck for these guilds. I'm in one of these myself, but I have one of my alts in one of those level 25 guilds who just take in anybody for the gold perk so I can buy my heirlooms and stuff with that character. To be fair the guild &quot;perk&quot; of being in a small guild of friends vastly outweighs anything Blizzard could put in the game so it kinda balances out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is by far the best patch note an enhance shaman could receive. I assume you are somewhat familiar with the class then you know our nuke builds on the target then we lava lash it. The Searing stacks go on us now is the change the FL weapon was to balance out the searing stack loss. Now we can target switch, choose what targets we want to nuke, carry our combo points on us when our target dies, ect. The only tears that will be shed are of joy because they fixed a significant issue with the class in Cata.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree. Even though it's still beta (subject to change), in the best case scenario the only thing that will change is numbers. 10 seconds cooldown instead of 12 or something. <br />
<br />
These are just bland, unimaginative like said, and not interesting at all. The fun of getting a 2p or 4p will (yet again) be 'Yay I'm getting about 2300 dps increase overall by having my nuke ability do 5% more damage. This is so much fun!'. <br />
<br />
Blizzard should realize that raw number editing (increase in damage, decrease in cooldown) is not fun for people as a bonus. We already have a pretty much linear and plain stat increase with iLvls. We do not need the same logic in set bonuses. Of course 2p/4p should be an upgrade, and people should strive for it. But it should be something valuable, something fun, something people can experiment. <br />
<br />
It saddens me that a lot of feedback regarding itemization was not well received on Blizzards end during a whole expansion life cycle (Cata).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
That is still not a proper justification for unimaginative bonuses. This is an MMO. Designers should learn from their mistakes and reflect on them to evolve a progressing game. The same approach is also in Diablo 3. Legendaries are called legendaries, but they have absolutely nothing to make them fun or interesting right now. <br />
<br />
Set items should therefore be set items not because they look different from one another, but they should bring in fun bonuses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh for pete's sake...they're completely redoing the way talents and classes work/play between expansions. That's why the first bonus is always bland...you are just getting your hands on something new. If they made the set-bonuses for T14 the ones we had from T13, with all the class changes that MoP introduced, nothing would make sense.<br />
<br />
The first tier is always simple to let players learn how a class feels while still giving them a bonus for clearing raid content. They get better as an expansion goes along. Seriously, it's getting to the point that it seems no one has ever seen an expansion launch before.</div></div><hr />
