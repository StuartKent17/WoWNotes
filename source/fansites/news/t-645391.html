The above is a comment, which you expressed with words. Badly.<br />
<br />
Anyways...<br />
<br />
It's a little dissappointing to hear about the nerfs, honestly. But I'm certainly not upset enough to throw a spaz over it. I've done it pre-nerf - not often I've gotten to say that, having started playing just before WotLK came out. Someone print out my elitist bastard membership card, please! ^.^</div></div><hr />

<br />
The 25-man had some strange &quot;wtf&quot; moments that felt out of your control originally like 35k hits on tanks occurring within the first minute of the encounter, but it was still downed and I'm sure we would have originally gone for it.<br />
<br />
Oh well. Thanks for giving us easy access to yet another 2H weapon in 25-Uld, Blizz. Maybe this will make up for 19 weeks of guild 25-Naxx with 0 Betrayer drops. -_-</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I think this important to keep in mind as what blizzard has stated their design philosophy is. If you are in full 213/226 gear doing 10 man then it should be on the easy side. These changes fit blizzard's new philosophy of making the regular modes accessible to many while having hard modes for those liking a challenge.</div></div><hr />

i mean the spacing of the mole machines in the razorscale fight were more annoying then challenging. <br />
<br />
and i agree with another poster in saying that the nerfs are to widen the gap between normal and hard modes.</div></div><hr />

I wanted to congratulate you on getting all the way through Iron Council last night! I think it's impressive that people who are progressing slower than the average guild on 25 man normal modes is complaining about how easy the instance is.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sturmbringe</div><div class="date">2009-04-22, 11:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think thats dramatic. If you aren't bright you will be struggling emmensely with Ulduar 10 or 25, period. They simply want it to be DOABLE for the less-bright while offering those who consider themselves higher level players the option to make the encounter truly insane and obviously get rewarded with the best loot.<br />
<br />
*Rest of this post not directed at you*<br />
<br />
And if thats too tough, then those guys can destroy the nerfed normal modes to gear up and try hardmode again next reset. Its a perfectly reasonable system and I repeat the only ones with a problem with any of this are butthurt losers who didn't get their Yogg non-hard kills in pre-nerf. <br />
<br />
I realize its a bit of a let down for those who were going through ulduar at a perfect pace, but at the end of the day, if making the content last that long means that much to you, you probably need to get outside and go tackle the problems you're trying to avoid by focusing so much into the game. The point should be to see Ulduar, anyone saying &quot;I wanted it to last for months and months&quot; is just a loser who was praying Blizz would have a way for them to spend 8 hours a night so they can avoid their life a bit more. Now they're mad that they'll get to Yogg quicker and be back in Dalaran messing around in /Trade more, when the issue is you've let the game become that thing you do every night to get you through to the next day and no matter what Blizzard does, you won't be happy cause you're living a terrible life. You're a sad, sad person if the thought of other people accomplishing as much as you in a game as skillless and unsatisfiying as WoW is in the first place sets you off so bad. WoW is great fun but its not great skill and you should not take any pride in anything you do much like you don't take pride while playing a fun game of Mario Party. Save the pride for games that take skill/smarts, all we do is test our ability to follow written directions in unison.<br />
<br />
The funniest thing is, the people that are complaining are the people who wouldn't even be in Ulduar if all the encounters were hard-mode only. You guys ARE the bads that blizzard is catering to with these nerfs, just like me and anyone else not doing hard mode yet. The only difference is, some of you are in denial and truly think you're something special and that these nerfs will make it harder for you to prove it. Its bull****, I repeat go do Hardmode or STFU and quit acting like any of it is an accomplishment anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
The issue is as follows:<br />
<br />
1. Blizzard makes changes or adjustments to the game based on mass complaining (i.e. QQ) at the US Forums. If you'd get mass US forums QQ that &quot;the sky in WoW sucks because it's blue. It should have been green&quot; you can be certain that Blizzard would make the sky in-game green, largely because of the QQ started by level 1 Gnome forum trolls.<br />
<br />
2. It was in fashion for patch 3.08-3.0.9, for everyone and their dog to get a US forums account and complain that &quot;the game was too easy&quot;. What they should have said was that &quot;there is too little content&quot;, or &quot;that the current 25 man content can be cleared in one sigle day&quot;.<br />
<br />
Why was there mass US forums QQ that the game &quot;was too easy&quot;? Simply because the people making these statements are all newbies who have started playing WoW in TBC, typically Horde Belf Loladins or even DK's in WOTLK.<br />
<br />
These people really have no idea of what WoW used to be like when the Horde was the Horde and the Alliance was the Alliance. They can't imagine raid progress that lasted for 2 years, and they don't even know that 1% of the raiding guilds worldwide got to see Original un-nerfed 40 man Naxxramas. But, the problem is NOT that the level 1 Gnome forum trolls and the Belf Loladins set out to make these statements at the US forums because that's what one expects from forum trolls.<br />
<br />
The issue here is in fact that the vets at Blizzard actually got to listen to the Forum Trolls, forgetting or discarding the LESSONS LEARNED from 2.5 years of Vanilla WoW raiding. So here we are now back to Vanilla-style progress. My guild now raids every single day for progress instead of raiding 1 or 2 days a week. That's exactly what we used to do back in Vanilla and TBC. <br />
<br />
So, we have come full circle back to the old days. I really do think that Bliz overdid it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ubergoat</div><div class="date">2009-04-23, 12:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, as people have mentioned with hard mode mechanics you can get the same challenge you were looking for before, depending on how long you want to spend in ulduar per week (hourly basis) you can do more or less hard modes so that you can still clear the place, but get the challenge you want. On the flip side, people saying hard modes are too hard and now gonna spend all day every day wiping in ulduar, well just go do some easy modes until you get some gear or suck it up and just put the effort in like the top guilds in the world did, if you want to be on the same playing field as them you gotta earn it. <br />
<br />
Honestly, I think the concept of what blizzard is doing is perfect and the implementation needs work, but on the other hand they're human and cant ever effectively gauge how well people will perform until actually seen in action. Really, for you guys QQing about content being too easy, if you truly are some of the people who are so awesome and leet, you would be part of the 1-2% minority across all of WoW who would see raid content. With blizzard changing it so a much larger number like say 25% of wow can at least step foot in ulduar, it is doing nothing but HELPING you. Back in vanilla, with the guarantee that only 1-2% of the player base would see content, logically they would only put around 1-2% of their resources into creating and balancing content. Nowadays with a much larger number, we're going to see more cash going into our raids and thus more inventive and interesting raids. <br />
<br />
You might argue that all they're doing is recycling mechanics and encounters that they arent really doing anything different from vanilla, but now you gotta think about how much more they are putting into each specific encounter. In vanilla it would be more like &quot;we want a boss to hit hard&quot; and kinda leave it at that, thats really not that much effort put into a boss fight after the mechanic is figured out and whatnot. If you go ahead and look at wrath now, they'll say &quot;We want the boss to require X DPS to hit the enrage timer and the healers need to be able to do Y tank healing as well as Z raid healing&quot;, to get those numbers not only do they have to put a lot of research into how much raid healing and tank healing and DPS (as well as making sure TPS will scale well with DPS) people will be capable of at that gear level, they then have to take this number and figure out how to balance it so that the raid and tank are taking that amount of damage over the fight, but so that it doesn't one shot people who are appropriately geared. Really...how about you try predicting accurately to within 100 DPS how much DPS you're going to do with a complete talent revamp, gear all +16 in item level compared to what you have now and tuning a boss based on that number. You can't really expect blizzard to be able to do that consistently each and every time, the result is the nerfbat when predicted HPS, DPS etc dont quite line up with predictions.</div></div><hr />

If you've done 10-man Razorscale already, you'll know how much of a pain in the ass it is for 2 healers to have to deal with healing two tanks, and then to have 9k damage fireballs hitting raid members every 2 seconds.<br />
<br />
<br />
10men is a joke. So is Razorscale or any other Boss. Btw: ever heard of bringing a 3rd healer ? Or not entering Ulduar with Blues/crappy il200 ?</div></div><hr />

It was fine how it was, if anything, it should of been made harder.<br />
<br />
<br />
They want Ulduar to be a step up from Naxx, but not a c**kblock.<br />
Hardmode is meant to be hard, regular ulduar should be possible to be completed by most guilds.</div></div><hr />

A joke on 10men ? thats not realy the right word i believe. That where it is not particularly hard, some encounters are not exactly easy.</div></div><hr />
