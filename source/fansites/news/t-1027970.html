Mists of Pandaria Talent Calculator Unofficial Patch Notes<br />
What kind of site MMO-Champion would be if we left you with a bunch of picture and a couple of &quot;ok, shit changed, go figure it out!&quot;? Not a very good site, I tell you. <br />
<br />
That's why my wonderful (and slightly crazy) moderators worked all day to bring you an almost complete list of changes since what we've seen at Blizzcon! But before we jump aboard the class changes train, a word of warning from the best safety advisor out there, Bashiok. <br />
We wanted to take a moment to give some context to why the calculators were posted, and the permanence of the data shown. A lot of times we say things like &quot;not final&quot; and &quot;may change&quot; as verbal wiggle room should we decide we need to go a different direction, or are unable to complete something in time. In this case of the Mists of Pandaria calculator data is essentially pre-alpha, and will absolutely change in many ways.<br />
<br />
It was important for us to get this stuff in front of you as soon as possible though (and as a work in progress as it is) to get your feedback, which will in no small part influence that change. We also wanted to present everything on a single page to give you a fuller context for the initial talent changes we announced at BlizzCon, and to see how the overall structure of core abilities, spec abilities, and talents will function, with concrete examples.<br />
<br />
The calculator contains elements that are experimental, still in the process of implementation, or in some cases outright failed experiments that we already intend to revise or replace. Odds are good that if it looks like we’ve forgotten some critical piece of a particular class toolkit, it’s either accounted for elsewhere, or simply a data glitch (e.g., Prayer of Healing is currently absent from the calculator – we are not taking Prayer of Healing away from priests, and Devastate for warriors probably won't sunder armor 453%). Our hope is that revealing the calculator in this state will shed light on the philosophy behind our talent overhaul, and let you get a sense of how pieces of your core rotational gameplay, such as Hot Streak, Riptide, or Sudden Doom, fit into the new system.<br />
<br />
The different classes are also at very different stages of design and implementation, and the fact that some mechanics changes we discussed at BlizzCon and in recent Q&amp;As are not yet present does not mean that we have abandoned those ideas.<br />
<br />
Any and all feedback is very welcome, but please keep all of the above in mind when considering the information in the talent calculator, and please keep feedback consolidated in the Mists of Pandaria forum: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/2592425/<br />
<br />
And now, the super awesome list of compiled changes, thanks to all the moderators who worked on that including Simca (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/545200-Simca), Malefic (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/525040-Malefic), Madgod (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/559801-The-Madgod), Migari (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/546785-Migari), Radux (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/546665-Radux), and many others who are going to hate me because I forgot to mention them! <br />

To other posters: keep in mind that the calculator is incomplete, as noted by Bashiok, so if your favorite spells are missing that's why (again, as noted by Bashiok).<br />

I'm certain people will still panic, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good. <br />
<br />
Every new MMO coming out is aping WoW's talent trees and it's huge flaws to a T. Blizzard going down this new path is great, and shows that they're willing to take risks still.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, this new tree system gives you more choices than the existing trees do. Unless you like piling in arbitrary points in such a way that it broke your effectiveness, this does away with the lack of choice players have when attempting to spec themselves for PvP/PvE.</div></div><hr />

The calculator contains elements that are experimental, still in the process of implementation, or in some cases outright failed experiments that we already intend to revise or replace. Odds are good that if it looks like we’ve forgotten some critical piece of a particular class toolkit, it’s either accounted for elsewhere, or simply a data glitch (e.g., Prayer of Healing is currently absent from the calculator – we are not taking Prayer of Healing away from priests, and Devastate for warriors probably won't sunder armor 453%). Our hope is that revealing the calculator in this state will shed light on the philosophy behind our talent overhaul, and let you get a sense of how pieces of your core rotational gameplay, such as Hot Streak, Riptide, or Sudden Doom, fit into the new system.I'm personally not making any sort of judgements on any of the lack of spells or supposed spec exclusive abilities until the trees are far more polished.</div></div><hr />

Healing stream will be something you can choose while leveling. Really the only things that were removed were purge and water breathing. Everything else Shamans don't need.</div></div><hr />

Deep Freeze [updated] Is now trainable by all specs.<br />

Interesting combination... won't it be fun to have pyroblasts and arcane blasts (with stacking AB debuffs) get 3x crit? Certainly not as easy to pull off a deep freeze for arcane and fire as it is for frost, but it still...<br />
<br />
PvP is going to be interesting during the Pandaclysm.<br />
<br />
(Replying to my own stuff lol).<br />
<br />
My bad, all mage specs will have access to the talent Frostjaw, which freezes on demand. So, no, it won't be hard to pull off a deep freeze on demand and feed someone Arcane Blasts with ABx4 stacked with 3x crit chance while they are stunned for 5 seconds.</div></div><hr />

I liked the way priests were the swing joint for raid make up. Priests could tank heal or raid heal pretty well. now it just seems holy is the only way to be now. and this is coming from a giant Disc. priest lover. sad to see my favorite spec go to the trash can. But other classes have seen that and did well so holy here i come forever now. The idea of giving choices has been taken away with having healing abilities taken away from one spec to the other.</div></div><hr />

Right now, it seems as though they are taking away A LOT of pvp viability for the entire shaman class.

<br />
Healing Stream Totem - I use this as a raiding Resto Shaman. Besides providing a nice little bit of healing, what other water totem will we use? Mana Spring doesn't stack with Might. The Healing Surge totem that you're referring to is more of a healing cooldown. Medium to large AoE heal on a cooldown. No me gusta.<br />
<br />
Stoneclaw Totem - Okay, so I don't use it THAT much. Glyphed in PvP is nice. Also a 16k shield isn't *that* bad during a raid. Again, what other earth totem am I going to drop?<br />
<br />
Purge - I like my dispel. I like it a lot. I don't want to give it up.<br />
<br />
Totem Callers - Does this mean we have to go back to dropping individual totems again? That was never fun.<br />
<br />
Water Breathing - Yeah...didn't use that one. At least we're keeping Water Walking.<br />
<br />
Lava Burst - Doing any sort of damage as Resto is annoying enough as is. At least LB provided a little something. Now it's gone.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
Magma Totem - Our only real AoE ability as Resto. It had its uses.<br />
<br />
Rockbiter Weapon - Shit, that's still in the game?</div></div><hr />

Sounds absolutely useless, seeing as how there will probably be no undead mobs in the expansion. This might have been useful in Wrath, but not now and not in the future. Add Demon control to the list and maybe it won't seem so bad. At this point though DK's are pretty much being spit on by the developers. As to why Festering Strike will be exclusive to Unholy is beyond me, if they don't want Frost to use it then they better make it so that Obliterate doesn't hit like a broken wet noodle on resilience geared players, cause honestly sub-15k crits in Cataclysm is an absolute insult to the primary ability of the Frost spec.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. Talents improve the role you play in the game. Real talents would be for example as a healing paladin<br />
<br />
1. Your beacon does a 50% healing to person with the beacon of every heal<br />
2. Your beacon does 10% healing to 5 players in your group within range of every heal<br />
3. Your beacon gives a 5% healing to every player in the raid within range of your heals<br />
<br />
Those are real choises. It changes the role from beeing a single target healer into beeing a raid healer. It makes the spec more viable for entire content of the game without giving it everything at once.<br />
<br />
This is just an example of REAL choises instead of giving me choise if a run 40% speed for X time or 65% speed for Y time and blabla speed for 2 sec on judgments.....</div></div><hr />

- No mana cost effective Heal (Holy only)<br />
- No Renew (the only Priest HoT available)<br />
- No Binding Heal (single handledly one of THE best pvp and pve healing toolbox spells created for both shadow and healers, now Holy only)<br />
<br />
That's just one example. I didn't care less about Pandas, I was curious as always about the talent tree but now looking at the current state of the specs and spellbooks the game has turned a vet player who was open minded to almost everything that came out a pube hair away from fucking off this game entirely and going up the road to get a second hand console. I have utterly no idea what the fuck they are playing at with each spec and homogenisation, not to mention totally killing off various specs I used to love and play for years.<br />

That's a nice concept, but then having to create 6 groups of 3 talents all balanced with each other when they give throughput increases with all the classes might be a bit unrealistic.<br />
<br />
I like this direction, situational abilities for all specs ensures a greater chance of total balance and seem more fun to me :)<br />

Sit tight, send feedback, wait for beta, send more feedback, wait for launch, then send your complaints if you have any.<br />
<br />
Yeah I know (: I only have my previous experience to go on here; after all the constructive posts made about classes and spec imbalances and how long the Hunter class in particular went for so long being subpar or all the little niggles and tweaks that could have been made, since it was the most fundamentally changed class in Cata - and Disc being a mascot spec for a good while too - I'm a bit wary, so forgive me.<br />
<br />
A lot of work was obviously put into MoP to show at Blizzcon, but the system they're asking for feedback on looks so unfinished and so early build it actually looks like they took the game apart to smack the engine with a spanner and are now asking us for help putting it back together with superglue before the 'rents get back home xD</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I like this direction, situational abilities for all specs ensures a greater chance of total balance and seem more fun to me :)<br />
<br />
There is nothing balanced about the current talent trees. Many of them are worthless to entire specs and are now used as special talent in another specs. ANd then they take 3 special talents that are all in holy spec and put it in the same tier. Taking away 2 talents that we are able to have WITH each other atm. That is called nerfing. DIrect nerfing.<br />
<br />
Example <br />
<br />
Eternal Glory<br />
<br />
Tier 1 prot talent right now that is used by many holy palas but is not essential in any way. It used to help other specs until the WOG nerf and was a good Tier 1 extra buff. Nothing more. ANd now... its one of 3 choises for tier 4? It sorta tells you exactly how totally and utterly worthless the other 2 are if you expect them to have equal value for the class....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you not get how shaman works? People, read what they said at Blizzcon. Shamans don't drop totems for buffs anymore, they're all utility, like CDs you use when you need them. There's a totem now that gives a shield to the shaman every 5 seconds for 30 seconds that blocks any kind of damage for X amount. That replaced glyph stoneclaw. The old way was just ridiculous, has been since vanilla, part of why they just gave each faction paladin/shaman in BC, and is a welcome change. Totems are super cool now.<br />
<br />
I can't even say enough goodbyes to buff totems.</div></div><hr />

Totems were the worst part about Shaman, unless it was from an RP PoV. Having to drop your totems every 20 seconds on some mobile boss fights, and still come below average on the DPS meters on static fights. They are broken, and only the most dedicated players play Shaman (mainly Enhancement)</div></div><hr />

This has nothing to do with beeing afraid of changes. Ask Paladins how many changes they have gone through in the past 7 years. THey will tell you. BUt they will ALSO tell you that they have been thrown around left right and center beeing left as a &quot;leveling spec&quot; rets - to a special nerf patch. Thats what ppl know is coming. These ideas that BLizzard now has are so utterly unrealistic in terms of overall balance of the game - giving some classes that fill 3 diffrent roles the same options as a pure dps class... or a 2 role class and expecting all the 3 choises in each talent tree to be equally viable. It is not and its for everyone to see.</div></div><hr />

Its not totems that are broken. It is the balancing of the class from BLizzard based around this uniqe ablity that has failed. And instead of admitting their own failure - they get rid of it. THus justifying taking a key feature of a class away. Thats just beyond belive.</div></div><hr />

We wanted to take a moment to give some context to why the calculators were posted, and the permanence of the data shown. A lot of times we say things like &quot;not final&quot; and &quot;may change&quot; as verbal wiggle room should we decide we need to go a different direction, or are unable to complete something in time. In this case of the Mists of Pandaria calculator data is essentially pre-alpha, and will absolutely change in many ways.<br />
<br />
It was important for us to get this stuff in front of you as soon as possible though (and as a work in progress as it is) to get your feedback, which will in no small part influence that change. We also wanted to present everything on a single page to give you a fuller context for the initial talent changes we announced at BlizzCon, and to see how the overall structure of core abilities, spec abilities, and talents will function, with concrete examples.<br />
<br />
The calculator contains elements that are experimental, still in the process of implementation, or in some cases outright failed experiments that we already intend to revise or replace. Odds are good that if it looks like we’ve forgotten some critical piece of a particular class toolkit, it’s either accounted for elsewhere, or simply a data glitch (e.g., Prayer of Healing is currently absent from the calculator – we are not taking Prayer of Healing away from priests, and Devastate for warriors probably won't sunder armor 453%). Our hope is that revealing the calculator in this state will shed light on the philosophy behind our talent overhaul, and let you get a sense of how pieces of your core rotational gameplay, such as Hot Streak, Riptide, or Sudden Doom, fit into the new system.<br />
<br />
The different classes are also at very different stages of design and implementation, and the fact that some mechanics changes we discussed at BlizzCon and in recent Q&amp;As are not yet present does not mean that we have abandoned those ideas.<br />
<br />
Any and all feedback is very welcome, but please keep all of the above in mind when considering the information in the talent calculator, and please keep feedback consolidated in the Mists of Pandaria forum: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/2592425/</div></div><hr />

Unless you're an ex-employee that quit their job because they did not like the direction the game was going in you have no room to speak, period, end of story. We're talking about Blizz afterall, and if any developer deserves the trust of it's player base about any changes that get made to its game it's Blizz. I will admit that sometimes the changes don't seem ;ogical at first but at least WoW perfectly reflects how life actually is in the way it fluctuates and goes through cycles. Depending on what class you play you could be really powerful or really underpowered, and then a patch could change everything. With other games you just learn how they work and then keep playing it until it becomes second nature, however at least with WoW there's times when things feel a little foreign when a new patch goes live. I main a lock and am looking forward to Pandaisland.</div></div><hr />

No one has played the game with this changes so no one can reserve any judgement. Although they will be strange at first, I am sure the changes will all work out.

If they made the area of the totem buff 100 yards, they wouldn't have to fix it in the first place. Saying that, the fire totems never really did their job. Searing totem would some times never fire, and often hit the wrong target anyway. Fire nova was just a very very messy AoE.</div></div><hr />

The main thing was that they were just annoying. As a paladin i'd kill someone if I had to change/renew my aura after every mob pack, never mind set down totems once more and potentially having to change which totems are used on which fights, etc etc. It was just clunky, but they -are- still letting shamans have some totemic spells in the form of CD's (think zealotry or something like that), so they won't be completely lost.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah for fucks sake. They better be reading my bitching. My god if they don't spend some actual fucking time developing Shaman. Basically 10% of the talents are DPS centric/fun talents whilst the rest are terrible utility totems that ALL specs should get or they are healing talents.<br />
<br />
I'm not entirely sure but I've been playing a Shaman since 2004 and I think we are a HYBRID and a THIRD of the class has to do with healing. DURPPPPPP.<br />
<br />
And they are constantly gutting more and more out of the class.<br />
<br />
God damn there better be some FUN and EXCITING talents/abilities coming up for Shaman.<br />
<br />
Improved Ghost Wolf is one of the SIX choices I get to make? Fucking LOL.<br />

Pretty much my feelings on the &quot;Blizzard can do no wrong&quot; fanbois at this point.<br />

I'm also loving the people who &quot;hate&quot; on other classes by saying, &quot;Now you know how we've felt and you're going to feel that way too!!! derp...&quot;<br />

We can handle constructive criticism. But whining and crying isn't tolerated. It isn't big, clever or funny.<br />
<br />
Warrior changes look interesting. More rage generation abilities. Arms doesn't feel 'right' currently, but Fury and Protection look awesome.<br />
<br />
Shaman changes... Well, we'll wait and see. But if they are removing Call of Totems then I hope they are doing something else to replace it. Because I really don't want to individually drop totems again, thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From that very same blizzard quote in this very post: <br />
<br />
&quot;The calculator contains elements that are experimental, still in the process of implementation, or in some cases outright failed experiments that we already intend to revise or replace. Odds are good that if it looks like we’ve forgotten some critical piece of a particular class toolkit, it’s either accounted for elsewhere, or simply a data glitch (e.g., Prayer of Healing is currently absent from the calculator – we are not taking Prayer of Healing away from priests, and Devastate for warriors probably won't sunder armor 453%). Our hope is that revealing the calculator in this state will shed light on the philosophy behind our talent overhaul, and let you get a sense of how pieces of your core rotational gameplay, such as Hot Streak, Riptide, or Sudden Doom, fit into the new system.<br />
<br />
The different classes are also at very different stages of design and implementation, and the fact that some mechanics changes we discussed at BlizzCon and in recent Q&amp;As are not yet present does not mean that we have abandoned those ideas.&quot;<br />
<br />
I bolded the important pieces of information for you. In case people missed them the first time they read the quote, if they even bothered to read it. I have no problems with people creating threads with constructive crisitism about the state of the game. Or future plans for it. <br />
<br />
What I do have a problem with, is people whining about spells missing, talents missing when they clearly state this is just a rough sketch to give us an IDEA of why the new talent system is being implemented in the first place and how it could work out. <br />
<br />
Whether I agree with the changes or not, is not in discussion here. Putting a label on people as &quot;fanboy&quot; because they don't have their panties in a bunch over pre-alpha changes is just really mature, kiddo.</div></div><hr />

It wouldn't matter if it was a aplha build, beta build, post-beta build or a omega build. The reason everyone is mad is that they plan to make these class changes. Even if they don't go through it still means blizzard came up with it. There is a very good chance the majority of these changes willbe permananty if not just slightly tweaked. <br />
The talent trees look like they have some potential , but the class changes are frankly disgusting. I hope they see the light. I never understand people that complain about someone complaining. Blizz needs to hear stuff like this .So complain on people!</div></div><hr />

Now seriously guys - they said that various classes are at different stages of development - if you look at druids we're getting almost every concern we're currently having (no burst aoe heal, hybrid tax on fun tanking skills ) solved - those are still very early rough drafts - if you voice your concerns properly, i'm sure they'll listen.</div></div><hr />

You don't need Call of the Totems anymore since there won't be any totems you wanna spam. For example only water totems left are mana tide and possible healing tide which both have long cd. Also only earth totems left are earthbind totem and tremor totem which both have cd and are for situational use, not spammable. Air totems are grounding totem and spirit link totem which also have cooldown. :cool:<br />

They removed all totems without cd except searing totem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Your beacon does a 50% healing to person with the beacon of every heal<br />
2. Your beacon does 10% healing to 5 players in your group within range of every heal<br />
3. Your beacon gives a 5% healing to every player in the raid within range of your heals<br />
<br />
Those are real choises. It changes the role from beeing a single target healer into beeing a raid healer. It makes the spec more viable for entire content of the game without giving it everything at once.<br />
<br />
This is just an example of REAL choises instead of giving me choise if a run 40% speed for X time or 65% speed for Y time and blabla speed for 2 sec on judgments.....<br />
It's not a choice. It just means you need to respec between every fight, depending if you tank heal or aoe heal. If you look at druid talents you'll see that we're getting a cooldown that improves our performance OUTSIDE of our current spec - ie. moonkin healer or kitty tanking.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is pretty funny, wonder who came up with the last stand idea? :D &quot;your new fun rotation is to pool all your rage so last stand and shield block is up constantly -devs&quot;. It will never go live of course, but the mere idiocy is mind boggling. To even make this work, they would need to remove shield block from the GCD. What happens then, is that every warrior macros shield slam and devastate to shield block, puts the macro on the &quot;1&quot; button, and spams it merrily, since you cant really affort spending rage on anything, when you need 80 rage every 1.5 seconds to function. It really does seem that they want every tank to be broken, just like DK's. From a pretty fun toolset as prot warrior, to a one button wonder. Yup, challenging.<br />
Sometimes i feel like players don't even bother to research whole picture. According to devs tanking will be more pro-active, similar to current dk tanking - ie you spend your rage depending whether you currently need extra threat or survivability - right now i have unlimited rage, making me spam maul on every cd, along with mangle and keeping lacerate up. you can basicaly put it into one cast sequence macro and tank many heroic raid ecounters while watching tv.</div></div><hr />

Extra threat? Devastate is free, revenge is free, shield slam GIVES rage. What more do you need for threat? What they wrote boils down to &quot;never use a rage costing ability, as that hurts your survivability&quot;. Using concussion blow to stun a casting add should be a no brainer, not a &quot;if i do that, ill miss a shield block and i might die&quot; decision.</div></div><hr />

On a Pale Horse is now a trainable passive ability and is available to all Death Knights at level 61.<br />
A new ability, Control Undead, is now available for all Death Knights. Control Undead dominates an undead creature, placing it under your control for up to 5 minutes. While controlled, the creature attacks 30% slower and casts 20% slower. It has a 30 yard range, costs 1 Unholy rune, and has a 1.5 sec cast time.<br />

Yay for the mount speed! The new ability looks pretty cool too.<br />

Ok, so I know those &quot;Call of...&quot; listed here are definitely going away due to the overhaul that buff totems are getting. What makes the least sense is the removal of Purge, Rockbiter Weapon, and Water Breathing. I'm thinking that WB and Purge got left out by accident, not so sure about RBW. Having Lava Blast be exclusive to Elemental is also silly -- the only DPS spell a resto shaman will have in MoP (discounting all shock spells) is Lightning Bolt. :/<br />
<br />
<br />
And I have to wonder... just how will enhance shaman heal themselves in MoP when apparently we will be stuck with an ineffectual fast heal? Allow it to benefit from Shamanistic Rage? Lower the CD on Feral Spirits by 30sec? :confused:<br />

Perhaps. All I know is that I find the thought of being able to only lay down CD totems (except Searing Totem) in MoP to be very irritating. I actually find buff totems to be more interesting than some purely aura effect.

<br />
I'm sure everyone would say that about their class. Find one problem, &quot;oh it's ruined&quot;.<br />
I can name a half dozen problems with Unholy DKs alone just from this incomplete preview. No Epidemic to keep our diseases up at lower level, no reduced Death Coil cost, no Unholy Blight, no Improved Presences, no options of Butchery/Runic Power Mastery so we're more RP starved, no single-target Blood Rune dump for 7 levels after character creation, and they increased Gargoyle's cost to top it all off...<br />
But see... MoP isn't even in its beta yet. These changes aren't final, they aren't even binding. Give them feedback, they'll look into it. It's not a perfect system, but it's the best chance you have of voicing your concerns.</div></div><hr />

No it doesn't, you get 1 choice from 3 options every 15 lvls. And for hybrids, you get 3 options, one for each spec. So where's the choice? Further more, even though i know the trees aren't final, for shamans there's no dps talent AT ALL at lvl 45, they're all resto talents. Meh!<br />
<br />
P.S. With GHW and HW becoming resto spec only spells, what are the rest of the shamans going to use for self heals? If i cast Healing Surge as enhancement i'm oom in 2 casts. And the healing received is crap.</div></div><hr />

This is pre-alpha. They probably haven't even started seriously testing internally yet. This is basically just Blizzard giving us an insight into their &quot;Hey, I wonder how this would work if we put it into the game&quot;. We didn't get that with Cataclysm, so please don't even compare the changes we got there. Nobody knew specifically what was coming in Cataclysm until the beta started, at which point it was probably too late for major feedback to be considered.<br />
<br />
We're now seeing what they plan to do with classes, or things they think might work, or things they thought might work and have already realised won't. These are not PATCH NOTES. These are changes to an already-incomplete talent calculator that they've given us early so that we can see what changes from the beginning to the end. Things you think are being completely removed might just not have been added yet.<br />
<br />
I can actually see what they're doing with the warrior changes. They're removing cooldowns from abilities and making them cost a resource you can actually control your intake of. If you use that cooldown, you lose some of that resource for other things. I'm pretty sure they won't let it get to a point where you're just spamming defensive cooldowns and not using rage for anything else. If anything, they're probably taking the same philosophy with the rage cost as they usually do with new things--start out really high, then reduce it until it feels right.<br />
<br />
As for Shield Wall not requiring shields, if you look at the graphic for it at the moment it causes a wall of shields to surround you--none of which are the shield you're actually holding. You don't have more than one shield equipped, OMG WHERE DID THE OTHERS COME FROM? There's nothing nonsensical about this and protection warriors who are actually serious about tanking will be using a shield anyway.</div></div><hr />

Now is the time to actually help them understanding your point of view on the changes they already put out.And after all, you guys realy so concerned about talents and stuff? its sounds like all people is like spending hours and hours atm deciding what talents to use. its never been that way in wow, always been cookiecutter builds for everything, and will always be. Never in any game have any talent system offered diffrent choices that in the end didnt result in someone breaking it down into fragments and come up with the most optimal when it comes to damage. these changes that makes the system &quot;easier&quot; will make you spend exactly the same time in ur talent screen as before, and keep you spending 99% of ur time of the game in the raids (if ur a raider) or in pvp grounds (if ur a pvp'er).But just remember, instead of QQ like your life is over, now make a change, go into the MoP forums, explain your class change and why its bad, and how they can make it better, would save us all alot of QQ posts which is realy not needed and so booring to read.</div></div><hr />

Dude, did you even TRY out the new calc? Shamans get tons of new stuff with the new talentsystem. Healtotem may be dead (still, the changes are not in stone AND incomplete, maybe they just forgot) but you get a healing stream totem!<br />
<br />
I really like the changes till now - shaman is the best way to show - away with the useless passive buffs, only &quot;active&quot; ones remain. I already have every possible keyboardcombo with allmost all skills / totems / whatever and I use them often. In MoP we will have less skills or buttons to push, but that only because they killed the passive buffs etc.<br />

That is very questionable on their part. Panick is never good. What I like so far: Moonkins will finally seem to be doing better in pvp. I've waited too long for this! Absolutely loving the hybrid aspect of druids they are improving so much on it. DK Control undead is awesome. Warrior Bloodthirst cd increased, tired of losing in dps to a damn fury warrior! But I play one too and it seems more interesting now. What I don't like: I'm already sure that enh shammy was only gonna be my main for one expac, holy shit, no love for this spec whatsoever from blizz, after having a moonkin for a main I'm picking a spec that actually gets attention for once. (And not just attention like fixing the shitty aoe, but ramp up time, buggy totem and huge cd's on abilities that actually do damage). Not to mention the completely underwhelming talents for shammy omg. Word of Glory needs a cd for ret in pvp, they have bubble and lay on hands already fgs. Warrior tanks aoe just got worse again with revenge's cd lol, sweet lord why. Defensive cd's cost 80 rage, yikes!</div></div><hr />

For all the people crying like babies about being &quot;nerfed&quot; - this is by no means even close to finished. Look at Warlocks. You can assume that all classes will be like that, or at least close to it.<br />
<br />
Stop the crying, it's obnoxious. Nobody cares about your &quot;blizz is retarded, they nerfed the lowest dps class huungnghh QQ&quot;, so stop it.<br />
<br />
I, for one, really love these changes. I'm not silly enough to believe they're close to finished, but rather there to give us an idea about what they intended with the changes - people have been really confused with where their spells such as Living Bomb, and Deep Freeze went, and Blizzard needed to show them where they'd come from.<br />
<br />
And yes, these talents are far far far better than current. Current talents have very close to no choice whatsoever. These talents will provide at least 5 choices for all classes, and in best cases 6.<br />
They are changes that are good for everyone. Good and bad players. The bad players can get a decent spec without copying someone else, while the good players can actually think about how they should spec.</div></div><hr />

Well, try not even SEEING the talents before bitching. When I looked at the Shaman removals, I was like the others (&quot;good lord, blizz, stop listening to the &quot;me me me&quot; PvP side and nerfing everything about us&quot;). However, once I looked at the talents that they are thinking of giving us, while I still have some concerns and questions, I'm more at ease.<br />
<br />
For example, HST is not exactly going to be removed, but rePLACED by what I consider, for now at least, to be a better option as a talent at level 60. Also, looking at the other talents for the Shammy, for example, we could be an invincible healer for a bit if we need to be (and we pick the right talents). <br />
<br />
Still, I have questions about that build, and I haven't checked the others yet, but all in all, knee jerk reactions are bad, but that's something that people will ALWAYS do, no matter how many ways Blizz tries to prevent that from happening.</div></div><hr />

I guess this makes this a bad post, so I'll edit it a little. I am very happy about almost all of these changes, even this early on. I don't count things like certain spells not being there, if they're at all useful - those will be put back, trust me. I think it's looking awesome and I think it's the best thing they've done with talents since the game first came out.</div></div><hr />

Whining on this forum will never reach Blizzard. So no, it's not justified to whine here. Yes, they ask for feedback. But not &quot;omg warrior changes wtf im rerolling paladin&quot;, as that is not helpful at all. Again, whining here won't reach Blizzard, so there's no point at all of doing so. Anyone who whines here just wants attention and someone to hold their hands.</div></div><hr />

<br />
who are you to call people retards? what kind of mentality you have? am guessing a street wise one.<br />
first of all even if those changes are not final yet, that doesn't mean they don't want to hear people thoughts about them, remember even thoughts can be changed into a better one and implementing it. if no 1 gave anything criticism, and waited for the final issued changes ( proved changes ) then if something goes wrong it will be very hard to change, because most changes they don't just depend on the class it self it depends on the other classes they might effect. for example removing hand of freedom doesn't effect paladins only, it effect every class that can play with paladins effectively.<br />
<br />
so if u don't like to hear about people wine or criticism, just ignore them replays, and read HOORAY replays. which i doubt that u cant. Troll</div></div><hr />

There were changes, but what i always liked about Priest was variety of healing spells. Now half of the spells are taken away and given to one of the specs. What is the point? Do Disc and Holy seem so indistinctive? Do they have so similar play-style?When healing as Priest I used every single spell I was given (even heal and Holy nova, when needed), I loved it that i had to &quot;play the piano&quot; to be efficient and good. And now i'm gonna be taken them away?? For me it simplifies Priest healing play style a LOT. When it's simple I just cant play it, because I have problems with attention and if the game is not various or intensive enough i very quickly start feeling bored and sleepy. For me such changes will just make this game impossible to play! And it is really so because i'm a nerd Priest and 90% of the time played in WoW i spent as Priest.Why make WoW so simple? Do you want people from kindergarten to be able to play it? Or no-brainers? I feel so sorry about these changes that I even logged and left this comment. Usually I dont cause I trust Blizzard, but these Priest changes just look creepy and fatal. =(</div></div><hr />

Good Lord, stop just reading the SPELLCHANGES - take a look at the fucking calc. You get a BUNCH of totems per SKILL ...<br />
<br />
And yes, it's a good thing to actually put some spells to one class only. 1-2 healskills as ele/melee is more then enough. And the bufftotems will reapear as some kind of aura or trough some skill as passive bonus.<br />
<br />
You will have totems, but those are only totems that do something actually like the searing etc. <br />
<br />
And wait a bit . they removed purge, but I guess it will come back or won't be needed anymore (afaik they wanted to change the dispell/cc system too)<br />
<br />
As a shaman I like my totems, but I hate to drop them just to provide a buff. So I like the idea to have only active ones :D</div></div><hr />

Makes no sense.. I hope this is holy they are talking about, wtb holys 20% dmg reducion..Long Arm of the Law now lasts for 2 seconds, down from 4. yea it was OP lets nerf it...where is Avenging Wrath dispel immunity? our only way to kill something wich is dispelled in random normal bgs within 2 sec by priest, hunters, shamans, locks, or spellstolen by mages.. atleast making so we gain something after it gets dispelled instead so they think again when they dispel, say refreshes your freedom or gives youfreedom effect for say X seconds, currently it's usable for 1 hammer, and now that dmg is nerfed down to uselessness. Not only that, it does'nt matter how fastwe are, roots will still stop us until our mana runs out, but I guess that 1000 healing to allies within 10 yards would just tell us we are actually 2 hand wielding healers,and not in any position to go as any form of dps in a pvp enviroment, and from what I see from MoP talents our selfless healer will use a cast healing... If you only can imagine how frustrating it is in pvp to use pretty much all my holy power for healing and have a feeling I get carried through the whole thing, our burst is pretty much only useful against people who know nothing about pvp and other classes, but I cant imagine that's how they balance a class around?I know a few more specs has this issue, warriors and shamans, playing as holy with a warrior just feels like a release a dog and then help him to jump through the hoops...but Blizzard do not tend to classes or should I say specs to be viable, when anyone with a tiny brain can see what type of fixes they can make.None asking for OPness here, just abit survivability but hey! maybe I ask for too much, it feels like the policy is atm &quot;-play as you like, but most likley you will be frustrated becausewe have'nt attended to any of the specs that you may think suits you, play as healer and you will be fine we are too busy creating more balance issues by introducing new stuffwich we know we cant handle.&quot;Here is two jokes to the readers: Heroic Leap...and the second &quot;Retribution Aura&quot; (god im happy they removed it, it took space in my interface).</div></div><hr />

I understand it's very early but seriously, there is no talent system. It's just choose which ability you want for the fun of it and move along. I hope they add at least twice as many abilities back into the game in MoP otherwise that expansion will be the wow killer expansion instead of Cata. I know they want to remove cookie cutter specs but this just dumbed down the game to laughable levels. Welcome to Pokemon mixed with Kungfu Panda. Wow has become a 3 year olds game. <br />
<br />
I hope someone at Blizzard comes to their senses soon otherwise the only ones playing the game will be little kids. Maybe that's the market they want to focus on and if so, they've succeeded.</div></div><hr />
