Character Level Scaling<br />
Patch 5.4 added an interesting feature to the game that allows character levels to be scaled down in dungeons. It isn't normally active, but can be activated with a trick in a few different lower level dungeons. This shouldn't come as a big surprise, as the developers mentioned that this system was mostly in place in the Patch 5.4 interviews (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1345). <br />
<br />
Right now the system clearly isn't finished, as some spells cannot be cast due to your scaled character level, stats on the character frame are not consistent, pet abilities aren't scaled down properly, and your scaled level is only reflected in tooltips and not unit frames. <br />
<br />
This system might be related to a new type of instance added to the game files in Patch 5.4, &quot;Timewalker (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/october/dungeonList.png)&quot;. This isn't actually implemented officially for any instances yet, so treat it like any other datamined information until something is announced. <br />
<br />
You can see an example of scaled down gameplay and stats below, but keep in mind things aren't supposed to be balanced at all yet, and no stat squish has happened, so even though gear and level is scaled down, we still had more player power than would be intended. <br />

<br />
Connected Realms Feedback<br />
they dont connect realms to fix faction imbalance<br />
Faction balance is definitely being considered, but it is a tricky factor though, because generally the factions are not balanced within the same realm types. <br />
<br />
If we were connecting PvE realms with PvP realms, then faction balance would be much less of an issue since our PvP realms are typically Horde heavy, and our PvE realms are typically Alliance heavy. But since we have to connect realms within the same realm types, the population will be increased on the connected realms but we cannot fully balance the factions on all of those realms. <br />
<br />
That being said, the overall population situation on those realms should feel vastly improved overall once we are done with the whole process, so although the outnumbered factions in some cases will remain outnumbered, they should still see a nice boost to their numbers.<br />
<br />
Will you keep adding more realms if connected realms are still too low? <br />
Sure. As an example; Emeriss and Hakkar have been connected now, and Crushridge will be connected with those two realms next, and more realms will be connected to those three in the future.<br />
<br />
Remember, what you are seeing now is just the beginning. Plenty more connections will be made, which means that it is way to soon to proclaim doom and gloom on the few connections that have been made so far<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, once more, but You are connecting 2 COMPLETELY empty servers to emeriss. why would you connect 3 realms together while 1 has an &quot;ok&quot; amount of 90's, emeriss in this case, and 2 thats made of thin air? isn't it better to connect hakkar with emeriss and crushridge with another realm like emeriss? I don't see it fullfilling the purpose of populating the realms further, nor help the technical issues by mixing in massive amounts of realms without it changing anything.<br />
<br />
hakkar and crushridge basically contributes nothing to emeriss, but ofc, the other way around, emeriss contributes to them, But why would you attach 2 empty realms to the same one? wouldn't it be serving a much better purpose connecting those nothingness realms to one other realm?<br />
Because those three realms will be connected, the population will effectively be larger on all the three realms. Right now it might not feel like much of a population boost for the players on Emeriss, but it will already feel like a significant population boost for the players on Crushridge and Hakkar. We have just begun the realm connection process though, and more realms(yet to be announced) will be connected to Hakkar, Crushridge, and Emeriss.<br />
<br />
In short, once the entire realm connection process is complete for Emeriss and all the realms(some that are still to be announced) that Emeriss will be connected to, players on all of those realms will feel like they are playing on one single well populated realm.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned before, this is only just the beginning of the realm connection process, so it is a little too soon to declare doom and gloom <br />
<br />
after seeing that Scarshield Legions and Spooregar will be merged, isn't it better to just merge the RPPVP servers with each other? <br />
The plan is that Scarshield Legion and Sporeggar will be connected with more realms in the future, but we cannot connect all realms in one go. We have to do it in a staggered manner to make sure that realms will be connected 100% correctly without any complications. <br />
<br />
One of the reasons why we are not announcing all the planned realm connections right away is because we want to be careful with raising false expectations in case something does not go according to the plan. If we announce specific realm connections in advance, then we will naturally raise a lot of hope and expectations for the players on those realms scheduled to be connected, but if some unforeseen complications would then arise that would result in us not being able to connect some realms as planned, then we will have a lot of upset and disappointed people.<br />
<br />
Hey Vaneras i´m curious to know whats th target population for each final group of connected realms. Something like a high populated server? or Medium? <br />
I can't give you any specific numbers,<br />
<br />
But the target is high population realms with some additional capacity for new players and/or migrating players. We basically want a healthy population for the connected realms, but not so high that there will be queues from the get go.<br />
<br />
<br />
High Population Realms<br />
Our realm forums are filled with queue posts and no one is responding to any of them so STOP! pouring people into realms that already have 1-2 hour queues.<br />
We are not directing people into the high population realms—we actually warn players against creating characters there—and your feedback is not being ignored.<br />
<br />
With the specific aim of tackling this issue, we set up FCMs for every realm that has a queue. For some time now, we’ve been offering FCMs to realms with a medium population, so no one should fear being moved to a realm with hardly any other players.<br />
<br />
Also, when people opt to play on a realm which is clearly marked as “full”, they are warned that this may result in a wait to play. In fact, if there is a queue on the realm at that particular time, players should be unable to migrate characters there or create new ones (unless they have one there already to my knowledge).<br />
<br />
Currently, if players with friends or family on high population realms wish to make characters there so they can play together, they are able to do so as long as there’s no queue at that time. CRZ and the associated technology has made it possible to do many things with friends on different realms, so there should be less of a desire to move to these high pop realms, but clearly they still appeal to people. As always, we’re considering and monitoring this with the aim of improving the situation for everyone.<br />
<br />
Well but connected realms will not solve the Queue-problem. Empty Main-cities are empty main-cities. I surely will not transfer off of Stormscale or Outland just because it's free to Low Pop Servers. It just &quot;feels&quot; good to be around other players in main hubs. If Blizzard connects also cities - then really everyone can say &quot;i dont care&quot; on what server I play on. Which is just the right solution for everyone. Cross-Realm for everything.<br />
Despite us offering FCMs to medium pop servers now, many still perceive these realms as low pop, and are reluctant to move there. Once Connected Realms are in place, hopefully people will be happier to move from realms with queues to these revitalised realms with healthy populations. <br />
<br />
You know why people refuse to move? Because those so called &quot;medium&quot; population realms have 1/4th of full server populations. Take silvermoon for instance, it's alliance PVE heaven - huge population concentraded on a 1 faction. Target server might have different faction ration too which cuts the number of players by 75% or more. Number of pugs and people in general on peaktime there is less than Silvermoon has at 2 AM servertime.<br />
Yeah, we've seen feedback that people don't like moving to quiet realms after being on busy ones, which is why we changed the FCMs to realms with higher populations. Having said that, even those realms will seem quiet after being on one like Outland for example, and I understand the reluctance. We have to be careful which realms we send people to though. If we offer FCMs to a realm with a nice healthy population, we risk creating queues there too.<br />
<br />
Faction balance is a different matter, but we always try to help with that when creating the FCMs. In reality though, people on a realm where their faction is dominant will be hesitant to move to a realm where it's no longer the case. If we offer FCMs to people who are in the minority faction, those few remaining players may abandon the realm and make matters worse.<br />
<br />
It's natural, especially on PvP realms, that people will gravitate towards realms that favour their faction, and over time the size difference grows. Blocking certain character transfers or character creations to tackle this isn't really ideal for those who want to play alongside friends. <br />
<br />
i also suspect theses Qs are artificially created as they did not exist in 5.3 or 5.2 on silvermoon <br />
No. The queues are purely from the number of people logging into the realm. They have not been &quot;falsely created&quot; in any way so please put away the tin foil hats. The only thing that impacts realm queue times is the number of people that wish to play on a certain realm at a certain time.<br />
<br />
We're at an interesting time right now, what with Connected Realms being implemented. Populations are bound to be in flux while realms are connected. As I mentioned earlier, when all realms have a healthy population we're hoping FCMs will have a much larger appeal, but either way we can better analyse the situation when the dust starts to settle. <br />
<br />
why must i PAY to move my guilds?<br />
It's simply not built into the FCM automated system. That's something that is still being considered though, it's also a matter of resources and priorities, as always.<br />

the lack of future information is making WoW boring for me. I have nothing to be excited about. Any new news soon?<br />
We often talk about WoW at Blizzcon. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384833552367357952))<br />
<br />
Even though there's a lot to do, the lack of clear direction gets me logging in less. Hopefully a balance in the future!<br />
We agree that the lack of direction, especially when new patches come out, is a big problem. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384842688840740864))<br />
<br />
why dont you let us the players decide what we feel is unfun?<br />
A good question, and there are a few reasons. A) Players don't agree on what is fun. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384853061610373120))<br />
B) There is no efficient way to communicate that information to us. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384853114169225220))<br />
Then how about providing us a means to communicate properly &amp; efficiently to you folks?<br />
Players have a tendency to write really long forum posts, which makes it even harder to extract useful feedback. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385138316552585218))<br />
C) Players aren't always great at predicting what changes they will like or not. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384853389546229760))<br />
A common sentiment in game design is that players know what they like, but not always why. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384853486279467008))<br />
Those maxims sound more condescending than intended. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384853825292492800))<br />
Their aim is really to discourage designers from getting into the mode of trying to please everyone too much. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384853917051273216))<br />
Another is that players are great at detecting problems and much worse at suggesting solutions. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384853606253350914))<br />
so why are most replies to the people who complain with no solution rather than only those with ideas?<br />
It's difficult to give someone who put a lot of effort into their pitch a reasonable critique, esp. given the volume we get. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385140971886764032))<br />
On the other hand, it takes no time to try and discourage complainers and makes my twitter feed easier to read in the long run. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385141087670525952))<br />
<br />
Why is a vanity pet called a companion while a combat pet is called simply a pet? It should be the other way around! <br />
We discussed that, but the word &quot;pet&quot; meant too many different things and we were reluctant to attempt to redefine too much. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384843852051267584))<br />
<br />
Why all the hush hush about VRealms, yo? Want my realm connected!<br />
We're not trying to keep it hushed. We're just rolling it out cautiously to make sure it's a good, stable experience. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/388430965334212608))<br />

Is balance based on topguilds only?Bcs this OP wlock dmg from no t16 2/4piece, me not being is non existent = /<br />
We strive for balance at a variety of skill and item levels because we have players at a variety of levels. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/387967055460179969))</div></div><hr />

You.....I like you. Maybe WoW keeps people coming in and coming back because they are capable of quickly and successfully (mostly) improving/changing their game to make it interesting? No MMOs EVER use somebody else's successful ideas.....that would be wrong.</div></div><hr />

I'd actually like to go back and do some TBC heroics, I wonder if people would ignore Oculus again for wotlk haha.<br />

Of course they would have to make it optional or they'd fuck over the entire soloing community which is massive now thanks to transmog.<br />
<br />
The blue mentions Outland, I'm on Outland, Outland Queues are ridiculous, I'm pretty sure it's THE highest EU population or very close, right now I've been in the queue for half an hour at 8:30 Sunday and I've got 405 people in front still, I'd love to transfer somewhere smaller, but my friends won't, so neither will I, that's also a big problem with free transfers, it's usually not just one persons choice.<br />

Edit: Aslong as time walker isn't the theme of the next expansion, I'm kind of sick of the caverns of time now and the like, it can't be over used, it doesn't feel progressive enough as it's in the past, but being a feature of the next expansion? Sure, fire ahead :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you would read the post, it is a new INSTANCE TYPE. Meaning, if you do what you do to farm transmog and mounts today, you're not activating the new instance type.<br />
<br />
Think of it like Normal vs. Heroic. If you enter a Heroic dungeon, the only thing similar between Normal and Heroic are the mob names. The abilities can change, health and damage changes, everything. Timewalker dungeons would be like a version of old instances where instead of MOBS being scaled UP, your GEAR is scaled DOWN.<br />
<br />
In no way, shape, or form would this affect farming.</div></div><hr />

Forgive my frustration, but the fact is, I've BEEN waiting patiently. Yet, realm list after realm list shows realms with populations higher than mine being connected while we get ignored.

Given the mass of replies in that thread about the feature and not one of them (for as far as I'd read the thread when it appeared) stating that it had already been found, it seems quite likely this is the original finder, he explains how to repeat the process and then everyone else goes and tries it.</div></div><hr />

It obviously won't be the same as the first time I did it, too many things have changed to make it feel like the first time. But if scaled CORRECTLY, it could be a fun time filler.</div></div><hr />

Taking features that work from other games and adapting them to your own isn't something new. It's called having enough market awareness to know what their clients want or like.<br />

<br />
This would actually be a terrible idea.<br />
<br />
Sure, it sounds fun at first. But then you realize that your BiS weapon drops off Deathwing and you need a trinket from the Black Temple and gloves from ICC and a helm off Onyxia, etc, and suddenly you &quot;have&quot; to run ten raids a week to gear up. (And if you don't you'll have That Guy whining that by not pugging into ten scaled raids a week you're being disrespectful to your raid group because you could theoretically be doing x% more damage with your BiS items....)<br />
<br />
I think a better idea, if you want these scaled raids to drop current loot, is to make a pool of Timeless raid gear (not to be confused with Timeless Isle token epics) and assign each boss three or four slots; all gear is otherwise shared between any scaled boss. For example, if you're after a weapon you might know that all end bosses drop Timeless raid weapons, but it doesn't matter which raid you do because they all drop weapons drawn from the same pool. The item level would probably be best placed to about the same level as flex gear, but increase with each new tier (since you can't outgear the raids.) You get valor for boss kills and x personal loot rolls a week (one roll per unique boss per week) with the same 25% success rate (and failure protection?) as current tier coin rolls. (If you could roll on every boss, you would doubtlessly get people who feel like they have to run every raid in the game every week like they did with 5.0 dailies to keep up on gearing-- you can if you want to for fun, of course, but you'd stop getting drops before long.)<br />
<br />
Of course, my concern here is that people would calculate the most efficient raid (TOC is my gut feeling) and ONLY run that for their scaled raid loot, which would sort of defeat the purpose of offering every raid in the game to the players...</div></div><hr />

Instead, have scaled raids drop &quot;Burdens of Eternity&quot; and Timeless random loot tokens. With the right combination of random stats, that gear can be very powerful. But your chances of getting it are low.<br />
<br />
This means it's worthwhile to run scaled dungeons for empty slots, but &quot;Named Gear&quot; from current teir raids are still BiS. Also makes easier scaled raids good for alts, since you don't often aim for BiS, just Good Enough or even Something At All. It also means ALL old raid bosses can draw from a single pool and you can have a mixed-level raid group.</div></div><hr />

Right now the downscaling in challenge modes and proving grounds is downright broken for some classes, because of how things work, for example a Fury Warrior getting his crit removed is making him completely useless. Could easily be fixed if they would make STR the main stat for warriors as opposed to secondary stats, then they can downscale all the hell they want, same goes for other classes too. INT, STR, AGI, STA, main stats, which classes should be based around and secondary stats just modify your performance, and not make you useless if you don't have enough of them. And Spirit should go back to being a main stat.</div></div><hr />

I guess he is talking more about the impossibility to recreate an old moment with perfection than if it was good or bad. Like downscaling your character to vanilla level, but with current talents, secondary stats (that you need for your spec to not be useless like crit or even stats that only show up after a certain lvl like mastery), etc. all balanced around with lvl 90 and mop ilvl gear in mind.<br />

<br />
The amount of people who don't read how to activate this feature is beyond astounding...<br />
<br />
HERE IS HOW IT WORKS RIGHT NOW, AND LIKELY HOW IT WILL WORK WHEN IT IS IMPLEMENTED:<br />
<br />
Walking to the dungeon does NOT scale you down. Farmers will not in any way be affected by this. REPEAT: FARMING NOT AFFECTED. WALKING TO INSTANCE IS NOT GOING TO SCALE YOU DOWN.<br />
Look at the current LFD screen. If you look at the Dungeon Finder section, you'll notice a drop down. You can choose from Normal dungeons, Heroic dungeons, Specific dungeons. (and for the next week or so, the Headless Horseman.) Replace the Headless Horseman with &quot;Timewalker&quot; dungeons.<br />
<br />
THAT IS HOW IT WILL LIKELY WORK. That option is not available right now because Blizzard is still working out the kinks in the implementation, such as high level spells not working due to scaling issues. But again, scaling will not be forced in normal versions of the dungeons! ONLY in the Timewalker versions! Farming, normals, heroics, etc. will NOT BE AFFECTED BY THE NEW IMPLEMENTATION.</div></div><hr />

There was a time a few months back when this was all over the forums here. People were going crazy over speculating what it could possibly be. Since 5.4's launch, however, the topic seems to have vanished completely from interest. We were assured it would relate to old content, so I'm thinking this Timewalker business was probably the feature in question, but it wasn't released for some reason. I also remember them back-tracking and attempting to tranquilize the excitement the &quot;unannounced feature&quot; caused; I wonder if it's because it wasn't even going to be ready for the patch and they knew it. One could guess the Timewalker type instance was that feature.<br />
<br />
It's 100% the unannounced feature that the dumbass hyped. And then when he was told it would be delayed and that he had to go onto his twitter and eat crow he decided to come up with that BS line about how you can believe whatever your heart wants to believe it was, you just have to close your eyes and have faith. He flat out lied to us and it worked. There is a reason they say things like, &quot;We can't completely separate pvp from pve and have all your spells do two different things depending on where you are because the player base is dumb and would get too confused&quot;. They know exactly how retarded we all are, cause we fall for crap like the unannounced feature debacle. He should have had to face the music for hyping up a feature that wasn't 100% ready to go, but he did a little misdirect and like dumb mobs in the game we fell for it.<br />

Yeah Rift is awesome with that. A problem I have in WoW is if I'm leveling with someone and they're not online I'm not allowed to play my toon. I have to sit there and wait for them. In Rift, I can continue to level and gain say 8 levels, then my friend logs in and he's level 34 but now I'm level 42 but I just right click my portrait and set my level back to 34. Now I can quest and do dungeons with him AND I still get the same xp so I'm still leveling. It's awesome.<br />

Because they lost an insane amount of people when they gutted the talent tree at the start of Mop. Blizzard themselves have said the major reason people put in the box when they quit is &quot;too many changes&quot;. You think the casual players aren't going to freak when they log in and find themselves only hitting for 200 dps? It doesn't matter that they are killing the mob at the same rate, they will feel weaker and freak out, hit the cancel sub button and list &quot;too many changes&quot;. I'm one of those watch the world burn types so I'm actually looking forward to the shit hawks coming. They're coming Bubbles!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, not squishing will break WoW. Literally. They're not doing this for the fun of it, they're doing this because we're close to the point where the engine just won't be able to handle the numbers they have to feed into it.<br />
<br />
WoW was designed before 64 bit applications were possible, and even though it has a 64 bit version now, the important big numbers are 32 bit integers. For example, we know that boss HP is a 32 bit integer and therefore capped at 2,147,483,647 HP because Heroic Lei Shen can break if his HP gets that high. (This involves doing the encounter very, very wrong.) Garrosh has about 1.5 billion health between the two phases on 25 man normal, and most of the other SoO bosses have over a billion health. In Dragon Soul, Ultraixion, the highest HP single boss in the instance, had 180 million HP, and Deathwing had 412m between the wings, arms, and head. In other words, at that rate we can expect the final boss of next tier to have 4.5 billion health, not counting any adds.<br />
<br />
Unless they make every fight a phased fight where the boss' health refills between phases or a council fight, they can do one of two things: they can squish, or they can rewrite the engine to accept larger HP numbers (and, in the process, kill the 32 bit client and force everyone to go 64 bit. 64 bit is a relatively new thing, so older computers can't un a 64 bit application and some users will be left in the dust.) Seeing how weird some of the past bugs have been (anyone remember when disabling vengeance gains off pets in PvP made paladins have ridiculously high damage for a few hours?) can you blame them for not wanting to rewrite a core part of their engine?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been thinking about such a feature, I called it myself the Legacy Difficulty, it would allow you to revisit old content by scaling down your gear and stats and earn achievements only possible there, mounts and stuff. The idea of revisiting such places with people actually leveling there hadn't cross my mind though. I just wish that doing so would also allow you to use the drops of these zones as actual upgrades over your downscaled gear, and make those old legendaries worth again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard will try to make it look like there are ppl around with the new invite a friend system. But the fact is that most of those ppl are not new players... but ppl that are only buying extra copy of the game.

Except when Blizzard does it, they do it with a dev team that's actually familiar with their engine and systems and do it right... and not with a dev team that gets culled each time the profit margins don't meet expectations and have to shut down entire studio locations and jam their in-game store with more Lottery boxes full of relic-quality gear and reused-model mounts.<br />

Look up a term called &quot;power creep&quot;. Four expansions have happened since Blackrock Spire, all that improved character balance and in doing such, character power.

<br />
With the cashflow they have at Blizzard, they better be going and re-write the engine. I see it being needed due to the way the game code works, but that's not the customers problem, and re-coding is what the programmers are there paid for, they can easily hire additional staff if needed, a programmer is a programmer either good or bad, it's not like with artists and visionaries. <br />
<br />
I still have the PC I had when WoW was released (fathers using it as an email terminal) and todays WoW runs like shit on it, where when wow was released it run relatively fine. So really, who plays wow on a 2004-2006 PC, I bet a total of 1000 people, which all need to buy a new PC regardless. And if your PC is relatively new 2004 and onwards you can run a 64bit OS, and whoever buys a new PC today with 32bit OS preinstalled or even decides himself to install 32bit, needs to be publicly humiliated. <br />
<br />
There is no reason not to switch to 64bit.</div></div><hr />
