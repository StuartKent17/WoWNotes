Haven’t yet ventured beyond the Dark Portal? Beginning today, June 28, players will be able to get both the original World of Warcraft and the game’s first expansion set, The Burning Crusade, for only $19.99 as part of the new digital Battle Chest now available in the online Blizzard Store.<br />
<br />
In addition, anyone who owns the original World of Warcraft, regardless of when they purchased the game, will automatically be able to access all of the content and features from The Burning Crusade expansion at no additional cost. It’s time to set forth from Azeroth, adventurer -- Outland awaits! <br />
<br />
Also, the trial accounts are no longer limited in time and players can spend an unlimited amount of time on them. The level cap (20) and other restrictions still applies.<br />
The restrictions should still all be in place. Trial accounts simply no longer expire. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/182918/blizzards-new-lvl-20-forever-free-trials) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2743804562?page=1#2))<br />

Patch 4.2 - Hands/Feet Epic Crafted Items confirmed to drop from Firelands Raid Trash<br />
People started farming trash in the new Firelands Raid instance to increase their reputation with the Avengers of Hyjal (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2338-Druid-Fire-Cat-Form-Avengers-of-Hyjal-Valor-Points-Rewards-Setup-of-the-Month#avengers) and got a couple of new recipes out of it! We can assume that the following recipes all drop from Firelands Raid trash. <br />
<br />
For all the crafted items added in Patch 4.2, check out the Patch 4.2 - Crafted Items (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2353-Patch-4.2-Crafted-Items-Frostscythe-Stats-Distribution-Comics) article.<br />

Honor Points Capped at 4000<br />
During maintenance the change that was intended to be applied for the start of Season 10 next week, which was to cap Honor Points at 4000 and convert any points above the cap to gold, was inadvertently applied early. This means that everyone who would have down-converted Conquest to Honor over the 4000 cap had those additional points converted to gold at a rate of 35 silver per point and sent to them via in-game mail.<br />
<br />
We’re still researching what steps led to the error, but unfortunately due to the nature of the currency conversion that took place, we’ll be unable to reverse the change, remove the delivered gold, or reinstate the surplus Honor Points.<br />
<br />
We apologize greatly for this error.<br />

Blizzard Insider #39 -- Art of the Firelands<br />
With Rage of the Firelands (patch 4.2), Ragnaros the Firelord returns with a burning vengeance to challenge players on his home turf, the elemental realm of twisting flames and churning magma. <br />
<br />
To get a behind-the-scenes look at the creation of Ragnaros's domain, the Insider recently sat down with Jonathan Dumont (lead level designer) and Gary Platner (lead environment artist) from the World of Warcraft team to discuss the creative process and art philosophy behind the game’s newest 10- and 25-player raid instance and accompanying quest hub. So read on, and learn how the Firelands evolved from rough concept art to a fully fleshed-out in-game environment.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/june/firelandsart1_small.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/june/firelandsart1.jpg)<br />
<br />
Where did the ideas and initial concepts for the Firelands come from? <br />
<br />
Jonathan: We knew early on that we wanted the Firelands to feel alien and formidable, a place of infinite height and size, and not just an ordinary volcanic cave with lava. We liked the outer-dimensional aspect of it and focused on ideas that involved a lot of floating islands and magma falls. It needed to feel epic and dangerous and, most importantly, like somewhere our players would enjoy exploring. So once we had our initial ideas together, one of our level designers, Victor Chong, created a quick block-out of the geometry, and it triggered a new flood of ideas and concept art from the art team that got us going from there.<br />
<br />
Gary: True, though it doesn’t always happen that way. Sometimes an artist will create a concept first, and then an exterior level designer will create a rough mock-up from that. Other times a designer will first create a rough map in Illustrator before it goes to a level designer for further development. No matter who starts the process, there’s always a lot of back and forth between level designers, encounter designers, concept artists, and environment artists to make sure we’re working with the most epic — and feasible — ideas. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/june/firelandsart2_small.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/june/firelandsart2.jpg)<br />
<br />
How did you focus on the ideas that eventually made it into the final version of the zone? Are there any visual elements that did not make the cut? <br />
<br />
Gary: A lot of times we don’t know how something will work out until we go ahead and give it a try. One of the early visual concepts we tried for the zone were these octagonal rock columns, which you can find here on Earth in areas with a lot of volcanic activity. You see them in places like the Devils Postpile in California or the Giant’s Causeway in Ireland. These rock columns worked great for the spider area in the Firelands, especially after an artist painted them with glowing fiery web textures. One idea we tried that didn’t make the cut were fire columns shaped like trees. We have trees in most outdoor zones, so we thought we’d add tree-like flames to the Firelands, but tree shapes -- even burning tree shapes -- ultimately felt out of place. <br />
<br />
Jonathan: Also, we initially wanted to make the Firelands a lot busier by adding lots of floating islands above the main island and having all these crazy lava waterfalls pouring across the playable area. We still did some of that, but we scaled that idea way back because it was making the zone visually confusing. We also tried having a boundless lava ocean under the main island, but that ended up creating a horizon line and taking away from the sense of infinity that we were trying to achieve, so we cut it. It makes the Firelands feel a lot bigger when you walk up to the edge of the main island, look down, and see nothing but swirling clouds of ash below. <br />

<br />
What visual challenges did the Firelands present when the World of Warcraft artists began building the zone? <br />
<br />
Jonathan: The main thing we had to keep in mind was that the instance is just the stage and ultimately the players are going to provide the action. So in addition to everything we put into the zone, there are also going to be players, monsters, pets, and all their spell effects going off during the raid. We didn’t want the action to be overwhelmed by bursting fires and lava explosions, but at the same time, it’s the Firelands, so you definitely need some of that! Finding a visual balance between the spectacular and the practical was a challenge. <br />
<br />
Gary: As an outdoor instance, the Firelands is actually the work of two different art teams. The dungeon team works on the enclosed interior areas of the instance, such as Sulfuron Keep, and the environment team works on the exterior terrain areas, such as the Molten Fields. Making seamless transitions between both types of geometry was a fairly challenging undertaking. We had some help from our new texture-blending technology that was implemented with Cataclysm, but there were still a few rough edges to smooth out. One of our early bugs that we had to resolve was that the skybox was showing through the walls of the interior areas. You could see the sky through the ashen haze, even though you were inside Sulfuron Keep!<br />

<br />
How did the encounters designers, animators, and environment artists work together to bring the Firelands and its raid encounters to life?<br />
<br />
Jonathan: Well, I don’t want to risk spoiling any of the boss encounters… but I will say that the encounter designers had some really interesting ideas on how to make some of the areas much more interactive. We all thought the boss encounters were distinct and epic to begin with, so it wasn’t hard to create supporting areas for them. The Shatterstone area in particular features a volcano boss and full set piece designed by the dungeon art team that also includes animation and terrain work. It’s a great example of all of the game-development disciplines working together to create a memorable encounter. <br />
<br />
How do you bring the raid instance to life?<br />
<br />
Gary: The terrain doesn’t actually animate, so we had to create a sense of molten lava using particle effects and props. The lava was created with the game’s improved liquid technology… the same liquid tech we used for the new water effects in Cataclysm. We were able to create heat-shimmer effects with animated props and we added a lot of particle flames and fire spouts throughout the Firelands.<br />
<br />
How did you tie all of the Firelands’ different visual elements and points of interest together?<br />
<br />
Jonathan: Players may not consciously notice this, but we framed the whole exterior portion of the raid zone around Sulfuron Keep and tried to make it visible throughout as much of the zone as possible. This gives players a constant visual point of reference on the horizon, and also gives them a subtle reminder of where they are ultimately headed as they progress through the raid instance. For Sulfuron Keep itself, the dungeon art team created an awesome-looking building with a distinct profile, and we used it as a backdrop for a lot of the other areas as well. We also wanted to create unique areas for the boss encounters, while still making sure that they all felt like they belonged in the domain of fire in the elemental plane. The Lair of Beth’tilac [the Red Widow] serves as a good example of how the design and art teams embraced the fiery hot visual themes, while still making a unique and memorable point of interest for the boss. <br />
<br />

<br />
Can you tell us about the new boss models? How was Ragnaros visually updated for Rage of the Firelands?<br />
<br />
Gary: Ragnaros’s model was completely rebuilt from scratch. Ragnaros was given a new hammer, new armor, and best of all, legs! <br />
<br />
Jonathan: Yup, this is the first time players get to see Ragnaros on his home turf, so we wanted to make him look even bigger, stronger, and tougher than before. He is now much closer to his seat of power and we needed to convey that through his model. There are many other bosses in the instance as well, and we wanted to get away from filling a zone with just elementals. So you can expect to see a lot of variety in the Firelands.<br />

<br />
Thanks for your time. Anything else you’d like to share before you go?<br />
<br />
Jonathan: I hope players enjoy the Firelands raid and the Molten Front quest hub. We had a lot of fun making them!<br />
<br />
Gary: Yeah, creating the Firelands was a great experience. I think we’ve learned that we get good results when we break with convention and just start running with all our crazy visual concepts. It’s a trend we hope to continue in the future.<br />

[b]Why are tokens still required for Tier 11?<br />
You should still be raiding and killing bosses to progress. We don't want to make heroics the place to just grind out full sets. Considering the nerfs to normal modes, along with snagging the few pieces of T11 (and other 359's) with Justice, we fully expect that tier to be puggable.

People already in the Molten Front<br />
They're likely on the Thrall quest line, which you can pick up from the Hero's Call Boards in any capital city.<br />
<br />
You'll advance through the Hyjal dailies to the next step once you've build up 20 Marks of the World Tree (you should have a quest still asking for them), which will take a couple more days of the dailies.<br />
<br />
I also need to double check but I believe the dailies are randomized even for the first few, so tomorrow you should have a different set to complete.

Does RAF to level 80 make leveling too easy?<br />
Imagine a fully heirloomed character in a level 25 guild having this. You're nearly killing the leveling system that you worked to improve on with people that have this.<br />
Yes, imagine it. A fully heirloomed character in a level 25 guild has probably seen the leveling experience, a few times. We improved 1-60 for new players, people who haven't played the game or just didn't enjoy the original leveling quests. It wasn't to make people with four 85's slow down to get another alt up. Why should we make them go slower? Getting peoples alts up to max level quicker is what the vast majority of players want.<br />
<br />
If you don't, don't use RAF, don't use heirlooms, etc. But if you do, we like that there are ways to help you get there quicker. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/182991/raf-to-80-is-pretty-lame) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2721383404?page=1#9))<br />

Haunted Memento no longer throwable<br />
The change we made was to make the item no longer throwable. This was done to fix an exploit where players were throwing the item to transfer wealth across realms. It can be quite valuable. We decided that Haunted Memento was old enough and valuable enough that preventing it from being thrown was a reasonable compromise.

Unlimited Trial accounts: Just there so that people who wanted to give the game a second chance don't need to make a new account.<br />
Free BC: I assume this is not an optional upgrade. Which means we can finally get rid of those level 60 twinks in AV.</div></div><hr />

Doubt anyone on a lvl 20 free account can twink at 19 when theres a 10g limit, plus skill cap of 100. <br />
<br />
Having TBC wont force lvl 60 twinks to lvl up either, since you can easily pay 10g to turn off exp gains no matter the lvl.</div></div><hr />

Yes you can. Blizzard is realisng that selling a game + expansions for 100$ does not work any more. Mostly because RIFT has been the go to game for new MMO gamers in the past few months.

<br />
Thank you for that. I also understand how frustrating it is to have a guild disbanded at all. When I said it was a stupid rule, I meant that if I put the time and energy into creating a guild (coming up with a good name is hard enough, imo) and getting it to that level, who cares my reason for disbanding it! It is (or after today was) mine. <br />
<br />
I see it on the same level as I roll a new toon and get it above level 20, heck even to 85, and I decide to delete it. I don't have to provide a reason, but now blizzard says that I can't delete that toon, that I need to give it to someone else to play it. I understand the whole &quot;it affects other players&quot; vein on this discussion, it is just my viewpoint.</div></div><hr />

Uhmm how does this change anything regarding that issue? If you /disbanded a guild, you could not sell it anyway. (Duh)<br />
Now you just need to promote someone to GM and sell the guild like that. Or am I failing to see something here?</div></div><hr />

actually i quit wow about 4 months back and went over to rift, then took a 2 week break due to personal reasons, and now am back to wow.<br />
in rift, if you level with friends at about the same rate, you will have enormous amounts of fun, but you fall behind by 10 levels and then you get your ass kicked by same level mobs, killing you and the fun. <br />
IMHO Rift is all about the social aspect of MMO, none of the solo crap you can get away with in WoW. Then again, the solo crap in WoW winds up much more fun than the solo crap in RIFT.<br />
<br />
TL:DR 1.) i ramble 2.) im back to wow because of a lack of FUN solo play in RIFT</div></div><hr />

So played endless trial account is not an acctive account ? Account that is created with free refer a friend key and played for 1 month is not an active account? Who are you trying to fool? Blizzard is trying to put a positive spin on things atm. These changes to endless trials and huge amount of key giveaways gives Blizzard a perfect tool to change their defenation of active accounts. Im not saying they will be saying the game now has 30 million actvie accounts - Just saying they will put a positive spin to it cause more news of hundred of thousands players leaving does alot of dmg for both players and investors.<br />
<br />
We can only hope Bizzard will improve in their next few content patches - cause after all thats the only way they will really maintain a steady sub numbers. 4.1 was a joke of a content patch. 4.2 is a summer patch with minimum raiding content. Whats next ? Noone knows but since most BLizz devs are going for summer vacations in the next 2 months we can be pretty sure that it will not be coming out any time soon.</div></div><hr />

Last time I checked they cannot receive mail, buy items off the AH, or trade items with players. I guess you could do runs and make sure they get the drops but that is a lot of effort for a character who can do so little.<br />

Since blizzard created their own definition of what they consider an account, I wouldn't be surprised at all to find out they do count them.<br />
It's a perfect way to pad numbers and announce increased subs when in all actuality subs vs cancellations stayed the same or went down as they have recently announced.<br />
<br />
It's a move big businesses do all the time.<br />
<br />
So yea, I think blizzard will work those numbers in somehow through some fancy verbal jargon on what they consider an account.</div></div><hr />

Sure. They dream about times then you will be not allowed to delete and even quit playing your toon! Idealy LogOut and Exit buttons will be removed and your biological body will be directly connected to network.<br />

<br />
I see it as a good thing. I have friends who have wanted to try the game out, but only have 1-2days a week to try it. So people who are saying &quot;14 days is enough&quot; only works if people can be ON for those 14 days.<br />
So the unlimited trial is a good way to have some time to try it out, and if any of them want to upgrade, I have the free version for them to get up to Burning Crusade. Meaning their cost in the long run will be Wrath + Cata and the monthly sub. :)</div></div><hr />

Sounds like great changes, however I have my own personal reservation with the free Burning Crusade.<br />
<br />
I liked the fact that if you didn't own TBC it was possible to stay level 60, but PVP with the &quot;main&quot; battle group, without having to wait days for a PVP battleground.<br />
<br />
<br />
I wonder if Blizzard would still remove keys from accounts like they do, or if all TBC exclusive content is just unlocked from requiring a key, meaning having a vanilla WoW key means you have TBC. I hope its the former otherwise I won't be returning to WoW when I feel the urge to PVP at 60 again!</div></div><hr />

It's the only reason to even play WoW. Everything else is just done and done, nothing new. At least when you roll on a new server you get to meet new people. Just a pain to level without heirlooms, especially if you've spent a lot of time obtaining every heirloom you can have...</div></div><hr />

Blizz was quick to dumb the game down , give everyone epics, sell ingame items, transfer in all kind of ways possible, your realm and your experience didnt matter anymore, if you paid you felt like a sucker for doing so. Investing in content and making the game better instead of dumbing the game down and making the game fun for current players was neglected, they chose the short rewarding way of doing business, the corperat way of doing busuness, lots of profit in a short time but forgot they would actually lose money in the long term. you got what you deserve blizzard, its a shame how you went from a company who would vow for your quality went to a company that no one trusts anymore. Enjoy yhe money if you are in charge at blizzard, everyone else got fucked over in any perspective.</div></div><hr />

in rift, if you level with friends at about the same rate, you will have enormous amounts of fun, but you fall behind by 10 levels and then you get your ass kicked by same level mobs, killing you and the fun. <br />
IMHO Rift is all about the social aspect of MMO, none of the solo crap you can get away with in WoW. Then again, the solo crap in WoW winds up much more fun than the solo crap in RIFT.<br />
<br />
TL:DR 1.) i ramble 2.) im back to wow because of a lack of FUN solo play in RIFT<br />
<br />
i did the same, <br />
<br />
i started rift to play with some friends and loved it, but they were logging on for an hour and afk for most of it <br />
<br />
i hated getting killed by three or four pats and tbh, a grind is a grind</div></div><hr />

The people who make MMO juggernaut World of Warcraft have another massively multiplayer online game in the works, a game they're calling Titan for now. Blizzard calls it (http://kotaku.com/5779880/blizzards-next-mmo-is-a-total-ball-to-play-follows-diablo-iii) &quot;awesome&quot; and &quot;ambitious.&quot; One analyst calls it &quot;casual.&quot; That analyst would be Stern Agee's Arvind Bhatia, who writes that Blizzard Entertainment's next products are &quot;expansion packs for Starcraft and World of Warcraft, a new Diablo game, [and] a new casual MMO&quot; that are &quot;likely be released in the next 12 to 24 months.&quot; Bhatia clarified with Gamasutra (http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35517/Analyst_Sees_Encouraging_Diversification_At_Activision_Blizzard.php) that the &quot;casual MMO&quot; he was referring to was, indeed, Titan.<br />
<br />
With World of Warcraft appearing to have reached its player-base cap (http://kotaku.com/5800175/world-of-warcraft-suffers-post+cataclysmic-drop-in-subscriptions) and Activision more reliant on Call of Duty to be a success, a newer broader market for Titan would make sense—even if we don't know just how &quot;casual&quot; this game is expected to be.<br />
And with more games pursuing a free-to-play model, how will that jibe with Blizzard's supposed casual-leaning MMO development plans?</div></div><hr />

What's this sound I hear? Desperation? They better bring Titan out fast.</div></div><hr />
