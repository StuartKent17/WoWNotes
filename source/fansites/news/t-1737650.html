Blackrock Foundry Item Level Increase Effects<br />
Our friends at AskMrRobot have updated their site with the item level changes and done the math (http://blog.askmrrobot.com/2015/03/brf-item-level-increase/) to figure out how much the item level increase will help you. You can load your character (http://www.askmrrobot.com/wow/player) and see your new item level. <br />
<br />
If you uploaded combat logs or want to guess your percentile ranking, you can use the boss level DPS benchmarks (http://www.askmrrobot.com/wow/combatlog/stats/dps/heroic/gruul#per=95,ilvl=675) to see how much DPS on each boss you can expect to gain from your new item level. You can also use the Wipe Rate graphs (http://www.askmrrobot.com/wow/combatlog/stats/kill-rate/heroic/blackhand#) to see how much an item level increase should help your raid. <br />

Armory Stats - Patch 6.1 Class Representation<br />
Now is a good time to take a look at class representation once again. Our last look (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4556-Armory-Stats-Mists-of-Pandaria-Proving-Grounds-Blue-Tweets-Blizzard-Art) was a at the end of Mists of Pandaria.<br />
<br />
This sample includes 6.1 million characters for all item levels, 3.9 million for 630+, 2.2 million for 645+, 1.2 million for 655+, 663k for 665+, 321k for 675+, and 32k for 685+. Keep in mind that the higher the item level, the smaller the sample size, which means a less than perfect reflection of the actual class balance at that item level range.<br />

I see you fixed Arcane Power resetting with raid encounters..can we get the same for Ascendance ( and maybe even spirit wolves<br />
Feral Spirits only has a 2 min c/d so intentionally doesn’t reset. Ascendance does for Ele/Resto but not for Enh; fix incoming! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/573279046097756160))<br />
What about Shadowfiend?<br />
Shadowfiend already resets cooldown on encounter end. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/573556710834503680))<br />
Never noticed. Since when?<br />
The cutoff was &gt;3min prior to 6.1. In 6.1, we changed it to &gt;=3min. So, 6.1. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/573559978021163009))<br />

whatever happened to the visual indicator for Halo that I heard about for 6.1?<br />
It's for Holy and Discipline only since they have a cast time. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/573990051077484544))<br />

Any chance of adding further clarity to Destruction Warlock tooltips to distinguish between partial/full Burning Ember usage?<br />
We recognize how confusing Burning Ember measurements can be &amp; keeping that in mind for future revisions. Appreciate the feedback! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/573990419857477632))<br />

Where have all the crystals and stuff gone from the Shadowmoon Sash? D: http://t.co/Ur6vECCFLt<br />

Character / Items<br />
Winged Hourglass(680) vs Ironspike Chew Toy(680) has -54 int and -200 less spirit proc. Even 665 Chew Toy is better. Intended?<br />
PPM vs. fixed % chance. We’re avoiding that kind of distinction/direct comparability moving forward to lessen the confusion. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/573988983526436864))<br />

PvE<br />
Can you add a CD reset mechanic for dummies after you leave combat with them? Would make practicing openers less tedious.<br />
No immediate plans just yet, but we are considering improvements to dummy fights for the future! Thank you for the suggestion. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/573989414264659968))<br />

What happened to Illusion: Holy Infusion? I'm sure it was part of 6.1 PTR but it seems like it's not part of the live build...<br />
There was a last-minute complication that prevented us from being able to hotfix it. We're still working on it, though! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/573986041121542144))<br />

and who said he isn't? He is still alive. Has it been officially announced that he isn't?<br />

Misc<br />
Randomness does not equal repeatability. 100% agree. I find randomness to often be an area where designers have more fun than players. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/573283049766453248))<br />
It's a great tool, but it's rarely a solution on its own. I'm as guilty as any on that one. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/573283311872679936))<br />
So you mean like Guardians/Mages? Or that MS and Crit and procs are a horrible system?<br />
I'm speaking mostly from a content perspective. I'm not aiming it at combat systems personally. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/573303535686713344))<br />
This is how I feel about dungeon crawlers. But then, it works for some people. To me obvious randomness = disposable = pointless<br />
I find a similar response at times. Well-disguised randomness adds intrigue, but obvious randomness can be quickly tedious. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/573302701146030080))<br />
<br />
From yesterday: Occupying human thought with mechanics leaves less room to process emotional response. Seemingly simple, but very wise. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/573585512205697024))<br />
It's always desirable to keep mechanics and stimuli light, but this touches on why I'm so sensitive about systems/UI distracting from world. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/573586395131867136))<br />
I think that is one reason the H&amp;F fight is liked. Mechanics straight forward, not too much stimuli. Then you have forge. Chaos<br />
Yeah, I vastly prefer mechanics that are well represented by the world itself over buffs, arbitrary interactions, etc. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/573616057631420417))<br />
Not always possible though I suppose. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/573617031678853122))<br />
<br />
Negativity rampant on the internet scares me for the sake of children most of all. It's too easy to acclimate to it as a norm of anonymity. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/573715357615050752))<br />
Will online culture evolve past a toxic nature naturally, or does negativity in forums and comments need to be more aggressively enforced? (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/573715867940167680))<br />

Delusional. There's no other word for it, unless you want to call him a liar. Does he read his own forums? Does he ignore the comments everywhere on the state of pvp right now? &quot;We can always do better&quot; is beyond insulting considering how he lowered his trousers and left an oily floater in the game called &quot;Ashran&quot;, and then further insulted everyone by peeing on the game in the form of the CP removal from the bosses. He's happy that Ashran is now a raid group deathball experience doing pve mini events? Is he fucking serious? Or insane? <br />

That is 3 of the 4 classes wich always are in top representation, warrior being the fourth, and while class tuning probably is a factor it isn't as big as you'd expect. Except for druid in this graph atleast. :p</div></div><hr />

Guardians are awful, resto druids and ferals are I guess what you'd call top of the middle pack. The representation is clearly hugely driven by Moonkins, which is no surprise considering how dominant they are on a lot of mythic progression this tier.</div></div><hr />

You don't get the point with sarcasm, so I'll just type it out.<br />

The easiest is a subjective thing. Actually, after ability pruning, I don't think any class is &quot;hard&quot; to play but that doesn't mean I could claim something based on my feelings.</div></div><hr />

It compares same brackets with eachother. So a player with 685 vs 680 both in 95% percentiles brackets, both can be just as skilled. People with 5/10M can have 690ilv, ilv says nothing about difficulty. Harder bosses do not give higher itemlv gear. Some specs get most of their bis on the early bosses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
There is one caveat, as iLevels increase naturally (no boosting) there is a higher chance you have set bonuses. But this iLevel boost can’t magically give you set bonuses, so the increases will probably be a smidge less than data shows.<br />
They mention this in the blog post. <br />
<br />
<br />
The &quot;wipe rate&quot; graph is backwards. Groups which wipe less kill more bosses and have higher ilvl as a result, not the other way around.<br />
<br />
The Y axis is the number of attempts required per kill. Less attempts are required with a higher item level.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also MMO champion, relearn how to do graphs, you genuinely always seem to screw up your graph colors.<br />

The white / yellow show up fine on all of my devices. Usually a few people that haven't calibrated their display at all complain, but it is fine for almost everyone.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why did the AMR thinguy increase ppls ilevel by 2 when the hotfix will increase it by 5 ?<br />
<br />
The hotfix only increases BRF gear. At that item level it isn't likely you have all BRF gear. Your overall item level might only go up by 2.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Will</div><div class="date">2015-03-17, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guardians are awful, resto druids and ferals are I guess what you'd call top of the middle pack. The representation is clearly hugely driven by Moonkins, which is no surprise considering how dominant they are on a lot of mythic progression this tier.<br />
<br />
For a lot of these scenarios the only reason you see Moonkins are dominant is because of these AoE-centric fights. If you ignore simulations and look at accumulated data you'll see that Feral and Balance are neck and neck on Maidens, Balance is ahead on Kromog, Furnace, Thogar, Darmac. As you can see Feral is ahead of balance on 5 fights, and neck-to-neck on one fight. Of those AoE fights Feral is, as you say, upper middle or in some cases LOW in the meters. However, given our niche on fights limited to two targets or less or with minimal target switching, Feral absolutely destroys. <br />
<br />
The main reason balance is so popular is because on fights where Feral shines (feral can easily top 2, or often #1 dps and destroy single-or-dual target fights) but in doing so it's only 3-4k DPS ahead of balance, single-target. Whereas on AoE fights balance is often in excess of 10k DPS ahead of feral. Both specs shine at their niche but balance is so far ahead of feral on AoE it's disgusting. <br />
<br />
Feral is so ridiculously under-represented right now which is surprising given how its strengths in single target are valuable in their own right.<br />
<br />
<br />
That AMR chart is just bad. It doesn't sim or math anything out. It just checks what dps people are doing in the 675 bracket and what people are doing in the 680 bracket and gives you the % improvement you should expect. It doesn't account for that with higher ilvl you probably will get tier bonuses or you just play better because you are doing harder encounters that require more skill to earn that higher gear lvl.<br />
<br />
Are you saying you'd rather go by computer-generated theory numbers as opposed to actual data collected by actual players? Yes, whilst your point is true and some players may have acquired their tier set bonus in the intervening 2 item levels, the whole idea was to get a rough idea, hence why the numbers are rounded off to the nearest tenth.<br />
<br />
Your point that it doesn't account for better play due to a higher skill cap is completely ill-thought out. They used the difference between 670 and 672. Both are item level differences that someone currently progressing in heroic BRF can easily achieve. The only way your point about 'harder encounters' would be valid, would be if AMR were taking data from an item level gap that would typically require players to move from one raid difficulty level to the next. But the difference between 670 and 672 is easily achievable without switching to Mythic and the vast majority of players who GAINED that ilvl difference, did so in normal and heroic modes. (Not switching to mythic = the fights stay the same difficulty = your point invalidated)<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, sims are one thing, but actual, realistic data is far more useful. If you take thousands of samples from thousands of different players, some with tier bonuses, some without, the net result is that the average evens out. You actually end up with a far more useful metric than, say, running computer simulations instead. The mere fact AMR uses an average collected from a huge number of logs means that the resulting number is hardly going to be skewered by the small proportion of participating characters that gained a new set bonus in that two item-level jump.</div></div><hr />

i think it has more to do to the fact that feral is actually quite complicated to master compared to boomy - its a lot easier to pull good numbers on boomy then on feral u just have so much less things to track thats why people go for easy option. other reason is feral is melee and most of playerbase tend to think melee are unwanted for any kind of progress. especially those melee whos tank offspec is underperforming</div></div><hr />

Two things first it's sad you have to try to put down other classes in a video game to try to make yourself feel better and two I've seen just as many bad hunters/pallies/druids/warriors as any other class if not more so, there wouldn't be so many bad players at those classes if they were easy even bads could be good at them.

Simulations are an excellent tool to find out potential DPS, stat weights, test out rotations, etc. But when it comes to actual performance, we like to look at actual performance ;) Especially since each boss is different - so we have DPS data for each specific boss, at each iLevel, for different performance levels. <br />

Or maybe it's because druids are disgustingly strong in addition to being extremely versatile? Other hybrids are nowhere near as strong as druids. Rets? Outperformed by ferals. Shadow priests? Roflstomped by boomkins, and so on. Druids can perform every role and outperform a lot of other specs while at it. It's not just about numbers, since they also have retarded utility and mobility. This is why they have so much representation in the top guilds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rets may outnumber and outperform ferals because they are the only paladin DPS spec, while druids can play boomkin as well as feral. There's also the fact that boomkins only recently got nerfed and feral got buffed - many druids probably didn't get to reroll yet. It may not be the best example, but the point stands - the amount of 685+ druids is through the roof and it's not just because they can perform every role (especially considering that Guardian is useless compared to other tanks). This is also shown in PvP, where almost 20% of people qualifying for Gladiator right now are druids. Druids should get either their utility (mobility, mostly) or numbers nerfed to the ground. They just bring too much too the table and are too versatile compared to other classes, this is a fact. They have the best mobility of all classes (except of monks, maybe), they bring all kinds of utility skills based on spec, and they are very high on meters regardless of their spec. Blizzard's &quot;bring the player, not the class&quot; rule is just dead when it comes to druids. Right now it's &quot;bring the druid, not the player&quot;.</div></div><hr />

The difference being that if you killed blackhand wed/thurs before the change went live, say, sat, you lost loot. Thus they waited.<br />
If you kill your farm wed/thurs before ilvls, you won't lose anything when the patch deploys saturday. Sure, it might be EASIER to farm after the patch, but it's no direct loss in potential power gain (and everyone are in the same boat).</div></div><hr />

<br />
No reason why it couldn't be. I've played feral for years and I'm generally in the 95th-99th percentile, and although we don't raid mythic, I can top every fight in our guilds heroic except for kromog, beastlord or bf (and maybe maidens)<br />
<br />
Given current scaling I see no valid reason why a kitty couldn't end a mythic raid in the top half, if put up against similarly-skilled players. Even on AoE fights although my overall damage is low if I look at damage done to the boss only, it's usually a good 30% higher than the next person.<br />
<br />
Do you see many feral in mythic? Thought not. It's s spec with a high skill ceiling, so bad players will further under-represent it overall. I end a lot of AoE fights in the 80th percentile for my ilvl. Not too shabby for a spec that sucks at AoE.</div></div><hr />
