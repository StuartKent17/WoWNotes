Question Suggestions<br />
Since we'll be interviewing developers during the tour, if you have something you really really want to ask about Mists of Pandaria, now might be a good time to bring it up in the comments. We'll pick the best questions and add them to our existing list. I'd love to see if you guys can suggest of something we haven't thought of!<br />
<br />
Before posting a question, check and make sure it hasn't been answered by reviewing what we already know (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1007250-Mists-of-Pandaria-Blizzcon-2011-Summary) about the expansion. <br />

Blue Posts<br />
Missing out on Scroll of Resurrection<br />
I'm going to respond to this simply because I've seen this sort of sentiment before, and while I have no doubt that not everyone will accept the answer I will give here, I'm going to give it anyway.<br />
<br />
There is an assumption that we don't care about our long term customers. This couldn't be further from the truth. We absolutely care, and part of that is the ongoing efforts we make every day to communicate, to share what we're doing, to listen to what you are saying here and elsewhere about what more you want to see in the game and more. We also heard you say that you wanted to get your friends back that have previously left the game, so we revisited the Scroll of Resurrection so you could see about enticing them to return and play. This is our way of empowering you with a way to convince your friends that there is a benefit to coming back and that it will be as painless as possible to get caught up with you (thus the boost and transfer.) The level differences and even realm differences are often something people have said serve as a barrier to convincing their friends to return. So, we're doing what we can to move those obstacles away, at least for a little while.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry to hear that your own friend wasn't able to benefit from the promotion, but there has to be a start and end to these things. Anytime we've run promotions in the past, there has always been someone somewhere who didn't get a chance to take part. We do what we can though to spread the word and make it as available as possible, but we have to be careful about limitations as well. We'll make sure to let people know if new such opportunities come up. It sounds as if (though) that you're having a good time leveling up together and that seems like a big win for you overall. We hope that you continue to do so since having fun is what the game is all about.It's for a limited period of time, but we don't have a specific date to give you. We'll do our best to give people some warning before it ends. I'd tell your friends that it's better to do it sooner rather than later to be safe, but it's completely up to them on what works for them. Since the promotion just started, we still have some time yet though. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/218608-missing-out-on-scroll-of-resurrection/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4142246808?page=12#224))<br />
<br />
Is There Anything Positive Going On?<br />
There's plenty of positive, but we go through these periods between content sometimes where people start looking for the &quot;next big thing&quot; if they feel they've done it all in game. People who are generally happy, tend to just play the game for what it is and we rarely see them on the forums. (That's not to say that we don't get people who are also happy on the forums too.) People who feel that there needs to be change to the game or have run into things they aren't happy with, tend to come to the forums to talk about it. They come to discuss it with other people here and see if they're the only one feeling a certain way, or they hope that one of us will see it and pass word along to the developers.<br />
<br />
Frankly, we love getting to see constructive feedback whether it's positive (I love this thing because of xyz!) or more negative (I don't like this because xyz.) I sound like a broken record when I say this but, it's a truth that any community manager knows passionate people post passionately. If apathy wins, all you hear is silence. I'd much rather see that people still care than deal with no one talking about anything.<br />
<br />
That said though, it's important not to let other's negative perceptions color your own (as difficult as that may sometimes be.) If you're having fun and enjoying the game for what it is, there is no reason at all you can't continue to do so. Your fun is purely your own.<br />
<br />
It won't be long though and we'll have more to share on the ongoing development for the game and Mists of Pandaria, so hopefully that will lighten the mood a little.

War College - The Battle for Gilneas<br />
The battlefields of World of Warcraft are littered with the bones of those who have become casualties in the ongoing conflict between the Horde and the Alliance. You do not need to become one of them. One of the keys to victory is knowledge, and that is where the World of Warcraft War College enters the picture. In these discussions between players, you can learn and share strategies with other players to improve your tactics and improve your odds of emerging victorious from the field of battle.<br />
<br />
Are you a veteran Gladiator with countless victories tallied? Are you new to World of Warcraft and striving to improve your PvP skills? In this weekly feature, we invite players of all skill levels to ask questions, share tips and tactics, and join a conversation dedicated to surviving and thriving in World of Warcraft PvP.<br />
<br />
This week, the topic of discussion is:<br />
<br />
The Battle for Gilneas - Which strategies are most effective in this battleground for both rated and un-rated play? What tips, tricks and tactics have you discovered? What common mistakes have you witnessed?<br />

Are the old character models going to be updated for the Monk class, and if so, will it be in time for the release?<br />
What do the female Pandaren look like?<br />
Examples of Monk talents and abilities? More examples, I should say, we already know they can roll and do a Whirlwind with their feet.<br />

<br />
You would have to read through the Guild Summit coverage (http://www.darthhater.com/articles/swtor-news/19973-guild-summit-stream-live-blog) for all the details.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc810e31c697</div><div class="date">2012-03-12, 01:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not overly impressed with their response to long-term players not being rewarded yet newer players get it all (Cataclysm largely being centred around them in the form of redesigned lands and the like). Though I'm not quite sure what people are expecting from Blizzard, a mount depending upon how many years you've been playing for?Get real, that would imply exclusivity. Blizzard doesn't do exclusivity any more.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SinR</div><div class="date">2012-03-12, 01:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In regards to raiding, is the stacking buff/debuff that was present in ICC (Hellscream's Warsong/Strength of Wrynn) and is currently stacking in Dragon Soul (Power of the Aspects) eventually going to become the norm for normal/heroic raid instances? 5% debuff a month until the next tier of raid is released? <br />
<br />
Also, in regards to Achievements, Blizzard mentioned that ALL achievements are going account wide in Mists. Would that mean that upon rolling a new character we get our Glory meta mounts in the mail? How will &quot;What A Long Strange Trip It's Been&quot; work... will ALL characters have 310 riding at level 1? What about titles, like Hand of A'dal or Destroyer's End?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cptaylor38</div><div class="date">2012-03-12, 01:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To post this. Didn't see a comment button at the bottom for some reason.<br />
<br />
But just a few questions:<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Do you plan on making any changes to professions to reduce the mat materials especially for lower level engineers and leatherworkers? It gets fairly difficult collecting some of the mats when trying to level the profession as you level up due to needing various somewhat hard to come by supplies. Not to mention that they can sometimes be fairly costly.<br />
<br />
2. Do you plan on adding any Pandaria themed classic dungeons or revamping any? I've noticed recently that the 50-60 bracket is fairly limited.<br />
<br />
3. With the addition of Monks, will you be adding a lot more fist weapon models? I've long awaited the day that I could wield more diverse weapon models such as the warglaive style and the Sentinel three bladed weapons. As well as different fitting armor such as Maeiv's cape and shoulders or ragged demon hunter kilts?</div></div><hr />

Good point, you guys and DH are both curse sites.<br />
<br />
Anyway, since Pork asked. There's the improved legacy system (all races all classes, legacy attacks), a new Operation (like a WoW raid), new Flashpoint (WoW dungeon), UI customization, and a bunch of other stuff (COMBAT LOG)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mrcoolguyry</div><div class="date">2012-03-12, 01:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off: The TOR video was awesome. For questions to ask at the press event: 1. How many different varieties of scenarios will there be (like escorting a person, defending a town or city from invading forces, or just the usual defeat a boss and his minions type thing) 2. What kind of achievements will be account-wide for your characters? (i.e What a Long Strange Trip It's Been, 150 pets, 100 mounts, and also any Glory of the Raider achievements) 3. When will we get a peak at the monk class abilities and talent tree? 4. How will the scaling for your item level in Challenge Mode Dungeons work? Is your item level set to a prefixed number and your character is specified to correspond with that item level with the same amount of health, damage, and healing (i.e 359 fixed item level= 359 item level health, damage, and healing) 5. And finally, with plans to release content faster, would you have some patches be dedicated to bug fixes and minor content updates while other patches could be dedicated to dungeons, battlegrounds, raids, and arenas with otherwise more major content updates?</div></div><hr />

But last I checked MMO-Champ news were nigh WoW exclusive despite its name (or at least Blizzard related).<br />
If I wanted SWTOR news, I'd go to Darthhater.[/QUOTE]<br />
I think MMO-Champion being mostly WoW-Related for a long time due to the lack of other MMO news roundups isn't eternal (doesn't need to be, at least). Just saying there's no problem about a SWTOR news here. I think MMOChamp could put Rift news upfront too, I like it being really MMO-oriented than just WoW-related.<br />
<br />
And I agree about DarthHater, but MMO being older, it's easier to flash things here, imo.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc810e31c697</div><div class="date">2012-03-12, 01:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyway here's my real question, and is the deciding factor in whether or not I will actually come back to WoW.<br />
<br />
<br />
Are you going to re-introduce any *real* incentives for the more competitive side of raiding or will it be similar to the current model for the forseeable future?<br />
<br />
<br />
While I have every confidence that at first the proposed Challenge modes will live up to their name and reward appropriately, after the Cataclysm debacle I have little confidence that it will not be adjusted to make them more accesible.The Special-Snowflake term is one I hate, and is thrown around negatively, yet it is a fundamental part of why people (used) to play MMO's. I am all for making raid content accessible, yet as of Dragon Soul there is effectively zero incentive for taking the more challenging approach in this game other than enhanced stats. Don't get me wrong, I'm not going to stick around for years and whine about the situation hoping for it to change, I'd rather know in advance so I can take my money elsewhere quietly.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ferocity</div><div class="date">2012-03-12, 01:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have next question for Press Tour:<br />
<br />
With so many changes being planned for game mechanics, do you plan to rework how ratings' system works entirely? As a stats, taken together with mana cost of abilities, they heavily penalize players during level-up, especially at higher levels. It also leads to many abnormal situations, where, in example, you have hit cap against mob with fixed level X, and after level up you start getting misses against same mob of X level. Do you plan to address this issue?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Themos</div><div class="date">2012-03-12, 01:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Q1<br />
Do you think the Challenges will be dominated by certain class combinations due to buff/debuff combinations? How do you think this will impact certain classes that bring little wrt DPS buffs, such as healing priests only bringing a Stamina buff?<br />
<br />
<br />
Q2<br />
Leveling weapons are a concern for the new Monk class. Leveling a Monk from 1 to 85 will be an arduous process, will there be heirloom gear added for Monk leveling that we will have access to at level 80/85 to help things along? If no heirloom weapons will be available specifically, will there be new weapons options from quest rewards the whole way up?<br />
<br />
Q3<br />
With the revamp to how talent trees will work in Mists of Pandaria, will players be able to change their talents as easily as in Diablo III or will a visit to class trainers be necessary?<br />
<br />
Q4<br />
Can you tell us anything really cool about world PvP in MoP? Will there be any motivation for going out in the world and picking a fight?<br />
<br />
<br />
Q5<br />
Many of us are at cap and would have to delete a character to make room for a Monk. Will you consider increasing the number of character slots allotted per server? <br />
<br />
Q6<br />
Any information on how Inscription profession be effected by the talent revamps would be appreciated. How much is the glyphing system changing and is the profession getting anything new with MoP?</div></div><hr />

<br />
They said:<br />
<br />
-VP Dailies spread around Pandaria. People will be doing them while in dungeon queue for bonus VP. Why wouldn't some one want free VP?<br />
-Scenarios have to be queued for at the location in the open world.<br />
-World bosses<br />
-Alliance and Horde hub which are close enough to replicate Southshore/Tarren Mill's distance...which should encourage world PvP which keeps people from afking in the city.<br />
-Many hidden easter eggs all over the world. Probably similar to the camel mount/statues.<br />
-Pet trainers for pet battles are spread around the world.<br />
-Bunch of other stuff I can't remember because it wasn't that prominent.<br />
<br />
They've given us pleeeenty of info about whats going to encourage people. I'd rather they ask a question that touches upon something we never heard about.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
My question:<br />
<br />
Ask them to go into depth about challenge mode dungeons. How will the ranking system will work for example. How many times do they plan on letting the debuff stack? Will it require a premade group?</div></div><hr />

someone has already mentioned toon slots<br />
<br />
I would actually like to ask if the tradeskills are going to be more useful end game; As I am in a small guild and many of our players have gone I am only seeing dragon soul on lfr(apparently bloodscalp is quickly becoming a low pop server) and find crafting skills of little to no use as some of the mats needed come from raiding in regular mode, and inscription is pretty useless engame even if you are raiding.<br />
<br />
I would also like to see if there is something that can be done with boa gear after it is used to level(I have 4 sets now just taking up space).<br />
<br />
hmmm what else....Oh yeah, do they have anything planned to do with Karazhan....that whole zone and it's creepy vibe seems such a waste for it to sit there outdated<br />
<br />
also mage ports.....seems kinda silly but we have ports to the major cities...then outlands came along so we got stonard and shatt....northrend came about and we got dalaran.....cata we got tol borad but vashir and uldum IMO were much needed, can we expect the portals a mage can make to be updated</div></div><hr />

It would sure be nice to know I can transmog/reforge/change hairstyle/port to quest zones in whatever city I enjoy being in without having to go to SW (or any single location) for everything. A current example; Archaeology gets me out into the world - being forced to go SW for everything (especially when focused on Tol'vir and there being no portal in Uldum to SW) is a real inconvienance. I'd like to be able to, for example, stop by darnassus for whatever it is I need and know it is there without having to go to some central city.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. About pet battles and such, they said that the pets would become shared across the account. I am assuming that this only means per server, or is there a chance it could -maybe- actually be for the entire account cross server included? <br />
<br />
2. Like Lostobject had mentioned a few posts up, is it possible we will see more character slots for Mists? I have a full account and the lowest is 76 ... I dislike the idea of having to delete an 85 just to make room for a new class or race. <br />
<br />
3. While its not directly related to Mists, I am curious about if the Night elves will be able to reclaim and rebuild Auberdine at any point in the distant future? XP I hated it when that zone let alone hub was destroyed.</div></div><hr />

Any GOOD question i can think of will never get answered as they are pretty much all of the lore variety and they won't answer those before it ships.One thing i can ask though. Are we going to see any real pandarian developments in the world beyond pandaria, I know they said they might throw an NPC here and theer such as a monk trainer. But i mean for example, say a pandarian settlement here and there, similar to the worgen settlement in blasted lands that really help fill a void down there. there are still areas that quite frankly are not getting used at all in a few zones still that could use a nice town thrown in there. I realize not to expect an old world revamp. But a town or two wouldn't hurt in some pretty terrible zones. Heck, while at it, if they put them anywhere in stormwind, let it be the park. that's right, in MoP they better rebuild teh dang park and put some panda's in it. What kind of king builds statues of himself but leave a gaping hole for a park. Rebuild it into &quot;china town&quot; themed area. :D</div></div><hr />

Are there any plans to streamline the health pool for players and quest mobs as you level up, for the entire game? Ending with the northerend content, and moving on to vashj'ir or Mount hyjal can be a little difficult, especially for players on their first character. Since you have to move on from level 80s monsters in northerend that have 12,600HP to about 30,000 HP in cataclysm, it does not feel very natural.</div></div><hr />

The main reason I did not create a Goblin/Worgen for about a month was the fear of it taking to long due to overpopulation. When I buy MoP, I want to be able to play without having to constantly compete for quest completions. Question 2: Do you have any plans to make professions more &quot;Fun&quot;. Getting rare procs out of making low grade items makes it exciting. Also, do you have plans on making professions more than just collecting mats and pressing a button to create the item? Question 3: How will world pvp be effected by realms that have a population heavily leaning toward one side. For example .2 horde to every 1 alliance for vise versa.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talyrius</div><div class="date">2012-03-12, 02:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reputation<br />
<br />
There has been a lot of discussion about account-wide achievements, pets, mounts, and etc., but where does reputation fit into all of this?<br />
Are there any plans to remove the factions where reputation is no longer attainable (Gelkis/Magram Clan Centaur, Zandalar Tribe, and Shen'dralar); perhaps only if the player isn't already exalted with them? For those of us that are a bit OCD, seeing these factions and knowing you can no longer do anything with them can be aggravating.<br />
Raiding<br />
<br />
Right now, most heroic 10-man raid encounters are still designed with the assumption that you'll have more ranged DPS than melee. Can group composition be made to be more lenient in this regard?<br />
Challenge Modes<br />
<br />
Has there been any discussion regarding giving us the ability to (optionally) use the same gear normalization that's being employed in challenge modes in other areas of the game (old raids/dungeons, questing, and etc.)? Helping friends on lower level characters would sometimes be more enjoyable if your presence didn't automatically trivialize the content.<br />
User Interface<br />
<br />
Can you give addon authors the ability to modify font strings generated by the game engine (above the heads of players and NPC's)—or at least a place to anchor to when nameplates aren't visible? This would allow customization of the damage/healing done information that is shown overhead as well as the ability to enhance readability of names.<br />
Can the GetGameTime() function be updated to return seconds as well as consistently give the player's realm time instead of sometimes giving the instance server's time (which may be in a different timezone).<br />
Would you consider allowing the use of in-game links as well as (functional) external ones to the GMotD (Guild Message of the Day) and Guild Information areas? Linking guild achievements you're currently working on or directing guild members to something relevant outside of the game (such as the guild's website) could be quite helpful.<br />
Account Services<br />
<br />
Is there any chance of offering us bundle and bulk discounts for paid services such as realm transfers and faction changes? When our guilds or friends decide to use these services, we're forced to stay behind or dig deeply (very deeply in the case of alternative characters) into our pockets.</div></div><hr />

From preliminary views, it looks like it will only add a little fluff and not really be as compelling as it could be, despite only being a controversial side-effect of MoP. It seems the community is divided in whether it should even be in the game, so will it be a part of the game that's actually worth investing a moderate amount of time in, or become an Archaeology-type side thing that people hardly even like to do most of the time?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DoomRyder</div><div class="date">2012-03-12, 02:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) Quests which came before actual Expansion (during Elemental Upheaval World event and BEFORE The Shattering) were nice refreshment comparing to others (starting quests of Dwarves during and after leaving Coldridge Pass are one of the many). Some of them remained the same while others showed you just how much zone is affected by Deathwing's return. Can we expect new quests centered around expansion's new theme?<br />
<br />
2) Racial Leader's Short stories were nice addition for people who like story progression of expansion just as much as getting new set of shoulders or weapon that is made in image of Twilight's Hammer's symbol (one of my favourite weapon model of Cataclysm btw). But some details in said stories were left unanswered; for example, does Sylvanas have her own agenda regarding Forsaken and their status in Horde? Will some secrets be revealed in Mists of Pandaria?<br />
<br />
3) I don't know about you but something about that cannon in Azshara seems very... imposing. What is it's purpose? Who made it? And why is it targeting on Undercity when I position myself on it?<br />
<br />
4) Again with quests... leveling through new 1-60 content was intriguing (leveled on both Kalimdor AND Eastern Kingdoms). Although I can feel that Outland's remake will come in next expansion, what about Northrend? Some quests were remade from Group to Normal for leveling alts, but what about story? When will we see Northrend that was left behind and its content - Vrykul attack of Horde's base in Borean Tundra or remains of Wyrmrest Temple (ruined from events in Twilight of the Aspects and Dragon Soul)?<br />
<br />
5) One thing that puzzled me the most till this moment was when I went to Stormwind's Chappel and told Bishop about events after the end of Hour of Twilight dungeon. He first discarded news calling them blasphemy and petty gossip. Afterwards he mentioned that there's rumour about certain &quot;new Lord of the Scourge&quot;. Yes, you guessed it. Will Alliance leaders eventually find out about Bolvar's secret?<br />

<br />
As in, will LFR be considered a stepping-stone into normal mode raiding? Or, will LFR be its own &quot;thing,&quot; and the more hardcore raiders will be able to jump from 5man heroic to normal raids without feeling obligated to run LFR for the gear (although, admittedly, some of the more dedicated raiders will run LFR concurrently with normal raids to supplement their gear).<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Challenge Modes were introduced as a time trial for groups of players using level appropriate gear and stats. With this in mind, it makes sense to assume that Shaman and Mages will be overrepresented in these dungeons, due to Blood Lust/Time Warp. <br />
<br />
What do you plan to do to combat these (assumed) imbalances -- will BL/TW simply not be usable in challenge modes, or will other classes be given a similar ability to allow for more group diversity without &quot;gimping&quot; your challenge mode group?</div></div><hr />

We have still failed to see the promised conversion of all tanking classes to an active mitigation system. Is this still happening, and if so, how do your propose to balance it? In a new active tanking paradigm, where do the less talented players who have enjoyed tanking up until now, fit in? Will there be a low bar to pass? Will it be &quot;easy to play, difficult to master&quot;? Will the difficulty across the bored be different between the 5 tanking classes or will there be a difficulty curve?

More character slots, we need them badly , especially with the addition of an 11th class, do they have any more information on the possibility of removing the per-server limit that they were floating around earlier?<br />
<br />
I second this(or rather, I'm probably the 30th person this thread to mention it by now...). Primarily I think this because of the 11th class, but also it would be nice to have more freedom in character selection, and not have to delete a character because I'm 'full' and I just wanna mess around with a friend on my server. It has many uses beyond just getting us enough slots to play with for monks. I know many people who like to have multiple of the same class, just using different styles(one pvp with both specs being different types of pvp, and another of the same class with say a tank and dps spec, instead of what I've got right now, which is juggling gear and respec costs, when I'd be more than willing to just level another character with as much time as I put into the game.</div></div><hr />

Gearing in 10 man is broken. It was originally balanced around 12(13) bosses (and even then was too slow). Firelands cut down on the number of bosses and DS made Tier items part of the 2 items per boss (instead of an extra 3rd). Both changes effectively lowering the gear acquisition rate of raiding guilds. Are there plans to fix this in the expansion? We don't care if 25 mans gear faster, but 10's gear impossibly slow right now. It makes gearing up replacement raiders nearly impossible and drastically slows down progression.</div></div><hr />

In Cataclysm head enchants were BoA, but the shoulder enchants demanded the same tiresome grind which took its toll on players with more than 2 active max level characters for sure. Will everything be done with a few dailies and a tabard again, or will we get the fun TBC faction grinds back? Getting exalted with Netherwing or Kurenai felt like it meant something, in WOTLK only the Argent Crusade managed to accomplish that feeling and in Cataclysm not a single faction accomplished that goal. A few dailies and a tabard does not make it a fun faction to get exalted with, and having mandatory gear enchants from 4-5 different factions does not equal fun either. <br />
<br />
Factions should be about rewards for taking the time and effort to get exalted, with the rewards not going out of date in one patch. In other words, mounts/vanity items (Mogging sets!) and pets.<br />

Mounts:Will there finally be new mounts added to areas such as the War mount vendor, a new Dalaran style vendor in a major city and such? The Dalaran mount vendor kept a lot of collectors busy for a long time. Will some mounts (such as Talbuks) get reworked in terms of textures and animations? Everything pre-Cata looks a bit too 2006 at the moment when compared to new mounts. More wolves/horses like the RBG-ones would be nice since they have truly awesome textures.Overall, will there be more mounts to work for that are not rare drops/meta? Cataclysm had too few of them. <br />
<br />
Mounts do not always have to be superultraawesomesaucerareandjustforonepersonperservertoenjoy, us mountcrazed people are happier the more mounts there are to grind for.<br />
<br />
Will Zul'Gurub be adapted so that it can be soloed equally by all classes? Most people expect to solo old content for mount drops, but as of now the Raptor boss cannot be soloed by classes relying on pets.<br />
<br />
Hunter: <br />
<br />
Will the hunter class get more stable slots in order to fit both Vanilla/TBC/WOTLK/Cataclysm AND MoP unique rare pets? Most true rare beast hunters have filled their stables to the brim and surely MoP will bring new unique beasts with it. Hunters need a better way to stable their pets, and more slots, maybe even an infinite amount of stable slots with nifty solutions. Why is the hunter class getting expertise? Does this not just represent a new useless stat that's being added without any real need for it? Hunters have always appealed to me thanks to their easy-to-balance Hit cap and no expertise to dabble in. Account wide matters:Will we finally get cross-realm heirlooms?Will account-wide achievements even include things like factions? Will all characters be exalted with a faction if you achieve that goal once? Will titles be shared across characters?Will account-wide companion pets also include pets gotten from rare drops/quests/factions?<br />
<br />
Old character models:<br />
<br />
There's a lot of speculation here. Some say that new models NEEDS to happen for MoP thanks to the Monk class, some races will simply look terrible with their current outdated animations and textures. Others say that you won't &quot;bother&quot; with this until a patch at the end of the expansion in order to reel players back in when they start growing bored.<br />
<br />
Personally I'd like to see it happen for MoP release, because I have seen female human rogues do a kick...it ain't purrty. <br />
<br />
The most important:When will MoP be out so that we can enjoy it??</div></div><hr />

<br />
In regards to raiding, is the stacking buff/debuff that was present in ICC (Hellscream's Warsong/Strength of Wrynn) and is currently stacking in Dragon Soul (Power of the Aspects) eventually going to become the norm for normal/heroic raid instances? 5% debuff a month until the next tier of raid is released? <br />
<br />
Also, in regards to Achievements, Blizzard mentioned that ALL achievements are going account wide in Mists. Would that mean that upon rolling a new character we get our Glory meta mounts in the mail? How will &quot;What A Long Strange Trip It's Been&quot; work... will ALL characters have 310 riding at level 1? What about titles, like Hand of A'dal or Destroyer's End?

How will the developers ensure each same role spec feels unique, thematic, and compelling? Are we supposed to just abide by rotational timing differences (which, in my opinion wouldnt really differentiate say an arms warrior from a fury warrior - who cares what the abillities are called if output is the same), or do the developers forsee certain niches for each spec, and if so what are those niches?

For a long time in WoW it felt like whatever length of time you had to play you could find a task to fit that timespan. If you had half an hour, there was Arathi Basin or Warsong Gulch, some daily quest areas, short instances etc, if you had an hour there were some longer instances, you could go to Alterac Valley for a while, take on some of the longer questlines, if you had even longer you had reputations to grind, epic quests to do (for some classes), the biggest instances. It felt like you could always find a task that would take however long you had to play.Over time the game has become such that pretty much everything in the game is designed around 20-30 minute time chunks. Instances, quest hubs, battlegrounds etc are all designed with this in mind. Is there any concern that this has led to WoW feeling less like an MMO and more like a collection of mini-games with raids being the only larger content, Will this be a trend we see being reinforced or backed away from in MoP?</div></div><hr />

<br />
1- Faster content development: Yea wasn't that what you told us in Cata and please don't respond with quality over quantity as I'd take any TBC raid over this high quality expansion that is Cata <br />
<br />
2- Bring people back to the world: How? I don't see any feature or world event that is supposed to do that. <br />
<br />
3- Class Balance: Well I've played this game too long to believe that will ever happen. <br />
<br />
4- More things to do at max level: Again aside from Pokemon I don't see anything added to high level content. How are they going to achieve this? <br />
<br />
So I guess my only question is: How they are going to achieve what they are advertising for this expansion? I hear the talk but I don't see the means.</div></div><hr />

In addition, since it seems that we are balanced around our Heal-Over-Time effects, our Direct Healing spells are extremely weak compared to other classes. Back during Wrath, we were the HoT king, and could easily use our effects to heal many encounters. During the beggining of the Cataclysm, we had extremely strong Area of Effet healing because of our HoTs. Currently, however, we are the weakest in terms of AoE healing. Paladins excel at healing stacked AoE situations with Divine Radiance, where they can put out extremely strong numbers in a very short time. Holy Priests are currently significantly better then druids in the AoE healing department- They can heal up to 5 people for a large amount of healing at once. Shamans have improved greatly in terms of AoE healing- With Chain heal for burst AoE, and Healing Rain for stable AoE, they can match up to any situation, and the more incoming damage, the stronger they become. Discipline Priests are around the bottom in terms of AoE healing throughput, but thier ability to shield large groups of ppl pre-emptively is extremely strong. In addition, each class brings more then pure healing numbers to the table. So, my question is- Will druids be relooked at and buffed to be competitive with the many changes to other healers?</div></div><hr />

Will raids and PvP be balanced around the assumption that all players will both have and be using these self heals and shields to the best of their ability? For instance, a mages lvl 90 talent is a shield that absorbs up to 30% of health in damage and transfers that into mana, as well as another ability that can take all damage done over 4 seconds and make it undone over 6. Should damage not be balanced around this, Mages and a few other classes will be unkillable in 1v1 and hard to kill in 2v2. Should damage in PvE be balanced around this, classes without these heals will be sat in favor of classes with the heals.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, few MoP-questions:<br />
<br />
1. Are tier bonuses going to be playstyle-changing, like hunter T13 2P bonus? Just started to gear my retri paladin and when trying to learn up from forums etc., they all say &quot;t13 blaablaa&quot; when i'm not going to get any piece of T13. <br />
<br />
2. Are tier sets going to be obtainable only from raiding (LFR and up) and not just from valor points? I dont care if i can't ever get them, but if they have life-improving set bonuses, it's going to be irritating to have none.<br />
<br />
3. Now that you are going to implement spec-detecting feature for raid rolls (?), is it possible to make system that does not drop useless loot from dungeons/raids? Like plate armor if by some chance no-one in 5-man group can wear it?<br />
<br />
4. What's going to happen to throwing weapons? Are they going to be changed to gray vendor junk or just one-handed weapons? I'd personally like to transmog my daggers to small and pointy ones, like some throwing daggers. (and if we could turn enchants off in future, all the better!)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lac</div><div class="date">2012-03-12, 04:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">QUESTIONS FOR DEVS: In each expansion there has been unresolved storylines and underutilized zones which felt, from a player perspective, like unfinished content. In Wrath of the Lich King we saw the zone of Cystalsong with two towers on either side that never seemed to get used, A giant building in Zul'Drak that looked as though it was prime for a raid zone, unused portals under Wymrest and there were plenty of stories left unresolved like the return of Malganis and the threat of the Kvladir, to name a few. In Cataclysm, there was the Abyssal Maw (which has been talked about plenty by now), a War of the Ancients raid that became a 5 man and only three raid tiers instead of four. Were these things victims of being overly ambitious or cut due to time contraints and how to do plan to develop Mists of Pandaria so that you can avoid these types of issues moving forward? Cataclysm had less raid instances, less five man instances and less bosses overall than any previous expansion. In Mists of Pandaria, will we see more bosses and more raids/five mans? Class specific question: Using the Warlock as an example, the thing that appealed to me about Warlocks when I first started playing WoW were that they were like a darker mage, mistrusted by their faction but tolerated nonetheless. Class quests and trainer locations (and their dialogue) were core to this feeling but over the course of the last few expansions, warlocks seem to be getting closer and closer to a mage and losing their indentity. Since Blizzard has expressed in the past that Class quests can take up too much development resources, would it be possible to instead set up class 'guilds' a building in the city that is devoted to the lore and culture of a specific class where you can talk to NPCs to learn more about your class, perhaps even have tutorial NPCs to help new players learn rotations and mechanics. You could have &quot;The Mages College&quot; &quot;The Warlocks Den&quot; &quot;The Hunters Lodge&quot; &quot;The Druids Retreat&quot; and so on. Last question: &quot;Will the damage done by Deathwing to stormwind be repaired in Mists of Pandaria or will the park and the front gates be permanently damaged? Those workmen have been working on repairing the place for over a year now and havent got much done, perhaps it is time for new contractors?</div></div><hr />

However, my big question is: Are professions going to get the overhaul they so desperately need? So much of the game has been updated, changed, and modernized over the years, and yet the profession system is largely unchanged since 2004. I'm not calling for a new system, just take the new ideas that have been added to professions over the years (like tinkers or added gem sockets) and add them throughout the level range. Crafting professions are honestly more trouble than they're worth to pursue while leveling. They ONLY have any real value at cap (gathering can be used to make money). So ask them that for me. Please Blizzard, please, show professions some love.</div></div><hr />

In the current game, you reward people for not going out into the world: people who queue up in the Dungeon Finder get rewarded with VP or JP, yet people who put time and effort in gathering 4 companions and travelling to the instance get punished by receiving no reward at all (hence you won't find anyone doing the latter these days). <br />
<br />
<br />
Have you considered giving &quot;non-LFD dungeons&quot; the same reward as &quot;LFD dungeons&quot;? What about taking it even further and giving them a greater reward, in order to give players a bigger incentive to travel out into the world? <br />
<br />
<br />
Daily heroic dungeon lockouts still apply, so it's not possible for a group to simply travel to the easiest dungeon, do it X times and be capped on VP for the week.</div></div><hr />

Raids like Ulduar, Kara, BT, Ahn'qiraj and so on - The ones that some players still haven't even fully explored.- From the screenshots i've seen Pandaria is very beautiful, and that's cool. But are there any zones that are the complete opposite? I like a bit of variety:).- What are your thoughts on the state of class balance once Monks are implemented?- When will more monk abilities be released for us to see? Currently, as far as I know, we can only see up to about level 10 (excluding talents).- If you raised the character limit per realm to 50, then I asked for you to restore EVERY character i've ever deleted so that I had 50 85's - Would you do it? :D- Guards, are they being nerfed?- Are you planning to remove any titles/achievements for the release of MoP?- Is it your current plan to keep raid finder going the way it is now?- Any news on the level 90 shaman talents? :D- Next legendary plans?- Cross-realm achievements, will that stack grinded achievements? Say I had 50k honorable kills on 5 seperate characters, would I get 'the bloodthirsty' on all of them?- And are Cross-realm achievements going to count for anything? My shaman is my main, but I hate pvping on it. I also like achievements, but it's hard to get on my shaman when I have no motivation to get PvP gear on it - Would achievements like Gladiator carry over from other characters? And would you have access to the titles or just the achievement?- What are your thoughts on the speed leveling is now? Slower leveling but more powerful heirlooms was an idea that I liked - As it stands you can literally complete just over half of a zone max (depending on the size of it), then the quests turn grey.Just a 'few' off the top of my head:)<br />

While this is more of a request, Please inform the player base if something has decided to have to be cut back on ahead of time. One of the things that irks me the most is that there was barely any mention of the Azshara Crater, Dance Studio, Ajzol-Nerub questing zone, Well of Eternity raid, and Abyssal Maw raid being cut before it was cut, but rather just happened and was answered by the questions of curious players. I would rather not have to get MoP in order to discover that you can't capture pets in the wild.</div></div><hr />

They have mentioned that they may one day make mounts account-wide, however they've never said that it was even on the table for mists of pandaria (I wouldn't expect them to make a change that large except during an expansion launch).

Will there be any rereleased content at higher levels, like heroic Deadmines, SFK, and Molten Core? Will we ever see Dread/Pit Lords anymore? I miss those mutton-chops. Will there be an additional character slot for the monk? If so, and you charge money for it, can people with 10 85s get it for free, like me? The Wormhole Generator has the additional tag &quot;Northrend.&quot; Does that mean it might come back for MoP? Are monks still using the click-per-attack method? If so, how likely are you going to be sued for carpal tunnel? But in all seriousness, if someone has to click a button each time they attack, don't you think that will deter players from being monks? With all the spells that draw in enemies, can someone spell reflect them? If so, does it draw in everyone around the reflector, or does it just draw in the reflectee, like with Dead Grip? Will there ever be an option to level death knights from 1 like normal characters, since they aren't that heroic anymore? With all the racism in Azeroth, how will the Pandaren be treated, especially from jerks like Garrosh? There won't be any Kung Fu Panda references in MoP, right? ...right? Please god...</div></div><hr />

LFD, LFR, 10 and 25 sharing lock out, seems like the massive has been taken out of MMO. Seems like there is no need to be in a guild any more which is a shame , the best part of playing a mmo is the community even more than the game itself. Going from WoTLK to Cata they said they would continue to encourage 25man by allowing more valor but they removed. <br />
<br />
How do they feel about the state of 25man raiding , why did you stop encouraging 25mans in Cata , will they encourage in MoP or allow it to continue to decline, is it important to have 25man raiding or would the game be same with only 10man?</div></div><hr />

<br />
afaik we can still equip melee weapons. but bows/xbows/guns are 2h weapons, so we cant use both at the same time. and obviously using melee weapons as a hunter will not get you very far.<br />
<br />
and i sure hope ranged weapons show up on our backs. been wanting that since it happened with a bug back in BC :P</div></div><hr />
