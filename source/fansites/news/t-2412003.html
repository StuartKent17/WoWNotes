Many spells and cooldowns that were once off the global cooldown are now on the global cooldown.<br />

<br />
Artifact Weapons DisabledripArtifact<br />
<br />
All traits and abilities attached to artifact weapons will become disabled, including those from the Netherlight Crucible and your relics. Relics can still be slotted into the weapon, but all they do is increase the item level of the weapon.<br />
Certain abilities from the artifact weapon have been incorporated into specs as either baseline or talents.<br />
The base tint for mage tower skins is no longer obtainable, but if you managed to unlock it you can still unlock the other colors.<br />
The artifact skin tint tied to completing a Mythic +15 in time is still obtainable in BfA by completing one of the new dungeons at +15 in time.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Artifact Weapon Transmog<br />
You will be able to transmog into your artifact weapons and druid froms in the transmog menu:<br />
<br />
<br />
When transmogging your weapon, there is an option under the weapon type drop down menu called &quot;Artifact Pair.&quot; <br />
When you select this, you see your basic artifact weapon and the different versions and colors of each unlocked weapon.<br />
When you right click the version as a druid, a list of the different forms and color options is able to be selected to apply to your character. The form is still linked to your artifact weapon and so your weapon will appear as the claws or daggers (based on spec) regardless of what weapon you have equipped. (ex - your equipped polearm would still turn into the dual daggers).<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage - Remove Curse (https://beta.wowdb.com/spells/475-remove-curse). Removes all Curses from a friendly target.<br />
<br />
<br />
Loot Changesloot<br />
Moving forward, current content will use Personal Loot and old content will use Legacy Loot mode.<br />
<br />
<br />
All current content will use Personal Loot. Master Loot is gone.<br />
Group and Master Loot puts players at the mercy of others, often in ways that aren't fair. Trial players in a new guild may not get anything for weeks because that is the guild policy.<br />
When you kill a boss, it isn't about if there is something on the corpse that you want, but if someone is going to give you that loot. It disconnects the reward from killing the boss.<br />
Trading restrictions for loot will work the same as they do now for the most part. If it is lower than the highest item level piece you have ever looted and had soulbound for that slot, you can trade it. <br />
Content that is no longer current will utilize Legacy Loot mode, which boosts the amount of loot and allows loot for any class and spec to drop.<br />
Legacy Content occurs when you are 10 levels or more above the maximum level of the content.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Profession Changes professions<br />
<br />
Each profession will now be separated into expansions and leveled separately from one another. <br />
Each expansion will have it's own leveling path for items from that expansion, similar to the Mists of Pandaria cooking. <br />
You can choose to go back and level older expansion crafting, or you can simply level the current expansion. <br />
This allows you to craft items with current expansion materials without needing older expansion materials to level<br />
You can still go back and level older expansion crafting skills as well. <br />
To clarify further, an example of this means that you can level your &quot;Cataclysm Tailoring&quot; by crafting Cataclysm patterns, but this doesn't stop you from progressing your &quot;Kul Tiran / Zandalari Tailoring&quot; with the new expansion's patterns.<br />
First Aid is going away (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7414-Armory-Stats-First-Aid-Court-of-Stars-22-Solo-New-Overwatch-Hero-BfA-CE-Listing) and its patterns are being redistributed into Tailoring and Alchemy. Your First Aid crafts will have to be relearned in their respective new profession.<br />
<br />
<br />
In BfA will we have to relearn crafts from previous expansions?<br />
In Battle for Azeroth, any crafts you’ve learned in the past will still be there and not need to be re-learned, with the exception of First Aid. Tailoring and Alchemy crafts, bandages, and anti-venoms that used to be in First Aid will have to be re-learned.(WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/976599336325754880))<br />
<br />
<br />
Updated PvP Talents System and War ModepvpTalent<br />
PvP Talents and World PvP are significantly changing in this patch:<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP talents are unlocked for everyone as they level, rather than through PvP gameplay.<br />
Players can select three PvP talents from a large pool of options for your spec, including a &quot;PvP Trinket&quot; style talent.<br />
War Mode allows you to toggle on and off World PvP on all realms, removing the distinction between PvE and PvP realms.<br />
War Mode can be toggled on or off in your faction's capital city.<br />
Players will only see other players that have War Mode on if they have it on, or players that have it off if they have it off. <br />
War Mode enables PvP Talents everywhere that PvP can happen and provides 10% bonus XP and rewards from World Quests. (https://beta.wowdb.com/spells/269083-enlisted) <br />
You will only see groups in the Group Finder that contain players who also have War Mode set to the same status that you do.<br />
Honor is account wide and still grants increased Honor Levels, which reward titles, pets, mounts, icons, and more.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
PvP Progression Updates<br />
PvP Progression will receive some significant overhauls in this patch. We've highlighted some of the important points below, but be sure to read the full post (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7715-Battle-for-Azeroth-Preview-PvP-Rating-Updates) for all of the details. <br />
<br />
<br />
Ratings now fall into brackets: Combatant, Challenger, Rival, Duelist, and Gladiator.<br />
Conquest points are back!<br />
Players can earn a specific piece of raid-quality gear each week, adding up to full sets of increasing quality over the course of a season.<br />
Rated play in any bracket (including 2v2) will count toward earning Vicious mounts.<br />
There is a new end-of-the week reward similar to the weekly chests you can earn for doing Mythic Keystone dungeons.<br />
If you’ve filled up your Conquest bar for the week, you’ll receive a reward in the chest. The item level will be based on the highest bracket in which you won at least one game last week.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
PvP Tiers<br />
The prepatch is adding a PvP Tier system for 2v2, 3v3, and RBGs! The listed max rating is likely when you will ascend to the next tier, with the listed min rating for each tier being slightly below when you ascend to that tier to prevent you from dropping back down right away. <br />
<br />
<br />
Unranked: 0 - 1400<br />
Combatant: 1375 - 1600<br />
Challenger: 1575 - 1800<br />
Rival: 1775 - 2100<br />
Duelist: 2075 - 2400<br />
Gladiator: 2375+<br />
<br />
<br />

https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/july/thumb/pvprankicons02.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/july/pvprankicons.jpg) <br />
<br />
<br />
In BfA we are doing some meaningful re-structuring of the PvP itemization system, as well as the ranking system. We're still massaging the system, but we'd like to share some details which may help alleviate some of your concerns. Keep in mind some of this stuff could still change. No pony promises.<br />
<br />
New ranking system<br />
We're updating the ranking system to better mirror the other games at Blizzard. WoW via arena is actually one of the first competitive games at Blizzard to have a rating system, so it's fair to say it's time for an update. <br />
<br />
To that end we want to bucket players in rankings similar to StarCraft or Overwatch using labels such as Gold, Platinum etc. (We're still going to have our own titles (Challenger, Rival, Duelist etc.)) We feel these rankings have grown to common verbage in the competitive PvP community so we're happy to bring them to WoW. Keep in mind that you'll still be able to see your rating at end of match and within the UI. And we're also looking to add your actual rank in the UI as well (as in, you're rank #10 in the region).<br />
<br />
New iLevel reward scheme<br />
Similar as in Legion, we're going to reward you with better gear based upon your competitive standing. However, in Legion we rewarded you incrementally in a linear fashion. So as you gained more rating, your iLevel gradually increased. We found this didn't reflect the distribution of players very fairly in terms of appropriate reward for effort in the system. (Translation: The iLevel of rewards was generally too low) In result we're changing the distribution instead to be something of a bell curve, to match the new ranking system. <br />
<br />
What this means is that players in Challenger/Gold (1600-1800 around) will have a chance at ~Normal raid quality loot, Rival/Platinum (starting around 1800) with Heroic Raid quality loot, and so on.<br />
<br />
Epic Appearances and other rewards<br />
Different rewards will be tied to different rankings. In Legion you got the entire Epic appearance when you hit 2000 rating, in BfA this will be gradually rewarded to you at different ranks. And you will instantly get the look after you achieve that rank, rather than a end of season calculation. <br />
<br />
We totally get the concerns with potentially too broad of brackets. And we definitely agree the competitive spirit often burns brightest at the highest ratings, so it's something we'll be mindful of. Season Gladiator mounts (and likely glad titles) will still be a % distribution at end of season like in the past, and we could see new rewards for the upper brackets as we shift some of the others (Epic appearances) downwards. <br />
<br />
Weekly Conquest<br />
As discussed in the past, we're introducing a conquest system based upon past designs. You will earn conquest from doing PvP activities (mostly rated, but some also from War Mode) that will fill a bar for a reward each week. This is intended to be attractive to the average player. <br />
<br />
One of our biggest goals with the new system is to better align the effort and reward in contrast to all of the other parts of the game, especially at the lower rankings who perhaps in Legion (or in the past) didn't see it as worth their time. I think we can all agree that more players doing competitive PvP is a worthwhile goal.<br />
<br />
We hope to have these systems live in beta soon, and hope to hear your feedback!<br />
<br />
Will there be any incentive to do casual BGs? Perhaps a small daily reward of conquest? New system sounds great otherwise.<br />
Our current thought is you'll get a good chunk of conquest for first win of the day (Normal Battlegrounds as well as Epic Battlegrounds), as well as a little bit for wins.<br />
<br />
<br />
Prestige Converted to Honor Level<br />
You will no longer prestige in the prepatch. The new honor level system goes up to 500. The prestige rewards from Legion are being redistributed among this new cap, but if you already earned them you won't have to grind them again.<br />
<br />

World Quest UI ChangesripWQGF<br />
It will be significantly more effort to group for World Quests due to new restrictions on what addons can do with the Group Finder. <br />
<br />
<br />
The default UI no longer offers the option to find a group for non-elite quests. The option is still there for Elite quests.<br />
Addons can no longer automatically create groups, even with a user pressing the button. The title and description can only be manually filled out.<br />
Users will have to manually add a title and create a group for world quests. You can't even paste text into the fields.<br />
Addons can still search for groups.<br />
<br />

A blizzard dev was a trial in a guild for 3 weeks and didn't get any loot, and this upset him. It was unfair to him that new people in established, highly progressed, mutli-expansion guilds had to prove their ability and loyalty to the guild before getting loot.

<br />
You laugh but that's probably what happens. Sometimes bad things happening to devs &quot;inspires&quot; them to make change moreso than clean, calm forum discussion well ever hope to achieve. Anger almost always is the way to communicate to them and get some kind of response.<br />
<br />
The problem is benevolent dictatorship is great... until they aren't benevolent anymore. In two guilds I got shafted. Since then I only raid with PL because you can't trust raid leaders to be benevolent.<br />
<br />
So a middle ground seems to have been made. If a player genuinely has a real upgrade, they can't trade it. If they do then they can. This prevents the &quot;no, give it to X or you're out of here&quot; problem.<br />
<br />
I've been in two guilds that painfully gave away a very rare mount because a PUG rolled it and it was on ML. Those raid leaders were the kind you trust ML with.<br />
<br />
My uncle is in a guild where he's usually last to get gear because some other asshole keeps saying &quot;but those are my best stats!&quot; on everything up until they realize for my uncle it was like an 890 -&gt; 965 and the other was like a 950 -&gt; 965 or something on a similar scale.<br />
<br />
So I get the change but I also don't doubt it only really happens because the developers got shafted in a guild and got upset too.</div></div><hr />

Every world quest I have done, there have been people there doing the same quest. It is just like being in a group. Oh, and you want to create a group?

You said people were telling others to leave the game. At least provide the exact evidence. You provided one half of it. While I'm not fussed about the WQ change I do agree the Action bar looks way more untidy imo. <br />

I'm not bashing anyone ROFL. <br />
<br />
I asked for evidence. <br />
<br />
I said both sides are as bad as each other. Note how I said BOTH. Note how I wasn't taking sides.<br />
<br />
And yes you have every right to critique a product. Never said otherwise. However you should also expect to have your discussion point debated or critiqued and be prepared for said discussion.<br />
<br />
The people who literally complain for the sake of it are just as bad as those who defend the game like it has no issues. At least read everything that is posted rather than cherry picking to suit your own discussion point.<br />
<br />
The WQ change imo really isn't that drastic. It's two extra clicks at most.<br />
<br />
The ML change is one I disagree with however because it's just removing the freedom of choice under the bs that it affects trial raiders. Why shouldn't a guild be allowed to set their own rules for trial raiders?</div></div><hr />

True, and I thought about that, but still it is much more useful as a Hunter ability be pet ability as MM with LW won’t even have it unless required. Then that becomes a nerf for a dispel which may or may not be required for certain encounters.<br />

There is still a way to push certain roles forward. This will just slow it. But I agree it is a dumbfuck move removing the options groups have to distribute gear. Bottom line, if you don't want to work as a team stay in Looking For Retards, don't whine till you ruin it for others.</div></div><hr />

This is wrong. It was never 2 rows of 10 :/ It always been one row of 12 for the right bottom bar, so only thing they did now (because they pulled out the bags and micro menu from the actionbar stack) was to split that one row of 12 into 2 rows of 6.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, but the pocket pet portal will be available on a vendor now for the new pet charms. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the Final parts of the Balance of Power quest chain, you can now pick up the Quest to acquire the &quot;Eye of Guldan&quot; without having completed the Nightshard gathering quest in the Nighthold. (so you don't have to hearth back to turn in to grab new quest)</div></div><hr />

It was unfair to him that new people in established, highly progressed, mutli-expansion guilds had to prove their ability and loyalty to the guild before getting loot. Trial raiders in top 50 guilds deserve loot day 1 over 3 year veterans.<br />
