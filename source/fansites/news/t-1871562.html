Earlier this year, Carbine announced (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4922-Patch-6-2-Corrupted-Dreadwing-Frostwolf-Helm-Blue-Tweets-Wildstar-Free-to-Play#wsf2p) that Wildstar was moving to a free to play model. That day is finally here! You can find out more (http://www.wildstar-online.com/en/news/2015-05-28-wildstar-is-going-free-to-play-heres-all-you-need-to-know/) about the Free to Play transition or grab the new smaller client (https://twitter.com/derek_delakron/status/648279638377009152) and some addons (http://www.curse.com/ws-addons/wildstar). The Wildstar subreddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/3mqxv4/meta_check_here_first_before_posting_f2p_launch/) also has some helpful links.<br />

The first Guild Wars 2 expansion is only a few weeks away and ArenaNet recently published the launch trailer. Don't forget that they also made the base game free to play with some restrictions (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5118-Timewarped-Badge-Rewards-September-2-Hotfixes-Tweets-GW2-Base-Game-Free-to-Play#gw2f2p) recently as well. Guild week (https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/welcome-to-guild-week/) starts on Tuesday, with information on the new guild features coming in Heart of Thorns.<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
If you're in Ashran, we think it's okay to bring 4 friends along with you. But bringing 39 creates an unfair environment. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/646509965465616384))<br />
Certainly happy that new communities have sprung up and new friendships have been formed. But not at the expense of fairplay. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/646510398091362304))<br />
Unfortunately, a few people have circumvented those restrictions and we've had to create additional measures. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/646510211453194240))<br />
I am not sure I understand. So working together as a team is frowned upon in an MMO?<br />
Seems like you're twisting my words. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/646511254761160704))<br />
<br />
Why no just remove the (Ashran) debuff from the game? take less code hrs, Please?<br />
We think it's important that all players that enter Ashran have an equal opportunity to compete. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/646509604638035968))<br />
idk if you've been to ashran but they all seem extremely one sided, mostly in favor of alliance<br />
I receive an equal number of &quot;Horde always wins&quot; and &quot;Alliance always wins&quot; complaints. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/646511506725535744))<br />

<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
which is sad. Player insight into the the why's of development is great, makes the decisions feel less arbitrary<br />
Exactly. So maybe let's give up on the whole petition to get someone fired strategy. (Autocorrect said &quot;furred&quot; lol.) (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/646129772163043328))<br />
<br />
If you aren’t controversial, either you’re a puppet or you do nothing important.<br />
That may be the case, but some companies view social media as a distraction, so being controversial is a net loss. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/646163229723353088))<br />

<br />
IDK how GW2 does their endgame but WoW endgame is a poo too. There's PvP and PvE, both can consist of many things. Blizzard's endgame for PvE is Raids. Professions, quests, reputations, exploration, and everything else all take a back seat to beating up some random boss.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Anything they do now is just to keep people in there longer than need be. Like the debuff if you leave early. They don't try to do any balancing, and if they mention it, it's because someone brought it up in a tweet, making Holinka shrug it off and say &quot;If we do this, then xyz happens.&quot;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormykitten</div><div class="date">2015-09-29, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gw2 is not changing model as such, they are just moving the cost for the full game to the Heart of Thorns expansion. So the vanilla client is a free trial, and a very nice trial at that. It's like how Wow bakes previous games into one purchase, except only for the expansion in GW2's case. anyway, it's really fun to play on the side for me, I really enjoy some of it and you don't feel the need to get your money's worth.<br />

How embarrassing, your ignorance is showing :P<br />

GW2 doesn't have raids. And the game has received overwhelmingly more PvE updates and support then it has PvP.<br />

He just praised GW1 as legendary, while putting down GW2. Something I starkly disagree with since I thought GW1 was mediocre and GW2 great, but if you were to identify him as any sort of &quot;fanboy&quot; based on his post, it would be a GW1 fanboy not a Blizz fanboy.</div></div><hr />

GW2 is in a good spot, once they start pumping out content again post-expansion release then I'd like the &quot;no endgame&quot; people to eat their hats.</div></div><hr />

How many fucking wipes hasn't occured in hfc because dumbasses barrage?<br />
<br />
This. The stereotype exists for a reason. I'm sick of wiping cause of tards that can't handle barrage. The moonkin tards with starfall are right behind them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although it's sad that Barrage is still the go-to talent for its tier. I try to be careful with not hitting extra mobs on my hunter alt, but there are some situations where you're much better off not even using that ability. (And really, would you bother to change out the talent for trash?) I miss using Glaive Toss, wish it could compete with Barrage. :(</div></div><hr />

We're removing more and more social aspects of WoW by the patch and hotfix -- it's getting laughable.<br />
What WAS supposed to feel like &quot;world pvp at its finest&quot; is, literally, no different than a shit ball alterac valley with longer queues and different rewards.<br />
<br />
So now we end up with, basically, a new BG. Nothing else.<br />
<br />
Why don't they just make Ashran a BG and move on with life?</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be fair, it's REALLY hard to gauge how wide of an area that happens.<br />
<br />
It's like the Shaman's that pulled add's if they used Nova in BRF. They had *no idea* it would pull the downstairs add's from upstairs.<br />
<br />
Imagine if paladins had their conc tripled or quadrupled. They'd be pulling a lot as well.<br />
<br />
Now huntards have their name because right-click autoshot as well as not turning taunts off. THAT is where the stereotype started.<br />
Warlocks don't have this because they have only one pet made for tanking and they often know this whereas hunters don't. Pretty much ANY pet tank now since they can spec any pet how they want.<br />
<br />
As a tank and healer, I don't heal pets that taunt *unless* the hunter is helping the tank for some reason (e.g. tank is undergeared, tank is about to die, whatever).</div></div><hr />

He used to be okay when he would respond to the most stupid comments you could ever think of. But now he treats everyone as equally stupid, alienating the player base who asks LEGIT questions. Hell why even respond to the stupid comments, respond to the thoughtful ones that actually pertain to something.<br />
<br />
I don't think it matters who or what he responds to. Everyone thinks they're the thoughtful ones with comments that pertain to something. And, invariably, someone agrees with them and complains that the guy didn't get a response...</div></div><hr />

Erm because its called MMO-Champion and not WoW champion?. Also there's sometimes news on other MMOs and other forums. Yes it originated as a WoW news site but why shouldn't they post info on other MMO's?</div></div><hr />

You know it is always funny when someone says this site isn't WoW-Champion when it is technically is, you could say it is Blizz-Champion. You only see news for other games when their is no WoW news. There is not way to sugar coat it, people just need to accept it until Curse or Chaud / Boub change the direction of the site it will always be WoW news first &amp; other news when their is a slow news day or no news so they throw something up to cover the day. Like today their is Hearthstone &amp; Heroes. if you want news about other MMOs go to others sites for that.</div></div><hr />

Or we could come here as along with WoW news there are other game subforums amongst off topic and tv for example? If you don't want to read the news that is other MMO's fine but don't expect it to be WoW 24-7</div></div><hr />

<br />
But it is 24/7 though, regardless if you want other news it takes the back seat when their is WoW news. It is nice when other stuff comes up, but it is only their because their is no WoW news to cover the day.</div></div><hr />
