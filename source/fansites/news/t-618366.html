11:30 AM - The biggest announcement of the Opening Ceremony was the new Diablo 3 Class - The Wizard (Youthful and headstrong, the upstart Wizard manipulates the primal forces of the universe to vanquish foes.), nothing really new for WoW and we'll have to wait for the panels. <br />
<br />
Class Panel<br />
Dual-Spec system<br />
The dual-spec system will be introduced in a content patch. The goal is to let you switch specs very easily in raid, even between fights ! However it won't be possible to switch specs in the middle of an arena match. <br />
With dual-spec introduced in the game, there are also discussions about an Itemrack-like mod being introduced to the default UI<br />
<br />
Group Flexibility<br />
There are 30 specs but only 25 spots in a raid. The class choice should be very flexible and the buff/debuff system overhaul was done to help with that. Cancelling a buff because a class wasn't available (like Shamans for Bloodlust) was not desirable. <br />
Most buffs now affect the whole raid and multiple classes can give them, however none of them will stack. You should get more types of buffs by bringing a fewer number of players and will be able to optimize them by bringing the right spec but it definitely won't be as necessary as it was in TBC. (Note : See Raidcomp (http://raidcomp.mmo-champion.com) !)<br />
<br />
Tanking<br />
All the tanking classes are now suitable as a main tank and their threat has been greatly increased to make fights more fun, fights are now more about skills than dying because of a random aggro. <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=650) / Talent Calc. (9061) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?deathknight))<br />
The original idea behind the rune system was a totally customizable rune pool (like, 6 Unholy runes) but &quot;it sucked&quot;. They changed it to what is it today (2 Runes of each type)<br />
Death Knights shouldn't be played like a metronome and is intended to be an interactive and reactive class.<br />
As a death knight, your talent trees are a good way to define &quot;your style, but not your role&quot;. Devs want to bring this philosophy to other classes.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=700) / Talent Calc. (9061) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?druid))<br />
Balance druids have been greatly improved and you shouldn't see a lot of OOMkins anymore. Their DPS is now on par with other DPS classes.<br />
Balance DPS looks pretty good now but developpers are keeping an eye on the survavibility<br />
Entangling roots was allowed indoor to give druids more crowd control ability in instances.<br />
Restoration were stuck in the HoT niche and were very limited in 5-mans or raids. Nourish is new flash heal-like spell added to solve this problem on single targets and Wild Growth was added to give them an AOE Heal. <br />
Druids were also given an OOC resurrection spell.<br />
Feral druids were decent at tanking and DPSing, but couldn't master any of these fields. In WotLK you can take all the bear talents to become a very good main tank, or all the cat talents to have a very high DPS. <br />
Feral mana is a known issue, and developpers don't want intellect on feral gear. This is being looked at<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=620) / Talent Calc. (9061) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?hunter))<br />
The hunter pet system was overhauled because it was &quot;clumsy for new players&quot;.<br />
The shot rataion has been cleaned to make things easier for hunters and make them less reliant on mods or macros.<br />
Freezing shot was introduced to make pulls faster without having to deploy your traps on the ground each time. <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=670) / Talent Calc. (9061) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?mage))<br />
Frostfire Bolt is a way to achieve an elemental tree with mages, they should be able to deal both fire and frost damage<br />
Mage DPS looks pretty good now, there are still a few mana issues getting fixed very soon<br />
Living Bomb base damage will most likely be increased and the spell mechanics might be modified slightly. Overall, the 51-points talent weren't meant to be spammed and developpers want them to be situational<br />
Frost and Fire looks pretty balanced now, but Arcane needs a few more tweaks. Arcane needs to be more &quot;mobile&quot;<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=610) / Talent Calc. (9061) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?paladin))<br />
Paladins were decent off-tanks but not great main tanks, this is fixed in WotLK. Paladins should focus on protection gear instead of spell power. <br />
Holy Paladins were good healers but couldn't do much in encounters where players are required to move a lot, however they definitely don't want them as a HoT class.<br />
Retribution paladins are supposed to deal a decent amount of DPS without running out of mana. <br />
Retributions paladins have to be in control of their damage and shouldn't have to rely on lucky critical strikes to deal most of their damage<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=640) / Talent Calc. (9061) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?priest))<br />
The goal with Shadowpriest is to make them a DPS class, not just a mana battery. <br />
Discipline priests should be viable raid healer.<br />
Mind sear was introduced to give priests another viable DPS ability.<br />
Class-specific racial abilities were cool, but the idea became got &quot;old&quot; with time. That's why racials have been revamped<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=630) / Talent Calc. (9061) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?rogue))<br />
AoE DPS was really needed and Fan of Knives was added to the game. <br />
Purchasable poisons and the buff of the dagger spec should help &quot;reintroducing&quot; them to the game. <br />
The goal is to have end-boss less immune to poisons and rogues less dependant of Windfury<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=660) / Talent Calc. (9061) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?shaman))<br />
Totems are now physical and harder to dispell, have more life and last longer. <br />
Hex was added to give Shamans more crowd control ability, Riptide to improve their healing, and Lava Burst their spell DPS.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=680) / Talent Calc. (9061) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?warlock))<br />
Warlocks pets have been made more useful.<br />
The warlock rotation shouldn't be restricted to a shadowbolt spam, that's why Chaos Bolt was added.<br />
Affliction Tree is still too complicated and developpers are working on it. Developers definitely want it back as a raiding spec <br />
Pets should be easier to summon/switch and use.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=600) / Talent Calc. (9061) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?warrior))<br />
Protection spec has been revamped to make it cooler to play, mitigation talents now take a lot less points and will let you invest in a few other nice tools. <br />
In TBC, Arms was PvP and Fury the PvE spec, this will change in WotLK : Battle Stance, Overpower, and Rend have been improved. New fun abilities have been introduced like Bladestorm and Sudden Death, Fury obviously have Titan's Grip.<br />
<br />

UI Panel<br />
Nothing really interesting here, but a few things answered during the Q&amp;A. If you're really interested in everything check the transcript on WoWInsider (http://www.wowinsider.com/2008/10/10/blizzcon-2008-ui-panel-liveblog/).<br />
There were plans to make the backpack bigger, but the currency and pet changes in WotLK freed enough space and there isn't any plan to do it anymore. Still possible for the future though.<br />
There is going to be a dual-spec interface introduced in a content patch after the expansion. The talent spec process will be revisited at the same time. (Confirmation boxes to prevent misplaced talents, etc ...)<br />
The compatibility of TBC addons in WotLK shouldn't be too bad at the beginning. There wasn't any huge LUA change or anything like that.<br />
There isn't any plan to add class-specific elements like PallyPower in the default UI. Sometimes very popular addons might be integrated to the base UI but only when they fit general needs. <br />
There are no current plans to change the bag UI and make it just one large bag. <br />
A /castrandom command for the new Mounts/Minipets UI might be added to the game. <br />
Itemrack and ingame boss mods are still planned, but there is no ETA on them. <br />
The current implementation of the threat UI (% of threat of the main tank) in the beta is the final one. The point of the default UI is to be simple and very visual, for more detailed stats you'll have to rely on specific mods like Omen.<br />
<br />
<br />
The pictures below are early beta of the achievement UI, and a few explanations on how things works during development. <br />

<br />
Great idea except for a few things. Like cooldowns, wanting to remove mobs from AoE zones, wanting to build agro on mobs before trapping so they chase us rather than healers between traps and the fact we now have a guaranteed pulling shot. It's simply too situational to be worth the slot :/</div></div><hr />

Canceling a raid because &lt;class&gt; wasn't avaliable.<br />

And sure, they've fixed it for 25 mans. For 10 mans? It's considerably worse than before because there's only a few ways to correctly stack them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But not really.<br />
<br />
30 TREES (31 if you count feral druids), 25 raid slots.<br />
<br />
Now which of those trees (deeper than 31 points) are not suitable for raiding at this point in time?<br />
<br />
Hunter: Survival<br />
Rogue: Sub<br />
Mage: Arcane<br />
DK: Unholy (let's face it, it's a trick tree - lots of fun to play but no real group utility save for your bubble)<br />
Warlock: Demonology (deep demonology is a joke for real DPS and has no raid-unique buffs, and you know it)<br />
Druid: Feral cat (the numbers just don't impress me. they STILL don't scale properly)<br />
<br />
So look at that. So long as you leave the idiot-specs at home, you have 25 players.<br />

Nothing really new has been announced. Instead it all seems like a big summary of already known stuff with a developers commentary.<br />
Where are the big OHHHs and AHHHs?<br />
I know they are very close to release but I really thought they kept some last big secret like an amazingly cool dual spec feature. But even that is coming post-release and no details yet. :-\</div></div><hr />

The goal is to let you switch specs very easily in raid, even between fights ! However it won't be possible to switch specs in the middle of an arena match.<br />
* With dual-spec introduced in the game, there are also discussions about an Itemrack-like mod being introduced to the default UI<br />
<br />
Blizz posts so yes you will be able to switch on the fly. Not just in combat or arena!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
There isn't any plan to add class-specific elements like PallyPower in the default UI. Sometimes very popular addons might be integrated to the base UI but only when they fit general needs.<br />
<br />
Keep your paladin bloat to yourselves!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stupid11</div><div class="date">2008-10-11, 08:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=680) / Talent Calc. (9061) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?warlock))<br />
Warlocks pets have been made more useful.<br />
The warlock rotation shouldn't be restricted to a shadowbolt spam, that's why Chaos Bolt was added.<br />
Affliction Tree is still too complicated and developpers are working on it. Developers definitely want it back as a raiding spec <br />
Pets should be easier to summon/switch and use.<br />
<br />
<br />
Chaos Bolt is the least of Destro's rotation problems. The problem is they're forcing gimmicky PVP spells that have always sucked, and still do, onto us. Sacrificing good damage for bad damage just for a boost to that good damage (Backdraft) is NOT going to work.<br />
<br />
And we weren't &quot;restricted&quot; to Shadowbolt spam, it was just superior to other things.<br />
<br />
Why do they only work on Affliction when it's currently the highest DPS tree we have? WTF? HELLO DEMO? Anyone even remember this tree is there? Destro isn't much better off in terms of DPS talents (DPS itself is respectable, but it's enormously complicated, self-defeating, and all of our high level talents just boost Immolate and Conflag. DPS TALENTS though, need a major rework. Utility/Fun/PVP talents are fine-ish.)<br />
<br />
Also, how the fuck are pets easier to summon OR switch? ? ? ? We've had ABSOLUTELY ZERO CHANGES to pet summoning. Locks are going to be FUCKED by boss abilities that target a random person. BAM, pet gets 1 shot, lock either gimps himself for the rest of the fight or spends 10 seconds doing nothing and recasting his pet.<br />
<br />
The ONLY SPEC in pve that will get any pet summoning improving talents is deep Demo, our worst tree. Honestly, it's going to be worse than in TBC because all Destro raiders could get the 6 second default summon and Fel Dom for a .5 second summon. 80% AOE only avoidance does NOT FIX having a 10 second resummon.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Puffy</div><div class="date">2008-10-11, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Chaos Bolt is the least of Destro's rotation problems. The problem is they're forcing gimmicky PVP spells that have always sucked, and still do, onto us. Sacrificing good damage for bad damage just for a boost to that good damage (Backdraft) is NOT going to work.<br />
<br />
And we weren't &quot;restricted&quot; to Shadowbolt spam, it was just superior to other things.<br />
<br />
Why do they only work on Affliction when it's currently the highest DPS tree we have? WTF? HELLO DEMO? Anyone even remember this tree is there? Destro isn't much better off in terms of DPS talents (DPS itself is respectable, but it's enormously complicated, self-defeating, and all of our high level talents just boost Immolate and Conflag. DPS TALENTS though, need a major rework. Utility/Fun/PVP talents are fine-ish.)<br />
<br />
Also, how the fuck are pets easier to summon OR switch? ? ? ? We've had ABSOLUTELY ZERO CHANGES to pet summoning. Locks are going to be FUCKED by boss abilities that target a random person. BAM, pet gets 1 shot, lock either gimps himself for the rest of the fight or spends 10 seconds doing nothing and recasting his pet.<br />
<br />
The ONLY SPEC in pve that will get any pet summoning improving talents is deep Demo, our worst tree. Honestly, it's going to be worse than in TBC because all Destro raiders could get the 6 second default summon and Fel Dom for a .5 second summon. 80% AOE only avoidance does NOT FIX having a 10 second resummon.<br />
<br />
<br />
Typical flavor of the month reroller.<br />
<br />
Take a look at the new skills, the new playstyles and the beta forums and your questions will be answered regarding better switching between pets, how Destro works.<br />

Oh and the Starcraft thing is that Starcraft II will be a trilogy (for the single player campaigns only, the multiplayer will be full at release) with the Terran campaign coming first, then Zerg then Protoss. Also, Blizzcon 2008 beta keys will be used for Starcraft II (time not yet announced, Mike just said it wasn't ready yet). They showed the newer campaign interface and it was interesting, but to be honest, I'd have to try it as it's a lot different than the fairly linear mission mode that Starcraft has right now (there were very few branches that you could take by completing a mission differently in the original). But it looks like the trilogy idea was good, as from what they showed of the single player terran campaign... all of the in-game cinematics and stuff being done for all three races would've kept the game from coming out for awhile. Although, personally I would've wanted Protoss first myself :P.<br />
<br />
Oh and as to the comment on Lightning Bolt, if I remember correctly, GC said they actually wanted to tone down LB a bit, but decided against it, because it'd hurt Elemental too much at this current point (as you don't get Lava Burst until 75). <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
DK: Unholy (let's face it, it's a trick tree - lots of fun to play but no real group utility save for your bubble)<br />
<br />
Absolutely not true. Unholy is actually a fantastic tree overall for either tanking, PVE or PVP. Unholy excels a bit when it comes to AoE tanking and it has a few good tanking talents. The real tree that could use some work is Blood. It's good for DPS, but when it comes down to it, Blood's lower-in-the-tree tanking talent is supposedly Vampiric Blood, which simply raises the amount of healing you receive by 50%... not exactly great for mitigation compared to Bone Armor (Unholy) and Unbreakable Armor (Frost). Unholy's DPS is also pretty darned good.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't like the idea to swich specs between fights. The Spec switching is a good idea but not between fights. kinda weird <br />
<br />
<br />
It's a great idea for some classes. Take Karazhan for example... you only need two tanks on a couple encounters and some trash... but the rest of the time, they're literally a wasted spot (except for some niche things like a Paladin assisting on Maiden or whatever). This way, the Paladin could change to Ret or Holy and not have to incur a possibly steep price for it to possibly have to switch back for say... certain Opera encounters.<br />
<br />
For some classes, it might not be a big deal between fights or whatever, but it does help the fact that for some... the 50g amount might add up over time for those that like to do PVE on some days and PVP on others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Uh, no. I'm in beta, I already skim the forums regularly. I've done real testing of this stuff at 80.<br />
<br />
NOTE: I SAID CHAOS BOLT WAS FINE. That's the exact opposite of 2-2-2-2-2 (you're a moron if you bind shadowbolt to 2, imo). I'm FINE with keeping dots up and using Chaos Bolt on cooldown. (If you want to play a class that spammed 2-2-2-2-2-2 in BC and will STILL spam 2-2-2-2-2-2 in Wrath, roll a mage.)<br />
<br />
The PROBLEM is Conflag, Backdraft, and the second effect of Fire &amp; Brimstone. They're all awful mechanics and talents.<br />
<br />
And no, there haven't been any pet changing improvements. O wise one, please point out these amazing changes. A new interface =/= easier pet changing. You're a moron if you didn't know what each pet did/had a hotkey for the important ones. Oh, you can't? Too bad.<br />
<br />
And buffs to the pets themselves ARE NOT THE SAME AS EASIER SWITCHING. Just because you're using one pet instead of saccing doesn't mean it's easier to resummon or go to a different one now.</div></div><hr />

Change boss to not target pets.<br />
Done.</div></div><hr />

So what button do you bind shadowbolt to? Or are you one of those loser clickers? I prefer the 3 button for mine.</div></div><hr />

Protection spec has been revamped to make it cooler to play, mitigation talents now take a lot less points and will let you invest in a few other nice tools. <br />
In TBC, Arms was PvP and Fury the PvE spec, this will change in WotLK : Battle Stance, Overpower, and Rend have been improved. New fun abilities have been introduced like Bladestorm and Sudden Death, Fury obviously have Titan's Grip.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What exactly was changed here? with mitigation talents, which ones do they mean more specifically? all the 5p talents for shieldblock, armor value etc down to 3p rather than 5p or what?</div></div><hr />

Right this seems random. Where is the source for this confirmation? I have been looking around since i saw this and found no other mention of a confirmation that it is a new universe or that there will be information at any period 'before a while'.<br />
<br />
Where did you confirm this boubouille? I love mmo but this just sticks out as inaccurate.</div></div><hr />
