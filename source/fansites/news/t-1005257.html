Blizzcon Interview Details<br />
A few interviews of Blizzard staff have popped up so far, the interesting parts are below. We are likely to see more early next week. (via venturebeat (http://venturebeat.com/2011/10/22/blizzard-coo-paul-sams-talks-mobile-games-and-giving-away-diablo-iii-for-free/), gaming-insight (http://www.gaming-insight.de/wow/538-Blizzcon-2011-Live-Video-Opening-Ceremony-and-Interview-mit-Greg-Ghostcrawler-Street&amp;usg=ALkJrhg9cQ3K86t2RM6AzJN4IzusMY4RpA))<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You might be able to use Valor Points to increase the item level of your items slightly.<br />
Blizzard might move your Resource bars closer to the center of the screen, similar to how many custom UIs are set up. It will start with Monks, then maybe Paladins and Death Knights.<br />
The game will almost always be sold with Burning Crusade in the future to cut down on the number of games you have to buy.<br />
If WoW was ever on the decline to where subscriptions were not high enough to support the game, they would consider the freemium model. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
So a tauren warrior doing blade storm is silly too? - because that looks quite similar to the panda doing the spinning crane kick.. The class looks awesome for me, mainly because its so different from your usual classes - would of been disappointing if they just brought out another class that just swings, or cast at range. This class seems so active ( the melee dps aspect ) and from the sounds of it, the healing sounds really active, instead of just sitting back and casting the same spell over and over again until a spike of damage..<br />
<br />
Just try and wait until more info is release before making your final judgement - i pity the people who have been saying this weekend that they are quitting or not continuing their subscription - they are the real ones missing out. <br />
<br />
CAN'T WAIT TO BE A PANDA!</div></div><hr />

I'm going to guess your 13, lived through pokemon and haven't grown up. The fact that u use tauren warrior as an example is pretty fail tbh. The warrior class is known for its ruthless bloodthirsty berserker nature. Bladestorm is pretty vicious if you ask me, even if the animation is kinda silly. The reputation alone just tells you how serious the warrior is. Panda bears spinning around in stance of the drunken ox is silly. It's not a fighting monster like the tauren is. The people missing out are the ones who still play this game. But then again, they missed out years ago when WoW was in vanilla/BC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BC is now free when u purchase vanilla. They probably mean the disk will automatically come with BC on it at no additional cost. Currently, I THINK, you have to download it online after u purchase vanilla. It's still free though, just an extra step.</div></div><hr />

For the moment the pandaren models look extremely funny and ridiculous, the monk's animations look retarded as well and anyone stating the opposite is blind or an extremely biased fanboy. But since it is not even alpha me thinks that in the end they will make the new race the best when it comes to animation and models.</div></div><hr />

Well I guess I got them +50 points then<br />

This entire expansion is just Blizzard stealing other games ideas, because they can't come up with anything anymore. I mean how the hell are they going to have an expansion with no main villain ? plus the animations look retarded as hell.<br />

<br />
Here's what it's referencing from the interview:<br />
<br />
<br />
VB: A lot of massively multiplayer online (MMO) games are experimenting with a “freemium” model and finding varying degrees of success. Obviously, World of Warcraft is not sinking. It doesn’t need to do the DC Universe Online thing where it’s like, “Oh, we’re free to play now, let’s hope this saves us.” But what’s Blizzard’s stance on the freemium pricing model? Do you see it as a viable option for an existing or future game?<br />
<br />
PS: It’s a very interesting business model and approach. Whether or not we will end up doing that at some point or not, I don’t really have the information to share. But certainly it’s possible that could happen with an existing product that we have. I think what you tend to see is that happening when games are on a decline or they don’t have a user base that can support itself through subscriptions. So then they’ll introduce the new model in hopes of being able to generate a different type of revenue to support that community and ongoing content. So it certainly is possible, if we find ourselves in that circumstance, or if we come up with a game where we think that’s the right business model, the most appropriate for players to experience it. We don’t have any opposition to the concept, it’s just that at this point we haven’t decided to make a game where that is the model. But that doesn’t mean that we won’t.<br />
<br />
They meant to use 'freemium' not 'premium.'</div></div><hr />

For the moment the pandaren models look extremely funny and ridiculous, the monk's animations look retarded as well and anyone stating the opposite is blind or an extremely biased fanboy. But since it is not even alpha me thinks that in the end they will make the new race the best when it comes to animation and models.<br />
<br />
This comment is all over the place and sounds like the faux-philosophical nonsense I see in these forums everyday. What are you trying to say, exactly? That others shouldn't judge a book by it's cover until they've seen it? No, that can't be it because then you go on to make a glaring personal opinion and then follow that up with an attack on those who don't share said opinion. AND THEN you say it'll all work out in the end and they'll be awesome?! Did 3 different people write your comment are do you just have multiple personality disorder?<br />
<br />
ANYWAY - I feel bad for the haters bashing on the Pandarians. These obviously didn't see the Animation/Art panel. If they did, they would know that the animations for the Pandarian are 10x more involved than any race before it and actually use -brand spanking new- engine tech for said animations. They can stretch and expand like a physics based object relative to their animation - This is brand new to WoW! They are also the first characters to receive the new &quot;cosmetic&quot; do-dads: their belt has custom physics-based animation. Palladin's will receive librams, Hunters will get an ammo pouch/quiver, Warlocks might get chains, etc. <br />
<br />
Personally, I felt like I was watching a Pixar animated character in a WoW setting and, to me, that is just awesome! The expressiveness of the model and the fluidity of the animation involved in it is a huge game changer for WoW and I'm really glad they talked about going back and re-doing the classic models after having added the new tech to the Pandaren.<br />

As a follow-up, don't base your Monk animation opinion on the small clip on the front page. They showed the animation in action, in detail, at the Art panel and I personally think they'll look just fine on other races. Now, the models themselves need the work-up and will probably get a rigging job to make sure they animate well in the short term, but long-term, it'll all work out.</div></div><hr />

I have no issue with the Pandas, they've been in the game before, and they look fun as hell. Back in 2004/2005 when we were clearing Stratholme live side, we've always asked Blizzard for a Monk class, and here they are finally delivering it.It may look stupid to a lot of people, but to me it looks like fun. I'm actually sort of excited for this expansion. While I'm probably not going to return 100% with the info they've given right now, by time it releases it should have my full attention.In short: If you're crying about Pandas or Monks then boo hoo. It's a game, and the zones from Mists of Pandaria look awesome with nice ambience. The Pandas look kind of silly but no one forces you to play one.Have fun boycotting a video game, I'm sure you could put that on your bucket list.</div></div><hr />

Probably because the Pandarians look so bad. They just look too silly. Sorry, I doubt very seriously I would feel threatened by one. They need to be much more aggressive looking as they appear to be fat slobs... so instead of Thundercats HO! we can have Pedobears OH!</div></div><hr />

You can take in 230 BILLION dollars each month, but if your operating costs are 229,999,999,999 per month, then you have profits of ONE dollar. Do you know how much it takes to pay employee salaries, operating costs at the Blizzard campus, server maintenance, R&amp;D, and pay for all the tech needed to make games/features? If you do, please tell us all so we can be as informed as you. If not, then don't make judgement calls on what a company can and cannot afford. Secondly, as has been noted many times, Pandaren have been in the Warcraft universe far longer than Kung Fu Panda has been in theaters.<br />
<br />
Also, I don't get this whole panda=cute business. Sure, the videos you see on-line of pandas doing adorable shit are cool and all, but a panda in the wild is not something you want to mess with. Judging by the models and previews shown, there is very little cute about the Pandaren outside them standing around aimlessly in a kimono.<br />
<br />
Moving on to the whole recycled content...only Naxx and Zul'aman were actually reused, every other item on your list only shares a likeness in name with its previous incarnation. You can also post negative comments about Blizzard on their forums...as long as you actually know how to form sentences and paragraphs and aren't just spouting off hate speech with no cohesive thought process.<br />
<br />
I agree with one thing you wrote though, but I doubt you actually meant to write it that way: I don't see why 5 million people would unsub for MoP, I really don't. I've tried getting addicted to other games, I really have, but all other MMOs just end up trying too hard to be a prettier WoW and they flounder worse than...a flounder. Anyway, since I planned on playing for 12 months anyway, I do enjoy the fact that Blizzard is giving me something in return.</div></div><hr />

Everybody has the right to say what he thinks about the changes, atleast everyone who knows what he is talking about, and by know what he talks about doenst mean he talks using ur words.<br />
<br />
you cant tell people to leave or stay because they didnt or liked the changes, we are not living in retarded ages. This is not ur own fourm to prevent people from saying what they feel about thoes changes. Freedom of speach exists anywhere so ..... !</div></div><hr />

In my eyes, wow has totally lost every bit of it's seriousness. Really, there's this cataclysm,thousands dying,thousands suffering, and there's this colourful childish shit that looks like kung-fu panda for 8-year olds. <br />
This video just made me not want MoP anymore, considering i did want to try it out on release.<br />

Words of wisdom you forum god you! I totally agree and strongly suggest everyone quit there bitching and just enjoy the game. I highly doubt Blizzard is not going to see you all comment on certain key things within the next expansion that you want changed or unchanged. It hasn't come out yet, and they still have plenty to do with it. So to reiterate. Please quit your bitching and wait for the outcome.</div></div><hr />

It looks like a crappy Kung Fu movie, sounds like a crappy Kung Fu movie, fights like a crappy Kung Fu movie. I feel really bad for &quot;that Chinese dude&quot; in Blizzard that has to come up with all these crappy Americanized &quot;Asian flare&quot;. How about actually spending some time research real Chinese martial art styles and choreography instead of using your favorite movie from when you were 13 years old? and stop making it sounds like he step on a freaking chicken every time he moves. Otherwise I can guarantee that Bliz will lose BOTH the Asian market and Western market.</div></div><hr />

A truly epic Blizzard PR exercise that is working better than they probably expected.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maerad</div><div class="date">2011-10-23, 08:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You all have to be kidding me. If you actually like this garbage you are so blind with fanoi-ism its not even funny. The class is an obvious &quot;fuck you Bioware&quot; I mean come on their &quot;Jab&quot; ability generates &quot;light force&quot; and &quot;dark force&quot;. AND the class has no auto attack. This entire expansion is just Blizzard stealing other games ideas, because they can't come up with anything anymore. I mean how the hell are they going to have an expansion with no main villain ? plus the animations look retarded as hell.<br />
<br />
The mainvillian will be the horde vs. alliance fight - guess there will be a bit more pvp over the board. The new class ... well, I wouldn't say they STOLE something, it's just the OTHER companies &quot;stole&quot; their ideas from chinese/japanese tradion/fights, and there, blizzard gets it's inspiration too.<br />
<br />
Light and Dark represtens the Yin and Yang, the fighting without autoattack makes sense too, if you want the class to be something like a street fighter system. <br />
<br />
If you really break it down, every company stole from the other one - no differences. And if blizzard implents some fighting styles from other games into their - np with that.<br />
<br />
I mean, capture the flag (warsong), hold the point etc. games came from 1st person shooters. But nobody cried back then, that blizzard copied that stuff ;)<br />
<br />
And btw. what would YOUR idea for a new class be? Just asking because of the &quot;can't come up with something new&quot; - that is really hard, because theres already every kind of fightingaspect on the market. If not in a blizzard game, then in another mmo. Hard to come up with something new then.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alexsabou</div><div class="date">2011-10-23, 08:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't mind that it has no main storyline, it is a filler expac after all. It has a neutral feel to it unlike all the other expansions with a main enemy who's out to destroy the world. We are getting 5 levels to recover from the Lich King and Deathwing until the next 10 level expansion. I think blizz will also use it to redeem itself for the lackluster PvP of Cata. And for those complaining about the asian theme, to me it looks like it's more based on asian art and mangas than on actual chinese tradition, which suits WoW well because it's a cartoonish game in the first place.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jmp</div><div class="date">2011-10-23, 08:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think this class could be really cool, but it looks like they're going really strong on stereotypes... If you look at druids, they're wiccan inspired but you wouldn't really know it. Monks are too asian inspired, just way over the top. I hope they don't blend different asian cultures together and instead take inspiration from just one. It'll make it less cliche. I dunno. I know they are basing this of asian culture, but I'm pretty sure martial arts don't teach you to pirouette.<br />

<br />
I also hope they study martial arts and make each stance similar to a specific martial art... off the top of my head I know the racial is based off dim mak, but I dunno if that was intended or not. I hope the stances are based off distinct forms though. I would hate if they keep going for this martial art movie type direction instead of actually studying asian culture.</div></div><hr />

<br />
why should they look badass? pandarian are themed after pandas, some of the laziest animals alive<br />
that would just be wrong<br />
<br />
and to all the MoP haters out there:<br />
und why not a expansion with more fun parts? cata, too, had these, in form of the goblin lvl 1-20 regions and some other parts. <br />
u don´t have to play a pandarian, u can. und if u see them? does that really matter to anyone if they kill a panda but don´t like the lore about them? <br />
these people didn´t scream, when bloodelfs joined the horde, they rerolled a horde b11 after they played allianz till then. and when they could choose between worgen and goblin, they rerolled a worgen on allianz side. and now they cannot choose because there is only one new class and they start whining about it....<br />
<br />
and for the monk class, sure there will be some who like this class, and some, who don´t. if u don´t like it, don´t play it. u have the choice. has allways been so and will allways be so.<br />
<br />
<br />
and if that isn´t compromiss enough, quit this game, so many people would be happy about that...</div></div><hr />

You realize the drunken style is an actual martial arts style right? You should check out Jackie Chan's film, Drunken Master sometime. These aren't all just names that Blizz dreams up, they are based on actual history. Personally I can't wait to play a drunk panda who punches his way through enemies, It sounds awesome.<br />
<br />
Also, Why the hate on the kick animation? I think it's awesome, just like Ryu's hurricane kick from Street fighter. I hope we get a Shoryuken also :D</div></div><hr />

Plate panda warrior with 100% food buff.. TITS!<br />
<br />
everyone stuck on this panda monk thing, leather, table top hat... Ever wonder what the tier set will look like on them? how about we wait and see other models that come up besides the LvL 1 model, and then base ur opinions then.... Because I can imagine what the servers are doing now on the MMO-Chmp server. its screaming &quot;make them stop&quot;!<br />
<br />
its annoying, so people hate it, others like it. Why fight about it... Kinda silly; Dont ya think?<br />

If people would know a bit about the thing it's originated from, you'll find its not that weird at all. Kung Fu is inspired by animal behavior among other things.<br />
Drunken style is a way within the path of the monkey. So yeah it is not an ox, but the combination aint that weird at all. Animal + a way. Same goes for spinning crane kick. Just google before making comments about how silly something is, before your starting to sound silly yourself.</div></div><hr />
