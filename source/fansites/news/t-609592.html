<br />
The realm will open this afternoon / evening, after 17:00 Paris time (CEST).<br />
<br />
Please note that the starting areas may be quite flooded in the beginning, and the population cap is intentionally set a bit lower than normal to not have them even more flooded. The cap will be raised over the coming days as the population spreads out more. <br />

PvP in Wrath of the Lich King<br />
We've also said that we are adding in more outdoor PvP objectives in Wrath of the Lich King as well as a new Battleground, a new Arena, and an entire zone (non-instanced) just built for PvP. I would like to think that those helping test all of these are going to give them thorough run throughs and submit some feedback on how to make these all the best they can be. We want to both encourage PvP and simultaneously allow for people to make choices on how and when they engage in PvP. For PvE realms, the availability and choices of when to PvP or not, is easy to figure out. On PvP realms, the chances of engaging in combat anywhere at anytime are still there. The choice to do so still comes down to players. If you feel that flying mounts cause issues when it comes to PvP, then perhaps you're one of the ones happy about the fact that flying mounts aren't going to be readily available for use in Northrend from the start. (At least that is the plan at this point in time.) (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=7736599448&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=4#71))<br />

Flying mounts in WotLK<br />
Well there's definitely no current plan to make people pay huge amounts to fly again in Northrend; opening the skies of Northrend to flight won't be the next big money sink. As you've mentioned, at the Worldwide Invitational it was stated that we'll be able to fly our current mounts -- and I assume, Druid flight form -- at level 77. Regarding the &quot;defrosting&quot; that was referred to at the developer panel, it was pretty clear from the way it was mentioned that it was a relatively off-the-cuff remark, intended only as an example of one possibility to achieve this.

Worst part is most people feel that flying mounts affect world pvp so much is because not everyone has them, so a lvl 70 char can move around with +360% speed and as a low lvl you just can't ever get away.</div></div><hr />

The time invested would prolly be less &#8364;/$ per hour than working at the mcdonalds, on top of that; its a PVE realm. meaning the group of people interested to buy that char has dropped significantly. But hey man, have fun :)</div></div><hr />

I have no idea why people imagine that PvP servers are more popular. Did you never wonder why all low pop servers are PvP servers, and why the only new servers opened in over a year in either the US or EU are PvE servers? And that all PvE servers are High Pop or Locked?</div></div><hr />

There are more pvp servers than pve (afaik), and on those servers people can transfer a char any place they want to. Like it or not its a fact than u cant transfer the char u bought on a pve realm to a pvp realm where u want to play with your friends/family. Where-as a pvp-server located char u can transfer to both pvp and pve. Im not saying its less popular but u cant deny you would loose a group of potential buyers :)</div></div><hr />

Not to be argumentative, but that is a common misconception. There are 119 PvE or RP servers, compared to 109 PvP or RP-PvP servers. And the PvE ones are much higher population on average.<br />
<br />
So yes, you would lose a group of potential buyers (not to endorse account selling, which I despise), but it would be a relatively small group.</div></div><hr />
