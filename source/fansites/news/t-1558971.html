We’re here with a brand-new Artcraft! I’m your host, Chris Robinson, senior art director on World of Warcraft, and today we’re showing you where we’re at with the female Tauren.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot; id=&quot;femtaurengal&quot;&gt;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/july/thumb/femTauren01.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/july/femTauren01.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/july/thumb/femTauren02.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/july/femTauren02.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/july/thumb/femTauren03.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/july/femTauren03.jpg)&lt;/div&gt; <br />
<br />
The original female Tauren had a lot of issues with too-angular geometry and stretched-out textures. It’s not her fault—it’s just what we had available to us at the time. Our new process has allowed us to add a lot of detail to her hair, fur, horns, and hooves, to build a far more detailed and expressive face, and to add a lot of definition to her musculature (while retaining her shape and silhouette).<br />
<br />
One other change of note: Warcraft character design is commonly known for its stylized long arms, large hands, and big feet, but the female Tauren’s hands were just completely out of control. We brought them down to a more consistent size with the other updated models, and were also able to add a ton more detail and dexterity in the process.<br />
<br />
We hope you enjoy her new look—let us know what you think in the comments!<br />
<br />
<br />
Coming Soon: Spires of Arakk and Nagrand<br />
In a soon-to-arrive build, we will be opening up Spires of Arakk and Nagrand, and will be raising the level cap to 100, leaving the entire level-up experience open for testing.<br />
<br />
We have a close eye on the feedback that is being posted on these forums, and over the next week or two, you should see resolution for many of the major issues that you've been encountering in the currently released zones.<br />
<br />
Please, keep the feedback coming. It is extremely useful in helping us identify issues that don't manifest in our internal environments, and your opinions on our content and systems are very important to us.<br />
<br />
Thank you for all of your input and support.</div></div><hr />

Also the Tauren female is looking fine. <br />
Would be nice if it had more options and the Taurens lack a lot of customization in certain parts.</div></div><hr />

It's so beautiful I cried a little. I've played my tauren female since vanilla, I love their savage looks but gentle movement. I just finished levling one of each healing class to 90 as a Tauren female, that now proved to be the best decision I ever made.<br />

No way, I hope they keep it! If anything it looks more feminine. <br />

If your comp can't handle this, then maybe you should. Games these days are getting much higher fidelity. Gotta keep up.<br />
if you can run say... Titanfall on min settings, you should be fine here.</div></div><hr />

Oh the good and old argument of &quot;can you do better?&quot;. Seriously? I don't like it so what? And what was the point of showing that alpha model? Of course it's better, doesn't mean I have to like it. Everything but the face is fine for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why? Tauren were never a particularly savage or scary race, besides the 'angry' expression of the new male tauren is certainly very fierce. (inb4 someone links old Warcraft 3 concept art, let me just point out I can dig out the same stuff for orcs then point to their 'jolly' expressions, WoW's artstyle=/=Warcraft 3's)<br />
<br />
The main difference now is their faces aren't stuck in the same expression 24/7, when they're angry they're angry, when they're neutral they're neutral.</div></div><hr />

Is that really what you got from my reply? What I was actually saying was that they are already humanized too much, and you are asking for more simply because you don't find her attractive. What makes you think a Cow Woman should be attractive? Why can't a Cow be a Cow? I think this game has already made too many concessions for people like you. Just look at the Female Orc, Female Troll and the Female Worgen. They look like Humans Cosplaying as their races. All because of the complaints of people like you.

Human males were 2 artcraft blog posts ago.<br />
<br />
Only missing night elf male, trolls and blood elves unless I'm mistaken. (Well, considering Draenei and Blood Elf females have same face, shouldn't be too long)<br />
<br />
And only reasons why trolls were delayed it's because Craig do them and he was injured.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i used to have a shaman one but i race-changed to female orc because i found the model too plain, this change is welcome, but i wont roll back as my orc now has an unique lore name :)<br />
<br />
as part of a constructive criticism, theres something.. &quot;je ne quois&quot; on the model's nose, its looks good enough, but not quite to perfect, maybe im just imagining things, but the nose color may have something to do with it? <br />
<br />
thinking ahead, a question for the blues: will there be a nose customization option that would fit in a tab like &quot;extra details&quot;? would be nice! as an example, frekles, scars, nose color (for beast races), moonkin/feral cat/bear form, brows, chin, etc. (EYES.. SPECIALLY EYE COLOR!!!)<br />
<br />
that would be amazing to have.</div></div><hr />

If I was one of the artists that made this art, I would be pretty offended at that (not that there is anything wrong with transgenders, rather that was not the intended look). <br />

I think you are in a small minority of people who think this way, thankfully. And even more thankfully, almost all people are responding with a resounding &quot;Wow, that looks amazing!&quot;<br />

WHAT A SHOCK, a female pretty similar to a male of the same race..... what an outrage.<br />
<br />
/facepalm<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh be quiet, I said I can't quite pinpoint why I feel they look weird. I am not raging about it thank you very much.<br />
<br />
And when I mean similar, while yes I expect them to look like they are from the same race it doesn't mean the face has to be almost the same. Fem dwarves and males look nothing alike as far as facial features go. And old tauren models have a lot of variation between male and female.<br />

While I would like that to be true, I'm pretty sure they said that they wouldn't, but I can't back that up with a source so, one can hope I am remembering wrong, or they will just give us one anyway because we like a new face much more =P</div></div><hr />

I take that back. This is the best update so far. The female tauren was one of the worst models in the game, and possibly the only one that I refused to play. Now I wish I had made one of my tauren characters female. Must resist the sex change service...</div></div><hr />

Great job nonetheless! Old model looked so disgusting now that we see it in comparison. Glad this beauty is such a big improvement as with all the other races.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
They look much better than before, but some people may feel disappointed because of the significantly smaller boobs.<br />
<br />
Opposed from the D cup melons of the original model? Lol i'm going out on a limb here, but i don't think sexual attractiveness is the #1 concern for players who have female tauren character, or most other female character models for that matter.</div></div><hr />

Trolls are slow in coming because of the tusks.<br />
<br />
The current models just have a hole in the geometry and the tusk is plugged into the hole.<br />

The new models have the mouth animations shaping around the tusks, which is trickier to manage.</div></div><hr />

It's a anthropomorthic cow. They're not supposed to look human-esque feminine, they're supposed to look like cows. You shouldn't really be able to tell the gender difference by the face at all. <br />
<br />
OT: I actually quite like it. Texture quality is georgous, especially on the nose area, I really wish they'd still show the wireframes and texture maps though. <br />
The only thing I don't like, which actually really unsettle me, are the eyes. They are WAY too feminine, they creep me the fuck out, especially in the coy expressions.<br />

<br />
It didn't really look feminine at all to me, it looked like an anthro cow, the only thing that made the original feminine was the fact that it had tits and a waistline on it. The only reason the original doesn't have so much gruffness as the new one does is because there's essentially no detail on the original FemCow, it's got terrible geometry and even worse texture quality. It is an anthro cow, it should have gruffness and hardiness to it, which it does, but it's offset by those eyes, they're really feminine, she's even wearing mascara, and the lips and mouth are significantly softer and plump than the original, which in comparison had a more &quot;masculine&quot; mouth. <br />
<br />
If you look at the comparison shot of the face, the new one definitely looks more feminine.<br />
<br />
As to why you shouldn't be able to tell a different species by it's face. Look at most animals, can you tell it's gender by face alone? Of course you can't. If there's any difference, it's usually a mane or horns, otherwise you have to look at its genitals.</div></div><hr />

Well true, I just think that unless you're looking for something fappable, complaining that they look &quot;manly&quot; is besides the point, which is that they're cows and thus wouldn't fit to human standards of &quot;femininity&quot;, physically or socially. Frankly, I think they look more feminine now, they just have more detail than they did before. <br />
<br />
Especially when you consider official art had them looking like this (you'll have to remove the spaces)<br />

these are the basic static facial expressions. they'll be making proper static/ambient faces to alleviate the &quot;sameface&quot; people have been crying over, at which point you'll likely see a more angry/hostile looking face you can use. Trust me, by live, these will look much cooler than they already do.</div></div><hr />

Samwise's art comes to mind. I think it's just flavors. Some people want more feminine, some people want more androgynous.<br />
<br />
It was actually really difficult to find official art of Tauren female...aw so unloved :(<br />
<br />
I found this one by samwise, but I can't actually tell if that's male or female, I'm ever so slightly leaning towards it being female, but it could also be a benevolent younger male.(You'll have to remove the spaces again &gt;&lt;)<br />
<br />

<br />
At the end of the day, I'm not too fussed if they're more feminine or more androgonous, (though they shouldn't be so feminine as to appear dainty or cute)as having gender disparity makes things more visually interesting. I really just wanted to point out, that if you think about it, creases, hard skin, squareness of jaw and general cow-esque features that are present in the faces of real cows would be consistant across the genders. And really all they've done is add that detail that was missing from the original model, so that the in game model is closer to the art, which is actually more animal like, not more masculine. The original was so lacking in detail you had to fill in what they looked like with your own perception and imagination. It's not that they now look more masculine, it's that Tauren Males already had more detail on them that FemCows lacked.<br />
<br />
I personally really like the model with the exception of the eyes, they look like they belong on Jessica Rabbit and thus creep me out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ever seen a female tauren in real life? No? That's because she's a female minotaur (ie: a fictional beast in fantasy), not a fucking cow. Don't make that comparison. You are really doing nothing but asking for trouble. She's an anthropomorphized she-cow who's deliberately given female characteristics to distinguish her from males. She has intentionally been made &quot;pretty&quot;. She has been given human-like breasts. She's been made more human than cow, so it is not sensational to expect her to not have a rugged, masculine jaw. And if we're really in the business of comparing tauren to cows than I guess the two sexes should look almost exactly the same, while males have large horns and females have utters. Cause they're cows. lol</div></div><hr />

Well...I certainly can't disagree with you there. I only saw the stuff roughly around where I posted, which only had that one thing on peoples avatars, the rest of the posts I saw of his were discussing the actual content. Looking back through the thread, yeah he has done that, although what he's doing isn't white knighting. He's just badly wording the way he disagrees with people, which is not to say I'm defending him for acting like that, just calling someone a white knight just because you disagree with them is pretty sloppy.<br />

<br />
Indelicately put, but I believe the issue is the forehead. We tend to see strong brow ridges as masculine, although there are many objectively feminine women with them. The region between the eyebrows to the horns needs to be a little sunken or horns heightened in order to give a feminine appearance. <br />
<br />
The issue about the nose is the opposite. The nose is a little too human and looks odd. It should be flattened and integrated into the snout.</div></div><hr />

I have looked at both of them and I find the old one more feminine.<br />

As to why you shouldn't be able to tell a different species by it's face. Look at most animals, can you tell it's gender by face alone? Of course you can't. If there's any difference, it's usually a mane or horns, otherwise you have to look at its genitals.<br />
<br />
Yeah even though they're based on animals, I think they can make it clear whether they are male or female. Worgen male looks very male, Worgen female looks very female. They are as much based on wolves as Tauren are based on cows/bulls.</div></div><hr />

Pretty scary when it becomes &quot;the norm&quot; to be a pissy little complainer about everything that is ever created, and being positive and happy is considered bad. Thankfully, Blizzard learned their lesson with the worgen female...don't listen to the Negative Nates! They ARE listening to constructive criticism though, such as with the sameface issue.</div></div><hr />

the cartony style is what make WoW unique, look at all the others mmorpg: swtor, ff14, eso , etc.. all their character are too pc like, no life seem to be in them, each race are the same, it's why i love WoW so much, it's make the game more enjoyable from the eyes sides<br />

Tauren appealed to me the most; it was what I wanted to make first. I also liked the druid class. When I got into the game and saw the model for the Tauren female, I changed my mind. It was just very off-putting. I ended up going alliance and making a night elf druid instead. Later on I made a Horde druid but elected to go Troll. I am now sad that I did that. I like trolls, but this transformation is absolutely amazing! While I am certain that the new troll models will be really well done; the female Tauren appealed to me first, before seeing the model and this new model is beyond my expectations. I can appreciate the criticisms but I can't agree with them. This particular model is the most improved. Very impressive! :D</div></div><hr />

So happy they have teeth now! And that the hands have been scaled down a bit. I mostly play taurens - and females ones at that! My main is a female tauren warrior that's been around since the very early days of BC. I'm looking forward to her make over. <br />
<br />
I do have a few comments/concerns though. One is color of the nose. It's a bit a dark and it's a bit jarring. I think that has contributed to some of the comments I've seen about the nose, - especially the ones I've seen around calling it a &quot;dog nose&quot;. I'm assuming/hope that there will be face options that will allow for lighter colored snouts that compliment the fur color. <br />
<br />
I think over all that the model is great. I like that she's still a &quot;big girl&quot; and that it looks like she and male both belong to the same species. I'm looking forward to seeing the animations and faces. And on the subject of faces, since you all are doing such a good job on the models, it would be a same not to give them some face options, maybe more hair style options, a bit of ornamentation, and maybe some color options for the mane. I know I'm getting greedy now, but a girl can dream.</div></div><hr />

My ONLY criticism is the nose on both genders. It does look more canine than bovine. The dark coloration needs to go down to the lip. But seriously, that's the only thing I would change. I love this model! She wasn't made more childlike in the name of being ultra feminine, she looks like a Minotaur woman should and I adore that. She and the male look like the same species, and all in all it's just beautifully done. Good job Blizz!</div></div><hr />

* I got rid of the mouth-breathing action and closed her mouth.<br />
* Lengthened nose<br />
* Adjusted the nose so it is more 'cow' like and blends into the rest of the muzzle/mouth area.<br />
* Added hair style similiar to what is found in game. (The hair is cheaply/fastly done)<br />
* Adjusted the eyes... The eyes looked odd to me.<br />
* There are complaints of new models not resembling the old one like Blizzard promised. I also adjusted eye color to match the original model (I will be very sad if we lose that plum purple color :( )<br />

I definitely can see what you're talking about. It wasn't my initial goal to 'prettify'. I actually like the models (minus low polygon counts) they have currently in game.<br />
The biggest issue I have currently is the nose. It is strange to me how it's sitting there and has a cat-like lip indention.</div></div><hr />

I think it definitely looks more female but I find the nose to be a bit too long now. I think changing the hairstyle did wonders and the eyes look much better. Closing the mouth was probably the thing that made the most difference.</div></div><hr />

On a more serious note, I suppose it looks good. Kind of. It's an improvement, yes, but it doesn't look the same at all. Also why do they change eye colors all the time? She is supposed to have purple eyes, not blue one for fucks sake.</div></div><hr />

What I changed:<br />
* I got rid of the mouth-breathing action and closed her mouth.<br />
* Lengthened nose<br />
* Adjusted the nose so it is more 'cow' like and blends into the rest of the muzzle/mouth area.<br />
* Added hair style similiar to what is found in game. (The hair is cheaply/fastly done)<br />
* Adjusted the eyes... The eyes looked odd to me.<br />
* There are complaints of new models not resembling the old one like Blizzard promised. I also adjusted eye color to match the original model (I will be very sad if we lose that plum purple color :( )<br />
<br />
This is so much better. I see I'm not the only one pointing out the exact same issues on the model.<br />

while your changes &quot;seem&quot; nice. it wont work out. You've treated this like a 2d artwork at this angle.<br />
<br />
It just won't work for a 3d model with proper perspectives in place. Those edits you made only look good at this angle and changing the angle will make it look freaky as hell and distorted at any other angle.<br />
<br />

also what the hell is up with the &quot;as if michael bay designed it&quot; phrase? No it doesnt. what a ridiculous statement. Michael bay is not a catch-all term for something you don't like. Don't dilute pop-culture references, it is one of the worst act perpetrated by the media and consumers.</div></div><hr />

The tauren female's character always came across as softly-spoken, peaceful and more feminine in nature than perhaps some of the other races. And no I don't say this because I feel tauren female should be sexy or are sexy, I'm a female player who had one as my main for a number of years.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah even though they're based on animals, I think they can make it clear whether they are male or female. Worgen male looks very male, Worgen female looks very female. They are as much based on wolves as Tauren are based on cows/bulls.<br />
<br />
I personally can't see it, Old FemCow looks more feminine than Old ManCow model sure, but were you to be presented with just that facial model, are you telling me you could identify it as a female? To me, it looks like a cow breed with horns, and the only way I could tell that from a bull was /perhaps/ the horns, but really only by it's udders, or this case, tits. It doesn't have any &quot;female&quot; characteristics in the face to define it as such as far as I'm concerned. You'll have to spell it out for me. <br />
<br />
True, Worgen are quite differentiated, but that's because 1: They're werewolves, not anthros. Yeah they are humanized wolves, but they're also really humans that have transformed into wolves, not just anthropomorphic wolves. 2: They have waaaaay more detail in them. Worgen are a Cataclysm race, wheras FemCows have the worst model in terms of sheer graphical fidelity and detail. 3: A lot of people hate this: She's got human-esque eyes stuck on her, she's got eyelashes and I think mascara on, they don't look like they're supposed to be there at all. They look as if they have the eyes from a completely different race compared to male worgen, that is not good race design. No other race has this issue. Hence the continued notion to some people that they should change the female worgen model to be more in line with it's male counterpart. Take a look at this for the comparison. <br />
<br />
http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/099/5/3/female_worgen_stuff_by_hitsujifox-d3dl2jo.png<br />
<br />
The difference between male and female worgen is astoundingly off. The same with the nose and mouth area, you can mansculinize and feminize the genders, but the level of disparity shouldn't be so apparent. Human men and Women have facial differences to be sure, but they're not so radically different that we look like different races. Male and Female worgen look like two quite different breeds of dog. <br />
<br />
At the end of the day, I just don't think any of the female animal races need to look &quot;pretty&quot;, as in attractive. Because even though they're anthromorphs, they are still supposed to be animal races, and as such, the men and women should look like they belong to the same race, not have the females be &quot;pretty&quot; for...what purpose exactly? You shouldn't find them pretty, because they're cows, they don't and shouldn't fit into what humans find pretty, because they're not human. If people happen to find them pretty that's fine, but Blizzard shouldn't be attempting to make them &quot;attractive&quot;. That's what rule 34 is for. The thing is, I even like furry porn from time to time, but that doesn't mean I want my in game models turned into fappable wank bait. Or have eyeshadow with pumped up eyelashes and smouldering eyes. It's the same as I like Women and enjoy porn in real life, but I still think Plate bikinis are stupid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know if I could identify the Tauren female as a female just by looking at it. Probably not, but it's hard to tell, as I know it belongs in the context of a game where there are races, some based on animals, that often have males and females. If you give me all of the faces of all the races and tell me to sort them after which belonged together and which are male and female, I think I could get the job done.<br />
<br />
It's hard for me to point out what female characteristics the old face has, but I just think the original Tauren looks softer, gentler, than the male Tauren, in the same way that the female Worgen looks softer than the male. The new female Tauren to me might as well be the male Tauren.<br />
<br />
Aren't werewolves basically anthropomorphic wolves? I mean what would be the difference? If they weren't humans that transformed into wolves, but a race that is created as humanoid wolves, how would they look different? <br />
<br />
The Cataclysm models have way more detail in them than the Vanilla models, sure, but I'm comparing the female Worgen to the new female Tauren, and I'm saying that the female Worgen is a good example of how you can create a race based on animals and make the male look like a male and the female look like a female. I don't think anyone would confuse the two.<br />
<br />
I personally like the old female Tauren, never had a problem with it. I've never heard anyone complain to be honest. As far as the alpha female Worgen, I liked that one a lot, probably more than the live version, but it still looked female. I totally agree that the live female Worgen looks a lot like a Chihuahua, but that's a different problem I think.<br />
<br />
I'm not so sure if animal races shouldn't also be somewhat pretty. In the end they are still humanoid. I mean take the female alpha troll. Sure it's not an animal race, but it's one of the more brutish races. The female looked hideous. Everything about it looked hideous. And even the live female troll model has one pretty face, that most people use I think. I know at least I do, because the rest is just terrible.<br />
<br />
And it's really great that you can enjoy furry porn, but the thing with the female tauren character model to me is, that they look like thin male tauren. If the job is to make them look like cows, then I think not even that is achieved.</div></div><hr />

The biggest part I dislike it the nose. It's just not cow like and it isn't even the same as the old one! <br />
Cow noses go all the way down to the upper lip and cows do NOT have a splitted upper lip! At least that should be corrected. <br />
I also don't like the large lower lip and the old face was much slimmer. And the ears! A bit more detail like hair insede would be great and pointing up - right now they look like old leather rags.<br />
And the hole in the middle of their hump hair is kinda strange - so is their forehead hair.<br />

I tried painting over the face to show what I would like my tauren to look :)<br />

I put the horns a bit small and up and the forehead hair didn't really work out for me but it really dosn't look good in the new model.<br />
I made a more cow like nose, smaller lips, chin and nose, worked a bit on the cheeks. Also I made the eyes smaller and the eyebrows as well. And I made the whole mouth smaller, the lips look more canine like than bovine like. (lower pictures)<br />
The last thing I changed were the ears. Pointing upwards and more detail.<br />

I know everyone has a different taste but the part with the nose is just simple wrong. I hope they correct at least the splitted upper lip. Every thing else is not so important for me x)</div></div><hr />

I've always felt the tauren should have eyebrows, so I added some.<br />
I elongated the eyelashes a bit.<br />
I elongated the snout.<br />
I changed the nose shape to better match a cows and the original tauren.<br />
I changed the nose color to include hints of pink, and brought the coloring down to the lips.<br />

<br />
From what I understand, they do not have eyebrows currently. <br />
The line you see under the fringe is the shadow of where the brow ridge ends. Instead of giving them defined eyebrows, they gave them a meaty moveable ridge above the eyes (like they did with the male taurens)<br />
<br />
It is better seen (the meaty ridge brow) in the secondary female tauren images:<br />

The original face just looked off to me, and too similar somehow to the new male tauren. I couldn't put my finger on what was wrong, but your version looks much better. The biggest things that helped I think were the eyebrows, thicker eyelashes, and nose change. One thing that might make the nose look even better is to smooth out that ridge between her nose and upper lip. I really hope Blizzard takes our constructive criticism to heart on this. Female tauren are my favorite horde characters to play and I do like the upgrades that Blizz made to the model overall (the old one was a bit of a mess, but still had its charm).</div></div><hr />
