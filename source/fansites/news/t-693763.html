Icecrown Citadel: Raid Weekly Quests<br />
The Icecrown Citadel weekly quests are now official. <br />
Now that Icecrown Citadel has been fully unlocked, allowing players the ability to progress in 10- and 25-player formats to defeat the Lich King, new raid weekly quests have been unlocked! These quests are specific to the Icecrown Citadel raid dungeon and do not correspond with the standard random raid weekly quest offered in Dalaran. Here's an overview of what you need to know.<br />
<br />
One of five quests will be randomly available each week in both 10- and 25-player versions of the dungeon. This means each player has the opportunity to complete two Icecrown Citadel raid weekly quests each week if the dungeon is run in both versions, however, these quests have to be completed within the raid version (10- or 25-player) in which they are offered.<br />
<br />
If a player obtains one of these quests but does not complete it that week, the quest will automatically be removed from the player's Quest Log the next time Lord Marrowgar is defeated under a new raid ID, or when zoning into an instance with a new raid ID where Lord Marrowgar has already been defeated. This only applies if the random raid weekly offered when the player enters a fresh Icecrown Citadel raid instance happens to be different from the one already in his or her Quest Log. Players can otherwise simultaneously have both the 10- and 25-player raid weekly quests in their Quest Logs and complete either of them at any time during the week in their respective raid versions. The quests given each week in 10- and 25-player versions of Icecrown Citadel will be randomly determined once Lord Morrowgar is killed, or once a player zones into an instance where Lord Morrowgar has already been killed.<br />
<br />
The Quests:<br />
<br />
Deprogramming (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24875/deprogramming/) - Look for a rogue named Infiltrator Minchar outside of Lady Deathwhisper's chamber. He'll speak of a brainwashed operative who needs saving from the lady's powerful means of influence. While engaging Deathwhisper, keep an eye out for a warrior named Darnavan among her minions. He must live if your raid group is to succeed in completing the quest.<br />
<br />
Securing the Ramparts (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24877/securing-the-ramparts/) - After taking the platform up to the ramparts from Lady Deathwhisper's chamber, a lieutenant of your faction will seek your help in slaying the Rotting Frost Giant on the other end of the ramparts terrorizing his troops. Bring the monster down and return to the lieutenant for your reward.<br />
<br />
Residue Rendezvous (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24878/residue-rendezvous/) - Should you succeed in killing Deathbringer Saurfang, you will soon meet Alchemist Adrianna upon lurking further into the citadel. She will task your group with the unfortunate job of being infected by both a Green Residue from Rotface and an Orange Residue from Festergut. While infected with both residues, at least one player from the raid must speak with Alchemist Adrianna in order for everyone in the group to receive credit.<br />
<br />
Blood Quickening (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24879/blood-quickening/) - Outside the Crimson Hall awaits Alrin the Agile to inform your group that his friend, Infiltrator Minchar, has been captured by the San'layn for interrogation. Should you choose to help in rescuing Minchar, you will have 30 minutes from the moment you step foot in the Crimson Hall to kill Blood-Queen Lana'thel before she executes him. Fortunate enough for you, she will not kill Minchar if she is busy fighting your group.<br />
<br />
Respite for a Tormented Soul (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24880/respite-for-a-tormented-soul/) - If your group can successfully free Valithria, she will morph into her humanoid form to offer you a quest in a more approachable manner. Providing each player who accepts the quest with a Pulsating Life Crystal, a channeling device, Valithria will speak of a way to save Sindragosa's spirit. Members of the raid who use these crystals on Sindragosa when she is below 20% health will slowly stack on her the Life Infusion debuff. Reaching 30 stacks (10-player) or 75 stacks (25-player) of Life Infusion before she dies will provide the frost wyrm with an aura of Soul Preservation. If your group manages to give Sindragosa this aura before killing her, a quest item can be obtained from her remains to complete Valithria's task.<br />
<br />
The Reward:<br />
Completing any of these quests will reward each member of the group with a Sack of Frosty Treasures (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52006/sack-of-frosty-treasures/) and a healthy chunk of gold. The sack will contain Emblems of Frost (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49426/emblem-of-frost/) and other potentially valuable items!

Dungeon Finder Loot System (Auto Disenchant, Auto Roll, etc ...)<br />
We're talking about many ways to improve the Dungeon Finder system, including the way looting is done. The system is quite new and popular, so we want to continue iterating upon it. As you might have expected when seeing the &quot;Blizz&quot; logo on this thread on a Friday night though, I don't have any specific details to share just yet. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/23041994170-will-blizzard-ever-redo-loot-system.html))<br />

Auction House iPhone Application<br />
We'll let everyone know if and when we get to the point of adding this application to more devices. We're currently focused on getting the functionality working properly for this device at this time. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/23042534104-auction-house-iphone-app.html))<br />
<br />
Nibelung Hotfix<br />
I updated my last post, the val'kyr heals for 25% of her maximum health and that is intended.<br />
<br />
Regarding the proc chance, the recent change made it so other items/procs can no longer cause other items to procs, only spells a player knows. This is why we increased the proc chance for this item from from 1% to 2% but that is still a buff overall.

Sacred Duty Nerf<br />
I don't think the situation is nearly as grim as you're painting it to be. Paladins are still very desirable tanks from a hardcore raiding or casual perspective. The class is still able to attain great mitigation through block talents and maintains multiple lines of defense against mass damage spikes. While, yes, this is a reduction, it is not big enough to break the tanking mechanics that the class plays by. It will have mild adverse effects, but it simply brings the class back into the range of play of other tanking classes. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/5/23042534264-prot-nerf.html))<br />

Trauma Bug<br />
<br />
Today, actually. We found a bug where Trauma's pulse would only heal players in that party. For example, a priest in group 1 has Trauma and it procs on the rogue in group 2. Everyone in group 2 can get healed by the pulse, but not anyone in other groups. This obviously limits the amount of healing that the proc can accomplish overall.<br />
<br />
We will keep an eye on the weapon after this change and make sure it is accomplishing what we think it should. Please keep in mind that sometimes when we do not immediately buff something it could be because we suspect something else might be going on. We try to keep you generally clued in to our philosophy and intent, but it's just not possible for every issue that pops up in the forums, nor even those with a lot of traffic or the ones you feel very passionate about. If you bring up issues though, we do promise to read them. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/22748824225-so-when-will-trauma-be-buffed-too-.html))<br />

There's a chance of an epic gem or even an epic BoE item ;) Getting one of those would surely make up for it :D<br />
<br />
EDIT: I agree with some of the posters in the thread on the wow forums though, the difference in difficulty is a bit out of whack. We had the Deathwhisper one this week, which simply amounted to me grabbing the named add, dragging him to the back and then having one of our druid keeping him rooted throughout the encounter. I'm not so sure it would have been as easy if we had been given the BQL or Sindragosa ones :-X</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because iPhone OS has a lot more users than Android and since it's apparently going to be a premium service, it makes sense to sell it on an App Store that people actually use. (Assuming that the premium will be a one time purchase, and not some Battle.net subscription or something) Edit: In numbers, they're around 18% for iPhone OS and 3% for Android.<br />
<br />

<br />
That's not the problem at all, it's that some of the weekly ICC quests are drastically harder than others yet give the same reward. Lets compare 2 easy extremes:<br />
Deprogramming: during the first wave of adds one named Darnavan will apear. Keep Darnavan alive while defeating Lady Deathwhisper (the 2nd boss in the instance, designed to eventually killed without much trouble by everybody).<br />
Respite of a Tormented Soul: Defeat Sindragosa (an end-of-wing boss, one of the 4 hardest in the instance) after having raid members channel a beam on her during arguably the hardest phase of the fight until it reaches 30+stacks.<br />
<br />
2nd boss Vs end-of-wing boss. Both quests give 5 emblems of frost. Balanced? Not even close. 20 would be too far but maybe 10 if it involves an end-of-wing boss?</div></div><hr />

Don't get me wrong, the iPhone has a larger market share than the Android, so it's no surprise Blizzard would develop the app for the iPhone first, but charts like that are misleading. At first glance most people would assume that tries to represent handset market share, which it doesn't.<br />
<br />
From Admob's site &quot;It provides a measure of mobile data usage and does not represent the number of handsets in the market.&quot; Of course, this should be overly apparent since for North America it lists 65.1% for the iPhone. If that measured handsets, it would mean nearly 2 out of every 3 smart phones is an iPhone in North America.</div></div><hr />

At first glance most people would assume that tries to represent handset market share, which it doesn't.<br />
<br />
From Admob's site &quot;It provides a measure of mobile data usage and does not represent the number of handsets in the market.&quot; Of course, this should be overly apparent since for North America it lists 65.1% for the iPhone. If that measured handsets, it would mean nearly 2 out of every 3 smart phones is an iPhone in North America.<br />

Well, the title in the chart says what it represents :P &quot;Operating system share of mobile web&quot;, it is not the market shares no, but it shows &quot;the data on browsing on Internet sites from mobile device&quot;. I think you are reading the wrong chart explanation, as I didn't give the direct link to it. Here is the direct link http://metrics.admob.com/2010/01/mobile-browsing-trends-from-quantcast/ , this just shows that either the android users are not using their devices to browse web, or they are minority of all mobile internet users.</div></div><hr />

Are you a QQer? OMG THEY PUT IT IN THE GAME, I MUST QQ ABOUT IT WITH AS MANY RANTS AS I CAN. Blizzard is the worse, all of their ideas are stolen and bugged the first time they implement them! On the flipside, i will continue to pay and play their games so i can continue to complain!</div></div><hr />
