Super quick news post about the server issues.  
We're aware that many players are currently receiving the message &quot;Login Server Busy, Please Try Again&quot; whenever attempting to log into World of Warcraft. While we don't have an ETA for when this issue will be resolved, we're looking into it at this time and hope have everyone back in the game as soon as possible. 
 
In the meantime, in order to keep reports consolidated, we ask that you please keep posts" />

It has to do with people who were billed on the 18th, for some reason the system has gotten hosed up and now everyone who got billed then has fallen out of their subscription period and shows &quot;pending&quot; on their account.</div></div><hr />

It went out for me sometime between 3pm and 6pm CST. <br />
<br />
Edit: Still doesn't work for me btw.<br />
<br />
This is a stretch, but surely Blizz doesn't use Amazon for hosting stuff like this and it's just a coincidence that they're having trouble too?<br />
