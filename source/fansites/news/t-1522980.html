Asking again b/c you said it's okay: Is the goal of Resolve to keep defensive &amp; healing abilities exactly as strong as now?<br />
I wouldn't say the same as 'now' (meaning live). Tank AM *gameplay* is awesome, but its *effectiveness* is too strong on live. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466841403721388032))<br />
And yes, those things are quite connected. We just want to skew toward tanks needing more external healing than they do today. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466841685746413568))<br />

Shame about no Dread Raven, because those are the coolest birds I've seen in WoW. At least we know Chimeras maybe? How come maybe?<br />
Lots of new stuff in Draenor (ravager, bat, boar, etc.), some things might warrant a cool quest/drop (like dinomancy/rhok'delar) (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/466744423058276352))<br />
<br />
Since you're talking about hunter pets a bit, PLEASE tell me we can tame talbuks! You'll make my day! Week even!<br />
Not at the moment, open to the idea but it's a snowball of ungulates. Ungulate is an awful name for a family too. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/466743883121315840))<br />
<br />
Will MM Hunters be losing Master Marksman? If not, how will it interact with Focusing Shot?<br />
No, Master Marksman stays, and does interact with Focusing Shot. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/467058083496071168))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/imonks.gif Monk (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/341-Monk) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/monk) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#o))<br />
Second: Why not allow Surging Mist to generate 1 Chi for Windwalker? Serious question. I understand why not for Brewmaster.<br />
It's definitely less clear for WW than BM, as you say. It's something we're considering, but not sure. Generating 1 may be OK, ... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466842100487581697))<br />
...because that's still a significant loss compared to the 2 chi from Jab. We're still evaluating that. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466842308038520833))<br />
<br />
Finally: Will Fists of Fury's AP snapshotting stay? It doesn't snapshot TeB, which makes it weird, so that's why I'm asking.<br />
Don't think so; I think it's going to be totally dynamic. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466842475529654274))<br />
<br />
Why do Healing Spheres still exist as an object? Mobility is being tuned down in WoD making picking them up even more punitive.<br />
You still get the healing even if they're not picked up, making them not punitive. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466877630499667968))<br />

Holy Shield Update? When i saw it in vanilla, as a d2 fan i was so happy! Can't wait for its glorious (and useful) return!<br />
We actually were running the numbers and found that at 10%, it's not really that far off of our targets. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466812061729558528))<br />
So then is gladiator stance over tuned? 10% block=3% phys damage reduction. How does that compare vs 5% total damage reduction?<br />
10% block is &gt;3% damage reduction. (Not that we necessarily balance Pally talents vs Warrior talents, but these should be similar.) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466816910672134144))<br />
<br />
Character / Items<br />
will 4/4 upgraded legendary cloaks proc more often?<br />
Nope. Lots of stats though. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/466772941892775936))<br />
<br />
why was the choice made to display tooltips for CDR trinks as 'cooldown recovery rate'? very unintuitive for the players.<br />
We actually show both forms of it in 6.0, for that reason. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466811918066274305))<br />
<br />
why not have multi gear equip slots for multi specs(resto/dps/tank) that is going to save a lot of bag space?<br />
We're making changes to make most gear sharable between specs, including cross-primarystat. Check out the patch notes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466814771212201984))<br />
I'm not sure if this was shared anywhere, but is it intended that tier gear still remains unique and spec specific?<br />
No, tier gear is shared across specs too. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466838985503801344))<br />
<br />
Since valor is being removed. How is the system going to adjust so very unlucky people get gear? coins don't help very unlucky<br />
Just because there's no &quot;valor&quot; doesn't mean there won't be alternate sources of gear, including vendors. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/466989347066372096))<br />
<br />
Achievements<br />
So much for Bigger Bag not being able to be account wide eh?No seriously. THANK YOU.<br />
There were technical hurdles, but they were worth clearing to solve a major point of frustration for players. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/466779902034071554))<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor Stats<br />
Will the MS stat work on bleeds the same way it works on dot ticks/ignite ticks, double the tick but not the whole dot debuff?<br />
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/467035074802614272))<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 5.4.8 Hotfixes - May 21<br />
Battlegrounds and Arenas<br />
<br />
Resolved an issue where the Rated Battleground flag carrier debuff functioned incorrectly. Characters in a Tanking specialization should now correctly take 50% additional damage while carrying a flag in a Rated Battleground.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Replica General's Leather Treads (http://www.wowdb.com/items/77904-replica-generals-leather-treads) no longer increases the duration of Sprint in Arenas or Rated Battlegrounds.<br />
Burden of Eternity (http://www.wowdb.com/items/103982-burden-of-eternity) may no longer be used while inside a Heroic Dungeon, Raid, or Scenario.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bug Fixes<br />
<br />
Resolved an issue where Feats of Strength for Collector's Edition: Dread Raven and Collector’s Edition: Dread Hatchling were not being correctly awarded to players.<br />
Resolved an issue where players transitioning from Eastern Plaguelands into Ghostlands while on certain flying mounts would be unable to resummon the mount until the they relog back in.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Rated Battleground Flag Carrier Hotfixes<br />
We’ve recently identified an issue that was causing the Rated Battleground flag carrier debuff to function incorrectly. Under normal circumstances, non-tank flag carriers in Warsong Gulch and Twin Peaks should take 20% additional damage, and tank-specced flag carriers should take 50% additional damage. Currently, that debuff is only increasing damage to tank-specced players by 20%. We’re in the process of applying a hotfix that will, once again, cause tank-specced players to take 50% increased damage when carrying the flag. This hotfix will be applied as soon as possible, and will not require realm restarts to activate.<br />
<br />
In addition, we’re working on expanding that functionality to orb carriers in Rated Temple of Kotmogu, and cart carriers in Rated Deepwind Gorge. In Temple of Kotmogu, we’ll be increasing the extra damage taken while carrying the orb to 50% if the player has chosen a tank specialization. In Deepwind Gorge, we’ll be applying the same debuff used in Warsong Gulch and Twin Peaks. Cart carriers who have chosen a DPS or healing specialization will take 20% increased damage, while cart carriers who have chosen a tank specialization will take 50% increased damage. These changes will not be applied until next week’s realm maintenance.<br />
<br />
These mechanics and changes are exclusive to Rated Battlegrounds. They will not be applied to non-Rated BGs.<br />
<br />
One addition: why not EOTS? We can still hold flags there with no debuff.<br />
We don't think the same debuff is the best solution for Eye of the Storm, but we are considering some other potential options. We agree that turtling with the flag doesn't result in the best gameplay.<br />

<br />
I suppose they could still add armor sets but it wouldn't surprise me if they didn't. Since they are retiring the MoP sets, any new CM sets would have to be the most impressive armor ever implemented to overcome the &quot;no longer available&quot; factor.</div></div><hr />

WTF are you talking about? Those are some of the most advanced effects we ever had on WoW weapons. What do you want? <br />
Some Final Fantasy summon shit going down when you use them?<br />

I'd honestly like to know your definition of a spectacular weapon. To me, these are some of the best I've seen, if not THE best (especially the sword and axe).<br />

Since you ask.<br />
<br />
Would be nice with a few weapons that actually looked like weapons, these look more like wall decorations that would break at the first sign of combat. (beef them up a little)<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong though, some of these weapons looks good.</div></div><hr />

wait what? the entire clothing section down the middle is leather and the arms and helm are granite rock. it's based on the Fomor gron-like creatures. I know i wouldn't want to be punched by those arms.<br />

<br />
its the sign of a poor ego when someone needs to spit on peoples excitement as childishness to boost how good they feel about themselves. <br />
<br />
People like the new models and are expressing it. Get over yourself. its a welcome change from the constant QQ and whine fests. Do we really have to spit on and discourage positive responses? Is encouraging negativity and discouraging positive notions really that healthy? Being a spoilsport?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaiarra</div><div class="date">2014-05-23, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bit disappointed with the weapons... my first thought was 'ooooh c mode weapons to match the c mode armor, cool', but that lot looks like it came out of ICC/Firelands and certainly won't remotely match the MoP C mode Druid armor (don't know about the other classes). Plus some classes get access to way more weapon choices than others. Would have preferred at least class themed weapons (but that would take them more time).<br />
<br />
Meh, preferred the idea of a single armor set as a reward; not sure these are worth doing C modes for (I guess that's a good thing as me and the people I'd do them with, hate C modes). Guess we will see if they're gold or silver reward (I hope they're not silver as I'd rather have a mount).<br />
<br />
Edit: Also what the poster below said, hate guns, want bow. No amazing bow model means I can skip C modes on my alt though, so I guess win win.</div></div><hr />

IMO that talbuk dagger/mace thing is probably the only remotely inspired, interesting model out of the whole lot. Almost everything else screams ICC/Firelands to me (shields look like Ulduar models, and green sword looks like Talon of Azshara).</div></div><hr />

Yes i know the pic name says 1h mace,but it being pointy and sharp at the front will probably make it a first mace ever which looks daggerish.<br />
I don't like it anyway so i guess i am fine with it if it is a mace.<br />

Meanwhile the Paladin set is labeled as Mythic.....I'm starting to wonder if Mythic will have its own graphics for gear.<br />
<br />
The normal mode Paladin t17 set was datamined back in April. It's significantly different, no weird light show on the shoulders, it looks very similar to t4 from Kara. After all you don't want those normal mode heroes getting mistaken for 'real' raiders do you?</div></div><hr />

Maybe it is because so many people might say something like &quot;after i cruise through lfr, why would I do normal or heroic? It's just the same thing again!&quot; BUT if you put some shiny twerderkly blue effect on the shoulders, suddenly those same people are like OMG WANT. Next day in guild chat they're like &quot;any room on the raid team?&quot;<br />

I don't know... it all makes sense to me.</div></div><hr />

The animations on these weapons are arguably all the best animations ever on weapons or shields. All of them. If you don't like those weapons, you reallllllly are looking in the wrong forums. There are lots of video games out there.</div></div><hr />

I did some of the effects were cool (the flame on one of the weapons looked very nice) but minus the effects they are stupid looking imho.</div></div><hr />

That is the best part of all these? The gun firing animation, the 1h sword... it grows bigger and this like axe forms at the end... I mean, these are the type of weapon effects reserved for bosses and lore figures normally. I'm sure I cannot change your opinion, so instead I /facepalm.</div></div><hr />

I like the spell effects for all of these weapons. Pretty cool stuff. I love how they come apart of &quot;upgrades&quot; into an alternate attack mode like the 1h sword and the rifle for example. Sounds like something out of an anime on paper, looks badass in-game!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Eh? Why's that then?<br />
I think it was because using the Burden of Eternity in those circumstances was triggering the &quot;trade timer&quot; flag, making it possible to trade item level 535 gear that were normally BoP. I could be wrong, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would be nice with a few weapons that actually looked like weapons, these look more like wall decorations that would break at the first sign of combat. (beef them up a little)<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong though, some of these weapons looks good.<br />
<br />
Fair enough. Well, almost all weapons before raiding level (below Lv58) look like actual weapons, none of the floating, glowing shit. But I don't see any praise coming from them, nor do I see alot of transmogs.</div></div><hr />

Before:<br />

After:<br />
<br />

<br />
Personally, I liked the Before. It gave more of a crazy alchemist/poison master vibe that has disappeared with the cool, but kinda bland batman mask thing in the After.</div></div><hr />
