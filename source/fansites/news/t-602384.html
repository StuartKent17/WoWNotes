Patch 2.2.2 going live on Tuesday/Wednesday<br />
Daghorn, a french community representative confirmed in this post (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=1016342728&amp;sid=2) that the Brewfest will start on October 3rd. This event cannot start without the 2.2.2 patch and it means that we'll be getting it Tuesday in the US and Wednesday in Europe.<br />
<br />
New PvP items in 2.3<br />
New cloaks, even if the healing wand (see below) is confirmed for the Season 3, these one are just confirmed for 2.3 and they could be released sooner. (but it's unlikely in my opinion, see the explanation below)<br />
<br />
<br />
[Melee DPS Cloak]<br />
+34 Stamina<br />
+20 Critical Strike rating<br />
+20 Resilience rating<br />
+46 Attack Power<br />
+112 Armor Penetration<br />
<br />
[Caster DPS Cloak]<br />
+34 Stamina<br />
+15 Intellect<br />
+16 Spell Critical rating<br />
+23 Resilience<br />
+27 Spell Damage/Heal<br />
<br />
There's a PvP healing cloak in patch 2.3. The vital stats are...<br />
[Healer PvP Cloak]<br />
+34 Stamina<br />
+15 Intellect<br />
+6 Mana/5 Sec (was +16 Spell Critical Strike rating but got changed after a post (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=1762876473&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=4#77)<br />
+23 Resilience rating<br />
+51 Healing / +17 Spell Damage (Because of the 33% spell damage bonus)<br />
<br />
There is also a hunter weapon revealed in the same post.<br />
<br />
[Vengeful Gladiator's Waraxe]<br />
+62 Stamina<br />
+46 Critical Strike rating<br />
+33 Resilience rating<br />
+15 Hit rating<br />
+92 Attack Power<br />
+98 Armor Penetration<br />
<br />
Cost: 1000 arena points (no rating requirement)<br />
<br />
The following is pure speculation, but this weapon isn't labeled as &quot;Merciless Gladiator&quot;, Vengeful could be the new Season 3 prefix and it would also confirm that the previous PvP cloaks are also scheduled for Season 3.<br />
<br />
Kalgan also explains why they're adding these new items.<br />
Early on we had a philosophy that we wouldn't put tanking gear or full sets of healing gear on the pvp vendors since at the time there were concerns that players would feel like it was advantageous to pvp in order to get gear to beat raid content.<br />
<br />
Turns out that philosophy mostly sucked (although we're holding onto the no-tanking gear part of it), so we fully itemize for healing in PvP gear now and rely on resilience to make it pvp-specific enough that it won't be considered ultimate raid gear.<br />
<br />
New Season 3 healing wand<br />
New wand for healers too, hurray.<br />
Would it help if I said there is a new healing wand for Season 3 Arena?<br />
<br />
Low level item changes in 2.3<br />
Yes, we're making updates to quite a few items for both instances and quests below level 60 in patch 2.3.<br />
<br />
Safe traveling to Zul'aman and Sunwell Plateau<br />
It seems that there will be a relatively safe way to travel to Zul'aman (and Sunwell plateau in 2.4) for alliance players on PvP realms.<br />
We do have plans in the works to make sure that we can get Alliance players access to this area and the Sunwell Plateau as well. Unfortunately, I can't give you any more information on this since there is still some work in progress in this regard.<br />
<br />
PvP realms will always have more activity in these hotspot areas no matter how you get there, but we will get you there just the same.<br />
<br />
More changes coming to Alterac Valley<br />
There are more changes scheduled, probably to fix the problem with horde/alliance win ratio.<br />
There are more changes coming for AV that we'll be talking about later. Hopefully we'll only be getting better. <br />
<br />
Engineer flying mount<br />
We currently don't plan to require Nether Vortices or a single Nether Vortex for the new Repair Bot or the Flying Mount.<br />
<br />
Kael'thas encounter bugged<br />
We looked into this, and found a new bug. Any of the enchanted weapons that are alive at the point when Prince Kael'thas resurrects his advisors will immediately have their health increased.<br />
<br />
We currently cannot hotfix this issue, but we hope to resolve the problem relatively soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Also...why not give us a little agility. All in all a step in the right direction for our itemization.</div></div><hr />

(I am playing a hunter as a twink)<br />
<br />
And the healer cloak... I am happy they finally implement it.<br />
<br />
Armor Bonus on S3.... I do not like this as a priest, hope the S3 cloth items will gain more additional armor than s2 :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think that it will be a staff, because it's called &quot;waraxe&quot;. but of course it has to be either low dps or extremely fast or both of it. like the funny caster onehanders in bt/hyjal with 41ish dps and an dmgrange of 2-140 or such.^^<br />
<br />
<br />
Safe traveling to Zul'aman and Sunwell Plateau:<br />
<br />
I think it will be working simular to the gnomeregan-access for horde players. you have to do a little quest, on its end you will recieve an item which will be needed to be in your inventory, so you can use a teleporter which teleports you damn nearly to the instance entry. can't imagine any other way that would not be relatively unfair in comparsion to horde. =D</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">leberle</div><div class="date">2007-09-29, 10:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">blizzard sometimes is realy stupid. they put &quot;no tanking gear&quot; in the same line as &quot;no prot pvp gear&quot;<br />
<br />
There are nice spec possibilitys in the prot and fury three to pvp successfull with a shield, but there is simply the gear missing for it to be viable in high end pvp. As soon as you have access to 3 Arena parts, MS gets a huge advantage from the gear you get so prot specs are on a downside. that goes on with every item you could get from arena.<br />
<br />
If there would be for example somthing like that prot arena set (same itemvalue as S2 arms set):<br />

It's in NO way viable for tanking high end raids, i don't even think it would be viable for 5 mans in non heroic mode, it is only good for that what it should be: prot pvp.<br />
<br />
Why does that suggestion not even looked at? Prot is realy fine for pvp when you get the right gear mix of PVP items (for resilience and stamina for survivability and a bit strength for rage gain) and blockvalue (for burst damage and melee resistance) and play it a bit different than a arms warrior in pvp.<br />
<br />
It would also be a first nice step if there where blockvalue gems (like 12 blockvalue gem for a red slot or/and 6blockvalue/6stamina gem as a purple (slot color wise) gem, so you could at least add your &quot;taste&quot; into the direction to the current availible PVP gear. <br />
<br />
And it would in NOOOOO WAAAY make it viable for tanking, only for pvp. Why does every threat that suggests that get ignored?<br />
<br />
arg, so frustrating for me and others, since i love to play with a shield and i love to play my current Prot/Fury spec in PVP, but i get 0 reward from PVPing....</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wildhorn</div><div class="date">2007-09-30, 07:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with leberle. I would like my prot warrior to be viable in PvP.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xebtria</div><div class="date">2007-10-01, 07:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also agree. the only problem I see, is: there are many warrior-newbs (not noobs, don't missunderstand^^), especially on my server, they even think, they can tank heroics with off-spec/talented... they would see those items as the perfect mixture of tanking gear and gear for damage (because it has crit, and critz &gt; all, and ofcourse it's epix, zomfG!). so all randomgroups (if they exist) for 5man/heroics/karazhan/gruul will surely be full of those gimped warriors. than all the flamethreads will ressourect (kinda: OmFg my warrior can nothing, as a tank he dies in about 173 milliseconds, and in teh damagmeters he's right in between the resto-druid and the holypala, plx fix it blizz!!11)... and well... warrior are back in their negative light... <br />
<br />
but the idea in general is pretty nice. my warrior would be happy too =D</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Legionn</div><div class="date">2007-10-01, 06:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well they need to do something about tanking gear cause we need to be doing more dmg than we are as a prot spec. One awesome crit from someone and it could wipe the raid, waisting time running all over the place trying to get back what was lost and most things are immune to taunt so that doesn't help. We need to be able to get some gear like a feral druid can with all the agility and crit so we can keep up with the heavy hitters.</div></div><hr />
