Q &amp; A<br />
<br />
Q: Are we going to see heritage armor for the older races?<br />
A: Nothing planned for now, but maybe in the future<br />
<br />
Q: Will the new idle animations shown in the trailers be given to player characters?<br />
A: The npcs are a test for now and maybe in the future it will be given to players as the animations are on the player models.<br />
<br />
Q: What kind of improvements were done to Zandalari armor?<br />
A: Dinosaur leather and gold chain mail are iconic in the new armor<br />
<br />
Q: What slows down the re-imagining of magic?<br />
A: Working to make sure each class uses magic differently. Want warlock shadow magic and priest shadow magic to feel different. Takes a lot of work.<br />
<br />
Q: How do you breathe life into the models in game?<br />
A: Team looks at a lot of real life creatures with similar anatomy. Things like murlocs are more idea orientated and comedic.<br />
<br />
Q: When are we getting hunter quivers?<br />
A: Jumped the gun on the announcement. When artifact system was decided, idea was put on hold. The conversation to move forward with it is happening now.<br />
<br />

<br />

A: Each Allied race has their own unique heritage armor models<br />

A: Many people see them as inappropriate but if it makes sense they might add more similar armor looks<br />

Q: Will head slots/hats be wearable with all hair styles?<br />
A: Too much of an undertaking to make all hair styles work with hat models<br />

A: Upright standing orcs are coming! Players will be able to toggle between classic hunched orc or straight standing<br />
<br />
Q: Where are worgen/goblin model updates?<br />
A: Right now not ready for Battle for Azeroth launch but definitely planned. They are being worked on!<br />

The people themselves. Slavs are hardy people, but also very religious compared to the Western Europe (if you've seen the panel yesterday, one of the Kul Tiras houses is hardcore religious).<br />

And even then, there's Slavic folklore, especially the crones and the spirit possessed nature construct.</div></div><hr />

However they still don't use most of the modern graphic effects, just models, textures and lights, not even gravity, motion capture or ragdoll effect.<br />
The game doesn't even needs them, it's fine and beautiful, but at the same time it consumes so much resource while running, that it overloads most of the systems on higher settings unreasonably.</div></div><hr />

I mean, &quot;hardy and religious&quot; could describe any European country during the 19th century. It's nothing that stands out in the slavic culture.<br />

Crones and spirits are common in every folklore. Just open up a book in Swedish folklore and you'd see the same. Even the devs said in the art panel that Kul Tiras is based on a lot of different marine cultures.</div></div><hr />

Don't think Zandalari trolls are confirmed Druids yet, that was just the audience member making an assumption. Alliance might get another Druid option with a future Allied Race if Highmountain tauren create an imbalance (honestly unlikely given how much more popular night elves and worgen are than taurine and trolls).<br />
<br />
Besides, it wouldn't really make sense for high elves to have Druids, let alone void elves. There's no tradition for it in their culture.</div></div><hr />

This was my question, and the shortened version here doesn't really give their response justice. They said it's hard to add them due to them being pretty divisive, but they were definitely looking to give us some more. When I passed one of the art guys in the hall later, he said they'd definitely work on it lol.</div></div><hr />

Don't forget the religious people and activists who get paid to write angry articles about the gaming industry :cool:<br />
Doubt many actual players would care, it's more about the look of the company. Art style-wise it's still a lot easier to add generally revealing clothing such as robes with cleavage and short shorts, than it is to add an actual (plate) bikini. The person who asked the question suggested it could be added to stuff liek the transmog competition holiday, which would be awesome. Would be the perfect time to add fun, colorful stuff as well as a platebikini and moggable fish weapons.<br />

Doubt many actual players would care, it's more about the look of the company. Art style-wise it's still a lot easier to add generally revealing clothing such as robes with cleavage and short shorts, than it is to add an actual (plate) bikini. The person who asked the question suggested it could be added to stuff liek the transmog competition holiday, which would be awesome. Would be the perfect time to add fun, colorful stuff as well as a platebikini and moggable fish weapons.<br />
<br />
And about druids, who knows - maybe an already existing Alliance race are going to get to be druids? Going to be interesting to see.<br />
<br />
Religious people (Christians at least) haven't been on a moral policing fit for a very long time. Even has an atheist I can recognize that. Western liberals are the responsible party.<br />
<br />
As for things like realism or whether it &quot;makes sense,&quot; if you're bringing realism into the argument were WoW is concerned you've already lost. Saying revealing plate armor isn't realistic next to pauldrons which belch fire or weapons bigger than the person wielding them is patently ridiculous. It betrays selective bias, not a logical argument.<br />
<br />
<br />
This was my question, and the shortened version here doesn't really give their response justice. They said it's hard to add them due to them being pretty divisive, but they were definitely looking to give us some more. When I passed one of the art guys in the hall later, he said they'd definitely work on it lol.<br />
<br />
Divisive is a pretty strong word when most everyone, man or woman, who rolls a female character wears it. Sounds like a corporate non-answer, but at least they don't sound entirely cucked in their design choices.</div></div><hr />

The guy on stage said &quot;it's something you can look at and say 'yeah, I could use that in real life'&quot;. If the blade was smaller and not sharp on its inner edge, I'd agree.<br />
<br />
It's amazing how something that essentially was meant as a quip can be taken as a genuine gripe.</div></div><hr />

Art-style does not equal realism. Maybe it's different in the US, over here religious people are still loud in various media outlets. People make big money on attacking companies for these things, and even christian conservatives love easy money.</div></div><hr />

There's no problem. I just think it was weird/funny he said it could be practical in real life with a bayonet that oversized attached to it.<br />

That was my entire point. People argue you can't have so called &quot;bikini plate&quot; for two reasons: implied (ie: imaginary) sexism, or because it's not &quot;realistic.&quot; The sexism argument has always been patently false. The realism argument hinges on the idea that art has to be a 1:1 of reality in order to be good. Realism in art design is not a requirement, it's a suggestion. One the artist can freely ignore. Some of the best stories ever told completely lack a realistic aesthetic.<br />
<br />
TL;DR - The people against &quot;bikini plate&quot; are either paranoid about made up social issues or lack a complete understanding of the creative process. There is no good argument for why it can't be utilized as a design aesthetic.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
But Christian conservatives are not responsible for the current moral panic and content policing. Progressive leftists are. Conservatives have by and large been out of trying to police content creators for a long time now.</div></div><hr />

As long as they keep them away from tier sets I'm happy. (I'm still 'mad' about the Radiant Glory chestpiece)</div></div><hr />

You still don't seem to realize the artstyle argument. It does not have anything to do with sexism or realism. It's about the overall presentation of the world they want to create. They themselves say it just wouldn't fit in very well with the rest of their designs.<br />
<br />
You haven't seen how they use the progressive left as a &quot;warning example&quot; to people if they abandon God, and so on? The conservatives love the liberals, they work very well together in dividing people into two distinct groups. It's all just a game to control the masses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And demanding it be implemented because you subjectively like it isn't? Right back at ya, by the way: transmog your crappy slutmogs and leave the plate tiers alone. <br />
<br />
Tiers are supposed to look elaborate and detailed. &quot;Platekini&quot; is as uncreative and unimaginative as it gets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just because the artist said it doesn't mean the artist is right. Disney could have said, &quot;Lightsabers don't fit into Star Wars' aesthetic&quot; when they acquired Lucasfilm, but that wouldn't make them correct. The artist who said this compared to WoW's own aesthetic is simply wrong. Their position of authority does not change this fact.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
But I'm not demanding anything, am I? I'm stating simple objective truths. There's tons of armor sets I dislike in WoW. I simply don't use them, because the systems in place mean you're not forced to wear anything you don't like. That tier did look elaborate and detailed, and &quot;platekinis&quot; as you call them are no more uncreative and unimaginative than any other design. Stop using shallow buzzwords. It's obvious and shows you're not trying to argue in good faith.</div></div><hr />

An accurate description is not a generalization. If it hits too close to home for you, that's your problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
Neither is trying to pass off your very subjective opinion as objective fact.<br />
<br />
Your inability to accept the truth does not validate your emotional appeal. You aren't forced to wear any armor you don't want to in WoW. Is this not truth? Does transmogging not exist all of a sudden because someone designed armor which triggered you? Equally, the fact is that no idea is uncreative or unimaginative. Only the execution of that idea. Armor regardless of how covering can be well or poorly designed. There is no such thing as a bad idea in art, and policing ideas says more about your abhorrent views of artistic liberty than it does about me trying to project subjectives as truth.<br />
<br />
<br />

Thank you for conceding the point and admitting you have no argument worth making. I accept.</div></div><hr />

Yes regardless of what armor type they can wear, so for example a Dark Iron Dwarf would be able to don a full plate set even as a spellcaster.</div></div><hr />
