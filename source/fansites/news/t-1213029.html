<br />
Considering that lynx rush was doing 15-20k PER HIT (so 20k x 9 = 180k dmg) for my BM specced half heroic dung geared hunter that nerf is quite significant since the stats are 1,000 bleed damage over 15 seconds stacking 9 times. thats 9k damage over 15 seconds. Pathetic.</div></div><hr />

The only pathetic thing here is you didn't factor in attack power contributions to that bleed, you think current lynx rush has much more than 1k base damage on it?</div></div><hr />

Ice barrier dmg reduction, deep freece cd increase, combustion only does dmg based on the ignite (better only use it if your pyro crits now... no reason for even taking the living bomb talent now)...<br />
<br />
O, and water jet for our pet... really... like anyone's going to stand in front of that. They're either standing in front of us or behind us, and our pet is to our side (not to mention, if we're doing our job as a mage, we're casting from afar/kiting, and not in range to hit them with a cone from our pet...)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spellsteal, as a Disc priest, needed to eat a nerf. That's fine; but no corresponding Resto Druid nerf makes the already best healer in PvP considerably better.<br />
<br />
No warrior nerfs. This class replaced Hunters are the most broken class in PvP awhile ago.<br />
<br />
Disc Priest nerfs? Worst Class in pvp by a long shot now that rogues have been fixed. <br />
<br />
Also, Chaos bolt is even better now? Nice. Randomly one shotting people is fun, right...for the warlock.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But DO MY EYES DECEIVE ME?! MAGE NERFS?! I THOUGHT I'D NEVER LIVE TO SEE THE DAY. They better not go back on them. None of them gut the mage class in either PvP or PvE and only help to tone them down. And don't worry folks, warrior nerfs are coming. We all know it.<br />
<br />
I'd have to say that once the warrior nerfs are in, this will be the greatest pvp balance patch of all time. OF ALL TIME!</div></div><hr />

Fire already lost some of it's awesomeness, now that you have more control over the Pyroblast! procs and it's no longer a surprise when you get it. It does fix the crap RNG part where you can go 50 Fireballs without ever getting two crits in a row. So, overall, the MoP Fire Mage &gt; Cataclysm Fire Mage. Actually just found out an amazing combo for Fire using Alter Time and Presence of Mind. Awesome for PVE and I guess overpowered for PVP. But Jesus, a cooldown on Pyroblast? This is not the way to nerf Fire Mages. I'm not happy about damage reductions, but if a nerf is really required, for f's sake, lower the damage increase on Pyroblast! to 15% or something. <br />
<br />
I haven't been having a lot of fun on my Mage, ever since Cataclysm was released. Just today I started to love it again, using that new awesome combo with Alter Time and Presence of Mind, only to be heavely dissapointed again after reading the 5.1 patch notes. The combo is dead. As rare as two Pyroblast! procs in a row are, now we won't even be able to use them quickly anymore either. This will break Fire Mage. If this goes live, I will bench my Mage. <br />
<br />
Of course, it's not set it stone, but the fact that Blizzard is considering a f'ed up nerf like this, shows Fire Mages are in trouble.</div></div><hr />

At least your entire spec wasn't redesigned into a mindless game of whack-a-mole like Frost PvE. It was bad enough getting a pet in TBC, now we have a damn maintenance spell (bombs) too.

<br />
It's not a cone AoE ability, it's a channeled ability like Mindflay or Malefic Grasp. It will help Frost Mage PvE damage by granting them additional Fingers of Frost procs, and probably won't find too many uses in PvP with the shared CD on Freeze.</div></div><hr />

Aye true, well if this goes live and it _DOES_ affect Pyroblast! It'll be a nerf for sure. Not game breaking, but one has to hold a bit on Inferno Blasts in order not to waste the Pyroblast! My main concern is that double pyro procs will be removed, making it somewhat harder for a good burn on e.g. sparks on Elegon. :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm fairly certain this would be a more direct nerf to MistWeaver Monks. They don't need to use the brews so often, but 10% is alot for a healer.<br />
WindWalkers and BrewMasters on the other hand could really use more healing. 10% hp (when brews are available) is kind of lack luster compared to that of other classes. what's a 30k heal or so every 18 seconds vs say Warriors Second Wind (3% life returned a sec once below 35% health) or even enhance shamans MW5 insta heal (you shammies know what you've seen your insta heals do, coupled with a proc of another instant heal.. that's a shit tonne of healing). Really, each classes self healing is pretty high, and the best we've seen for WW monks is a sly 20k heal that takes 1/2 of your energy to create a crappy chi sphere, chi wave that will more than likely not hit more than 14k - and is bugged so will sometimes only leap a couple of times, and a CD that is our only good healing (expel harm) which is on a pretty high CD. The heal from Blackout kick is extremely low also, 20% of the damage done if standing in front of the target. But even then the damage in PVP for instance is not particularly high due to resilience.<br />
I really enjoy Monk, and have mained it since MoP launched - but there needs to be some changes to the design of the class to bring it up to par with the other classes.</div></div><hr />

Pathetic.<br />
<br />
I bet lynx rush will still do the same damage, but just slower. They wouldn't nerf it because BM isn't doing that great in pve to begin with. We'll have to see the numbers first. The 1k thing is baseline ofc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They made hunter pets CCable during Bestial Wrath. It will likely be viable to just CC and kill pets! They can stun the pet JUST as you use Bestial Wrath, and your Lynx Rush will apply maybe 1-2 wounds instead of 9. The burst would be killed.<br />
<br />
This whole thing about Lynx Rush being a wound effect is most likely a hidden nerf.<br />
<br />
All of this is just speculations. We'll see what happens. Hopefully they'll make Heart of the Phoenix a skill all pets have, not just ferocity, and they should also give a passive CC time reduction, of maybe 50%.</div></div><hr />

Triple pyro chain was a nonsense for combustion as the pyroblast debuff only lasts 4 secs so when the combu hits the first pyroblast debuff is gone.</div></div><hr />

Actually the problem is they haven't made it clear. They like to string people along by making claims that they care and will balance it and then they don't. They actually made a big deal about the work they put into pvp this expansion, so people have the right to be mad.</div></div><hr />

Ya they want all the PvP'ers to keep playing. I just think the magnitude of PvE content dwarfs the PvP content, which brings me to the conclusion that PvP is not nor ever has been a priority.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Chaos bolt needs to be toned down a little so that it doesnt cause so much burst in PVP, in compensation embers generation should be a little higher. All in all warlocks should be able to chaos bolt more often but with less damage in one go.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hunters:<br />
<br />
Massive nerf to BM, but was needed. Also please don't just say &quot;HUNTERS ARE OP!&quot;. Only BM was bursting like hell. Survival is mediocre in PVP and Marksmanship is terrible in PVP and PVE. One spec doing good doesnt mean the whole class is doing good or OP.<br />
<br />
Cobra/steady castable while moving makes hunters a true mobile ranged class. Should be quite fun. I don't expect SV nor MM to be OP in PVE or PVP after this change simply because their burst and sustained is not realy amazing atm, BM after this nerfs we shall see...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thalin</div><div class="date">2012-10-19, 05:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's what the hunter changes equate to:<br />
<br />
Aspect of the Fox removal - Small quality of life change, any hunter worth their salt easily swapped Fox and Hawk without a need for macros. This will net small dps gains for some players and nothing for others.<br />
<br />
Lynx Rush damage converted to bleed - Huge burst dps reduction. Previously this was damn near impossible to heal through especially when pair with a readiness and another lynx rush. Now with the damage spread over more time it will be easy to heal through and I'd be surprised if any PVP hunter sticks with this over Blink Strike.<br />
<br />
Beastial Wrath CC'able - Another Huge dps nerf to BM hunters for the sake of pvp. Big red pet on you? No biggie, CC that pet and /point /laugh at the hunter.<br />
<br />
MoP Hunters need a serious looking at on both the PVE and PVP sides of the fence. I'm not sure what the f@ck Blizz class devs are smoking these days. While the new abilities go a long way to make the hunter feel like more of a pet class, the Cooldown management and sheer number of abilities are a f@cking mess for every spec.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kharyll</div><div class="date">2012-10-19, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a hunter that hates playing the BM spec, I welcome these changes warmly.<br />
MoP made the class only about beasts, MM and SV were neglected a lot in the shadow of BM. Now that BM is nerfed, we can finally see how the class with all of its 3 spec fares.</div></div><hr />

Flavor of the month kiddies reroll warrior now and you might get a few more weeks in before you have to switch again. You're going to be falling behind on gear though.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's so funny.. I liked Burst of Speed but 60 energy was too much for an energy starved class. I think I have to take it at 50 energy though. Great modification. Bring on the haste Ghostcrawler!<br />

That was my favorite thing! (Yeah because it was OP) Especially during a Deep Freeze<br />
Hunter gets some nice changes, quality of life, and dissuading the faceroll BM style.<br />
Rogues getting these changes are so stupid, not because they aren't needed, but I read threads about how Rogues will have trouble in MoP everyday during the Beta and Blizz was all like 'we'll see... we'll see..&quot;</div></div><hr />

Either in PvP or PvE. Pyroblast and Pyroblast! Isn't even the same.<br />
<br />
Yes they are... there is no such thing as Pyroblast! since 5.0.5. Pve will suffer from pvp nerf thanks blizzard really. They posted some bluepost that it wont affect pve like &quot;just cast 1 pyro between 2 pyros&quot;, I'm really surprised that they actually dont know how ignite and combustion works. Haste reducing pyro's cd was their another excuse yeah we have so much room for haste apart from crit. Haste will barely reduce cd by 0.5 sec (%17 haste).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warriors deserve to be OP after being nerfed in almost the whole season of Cata. Maybe nerf the Dragons roar but thats about it. I think even though i play one Resto druids need a nerf there mana does not move. everything else is good imo. I do believe that rogues do not need the blind buff they just need a buff on survivability.</div></div><hr />
