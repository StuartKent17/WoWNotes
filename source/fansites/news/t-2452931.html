It's also kinda hard to keep track of it though, because the same nerf/change tends to be reported on multiple times. First there's a twitter post, then MMO-C posts that twitter post, then a few days later it shows up in a list of hotfixes, and maybe a few weeks later it shows up in official patch notes. The line between something old being listed again, and something new being reported is very much a blur.</div></div><hr />

I'm guessing blizzard has some sort of benchmark for how many guilds achieve CE every tier and tune accordingly. &quot;Free CE's for everyone&quot; is an over exaggeration, a hc guild wont be able to clear mythic due to these nerfs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Herald of the Titans achievement can only be obtained by level appropriate players (80) wearing appropriate gear (used to be 226+232 weapons). With recent item squish, they had to adjust old bosses and it seems that Algalon was somewhat overtuned for players who tried to obtain the achievement.<br />
With this nerf, he shall now be known, once again, as AlgaLoL.</div></div><hr />

Who cares if bad players get CE? As far as a lot of players are concerned, if you don't have CE by now you don't deserve it, you got the nerf of 10 RA stacks and a ton of gear, whole raid is significantly easier now than it was before. <br />
But CE doesn't matter, top 100 is a totally different world to top 500, they aren't seen as anywhere near equal just because they got a little achievement. That's all it is, a meaningless achievement. World rank means much more.</div></div><hr />

Grievous actually hasn't changed much, wowhead has a good analysis showing that this change basically does nothing, because ticks are larger now... So grievous is still extremely overtuned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah? You think buffing grievous is really nice? Not sure that affix is one that should have been made harder, but I'm assuming you just read it as they removed a stack so it's automatically easier? Might be worth looking into it, it's actually harder now.</div></div><hr />

Both this and wowhead sites are impossible on mobile (tons of redirecting adds to scam sites, auto-play music/video adds and all those dirty tricks they use to capture the clicks on your screen way over the designated add area).

Bad players will never get that.<br />
<br />
People working on Mythic Uldir are far from bad. Bad players will never kill theses bosses even with nerfs. It's not the same kind of nerf like Firelands where you out of nowhere could kill everything with far less than the intended ilvl thanks to the massive nerfs that made you ignore the mechanics (and get stuck at Heroic Ragnaros because they didn't nerf him).<br />
<br />
&quot;Bad&quot; players will maybe kill Taloc/Mother, but they won't be able to kill the rest with that kind of nerf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Completely depends on your definition of a bad player. I think someone who can't follow their rotation at even the most basic level, someone who can't handle mechanics, can't remember to enchant their weapon, can't understand how a boss works and wipes their raid countless times due to not being able to do a simple job like run an orb, I think those players are bad players. And those players definitely can and have already gotten CE. <br />
<br />
Just because you're 8/8M now, doesn't automatically mean you have even the slightest idea how to play your spec or know how mechanics work. <br />
<br />
If you suck at playing your spec and doing mechanics, you aren't good, you aren't okay, you're bad. There's different levels of bad, for sure. But you can be 8/8M and be bad, just like you can be 8/8H and be bad.<br />
<br />
And that's 8/8M players, imagine how much worse 7/8+6/8M players can be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Grievous is percentage based and has been nerfed several times since it was introduced. A tick is every three seconds. When it first appeared on 7.2 PTR, it was 5% per stack, then 4%, then was released live at 3.5%. 7.2.5 changed it to 2.5%, then 8.0.1 made it 2%. Now with only 4 stacks, grievous deals a max of 8% of your health every 3 seconds instead of 10%, instead of 12.5% before BfA, and instead of 17.5% when it first came out.<br />
<br />
7.2: 5 stacks of 3.5%<br />
7.2.5: 5 stacks of 2.5%<br />
8.0.1: 5 stacks of 2%<br />
hotfix: 4 stacks of 2%</div></div><hr />

Just because you're 8/8M now, doesn't automatically mean you have even the slightest idea how to play your spec or know how mechanics work. <br />
<br />
If you suck at playing your spec and doing mechanics, you aren't good, you aren't okay, you're bad. There's different levels of bad, for sure. But you can be 8/8M and be bad, just like you can be 8/8H and be bad.<br />
<br />
And that's 8/8M players, imagine how much worse 7/8+6/8M players can be.<br />
<br />
Dude, you're so out of touch...<br />
<br />
There's not one player (unless carried) who killed M G'huun and applies for your definition of bad. The kind of player you describe are the ones struggling with G’huun HEROIC! Maybe they are even 1/8 or 2/8 but certainly not capable of killing Vectis, Zek’voz or Fetid on Mythic. The people killing these bosses are for sure proper enchanted and have even a little bit of a clue of how to play their class/rotation/mechanics.</div></div><hr />

I think someone who can't follow their rotation at even the most basic level, someone who can't handle mechanics, can't remember to enchant their weapon, can't understand how a boss works and wipes their raid countless times due to not being able to do a simple job like run an orb, I think those players are bad players. And those players definitely can and have already gotten CE. <br />

This reminds me of a certain Tinder-research which showed that women think ~70% of men are BELOW AVERAGE looking.<br />
Which is, by definition, a statistical fallacy.<br />

I don't even play retail so I don't go to gold selling websites.<br />
<br />
In this day and age, why would ANYONE buy gold from a third party when you can safely do it in game without repercussion..?</div></div><hr />
