Official site teaser/splash screen - Day 5<br />
This is the last day before the WWI, the eyes in the middle of the screen really start to look like the Lich King's ... However the creature artwork has been fully uploaded (we're not sure if it's an error or not) and we now have the full picture (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/june/creatureartwork.jpg) available. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/june/splashscreen5_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/june/splashscreen5.jpg)<br />

<br />
The splash screen<br />
This is the most obvious part of the teaser, a huge picture of a block of ice slowly cracking to reveal what seems to be a face. Each day a rune was added to the ice.<br />
Day 1 - The first rune looks a lot like the one found on the Lich King swords in many official artworks. <br />
Day 2 - The 2nd rune is the Hel Rune from Diablo 2<br />
Day 3 - The 3rd rune is the Protoss Symbol found on the Starcraft 2 official site (http://www.starcraft2.com/features/)<br />
Day 4 - The 4th rune hasn't been identified yet, and what looks like the eyes of the lich king appeared in the center of the ice crack. <br />
Day 5 - A new rune has been added and looks like a viking compass. The eyes started to glow, the creature artwork from the CSS files is now complete. The runes also started to glow, you can compare these screenshots : Screenshot #1 (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/june/splashfinal.jpg) / Screenshot #2 (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/june/splashfinal2.jpg)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/june/splashlast_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/june/splashfinal2.jpg)<br />
<br />
The &quot;hidden&quot; artwork<br />
If you check the CSS File (http://us.media.blizzard.com/232309/master.css) of the page, you'll notice a few commented lines pointing to image links. <br />
<br />
/*.tundra {background:url(_images/04.jpg) no-repeat 0 0} */<br />
/*.harbinger {background:url(_images/08.jpg) no-repeat 0 0} */<br />
/*.cold {background:url(_images/16.jpg) no-repeat 0 0} */<br />
/*.cavern {background:url(_images/15.jpg) no-repeat 0 0} */<br />
/*.icy {background:url(_images/23.jpg) no-repeat 0 0} */<br />
/*.evilpenguin {background:url(_images/42.jpg) no-repeat 0 0} */<br />
<br />
There was a few theories about these pictures, people tried to replace the number of each pictures with letter to see if it would form &quot;Diablo&quot; in the end but it didn't work. Obviously there are many links between &quot;icy&quot;, &quot;tundra&quot;, &quot;cavern&quot;, &quot;cold&quot;, and Wrath of the Lich King / Diablo 2 and we can't confirm anything based on these names. <br />
<br />
However, now the link with the Numbers from Lost (http://www.lostpedia.com/wiki/The_Numbers) is definitely proven.<br />
<br />

Conclusion<br />
Still Diablo 3, and you won't get any more proof until it's announced tomorrow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This, like most theories, is a bit of a leap, however one of the new images<br />
<br />
./*.harbinger {background:url(_images/08.jpg) no-repeat 0 0} */<br />
<br />
Harbinger, the title of an older game:<br />
http://www.ugo.com/channels/games/features/harbinger/review.asp<br />
<br />
<br />
It's been said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. It's also been said that Harbinger promises to imitate the look, play and potentially the success of the Diablo games from Blizzard.<br />
<br />
http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519NN91YHBL._SS400_.jpg<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, another huge stretch, is when running &quot;Evil Penguin&quot; through an Anagram Solver, the longest word found is &quot;UNVEILING&quot; leaving the P and an E unused.</div></div><hr />

He fills me in on EVERYTHING that goes on there from WotLK News to news about Blizzard, like how some of their members quit. Well, my friend gave me a couple hints about the splash page until I got the right answer. My friend confirmed my answer, and even showed my a small preview. And now I am willing to tell you guys what the splash means...<br />
<br />
The splash will reveal that Blizzard is working on the development of a &quot;cow level&quot;. Yes, a &quot;cow level&quot;. Whenever you are playing WoW, on the loading screens you see those tips. You know how that one says &quot; There is no cow level.&quot; ?....That's about to change my friends. That's about to change.</div></div><hr />

Its called Thunderbluff<br />
<br />
<br />
Not that it is too important or anything but while you say it looks like &quot;ice&quot; imo it looks ALOT like crystals. Mainly the ones on the walls in the Terrace of Light in Shattrath (I dont know if my comptuer seems washed out but it looks almost identical to me. Just a side thought &quot;=) )<br />
<br />
Ice is more consistant with Blizzard and their gameplan, why move back to Shatt when you can move forward to Northrend.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The eyes also resemble Diablo. The V shaped brow. Yes the glowing resembles Arthas more I agree. Could be done on purpose to leave us hanging. Why go through all this if it's clearly going to be Arthas and thus WotLK before we reach the conclusion. It's obviously made to be vague.<br />
<br />
Diabloii.net has confirmed it to be Diablo 3 going to be announced. I don't buy it but there's some hope to hold on to if you need it.<br />
<br />
The runes are from every franchise and Bliz's logo. Why show us old franchise runes unless you're trying to confuse us or introduce a new IP. &quot;hey look what great old games we made, try out our new one&quot;<br />
<br />
There's a lot pointing towards Diablo 3 IMO but I have no expectations at this point, it's up in the air and I think that's how they want it. I'm sure if it's WotLK people will say &quot;see told you&quot; but then again I still don't see why they would go through this tease for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
now i'm just convinced even more it will be WOTLK related (imo official release date announcement) It just makes sense and if you look at his eyes compared to the arthas picture on the WOTLK info link on the WOW site it's practically identical. Plus you can see the little crease between the eyes which is placed and sized (what looks to me to be identical) to the Arthas pic in the fore mentioned link.<br />
<br />
<br />
Could be wrong but it just seems so obvious as far as the time this screen started and the release of the final season of BC arena and the final instance being old news at this point.<br />

anyways the more I look at the eyes the more I get the feeling it's actualy Tassadar<br />

yes he's got a more rounded forhead... but it could be in body armor? rest of the face somewhat fits<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aichon</div><div class="date">2008-06-27, 08:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Definitely not Zeratul, incidentally. Just check it against the wallpaper that was released of Zeratul jumping a few months back. He has two lobes in front, and no crest on his brow like we see with those eyes. And the Lich King doesn't seem right either because of that crest. As was stated, the bridge across his brow is flat, not pointed, and Blizzard is too meticulous to flub a detail like that. They've been releasing consistent artwork on him for awhile now, and I doubt they would change it now, since even small changes like that are big deals.<br />
<br />
Also, you can see what appears to be part of the edge of the face on the left side of the area where the face is (it would be the creature's right cheek). Looks more like a Protoss in conformation. That said, some of the Protoss seem possible, but that crest looks like a bony protrusion, not a piece of armor, and none of the Protoss, from what I can tell, seem to have that sort of growth.<br />
<br />

well as I said 4309581049865 times before, Diablo dies in 2 :P non-ressurectable dies :P so well sure I see the possibility of it being him... but I surely hope not<br />

i agree. the splash screen eyes are more curved and elf/sprite like. Not human/arthus rigid eye shape.<br />
<br />
it's more a fantasy race/creature/demon than deathknight</div></div><hr />

Everyone here should know that Blizzard is making a next-gen MMO. http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3168513730&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=1 for starters.<br />
<br />
Starcraft II _and_ a Starcraft MMO? I find this hard to believe.<br />
<br />
The first thing I thought of when I saw the new splash was Diablo. That is still up in the air in my mind.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be surprised if it isn't any of the above. Something new? What is the fourth rune? Three runes and an unknown fourth simply points to something new. The fifth is just Blizzard, at the top. <br />
<br />
Main point is they want you to think it's the lich king, so I'm betting against that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you look at it, it is very convincing that it is the lich king.<br />
<br />
Arguments FOR it:<br />
<br />
If you compare the eye distance it looks closer together than seen on the splash, which is why the brow in the middle is thinner than on the picture of the lich king. Also, we can see the &quot;lines&quot; under neigh the eyes, shown by the red arrows, yes some of you might say the left is a little to far over but still, it is very, very similar.<br />
<br />
Also, if we look at the part marked purple, we can see that the glow each sides of the eyes are shown on both pictures :D and if we look closely, we can see a small crack on each picture in the &quot;glow&quot;, although the crack on the lich king picture is significantly larger.<br />
<br />
Arguments AGAINST it:<br />
<br />
All i can see is the part marked by the green circle. There are two vertical lines each side in between the eyes (in the green circle), and on the picture of the lich king, there is none.<br />
<br />
Overall, my opinion is its the lich king taking into consideration my own observations.. It might just look different because it might have been done by a different artist.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Look at this image and see how it totally doesn't match. The bottom comparison is what the helmet would need to look like to match the splash image.<br />

well the scene between end diablo 2 -&gt; start lord of destruction... clearly explains how and why the soulstone was destroyed of Diablo<br />
<br />
indeed LoD ends with a &quot;unknown&quot; ending..anything could have happend..but bringing back Diablo this way would just be plain wrong... I've seen soap opera's bring back dead characters with better story then :P <br />
<br />
as i stated before, could be Zeratul who was taken over by Zerg, as happend with Kerrigan... could be a new race, the Xel'Naga for example would resemble a mixture of protoss and zerg (would explain the boney crest now wouldn't it?)<br />
<br />
<br />
Baahl, possible...but wouldn't make it a &quot;diablo&quot; game.. .would make it &quot;baahl&quot;... I could ofc live with a spin off..but in the end it's all the same: milking a franchise they put to rest earlier..</div></div><hr />

The light blue that forms V might be his fless torn apart where the crystal strikes out.<br />

<br />
the edges of the eyes are kinda round in the splash, arthas ees arent. (im no native english speaker sry :( )<br />
<br />
they look more &quot;natural&quot; to me and not covered by a helmet .. at least not the eyes, the head maybe is i dont know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just made it more clear by slapping some lines into paint. <br />
Look at the image I quoted. That one has the pentagram perfectly lined out.<br />
<br />
(IsIkke)Edit: And still, the face doesnt -have- to be in the perfect center. Sure, it looks more appealing, but merely displaying a pentagram itself is 'diabolic' enough. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just tested in paint myself, 1 line of the pentagram clearly crosses one of the eyes... so this kinda &quot;proves&quot; the pentagram has nothing to do with it<br />
<br />
if it was related, it would have &quot;most likely&quot; had the face in the center..<br />

here the findings on the pentagram<br />
<br />
as you can clearly see, it's crossing one eye... <br />
<br />
you WOULD expect the face to center the pentagram... <br />
<br />
and besides that: the pentagram has the wrong side up...</div></div><hr />

<br />
well ... I just thought up something:<br />
<br />
We have seen images of Starcraft 2 with Tassadar right? well didn't he die in SC:BW? <br />
<br />
Ok we know units lost from Protoss will get reincarnated in Dragoons... but well we see him full face... <br />
<br />
Hence I suspect we now see Tassadar actualy... and again: as Zerg... it would make sense</div></div><hr />

The one on the right is Kerrigan from Starcraft suggesting some sort of relevance between Starcraft and WWI and as we all know Starcraft 2 is already known.<br />
<br />
The one on the left is Prince Arthas and as we all know Arthas is the main story of WOLK<br />
<br />
The one in the middle is... or should I say, looks very VERY V E R Y!!! much like diablo and I find it interesting that the fire coming from in between his fingers looks very much like III. could the mystery be solved? could it be that blizzard is really going to be coming out with the third installment of Diablo???</div></div><hr />

The eyes/face will need to move up as the object comes closer to reveal the entire face imho. The center of the pentagram when drawn is pretty much the center of the area of the opening. They could make it work without melting the ice any further. I honestly doubt this to be the case, but it's very doable.</div></div><hr />

The whole idea of a pentagram is the symmetry, this is just a 5 pointed star. You can't just connect any five endpoints and call it a pentagram. Well, if you look at the true meaning of the word, it is a pentagram (that just means 5 points), but it's not what is meant when we talk about a pentagram.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glomp</div><div class="date">2008-06-27, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well look at it this way, the image has characteristics from pretty much all of Blizzards games. This isn't surprising since most companies like to show off their creations. I'm more or less gonna say that the final image will have Arthas breaking out of the ice, advertising WotLK, since it is one of their latest products. Sure we know about it, but thats just us, they aren't going to not advertise it because the people who play WoW already know about it. Their plan was to get you guys to talk about new products and WWI, it worked. Sure they may not have done it in the past, that just makes it more likely they want to try something else.<br />
<br />
Also as I said before, it would be nice if it was a trick at the end. So that both a Protoss and The Lich King break out of the ice, it would work if you think about it. Since it looks like The Lich King and a Protoss. We find out tomorrow anyway.</div></div><hr />

Isn't it obvious? It's not that hard to guess guys. We'll, I'll let you guys on a secret. My friend who I've grown up with and we are still best friends, works a Blizzard. He fills me in on EVERYTHING that goes on there from WotLK News to news about Blizzard, like how some of their members quit. Well, my friend gave me a couple hints about the splash page until I got the right answer. My friend confirmed my answer, and even showed my a small preview. And now I am willing to tell you guys what the splash means...<br />
<br />
The splash will reveal that Blizzard is working on the development of a &quot;cow level&quot;. Yes, a &quot;cow level&quot;. Whenever you are playing WoW, on the loading screens you see those tips. You know how that one says &quot; There is no cow level.&quot; ?....That's about to change my friends. That's about to change.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well I don't know what to believe anymore, almost anything seems possible at the moment. But what I did happen to notice was that the image actually does look like a cow! (with glowing eyes for some weird reason &lt;.&lt;)<br />
<br />
If you zoom out of the picture, it's alot easier to see it<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/june/splashscreen5.jpg<br />
Look at that link, while the image is zoomed out<br />
<br />
I dont know about you, but I see a cow with glowing eyes and horns, I can also see it's nose, with the cold air coming out of it.<br />

Who knows whats behind the ice? Personally I think these are Lich King eyes, but who said there won't be anything about Diablo? Maybe they show Arthas first, because it will be the main event on WWI, but also not only. So I wish that WWI will be the annoucement for three, awesome, legendary games.

<br />
Who knows whats behind the ice? Personally I think these are Lich King eyes, but who said there won't be anything about Diablo? Maybe they show Arthas first, because it will be the main event on WWI, but also not only. So I wish that WWI will be the annoucement for three, awesome, legendary games. Wotlk, Diablo and Starcraft.<br />
Just my 2 words.<br />
<br />
<br />
well the thing for me is: Diablo == dead... end of story... <br />
great game for sure... but ....well.. even good things come to an end.<br />
that's the thing Diablo fans appearantly can't cope with... <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
yes I do see the chance for it to be D3, but well storywise... plain bad.<br />
<br />
with this I &quot;hope&quot; it's not D3, and thus look into other 2 options:<br />
WotLK or SC2 (or a new franchise)<br />
<br />
SC2, is most likely for me.. seeing my theory on Tassadar<br />
WotLK, well yeh the eyes do fit somewhat in the Lichking's eyes</div></div><hr />

Perhaps the great leader of the blue dragonflight is going to make an appearance at WWI to some degree? After all he is meant to be living in Northrend, perhaps the brow parts starting to show in the Blizzard Splash aren't Diablo's or the Lich Kings, but Malygos.. <br />
<br />
I feel WotLK will be a lot about magic, and good versus evil, the dragonflights have always been around to aid good in zones of terror, perhaps now is the time for the blue dragonflight?</div></div><hr />

I think they meant something really new. Not a release date or something similar uninteresting compared to gamemechanics or even new games. <br />
<br />
we have a few hints like the splash screen mystery, the name &quot;hydra&quot; an a few quotes from the past.<br />
<br />
the eyes in the splashscreen are very blizzardish and could be found in any game, the runes connect to different products, even the the icy theme could be easiliy connected to every mayor franchise.<br />
<br />
i think we shouldn´t try to see to much in the splash.<br />
<br />
so lets thinks about the new thing without the screen, perhaps we can connect our thoughts with the splas after the brainstorming.<br />
_______________<br />
<br />
/brainstorming mode on<br />
<br />
&quot;hydra&quot; - the hydra is a multiheaded mythical creature with heads that regrow after decapacitation - could mean alot. something coming back, regrowing, more heads. - diablo coming back / a new race for starcraft 2 (more heads) / a crossover new franchise (one body a lot of heads)<br />
<br />
what would be called new blizzard related?<br />
- a brand new franchise<br />
- a new diablo related game (diablo 3 or mmorpg in the diablo universe)<br />
- a starcraft mmorpg (starcraft 2 wouldn´t be new)<br />
- warcraft 4<br />
- the warcraft movie (not officially announced so far)<br />
- return of starcraft ghost<br />
- something wotlk related and new (second prestige class, new races, inter faction interaction, some very interesting story that will dominate wotlk storyline - like arthas struggeling against the dominion of the lich king,...)<br />
- a cinematic for wotlk or starcraft 2<br />
<br />
/brainstorming mode off<br />
<br />
perhaps you can work with my thoughts. hopefully my english ist understandable.</div></div><hr />

1. Wrath of the Lich King is Blizzards big thing right now. Why would they release another game to take the hype away from that?<br />

3. Yes the image is a dead ringer for everyone's favorite evil backstabbing ex paladin with his helmet on. You're comparing current artwork of him against it..

Conclusion: IT's the LK, but the announcement might not have anything to do with him or WotLK. It could be about more than one game as i said yesterday.<br />

Notice the eyebrows, and that the splash picture is more skin-like than plate-like. You can almost see horns at the sides of the eyes. All of it doesn't match.<br />
But as some have stated, it might just be an unrevealed and new artwork of Arthas or something, or it can be the demons of Diablo or Malygos etc.</div></div><hr />

Ye only Warcraft related sites from Blizzard has the splash screens...<br />
