Warlords of Draenor - Stormwind Repairs<br />
It looks like the previously mentioned Stormwind Repairs (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4056-Stormwind-Repairs-Reagent-Bank-Blueprint-Prices-New-Quests-and-Items-Hogger-Pet) won't make it in this expansion after all.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor - Garrisons: Stables<br />
The Stables (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/67-stables) takes up a Large plot which can also be used for a Mage Tower / Spirit Lodge (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/39-mage-tower), Gnomish Gearworks / Goblin Workshop (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/164-gnomish-gearworks), Dwarven Bunker / War Mill (http://www.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/8-dwarven-bunker), or Barracks (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/28-barracks). Once upgraded to Tier 3, your garrison will have two Large plots available.<br />
<br />
Abilities<br />
This building is good for collecting additional mounts, moving faster in Draenor, and gathering faster in Draenor. Some of the mounts that you have marked as favorites will walk around your Stables, allowing you to show them off.<br />
<br />
<br />
Level 1 - Enables the capture and training of special mounts on Draenor. Also allows you remain mounted while interacting with objects in outdoor Draenor zones.<br />
Level 2 - You will no longer get dazed by enemies while riding mounts in outdoor Draenor zones.<br />
Level 3 - Increases mount speed in Draenor by 20%.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Level 3 Unlock<br />
The Level 3 version of this building is unlocked by completing the Master of Mounts (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/9526-master-of-mounts) achievement, which requires you to unlock all six mounts that the Stables provides.<br />
<br />
<br />
Trained Mounts<br />
The Stables (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/67-stables) allow you to complete a series of quests to collect six different mounts. Initially you must capture a mount, which will open access to other quests that require you to train with it. After a sufficient amount of training (http://www.wowdb.com/quests?filter-search=Talbuk+Training) has been done, you are ready to learn the mount. These mounts will remain yours to use even if you replace the building with another. <br />

Blazing Wings and Shapeshift Forms<br />
There were some issues with certain cosmetic effects, such as Blazing Wings, attaching to shapeshift forms incorrectly (e.g. backwards, upside-down, etc). We had to disable them temporarily, but we've isolated the issues causing the bug, and should have it fixed for the next major patch. We think a feral Druid with fiery wings is going to look pretty sweet too.<br />
<br />
Longer-term, we're working on a way to allow cosmetic toys that completely take over your character (such as Smite's Brass Compass or Krastinov's Bag of Horrors) to work with shapeshift forms as well. I don't have details to share on exactly how that's going to work yet, but we're working on a solution that will allow everyone to enjoy their toys, without hurting gameplay for other players (such as being able to recognize when a Druid is in Cat form and thus unable to be Polymorphed).<br />

Any chance we could make it so friendly Earthquake doesn't show up or looks different? It's annoying as a melee.<br />
We'll likely hide Earthquake for allies of the caster (hotfix), and work on a chilled-out visual for a later patch. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/527588862692847616))<br />

BlizzCon 2014 Live Raid - Method vs. Midwinter<br />
The ongoing battle between two raiding behemoths continues! This year’s BlizzCon World of Warcraft Live Raid will once again pit Horde guild Method (EU-Twisting Nether) (http://www.methodwow.com/) against Alliance guild Midwinter (US-Sargeras) (http://www.mwguild.net/) in a battle for PvE supremacy. <br />
<br />
These two teams of exceptionally skilled raiders will be testing their mettle in the unreleased of Warlords of Draenor Raid dungeon Highmaul on Heroic difficulty. What could possibly go wrong?<br />
<br />
Each Raid team will have a trio of representatives on stage—and when the battle begins, they’ll need every ounce of your support wherever you’re watching BlizzCon from.<br />
<br />
Representing Midwinter on stage will be:<br />
<br />
Gondlem – Windwalker Monk<br />
Slootbag – Protection Paladin<br />
Kaowa – Assassination Rogue<br />
<br />
<br />
Representing Method on stage will be:<br />
<br />
Blatty – Arcane Mage<br />
Rogerbrown – Marksmanship Hunter<br />
Treckie – Protection Paladin<br />
<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft lead game designer Ion “Watcher” Hazzikostas will be joined on stage by community manager Josh “Lore” Allen to provide commentary on the Live Raid. <br />
<br />
If you’re attending BlizzCon 2014 in person, join us Saturday morning at 10 a.m. PST in Hall D to witness the epic battle—otherwise, you can tune in to watch the race live from the comfort of your home with the Virtual Ticket. <br />

It's not even that. They could just edit the Stormwind northwest model [Stormwind is divided into a few models] and add walls, or an overlook ledge that allows you to view the sea. Honestly, the Alliance lives in the shadow of the Cataclysm, while the Horde suffers no damages to their capital city after a SIEGE. No rubble, no consequences of a large scale battle taking place in and around one city.</div></div><hr />

It'll get done at some point. Untill then, Alliance players can enjoy an amazing looking Garrison with incredible details, amazing atmosphere and beautiful buildings. <br />

It's all about work allocation! <br />
The Alliance' park district is still in shambles because all availalbe laborforce was sent to create the new Garrisons.

<br />
Worgen and Goblins are getting updated, Robinson has said so. They have to as they use the old animation system and won't be able to use the many new animation FX future gear and armor will take advantage of. The question is really how much will be polished. <br />
<br />
Blood Elves are coming EARLY in WOD, it's been said over and over again. Worgen and Gobs are not a priority.<br />

This has been addressed a lot in the last year and it was never directly said at any time they were good enough, merely that they were not as in need of updating. But this has also been the stance for a long time. <br />

Sad but true. <br />
<br />
The Alliance have the best look Garrison, the Buildings are better, bigger, fuller. The ground work is beautiful, while the Horde has snow and dirt to walk on. The walls... yeah. <br />
<br />
The alliance got Karabor, while we also got Bladespire... and I think that's the also the reason they're no longer the capitals, seeing as Bladespire is one massive mudhut in the snow.<br />
<br />
<br />
Alliance players, mount up and fly around Orgrimmar and Stormwind, take a good long look at everything. Then tell me, would you rather have a fixed park, or live in a small city like the horde does?</div></div><hr />

Hilarious, right? It's the same reason Silvermoon isn't being rebuilt, but SW will have a chance not being an entire city. <br />
It's an issue of priorities. <br />
<br />
This is only important to most of you because you see a chance to point out some drama and controversy. They really should just put a mini Teldrassil growing from the ocean with the old park rebuilt in it's boughs and a bridge connecting it to Stormwind.</div></div><hr />

It's not as if there was any less effort put into the Horde buildings at all, it's an issue of nomadic architecture looking less interesting than classical fantasy castles. Teepees and mud huts, no matter how detailed and nuanced, are still just teepees and mud huts and yurts.<br />
There is plenty of individual touches to focus on in the Horde stuff if people would stop forcing the issue.<br />

<br />

<br />
Somewhat, but also the animated physics in the new armor and weapons where straps hang according to placement and things like belts and capes flapping in ways that are dynamic to spell casting and running, but most of all future plans we don't know about yet but have been told are being worked on, like adding real time dynamic physics to the game as well as more advanced geosets and animations in general. <br />
<br />
They will always have a degree of &quot;painted on&quot; stuff going on, but they also increase geosets with every expansion, belts and leggings in the last few and boots and gloves have started getting a lot of love, it used to just be shoulders and the original vanilla geosets. <br />
<br />
Robinson has hinted at revisiting the female worgen too in his Twitter. <br />
<br />
Of course, this is all mostly &quot;we want to&quot; stuff, but they do have to update the Worgen and Goblins for the upcoming updated stuff making use of the new rigging system.</div></div><hr />

Lorewise, the Horde and Orcs have been capable of large structures for more than 30 years. They've been past the Nomadic stage for some time. The art style isn't so much the issue, but the great effort in which the art team goes into making the Alliance bases and towns much more fuller and appealing than the Horde.<br />
<br />
This past holiday is a prime example. You go to Undercity, nothing up top, no decorations or nothing, just one singular large pumpkin(that stormwind has 20 of). You go into Undercity, and all you see is Orange fart smoke, with a pumpkin here and there. You go to Stormwind, every goddamn inch of Stormwind is covered in decorations and the city is massive. The one faction that you would think would be overly decorated from this holiday, has as much decoration as Brill.<br />
<br />
But this is not an &quot;issue&quot; that horde players bring up, that we want fixed. This is a counter to when Alliance say &quot;Muh park needs fixing cause my city that is 2x bigger than any other isn't perfect&quot; :P</div></div><hr />

Undercity is not a faction capital, go look at Orgrimar if you want useless pumpkins.<br />

<br />
They will always have a degree of &quot;painted on&quot; stuff going on, but they also increase geosets with every expansion, belts and leggings in the last few and boots and gloves have started getting a lot of love, it used to just be shoulders and the original vanilla geosets. <br />
<br />
Robinson has hinted at revisiting the female worgen too in his Twitter. <br />
<br />
Of course, this is all mostly &quot;we want to&quot; stuff, but they do have to update the Worgen and Goblins for the upcoming updated stuff making use of the new rigging system.<br />
<br />
Well that's good. I know chests and legs are less important, but need gloves and boots to have more 3d looks. One of my major turn offs from ESO was the huge amount of painted on armor. :/</div></div><hr />

Plus, it's not just repairing this part of the city, it's also offering something new, with an interesting visual (I would love a Gilnean artstyle with some NE assets added) and a lot of NPC. There is no need for a empty area with no shops, no inn or no profession buildings. If they rebuild the city, it need to be awesome, so I understand that they don't want to rush it. I don't think it's a priority because we will spend a lot of time on Draenor and we have no use of this space for now.<br />
<br />
And for people complaining about Orgrimmar having no side effect after the Siege, I think it's because of the Stormwind problem. Blizzard can't keep destroying things because they just don't have the time to rebuild them later. That's why a lot of places are still in pieces after the Cataclysm that was years ago. They just can't keep up with rebuilding everything. There is so much quests around places that are destroyed that it's not just having new buildings, it's relocating quests and NPCs. That's the main reason why Gilneas is still under Forsaken control. Blizzard just don't have the time to create a event for it to be liberated. Even with phasing it's complicated. They tried that with Theramore but it was the other way around. There is no plan to rebuild Theramore. If phasing was around since the beginning, we could have a world that really changes with our character levels, but that's not the case. Zones and cities are set for the level they are created for and don't change even is the lore is now different.</div></div><hr />

Yes. Would it take too much of their time to at least put up a construction fence alongside the damaged area to keep people from falling into the crater? Even Varian shouldn't be so distracted as to fail his people that way. Did any horde town or city get destroyed in Cata or MoP with the exception of Taurajo, a small village in The Barrens? Alliance has lost Theramore, the Park in SW, Auberdine, and Silverwind Refuge. So, yeah, we will complain about our Capital City not being repaired.</div></div><hr />

They said they wanted to add dungeons through content patches due to positive reception from players prior, but were iffy on implementing them because players outgear them quickly.

The problem with Silvermoon is that it is one of those cities like The Exodar that are not in a major questing hub area like Undercity, Ironforge, Stormwind, Darnassus, Orgrimmar and Thunderbluff.. So because Silvermoon / The Exodar are out of the way they see it as not needing updating, and mainly because there is not flying in those zones then there is no need to update it..<br />

They should have a team set up for the next expansion that updates all the cities imo.<br />
<br />
Also gonna love it when they end up claiming they have to scrap a raid and shit like they always do.</div></div><hr />

You do realize it was part of the Cataclysm revamp, right? They weren't going to half-ass one of the major selling points of Cataclysm.</div></div><hr />

A multimillonare company cannot repair few square meters of virtual world because of loaded schedule. Like it would take more than a few hours for a team from the interval of 2 years of an expansion. Players don't expect too much just to make it &quot;not ruins&quot;. Are they making this game with less than 10 ppl or what? They updated the character models with a 3 man team as far as I know. I was shocked. Why would only that few work on something like this big? And 18 models took them more than a year. Blizzard pls hire more employe, you have a ton of money...</div></div><hr />

They could just edit the Stormwind northwest model [Stormwind is divided into a few models] and add walls, or an overlook ledge that allows you to view the sea. Honestly, the Alliance lives in the shadow of the Cataclysm, while the Horde suffers no damages to their capital city after a SIEGE. No rubble, no consequences of a large scale battle taking place in and around one city.<br />
<br />
Other than the fact our city was completely revamped, Garrosh took a huge, wet, steamy, shit all over it and now we are stuck with it! I want old org back. You are complaining about a section of town no one even uses...</div></div><hr />

he's not going to do some menial amount of damage.<br />

Also, with all the wars and major threats that have been happening, I can see how it would slow down time<br />
for repairs when resources and man power would be put to better use fighting against these major threats.</div></div><hr />

I really love and hate Blizzard. They create great new content in other zones which I love. But they suck at keeping there existing world alive and moving forward with this new content. They should be doing much much more with WoW. Like adding AI, adding more voice overs on current and future NPC's. Adding new and better weather effects, adding a true &quot;night&quot; and &quot;day&quot; cycle and so on and so forth...</div></div><hr />

Orgrimmar needs to be remodeled at least 2 more times before Stormwind can be fixed.<br />

Agreed, even with the lingering damage to stormwind I still like it more, orgrimmar is such a confusing horrible mess I can never remember where anything is there ever.</div></div><hr />

Or they can hire a few more artists and devs for the amount of money we pay in subscriptions and expansion costs.</div></div><hr />

I've noticed this in the beta. I ran over/near some small bowls of blood while doing Altar Altercation (http://beta.wowdb.com/quests/34423-altar-altercation) and noticed that the bowls would flip over and spill out their contents.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Supposedly they were still supposed to be happening this expansion but they've already stated they haven't even started on them in a blue post just a few days ago.<br />
<br />
So, I imagine that will come in the final patch of the expansion at the earliest. Which is pretty terrible, but if we wind up getting an Azshara expansion following Warlords, I'm ready for the alleged &quot;year&quot; of Warlords to pass so we can just move on. <br />
<br />
Still would like to see updated model for blood elves, but they're going to look pretty much the same anyway so it's not like it's a huge deal.</div></div><hr />
