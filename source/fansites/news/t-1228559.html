There are now 6 guilds that have killed the first 3 bosses and only 16 that have killed the first. <br />

Happy Thanksgiving from the Community Team!<br />
The Community team will have a reduced presence on the forums while we are spending time with our loved ones for the Thanksgiving holiday. The forums will still be moderated while we are gone and it will be back to business as usual on Monday, November 26. We hope you enjoy your time in Azeroth and we look forward to talking about World of Warcraft with you all when we return.<br />

Misc<br />
What's an average Pandaren lifespan? Roughly humanlike? 100s? 200s?<br />
Roughly human... <br />
<br />
Any Plans to ever make secondary skills account wide? Leveling fishing on an Alt is horrible. <br />
Have you tried Cooking in MoP? It has a good catch up mechanism. We'd rather do catch ups than just never have to do it again. <br />
<br />
What Fishing Catch-Up? 3 dailies a day, each giving 1 fishing point isnt much of a &quot;catch-up&quot;. And book is 900g. <br />
There is no fishing catch up. My example was applying the cooking catch up to other professions. <br />
<br />
Are you guys going to (eventually) allow Blacksmiths to repair their own equipment or carry a portable anvil? <br />
The risk with repair costs is it's one of our largest gold sinks in the game. They might could be cheaper? <br />
<br />
How did you guys come up with The Klaxxi? <br />
The mantid are cool and we wanted them to have more depth and not feel like silithids. Also needed a good Dread Wastes hook. <br />
<br />
I just faction changed, and was sad to learn that we no longer get the equivalent of opposite-faction mounts. Why the change? <br />
Account level mounts had some side effects. We are working on a plan for how faction change should work with account-level stuff. <br />
<br />
Do you think that needing to be exalted with Klaxxi is a little steep for 363 weapons? Most will have better before then. <br />
Klaxxi weapons are intended primarily for transmog not as awesome weapons. <br />
<br />
Can you go into details about what we can spend the charms on? <br />
For now just bonus rolls. We might add to that, but we like that you can &quot;cap&quot; charms in a reasonable time so it's risky. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/261149465065451520))<br />
<br />
Are the developers talking about inventory space issues at the moment? Would love a Dev Watercooler on the subject. <br />
Our inventory system feels outdated. But, we don't want the solution to be that you just hoard every thing you ever find. <br />
<br />
Is there a design constraint on why Prospecting doesn't allow queuing like making bolts of cloth? <br />
Because the game doesn't know which minerals in your bag to consume. Would need a new UI.<br />
<br />
You guys always blame addons for player problems.. why don't you rule some of them out by programming them yourselves? <br />
We do if we think specific UI functionality is necessary enough to make it default. But we like allowing additional customization. <br />
<br />
I thought Daelo was the lead encounter designer? What happened? <br />
Scott Mercer (Daelo) is still with Blizzard, contributed a great deal to Mists, and currently working on other things.<br />

<br />
He spawns 1 - 3 times in reset and thats too quickly? Almost only change to get him is when server maintance is over and you log in right when servers come up again. After 5mins he is almost certainly dead and you won't see him in whole reset. Blizzard should shorten spawn timer!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you are overthinking how much effort they take (similar to challenge modes). Probably the amount of time it takes to make a scenario isn´t that much more than it would have taken to make the questline as a solo thing. Think of the Thrall questline where you had to go to the 4 realms to free him.. that probably would have been much cooler and more fun if it had been instanced and with a small group. The amount of effort to turn it into a ´dungeon´ was probably negligible.. and maybe actually easier because doing Thrall´s quests, the devs had to be prepared for when a lot of people were doing it together or when nobody but you was there.<br />
<br />
The fact that it is repeatable now is probably just icing on the cake... I would much rather have a controlled scenerio then a phased questline.</div></div><hr />

US guilds have nearly always had that time advantage, it's just more obvious on an instance with only 4 bosses.</div></div><hr />

100% to catch anything from fishing pools of any level, even at 1 fishing skill. I wish all gathering professions were like fishing. :P</div></div><hr />

We're talking about people with a set period of working hours and multiple projects. Blizzard doesn't hire people very often and keeps a relatively small dev team compared to the scale of the game they're working on.</div></div><hr />

Yea the WoW textures are definitely better and have finer detail, but the glow effects and flames in the UDK version are really awesome.

<br />
Yeah, this took about six months in my spare time. I do 3D modeling for a living so coming home and spending hours after work and weekends is tiring but it definitely paid off. Also, I had a pretty rudimentary knowledge of UDK so many of the effects I used I was learning about for the first time as I was creating it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc9103f45be9</div><div class="date">2012-11-23, 09:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol, the Effort it takes for new Art, isnt that why you Blizzard people take home the big dollars, quit your QQing and do more Art!<br />
The Blizzard artists can't just do art willy-nilly; they have to create artwork based on a given brief (designing a new zone, dungeon or race for example) and even before that, tonnes of concept art needs to be drafted up before they begin things like 3D modelling and that process can take some time (let alone the fact that creating artwork is time-consuming in and of itself).<br />
<br />
<br />
And im guessing he wasnt on Blizzard's payrole, so im sure it could of been done in lesser time if he had been paid.<br />
<br />
On his own? Working 8 hours a day? I'd imagine it'd still take him a few months.<br />
Fortunately for Blizzard, they have a team to utilise, however, said team is relatively small and they have to produce more stuff in what I'd imagine is a smaller time frame than six months.</div></div><hr />
