<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Creatinebrah</div><div class="date">2016-06-28, 10:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so many differences compared to MMOC vs wowhead. last few builds, wowhead had the correct changes.<br />
<br />
example on this one, Phoenix's Flames Hurls a Phoenix that causes (500%300% of Spell power) Fire damage to the target and splashes (150%100% of Spell power) Fire damage to other nearby enemies. This damage is always a critical strike.<br />
Cooldown changed from 1.5 min recharge to 45 sec recharge<br />
<br />
is most likely the correct one. not the one listed on this site</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not like our damage was even high in comparison to other classes anyway. Why do they keep nerfing hunters?<br />
<br />
I hope the pvp templates which don't get shown are at least altered in a way that makes MM less useless in pvp. We have no survivability anymore but as it stands we can't deal any damage either.</div></div><hr />

Yea but lots of nerfs overall so still lower dmg than with the last build.</div></div><hr />

The whole way they've handled hunters in Legion beta has me triggered.</div></div><hr />

What nerfs? Only buffs this build. Mutilate, Garrotte and Envenom got buffed.</div></div><hr />

This is so dumb. I'd rather have it for 1500% spell power damage and a 1.5 min cd rather than a sh*t damage low cd. It's just a longer cool down fire blast now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Read the talent changes too. From the looks of it they nerfed the straight % damage increase talents like Elaborate planning which curbs the OP burst on the beta right now but to balance they bumped up base line a bit. Curbs the burst but balances by making more steady damage. At least that's what I deduced.</div></div><hr />

Huh.</div></div><hr />

But no worry , we all have shitload of lvl 100's by now .<br />
Pick a heavy hitting ranged pure class and delete that paladin , just do that and life(dps) will be alot simpler in wow .<br />
Soon raids will be &quot;rangedheavy&quot; ?? Meaning bosses be insta kills . :rolleyes:<br />
Going ret with that guy in the driver seat is a big NONO !!</div></div><hr />

<br />
When it is not in live you can't call it nerfs and buffs.<br />
What they are doing is ajusting the numbers.<br />
<br />
Apparantly the numbers the Ret Paladin testers were doing were too high, so they ajusted that... Not hard to understand.</div></div><hr />

I read it and guess what pvp set will you be wearing during pre-patch?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The same as everyone else.<br />
<br />
It's not going to matter anyway. Rated pvp will stop until a week after xpac drops. You'll just have bgs. Then it won't even matter a few weeks later.</div></div><hr />
