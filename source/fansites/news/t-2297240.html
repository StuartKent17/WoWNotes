Argussian Reach Emissary Hotfix<br />
Noticed this myself as well - I've been actively doing every World Quest across Argus every day, and only have two Argrussian World Quests up now (one normal + one pet battle). I've sent an ask about this over to the development team, so I'll let you know when I hear something official.<br />
<br />
I've also asked for clarification on the intent/rule behind &quot;should there always be enough world quests up to immediately complete a new Emissary&quot;.<br />
<br />
Edit: In the mean time, be patient, as I'm sure more will spawn through the day.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your patience everyone - a hotfix is live as of about 15 minutes ago to require the Argussian Reach Emissary Quest to only require three World Quests to complete. There's currently an issue where the text will show as four needed, but it should complete at three.<br />
<br />
This is being done temporarily, until next week, at which more Argussian Reach World Quests should be available and the Emissary Quest requirement for this faction will be reverted back to require four.<br />
<br />
Even at three there are not enough up. <br />
I'm seeing two on Mac'Aree and one in Krokuun currently, as of this writing.<br />
<br />
Another issue is that some rare boss World Quests intentionally count for both Army of Light and Argussian Reach, but may only show one or the other at the moment, as the UI doesn't seem to want to support showing both. This is something we're looking into, but in the mean time I suggest trying some of the Army of Light rares and seeing if they count.<br />
<br />
It's not intended that you would need to Pet Battle or turn in crafting materials to complete this Emissary.<br />

<br />
5mins of game play and 10mins of talking about the match is enough to turn people away.</div></div><hr />

WoW just isn't fun to watch another person play.<br />
<br />
<br />
With a good dozen or so skills at a player's command, and even more thrown into the mix with talent trees, knowing what you're looking at in a PvP situation can be difficult to follow even for someone who plays WoW, let alone a casual person just watching. And what you're looking at is usually a colossal jumble of numbers flying up into the air. <br />
<br />
<br />
Compare that to games like HoTs or LoL or Overwatch... characters have maybe five abilities, the progression at which things happen in a match is fairly clear, and the abilities are clearly communicated visually. It's easy to communicate skill in games that have things like skillshots; much less so in something like WoW where things are (generally) auto-targeted and a lot of what happens happens in the form of dots and cooldown management. Fun to participate in, but not fun to watch. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If Blizzard wants to push WoW as an Esport, I'd recommend they take the focus off of arena and push it into battlegrounds, where the objectives are much more evident and the average person can follow the progression of action much more thoroughly. Hell, I'd say taking it to battlegrounds like Wintergrasp where you have massive numbers of people fighting would probably be the most fun to watch.</div></div><hr />
