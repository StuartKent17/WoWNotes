This Week in WoW History<br />
We're taking a look back at old MMO-Champion posts and World of Warcraft news that occurred during this time in previous years.<br />
<br />
Winged Guardian<br />
One of the later 4.1 PTR builds added a Winged Lion mount model. This was a new and unique model, but not much else was known about it. About a week later, Blizzard announced that this would be a Store mount, called the Winged Guardian. Like all store mounts, once purchased it was usable on any character above level 20 and it scaled to the flying speed your character had learned.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Hearthsteed<br />
This promotional mount was added as an incentive for players to download and play Blizzard’s newest game, Hearthstone. After winning three matches, the mount was automatically applied to the account. Later, a red model was found, initially believed that would be the Horde version, but the model never got used in game.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Songs of Azeroth - The Final Act<br />
Mentioned in previous posts, AFK PL@AYERS made a series of WoW music videos to celebrate the 10th Anniversary of Taiwan WoW. In this final act, they celebrate all the past villains of the Warcraft universe, because without villains there are no heroes. <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Frost Mage Animations<br />
In the first round of animation update mages saw new spell effects for Ray of Frost, Glacial Spike, Ebonbolt, Frozen Touch, Icy Veins with Chilled to the Core, Ice Form, and temporal Shield. Some of these were new abilities introduced in Legion, but mages got a later spell update during patch 7.2 to most of their toolkit.<br />

<br />
<br />
Blizzard Voice<br />
Early on in WoW an attempt was made to make it easier for players to talk in game without having to use third party programs. The initial version of the in-game chat didn’t turn out as they wanted, so this second iteration of Blizzard Voice is integrated into the Blizzard Launcher, rather than the game. This would allow players to use the chat system even when they are not playing games. Many features were promised, which players were used to from other apps.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Warcraft TV Spot 2<br />
With the Warcraft movie approaching, TV spots started airing in the U.S. and online. This second version showed a few new scenes that we haven’t seen before to generate hype for the new movie. The sword and shield from the first scene were also later added as transmog items for the promotional event of the movie.<br />

<br />
Chris Metzen Statue<br />
Shortly after the news that Chris Metzen would be leaving Blizzard, pictures of his statue at the Blizzard Headquarters were shared online. A one hour interview is also available, where he talks about his time at the company, and shares some insight. For those who might not who he is, Chris Metzen started working at Blizzard in 1993 when it was still known as Chaos Studios. He was a game designer, artist, author, and voice actor for many of our favorite titles to be released by Blizzard.<br />

FinalBossTV 1st Impressions of Paladins in Battle for Azeroth<br />
FinalBossTV (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh8jtU3reaHOJ4aqbGxgNrQ) made a few videos recently on his first impressions for Paladins in Battle for Azeroth!<br />

<br />
This of course is only counting people prestige 1+. Those first three levels are EASILY gotten just casually doing warden towers. Nor does this take into account multiple characters on one account. 78% are prestige 3 and down. <br />
<br />
That means 488k are actively PvPing. These PvPers are also the most likely to have alts of high prestige. <br />
<br />
Please someone try to argue that Legion didnt kill PvP.<br />

<br />
its a cumulative graph - the 21.64% of characters who have the prestige 2 achievement are also included in the 44.39% of people who have the prestige 1 achievement - if you try to total all the bars together, you are repeatedly double-counting characters<br />
<br />
<br />
This is only looking at people who have achieved at least prestige rank 1.<br />
nope - 44% of the 2.3 million active characters in EU/NA have the prestige 1 achievement, 22% of the 2.3 million active characters included have the prestige 1 + 2 achievements, 13% of the 2.3 million active characters have the prestige 1 + 2 + 3 achievements, etc</div></div><hr />

<br />
123.74% of people have a prestige rank. These numbers are quite suspect.<br />
<br />
It's because everyone that have prestige 2 obviously also has prestige 1. They are not supposed to total up to 100% - what it does mean is that 44.39% of the characters has at least prestige 1.</div></div><hr />

Wait, what? Since when? Was this the original intent? Winged Guardian is currently not a passenger mount.<br />

Just to put some perspective, I usually do all Warden Towers (as time allows), a few random BGs here and there, the weekly Brawl, and I did 1 RBG a day (unless it was a great group), and almost no arena. <br />
Even though it is a grind, and I won't argue against that, it still has rewards I enjoy: gold/mounts/titles/xmog/AP. <br />
I've never found it as bad as other people do, and I feel like people who say Legion killed PVP are mostly people who never had an interest in it to begin with.</div></div><hr />

I've always did PvP in my free time. I'm mostly PvE guy, but after I did raids, I had nothing else to do to improve my character, so I spent that time getting some fun in the game: leveling alts, PvP. Now I can't allow myself to get fun in this game, including PvP.<br />
<br />
That said, I spent some time doing battlegrounds and arenas. I must admit that they did a good work. It's the best PvP I've ever had in WoW. It's a pity I can't allow myself more time for PvP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ummmm, yeah, no. There's only two mounts that turn you into the actual mount (discounting Travel form glyph and Tarecgosa staff), and most especially one that lets another player ride, and that's Obsidian Nightwing and Sandstone Drake. And Nightwing is an RAF mount, not a Store mount. As much as I loved Winged Guardian, I'm decently sure that was never really a feature, even during datamining.<br />
<br />

The pvp double honor weeks are probably the only time it actually feels reasonable worth doing pvp, with the quest reward and all. <br />

Also marks of honor and gear being rng, and heavily biased on whether you win or not.... yeah I'm not going to lose my way to a set of gear while literally every other person on forums goes &quot;I got mine in a day, you're lying/overreacting/bad!&quot;</div></div><hr />

There are two options: one, you are a normal player = you get almost nothing or PVP is your life and you are above 2.4k on rbgs and arenas and maybe you will get some good looking shit... <br />
99% will never reach this 2.4k anyway. SO what chance do you have to get anything from PVP?<br />
GG Blizzard the Overwatch system is far more better.</div></div><hr />

Its basically the same as honorable kills, showing nothing but amount of time invested, yet honorable kills are account wide. With allied races offering new exciting race/class combinations many will reroll (or have rerolled with pre-order), now because its not account-wide they have to grind Prestige from 0.</div></div><hr />

Even though it is a grind, and I won't argue against that, it still has rewards I enjoy: gold/mounts/titles/xmog/AP. <br />
<br />
The biggest problem with it is that it's character-based. If you want X reward, you pick one character and grind that one exclusively. I leveled my DH a bit to get one of the PvP weapon appearances and did a little more with the auto-complete on ones that gave resources/transmog tokens. Then I hit prestige and got a duplicate mount. After a duplicate pet.<br />
<br />
If the rewards were tokens that you could pick one, it would be a lot better. You still get mounts every, say, 4 prestige, but it also then lets you play a different character if you want, instead of say getting to prestige 12, deciding you want to play your paladin and then have to grind to prestige 16 for the next mount, getting duplicates of all the other rewards along the way.<br />
<br />
<br />
(The numbers are incorrect and just thrown in as examples to make the point)</div></div><hr />

They should make them account bound really. It doesn't make sense to have them character bound. It's not an arena rating.......<br />

I agree, I liked pvp in Legion. The system does need some tweeks and polish though, but I think it is a good base to start with. I think the brawls were a good addition.</div></div><hr />

You can only do towers and 3/4 of the rotating PvP WQ's each season and hit the cap before the next season comes out if you do them everyday.<br />
<br />
This entire PvP system is set up to where you could have just PvE'd your way to cap and never gotten a single HK.</div></div><hr />

I think it's all about community. PVE community is no perfect, you meet some troll from time to time, but it's really rare. And if you play with guild you won't find any toxicity at all.

I wouldn't say legion killed PvP but it sure as hell didn't do anything to increase its participation %. I think removing the grind to collect pvp gear sets really killed it for a lot of players. Like i did a bunch of pvp last week and got 4 chestpieces in a row.. which is absolutely retarded. I feel like players enjoyed doing pvp to work towards those sets. The way prestige systems worked to unlock the skins was kind of dumb. After i unlocked the first appearance there was no fuckin way i was grinding to unlock the other colors.</div></div><hr />

seething shore gave some hope on how they understand how to approach an objective can be interesting in terms of strategy but beyond that its the same crap once you are on the ground. <br />
<br />
i dont think the game engine really holds much in the future in ways of creating interesting or new ways to PVP. the only consistency is that pvp has gotten worse every season since around season 8.</div></div><hr />

Pvp rewards are stupid but pvp gameplay is better then ever Before i never liked idea of pvp gear... Somebody kill just because im in pve that is bullshit now when There is no specific pvp gear nobody even touch in bg when im playing my balance<br />

And now you need to do PvE content to do good in pvp. You should get heroic+ raiding gear to do good in pvp. Makes sense.</div></div><hr />

But out of which many got their prestige from tower quest and rarely stepped into a bg/arena. <br />
<br />
Therefore my guess would be somewhere around 4-500k top, players who got involved in some form of pvp, and that's a global figure.<br />
Now compare it with WOTLK to realise the magnitude of the drop.<br />

But because I take breaks now and then I'm still only prestige 13 or 14. To get prestige 25+ before next expansion I basically need to live in bgs 24/7.</div></div><hr />
