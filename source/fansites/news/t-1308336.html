Battle.net Launcher Update: Testers Wanted<br />
We're continuing the Battle.net®-related testing we mentioned previously (http://us.battle.net/d3/en/blog/7924401). As part of this, we're now inviting beta testers to help test and refine a new desktop app for Battle.net designed to improve the launcher experience for all Blizzard games and streamline the ability for players to get into their games.<br />
<br />
If you’d like to help us with the testing, head to your Battle.net Beta Profile (https://us.battle.net/account/management/beta-profile.html) and opt in to at least one of the game universe beta tests (if you haven’t done so already). We’ll be inviting players to the beta test in waves—if you’re selected, your Battle.net account will be flagged automatically and you’ll receive an email with additional details.<br />
<br />
For more information, check out the FAQ (https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/battlenet-desktop-app-faq) or visit the beta test forums (http://us.battle.net/en/forum/).<br />
<br />
<br />
Launcher Update Testing FAQ<br />
When does the beta test begin? How do I opt-in?<br />
The beta test is now underway. If you’d like a chance to participate, first make sure you’ve created a BattleTag, and then head to your Beta Profile Settings and opt in to any of the Warcraft, StarCraft, or Diablo beta tests. See the Beta Opt-In Instructions for a helpful walkthrough. If you have already opted in for a previous Blizzard beta, you don’t need to opt in a second time.<br />
<br />
What platforms and languages are supported?<br />
The Battle.net desktop application is available for Windows and Mac in English, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Russian, Polish, traditional Chinese, and Korean.<br />
<br />
What regions can participate?<br />
Players in the Americas and Oceania, Europe, Korea, and Taiwan can participate. Players in mainland China will not be able to participate in this beta test. We’ll have more information to share about our plans for the Battle.net desktop app in mainland China in the future.<br />
<br />
Is there a non-disclosure agreement?<br />
There is not a nondisclosure agreement for this beta test. Those invited to play are free to take screenshots and discuss the app. Participants can give us feedback in the beta test forums.<br />
<br />
How does game patching work through the Battle.net desktop app?<br />
When you’re logged in to the Battle.net desktop app, it automatically downloads and installs updates for all supported games as they become available. You can patch one game at a time; the Battle.net desktop app also allows you to pause the patching process for one game in order to patch another, if needed.<br />
<br />
Which Blizzard games are supported in the Battle.net desktop app?<br />
The Battle.net desktop app allows you to launch Diablo III, StarCraft II, and World of Warcraft. Classic Blizzard games such as Diablo II, StarCraft, and Warcraft III are not currently supported, though we’re looking into the possibility of adding support for these games in the future.<br />
<br />
I want to use the game-specific launcher for one of my games. How do I do that?<br />
During the beta, you can switch to the previous launcher by uninstalling the Battle.net desktop app. As long as the Battle.net desktop app is installed on your system, you will not be able to access World of Warcraft, StarCraft II, or Diablo III through their standard launchers.<br />
<br />
Can I log in to the Battle.net desktop app on multiple computers?<br />
Yes, although the original login will expire if your account is logged in from another computer.<br />
<br />
Can I still access the Battle.net website in my browser?<br />
Yes, the Battle.net website will stay the same. The Battle.net desktop app provides a quick, convenient way to access your Blizzard games and certain features of Battle.net account management without opening a web browser.<br />
<br />
Will everyone’s launchers eventually be updated to the Battle.net desktop app?<br />
Yes — in the future, every Blizzard gamer will need to use the Battle.net desktop app to play their favorite Blizzard games. The Battle.net desktop app will replace the individual game launchers for World of Warcraft, StarCraft II, and Diablo III, and will act as your gateway to accessing future Blizzard games.<br />
<br />
We’ll let players know in advance when we plan to roll the app out to everyone.<br />
<br />
I'm having an issue—how can I get help?<br />
Check the Known Issues List or visit the Battle.net desktop app beta forums to see if your issue is mentioned there. During the beta test, if you’re unable to resolve the issue and it’s preventing you from accessing your games, you can uninstall the beta client at any time to go back to using a game’s standard launcher.</div></div><hr />

As a WoW player who already pays that fee i wouldn't mind that move AT ALL.<br />
<br />
I imagine that SC2 players who don't own WoW and therefore don't pay any monthly fee would fire up their torches and polish their pitchforks...<br />

As long as companies don't start suing eachother for every single damned thing, using what has been proved to work and apply it to your products is a great thing.<br />

Instalogin? Im ok with this.<br />
Well after you have already logged in and set the launcher to remember you. If you end up sharing your computer with others then you still have to log in each time you use the launcher, especially if you dont want someone else to use your account. Blizzard could of had its games remember your account and password but choose not to for security reasons. It is just more convenient when swapping between Blizzard games and hopefully remove that frantic relogging in after a DC.</div></div><hr />

If you have a battle.net with multiple wow accounts, you will still be able to multibox.<br />
If player A is on computer A on the battle.net client's WoW#1, but player B signs on computer B, and signs on WoW#2, Player A will be kicked out of the client, but will not be kicked out of WoW.</div></div><hr />

It's just the original Launcher with extra optional options. It's your choice if you want to let it leech your 'resources' (though if you are playing WoW on any computer, you'll probably have 1kb resources to spare)</div></div><hr />

Same here. Tired of being unable to even look left or right without something being force &quot;upgraded&quot;. I sure as heck didn't view b.net as an improvement back in 2009, and I bloody well don't want this desktop client.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you may every now and then have to update the client for bug fixes, but they're like.. 2 second updates. the upgrades are minimal, and the restart takes about 10 seconds without having to download anything (youll just get a message saying you need to restart, wait 10 seconds, youre back.)<br />
<br />
dont be a grumpy butt. &quot;eh, is this new? I have to update it every now and then!? I DONT LIKE IT!&quot;<br />
<br />
And you will have the option to keep your games upgraded automatically or not, if that makes you feel better. I dont have diablo 3 installed, but if i did, it would an option here as well.<br />

<br />
Resource use is minimal. As for spying on you, any time you run a Blizzard game (sc2, d3, wow), there's a program already scanning your ram for any unauthorized programs (cheats/bots).<br />

I understand being wary but give it a chance first. Really it's just like the launcher, except it is one launcher for all the games. And it has a chat app built in. It's pretty streamlined, not bloated or resource hoggy (right now), and it's kinda nice to just have to log into the app and be able to single-click launch the game any time you want. It really feels like the way it should have been done from the start.<br />
<br />
The upgrade to Battle.net was a necessary evil but it was pretty clusterfucky. It was also a whole new system and the process did not go smoothly. This is really similar to how we already do things but more convenient and more features and, despite being early beta, it doesn't seem buggy at all. (that said, chat is disabled so we'll see)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It works really great. Before you launch the game you can choose which license and region. Then I am right in my game as it opens without having to enter my password more than the first time I opened the app.<br />

Yes — in the future, every Blizzard gamer will need to use the Battle.net desktop app to play their favorite Blizzard games. The Battle.net desktop app will replace the individual game launchers for World of Warcraft, StarCraft II, and Diablo III, and will act as your gateway to accessing future Blizzard games.<br />
<br />
We’ll let players know in advance when we plan to roll the app out to everyone.<br />
<br />
This displeases me.<br />
<br />
Even if you only play one game, it works better than the basic WoW/D3/SC2 Launcher. Its a new and improved one and involves all Battle.net games.</div></div><hr />

It's your choice if you want to let it leech your 'resources' (though if you are playing WoW on any computer, you'll probably have 1kb resources to spare)<br />
<br />
It starts at 1kb but won't stay that way. The problem isn't battle.net desktop client, origin, steam or uplay. It's a combination of all of them that all want to run at start up and track everything i do and sell me games (at least steam provides them at a good price, the others don't/won't).<br />

It's just extra rubbish that has to run on your computer eating up resources doing nothing and providing mostly just annoyance. Besides, it's just another way of forcing people into always-on DRM.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has made starting with Windows an opt-in checkbox instead of opt-out, as Tziva mentioned above.<br />
<br />
Unless you specifically go into options and check the checkbox, this program will not start up with your computer, and will only start up when you click on WoW/D3/SC2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
what im trying to say is make it optional to use those who want to use it they do it those who dont want to use just dont use easy as that why do they have to beta test it anyway. next time they beta test the download process and then the loading process of the game of course only with ppl who got selected <br />

It's only opening one instance of the desktop app by default, this can be changed via the menu.<br />
you can not log into one battle-net account on both apps at the same time, one will drop out.<br />
Closing the app in the background does not shut down your clients.</div></div><hr />

It works really great. Before you launch the game you can choose which license and region. Then I am right in my game as it opens without having to enter my password more than the first time I opened the app.<br />

<br />
I see no reason why you shouldn't, guessing you will just have to disable auto login so one account doesn't get automatically disconnected when you re-launch the app.<br />
<br />
Don't have two B-Net accounts personally so I can't verify, but I'm fairly sure it's possible based on what I've seen so far.<br />
<br />
I'm dissapointed it doesn't include Diablo 2 and other older games, but I'll just make a complaint ;) that's what beta testing is for I guess.</div></div><hr />

I haven't tried (I'll try tonight - I have two licenses) but I think you can as long as they're different wow accounts under the same battle.net. If it doesn't work yet, it should eventually or I imagine there would be a huge uproar from multiboxers.<br />
<br />
I don't know about separate battle.net accounts; that might be sketchier since it would mean you would need two desktop apps. I can see that maybe being problematic although that's sort of an unconventional way to do things, so it wouldn't surprise me if it wasn't supported. <br />
<br />
The solution would just be to put all your licenses under the same battle.net and solve the issue. I'm not sure why people sometimes separate them out anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
Can you still run your games without this crap???<br />
Yes, if you don't want to use the launcher, you can go into your WoW game folder and run the .exe, same as now. The launcher is mainly for patching and displaying news and stuff.<br />
<br />
You can also use the desktop client as a launcher and then close it from your system tray once the game is opened, although it doesn't take much resources so I'm not sure that leaving it in the system tray would matter much. <br />
<br />
<br />
How do you even &quot;test&quot; a desktop client?<br />
By using it!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alayea</div><div class="date">2013-06-11, 08:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you may every now and then have to update the client for bug fixes, but they're like.. 2 second updates. the upgrades are minimal, and the restart takes about 10 seconds without having to download anything (youll just get a message saying you need to restart, wait 10 seconds, youre back.)<br />
<br />
dont be a grumpy butt. &quot;eh, is this new? I have to update it every now and then!? I DONT LIKE IT!&quot;<br />
<br />
And you will have the option to keep your games upgraded automatically or not, if that makes you feel better. I dont have diablo 3 installed, but if i did, it would an option here as well.<br />
<br />

I'm no curmudgeon. There are some upgrades that I do like, like say a new graphics card - it's great. There are also upgrades which I feel are not so, but get no choice in the matter. Check out the latest YouTube channel layout - it's terrible.<br />
<br />
Also, &quot;upgrade&quot; and &quot;update&quot; are not always the same thing. ;)</div></div><hr />

You can launch the app multiple times, it's off by default but you can enable it via settings.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
You can launch multiple clients straight from the app, you even get a dropup menu to select which account you wish to launch similar to the old logon in the game itself. <br />
The app is still active in the background after you open the game, tabbing back is not an issue.<br />
Besides, if you can still launch games without the app multiboxers would have nothing to uproar against regardless. :)<br />
<br />
I'm sure many of them are using scripts to launch all their clients anyways.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I knew about the dropdown, mainly because it's defaulting to my second account every time and I accidentally log into the wrong account every time. But I hadn't actually tried it to see if swapping and hitting 'play' again would just log out the current one and log it in to the other license, or if it actually launched a second client.<br />
<br />
(fwiw, Grindfreak is right - I just tested; it launches a second client for your second wow license)</div></div><hr />

As to booting with the OS, there's always a way to stop those programmes from doing that, Bnet's Client won't be any different.<br />
<br />
I don't know in what world you live, but having 4 front-ends (Steam, Origin, U-Play and now Battle.net) is a good thing. That is 4 programs that are running in the background, regardless of how much memory or CPU time they consume, it's still 4 programs which shouldn't be there from the get go like it was in the past and it worked flawlessly. <br />
<br />
I can deal with Steam potentially since it's really become the biggest game store on the internet, but to have every publisher and smart pants guy bring out their own front-ends it's not better for the consumer it is in-fact worse. <br />
<br />
And before you start, if I disable all those launcher/front-ends to launch with Windows, I have to wait about 15-30 seconds when I want to play a game before those exact same launchers actually launch, authenticate and run the game, something that would take me exactly 1 second on this machine if the games wouldn't be DRMd to hell and would just allow me to click twice on the .exe file. <br />
<br />
Aside of that every battle.net enabled game already requires authentication when you want to play, so there is no reason for this what-so-ever for a DRMed front-end.<br />
<br />
I'm kind of curious what happens with the final product and I try to launch WoW.exe, if it start opening the Battle.net thing, I will face palm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This paragraph is a wee bit contradictory isn't it?<br />
<br />
As to what world i live in, i live in a world where i want my computer to boot as fast as possible, so i don't want every single brand environment and game hub to launch at once. Currently, apart from all the important software i only have Steam to open with Windows, as there's no need for the rest. And i believe there's plenty of people who share my views on this. <br />
<br />
I can always launch Bnet, Origin or whatever when i need it, right?<br />
<br />
<br />
And before you start, if I disable all those launcher/front-ends to launch with Windows, I have to wait about 15-30 seconds when I want to play a game before those exact same launchers actually launch, authenticate and run the game, something that would take me exactly 1 second on this machine if the games wouldn't be DRMd to hell and would just allow me to click twice on the .exe file. <br />
<br />
Those apps don't just launch instataneous out of thin air. Those seconds you &quot;gain&quot; when you want to play a game are seconds used up at the OS boot to prepare the apps. I prefer my computer to boot faster than having my games open instantly, by a long margin.<br />
<br />
<br />
I can deal with Steam potentially since it's really become the biggest game store on the internet, but to have every publisher and smart pants guy bring out their own front-ends it's not better for the consumer it is in-fact worse. <br />
<br />
Once again i'm confused as to wether or not you like having those steam-like apps or not...</div></div><hr />
