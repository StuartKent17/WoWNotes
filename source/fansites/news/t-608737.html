6. Players must use their registered MLG Login Name during all Games. No Team Name abbreviations are allowed.<br />
7. No Warm-Up Games may be played outside of scheduled Warm-Up periods.<br />
8. During scheduled Warm-Up periods the winners can stay, but the losers must get up.<br />
9. During scheduled Warm-Up periods, Teams still active in the Event have priority over open Stations.<br />
10. In the case of a Computer/Monitor malfunction or a Character falling below the Map, the Game will be restarted from the beginning unless one Team had 2 more living Characters than the opposing Team.<br />
11. Games started without the approval of a referee will be restarted.<br />
12. If a Team fails to report to their Station within 5 minutes of the announcement, they will Forfeit the 1st Game. 10 minutes after the announcement, a Team will Forfeit the 2nd Game. 15 minutes after the announcement, a Team will Forfeit their Best of 5 Game Match.<br />
<br />
Equipment<br />
1. Players may bring their own mouse, keyboard, headphones, and mouse pad.<br />

<br />
Championship Bracket<br />
1. The Championship Bracket is a Best of 5 Game Match, Double Elimination Bracket.<br />
2. After losing a Match, Teams will fall into the Losers Bracket.<br />
3. A Match loss in the Losers Bracket will result in elimination from the Event.<br />
4. Teams may consist of 3 or 4 Players.<br />
5. Teams must submit their Roster of Players/Characters to the Referee prior to the start of Games 1, 3, and 5.<br />
6. Before Games 3 and 5, Teams will be given 5 minutes to change Players, Characters, Settings, redistribute Talent Points.<br />
7. Teams will be seeded randomly.<br />
8. All Gear will be standard Season 2 Arena Gear.<br />

11. No Game Type may be played more that two times in a Best of 5 Game Match.<br />
12. No Game Type may be played more than four times in a Best of 11 Game Match.<br />
13. If Teams meet for a 2nd time in the Championship Bracket, their Match will expand to a Best of 11, include the previous Match, and pick up where that Match left off. For example, if Team A beat Team B 3 Games to 0 in the Winners Bracket, the Best of 11 will resume with Game 4 and Team A leading 3 Games to 0. Before Games 7, 9, and 11, Teams will be given 5 minutes to change Players, Characters, Settings, and redistribute Talent Points.<br />
14. If the Teams meeting in the Finals have not yet faced each other in the Championship Bracket and the Team coming from the Losers Bracket wins a Match, another Match must be played to break the tie since both Teams would only have one Match loss.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it's a big difference, because MELEES are the most overpowered thing in wow right now and you mentioned a warlock would have one this tournament... well actually a warlock won this tournament, BUT he had to reroll a Warrior in order to be successfull ;-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
RRD counters RMP so no big shock there.<br />
<br />
Nihilium fucked up when the hunter tried going BM...giving up improved drain/wingclip/entrapment in a double healer drain team = bad idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep, and they acely did well in that round. So saying that melee is overpowerd isent excatly 100% right, but with S4 it seems like they are gonna be. Lets see if blizzard even cares about this, thair minds is on wotlk.<br />
<br />
On topic, nice final, did see TV from start to end, where some vry nice wars, and some damn long wars, and alot of retard'ed wars, but all over all, a nice turnament, and well done with those blizz servers and spectate.<br />
Shame niellum dident play that well overall, a EU win whould have been nice ;)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mazorp</div><div class="date">2008-06-16, 01:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This was done with Season 2 gear just like the tournament realms. That means melee are not as powerful as they currently are. Armor penetration is what has made melee teams so incredibly powerful right now as the damage has scaled much higher than survivability of cloth users. If this would have been a Season 3 armor tournament it wouldn't have been nearly as interesting and every make up would have been some form of double melee.<br />
<br />
I really think Nihilum fell apart as they are the superior team from what I saw. More tournament experience on the half of Frag Dominant really helped with the meta game of respecing and different classes. I was very happy to see a relatively unique combo being played by Nihilum, in the end though it hurt them as they let Spoh often get off Innervate and drink.<br />
<br />
Azael or Hydra were the MVPs. Hydra's play as Priest was incredible, while that might be a popular Euro style of play you don't see it to often in the US battlegrounds. Of course once FD came to understand they really started playing around it well. Azael playing two classes and doing so extremely well was also incredible. Tie, maybe the slight edge to Azael for being the winner.<br />
<br />
Awesome tournament because the announcers were very good for this type of coverage and actually had a clue about WoW and arena. The interaction with the thread and IRC also was a nice touch and acknowledging when wrong was also a very good thing. I still don't agree with the tournament rules 100% (add ons are a key to WoW and one of the most discussed aspects of the game by far, and could be easily checked to be within Blizzard desired limits before match play starts).</div></div><hr />

What? Is this sarcastic? Cause, there was only one euro team (which is one of the only ones sticking to their starting comp) and they made it to the finals, idiot.<br />
Also it's not cherez fault if he died, he did kite really well, but rather priest/druid not careful enough on some rng burst, going too far from their hunt cost them some rounds.</div></div><hr />

I'm shut :), I still laugh at WoW being played competitively though. The sheer randomness factor of this game makes it laughable, but as long as people enjoy it and the crowd likes it, I'm fine with it, still I laugh deep inside :).</div></div><hr />

Either you didnt watch the fights at all, or you dont understand half of what Cherez did.<br />
<br />
Single dps class on their setup dies with both his healers at 50%~ mana, and you claim it to be Cherez' fault ? <br />
<br />
Nihilum lost mostly due to lucky RNG, and/or careless play by his healers, atleast not by Cherez' performance. <br />
<br />
Both the 4-5, and 4-6 matches was so close (mostly it seemed nihilum would take it), and could easily gone the other way.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mazorp</div><div class="date">2008-06-16, 04:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a reason you play multiple rounds per &quot;match.&quot; Over time all RNG balances itself out and its random so the chance for both sides are the same. If it was only one match people might have a point but it's not. Luck will always be involved with any kind of competition. In &quot;real&quot; sports it belongs to the referees who everyone knows all to often make a bad call in the heat of the moment or even just the weather. I can't think of a single game that does not have some aspect of luck in it though.<br />
<br />
I like watching these matches live and without being edited. It's not a highlight reel this way. A lot of times players hurt themselves with videos because they show nothing but perfection and no one is perfect. Tons of mistakes were made and hindsight is always right but when you have milliseconds to decide on your next move you're sometimes going to take the wrong one.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">callidas</div><div class="date">2008-06-16, 09:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The last two games were simply awesome! Nihilum managed to get the drain on big style, and FD were 100% out of mana, it was a matter of 30 seconds of pressure and the win was guaranteed both times. I couldn't tell if it was a saving up of combo points/rage and a well timed Expose Armor / rage dump that managed to burst down Cherez, or just the 'try line fumble' that can occur when you are seconds away from a win (or even RNG) but both games FD seemed to snatch victory by nuking down Cherez seconds before they were doomed to loose. Very exciting stuff.<br />
<br />
There was no doubting the pressure that the aggressive drain comp put out, especially on the opposition healers - the number of druids stuck in bear form as a shift would activate the viper sting they had sitting on them, and the sheer amount of dispel / mana drain / holy fire and smites that Hydra put out was immense. The first few rounds were a cakewalk for the Europeans as the Americans had not seen anything like it, but controlled play and adaptability enabled FD to keep in the game long enough to enable the bursts on hunter to seal the match. <br />
<br />
With a little more lan experience (no addons must suck hard for their comp) I can see Nihilum carrying the flag for 'Europe' for a long time to come :)<br />
<br />
All in all a great tournament and well worth staying up till 5AM to watch the whole coverage (all though the same 2 commentators for 30 hours could get a bit much after a while - props to them for staying with it for so long)<br />
<br />
PS: Enhancement shammies showing up! I didn't expect to see the rogue/enhance/druid team unless the meta game was full of priests and locks, which it was. Although I didn't rate the play of the Enh that much - water shield kept dropping off, even when he was low on mana, and his totem usage was definitely below par.</div></div><hr />

Lol, GG America indeed. Europe sent 1 team which did not even make the Euro regionals (not even the 4th best team in EU) and they knock out all US teams including your 2nd/3rd seeds and only the best team in the US can beat them 6-4 with mostly counter comp (War/rouge/druid won them 4/6 games). From this tourny it's safe to assume the standard of high-level arena in EU is above US currently. It's gonna be funny to watch the white wash when the actual top EU teams with popular setups such as HERCULES/True Terror finally face US teams at the World Finals. US have yet to face any top EU wow teams in any tournament yet.<br />
<br />
With regards the finals, your totally wrong. Firstly Nihium's loss was most certainly not down to Cherez, the healers getting too offensive was clearly the reason as mentioned, though Hydra and Beasteh both played exceptionally overall. Also Cheerez got unluckily &quot;spec-countered&quot; in that Frag Dominant went Warrior when he we was Marksmanship, and Warlock when he was BM, which was the opposite of what he wanted. But besides warrior/rogue/druid is simply THE countercomp to dual mana drain teams, so if the US #1 team did lose to Nihilum that would have been highly embarassing.</div></div><hr />

You beat the 5th best EU team with 1 of 19 US teams in the tourny, and you're celebrating &quot;victory over EU&quot;. Lol, that's what I'm saying. Our 5th team &gt; your 2nd,3rd and 4th. You have yet to face any of the best EU teams HERCULES, True Terror, Sapped cows don't say Moo etc. It's just funny to see some massively arrogance from US players when they're clearly about to get thrashed at the World finals.</div></div><hr />

I'm merely making the point that US have yet to face any of the top EU teams, and that there was only 1 EU team to 19 US in MLG, so the have no right to say that.

Guild Master<br />
Awesome tournament! The stream was the best I've seen so far. WoW e-sport is gonna be huge if they can keep that up.<br />
<br />
Cherez, Hydra and Beasteh did an amazing tournament and with the experience from this tournament I'm sure they will win the next one. It really felt that Frag Dominant had the better nerves for the final and that's why they won.<br />
<br />
This was taken from Nihilums website. Maybe you trolls should stop trying to flame and be respectful. Both teams played great and were extraordinary. The did win with each makeup RRD, RLD,RWD atleast once. It's not easy to play modless as any class in arena. In fact alot of people rely on them for several things. Zyz is actually in my guild. Hydra was an amazing priest. Yes there is some RNG, but that's not to say that one or the other isn't skilled. Azazael knew how to play 3 classes efficiently, SpoH is a tourney vet and amazing, and zyz pulled off that amazing double sap deal in the Lower Finals. The only team to beat FD was Nihilum lets not forget. So I would say that it was an extremely close matchup and yes it could have gone either way, which made it so great and exciting to watch.<br />
<br />
They have to have a system where you can come back into the final from the lower bracket otherwise it wouldn't be very competitive. FD did have to beat another team at the top of the LB before they could come back to Nihil...</div></div><hr />
