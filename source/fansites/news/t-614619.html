Notice for Beta Testers on the PTRs<br />
Currently, there is an issue that prevents players participating in the Wrath of the Lich King beta from also participating on the public test realms. Our engineers are working to resolve this problem, and we hope to have it resolved by early next week. <br />
<br />
<br />
Beta Build 8926 - New Drake mounts !<br />

PTR 3.0.2 Patch Notes<br />
<br />
The latest test realm patch notes can always be found at http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/patchnotes/test-realm-patchnotes.html The latest patch notes can always be found at http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/patchnotes/&#13;&lt;h3&gt;General&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;&lt;ul&gt;&#13; All players will have their talent points reimbursed and will have access to new talents throughout their trees; this includes the 51-point talents. Several new spells and abilities have been added for all classes. Players will need to visit their class trainer to learn new spells.&#13; The Kirin Tor have made their move and so has Dalaran.Please watch your step around the crater that has been left behind!&#13; The Barber Shop has been implemented and you can now visit one of the Barber Shops in the major cities to change your appearance. Be sure to get your Shave and a Haircut!&#13; The all new Achievement System has been implemented and the Achievement panel can be accessed via the interface. While many achievements are not retroactive, we have done our best to credit as many as possible. Gamemasters will not be able to grant achievements for past accomplishements.&#13; Stormwind Harbor is now open for business.&#13; New towers have been added outside Of Orgrimmar and in Tirisfal Glades. Crews are currently at work to establish a new Zeppelin route to Northrend for your travel pleasure. Please no /spit off of the towers.&#13; A new entrance is now viewable in the Caverns of Time.&#13; Hit Rating, Critical Strike Rating, and Haste Rating now modify both melee attacks and spells.&#13; Spell casting and spell channeling pushback has been changed to the following:&#13;&lt;ul&gt;&#13; When casting a spell:&#13;&lt;ul&gt;&#13; The first and second hit will add .5 secs each to the cast time.&#13; All hits after the second will have no effect.&#13;[/list]&#13;&#13; When channeling a spell:&#13;&lt;ul&gt;&#13; The first and second hit reduces current duration by 25% of total duration each.&#13; All hits after the second will have no effect.&#13;[/list]&#13;&#13;&#13; Spellpower:&#13;&#13;&lt;ul&gt;&#13; All items and effects which grant bonuses to spell damage and spell healing are being consolidated into a single stat, Spellpower. This stat will appear with the same values found on items which grant “increased spell damage and healing” such as on typical Mage and Warlock itemization.&#13;&#13;&lt;ul&gt;&#13; For classes which do not heal, they should see no change in the character sheet other than new tooltip wording.&#13;[/list]&#13;&#13;&#13; Healing characters will see their bonus healing numbers on the character sheet decrease, however, all healing spells have been modified to receive more benefit from spellpower than they received from bonus healing, with a net effect of no change to the amount healed by their spells. Some talents have had to be rebalanced to accommodate this change, but the amount healed will remain roughly the same. In addition, some talents will provide only healing spell power.&#13;[/list]&#13;&#13;[/list]&#13;	[/list]&#13;&#13;&lt;h3&gt;Known Issues&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;ul&gt;&#13; The current patch notes are incomplete, but will be progressively more comprehensive in each patch.&#13;&#13; All classes are currently undergoing a balancing pass of all talent trees.&#13;&#13; Inscription is not fully implemented and still has non-functioning glyphs.&#13;[/list]&#13;&#13;&lt;h3&gt;Druids&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;&#13;&lt;ul&gt;&#13;&#13; Brambles (Balance): Now increases the damage done by your Treants, and also damage caused from your Treants and Barkskin has a 5/10/15% chance to Daze the target for 3 sec.&#13;&#13; Celestial Focus (Balance): The stun proc now works with Starfall.

<br />
But Windfury totem states &quot;Melee and Ranged Haste by 16%&quot;(unimproved) and Wrath of Air is &quot;Spell haste by whatever % it is&quot;, and as it stood originally they changed IFF to be all 3 (or like an item just stating hit), then changed it to specifically say &quot;Increases spell hit by 1/2/3%&quot;, which doesnt count as all 3 types of hit. Or at least as I said it doesnt on the beta just now.<br />
<br />
I seriously hope you're right though and it will be all 3 types of hit because i'm one of those physical dps'ers who loves the moonkin we bring to raids due to IFF and sharing the love with the casters rather than just completely moving it to them kinda sucks in a way.. I dont see it as balancing anything, rather just reversing the imbalance(Always thought it should be all 3 types of hit anyway)</div></div><hr />

<br />
But Blizzard has said that Wotlk would be released in Oct, Nov or Dec 2008, so we do not have 3 months.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not true if 3.0.2 goes live before the end of September.<br />
<br />
And Blizzard can push Wrath into 2009 if they want to.<br />
Early in the year they said it would be released in 2008, later they said it wouldn't be *before* Q4. They never reaffirmed the 2008 release window.</div></div><hr />

Many said that the 3.0 PTR would probably not be out for atleast another month either..<br />
<br />
&quot;on the PTRs for at least 2 months.&quot;<br />
Stop making guesses, everything in this PTR has been tested on the PTR, they're just allowing everyone to test it while they make some minor/major tweaks which didn't affect the major highlights (barber, new talents; although imbalanced, etc)<br />
<br />
They more or less guaranteed the expansion to be out in Q4, might as well be released in mid-october for all we know, they never give a rough estimate on dates ._.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2008 is the dead line... I think its quite impossible a 2009 release date. <br />
<br />
<br />
From Kotaku:<br />
According to several different store employees, the game will be streeting on November 4 for $40. 7-Eleven, we're told, will be selling the game starting at midnight. <br />
<br />
http://kotaku.com/5045310/wrath-of-the-lich-king-date-price<br />
<br />
<br />
IMHO the 3.0 will go live just before the Blizzcon, around 6 or 7 october... nearly after 1 mounth WotLK will be avaible in the stores.<br />
So, 4 november is a realistic date.</div></div><hr />

So, for clarification, their hair is somewhat translucent. Liken it, if you will, to those fibre-optic light string things. They're clear but look white. Opaque, see?</div></div><hr />

Hahaha. I'm deeply sorry about not having been educated on polar bears during my schooltime. I guess I must've been busy doing things that are actually important.<br />
<br />
In any case, I was laughing about the part where the poster said that their skin reflects snow, which is obviously nonsense since it looks white against any background. I'm honoured that you created a new account just to troll me though.</div></div><hr />

copy your entire WTF folder from 1 pc to the other. dont remake the macros on the 2nd pc. grab your addons too while you are at it. <br />
