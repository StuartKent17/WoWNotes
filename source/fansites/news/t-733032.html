Zones &amp; Instance Pages Update - Official Previews<br />
I updated some of the Cataclysm pages to include the official previews to add some lore background. I also fixed a couple of layout bugs and tried to improve the readability.<br />
<br />
The other good news is, I added Lightbox back to the new instances and new zones pages (the fancy screenshot viewer thing). You should be able to check everything without too much problem now, I will add it to the other pages tomorrow. <br />

Spell haste and Fireball / Frostbolt cast time<br />
I think the problem is actually with Early Frost. We just think that e.g. a 3.5 sec Fireball isn't really playable. You probably noticed that the low ranks of Fireball are even much faster, because the spell really isn't usable until the cast time is reduced.<br />
<br />
We are going to be much more vigilant about haste getting out of control (from talents and gear) to where GCD issues get to be a problem. Simply making non-haste stats more attractive will help as well. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626106700/what-s-going-on-w-mage-bolt-cast-times/))<br />

Discipline<br />
Discipline will still use PW:Shield a lot, but you will probably see less &quot;pre-healing&quot; across the board, because it won't be mana efficient. PW:Shield will probably go back to being more of an emergency button and less of the survivability buff it gets treated as today.<br />
<br />
In addition to shielding, Disc will continue to cast Penance a lot, and will probably use Heal and Greater Heal. Flash Heal overlaps in niche a lot with both PW:Shield and Penance, so it may be the least used. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626107959/save-power-word-shield/))<br />

Combat Tree<br />
Improved Sprint I will grant you doesn't have a lot of use in PvE.<br />
<br />
But Improved Kick and Improved Recuperate do. Improved Kick will be of situational use on bosses that can't be silenced, but Improved Recuperate will keep you alive. In a world where healer mana will be much more precious, minimizing wasted mana is going to be a bigger deal.<br />
<br />
We're not going to make trees where every point in a dps tree is a dps upgrade. Those are the kinds of talent builds we're trying to get away from, because they remove player choice. We are trying to engineer points in all trees where you have to choose between non-dps talent A and non-dps talent B, because as soon as A or B leads to dps, then the choice goes away.

Weapon Enchants<br />
Enchants are technically really complicated spells in WoW, so what we want to do and what we can do aren't always aligned without investing sometimes weeks of programmer time. I say that by way of heavy caveats, because none of this may actually come to pass.<br />
<br />
However, what we'd like to do is: A) Restrict DW to Enhancement only, B) Restrict shaman weapon enchants to being unique (meaning no WF / WF or FT / FT), and C) Remove the internal cooldown on Windfury, since once you can only have one, the proc rate won't be a balance problem. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626577195/cataclysm-windfury-imbue/))<br />

Passive survivability talents<br />
We just think at the end of the day that a warrior needs to look at their his talents and feel like they are making his survivability better. As an example, it's all well and good to have some fun or utility talents in the Disc priest tree, but if there also weren't some bread and butter talents to make you a better healer, Disc priests would feel cheated. Sword and Board is a fun Prot talent, but it doesn't improve your survivability directly in a very noticeable way.<br />
<br />
Imagine a new talent that was a 30% chance to lower the cooldown of your Last Stand, or a 30% chance to proc an armor buff on you. It might be an exciting talent, but it could also be really frustrating every time it didn't proc. For the same reason tanks tend to gear for mitigation over random avoidance, they'd probably be really skeptical of a talent that had a chance of lowering their damage taken. There's room for some talents like that, and Critical Block is an example, but a whole tree of them might get frustrating. You might feel like your survivability was out of your control and really at the mercy of encounter specifics or even a random chance for a proc.<br />
<br />
Put another way, we want players to have some choices in how they talent, but we don't want the whole tree to feel optional. A Prot warrior who chose to spend no talent points should feel like a really terrible tank, instead of just losing some utility or threat, in the same way an untalented healer should feel like they are sacrificing a lot of healing. Thus we think there is room for a few passive talents, especially for tanks, where having too many non-passive talents risks hurting consistency.

Are these ppl not sick and tired of this constant crying about how easy Tbc/LK was. The game needs to be enjoyable. Not tailored for the 7 days a week raider. If blizz can't keep the game appealing to the casuals ppl are going to leave for games that are.

(I prefer Jesse Cox videos, but this guy isn't bad, and the british accent was so fitting for the Worgen starting zone; yes he uploaded videos of that one and Gobbies)</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the people going on how he doesn't know about Stormwind or things like that - uh, yeah, he openly says that. You shouldn't act surprised. Of course, you are always free to go and find another beta videos from Youtube made by far more knowledgeable people. It's just that they will not be produced in the same quality as TB's stuff. Or simply not be there at all.<br />

TBC was more than fine and nobody ever has claimed it was too easy up until 2.4 badge change. And really, you think new people come to WoW to raid? Hell no, raiding is the last thing on their mind. They level, they do 5mans and MAYBE heroics. By the time they have finally gotten to raiding, they are more than ready for a proper challenge, not the neutered crap WotLK has treated them with. If you can't face the truth, tough, but game being too hard has NEVER been the reason new people don't join in. In fact, subscriptions have only been considerably dropping in WotLK, while constantly rising in Vanilla and TBC. Make your own conclusions from that.</div></div><hr />

We gear for mitigation because they made fights where receiving two consecutive hits without huge hp and armor meant a raid wipe. Then they added random raid pulse damage and such just to make matters worse. It's trained behavior. I like dodge/parry and I'm excited when I get to use them, but encounters punish you for it. <br />

I liked this post a lot then noticed who posted it. <br />
<br />
P.s. what is it he doesn't seem to know? His familiarization with Alliance territory was the only thing not quite perfect, but his knowledge was still to a decent extent. He recognized previously unaccessible areas as well as key points of the city. You're gonna belittle him for not recognizing the shade of tower #37 is slightly darker? Besides, his information regarding CC in 5-mans, systematic upgrades, new ideas, and of course eye candy was very useful to me.

I'd like to add to this that this guy has the most annoying, strangle-inducing voice ever. I can't stand listening to him.<br />
<br />
Would want someone that actually cares and knows something to do videos instead, that has a voice that is more pleasant to listen to then this scratching posh guy.<br />
<br />
I think posh is the worst description I've ever heard of TB. He has quite decent insights when it comes to WoW. And to be honest, I can't blame him for not knowing Stormwind from back to front. Seeing as he has always played Horde...</div></div><hr />

@Seregon I would have never made the connection to be honest, he was so loud and obnoxious in the TRH vid, and fairly laid back in the SW one.<br />
<br />
Also I play Alliance, and have no problem identifying Horde cities and towns. It's called knowing your material, or by extension, your enemy :P but I still thank the guy for the vid. Did he show the extra AH and Bank in the Dwarven District? Didn't get that far..</div></div><hr />

Agreed. I love the fact that the vast majority of people like the videos, that's great, the dislike votes on Youtube are in single figures (I was shocked by that) but I'm a big boy, I can handle criticism and sycophancy never got anyone anywhere. Some of the guys that dislike my videos might have suggestions to help improve them, they shouldn't be shouted at for expressing their opinion, they're entitled to it just as much as anyone else. They can always go and watch other videos if they're not fans of mine and if you want the visuals and not my narration, then there is a mute (and Vuvuzela) button.</div></div><hr />

Oh and posh guy? Not quite. I'm English and I can tell you he is not posh sounding. More like middle-class sounding, if I had to place it.<br />

and Noomz, why should people show you good manners when you show none yourself? If you had any sense you'd know TB is posting/reading here, yet you willingly insult in front of him. Sometimes, taking your opinion too far simply displays lack of tact, and I honestly thought you were intelligent enough to know better than that.

<br />
In the case of Stormwind, I have to wonder why so many self-proclaimed experts care about the commentary when they can easily see the changes for themselves and mute the video. Maybe I could see their point if I'd claimed I knew what I was talking about when it came to alliance areas I haven't been in for years, but I wear my ignorance of such things on my sleeve. Do you buy a used car that has in big red letters on the ad 'THIS CAR HAS A DENT IN THE PASSENGER DOOR' and then complain after doing so, that there's a dent in the passenger door?</div></div><hr />

<br />
They kind of hit every nail on the head. Its going to have three separate forces which hasn't been done since DAOC (which is part of what made the PvP so completely awesome in DAOC). It has actual action from the get go which hasn't been done in an MMO ever. It also has real live world events that SHOCK actually affect the outcome of the game as compared to standing in a box fighting each other or standing in a bigger box fighting each other. So, in short, every criticism they made directly targeted where Blizzard has managed to screw up WOW so badly. So, if they pull it off they are completely justified in criticizing stand in the box pvp where the focus is on keeping the carebears all safe and cuddly. I would also assume Jumpgate is non-con pvp, which is perfectly acceptable as long as their is not a pvp penalty.</div></div><hr />

Can't wait to try them. I hope we will wipe there so much. I want them to be hard and not only a place to grind. They are releasing the hard modes only in the 4.1 so if it will become easy we will still get a real hard mode to start with after the first tier. It could be actually good.<br />
<br />
You are making an assumption that it will take awhile to release 4.1. Also, I haven't heard anything about releasing hard modes (aside from heroic SFK and Dead Mines) in 4.1. As usual, it all comes down to how bad or how good your healer is. Five man instances have been balanced on the back of the healer since this game began. A lot of that damage just seemed more than capable of being healed through by any competent healer. Hell, its less damage than you currently take on the air ship, and I can pretty much single heal the air ship fight now. Of course, Blizzard is across the board nerfing healers, but how many times can one priest die in an instance?</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you can only bring 10% of the entire population you have lost. This isn't TBC anymore, people aren't content running Karazhan over and over while other players get the &quot;real&quot; loot. That style will never happen again, and if Blizzard even attempts it they are going to see their subscription rates drop by about 1/2. There is a huge market out there fighting over the same players, and eventually Blizzard will lose that fight simply because of the age of the game. Eventually, WoW will become UO 2.0.</div></div><hr />

I believe that harder content + better introduction will raise the average level of the players<br />
<br />
I am absolutely in favor of AoE content. I think people forget the reason that WotLK was so AoEable is because Blizzard made Vanilla and TBC such a CC nightmare. To the point that WAR used the lack of CC as one of their largest selling points. In the end, it all comes down to time investment, and CC leads to longer time investment. Players don't want to invest time into things like normal dungeons and heroics. They want to destroy them. Blizzard realized that in WotLK and then forgot about it in Cataclysm. I have a feeling we will see a huge uproar about that when the game goes live. Oh, and I think you are forgetting the 3 mage groups for MgT. Another reason cc completely fails is just how much better some classes are at it than others. I can't wait to see 3 mage groups for the first heroics because they won't be doable without cc and we all know only mages can cc. WTG Blizzard.<br />

you think new people come to WoW to raid? Hell no, raiding is the last thing on their mind.<br />
<br />
<br />
You could not be more wrong. People come to WoW for one of two reasons: 1) They are a MMO gamer and want to try something new in which case they want raid content or 2) They have friends in the game that are raiding in which case they want raid content.<br />
<br />
No one comes here to run the same 5 mans over and over since Blizzard doesn't bother to support 5 man group play other than throwing them a few bones every now and then.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
By the time they have finally gotten to raiding, they are more than ready for a proper challenge, not the neutered crap WotLK has treated them with. <br />
<br />
<br />
I think statistics prove how wrong you really are, but lets look at it more honestly. There are a lot of really good players in really bad guilds. I personally refuse to do more work getting into a guild than I did to get my current job. Its just not going to happen. Instead, I'm just going to say screw it and go do something else with my money. I'm sure more people agree with me than with you based on the fact that Blizzard (who does amazing market research) agrees with me and not you.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you can't face the truth, tough, but game being too hard has NEVER been the reason new people don't join in. In fact, subscriptions have only been considerably dropping in WotLK, while constantly rising in Vanilla and TBC. Make your own conclusions from that.<br />
<br />
Actually, you are pulling those numbers out of your ass because Blizzard says subscriptions are rising. Also, you can't really look at it that way at all. The sheer number of people that never bothered to get past Karazhan in TBC simply proves how wrong you are. The difference is that when TBC and Vanilla were out you got a choice between EQ2 and WoW, and everyone chose WoW. Now you have a choice between 30+ games and a lot of those games are just as polished as WoW is if not more so, so people are more likely to chose them if WoW pisses them off.<br />

challenging content is fun and content you can do with your eyes closed isn't.<br />
<br />
Challenging content is fun THE FIRST TIME. However, when you are grinding the instance for the 100th time looking for that one item that only drops from the last boss but never drops because the RNG hates you, you don't want challenge you want mind numbing content you can sleep through in an AoE fest. That is the whine every player had in TBC that resulted in WotLK, and since Blizzard never finds middle ground they are switching it back to CC or die mentality which will result in everyone whining about CC being needed. People are never happy. Blizzard needs to figure that out before its to late.<br />

Those videos were stupid. That guy doesn't have a fricking clue what he's talking about (and most of it is content that's been around since 2004). Really pathetic. Plenty of better videos out there.<br />
<br />
If there are plenty of other &quot;better&quot; videos out there discussing the changes in Cataclysm then by all means post links. Until then, bugger off as the Brits would say. Also, if you have never played Alliance then it doesn't matter that SW has been out since 2004 because you have never bothered to see it unless you were killing Alliance in it, and that take would come from a PvPer not a raider.</div></div><hr />

There was nothing about him that was a turn off. He was funny, charming and sounded damn sexy. I really do believe this comes down to an English vs USA thing yet again. I totally feel his videos belong here because mmo-champion should be (IMO) a collection of people that love WoW enough to talk about it on a forum, and those videos are from someone who truly does love the game enough to put that much effort into talking about it.<br />

Yes because we all know how incredibly easy heroic versions of FOS, POS and HOR are. So incredibly easy that most groups refuse to do HOR when it comes up as the daily. We also know that Occulus was such a bloody joke because everyone just loves it right? <br />
<br />
Come on, if you guys can't stop bitching about Occulus, I can't wait to see you guys take on a real challenge if one is presented in Cataclysm.<br />

finally the nubstances are starting to show some biteback in terms of difficulty<br />
<br />
I think people that make these comments have been 80 for a long time and out geared low level WotLK instances even longer, but really the only difficulty comes in the amount of damage dished out by mobs, and as someone who just made a discipline priest let me tell you that UtK does a CRAP load of group damage at level 70-72. I dare say it does less group damage in Heroic than it does in normal at that level. Maybe its just because in heroic the mobs actually die faster because people are more properly geared or over geared.</div></div><hr />

By the time they have finally gotten to raiding, they are more than ready for a proper challenge, not the neutered crap WotLK has treated them with.

<br />
Yes I will draw my own conclusions. The drop could be anything, heck maybe the economy even we don't know. And I didn't say anything that was related to that. <br />
I think this how you feel about the game. Beying ready for a proper chalange and not even done a 5 man heroic ... please...<br />
I know how it is to run and do things the hard way. Hell been playing since day one. And iam favor for never going back to that way again. Not able to run an instance correctly because you can't find the right cc. Shadow Lab., Magisters Terrace, those where places if you where the wrong class you didn't get to go. Not sure the new instances will be like that. But Telling me the majority wants to spend 1-2 hour in an instance I refuse to believe that. Even 30 mins now takes way to long for most of the players. <br />
Strange that he was talking cc when the majority of the time he ran in like an idiot and tried to aoe the mobs. Asking for more difficulty but can't hack it when it comes to it. The only thing he was doing was giving the priest a shit load of extra work.</div></div><hr />

I think he might have been pointing out that you don't need CC to survive many of the encounters. Also, did you notice him sheeping some mobs only to see the sheep be instantly broken. Why bother ccing if the tank thinks he can AoE tank the mobs and in many cases it appears he can, and since when do healers complain about more work? I love it when players pull from the tank on my druid because it means I might actually have to use swiftmend or nature's swiftness for once.</div></div><hr />

I guess you're not familiar with the difference between a demonstration and an actual run. I AOEed the mobs to see if I could (and it turns out that no, in many areas you can't and focus firing one at a time is a better option). <br />

There is a very easy solution to this. Get a guild, Cataclysm is designed for guild play, heck until Wrath, WoW in general was designed for it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wrath heroics can be tough if you aren't doing it with 5k+ GS players. Do them in the gear you were intended to do them with. They had plenty of challenge.<br />
<br />
This really isn't true at all. Our guild was demolishing Wrath Heroics in Blue Gear a week after launch. The perception of difficulty has only come to light recently because of the LFG system, which matches random people, many of whom are awful at the game and have no idea what they're doing, together into disorganised non-guild groups. Saying that Wrath Heroics are hard in poor gear with a lowsy group is like saying writing is hard when you have no arms and your eyes have been pecked out by crows.</div></div><hr />

This is so wrong.<br />
<br />
Occulus wasn't hard, it was annoying, had a horrible vehicle combat mechanic, and since it was a non-linear 3-dimensional dungeon it often caused players who hadn't seen it before to get hopelessly lost, pulling loads of dragons on to the group, which would proceed to destroy those people who had dropped their drake. This isn't 'hard' content, its BAD GAME DESIGN.<br />
<br />
Halls of Reflection was hard, but it was also annoying and boring. It was wave based at the start in such a way that the most popular strategy involved standing in a corner. This is NO FUN - this, combined with the retard factor inherent in a system like the Dungeon Finder, lead to it being unbearable despite not challenging any player with an IQ above 20 (all 2% of us).<br />
<br />
Pit of Saron and Forge of Souls, on the other hand, are great fun with a group that is not terminally stupid. While they aren't too hard, they do have some nice and fatal mechanics (always nice, nothing like fire that doesn't burn you), and a little challenging trash (mostly looking at PoS here). These have only been received negatively by the very retards that shouldn't be able to do them, and the &quot;WAAH GEARSCORE&quot; crowd that hates the gear requirement imposed by blizzard. For everyone else, they have been a breath of fresh air in an otherwise suffocating 5-man lineup.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The thing about Occulus being hard, yeah right, after the first two attempts at that last boss it became so damn easy to complete that instance, the difficulty in Occulus came from finding people willing to drudge their way through such horrible vehicle combat, my big issue with the instance came from the hoping on and hoping off all throughout of it, I wouldn't of found such issue with the instance if say you only got onto the drakes for the last fight or somewhere in the middle of the instance instead of through the entire thing.<br />

Seriously before pointless attacks on people realise you dont have to watch the videos, its something the guy did in his spare time as he enjoys the game and wanted to share his thoughts with the community.<br />

You would be the first person to complain about the camera, which makes me wonder if it's an issue at all, particularly since many others have remarked that they are pleased with the camerawork. I suppose it's expected that feedback will contain contradictions, but I'm going to stick with the majority for now, camera motions are deliberately slow, smooth and done on a 5600dpi mouse to ensure the best results. It's certainly not perfect, but I dare say it's better than most videos of this type.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's all fair, to a commentator that insults faction, races, classes in his vids. Asking people to be nice after that seems strange. Want to see vids by someone who doesn't drop the comments that he does, but I guess people are feeling lazy. Prob better if there is just music n no commentary, or at least only when something important happens.<br />
<br />
Remember seeing the tBC starting Belf areas, mostly music. Short text is probably better than any voice, if its horribly sounding (like TB's is). N just Biscuit, wtf is up with that, cookie sounds better, biscuit makes something that tastes good sound totally gay. That's a crime in my book.<br />
<br />
Lastly, he does reply a lot even though he claims he doesn't take vids seriously just &quot;demos&quot; as he said, bit bored or touchy, don't know don't care. The thread should about the subject matter, not what he thinks about those who disagree with him, there is no way to stop disagreement, so why bother so much?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because he has an enormous ego. If you have ever dealt with him personally or talked with anyone who has ever worked with him, they will tell you this. Hell, even he will tell you this. The only remedy is not to publicly argue against him on a medium he has moderator power over (cause even if you win, you'll get kicked/banned for hurting his fragile ego), or don't play with him on any game that you can take any blame in the loss in, cause he'll rage (for him losing, cause again you hurt his fragile ego).<br />
<br />
You do see that when either a specific aspect of his video is criticized or that the entire video is criticized, he mentions either that the majority like it or a large portion like it. The sample base is teeny tiny.<br />
<br />
Check a few pages back for the butthurt comments about EJ. He doesn't care but he still cares enough to bash EJ.<br />
<br />
All in all, mute the audio and press on, or find screenshots.</div></div><hr />

People are giving him too much credit, but I guess its mostly kids. Vids get high interest for the displayed content, doesn't mean he is doing something brilliant in them. He runs around mostly talking gibberish, almost every trash mob gets 'honored' with an irrelevant comment.<br />
<br />
Runs around babbling, frapsing n puting it up on the internet, which most everyone else can do, but are too lazy or have better things to do. One has to be a kid to say he is brilliant etc. way to much praise here. It's not a machinima, he is just recording what others (blizz) has created.</div></div><hr />

If you are getting a free meal, you'll listen to the chef and damn well like it, alternatively, leave the restaurant. If you're going to use a stupid analogy, then make sure it's logically sound first. Crying about free videos which, let's be honest right now, are the best quality you're going to find, is incredibly childish.

U simply recorded Blizzard's work, hiting fraps is hard you think? Anyone can do better editing than you did, there is nothing worth 'hating'. It's just amazement that something so simple gets so argued over. I bet u put more energy into forums than making vids.<br />
<br />
Nice 101 editing n I wouldn't have bothered to tell u that if u weren't such a prick.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
No, what they want to talk about is CATACLYSM n they would have preferred not to see a bit of it so opinionated by whoever put it up. If I wanted a meal for example, I don't want to listen to the fucking chef rambling on.<br />
<br />
How old are you? You are taking a three letter word and simplifying down to &quot;u&quot;. I take it you have never made a high quality gaming video before, it isn't as easy as pressing &quot;GO!&quot;. Stop flaming the man and give the guy the respect he deserves.<br />
<br />
Keep up the good work TB, thanks for the pro beta vids.</div></div><hr />

Every previous ban aside, the message he was banned for in the end was &quot;Who here has a job in the gaming industry reviewing games?&quot; <br />
<br />
You replied, saying it was a last straw, and banned him for the very short remainder of WCRadio's life, then belittled the job you got pissed enough for him apparently flaunting. Even the other mods thought it was a stupid reason to ban somebody, but hey, he crossed your ego and why argue with the guy when you can just ban him and get the last word?<br />
<br />
It's as stupid as your wife permanently banning a drunk troll after baiting him.<br />

Ah, the &quot;it's free&quot; excuse, didn't see that one coming when you have nothing to defend yourself with. Frapsing is hard.<br />

Yeah please, let's bitch about gameplay videos because they aren't as difficult as composing a symphony.

I've been observing these forums for quite a while, and the best thing is to just not get into any kind of discussions since you'll probably be overrun by 10 year old trolls that think they're mature (like Summerdrake). <br />

Not that TotalBiscuit seems to need any help, but from a fellow Brit I'd say to you if it was easy and you can do a better job of it, with better commentry and editing... well do it then. Post it here, get on the front page of MMOC and everyone can Praise / Flame your work.<br />

Really, it doesn't make a blind bit of difference. People always get butthurt and upset when someone else is getting attention, they resort to whatever they can, attack, project their insecurities on other people. 5 years on the WoW Europe forums, you're pretty much immune to anything anyone here can throw at you. Big deal, a couple of guys are angry on the internet, in the meantime, almost half a million views thanks to Bibi, thousands of new subscribers, hundreds of dollars in site ad revenue, thousands of positive comments. In the grand scheme of things, weighing up all that, a couple of angry people on MMO Champion and a guy butthurt over some ban months ago on a website that no longer exists, isn't even worth mentioning. Happy to give as good as I get though until either they shut up or somebody steps in to put a stop to it.</div></div><hr />

You're the only one who actually thinks that, what does that say about your ego? What does your opinion matter vs that of the vast majority of others? (OMG SAMPLE SIZE, *INSERT OTHER TERRIBLE DEFLECTION HERE*) Isn't it incredibly egotistical and arrogant of you to believe that your opinion holds any water or merit vs so many other positive remarks?

Because it is expected therefore not necessary for most to bother, they know it will be up. It's about recording what Blizzard has done, there is not much 'effort' done from the recorder.<br />

<br />
You're the only one who actually thinks that, what does that say about your ego? What does your opinion matter vs that of the vast majority of others?<br />
<br />
They are happy to see the content and go &quot;oboy!&quot; that doesn't mean this was quality stuff on your part, but from Blizzard, their fanbase is huge, that explains those numbers. So it's me vs Blizzard? My argument was with YOU. A-N-Y-O-N-E would have gotten loads of positive replies due to the CONTENT displayed, that u happened to record, not do. This isn't me vs someone who has done something outstanding.<br />

I also can speak for a matter of fact that getting this quality video's is not easy and just a matter of frapsing, you have to fraps, edit, encode properly (so it looks decent), then make use youtube doesn't blow it up, and then you are ready, and he does it in his free time.<br />

<br />
Other than y'know, the mentioned effort. But let's ignore that of course because that would contradict what you're saying. Apparently massive amounts of creativity is required for a video to be worthy of consumption by Summerdrake, high visual and audio fidelity and time spent aren't good enough.<br />
