We recently completed a wave of suspensions for World of Warcraft accounts that were found to be operating third-party software that undermines the security of the World of Warcraft client. Reverse engineering and bypassing security protocols that safeguard against client modification is a clear violation of our Terms of Service, and we regularly take action against such behavior.<br />
<br />
Many of the suspensions issued were for 180 days, as the exploit we detected allows for very malicious activities such as gameplay automation or rotation/interrupt botting. Upon further review, we found that some suspended accounts appeared to be only using the detected exploit to do client-side character model alteration. That is an activity that we would prefer to respond to with a warning, rather than a suspension, this time. As a result, we have reversed all of the suspensions issued in this action.<br />
<br />
The use of third party software that modifies the World of Warcraft game client is against our Terms of Service. We expect players to remove such third party software, or their accounts will be subject to further action. Any future use of software that bypasses the security of the game client, regardless of intention or gameplay advantage, will be detected and sanctioned with increased penalties.</div></div><hr />

You don't know that and that's the issue.<br />
<br />
Blizzard personally doesn't care about mods that change your tits size, but they do care when someone is changing the client and when they detect that they can't just easily know what these changes are for.<br />
<br />
You could for example change the terrain in a way that benefits you, like that one guild did in AQ40 where they removed a piece of the floor after the first boss so that they could skip all bosses and reach Cthun directly... or how on private servers players change the map of WSG in such a way that they can pick up the flag and go through a tunnel under the world to their homebase, or how players have changed the map of Molten Core so that they could safely mine dark iron ore.<br />
<br />
And like who knows, maybe even just a harmless tits mod can have some unexpected consequence. Maybe changing the size of your tits will have an effect on the client-side hitbox which could mean that you could be small enough to fit through some things you weren't supposed to etc etc<br />

Tiddy mods are just collateral damage here because it's practically impossible to intelligently differentiate one model edit mod from another without making Warden resource-intensive (when Warden being very light on resource use is one of its best features).<br />
<br />
<br />
i really think they should just give a nude option for the game, like how conan exiles does it. have a setting where you see full, partial, or no nudity.When Blizz is constantly trying to entice new/returning players, getting rerated M by the ESRB is only going to hurt their chances in the age of Fortnite and Minecraft.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's definitely been no large model edit banwaves in the whole of BFA, Legion or WoD till this point. I'm not aware of any banwaves on this scale for use of these things earlier than that, though of course I've heard individual reports of random small groups of people... but honestly they're probably botters who don't wanna admit it ;)<br />
<br />
Certainly there has never been a banwave on this scale before. And no reported bans for at least the last 5 years.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Moral of the story is, you're playing Russian roulette with clientside edits; even if Warden doesn't catch it now, doesn't mean it never will, and if Warden isn't catching it don't go around talking about it.</div></div><hr />

Nah it's not that. <br />
<br />
There's a bit more to it but it's probably not what I'm allowed to discuss here in any detail, mmo-champion frowns on it I think.<br />
<br />
Suffice it to say it's more related to a newer &quot;streamlined&quot; method of getting these things to work which shares some backdoors with some well known botting software and that's what caused these things to get suddenly caught up in the same banwave.</div></div><hr />

That's the easy thing to point out for people, but it also did other things such as changing the appearance of whole zones, changin races around (so say, tauren will replace draenei NPCS and your Draenei mage will look like a tauren mage to you) and so on, any visual change you can think of. Sometimes that could involve changes that gave you an advantage in Bgs/arenas.*<br />

Thankfully most of this isn't so easily done any more after the way they changed up the game files in WoD/Legion. It used to be very easy to change the sizes of models and hitboxes to affect gameplay.<br />
<br />
Although majority of people affected by the recent banwave are people using armor reskins (changing armor mogs to look different... e.g. higher definition, skimpier, cooler, whatever), nude mods and personal model swaps (playing as bosses, reskinning your weapon to corrupted ashbringer, etc) on the client side.</div></div><hr />

i really think they should just give a nude option for the game, like how conan exiles does it. have a setting where you see full, partial, or no nudity.Conan Exiles also has an ESRB rating of M, something I'm sure Blizzard would like to avoid for WoW.</div></div><hr />

i'm of the mind that nudity shouldn't warrant more than a T rating.<br />
<br />
but the way things are starting to become more puritanical these days, i'm surprised if nudity doesn't start causing an AO rating.</div></div><hr />

Post proof I know exactly who it happened to and the only permabans for model swapping had nothing to do with using tmorph or the like to change race or armor appearance they were to do with wall removal and making flags and nodes supersized. Hell I used tmorph back during tot since you basically had to be a troll because of extra damage to beast bosses and I hate the aesthetics of troll never got a warning let alone a ban.<br />

You don't understand how logic works.

The problem is that they don't just mod the appearance of their own character. They mod the appearance of other characters too, including their size, which is an issue with PvP.</div></div><hr />

some got banned for 1-3 months .<br />
<br />
A guild mate wrote a mail said he was &quot;sorry&quot; and got unbanned.. not that it stopped him , one day in progress our boss did not want to reset he used a teleport hack , flew to the boss and used vanish to reset the boss . faster than a ticket . <br />

Oh btw same guy the bought a level 1 toon with all trading card mounts and gladator titles for 500€... <br />

I worked for Blizz from 2005-2012. They always permabanned for client manipulation that was with the expressed purposes of damaging gameplay. <br />
<br />
About 2014 they started issuing longer bans. The old system we had only had a few options, called GMTool. It had warning, 3 hour suspension, 1 day suspension, 3 day suspension, 7 day suspension, and perma banned. We were not able to put longer dates on things, but we regularly permabanned.</div></div><hr />

I understand the art team. They cannot go crazy sexy with those modells/gear because tha game is rated T but as you said the art team doesn't even know how women look like in real life (not like the kultirans... WTF). <br />

Wouldn't surprise me if they decide to add this as part of a pack. With the in game store eventually. Now imagine if they started doing that with addons. Restricting the player made addons and implementing some of there own to the store. Making it were raiders and casuals would have to buy the ones from the store.

But I like this reversal. I think Ion may be getting emails from the top, along the lines of &quot;Dude, that's a bit harsh for sloot mods - and do I need to remind you we're fighting to retain subs here?.&quot; Someone at Blizzard seems to be calling out the decisions, and that's great, whether it's Brack, the new producer, Ion, whoever. It's a good direction. <br />
<br />
It's a good sign they're willing to reverse bad decisions, like this, and the portals. The WoW devs have oddly dug their heels into the sand on some issues in the past, nice to see someone is keeping that from happening,<br />

i really think they should just give a nude option for the game, like how conan exiles does it. have a setting where you see full, partial, or no nudity.Apparently yuou have no iedea how game ratings work. If they allowed for full nudity, they would have to change their rating to MA which would drastically change how the game can be sold.<br />
<br />

<br />
People seem to forget that those Adult Mods is what keeps those people playing, without it they simply unsub and never touch WoW again. And we're talking quite a large player base here.<br />
<br />
Ofcourse Blizzard has all the rights in the world to ban those people, but it will cut Sub numbers quite a lot.<br />
<br />
It all boils down to... is it worth banning them if they're harmless, despite breaking the rules.<br />
<br />
Blizzard knows about these Mods for a long long time, and always let it slip.No ti isn't Not even close.</div></div><hr />

I think what needs to happen is an overhaul of how world of warcraft is installed and viewed on a clientside-level. People should be able to select only expansions they want to download and content they want to use. People should be able to say that all BFA tier gear now looks like BC tier gear.

Banning people for using these tools is stupid, because the people who ethically use the tools will continue to find or develop new ones, and those that unethically use the tools will do the same. This is a case of not allowing people to play the game in the way they want to play it, and every time in the past, this has resulted in further backlash. Either let the people keep their hacky little tool and ban people using it maliciously, or actually take the time and money to develop a system from the groundlevel that would be an alternative to it.</div></div><hr />

I personally don’t care but if blizz doesn’t want people messing with shit like that then you probably shouldn’t. <br />

They were nice enough to unban people who were modding giant nelf tiddies, if you don’t wanna get banned don’t do it again. There’s a lot of other places you can find nudity and giant tiddies, doesn’t need to be WoW. No reason to be screeching about it.<br />

The quote isn't, &quot;You can't have your cake and then eat it.&quot; The quote is that, &quot;You can't have your cake and eat it too.&quot; If you eat it, then you no longer have it. It's a matter of concurrency. The AND function considers the variables at a single moment in time.<br />
<br />
It depends on your primary language on the definition of &quot;have&quot;. Have is not only used as a term for possession but also is primarily used as a word describing &quot;to consume or do&quot;. &quot;I have eggs for breakfast.&quot; &quot;We'll have a beer.&quot;<br />
<br />
So &quot;You can have your cake&quot; can be read as &quot;You can consume your cake&quot; which can cause confusion or a misunderstanding when phrased in one way but not the other.<br />
<br />
Read this link that the original quoted person responded with. <br />
<br />
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_can%27t_have_your_cake_and_eat_it<br />
<br />
<br />
Paul Brians, Professor of English at Washington State University, states that a more logical or easier to understand version of the saying is, &quot;You can’t eat your cake and have it too.&quot; Brians writes that a common source of confusion about this idiom stems from the verb to have which in this case indicates that once eaten, keeping possession of the cake is no longer possible, seeing that it is in your stomach (and no longer exists as a cake).[16]<br />
<br />
Alternatively, the two verbs can be understood to represent a sequence of actions, so one can indeed &quot;have&quot; one's cake and then &quot;eat&quot; it. Consequently, the literal meaning of the reversed idiom doesn't match the metaphorical meaning. The phrase can also have specialized meaning in academic contexts; classicist Katharina Volk of Columbia University has used the phrase to describe the development of poetic imagery in Latin didactic poetry, naming the principle behind the imagery's adoption and application the &quot;have-one's-cake-and-eat-it-too principle&quot;.[17]<br />
<br />
In English, &quot;have&quot; can mean &quot;eat&quot;, as in &quot;Let's have breakfast&quot; or &quot;I'm having a sandwich&quot;. So the saying &quot;You can't have your cake and eat it too&quot; may mean that you can't eat the cake and then eat it again; or less metaphorically, that what you want is unreasonable. This interpretation makes sense in both the &quot;have-eat&quot; and &quot;eat-have&quot; iterations of the idiom, and might explain why the earliest known iteration is &quot;have-eat&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Blizz has ALWAYS known about the cosmetic changes to characters as this has been a thing since Vanilla AND since Vanilla they have turned a blind eye to it. Is that fucking understood you idiots ? Blizzard has always known about this and have never taken any action against it so shut the hell up about the ToS shit already as it's a joke and enforced as often as jaywalking fines.<br />
<br />
Since the end of Legion, Blizz decided to further strengthen their security and because of the changes to the game caused by it people had to create custom launchers that bypassed Warden as it was the only way to get the mods to work again. Now that being said and me being a part of this since Arctium has been a thing, I HAVE NEVER seen anyone make a mod that increases the size of ore/herbs or remove walls etc... NEVER. <br />
Talking to the author of the launcher however has confirmed that indeed people could use it towards that purpose if they had the technical skill, but more importantly because the launcher messed with Warden, it made it easier for bots to play the game, which was an unintended consequence and the main reason for all the bans. <br />
<br />
The whole premise for making the launcher was for character cosmetics and nothing else, no one found this on a hacking forum and decided to change its purpose as it was designed like this from ground up. It was not because of the changes to ore/herbs/pvp shit etc as not only is it impossible for Blizz to tell what changes you made, but again, I have never in all of these years seen people use it for anything but the cosmetics.<br />

Blizz is like Burger King, &quot;Have it your way&quot; as long as it's the way we tell you to have it. So what if some pervs want to have big breasted female models? So what if someone wants to make it easier to play dungeons and raids? You're telling me Method doesn't use mods to keep their oh-so important world first lead? You're telling me that Blizzard takes issue with this but not the thousands of disgusting, perverted erotic TRP and MRP profiles in Moon Guard, Wyrmrest Accord and even other RP servers?<br />
<br />
Personally, I would love to be able to mod my Hunter's gun to sound like a GUN and not a stapler, or to have my character say custom dialogue options when I make an emote. But nooooo, that's against their ToS...<br />
<br />
I'm not reading the rest of this thread because it's clear that the only people who don't agree with Blizzard's action here are strange, niche weirdos who want to force other people to accept their fetishes, but what you're saying at the end of your post is wrong, and absolutely doable within the current modding structure.<br />
<br />
I'd encourage you to look into this more, if you actually care and you're not just complaining because you think it makes you look cool. You can make a macro that will play a particular sound file from the game whenever you /cry, for example. You could also pretty easily make a mod that plays the old gun sound effect every time you auto shot, and you could even go so far as to play a different sound for every different ability if you really wanted to.<br />

Fuck me you people are so self-righteous it's pathetic. Something you call &quot;cosmetic&quot; is literally taking money out of Blizzard's pockets, because if you wanted a dwarf mage instead of your current human one you would either pay Blizzard for a paid race change, or you would pay Blizzard in terms of actually logging into the game and playing to level a dwarf mage, which contributes to their MAUs. If you use a hack engine to replace your human mage with a dwarf mage, you're avoiding both of those legitimate ways to accomplish what you want. <br />
<br />
Blizzard, as a publically traded company, literally cannot allow widespread undermining of one of its avenues of revenue generation. If a shareholder were to ask why micro transaction revenues were down and Blizzard responded &quot;oh yeah some losers wanted to see big cartoon tits on their WoW characters and as a result have also avoided using race changes or level boosts, but we're 100% okay with people undermining the integrity of our game engine and client because they said it's just cosmetic&quot; that shareholder would sell, investors in general would see that as Blizzard not actually being committed to profit, and things would go downhill very quickly.<br />
<br />
You can argue as much as you want about whether you think the current prices for race changes are justifiable or anything else. But, while those services still exist and while your only other option is contributing to Blizzard's MAUs, they're absolutely within their rights to ban you, regardless of your little sad anecdote about how ethical the reverse engineering community is.</div></div><hr />

It should also be noted (and people here saying it was fine to do the model changes, it was the way around warden that was getting them banned should pay attention) Blizzard in their statement has made it pretty clear that they put the warning in place (over bans) to avoid banning people using it benignly getting long bans but that from now on you use such things at your own risk. ie.

This IS Blizzards property and you have a privilege to play it, play by the rules, obey the rules and if you don't like the rules, feel free to find another game, I don't care if you wanna run around with nothing or you want to look like Zod or Znork or whoever, if it breaks the Terms of Agreement, learn to live with it or find another game that lets you customize to the best of your ability. <br />
<br />

Something you call &quot;cosmetic&quot; is literally taking money out of Blizzard's pockets, because if you wanted a dwarf mage instead of your current human one you would either pay Blizzard for a paid race change, or you would pay Blizzard in terms of actually logging into the game and playing to level a dwarf mage, which contributes to their MAUs. If you use a hack engine to replace your human mage with a dwarf mage, you're avoiding both of those legitimate ways to accomplish what you want. <br />
<br />
Blizzard, as a publically traded company, literally cannot allow widespread undermining of one of its avenues of revenue generation. If a shareholder were to ask why micro transaction revenues were down and Blizzard responded &quot;oh yeah some losers wanted to see big cartoon tits on their WoW characters and as a result have also avoided using race changes or level boosts, but we're 100% okay with people undermining the integrity of our game engine and client because they said it's just cosmetic&quot; that shareholder would sell, investors in general would see that as Blizzard not actually being committed to profit, and things would go downhill very quickly.<br />
<br />
You can argue as much as you want about whether you think the current prices for race changes are justifiable or anything else. But, while those services still exist and while your only other option is contributing to Blizzard's MAUs, they're absolutely within their rights to ban you, regardless of your little sad anecdote about how ethical the reverse engineering community is.<br />
<br />
Eh, Blizzard's primary form of income from WoW is still likely subscriber numbers, and if that isn't their primary source of income from this game, you have a lot more to worry about than titty mods.<br />
<br />
From what I've seen of the scene, people mod their characters into things that wouldn't normally be available via other methods. Can't race change your character into a naga for example, but I know I've seen mods do that, and you certainly can't level up your character's proportions.<br />
<br />
And you can mock the WoW-porn scene all you want, but it's oddly a sign of a game's longevity. When it dries up, it's usually a sign that the game is, well, fucked.</div></div><hr />

I doubt they really care if you edit your models to look like the old ones or give your orc bigger boobs (which is what a lot of people use it for) or basically anything aesthetic. Pretty sure they just don't want people using it to gain some kind of game advantage, even if it's as minor as making herbs/ore giant to see them from far away, but since there's no way to efficiently distinguish between the two (from what I understand) then it's all banned.<br />

Let's see. Things you could do in the game by hacking:<br />
Increase the size of herb/mine nodes for better visibility;<br />
Increase the size of the PvP flag in BGs for better visibility;<br />
Alter terrain to your advantage, like wall-hack-jumping, to get to safety in BGs while holding flags;<br />
Greatly increase your character's speed without buffs in BGs;<br />
Automate your character (i.e. botting);<br />

You are correct with the size of the nodes. However i would argue that since nodes are not loaded till you get into a certain proximity this is not that big of a deal. Im not sure about the flag in Warsong-gulch tho, so i agree. I didn't think of that actually.<br />
<br />
Altering the terrain however has always been done via different third-party programs. This is different from how players altered texture files. In fact this is more akin to an injector like evermorph or lucidmorph and co. I did not hear from anybody using those being banned in this wave. I do use that, and i wasn't banned either. You can not increase your character speed with this method as the position of your character is taken up serverside ever since some assholes used noggit back in the day to alternate the map-file to run underneath the Battleground, but i admit im not sure in what way lag-switches are applicable in wow for this method. If you try to break barriers in WoW's open world though, you hard-disconnect and... (because serverside) get set back to the last, server-recorded position if you log back in though and im sure this works the same way in battlegrounds. Botting is also done differently and why &quot;Fly in no-fly areas&quot; doesn't work is the same reason why the speed increase doesn't.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ielenia</div><div class="date">2019-04-28, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">TNow that being said and me being a part of this since Arctium has been a thing, I HAVE NEVER seen anyone make a mod that increases the size of ore/herbs or remove walls etc... NEVER. <br />
Have you actually looked for it? I mean, really looked, as if honestly interested about that? It's not like those guys actually advertise their mods and put adds in MMO fansites. I mean, I played Skyrim for almost a year before I finally found out about the Skyrim modding community when stumbled upon a Skyrim mod video on YouTube.<br />
<br />
By the way: I have never seen someone make a botting mod for WoW either, but I do know those bots exist, since I've seen bots working in WoW back in the day. You not seeing those hack mods being made does not mean they do not exist.<br />
<br />
<br />
Talking to the author of the launcher however has confirmed that indeed people could use it towards that purpose if they had the technical skill, but more importantly because the launcher messed with Warden, it made it easier for bots to play the game, which was an unintended consequence and the main reason for all the bans. <br />
<br />
The whole premise for making the launcher was for character cosmetics and nothing else, no one found this on a hacking forum and decided to change its purpose as it was designed like this from ground up. It was not because of the changes to ore/herbs/pvp shit etc as not only is it impossible for Blizz to tell what changes you made, but again, I have never in all of these years seen people use it for anything but the cosmetics.<br />
Guess why those guys who use this launcher got caught in the ban-wave? It's highly likely because their launcher was doing the same thing (i.e. &quot;injecting code&quot;), or similar enough, to what the more harmful hack mods do. If it wasn't doing that, it wouldn't have caught.<br />
<br />
I mean, a turtle can be caught in a fishing net. Does that mean turtles are fish?<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Even after explaining in detail the actual reason behind the ban the imbeciles are still at it...&quot;bUt iT bReK TOs, iZ bAnS Xd&quot;<br />
Those that used the hack launcher simply to alter their characters' looks in ways that do not harm the game were quickly unbanned, since they were not doing any &quot;botting/automation&quot;. But that does not mean they did not break the ToS.</div></div><hr />

By making them bigger, you can also make it so you can interact with them from a greater distance.<br />
<br />
<br />

Yes, but those programs do basically the same thing: they &quot;inject alien code&quot; to the game, hence why they got caught in the net. Basically, in this case, it was akin to a turtle being caught in a fishing net.<br />
<br />
<br />
I did not hear from anybody using those being banned in this wave.<br />
Of course not. Those guys would not go to MMO fansites like MMO-Champion to complain about being banned for botting or malicious hacking. They have their own forums for that.<br />
<br />
<br />
I do use that, and i wasn't banned either.<br />
I hope I'm reading this wrong, but did you just admit to botting or doing other malicious hacking?<br />
<br />
<br />
You can not increase your character speed either as the position of your character is taken up serverside ever since some assholes used noggit back in the day to alternate the map-file to run underneath the Battleground. Botting is also done differently and why &quot;Fly in no-fly areas&quot; doesn't work is the same reason why the speed increase doesn't.<br />
Well, they must've found a way, because, back in Legion, before flight was enabled, I did see a bot character actually &quot;flying&quot;. They harvested the node, mounted up on a flight mount, and they &quot;flied.&quot;<br />
<br />
The reason why I put it quotation marks was because it wasn't actually flight, but more &quot;stutter-step rubber-banding&quot;, the character going straight up, then straight forward to another direction, with the mount always playing its standing idle animation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't be a smug asshole.<br />

Except those that were unbanned and given &quot;a stern warning&quot; weren't the &quot;hackers&quot; Blizzard was actually looking for.

that is not what i understand from the post<br />
<br />
&quot;As a result, we have REVERSED all of the suspensions issued in this action.<br />
<br />
The use of third party software that modifies the World of Warcraft game client is against our Terms of Service. We expect players to remove such third party software, or their accounts will be subject to further action. Any future use of software that bypasses the security of the game client, regardless of intention or gameplay advantage, will be detected and sanctioned with increased penalties.&quot;<br />

to me it's : we reversed the sanction and hope you get rid of your third party program. if we do catch you with it again you will get hit harder than you should been this time.<br />

WoW really needs to step its game up already. We're only just now getting the option to hide items, almost a decade after the transmogrification feature is even released...what gives? Why did we stop getting new hairstyles, too? A lot of the allied races just feel like what should be extra customization options.<br />
<br />
&quot;People only mod your game if its bad&quot;<br />
Skyrim, doom, monster hunter world, terraria, minecraft, starbound, stardew valley, roller coaster tycoon, arma, binding of isaac, dont starve and dont starve together, factorio, fallout 1-4, garry's mod, half life 1 and 2, orcs must die 1 and 2, payday 2, natural selection 2, civ 1-6.<br />
<br />
All games i have on my steam/pc that i personally love, and are seen by many as bloody fucking amazing games (most not all... Lookinjg at you fallout 4)<br />
yet they ALL have mods...<br />
<br />
mods ADD to things, it does not mean that thing was not enough in the first place...<br />
<br />
you cant possibly look at wow and go &quot;wow blizzard, your just so bad we had to mod... Not allowing us to give our draenei massive breasts and a 20 inch dongle&quot;<br />
yeah... The customization does need to get better.<br />
<br />
also we have gotten new hairdos like... once... so idk why your asking why we have stopped getting more.<br />
<br />
also we have been able to hide helmet, cape, and shoulders for a fair bit now my dude...<br />

that is not what i understand from the post<br />
<br />
&quot;As a result, we have REVERSED all of the suspensions issued in this action.<br />
<br />
The use of third party software that modifies the World of Warcraft game client is against our Terms of Service. We expect players to remove such third party software, or their accounts will be subject to further action. Any future use of software that bypasses the security of the game client, regardless of intention or gameplay advantage, will be detected and sanctioned with increased penalties.&quot;<br />
<br />
to me it's : we reversed the sanction and hope you get rid of your third party program. if we do catch you with it again you will get hit harder than you should been this time.<br />
<br />
if i'm wrong and that dudes who did completly broke the game with the program got banned then it's okay then<br />
<br />
Yes, the botters and such got banned, but those who model edited got their bans reversed and will be banned if they keep them.</div></div><hr />

And yes no shit there are hiding certain slots, but the fact that it's taken this long to be able to make things like chest armor and gloves invisible is absurd. This kind of laid-back attitude of &quot;ehh, I dunno, they only did hairstyles once and we were already able to hide a few slots&quot; is exactly why we get so little from WoW to begin with, because the developers have grown (figuratively) fat and lazy on their throne while people who expect not even a minimum from Blizzard continue to enable them.<br />
Why do you think we didn't get any new hairstyles after that batch in WotLK when we got the barber? Have you questioned why, or are you just going to accept that Blizzard doesn't give a shit about letting players have any level of customization, which was exactly my point to begin with?<br />

c....cause they did... simple as that my dude.Congrats, then, you admit you paid no attention to a post you're attempting to refute. What was even your point of replying to me? <br />
And who the hell said anything about an infernal mount? I'm talking about something extremely broad like customization options, not a specific thing that a niche group of players would be interested in. You can't just compare two entirely different criticisms of Blizzard unless you're just trying to say that nobody should criticize or expect anything of Blizzard beyond the bare minimum. <br />
<br />
But for that point, no, that's not at all what I mean. You extrapolated a lot from that statement. Let me write it down in a clear way so you don't make a dunce out of yourself by making even more assumptions based on a single sentence.<br />
<br />
I'm not justifying mod use, because I don't personally agree with mod usage. However I can't exactly blame them when there are so many massive gaps in character options to begin with. WoW's customization options are intentionally pitifully low to the degree that we're only just now getting an option to hide armor slots like gloves, chest, and bracers when there's absolutely no reason this should have taken 7 years into the game's length to implement.<br />
And I'm not pointing these out for just complaining. I'm pointing out that this discussion about using mods is a great stepping off point to point out how pitiful the game's customization is. I don't want mods, but what I would definitely like is if Blizzard stopped neglecting the absolutely massive amount of the playerbase who wants more cosmetic stuff beyond a 700th mount reskin.<br />
<br />
To prove my point, there are several hairstyles available and fully functional to players in the game files that have no problems whatsoever that are mysteriously not on the barber shop. Why? Who the hell knows, there are even NPCs in new BfA zones wearing some of these hairstyles and yet we can't use them on our own characters. <br />
<br />
<br />
also because 99% of the playerbase never sees their hairstyle.You'd be right if you weren't, well, completely and totally wrong. The majority of the playerbase hides their helmets or uses non-hair covering helmets on their characters on virtually every server I've ever been on.<br />
<br />
Do you seriously believe that or are you just making arguments for the sake of some kind of meaningless point? Your posts seem like just a stream of consciousness.</div></div><hr />

there is also alot of clipping problems with pretty much all hair styles and pretty much all helms a active modding community could easily fix those things.<br />
As blizzard most likely wont do it granted there will be tig ol bitties and other weird mods only used by REALLY small amount of people.<br />
I think that it would overall be better for the game to allow the players to further customize there characters.<br />
<br />
Naturally things like terrain and world objects should not be allowed to be edited as someone who used to play around with models and such Player models and textures.<br />
Are placed in a completely different area of the game compared to world objects and terrain i just don't see why those things would not be allowed to be edited.<br />

Im actually not sure about the interaction-range. But like i said, the resizing of both the flag and the node can certainly be done. It certainly worked in BC because thats how a lot of assholes did grind netherwing-reputation till they got whooped. 3miles tall eggs are easy to find at least.<br />
<br />
However you are kind of wrong with everything else here tho, no offense. No, these guys would not go here, but go to mmowned or ownedcore these days or can be found on places like the WOWMV's Discord and similar sides focussing on Machinimacreation. Also reading helps; No, i did not do any &quot;botting&quot; or &quot;malicious hacking&quot;. But i use evermorph and used tmorph before because im kind of done staring at the same character for over a decade but a race change is not viable due to racials, so there is that. I also used self-made skins to recolor the utter mess that were T-Sets during Wrath before transmogging was a thing. My account, however, stands strong and unaffected since EU-Release, as it should. <br />
<br />
Also, i kind of don't really believe this could have happened during Legion, are you sure you are not remembering that wrong? Because the same kind of fix was implemented somewhere in Cataclysm, then extended upon during Pandaria which is also why you no longer can get under the map as easy as you could before... I think there was something in Draenor but that was short lived? And it also did not have anything to do with flying, but made the disconnect-thing that is another safety method to prevent you from getting where you should not be not work. <br />
<br />
Also for fuck sake spare me the CThun exploit. Half of the people commenting here were barely sentient when that was a thing. Yea, replacing inworld items with another worked and it did with heavy manipulation till late Wrath, but then they changed the way their entire system worked. You can also see that this video is way pre-cataclysm just by how orgrimmars gates look.<br />
<br />
Im not going to argue to defend hackers and botters. I am fairly irritated by that myself when i see 7 druid-cats running through Tiri... Tirisgardesund? ... The Boralus-Area, all in one place with like 0,1 seconds delay and farm all the fucking shrubbery away before i even see them. But you don't ban your fans when all they do is customization or machinimas. That's kind of a group of people selling your shitty game and probably the guys you want to keep if they don't hurt anybody because they tend to be very devoted.</div></div><hr />

I’ve used ahk in the past. With key presser apps and keyboard macro software, the only impact it has is you kill mobs (albeit a lot slower) by holding down 1 button. It has zero impact on the game or anyone else, other than you carrying their way below par dps. I stopped because it feels silly and gets boring and slows your questing down rather than speed it up. I also did my research first and found a gm reply saying ahk isn’t against ToS. I’m sure technically it is, but one gm reply was enough defense for me to try it.<br />

I mean, really looked, as if honestly interested about that? It's not like those guys actually advertise their mods and put adds in MMO fansites. I mean, I played Skyrim for almost a year before I finally found out about the Skyrim modding community when stumbled upon a Skyrim mod video on YouTube.<br />
<br />
By the way: I have never seen someone make a botting mod for WoW either, but I do know those bots exist, since I've seen bots working in WoW back in the day. You not seeing those hack mods being made does not mean they do not exist.<br />
<br />
<br />
Guess why those guys who use this launcher got caught in the ban-wave? It's highly likely because their launcher was doing the same thing (i.e. &quot;injecting code&quot;), or similar enough, to what the more harmful hack mods do. If it wasn't doing that, it wouldn't have caught.<br />
<br />
I mean, a turtle can be caught in a fishing net. Does that mean turtles are fish?<br />
<br />
<br />
Those that used the hack launcher simply to alter their characters' looks in ways that do not harm the game were quickly unbanned, since they were not doing any &quot;botting/automation&quot;. But that does not mean they did not break the ToS.<br />
<br />
Talking out of your ass for the sake of arguing with me, you got nothing better to do, do you ? <br />
How about this, you actually use fucking Google and see for yourself if those &quot;exploit&quot; mods exist and that they were made with Arctium in mind, get back to me after ok ? i'll ignore the whole botting thing because that's the dumbest thing that I've read in a while<br />
<br />

<br />
They have already stated their rationale for not permabanning. They found that with permabans, people will just say fuck it and make a new account which they will just exploit/bot again with anyway. <br />
<br />
With temporary bans, people are much less likely to make a new account simply because they will get access back to their old account in a relatively short timeframe anyway. There is no feeling of 'gameover' which they would get if their account was completely closed off.</div></div><hr />

Texture edits are very much not harmless, you can make the stealth bump texture bright orange for example.<br />
or mining nodes bright pink to make them much easier to see<br />
Imagine the load times of when changing from world to PVP having to switch all the textures, im sure some people would enter areanas with thier healer already dead.<br />
lol you want MORE on the store?<br />
there is alot of legal issues with getting stuff the community makes and putting it in the game, with stuff like TF2 i beleive they get a small cut.<br />
but if its free in wow, then what?<br />

I already explained that the launcher interfered with the Warden protection in order to work which again you seem to have no idea what the fuck that is...<br />
Tos...Tos...did it seem like Blizzard enforced it ? everyone got fucking unbanned, so no.<br />
<br />
Yes, they have done ban waves of this in vanilla, wotlk, and wod.</div></div><hr />

This is so deliciously ironic considering your very next sentence:<br />
<br />
<br />
How about this, you actually use fucking Google and see for yourself if those &quot;exploit&quot; mods exist and that they were made with Arctium in mind, get back to me after ok ?<br />
How about you quote me when I said that those mods &quot;were made with Arctium in mind&quot;? Considering I even said, and you quoted: &quot;It's highly likely because their launcher was doing the same thing (i.e. &quot;injecting code&quot;), or similar enough, to what the more harmful hack mods do.&quot;<br />
<br />
And yes. Blizzard does enforce their ToS. Remember the whole &quot;Preach got banned for using an exploit&quot; discussion?<br />

Also, i kind of don't really believe this could have happened during Legion, are you sure you are not remembering that wrong? Because the same kind of fix was implemented somewhere in Cataclysm, then extended upon during Pandaria which is also why you no longer can get under the map as easy as you could before... I think there was something in Draenor but that was short lived? And it also did not have anything to do with flying, but made the disconnect-thing that is another safety method to prevent you from getting where you should not be not work.<br />
Yes, it was during Legion. I remember because I've never seen a bot before, it stuck with me: Azsuna, just west of the Blue Dragon area, south of the area with all the cats. There was a mining node and as I approached it, I noticed someone falling down right onto it. He mined the node, then summoned a flying mount. From there is literally went straight up. But it wasn't &quot;flying&quot;, it was like it was constantly &quot;respawning&quot; just a little higher, gaining altitude that way, before turning around and &quot;flying&quot; straight away, in that same manner, as if it was constantly &quot;respawning&quot; just a little bit ahead. The mount, as well, was always playing its standing idle animation, not the flight animation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also for fuck sake spare me the CThun exploit. Half of the people commenting here were barely sentient when that was a thing.<br />
How about you tone it down? I never even mentioned C'Thun. I was talking about wall-hacking to get to safe areas in BGs.</div></div><hr />

Yea, replacing inworld items with another worked and it did with heavy manipulation till late Wrath, but then they changed the way their entire system worked. You can also see that this video is way pre-cataclysm just by how orgrimmars gates look.<br />
<br />
Im not going to argue to defend hackers and botters. I am fairly irritated by that myself when i see 7 druid-cats running through Tiri... Tirisgardesund? ... The Boralus-Area, all in one place with like 0,1 seconds delay and farm all the fucking shrubbery away before i even see them. But you don't ban your fans when all they do is customization or machinimas. That's kind of a group of people selling your shitty game and probably the guys you want to keep if they don't hurt anybody because they tend to be very devoted.<br />

so nah, we arnt gunna ignore the biggest possible exploit ever of what this whole thread is about.<br />

So report them, and they will eventually be banned. <br />
also idk if you know, but the injection method used to get these custom textures ingame is the same that was used for bot injecting, why they were banned for &quot;botting/third party&quot;<br />

Indeed. Not like some random people getting unbanned affects them lol.<br />

They haven't always permabanned at any point in WoW. So your attempt to try the usual &quot;HURR NEW BLIZAARD IS CHANGED&quot; is pointless.<br />

You shouldn't dictate where people get their &quot;exotic entertainment&quot;, and if they mod a game to show huge tits, only in their client, they should be able to do that.<br />

LOL. I gave up fighting that fight years ago. Some guys just need bewbs 24/7. Hey, someone has to have arrested development. <br />
<br />
But I like this reversal. I think Ion may be getting emails from the top, along the lines of &quot;Dude, that's a bit harsh for sloot mods - and do I need to remind you we're fighting to retain subs here?.&quot; Someone at Blizzard seems to be calling out the decisions, and that's great, whether it's Brack, the new producer, Ion, whoever. It's a good direction. <br />
<br />
It's a good sign they're willing to reverse bad decisions, like this, and the portals. The WoW devs have oddly dug their heels into the sand on some issues in the past, nice to see someone is keeping that from happening,<br />

It's unfortunate that those just wanting anime tiddies on their character are lumped in with those that exploit for tactical advantage. If Blizzard has the ability to discern between the two, they should just allow it.Well (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/character-model-controversy/160993/417), actually, they could have done it in some way “officially (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_cannabis)”. If it's possible to create mods, then it's possible to include &quot;allowed content&quot; in client and make it available for editing by everyone (not through client itself, of course, but through some official &quot;sources&quot;), which means to make it &quot;visible for anyone&quot;. Community will eventually complement base as some of them get official &quot;approval&quot;. That will allow them, quite consciously, without any moral remorse of conscience, officially ban those who “impatient in waiting for approval, disagree with it or really are abusing system”.<br />
<br />
...what will turn this &quot;mod&quot; into something more legal and controllable from security point of view (in fact, no longer being a mod), since it doesn't violate &quot;moral&quot; component (doesn't carry abuse of system's imperfection in order to gain game advantage)... or does? (https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17616976021?page=21#post-404)<br />
<br />
I don't in any way justify even those people who change just some kind of custom &quot;non-essential&quot; elements. No-no-no. And most of you even know why, don't you? (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1556655-Female-Draenei-Model-Old-vs-New?p=33524767&amp;viewfull=1#post33524767) I'm against breaking rules, and I think that law should, no! must apply equally to everyone. But laws in some places aren't perfect, which sometimes leads to similar moral confrontations, it's probably necessary for them to group culprits (http://www.darklegacycomics.com/676) more successfully in connection with their main signs here, which means that these &quot;signs&quot; require more tangible designation (law doesn't change here, just being specified, and therefore continues to be fully relevant and working). So why not try to make it more civilized. Naturally, it won't be everything to be “approving” from stylistic point of view, but what will get “approval” can be used without fear and for your own pleasure - fully and effectively. It turns out such mutual concession without confrontation: devs agree to “legalize (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbidden_fruit)” what doesn't go beyond of what is permissible, and players agree that they won't do it “secretly (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactance_(psychology))”, which, in violation event, doesn't entail negative consequences (devs won't have any moral remorse (https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/character-model-bans-discussion-same-as-we-had-for-xp-abuse-not-breaking-rules/46699/250) about excessive power abuse during law application, and players won't (https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/character-model-bans-discussion-same-as-we-had-for-xp-abuse-not-breaking-rules/46699) shame them for &quot;excessive cruelty together with passive own inaction to resolve conflicts of interest&quot;). Otherwise, everything must follow the law without exception, which means that “partial” un-ban directly isn't eligible here (there're no extenuating circumstances, but surely there is mention about &quot;on their discretion&quot;, which isn't very similar to &quot;legislative&quot; formulation; I don’t have their contract before my eyes, because game client has been removed along with battle.net something like 4 years ago already, correct me if I'm mistaken).<br />
<br />
ps. I repeat. I'm generally against any addons - any unofficial &quot;software&quot;, because in one way or another it affects gameplay (and for me control over character model appearance is quite objectively integral part of this process), and even if look at phenomenon more widely (I'm about excessive modern player's &quot;third-party software&quot; dependence during encounters (both in PvP&amp;PvE), absence of which in their success would give real their exclusive skills' indicator and clearly slow down content consumption speed and requirements in its complexity (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2452106-All-these-difficulties-Right-or-wrong?p=50538110&amp;viewfull=1#post50538110))... but if consider this issue in principle...:confused:</div></div><hr />

If that sort of nonsensical zero tolerance policy was smart idea, we'd prosecute jaywalkers the same as mass murderers. Maybe that explains pretty well why it's beyond dumb. Severity is a thing in the society, despite you wanting to throw death penalty at every insignificant act that happens to be against a law. Don't be shocked when people view the game rules much the same way. Afterall, it's something everyone has grown up with, while those zero tolerance fantasies are quite alien.</div></div><hr />

I also did my research first and found a gm reply saying ahk isn’t against ToS. I’m sure technically it is, but one gm reply was enough defense for me to try it.<br />

The way I understand it, they’re mainly used by disabled players to quest / lfr.<br />

You can use autoclickers by setting timers or using pixel-search features to trigger key presses based on Weak Auras, etc. You're not playing your character at that point except to move and the clicker could react faster than any human possibly could. I don't doubt that they're invaluable to some players with limited hand function and I've no idea if Blizz have ever carried out an AHK related ban wave in WoW but this software can definitely be used in ways that constitute cheating. Here's an OW player complaining that they got rumbled using it to fix a dodgy mouse and banned, so Blizz clearly know how to spot it:<br />

<br />
Absolutely not. This would be pure madness, because this would require a massive amount of bandwidth and would cause massive load times for the player.<br />
<br />
Basically every model (like player characters, npcs), every effect, audio, textures, terrain, every phase, strings (they don't need to, but they still do 99% of the time), quests (they don't need to, but they still do 99% of the time), loading screen etc. is stored on your computer (hence why WoW is 50GB+).<br />
<br />
The server is more or less the &quot;brain&quot; of this game.<br />
<br />
For example the client will request from the server a character list, so the server will find all characters associated with your account and with the realm you're currently on, then it'll send specific instructions to the client, like load a human character with face option 1 skin color 3 facial hair 1 head-id: 123456 necklace-id: 1337 etc... And the same thing will work with loading maps, buildings and so on. The server will never send you the actual 3D human model with all your gear on.<br />
<br />
btw. basically every MMORPG works like that and this is just amazing. You can play WoW without any issues through a mobile hotspot, because of the low amount of data it actually downloads (and uploads) and because of the low bandwidth requirements.</div></div><hr />

Allowing alteration of in game files may be a security issue. It may be entirely impossible to allow this for just the purpose of cosmetics. There may even be some internal component where Blizzard doesn't want their game streamed with content that they didn't create themselves. Very importantly, this could prevent Blizzard from making microtransactions off xmog, which may hurt their bottom line. There may be very good reasons why this is the way it is.<br />
<br />
However, all things being equal, it would be nice to be able to mod character sounds and character models on just a local machine(other players would see the original content). Perhaps they could add this ability in the future. I've always wanted to change some of the sounds in game to something more tactile.<br />

Not banned though, and even Blizzard agrees, they said &quot;warning&quot; for this specific issue.<br />
<br />
What I responded to was specifically YOU and the way you were happy this happened. Here it is once again:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is what annoys me far more than Blizzard's actions. It's people that judge others to be &quot;lame&quot; for wanting games to be the same as they were 10-15 years ago, and being OK with prudish corporate censoring of women bodies. And we all know why some feel like this - you think that it's objectification, and it has negative consequences in real life, and people you clearly dislike should not be allowed to objectify women bodies and draw any amount of satisfaction/pleasure from this, even in the virtual realm of gaming. This is the core of the issue.<br />
<br />
And I'm not happy with it at all. Let me explain why.<br />
<br />
First, yes, I am a hetero white male. I've been playing computer games since the 90s. I've always chosen to play as female in each RPG that offered me the option, not for some pr0n related purpose, I know very well there are much better places to masturbate on the web. I've been playing as female because of a few reasons, first, I am not identifying with the broad shouldered ugly brutes that pass as &quot;men&quot; in games, I am rather tall, athletic and lean, long years of basketball training shaped. Second, because I love the female form and would rather prefer I spend the 40 hours of my adventure looking at a beautiful female, instead of a boring male. <br />
<br />
This never had an impact on my relationships. Virtual means virtual, it's an escape from the real world. Only somebody that is mentally deficient would not see the difference. <br />
<br />
And yes, I know this has went into far more detail than the original topic matter. But I have seen enough of these arguments to know exactly who makes them and why. If we don't address the ROOT CAUSE from which all of these cases emerge, we will never get to the bottom of it. And the root cause is the people that are obsessed with female objectification, and have a deep seated dislike of heterosexuality, especially in males.<br />
<br />
It doesn't really matter what your opinion is. They deemed it to be a security risk and temporarily banned the people that were using the addon that was creating a risk. It is hilarious that your justification for why you should be able to use these addons is that you're an attractive straight male.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sil3ntearth</div><div class="date">2019-04-29, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am no longer playing WoW, since 2017, and never endangered my account with such foolishness as a raid leader and top 50 guild officer, although I always used female characters even in WoW, even as a troll. Good try though. I am specifically preoccupied by the social aspect, i.e. the way people that like to look at beautiful females in games are reprimanded, laughed and scoffed at. <br />
<br />
Also there was no such thing as &quot;justifying&quot; anything for me, since d'oh, I don't play WoW anymore. This issue is far more important than just WoW and affects gaming in general. I am glad that you associate tall/lean basketball player types with attractiveness though, I agree with that assessment.<br />
<br />
You don't have to still be playing to justify it.<br />

That's the excuse, sure.<br />
<br />
But it also did things like making hidden items giant sized so they were easier to find (achieves, rep farm), made resources nodes giant sized (herbs, ore), let people see through walls in PVP, and players giant sized in PVP so they were easier to click on. Many more that are too numerous to list here.<br />
<br />
Every been looking for tiny collectible items and thought &quot;how do people even find these to put up coordinates the first minute the patch is live?&quot; and the answer is by mods like this one.<br />

Regardless of your point of view on whether people should be allowed to use tmorph and similar things, it does seem a bit shitty to tolerate that people use it for over a decade before randomly just banning outright for 6 months with no warning at all. <br />
<br />
A warning, rather than a ban, is the way to go. If people want to continue using these things after the warning, then by all means ramp it up to a ban. But this random zero tolerance ban after years upon years of allowing people to use it was a little heavy handed :)<br />

Based on my reading, tmorph hasn't worked since legion and the people pushing it as an excuse are just mad that they got caught botting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Tmorph&quot; is just a general term I'm using because I know people generally know what that is.<br />
<br />
You're right, in that midway through Legion they changed the way the gamefiles work client side to make traditional tmorph as it existed since WotLK no longer functional. However it was since replaced by other methods of achieving the same thing.<br />
<br />
There are several online communities you can find in Google dedicated to skinning mods, model swaps and texture replacements for WoW. Old school &quot;tmorph&quot; is dead but people are still doing the same thing, for aesthetics not for botting.</div></div><hr />

I don't doubt that they're invaluable to some players with limited hand function and I've no idea if Blizz have ever carried out an AHK related ban wave in WoW but this software can definitely be used in ways that constitute cheating. Here's an OW player complaining that they got rumbled using it to fix a dodgy mouse and banned, so Blizz clearly know how to spot it:<br />

<br />
Setting timers between macro’d keypressers won’t do anything to perform a specific rotation ... it just hits the buttons it’s told to in a specific sequence. Since all rotations work on procs and complicated cooldowns which shuffles the rotation to never just be “244542” ... to even twice in a row ever, along with triggering trinkets etc. it’s never going to be even remotely worth a shit in actual raiding, m+ or pvp. <br />
<br />
As for pixel detection, like detecting which weak auras or tell-me-when or whatever suggestion a rotation optimizer addon is kicking up, there is no fucking way any keypresser could ever do that. That’s some seriously corrupt other 3rd party software which will almost certainly be on blizzards big no-no list.<br />
<br />
Again, in my opinion, ahk / macro software may be specified as against tos, or maybe in some weird grey area, but it certainly gives you zero advantage in game unless you are too physically disabled to even pull of the rudimentary of basic rotations to kill standard world mobs, in which case it would be a damn low blow to ban them.<br />

They still don't permaban for botting anymore, unless you've already been suspended a few times for it.<br />
<br />
Something about if you ban people they just get disgruntled and make another account, but if you suspend they're more likely to come back and play clean, and honestly I've seen a lot of that. We had a few people who got their main accounts suspend for 6 months for fish botting and came back and stopped doing it after that.</div></div><hr />

Incorrect.<br />
<br />
It's their game and they can enforce their ToS as they see fit within the limitations of the game. You're not considering their reputation. They may not want nude mods impacting the reputation of the game.<br />

AHK can be used in a way that is totally fine but it absolutely can screen read and capture pixel data and essentially run the 'perfect rotation' for you.<br />
<br />
In the thread I linked to where the OW player complains about getting banned they later concede that they've discovered others were using an AHK aimbot and they link to an OW forum thread about it.<br />
<br />
Here's the mod of a macro-building community site (I thought that stuff had disappeared long ago but apparently not) talking about how the use of AHK and Punchkey can cross over into botting:<br />
https://wowlazymacros.com/forums/topic/bots-botting-and-the-thin-grey-line/<br />
<br />
Here's an AHK forum thread where someone is looking for help to optimise a pixel detection script that they're using for WoW to allow them to just mash one button over and over to carry out their rotation. It's doing a pixel search presumably based on WAs (or similar) and working through a priority list so that whenever they hit 'e' it uses the correct ability.<br />

Here's a thread about a Wildstar streamer who got banned for using AHK in this way:<br />

It could give you a huge advantage if you are willing to configure it correctly. I'd be very surprised if you weren't looking at a perma-ban for getting caught doing that though and it's clear from the OW case that they can detect it.</div></div><hr />

1. Everyone knows lazymacro’s. I’ve tried them for the hell of it. None of those macro’s even come close to doing satisfactory, never mind optimal, dps. I’ve tried them over the years on just about every spec and class. Use them if your guild is happy carrying your grey parses.<br />
<br />
2. AHK pixel scanning. I stand corrected. Had no idea ahk could do that. That’s pretty ban worthy right there. I wonder how effective it is. Must use a metric fuckton of processing power if it scans your entire screen for a specific pixel configuration.</div></div><hr />

If I upload a video showing one of those mods and a parent see they might prohibit their children of playing the game, thus affecting Blizzard's business. Even if things are client-side, they can still affect the image of the game.</div></div><hr />

I think Blizz are doing a good enough job of that as is and anyway isnt the game rated T for teen? if a child younger than teenage years they shouldnt be playing the game to begin with.</div></div><hr />

I'm glad they reversed the bans but I was one of the affected 180 days people and was already bored so I don't think I'll be playing until next xpac again. /2c</div></div><hr />
