Druids changes in latest PTR build<br />
It seems that Remove Curse is now usable in Tree of Life form for Druids in the latest PTR build.<br />
<br />
Mages : Ice Block trainable<br />
Ice block will be trainable in the future, but the change might not be included in the 2.3 patch. Also, the change made to hypothermia in the latest PTR Build is confirmed. Mana issues in long fight will also be looked at.<br />
It's a deliberate change. We initially felt like it was too quick at 30s and decided to test it out at 45s, but after playing with it for a while we felt like it opened mages to focus fire a little too much so we decided to keep it at 30s. It's worth pointing out that making changes like this and later un-doing them is not at all uncommon, it's just most of you generally don't see that process in action since it often happens before the patch even gets to the PTR.<br />
<br />
Since I'm here, I'll also make a small pre-emptive strike against the incoming &quot;what about other mage concerns!&quot; replies I'm about to get and say the following.<br />
<br />
Two things we'll be making improvements to in the near future (although these aren't likely to make it in on time for 2.3) are having iceblock be trainable (to make sure all mages have it as a tool for pve encounters and to open up other trees as being more viable options for pvp), and to-be-finalized improvements to mana issues in longer fights.<br />
<br />
We do plan to buff mana gems, although I don't see that as a &quot;fix&quot;, just an improvement that needs to be made regardless.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hunters : Aimed shot cast time reduced<br />
-0.5 sec on Aimed shot cast time, hurray ?<br />
In patch 2.3, aimed shot will not only reduces healing done to the target by 50% for a ten seconds, but we're also reducing the shot time by 0.5 seconds.<br />
<br />
<br />
2.4 Patch details soon<br />
Now that's a good news. For the moment the only thing we know about the 2.4 is the addition of Sunwell Isle to the game.<br />
If you want information on something soon, assuming patch 2.3 is launched next week as we announced, we should have details on patch 2.4 available in the near future. ;)<br />

As a warrior who teams up with a rogue, mages are on of our hardest enemies and now they're getting buffed. Am I the only one who thinks mages are a very, very strong arena class and few teams are missing one? =|<br />
<br />
I hope they're doing something about melee classes, or is it just me?<br />
I find it rather hard with a rogue as companion in arenas, since we don't have as much CC as many ranged classes do and additionally we're kitable. (just played vs a very good frost mage yesterday who managed to kill both of us after we killed his teammate, just by kiting us with water elemental, frost nova and blink. I was already low and was killed soon after, but my rogue companion was at full health and wasn't able to catch up to the mage at all!)</div></div><hr />

Hurray indeed. Thing I wonder about is why they don't put it down to 2 seconds even, and reduce the damage. This is indeed a buff, 0,5 sec cast time with no damage nerf. Reducing the damage and casting time even more would be the best imo :P</div></div><hr />

Brizzard intentionally wanted the aimed to be an opener but not a skill u should use infight. They fixed that with the aimed restting the swing timer on ranged weapons (wich is fine)<br />

Someone might point out that a W/R combo is not a good one. Personally I have no first hand experience, but it strikes me as a probably limited combo.<br />
<br />
Now, regarding mages. You are having problems against frost mages. They were not buffed in this patch and nothing in the blue post says they will be so, except for the (much needed) mana issue. Frost mage is the tough cookie for melee classes, particularly well played ones. But numbers show they are far from being very powerful - the 2x2 class ranks show mages as one of the weakest arena classes.<br />
<br />
The question in mage PVP is not whether they are frost, but how deep they are in the frost tree. Fire is laughable in PVP and I presume that arcane won't fare much better. With theses changes, you may start to see more arcane or fire builds, which will actually make your life easier.<br />
<br />
But it is not only IB that makes frost builds superior. The slowing abilities of the frost tree is also part of it, and the Elemental (the only way a mage can do dmg while in IB). So frost will probably remain as the best PVP tree, particular against melee, while the other trees will gain more viability.</div></div><hr />

God, looking at your post makes me drop a tear.<br />
Warriors are top in all brackets, rogues are top in 2v2 3v3 and some 5v5's, they rape in BG, arena and world pvp. If you say that blizzard hasn't cared any for melee'ers in TBC, your lying. (Seen the rogue buffs next patch?)<br />
<br />
You expect warrior and rogue, one of the combo's that got second least survivability (next after warrior warrior), to get over 1600 rating?<br />
If you want to, ofc you can continue playing that combo, but I promise you that rogue warrior will never be a good combo in this game.</div></div><hr />

Of course, there will always be class synergies which favor some combinations, but I don't think it should be this pronounced.<br />
<br />
Well, it is not only class combos, but to a certain extent class/spec combos (specially in hybrids). As you have two similarly classes (melee dmg dealing) you have a rather specialized team - that in principle will fare well against teams composed by classes that are more vulnerable to melee and badly against balanced and very badly against counter teams (imagine a dual frost mage team). Think of it as a one trick pony and your counter team is also a one trick counter pony - that doesn't mean they are OP. <br />
<br />
To the more general question, class combos are one &quot;cardinal&quot; point in team PVP. Even well balanced, pvp focused PVP games (GW) had &quot;winning combos/skills&quot; (IWAY, ...) that used particular team composition and skills to win. The winning strategies (and combos) differ along the time, in accordance to skill and game changes, but usually there are a few that prevail. That doesn't mean that if your team mimics the top one combo it will achieved the same results, as different compositions require different strategies (and according execution). Some of these strategies become so dominant that require a &quot;fix&quot; from the games designers as they resulted from &quot;exploits&quot; - unforeseen effects of class/skill/gear combination.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Switching the teammate is not an option for me, since I'm not playing with some stranger but with a valuable friend of mine. It's distressing to be at penalty for this.<br />

<br />
If you read Kalgan's comment, they are not buffing mage PVP spec (frost - that, I remind you is far from being all powerful - they do well against you, but thats about it). Trainable IB *may* make fire/arcane more viable in the arenas, and if that lessens the number of frosties, it is actually good for you, because a Fire mage with IB &lt;&lt; Deep Frost mage from a warriors POV. <br />

<br />
<br />
It is a question of perspective. And actually not true. Yes, on launch, TBC PVE had several issues regarding melee classes, but those were mostly corrected on patch 2.1. Melee dominates the end game damage (maybe even too much).<br />
Regarding PVP, warriors are considered one of the most powerful classes - rogues have &quot;mobility issues in 5v5 (whatever ...) but they are far from being the only classes with issues in 5v5 (hunters come to mind).<br />
<br />

Well, I like being a warrior and my friend like's it playing a rogue, so we won't change that just because it's a setup which has a tough time. Maybe we find some way to be successful, but currently we're even struggling to get a 1600 rating. :|<br />
<br />
<br />
Play for fun. Winning is more fun than losing, but live with it. Grow to a 3v3 team with a new class that helps to balance your current combo, so you would still be playing with your friend, but with better odds :).</div></div><hr />

2) Frost spec will still reign supreme. I wonder what talent they put there instead of Ice Block (it is a delay source so it must be something interesting).</div></div><hr />

Warriors are top in all brackets, rogues are top in 2v2 3v3 and some 5v5's, they rape in BG, arena and world pvp. If you say that blizzard hasn't cared any for melee'ers in TBC, your lying. (Seen the rogue buffs next patch?)<br />
<br />
You expect warrior and rogue, one of the combo's that got second least survivability (next after warrior warrior), to get over 1600 rating?<br />
If you want to, ofc you can continue playing that combo, but I promise you that rogue warrior will never be a good combo in this game.<br />
<br />
<br />
I didn't say they haven't cared any, I'm neither blind nor dumb (at least I hope so! :D). I've just got the impression, blizz cared more for casters. Just wanted to clarify that, I don't want to nit-pick about that.<br />
<br />
Well, it would be nice to reach somewhere over 1600, yes, although I really don't expect to get any near to 2000. You're right, for 2v2, it will never be a promising combo. But I'm playing 3v3 and 5v5 with him, too. We're not focussed on 2v2, as a matter of fact, we're playing 2v2 for practice and just 4 fun.<br />
<br />
And yep, I've seen the hemo buff and I'm very anxious to test it out with my mate. I'll be trying a deep arms specc when 2.3 hits, too.<br />
And sorry about the tear, I didn't mean to make you sad ;)<br />

All these buffs mean is that mages will get a new talent, and mana issues looked at. We are the worst off as far as mana goes, along with Spriests. <br />
Take a look here (http://bp0.blogger.com/_E99rsZgp6TE/Rx9OvLwf5eI/AAAAAAAAACU/4Fpzdsw7gJA/s1600-h/eu2v2_2007-10-24.png) and you can see warrior is #2 in 2v2, and this data is somewhat dated. Post 2.3 warriors will be #1. Look at those OP mages, 1st in the 1400s, at the bottom for serious ratings.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ephemeral</div><div class="date">2007-11-08, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, rogues are the least wanted in 5v5.<br />
second, mages do NOT have the worst mana issue, that's elemental shamans.<br />
Third, this Ice Block change will indeed ruin the PvP as many will go PoM pyro and such. The Devs changed it so it will be trainable so every specc should be viable for anything. Take a look at the shamans, druids, paladins. The only specc wanted is resto... Instead of increasing the survival chances and OP of the mages, they should take a look on the other classes and actually fix them. The 2.3 patch where everyone will get buff will just be the same as it is now. Shamans especially will be the worst PvPers because they have no Anti-cc nor a CC ability, also the totem system is crap.<br />
<br />
This is really a rash conclusion by Blizz</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please structure your posts. <br />
<br />
That said, if I wanted to be picky I *think* it is a arcane mage with tailor gear+T5 bonus. Put them both (arcane mage and elemental shammy) outputting dmg and see who runs out of &quot;fuel first&quot;. <br />
<br />
Now, POM+Pyro + IB.. the idea of AP+POM+Pyro is to one/two shot your opponent. If he is still alive (whci in TBC he will most likely will) I fail to see how IB helps the mage. It doesn't last enough to reset POM, while he is inside he can do nothing except wasting AP time. <br />
<br />
In group PVP, frost will still be preferable. The frost advantage was not limited to IB, far from it. Trainable IB won't make mages able to do anything from the IB, as it will remain as a defensive skill. It will help a lot against casters, particularly against locks, due to the DOT clearing. But having locks complaining about mages having IB is the same as frost mages complaining that warriors got spell reflect.<br />
<br />
Where I see trainable IB being quite useful is in PVE, for removing boss induced imparing effects.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ordin</div><div class="date">2007-11-08, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is pre-mature to speculate about a change in 2.4 before the patch notes even come out for it. If mages are getting trainable ice block, who knows what other changes are going to be made for the sake of pvp and pve. <br />
<br />
The mage fire tree has a pvp talent (Blazing Speed) and so does arcane (Prismatic Cloak). If Blizzard did not intend for these trees to be pvp viable, why would they have these talents in the first place?<br />
<br />
I believe that Blizzard wants every talent tree to be PvP viable. They just buffed the healing specs and I think the healing trees are all pretty solid now (though I still think shamans need some changes). Hopefully in 2.4 they will work on the damage trees they didn't get to in 2.3 (destruction warlocks, elemental shamans, fire mages, etc). Maybe in 2.5 they'll take a look at the tanking trees like (prot warriors, prot paladins), but that seems a bit unlikely and they will most likely end up being the only specs in the game that aren't pvp viable.</div></div><hr />

Many players just spec frost in pve because of the survivability which is simply that much better than the fire's survivability. Again, there still has to be a sense to spec frost when you are able to use a frostblock in the fire tree i.e..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just to correct you, if you look at ratio of players with 2000+ rating in each bracket and contrast it with the number of people playing that class you see the following (data from http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2366728261&amp;sid=1):<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors overrepresented in 2v2 and 5v5, underrepresented in 3v3.<br />

Shaman overrepresented in 5v5, underrepresented in 2v2 and 3v3.<br />
Hunter underrepresented in all brackets.<br />
<br />
From this you can see that:<br />
Priest have no reason to complain whatsoever, they are doing better than should be expected in all brackets.<br />
Hunters have good reason to complain, they have no bracket where they are strong.<br />
All other classes have at least one bracket where they are strong. Some have two, but all have at least one.<br />
<br />
In summation. There is a class that is overpowered in the Arena, it is the Priest. There is a class that is underpowered in the arena, it is the Hunter. The rest are reasonably balanced.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you had taken the time to READ the former posts, the discussion is about what's best in arena. Just because there are lack of pvp'ing hunters, it doesnt automaticly mean that hunters isn't good for anything (Tho they have their problems).<br />
<br />
Ok so there are lack of rogues in 2v2, wonder why 30% of the top teams in most battlegroups are rogues then.<br />
<br />
edit: Your saying priests are fine then!<br />
Go through the data and check how many people that are 2300+ of shadowpriest for example, inactive teams that played before 2.2 does not count.<br />
Personally I was around 2250 all the time before 2.2, dropped down to 2,1k when the dot nerf came. I play(ed) together with a affl. lock tho, relying on dots. But in the late time we would need luck to kill a resto druid, so we cba anymore, I've gone healing. Shadowpriests get nerfed and nerfed, ok their damage was abit to high, but if Blizz is going to take away so much dmg, they have to start to add survivability. Shadowpriests are WEAK, they die fast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Moonkin form can similarly cast remove and abolish poison, but you get shifted out there too. Sorry for the mistake, and I'll edit my other post too.<br />
<br />
I still don't understand why they would give tree of life one and not the other, though. Moonkin I can understand, because there's a mage parallel, but that's a pretty weak excuse too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It`s exactly how you shouldn`t look at the matter. This way all you do, is making some obvious and glaring mistakes by generalising and jumping to the conclusions. <br />
<br />
Not every class falls under the same category. Especially hybrids being a whole different tale. In their case, you could consider each spec as a single, distinct class (sort of). If we follow the right road, check what you will get:<br />
<br />
- 95% of the paladins being holy, if not more. Prot is not a PvP spec naturally, retribution hugely underrepresented and broken. <br />
- most of the druids being resto. You won`t find too many ferals and moonkins faring well.<br />
- many shamans being resto. Enhancement most likely the rarest, elemental a bit more popular. <br />
- how many of the priests up there are using the famous disc/holy mix? Shadowpriests are less represented, yet I still wouldn`t call them rare or not viable. <br />
- mages... it`s all frost. I don`t mind the iceblock getting trainable, I just do hope that frost is not getting a strong talent point in exchange, which would only make them even tougher. <br />
<br />
<br />
Hunters have some issues and I`m fairly sympathetic to the cause, yet I loathe when it is claimed their problems are the largest. Retribution for paladins and ehancement for the shamans, it`s where the list is starting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
AFAIK there is no official info.<br />
<br />
Taking into consideration the wording of Kalgan post, I do believe that IB will be &quot;free for all&quot;, that doesn't mean that it will keep the current form. <br />
<br />
There is a thread in the official forums with plenty of speculation regarding this issue and, while it is too early to tell, here it my 2c<br />
<br />
If there is a wider tree reworking, affecting several classes, it can really be anything, but wouldn't be surprised if it was Cold Snap (yes, an existing talent), or a &quot;raiding talent&quot; - like &quot;increases damage done by frostbolt against movement impairing immune targets by 5%&quot; (basically giving the useless side effect damage penalty back).<br />
<br />
In a more current scenario it would be &quot;Improved Ice Block&quot; - increases the duration of you Ice Block by 100% and makes it self dispelable.<br />
<br />
That is because I believe that the trainable IB will have a shorter duration (5 s) and may not be self removable.<br />
<br />
Frost mages may claim that they are basically getting nothing... which would be true. But I don't think that Blizz idea is giving frost mages &quot;something in return&quot; - there is no logic in so. They didn't lose anything by everyone having IB as trainable and, as it is, frost will remain the best spec for more serious PVP endeavors. This change will only improve non frost builds in PVP, to make it somewhat more viable, and also add an interesting surviving resource to PVE.</div></div><hr />
