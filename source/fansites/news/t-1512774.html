Hello, and welcome to another edition of Artcraft. I’m Chris Robinson, senior art director on World of Warcraft, and today our environment team is going to give you a look at one of the zones we’re creating for Warlords of Draenor, as well as share some insight into how we approach creating environment art. Take it away Gary!<br />
<br />
Hey, I’m Gary Platner, lead environment artist on World of Warcraft. I direct a team of artists who help create the world . . . of Warcraft. We shape the land; texture it; place the trees, rocks, and buildings; and design the “sets” where our quest team will later place the “actors.” Today we’re going to be showing you some of what's going into the creation of the Spires of Arak. This location that would later become known as Terokkar Forest, but in Draenor-terms, this zone is the home of the regal, sinister, and flighted arakkoa.<br />
<br />
One of the best parts about working on WoW for me is when we first start a new exterior zone. Creativity reigns, and almost anything goes—it’s real blue sky stuff. When we started working on Spires of Arak, we only had some basic ideas: tall rocky spires jutting out of a dense forest. So we got together to talk about what that might look like, and soon afterward, artist Jimmy Lo started making concepts.<br />
<br />
Based on these concepts, we could tell right away that this zone was going to present some unique challenges. The biggest one was how we were going to build the large spiky rocks that would give the zone its distinctive look. We had two basic methods in mind to create those spires. Some of us thought that the best way would be to make most of the rocks as 3D props instead of using our terrain editor to sculpt the landscape into tall spires. 3D props have some distinct advantages, since building a prop allows for the creation of fully 3D objects of any shape, which gives us a lot of design freedom. The downside is they tend to be difficult to blend into the landscape in a natural-looking way (see the original Blade’s Edge Mountains in Outland). They’re also much more difficult to iterate on as design needs change. If instead we used our terrain editor to create the spires, that would allow us a lot of freedom to iterate on zone layout and design without needing to fidget with large pieces of premade geometry, with the potential downside of not being able to do the concept justice.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Our design team wanted to at least give the terrain editor option a chance, so they embarked on creating a proof of concept to see how well it could work. A lot of us contributed to the Spires of Arak, but ultimately Matt Sanders (exterior level designer) and Kelli Hoover (environment artist) were tasked with creating the zone. Kelli gathered resource material and started to do some paint-overs of our concepts in order to unify a distinctive new color palette. Meanwhile, Matt created the proof of concept in our editing tools in order to test ideas for creating large spiky rocks with the exterior terrain editor.<br />
<br />
Kelli gathered a lot of reference pictures, paying special attention to color and mood. She then slightly recolored Jimmy’s concepts to model different times of day.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/may/thumb/soa05.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/may/soa05.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/may/thumb/soa06.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/may/soa06.jpg) <br />
<br />
Then Kelli moved on to testing texture ideas by creating rough and quick block-out textures, which aren’t intended to look final but help give us an idea of color and detail. We can paint these rough textures over the landscape and do various tests to help us see how they interact. We can also see how the textures change and distort as they are painted on steep mountain terrain.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/may/thumb/soa07.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/may/soa07.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/may/thumb/soa08.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/may/soa08.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/may/thumb/soa09.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/may/soa09.jpg) <br />
<br />
As you can see here, Matt and Kelli experimented with different textures and geometry in an attempt to duplicate the concepts from Jimmy.<br />
<br />
Kelli and Matt discovered that using a striated rock texture would actually work better than a simpler rock pattern, and the striations give the impression of upward movement. These linear texture shapes would also bend and stretch well over the exterior terrain creating a really unique look for the zone.<br />
<br />
Once Matt and Kelli finalized their demo zone and we agreed that everything was heading in the right direction, the real work could begin. Now the whole zone could be completed using the style and techniques that worked in the small demo zone. They’d still have to work out the look for some of the smaller subzones, though, like dense forests, beaches, and a massive thorny bramble where the Shattered Hand orcs dwell.<br />

<br />
You have a good point, but on the other hand Outland was supposed to be created from scratch. Why not make it look way more awesome than before? I can accept some variation to the landscape when the theme stays the same. But that video looked like it is all about the same old technique of creating hills again. It is really easy to do some spikes. Just keep pushing mouse on one point and the tool raises land. It is totally different video game to create many kinds of rocks, boulders, and other wildy stuff. Now it looks like somebody raised some land with a tool, tweaked it a bit, and then applied some fancy pattern. Even the pattern is repeated, not procedural, I guess. I mean, tool raised a bit tweaked land covered with repeated pattern is so last decade.<br />
<br />
Also the exploration experience is not so good, when you keep trying to figure out can you go up here or not. In Pandaria you mostly could not, as the area was a bottle. So I wanted to get somewhere but ended up humping hills because I didn't know can I climb it or not. There were not so much exploration in it than blindly humping every hill there was in the area.<br />
<br />
And the hills and paths you could climb or walk on, look so ordinary and cartoony. There was not so much of exploration in that either, as you could clearly see that yeah there is a path, just walk on it, or yeah there is relatively flat, you can walk on it. If you see a hill, it is propably too steep to climb and propably also doesn't lead to anywhere useful. Ok there has been also hills with reasonable exciting walkways, but in general if you see a hill, it is propably just a useless boring hill, raised with a tool and tweaked like all the other hills.</div></div><hr />

You are thinking Terokkar, which is represented in WoD by Talador, not Spires of Arak. There's nothing left of Spires of Arak in BC Outland.<br />

Me too. Really interested in the new models. Don't care much for the scenery, never liked Outland or TBC as a whole really.<br />

The new character models are very nice so far though.</div></div><hr />

but what i see , for me , resembles the barrens : light brown color on almost everything , a tree here and there and some flora on the ground...<br />
<br />
its amazing how quick &amp; easy it looks in the video to design a zone when you have such an advanced design tool, a brush and a click away and ppl get hyped about it rather than thinking <br />
what else is there in WOD besides new zones that takes so much time to do? and what about those x-titan programers that blizz said will join the wow team? isnt that supposed to <br />

<br />
Actually no. They can create mountains like in picture or in Skyrim. If you look at Skyrim ground it's the same as in Wow, it's a terrain grid with plopped meshes on it.<br />
<br />
Look at the mountains in Skyrim, they are meshes created and placed separately. The same method is used in Vale of Eternal Blossoms cliffs for example. You can check them out and will notice that green cliff itself is just mesh.<br />
<br />
Why Blizzard use is rarely I don't know, but they use this method and engine allows them to do so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its the same people that scream like teenage girls and smash their piggybanks as soon as Blizzard pumps out another Store item, While Blizzard leans back in their office chairs laughing their asses off.<br />
<br />
There is absolutely nothing new thats gonna shake things up a bit for the next expansion. No real exciting feature at all. Garrisons? Farm 2.0. New models? Long overdue and doesnt add any new exciting gameplay. Mythic raiding? Not the first time the setups of raiding got changed. On top of that: recycled lore, removal of flying mounts cuz you know, &quot;immersion gaise!&quot; like adding aerial dangers and obstacles is hard to implement.<br />

Also still waiting on word from Zangar Sea, the concept art for that place was amazing beyond words. Hope they haven't scrapped it completely.<br />

There is absolutely nothing new thats gonna shake things up a bit for the next expansion. No real exciting feature at all. Garrisons? Farm 2.0. New models? Long overdue and doesnt add any new exciting gameplay. Mythic raiding? Not the first time the setups of raiding got changed. On top of that: recycled lore, removal of flying mounts cuz you know, &quot;immersion gaise!&quot; like adding aerial dangers and obstacles is hard to implement.<br />

&quot;I'm not excited for something, so nobody else should be either since my OPINION is the right one&quot;.<br />
<br />
That's what I read from your post. QQ more, people will still be legitimately excited for this new expansion since, guess what, not everyone agrees with you.</div></div><hr />

I think I agree on the mesh not meshing well. If I remember correctly, some forests had some mesh that looked like there were two patterns on top of each other but looked artificial, because they didn't mix well.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
I have said before that it would be nice to get one zone that is for example one huge dungeon or something. It could be for example one huge spire with forest all over in the base, and you need to find a way up inside the spire.<br />
<br />
They did large dome like structure in water zone, but though it were large, it was not well designed. Better design would have been to have rooms and stuff going on, it is boring to get one huge dome.</div></div><hr />

The video was of the proof of concept that it can be made... but yes, the spires should be humongous in the final version.<br />
<br />
The colors were good the concept art looks like sunset and everything is tinted orange and purple.</div></div><hr />

Standing in a dense forest, seeing these spires with a society that is a sinister looming threat above you, and walking around on the ground among the outcasts is a totally different feeling than flying above and looking down on them. How is that hard to understand?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mellrod</div><div class="date">2014-05-06, 08:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it's amazing how easy blizzard makes this stuff look. I bet it requires long nights awake and all sorts of planning. I also love how their method of designing a zone is ALOT more different than what many people's assumptions have been in the past. Blizzard definitely knows what they're doing better than any of us when it comes to designing the look of their world unlike i see alot of people saying. Although everyone has their artistic tastes, I just wish people would be more open minded.<br />
<br />
Also for the less observant, those spires aren't going to be small like that in the final version for anyone wondering. If you read the article they talk about two methods - using 3D props to create spires or using the terrain editor. Basically, all you need to know is that both methods are very hard to pull off without looking weird, and the work shown here is just a test to see if the spires are possible using the terrain editor method apart from the props one. One has to assume they are testing both methods to see which one is better and more polished. I haevn't seen both methods, but after seeing a screenshot of a gross gray spire awkwardly sticking out of the ground in this zone, somewhat similar to BEM, i would go with the terrain method. I'm sure they are planning on making them alot taller though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally, I think flying above something offers a much more complete and whole perspective over the design then being limited to small bits on the ground. You call this 'sinister' I call it 'underwhelming'. I'd like it much more if there were ledges/caves that were only accessible via flight. That would add another dimension to the game. At this point though, you're either for or against flying and there's not much either side can say they haven't already said. <br />
<br />
OT: I think the zone looks decent, but I do agree with some posters that say the 'spires' are more like small hills then what the concept art reflects. I was thinking the spires would be similar in size to mountains you see in the storm peaks, or blackrock, or even mt. neverest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This isn't MoP, no early beta with hundreds of thousands of invites going out, they've said this in many interviews. Even when beta does start it'll be much smaller in scale, more like BC and Wrath betas, so odds are good you'll never get into it anyway. Learn to live with disappointment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I feel it will be very similar to the Mantid places beyond the wall in Pandaria. About the same scale ratio. I have a feeling A LOT of the zone is going to look very similar geographically to those places with the exception of the spires and the textures/atmosphere used.<br />
<br />
Which I wouldn't really mind as I like giant trees in fantasy and real life. But I'm hoping it will be slightly different. The color palette and textures almost seemed a bit like Redridge to me. Which seems a little odd and dull compared to the concept art.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The spires look pretty darn small to accomodate for the fact that you can't fly. <br />
<br />
This zone easily could have been like storm peaks, but with giant twisted spires instead of mountains, and arrakoa overlooks instead of titan buildings.<br />
<br />
But so far, it's kind of looking like... desolace, with pointy rocks jutting up. It's not a slight on how Blizzard is designing the zone; they're doing so fine. It's a grievance on how they have to restrict their development because they have to constantly remind themselves every little valley and spire will be a detriment to travel and not an accentuation like they would be if you could fly. <br />
<br />
<br />
Ever flown over Ashenvale before? Exactly.<br />
<br />
Actually you fly THROUGH ashenvale. Next to no one flies over the treetops. Funny how that works. ANd funny how that, after running through ashenvale for over half a decade, I was not too bent out of shape about being able to fly over it. <br />
<br />
And who cares; if I want to fly over ashenvale, I should be able to. If you want to scamper around on the ground you're more than welcome. That you hold yourself to the pace of how others manage their time is a personal issue, tbh.</div></div><hr />

I don't know where you get the idea that &quot;next to no one&quot; flies over the trees because it's more convenient than having to dodge a tree.</div></div><hr />

The colors of the concept art are so unique and vivid, but the green and brown is something we've seen so many times. Maybe it has to do with the lighting, plus that sky doesn't look final and once they add in an orange sky it might make the zone feel more true to the concept art. To people not happy about how small the spires are, I think that giant, menacing spires will be saved for having arakkoa buildings on them. These smaller ones are just the average ones that are too small for the arakkoa to build their cities on. If you look at the first two pictures of concept art you see that smaller spires are empty, while the giant ones have arakkoa buildings on them.</div></div><hr />

They are designed for flight, Blizzard isn't completely retarded, re-doing Azeroth for flight cost them an entire expansion, they won't be designing places without flight in mind anymore (except maybe bgs etc).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The trees in ashenvale are so far apart, and you'd waste time flying above the treetops and then back down because they're so damn tall. Plus, there's an invisible wall not too far up above the trees in ashenvale.<br />

<br />
It's BECAUSE people are using ground mounts that Blizzard had to make them small. Look at Storm Peaks, or icecrown. The mountains and topographical features are MASSIVE in those zones, because they were designed with flying in mind.<br />
<br />
Now look at somewhere like Kun'lai. Sure, it looks pretty, but the mountains are actually very small when you size them up, because you have to feasibly run around it in within four or so minutes. There's more or less one linear path around the back area of the mountains that leads you through a little valley, with a set path here or there that takes you right up the &quot;accessible&quot; parts of the mountain. The Kun'lai mountains only get truly &quot;huge&quot; when you go to the north face of them, which drop off to the ocean (again, because you can only use flying mounts to traverse that area)<br />
<br />
<br />
They are designed for flight, Blizzard isn't completely retarded, re-doing Azeroth for flight cost them an entire expansion, they won't be designing places without flight in mind anymore (except maybe bgs etc).<br />
<br />
The point is is that they didn't design them with flight in mind, as in, things weren't meant to be explored or circumvented with flight in mind, meaning everything has to be a great deal smaller so that people aren't wildly inconvenienced by every single mountain and cliff they'd have to hoof it around on foot.</div></div><hr />
