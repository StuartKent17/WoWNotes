Legion Features List Updated<br />
The features section on the Legion site (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/legion/#features) was recently updated. One (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5075-Legion-Dev-Talk-Dev-Interviews) of the Legion dev interviews mentioned an example of a feature under development to alert you when friends join a queue so you could join with them. It also talked about improving communication between multiple groups of friends. <br />
<br />
<br />
Old - as well as improved support for in-game communities<br />
New - as well as ways to make it easier to play with your friends<br />
Removed - Create social circles with friends that have shared interests, and form the perfect group to play your way.<br />
<br />

Demon Invasion Event Test June 9<br />
On Thursday, June 9, starting at 10:00 a.m. PDT, we will activate a new realm in the Legion Beta. This Beta realm will be named “Demon Invasion&quot;, and it will be dedicated to testing the pre-expansion demon invasion event with as many testers as possible for approximately 24 hours. We expect to remove the realm after 24 hours.<br />
<br />
We ask that all Beta testers please join us in focusing testing on the “Demon Invasion” realm when it is available. While you may see demon invasions on other Beta realms, testing this content requires that your character remain at level 100, so we ask that you test on the “Demon Invasion” realm only.<br />
<br />
Please direct your pre-Legion event feedback to the Beta General Discussion forum, and please direct any feedback you have about other Legion subjects to the appropriate dedicated subforum.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much! We’ll see you at the defense of Azeroth!<br />
<br />
<br />
Legion - Demon Invasion<br />
The Demon Invasion event is going to have focused testing today, here is what we already know:<br />
<br />
<br />
Several zones are going to be invaded: Tanaris, Westfall, Northern Barrens, Hillsbrad Foothills, Mulgore, and Azshara.<br />
The Wetlands and Dun Morogh also have invasions in the data, but aren't referenced by the achievement.<br />
Each invasion is a scenario entered by any Level 100-101 character that moves in to the invasion area. <br />
Each scenario has 4 steps:<br />
<br />
Defend against a general invasion at a point, such as Orgrimmar Rear Gate or Tarren Mill.<br />
Defeat two lieutenants and a commander at that point. <br />
Defeat the various invading forces marked on the map. Currently this seems to be a zone wide objective, will a fraction of a percent progress per NPC.<br />
Defeat a boss NPC at the original invasion point that requires a group.<br />
<br />
Completing the scenario rewards Stand Against the Legion (http://beta.wowdb.com/achievements/11200-stand-against-the-legion).<br />
Completing all of the invasion scenarios rewards Defender of Azeroth: Legion Invasions (http://beta.wowdb.com/achievements/11201-defender-of-azeroth-legion-invasions)<br />
You may also obtain Large Legion Chest (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/139049-large-legion-chest) and Small Legion Chest (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/139048-small-legion-chest), which contain Nethershard (http://beta.wowdb.com/currencies/1226-nethershard) and item level 685 armor (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/armor?filter-expansion=7&amp;filter-search=fel&amp;filter-ilvl-min=685&amp;filter-ilvl-max=685)<br />
Nethershard (http://beta.wowdb.com/currencies/1226-nethershard) will probably come from other sources as well, as there is a vendor that sells item level 700 neck, finger, trinket, and back items, as well as armor set transmogs.<br />

Warcraft Movie - China Box Office Update<br />
The Warcraft Movie continues to do well internationally, with Deadline posting (http://deadline.com/2016/06/warcraft-china-record-opening-box-office-imax-results-1201769124/) numbers for China:<br />
<br />
<br />
The movie had a $46 million opening day in China.<br />
This is the largest non-weekend movie opening of all time. <br />
The previous record holder was Age Of Ultron with $28.3 million.<br />
The midnight screenings accounted for $7.6 million, close to the all time record of Furious 7 ($7.9 million).<br />
IMAX pre-sales also set a new record at $8.2 million. <br />
The movie set another record by playing on 67.5% of all screens.<br />
Projections were $122 million - $152 million for the opening week in China, but the movie may do even better than that. <br />
The international total so far is around $121 million. <br />

Shaman Artifact and Order Hall Feedback<br />
I still do not like the 20 brimstone requirement as it will make me level up mining probably on my main to help get some early on as soon as I hit 110 as this is a limited reagent based on how many characters you can get to 110 with 300 mining to spawn the quest. It does not appear to spawn every day either. This is unlike other class quests which may have higher material requirements, but is not limited by time. I don't see this changing, however.<br />
We also don't really like how the Infernal Brimstone requirement is working out, so we're going to change that step of the chain to ask for 10 Blood of Sargeras instead.

Is artifact knowledge global? Used an 80 token with 10% boost on offspec artifact, only gained 80, not 88 I would on main art.<br />
Should be. Where did that 80 token come from, if you remember? (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/736612174194298880))<br />

what makes you think that he was referring to the ilvl of rewards? Possible rewards could be sets that are actually beautiful and unique for transmog, a good mount, a title, a one time tabard (Like the Argent Dawn one), a toy like Hunting memento, etc. Current rewards are LAME...</div></div><hr />

TBH the best review I saw, was one complaining about how characters like Dalaran didn't get built upon. Like, Dalaran was never referred to as a character, how about watching the movie properly before trying to review it...<br />
<br />

<br />
Yeah, I wasn't referring to the gear Ilvl. It would've been nice for some companions or titles, toys/mounts. Just gear is lame.<br />
<br />
Looks like we get 4 sets of transmog gear, it might look good, give it a chance. There's also always a chance that more stuff will be added later on.</div></div><hr />

Another reviewer said Duncan Jones could have burnt the movie budget in a parking lot. I don't even understand how someone can say something like this.<br />
Anyway I loved the movie, seen it twice in Hungary and going once more next week. I suggest you all go and watch it if you like fantasy with awesome spells (and if you're a Warcraft fan, then no excuse not to see in theaters).</div></div><hr />

Why would you assume they were remotely referring to ilvl? Pre-launch events have always provide some sort of cosmetic/vanity item. This one is just very &quot;meh&quot; in comparison to previous ones. It has nothing to do with trying to compete with your precious ilvl that will be replaced with quest greens in the first quest zone soon.</div></div><hr />

I have said that contrary to popular belief, guilds are often anti-social in that they are too often attempting to be self-contained.<br />
I think this can be a good thing, if the community actually wants it to be.</div></div><hr />

1. It will help freshly dinged players start off with Legion if they do these events right before the xpac. Saves having to farm Tanaan. Also it's 685 it's hardly something big. <br />
2. Also it's still more than the last 2 expansions have given us pre launch wise.</div></div><hr />

1) It's a new expansion. They will get new gear. This one-time event should not give rewards for that, but something special we all can enjoy and use.<br />
2) I don't care what the last two expansions have given us. I want more danger, less super restricted scripting for people that just do quests to max level and then start over on a new alt. You know, the people that don't even know what proving grounds is because they don't even do dungeons. These are the people that cry, these are the people Blizzard feel the need to babysit. Titans forbid something interrupt them while they are leveling their 45954th alt, gathering herbs or pet batteling.</div></div><hr />

How to completely underwhelm an actual Legion invasion by using scenarios and predetermined zones :( I thought such an awesome event would be difficult to screw up, but I underestimated WoW devs' ingenuity.</div></div><hr />

Considering that 685 gear would be replaced within the first few quests of legion it's hardly worth worrying over. The only thing this will even affect is the intro quests which are tuned for 680 gear.</div></div><hr />

Which is my fucking point. Give us cosmetic rewards, not gear for people to catch up! It has no place in this pre-patch event.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Looking at the Wowhead write up so far... if you want the transmog set + ring + cloak + neck piece + trinket, that's 3,850 shards.<br />
<br />
Running all six invasions (getting nethershards for each scenario, and getting shards from the small and large chests) will give a total of 1,110. So we're gonna be farming shards for a bit, even if all you want is just the transmog. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure more zones would make a difference. Besides, how many zones did the scourge invasion cover? Or the elemental?<br />
<br />
EDIT: forgot the trinkets in my calculation.</div></div><hr />

We're getting a cosmetic reward too. If you recall legion did the same thing. We got the pet and a trinket that raiders didn't have any use for, but casual players appreciated it.</div></div><hr />

With how (relatively) quick it is to grind 700 PvP gear, it seems PvP gear would be the way to go, no?</div></div><hr />

I think every ring now has Stamina + secondary stats, at least up to lvl 107 in the beta I've seen nothing else. I guess it helps increase the chance of rings you need dropping.</div></div><hr />

The Wetlands and Dun Morogh also have invasions in the data, but aren't referenced by the achievement.<br />
<br />
When the achievement listed here literally shows Dun Morogh as part of the achievement.<br />

so your saying players who reach max level, and want to play in legion, should be told &quot;go fuck yourself&quot; kk kewl<br />

Honestly, there should be demon invasions literally everywhere. This IS supposed to be the largest demon invasion ever, right? Also, they should be persistent throughout the expansion to really sell the whole &quot;largest demon invasion ever&quot; thing.<br />
<br />
mhm sure, lets have them spend another 9 months to make something, we will play for 3 weeks, then elgion will come out and it will all be gone.. kk sure, and no the demonic invasion isent the &quot;biggest invasion&quot; its the demonic invasion, broken shore, and the broken isles, also we dont even know what is going on the other islands around the broken shore, most likely demon covered</div></div><hr />
