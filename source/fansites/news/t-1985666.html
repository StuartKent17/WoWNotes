<br />
Warcraft Movie PAX East Panel<br />
Duncan Jones and Robert Kazinsky were at PAX east to talk about the Warcraft movie. They also had a short segment on Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/WarcraftMovie/videos/639360389562923/) afterwards.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kazinsky played Alliance for a long time, but switched to Horde once he started raiding hardcore. <br />
Ben Foster was interested in spell casting and the team came up with a visual and audio language for spell casting. He was really committed to getting all of the details right. <br />
There was a month long Orc camp where the actors learned how to move like seven foot tall six-hundred pound Orcs. <br />
The team went to ILM for visual effects early on, meeting with Jeff White (http://www.ilm.com/people/jeff-white/). He had moved the technology forward for the Hulk in the first Avengers movie and is a big Warcraft fan that was excited to do the movie.<br />
It took several weeks after shooting to get the first Orgrim shot with effects. Up until then the team was very nervous about how good the Orcs would look. <br />
After the team saw the first shot with Orcs, they were relieved at how great they looked and did more close up shots.<br />
The team was halfway through filming the movie before they realized Orgrim doesn't fight much in the movie. The team then just filmed a bunch of fight sequences, including one where Orgrim hits another Orc with the Doomhammer in the stomach, lifts him up above his head, and drops him into his head to knock him out.<br />
The person who came up with the Orc language for the movie is also the person who does languages for Game of Thrones and happens to be a Warcraft player. There are a few key scenes in the movie where the Orc language is used in an interesting way and where fans will recognize some of the phrases. <br />
Ramin Djawadi (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramin_Djawadi) did the Game of Thrones theme as well as music in the Warcraft movie. It is different than the Game of Thrones music, incorporating some of the Warcraft game music in some places where it made sense as well as new material. <br />
Fans of Warcraft will feel like they have gone home when they see the movie.<br />
Kazinsky plays an Orc Death Knight, he has been researching for his role for years! He didn't have to correct people on set about how the Warcraft universe worked, as everyone working on the movie did a great job. <br />
Motion capture is now good enough to show all of Orgrim's emotion. <br />
Clancy Brown rides a frostwolf in the movie. During filming he rode up on a little blue rocking horse, pulled by three crew members and that scene took a long time to film because of how funny it looked without effects. <br />
When Duncan Jones heard that the previous director had moved on, he asked to read the script. He recognized that Human heroes vs Orc villains was not the right way to do the movie. He pitched his idea to Legendary and then to Blizzard, showing heroes on both sides, half Human and half Orc.<br />
The audience spends a good amount of time with the Orcs, so he had to use CGI rather than latex prosthetics. To offset all of the character CGI, lots of real sets were used. <br />
In the movie Orgrim has the Doomhammer and uses it as a hammer as a Warrior, so there is a little bit of bending of how the game works.<br />
If this movie does well and Duncan Jones gets to do a sequel, he will be able to put Tauren in it. After that he could do Illidan, Arthas, and all of the other story if the movies do well. <br />
No matter when you started playing Warcraft, or even if you haven't, everyone will be able to enjoy the movie.<br />
There are moments where the movie differs from the lore in smaller ways to make it a better movie. <br />
Duncan Jones tried to fit in extra material and easter eggs that would fill out the Warcraft experience for fans in a way that wouldn't distract from the story. <br />
The team worked with Wei Wang (http://wow.gamepedia.com/Wei_Wang) to do art for the movie. <br />
There are only a few scenes in the movie where the Orcs and Humans are in the same scene. <br />

World Quest Difficulty<br />
While this will change over the course of the expansion pack as you gain power, the tuning values we're currently shooting for are:<br />
<br />
Normal World Quests: 1+ player(s)<br />
Rare World Quests (blue, no dragon): 2-3+ player(s) <br />
Rare Elite World Quests (blue, dragon): 3-5+ player(s) <br />
Epic Elite World Quests (purple, dragon): 5-10+ player(s) <br />
<br />
Some content will be easier or harder within each difficulty band, this is intended. We would like the outdoor endgame to have challenge peaks and valleys. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/409314-simple-question-for-devs-about-world-quests/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743314522?page=1#3))<br />

Order Hall Upgrade - Instant World Quest Completion<br />
I&quot;m trying to be supportive, I really am.<br />
<br />
But looking at this image from MMO showing Order Hall upgrades with an option to &quot;instantly complete&quot; a world quest just blows my mind.<br />
<br />
Wasn't this one of the biggest problems with Garrisons? Sending followers out to do things while we just clicked a garrison mission table?<br />
<br />
How is this different? Why do we need &quot;instant completion&quot; of content that is designed for us to actually egage in? Don't you see that you are neutralizing your own content again and removing the need to go out into the world and complete things?<br />
Currently this ability only works on a small amount of World Quests - those akin to a daily quest. Does not work on dungeons, rare elites, bosses, etc. <br />
<br />
With that in mind, continued feedback is welcome! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/409302-cmon-blizz-are-we-doing-this-again/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743384500?page=1#7))<br />

World Quests<br />
Will reason be provided as to why our characters will do them? Like, how do they know things are going on on the map?<br />
Quest text will be given to you via a Talking Head when you start/finish the quest, and are tied to the zone's quest story. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/720355651394805763))<br />
<br />
will the World Quests involve filling up bars, or will they have actual objectives?<br />
Both, more the latter than the former as bars tend to not tell as interesting stories as doing individual things. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/720371821661462528))<br />
<br />
Order Halls<br />
Jeremy, you're one of the few communicators so I'm reaching out. This Legion mission table scares me, despite Ion's comments.<br />
it's definitely one of those things that could be super contentious/not fun, we think it's improved, please give us feedback! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/719947952337264640))<br />

M Nythendra thread is clustered, but can you maybe change the colors of the rot pulls? Blend in a bit too well.<br />
Thanks - &quot;red-on-red-on-red&quot; concerns are definitely something that's on the radar. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/719646784469905409))<br />

<br />
The Broken Shore in the Alpha will require 20 people correct? Since it was announced 20/20. <br />
1-20 (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/720365007477673985))<br />
<br />
Is Broken Shore part of the pre-patch/event or is it the Tanaan Intro type for whenever 7.0 launches?<br />
Both. During pre-launch, it kicks off the Legion invasions. Post-launch, it sets the story for heading to new Dalaran. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/720372366870601728))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Oh, and World PvP objectives are a part of World Quests? YESSS, love it. Just hope it won't be queued or phased.<br />
.Most of them are open FFA arenas, sometimes involving riding a goat. Embrace the world PvP! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/720353265141985280))<br />
For those of us who hate PvP more than GC hated Paladins, I assume the PvP objectives are fully optional?<br />
Both PvEvP (PvE that flags you) and full PvP objectives will be available. Both grant honor. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/720355915250020352))<br />
(PvE that flags you) if it flags us for pvp it isnt a PVE objective.is it?<br />
This is an attempt at &quot;PvEvP,&quot; similar to assaulting an NPC-controlled Wintergrasp tower. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/720371061318004736))<br />
We will be monitoring feedback closely! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/720371148324605952))<br />

Reputation<br />
That's not my question. Can I complete all reputation besides the inevitable PvP one with just pure PvE quests?<br />
Yes (there is currently no PvP reputation). (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/720357269938896896))<br />

Probably Legendary/Universal team stepped in and asked her to remove due to copyright etc etc. It's so stupid - this trailer was SO much better than the previous 'wub wub' one they released last week. I really don't understand their reasoning for blocking so much 'exclusive' content. Don't they want to create more hype and excitement for everyone (not just the small amount of people that go to these conventions compared to a worldwide audience). I don't get their marketing strategy at all.</div></div><hr />

It's a game. Sets should look like the game. I wouldn't want sets to look like real life or 5th century whatever. I want to feel like I waited 8 years to see a Warcraft movie. Plus Disney's fun :D</div></div><hr />

So what? There's nothing wrong with taking good ideas so long as you're not directly ripping people off. It's just a bit of fun extras. TF2 don't have sole rights to make companion comics for their game. If the devs thought that making comics in order to deliver extra background on their characters was a good idea, then more power to them. Games have had companion comics long before TF2 did it anyway.<br />
<br />
I very much doubt they'd even hide that they were inspired by TF2s comics. There's nothing wrong with that either. If &quot;Sexton Pale&quot; showed up, you'd have a point, but he didn't, so you're just shitting for the sake of it.</div></div><hr />

&quot;There are moments where the movie differs from the lore in smaller ways to make it a better movie.&quot;<br />

Yes, Lets change some lore so we can make a &quot;so called&quot; better movie. As if that hasn't &quot;F&quot;Ed up nearly all video game to movies attempts. Stick to what hooked people in the first place. Not some garbage lore changes so they don't have to show demon blood being drank because that puts the orcs in a bad light or dalaran that shouldn't be flying but is because it looks cool. And those are just 2 off the top of my head. You can bet there are plenty more.<br />

Nah was just curious on which one you said. I remember saying you said one but tbh I doubt the movie is gonna do well despite the big budget and franchise. I hope people who want to see it enjoy it but well track record most video game movies ain't been a success. FF Spirits Within, Doom, Advent Children to name some. One I know off the top of my head that has is Resident Evil.<br />

Yes. it is an mmo. But its always a hassle getting into world boss groups. Say you are in the dungeon queue. You need to leave it to join for a kill that takes maybe 2-3 min. That sorta sucks. Instead of just joining in and go pewpew on the tag.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know why people are surprised by this. It doesn't matter if the movie will effectively treat humans and orcs on par, when it comes to talk about the movie the orcs are blatantly going to attract most of the attention, be it for the CGI and tech behind them, all the work the actors needed to interpret them and the mere fact that orcs like these were never seen by most people. About humans you can only talk about their armors and weapons, which normally ends up with someone screaming &quot;LOOKS PLASTIC&quot; and that's it.<br />

I fear this movie wont hold true to the warcraft lore fans got hooked on because they feel things had to change just for a movie or some BS &quot;oh this would look great in a movie if we change things.&quot; Some movie douche will think it doesn't matter but in reality it does. <br />

It's almost like the marketing department at Universal has read the threads here and took notes: More actual combat between orcs and humans, not just one guy, more dwarves and IRONFORGE, classical music that fits the theme, etc.<br />
<br />
Still with the glib, flippant responses from humans, and deep, philosophizing from the orcs. I still don't get the premise - they invade Azeroth for reasons, start a war to claim the land...and then want to stop a war they started...because babies. Not very orc like, if you ask me. <br />
<br />
But, as trailers go, much, much better. Now, if they can redo all the lame posters...<br />

<br />
First, like it's been said already - he plays one in the game, not the movie.<br />
<br />
The first Death Knights will be created at the end of the First War - but since the movie isn't following the game lore (They're 'escaping&quot; a dying Dreanor, not being sent by Gul'Dan to invade and conquer, and Azeroth betrayed by a comatose Medivh) who knows?</div></div><hr />

Except that the vast majority who have seen the trailers in person at PAX disagree with you. Just because you have an opinion doesn't mean that's the accepted opinion and everyone suddenly think the trailers are bad and need to be vocal about it, especially Michele Morrow.

Are you sure you're talking about the same trailer? Because this one starts off very similarly to Trailer 1 but changes half-way through. Watch them both fully and compare. It wouldn't make sense for it to be in front of movies already as it's not even publicly released yet. But if you did indeed see the PAX one in front of Huntsman though let us know.</div></div><hr />

It's the best one yet, all we've gotten is two mediocre to horrible trailers so far! WTF! It's like they want this film to fail.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unless somebody can state otherwise, I think this movie only consists of what occurred during the events of Warcraft 1, where the Orcs first invaded Azeroth. What made warcraft so popular was the progression of its story from war1 to war3 and all the books in between. I sincerely hope that the next movie does not show Tauren or Illidan (but can show Arthas when he is younger), as that would be skipping some of the most significant events in the warcraft universe and the introduction of some of the most renown heroes.</div></div><hr />

It is its own story. Originally the script was the story of Orcs VS Humans. In that original script the orcs were not good guys. They did not team up either.<br />

If you watch the first Warcraft Panel, you'll see he's a lot like us. He used to raid competitively in WOTLK and has hundreds of /played hours.<br />
<br />
<br />
He talked about how he'd post on MMOC and know Blizzard wasn't actually reading that so when he met the game devs he started ranting towards them on what they should do.</div></div><hr />

Yeah... I've seen that. Whatever he decides to do, I'm just hoping he doesn't stray too far from what made warcraft epic. Truly the orcs should be portrayed as evil in the first couple movies, with Durotan's group being the only good orcs. It's how the universe spawned awesome bad guys like Ner'zhul, and they can't reasonably do a movie with the Lich King unless they let the orcs be evil.</div></div><hr />

uh last time i checked orgrim DID use the hammer as a warrior, how is the bending the game at all? Just cause it's being used by a shaman right now?</div></div><hr />
