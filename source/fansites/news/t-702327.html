Mal'Ganis is usually ahead of Illidan although that and Blackrock occaisionally overtake it. It's usually far ahead, and was 3 weeks ago.<br />
<br />
Either way, Mal'Ganis is pretty much the center of the WoW universe. It can't be argued that any server is as influential as it. Even after the two top 100 guilds (Vigil and Juggernaut), there are guilds like Elitist Jerks and Goon Squad that are influential in the community as a whole.</div></div><hr />

Well played I must say, congrats.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't play a class that could equip this item, so I really don't know what goes into making it.<br />
<br />
Besides having a lot of gold to buy primordial saronite, and the skill to kill the two abominations which allows the shards to start dropping, then fighting a RNG battle for the shards to actually drop, what else goes into making this item that would try ones patience?</div></div><hr />

I'm going to put money on this wep to be the best till you get BWS (blackwing spire) weps or it maybe even better then those (a better wep in the next raid maybe?). <br />
<br />
The proc is exceptionally good and the 3 red sockets. When cata comes, you can change the gems to the best gems you will have at that time. Blizz does want legendaries to worn out at some point, but they have said that gear progress will be much smother, look at val'anyr (still bis for some classes, maybe all?).<br />
<br />
That said, it is indeed the most impressive legendary to date :). The quest, the amount of work to be done to get it, aswell as the lore is amazing. The proc effects make this legendary the sexiest in my book :)</div></div><hr />

Indeed it has... Worldwide there will be 25-75 of these within the next 2 days.<br />
<br />
There will be 200-300 within the next 1-2 weeks.<br />
<br />
There will be 500-600 within the next 3-4 weeks.<br />
<br />
There will be 1000+ in 6+ weeks!<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd like to know if the 270 strength bonus stacks, probably won't but would be interesting if it did.<br />
<br />
Either way, in PvE it's probably a 700-1100 DPS increase over a 277 weapon. As far as i remember Warglaives were a bigger upgrade for rogues.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mirrorzoom</div><div class="date">2010-03-17, 07:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">People here still think Mal'Ganis is the center of US PvE, the fact is that what made MG so great in WLK has already decayed over the past months. <br />
<br />
Mal'Ganis isn't carried by 2-3 guilds. Jugg, Vigil(Aurora), EJ didn't change much over the course of WotLK, however, the Mal'Ganis raiding community is made of a slew of guilds that all contributed to the wowprogress ranking. (I think wowprogress only rank the top 15 guilds from each server, not exactly sure.)<br />
<br />
At its peak during Ulduar, Mal'Ganis had 13 world top 500 guilds. Out of the 800 servers out there, most servers would be lucky to have one. Even in ToGC, Mal'Ganis had 11 top 500 guilds. Now, Mal'Ganis have 5 top 500 guilds. <br />
<br />
You constantly hear about the latency problem on Mal'Ganis, it has halt lots of guilds' progression. Recruitment is also a huge issue. Transfers comes in and out of MG everyday, but the vast majority of them doesn't qualify for progression content raiding. The result is those on top of the food chain, Jugg and Vigil gets to pick their app first, while the rest of the guilds would have to settle for leftovers. EJ is a special case because they have their own player network so they usually don't have recruitment problem. <br />
<br />
After ToGC, a few of the top MG guilds transferred off due to latency problems. At the start of ICC, several guilds broke down due to lack of progression. Not only has Mal'Ganis alliance raiding guilds completely vanished, even the horde guilds that has been around since the launch of original WoW are falling behind. <br />
<br />
Jugg and Vigil will continue to dominate from the top of the food chain, but Mal'Ganis as a whole should take off the crown of pve and pass it to somebody else already.</div></div><hr />

First, if you notice my shoulders, i'm not sub 2k. Having a bad session happens to everyone.<br />
<br />
I did around 100 game as TSG with people with an MMR of around 1800, most of my games was WLP, not exactly a ''top tier comp''. And we did this team to get people shoulders. I'll probably find a new one to push for T2 or higher.<br />

<br />
First, if you notice my shoulders, i'm not sub 2k. Having a bad session happens to everyone.<br />
<br />
I did around 100 game as TSG with people with an MMR of around 1800, most of my games was WLP, not exactly a ''top tier comp''. And we did this team to get people shoulders. I'll probably find a new one to push for T2 or higher.<br />
<br />
Still it has no place in Arena, its like being given a free glad title.<br />
<br />
<br />
Um you just broke 2k for the first time in the last 3 weeks ago as tsg and you were there for a whole 3 days. The point is that at non reaching for glad range there are so many things that are at fault for losing other than a weapon with 20 higher dps and a good amount of str on it on the avg proc.<br />
<br />
The 1900-2100 proc split with every enemy in 15 yards wont be as gamebreaking, it is far less bursty as a proc then heroic bryntoll. The scarier part is how easy it will be for a warr to arp cap with this and h dbw.<br />
<br />
tl:dr no not free glad but a nice weapon for pvp nonetheless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My MMR is around 2k1 - 2k2, i'm helping people getting their shoulders, i get my helm and will probably find a new team. I play this toon seriously since mid S7, so yeah i didn't had the time to catch up and get 2k+ during S7. I'm not arguing i'm that good at all, and no Shadowmourne isn't the reason i'm currently sitting at meh rating.<br />
<br />
The procs isn't what scares me, but the amount of Strength from the proc (before it ''unleashes'', and the amount of stats on this. Have you ever played a Healer in woltk?<br />
<br />
It is free glad if the player wielding this weapon is already half decent.<br />
<br />

<br />
Why don't I buy him being the first one to get it? Number 1 being everyone is quick to assume he is the first becauce it's being reported on MMOC. Number 2, the only real way this could be authenticated would be to have someone connected to MMOC in every single (relevant) Raiding guild on every single server, which I know is impossible. Number 3, I've seen at least a dozen people on Cenarius with Shadowmourne (not including myself because my main's a Warlock). <br />
<br />
Not to say he shouldn't be congratulated, just we shouldn't be quick to say he got it first. I have no screens to prove the third point but I know what I saw, nor am I asking anyone to take what I'm saying at face value.

What are you a retard? ofc every guild has been doing the quest thingies and have a guy collecting shards, some are probably very close. This guy just happened to get all his shards first due to RNG, you know they aint 100% drop right? all wont complete it at the same time but im sure some are very close and atleast a couple more will get there shadowmourne the following week<br />
<br />
edit: also the fact that you compare getting shadows edge with shadowmourne is pretty laughable, i can get shadows edge for my fury offspec in about 1 hour if i want, just need to pay about 30k gold right now but it aint worth it imo.<br />

Really? First, there is an extremely limited pool of people who have any chance at this axe. There are fewer than 1500 guilds that have killed 25 man Lich King, and only the DKs (tank or DPS), Warriors (DPS), and Pallies (DPS) are shooting for the axe. Figure an average of five people per guild, means less than 7500 people are even in the running. Realistically, only one per guild is being given the shards, so less than 1500 people are in the running. Even more realistically, only guilds downing at least a substantial number of hard modes are likely to get the shards (the drops chance is much higher) this quickly, so we're down to maybe 500 people in the running (there are 516 guilds 8/12 Hc). <br />
<br />
You think no one would notice if some guy in one of the top 500 guilds got a world first legendary? There is no conspiracy. The axe really is not easy to get. <br />
<br />
PS: The bolds are really annoying.</div></div><hr />

This....well...uh...<br />
<br />
This is very, VERY close to the dumbest shit I have ever read on here.<br />
<br />
You DO realize what it takes to get Shadowmourne, right? Due to drop rates of Shards, it leave it COMPLETELY up to chance. Someone could &quot;work&quot; extremely hard but only get 2 out of 50 required shards in a month. Extremely unlikely, but it's the way it goes.<br />
<br />
Dozen people with Shadowmourne? Hey, you realize SHADOW'S EDGE damn-near shares the same model, just doesn't have as much glow, right?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demran</div><div class="date">2010-03-17, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok wait. Hold the fuck up. Ok this Quest Chain's been available for more than a month and so far only ONE person wanted Shadowmourne bad enough to put in the effort for it? And yet this is the first confirmed completion of the quest? I don't buy this. I don't buy this at all. Otherwise this is bullshit.<br />
<br />
Why don't I buy him being the first one to get it? Number 1 being everyone is quick to assume he is the first becauce it's being reported on MMOC. Number 2, the only real way this could be authenticated would be to have someone connected to MMOC in every single (relevant) Raiding guild on every single server, which I know is impossible. Number 3, I've seen at least a dozen people on Cenarius with Shadowmourne (not including myself because my main's a Warlock). <br />
<br />
Not to say he shouldn't be congratulated, just we shouldn't be quick to say he got it first. I have no screens to prove the third point but I know what I saw, nor am I asking anyone to take what I'm saying at face value. I mean most Server Firsts go unreported so the idea several someones have done this already shouldn't be surprising to the least.<br />

To everyone who feels the need to not just congratulate and troll on things so trivial as his name - Congratulations on high douchery, way to try and steal the moment. Sadly for you, there is no TMZ here to splash your face over the TV as the angry fat kid who didn't get it first.</div></div><hr />

Also if it is the entry lvl for cata (277), then its going to be the quality of hc 25 man entry tier, being as good as normal lvl 2nd tier gear, being viable into the 3rd tier = how muhc longer then that mace from uld? :P</div></div><hr />

Let's see... Icecrown was released December 9th.. that is 4 months ago. Months to acquire it - check.<br />
Also there's a questline to obtain blood from bosses where you need to collect 25 Primordial Saronites. On my server that equals about 30K gold. I think you could label 25 primordial saronites as mats.</div></div><hr />

The entire quest chain is &quot;flavortext&quot;. Plus, nothing put on their by the NPC's really means anything, because it's your axe for once. Yours. Not an Elemental Lord's, the last Guardian's.

<br />
<br />
The amount of fail from your comment is overwhelming. As someone as stated it has been four months since ICC was released, the materials needed are 25 or so Primordial Saronite which is expensive, along with the quest line and the difficulty of obtaining the shards as well I'd say this counts as hard. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Dk's are a worthless class. They get raped in pvp. and they suck as dps. In my opinion they are a fail excuse for a second &quot;80&quot; or main character.<br />
<br />
<br />
You've just destroyed whatever credibility you may have. DK's when played right along with the proper glyphs and talent builds like any other class provide useful buffs, can do very well in pvp, can tank well and do good dps. <br />
<br />
<br />
