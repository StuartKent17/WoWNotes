Updated Player Models<br />
We definitely want to do it. Our artists would love to - believe me. The worgen and goblin took an enormous amount of art and animation time for Cataclysm. It's definitely on the list though. We recognize the problem with old models in shiny new armor. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26137024331/blizzchat-developer-chat-on-twitter-7-16/))<br />
<br />
Will the gnome/dwarf starting area be revamped?<br />
Yes. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26137024331/blizzchat-developer-chat-on-twitter-7-16/))<br />
<br />
Environment based spell effects<br />
is there currently any way to implement ability based environment effects? Ie, creating an obstacle in a player's path.<br />
It's technically possible, but really risky in terms of the potential for player abuse. Even in a PvE situation, it would be easy to get a mob stuck in a position where it couldn't path to targets without a ton of bullet-proofing on our part. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26137024331/blizzchat-developer-chat-on-twitter-7-16/))<br />
<br />
Spell school immune mobs<br />
I can't think of the last time we made a spell school immune mob. Do you run into them often? It's the kind of mechanic we realized was never going to work because we design classes and specializations around schools. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26137024331/blizzchat-developer-chat-on-twitter-7-16/))<br />
<br />
Duplicate answers in the Twitter Dev Chat<br />
We had the full class design team fielding questions and two community managers compiling their answers. In most cases, the developers were good about communicating with each other about which questions they'd be taking, or which classes each would focus on. It looks like roughly six questions got answered by more than one developer out of nearly 100 questions answered. In some cases, Lylirra and I accidentally double-posted the same Q&amp;A while hurrying to compile the answers -- which did not at all affect the time it took for the developers to field questions. We're going through and removing any duplicates right now (identical questions with identical answers).

Feral at LVL 10<br />
You already have cat and get bear right around the same time. Picking Feral gives you Mangle and you can get some early talents encouraging you to level as a cat. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26137024331/blizzchat-developer-chat-on-twitter-7-16/))<br />

Lack of Mage questions in the Twitter Dev Chat<br />
We didn't screen them (as far as I know). We just didn't get many. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26137024331/blizzchat-developer-chat-on-twitter-7-16/))<br />

Is there any chance to see Invisibility on other classes?<br />
Unlikely. We try not to share around unique abilities unless we feel it's absolutely necessary (like in the case of the mandatory buff scenario). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26137024331/blizzchat-developer-chat-on-twitter-7-16/))<br />

Paladin Rotations in Cataclysm<br />
We felt like we needed to add several new spells to the paladin rotation, including making Holy Wrath a real part of the rotation. With all of those changes, we thought it was hard to justify having a mechanic to choose your Judgement when you were already choosing your Seal and Aura. It's just a different model. If anything at the moment I'm worried that we made paladins too complex and might have to reign it back in a little. :) We'll see when players can try it out in beta.

Leap of Faith and CC<br />
It won't remove movement impairing effects, at least not innately. That's the kind of thing we might add as a glyph or talent, but you have to be careful about this sort of thing because then the spell would likely be used as a snare-break and not for its main purpose. Likewise, once you mess with threat, that precludes using it on some targets, and again, we don't want priest to feel like they have to use it like a Hand of Salvation instead of to actually move allies.

Frost Spells<br />

Elemental new spells<br />
Earthquake is their big addition for Cataclysm. They'll get a lot of use out of Spiritwalker's Grace as well -- they were really who we had in mind with that spell. They are also getting some new mechanics, such as Lava Surge. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26137024331/blizzchat-developer-chat-on-twitter-7-16/))<br />

Cause really, there are a LOT of UI changes with the expansion, it may be a good idea to make a category for them. :)<br />
<br />
edit: And after watching that MMO Report... really? Seriously Casey? Did you and your writers sleep past the over 1000+ news articles written that week which you could have easily seen if you had gone to news.google.com and plug in &quot;RealID&quot;? Did you miss the 40,000 post thread on WoW's own forums, every single page having at least 2 or 3 articulate arguments discussing the obvious implications and security risks about real names being put on such a huge publicly viewable forum?<br />
<br />
It's not funny to &quot;put on a big boy face&quot; and pretend that those genuine security risks aren't real. There are a lot more than 17-year-old world-be-damned white males that play MMOs these days.</div></div><hr />

How about a Frost Shield for resto? They want people to make choices when healing, you could choose between Earth Shield on your target and Frost Shield - which absorbs for a bit less than Earth Shield heals for, but also slows attackers.</div></div><hr />

Any &quot;traditional&quot; looking elemental mob is generally immune to &quot;their&quot; school. Thankfully, they didn't slip up on any boss mobs. Hopefully with Cataclysm they'll pull most of them out.</div></div><hr />

Spell school immune mobs<br />
I can't think of the last time we made a spell school immune mob. Do you run into them often? It's the kind of mechanic we realized was never going to work because we design classes and specializations around schools.

We felt like we needed to add several new spells to the paladin rotation, including making Holy Wrath a real part of the rotation. With all of those changes, we thought it was hard to justify having a mechanic to choose your Judgement when you were already choosing your Seal and Aura. It's just a different model. If anything at the moment I'm worried that we made paladins too complex and might have to reign it back in a little. We'll see when players can try it out in beta. <br />
<br />
It really sounds like it is to complex. To me the idea of holypower sounds like to much considering that the class is already mana based. And making one class extra complex while others have &quot;I win&quot; buttons does not sound great. <br />
<br />
I have already pointed out how holy power + positioning on holy paladins will automaticly limit the class - considering that all the other healing classes have a smartheal button that only requires mana managment. To me it sounds like BLizzard is doing the same thing to the other pala specs. Just making things extra complex. <br />
<br />
Mana managment + holy power managment + positioning limitations is not the way forward for Paladins. Sadly it sounds like BLizzard has already made up their minds and will push through no matter how horrible it might turn out to be.</div></div><hr />

Well think of the little kittens. Combo points + Energy + Position Requirement. I'll think you will manage just fine! If not, well it's a sad day then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In terms of holy palas - I doubt that we will be getting mana at diffrent rate than the other healing classes. Combo point system for a healing class sounds bad - specially if it involves Mana managment (not energy) and position Requirement (10 yards and cone ability). <br />
<br />
My greatest fear is that they are doing a Warrior priest (Warhammer online) with holy palas. The main diffrence there is that WPs do NOT rely on Mana but ONLY on holy power pool. So if Blizzard is adopting WAR WPs into WOW + mana managment = it will fail simply because other healing classes do ONLY have to watch mana and nothing else. Nothing! Because all their group or raidwide abilites only require mana managment. For holy palas its a 10 yard healing distance + directional healing on top of mana managment and now holy power managment. Not to mention that they also might have to watch out for threats and controlling issues (mind control, fear, bounce) that limits the class even more.<br />
<br />
Just sounds way to complex. Specially considering that those spells will probably be as mana intensive as a full smart groupheal for the other classes. <br />
<br />
But we can only hope that Blizzard is not gonna experiment this much...</div></div><hr />

No, it means they won't have that horrible 2h swing animation in the far future. Don't expect the models to change any time in Cataclysm.<br />

<br />
Problem is that holy shock has 6 sec cd so building up something that you need at X point that is unknown yet sounds bad. Combo points build up until you deside to use them at the right time to do damage. Healing doesn't work like that - you dont control when others take dmg. Holy shock is part of that emergency mecanics that holy palas had to have as a &quot;holy shit&quot;(emergency) button. It sounds bad if BLizzard is forcing holy palas to use a emergency spell spell every 6 second cd to build up another spell...that isn't even a &quot;holy shit&quot; spell cause it requires certain positioning. Cause healing is not a dmg rotation. Its based on need. Watching who needs heals + mana control is enough for the other 3 healing specs (aparently).. thats all they have to think about. So - putting up a healing rotation that involves watching what healing is needed + area threat (like all classes)+ mana pool + healing power (to use some spells) + spend every holy shock CD (not based on need) + positinal requirements based on heading and very limited distance = really doesn't sound like viable healing mecanics. <br />
<br />
Like BLizzard have already hinted... its overly complex - and what is even more important - its many times more complex than the other 3 healing classes in the game are built on. <br />
And after all - this is all about balance. What healing class to take... the one that pushes one button to heal 5-25 ppl (including raidwide smartheals)... or the one that needs to stay 10 yards from those hes healing (not smartheals) - or is forced to be turned in one direction to actually heal those that desperatly need heals. Even when he needs to run the other way to prevent dying himself. And this class can only do it IF he has built up some extra power that spends mana and uses up emergency spell that has very long cd (same as smart groupheals for other healing classes). <br />
<br />
What healing class whould you take with you ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rogues/kittens only have to make sure they're behind the enemy. When he says positioning, he's talking about how now there are healing spells for holy paladins that go out in a cone (meaning if he wants to heal the melee dps, he has to move over to them and make sure they're infront of him at the right angle), and then there's the 10y aoe spell he has to make sure all of his intended targets are in range of him (and given most fights have required the raid be spread out...).<br />
<br />
This sort of positioning isn't required for the other healing classes.<br />
<br />
Then Holy Power - which is more like Runic Power than Energy by the way, I don't know why everyone has stuck with that comparison - has to be monitored on top of mana (which Blizzard is wanting healers to be able to run out of again), all-in-all giving holy paladins double the amount of things to monitor and strategize then the other healing classes.</div></div><hr />

now THIS, is something that caught my eye, just leveled a shaman, as elemental, and from what i saw, all the elementals in nagrand (and there are alot of em) were immune to lightning, to get some of my quests needed some items from them, so i had to spend alot of time, kiting them with frost/flame shock and kill them with a searing totem :(</div></div><hr />
