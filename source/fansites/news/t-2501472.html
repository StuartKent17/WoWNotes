<br />
Whispers of N'Zoth - Magni wants you to report to Kalecgos in the Chamber of Heart immediately because Ebonhorn's head is being plagued by old god whispers. MOTHER wants to &quot;sanitize&quot; him to stop the corruption, but Magni stops her.<br />
Spies to the Left and Right - Kalecgos is shocked N'Zoth could reach Ebonhorn in the safety of the chamber, and reluctantly sends you to find Wrathion at the Tavern in the Mists in Pandaria. Upon arriving you find two of Wrathions's Blacktalon Bodyguards, who say that Wrathion hasn't made contact with them in some time. They have you fight off 6 Lurking Observers (old god floating eyes) outside before giving you Wrathion's &quot;Torn Journal Page #7&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot; id=&quot;journal7&quot;&gt;https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/august/thumb/wrathion_page_7_02.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/august/wrathion_page_7_02.jpg) https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/august/thumb/wrathion_page_7_01.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/august/wrathion_page_7_01.jpg)&lt;/div&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Black Winged Shadow - The two suggest that you look for Wrathion at the entrance to Blackwing Descent, but warn you to be careful as it has become obvious you are not the only one looking for him. There you find a Blacktalon watcher being attacked by two Sleepless Operatives and a Sleepless Interrogator. When you dispatch them, you receive Wrathion's &quot;Torn Journal Page #16&quot; from the watcher, who states that the Sleepless Interrogator showed him terrible and tempting things. He says that Wrathion wanted you to have the pages, and suggests you head to the Karazhan Catacombs as Wrathion said he intended to study the artifacts stored there.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
To the Catacombs - When you reach the Catacombs, you find a Slain Blacktalon Lookout outside and collect Wrathion's &quot;Torn Journal Page #25&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot; id=&quot;journal25&quot;&gt;https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/august/thumb/wrathion_page_25_02.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/august/wrathion_page_25_02.jpg) https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/august/thumb/wrathion_page_25_01.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/august/wrathion_page_25_01.jpg)&lt;/div&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
On the Trail of the Black Prince - You take the keys to the Catacombs from the body and head down into the crypts. You must investigate some of the journals and pages left by Wrathion before slaying X'korr the Compelling, a minion of N'Zoth who holds Wrathion's &quot;Torn Journal Page #58&quot;. This one mentions Wrathion discovering a portion recipe in the catacombs that stops someone from hearing the whispers of the old gods and also states that he spoke with the spirit of Medivh and wants to follow a similar path in helping destroy the very thing that plagues him (the old gods) in order to save Azeroth. He has left a note for you with a sample of the potion for Ebonhorn.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Save Ebonhorn - Magni says you are needed back immediately and MOTHER opens a way gate to bring you back to the Chamber of Heart. You use the Potion of Mental Clarity on Ebonhorn to free him of his corruption, and he remarks that you must have found Wrathion if you have the potion. Kalecgos says Wrathion wasn't actually found, but the Black Prince seems to have found a way to resist the influence of the old gods. Ebonhorn tells you to give Wrathion's Journal pages to MOTHER, who commits the pages to memory and formulates fortification transcripts for the Chamber of Heart. She then destroys the pages to Magni's shock, but she explains that the journal said to destroy the pages. Magni says he will start looking for the Black Prince and the quest ends here.<br />

<br />

<br />
I don't usually read / look at spoilers. I read these because I'm actually very curious about Wrathion's involvement.<br />
I also read quests but that wasn't always the case, so I get where you're coming from.<br />
When I started playing, I was reading everything. But I got invited by some random in the starting area to do quests together. And he was just skipping through the text so I had to do the same to keep up. Haven't properly read quest text since then. I read some quests that looked important (like when we invaded Undercity and every expansion starting quests), but I skipped a lot.<br />
Then they announced the Warcraft movie and I decided to make sure I knew the lore before that. So I spent a few months reading all the novels. All the ingame books. All the comics. The only one I haven't read is Traveller (I have it and started on it but I stopped after about 20 pages). After that, I started reading all quests. At some point, I also used a story addon that forced you to read all text - I removed it because it was annoying on my main when I was doing repetitve stuff and only kept it on alts.<br />
<br />
So... I guess yes, there are people who do that. But I also get you, sometimes it takes a lot of willpower to read the generic lines for a quest that has you kill 10 more hydras or bring in 5 Angel Stars.</div></div><hr />

That is actually very smart! That would put an end to the endless speculation tha Alleria will go mad and usher in the return of the Void, yada yada yada.<br />
<br />
If they can mass produce those potions and give them to the Void Elves... Then that will basically make them the ultimate race, because the ONLY drawback they have would be eliminated.</div></div><hr />

What I'm more interested in is what happens to our HoA. You'd think its power was completely depleted the same way Artifacts' power was, to release N'zoth. But then, I don't really expect them to just drop HoA for 8.2.5 / 8.3 because of the AP and essences, so... a loophole?</div></div><hr />

You doing it that way =/= everyone else follows your lead. The many lore discussion threads and forums and books and cinematics etc should tell you that a lot of people care about the story.</div></div><hr />

Your math is slightly off.. It's 4.4 hours each day (66 * 24/365), so quite a lot!</div></div><hr />

Yeah that's... weird. Now we have a freaking potion to be completely, entirely, definitely immune to probably the biggest threat on Azeroth right now. Not more resilient to whispers, immune.<br />
<br />
Wut.</div></div><hr />

<br />
66 days played per year. <br />
<br />
.18 hours played per day (that's 11 minutes).<br />
<br />
No, your math isn't slightly off, it's WAY off. 66 days a year is 0.18% OF A YEAR, not OF A DAY.<br />
As another poster pointed out, that's 1584 hours. Given there are 365 days in a year, that averages out at 4 hours, 20 mins and 23 seconds per day. To average over 4 hours game time a day assuming ABSOLUTELY NOT A SINGLE DAY IS TAKEN OFF, is in 'Massively Addicted' territory. This doesn't even account for any potential alts the guy has. <br />
<br />
So he's either full of crap and massively exaggerating, or he represents 0.01% or less of the playerbase who treat the game as a part-time job.<br />
<br />
11 min playtime per day for 15 years would give you a small total of 41.8 days /played on that toon.<br />

do people really read spoilers or quests in general?<br />
<br />
playing since vanilla (almost 1000days played on main toon), dont think i ever read a ques or story line.<br />
<br />
Are you asking a serious question or just speaking rhetorically? Of course millions of people read quest text and care about the plot... If you're just running around doing shit with no context then it feels so hollow and pointless.</div></div><hr />

I also read quests but that wasn't always the case, so I get where you're coming from.<br />
When I started playing, I was reading everything. But I got invited by some random in the starting area to do quests together. And he was just skipping through the text so I had to do the same to keep up. Haven't properly read quest text since then. I read some quests that looked important (like when we invaded Undercity and every expansion starting quests), but I skipped a lot.<br />
Then they announced the Warcraft movie and I decided to make sure I knew the lore before that. So I spent a few months reading all the novels. All the ingame books. All the comics. The only one I haven't read is Traveller (I have it and started on it but I stopped after about 20 pages). After that, I started reading all quests. At some point, I also used a story addon that forced you to read all text - I removed it because it was annoying on my main when I was doing repetitve stuff and only kept it on alts.<br />
<br />
So... I guess yes, there are people who do that. But I also get you, sometimes it takes a lot of willpower to read the generic lines for a quest that has you kill 10 more hydras or bring in 5 Angel Stars.<br />
<br />
just wanna say: good and differentiated answer and to a good degree i am in the same boat.</div></div><hr />

I think its a thing healers can have now because of their heart necklace. I'm mostly guessing because I see it on players that can have healing specs and I haven't seen it as an option on my melee dps main. I'm not sure exactly what it does, but when it first came out I thought it was a battle pet. Its un-targetable though. Sure is cool looking.</div></div><hr />

The old gods are pawns of the void lords. Powerful pawns, but pawns nonetheless.<br />

You hope an old god expansion isn't going to have story elements about old gods?<br />
<br />
You hope the next expansion in a game about the old gods where every other enemy has been defeated isn't about the old gods?<br />
<br />
This is just a whole new level of ultracasual.</div></div><hr />

No judgement of language barriers intended. Your passion is understandable but a bit perplexing in this instance.<br />
<br />
Remember we did manage to defeat a couple Old Gods &quot;C'thunn, Yogg-Saron, and the still living Heart of Y'shaarg... it's really not that far of a stretch to think we might discover a potion that helps us resist an old god's influence. I mean we have potions that help us do all sorts of remarkable things, like making us invisible to everything, even being able to run past mobs and bosses... <br />
<br />
I'm not defending the writers in general... I'm very disappointed myself in the Sylvanas storyline of this expansion... I created my one and only Horde toon as forsaken because of her and her sort of vague good but bad personality (yes, yes insert your Alliance bashing here) but the Old God stuff IMO has been the most consistent facet of storytelling within the Wow-verse.</div></div><hr />

the whispers were dangerous before , anyone with enough exposure could fall to them, and now they are just an afterthought that be deal with by drinking a potion. <br />
<br />
it's like we also find out that by chewing some leaves , we can be immune to the plague and to the undeath . it 's so silly to make something that threatning loose all of it's teeth with such a simple method<br />
<br />
like alleria ' the only mortal to ever have resisted the whispers&quot; , i grinded my teeths at that but i was fine , it's one person ,it's horrible writing everyone else can still be affected... And then the void elves came along and while i bashed my head against a wall, they were a small race and some still showned some effect of the corruption so the potential for an immense fuck up on their part was still possible so i kept hope .<br />
<br />
but now , a simple potion that can be consumed by any and everyone can just lolnope the whispers , might as well delete the old gods and replace them with an angry dragon because there is nothing different between the two now .</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darksong</div><div class="date">2019-09-24, 05:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I appreciate your passion, this has been fun revisiting lore that has gotten pushed to the back of my brain by the endless AP grind. Hoping for some good new story in the patch today! I agree that there are always some plot holes to fill in, but there are some details about this specific instance that make this believable, for me anyway.<br />
<br />
I found an article where it's stated on Wowpedia that &quot;Ebyssian (Ebonhorn) cannot leave Highmountain or he risks the Old Gods trying to corrupt him.&quot; Which they do... and it makes sense that Wrathion having battled the same attacks would prepare for the eventuality that the corruption could affect another black dragon - or even himself - and leave behind something to help i.e. the potion. The quest doesn't specifically say it could work for any other race, and players don't drink it, just administer it to the afflicted NPC. Then MOTHER destroys the information. wtf...<br />
<br />
Plus we've already been cleansed of N'Zoth's influence, after being infected by the Blade of the Black empire we do a quest with Brother Pike to have the &quot;gift of N'Zoth&quot; removed from us - and it's subsequent whispers. By a simple magical spell cast by Brother Pike no less, so I don't think it unreasonable that a potion designed by a black dragon could cure another black dragon from similar affliction. (I have retained my &quot;gift&quot; for now, because I'm a warlock and don't fear self-damaging choices, HA!) So there's another example of us &quot;resisting&quot; the whispers.<br />
<br />
We know that from their prisons they can only whisper and influence and corrupt indirectly, but now that N'Zoth is free, (nice work Magni... sheesh), we may finally see an old god's true, unimpeded power. We'll likely fight him at some point, and hopefully win. As champions who've beaten many incredible foes, including a shadows of the old gods, a corrupted dragon aspect and even corrupted Titans, I bet we can manage. :)</div></div><hr />
