Path of the Titans Trinkets - Secondary Effect Only Procs in Raids<br />
The secondary proc effects on the Path of the Titans trinkets coming with Antorus in Patch 7.3.2 will only work inside of the raid. Keep in mind:<br />
<br />
<br />
Aman'Thul's Vision (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/154172-amanthuls-vision) drops from Argus and doesn't take one of your two legendary item slots.<br />
Pantheon's Blessing (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/155831-pantheons-blessing) will allow you to upgrade the epic trinkets to item level 1000 <br />
Pantheon's Blessing (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/155831-pantheons-blessing) drops from Argus on all difficulties.<br />
Your group needs four unique Path of the Titans trinket procs to be active at once to activate the secondary effect.<br />

Hey guys,<br />
<br />
A slightly different discussion here, but just popping in with a note that the secondary Equip effect on the Antorus trinkets that note &quot;When empowered by the Pantheon...&quot;, such as 'Aman'Thul's Grandeur' on Aman'Thul's Vision (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/154172-amanthuls-vision) or 'Khaz'goroth's Shaping' on Khaz'goroth's Courage (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/154176-khazgoroths-courage) will only function within the Antorus raid once it is live.<br />
<br />
Currently on the PTR this effect works outside of the raid, but its worthwhile to offer some clarification so there's no confusion once the raid itself is live.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions on this, let me know!<br />
<br />
So, we'll be able to equip a third legendary, but only if we raid in Argus?<br />
Yes. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1074668-3rd-legendary-equiped-but/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17616974063?page=1#13))<br />
<br />
Ah, wasn't aware all 6 were needed for the proc trigger. Thanks for clearing that up snarky pants.<br />
While it won't function in Mythic+ we did change the six requirement so you only need four unique buffs to trigger the Pantheon secondary proc inside Antorus. You can have any possible combination of the unique five to activate this additional proc. Aman'Thul's Vision ignores the rule as a &quot;wildcard&quot; filling any gap that you might be missing from the other five.<br />
<br />
So for example you can have two Aman'Thul's and two of the other uniques and it will trigger the Pantheon proc.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind we're still tweaking and making changes to the trinkets so please keep voicing your feedback about it <br />
<br />
I'd like to point out that Aman'Thuls does not function this way currently on the PTR, the only thing special is its starting ilevel. Only four Pantheon trinket procs of any kind need to overlap to trigger empowerment. I've tested this multiple times, using various combinations as well as four of the same trinket.<br />
Currently all of the trinkets on PTR behave like Aman'Thul's Vision does in the Pantheon proc but will be changed to be unique before it goes live, other than Aman'Thul's which will stay as a wild card.<br />
<br />
Still as always subject to change but that's the current plan.<br />
<br />
Is Aman'thul's intended to only have an Intellect proc as its secondary empowerment? Considering the value of any variant of Arcanocrystal to more than just Intellect classes, this seems like a massive oversight.<br />
That might be a tooltip issue either on the PTR or on your client side but it should change depending on whatever your primary stat is.<br />
<br />
As much as a Warrior might like to be smarter with that proc it just wouldn't exactly help.<br />
<br />
If you're getting the buff as Intellect please let us know so we can get that fixed! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1074666-amanthuls-vision-personal/) / Official Forums (https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20759219142#post-13))<br />

Local Currency Update Coming to Canada, Japan, and New Zealand<br />
Later this year, we’ll be changing pricing on Blizzard Battle.net® from USD to local currency in Canada, Japan, and New Zealand. We’re excited to introduce the change. It’s a key step toward growing our service globally and making it easier for players in these regions to shop and manage their accounts with us. <br />
<br />
Once this change takes effect, local currency will be used for pricing across Battle.net and within all of Blizzard’s game shops. The same goes for any Blizzard Balance that players in these regions have stored with us, which will convert over to their local currency. Existing recurring World of Warcraft® subscriptions will not be affected and will continue using USD. However, any new or renewed subscriptions and pre-paid Game Time cards will be offered in their local currency.<br />
<br />
While we haven’t finalized the exact date, the switch in these regions is currently slated to take effect before the end of this year. At that time, all product pricing and any stored Blizzard Balance will be converted from USD to the local currency based on the rate provided by one of the major exchanges. <br />
<br />
For players in New Zealand, pricing will be inclusive of Goods and Services Tax (GST).<br />
<br />
We want to make as many of our players as possible feel at home in the Blizzard ecosystem, regardless of where they’re logging in from. We also want to make shopping with us seamless and easy. Switching to local currencies is a key step toward achieving this. Some of our customers will be able to avoid paying unnecessary transaction fees charged by banks and financial institutions. Furthermore, this change will also help us expand the types of payment we can accept, allowing us to add payment methods that we previously couldn’t offer because of their restrictions on transacting in USD. <br />
<br />
We’ll provide an update for our players in Canada, Japan, and New Zealand once we formally make the switch to their local currencies. In the meantime, we’ve put together a brief FAQ to provide you with more information on the coming changes.<br />
<br />
FAQ<br />
<br />
When are you switching to local currency in Canada, Japan, and New Zealand?<br />
Today, we announced that the change is coming and that it’s slated to take place before the end of the year. We will provide an update to players when the transition takes place.<br />
<br />
What products will be affected by these changes?<br />
The conversion to local currencies will affect all product pricing across Blizzard Battle.net® as well as all in-game shops and any stored Blizzard Balance. Any existing recurring World of Warcraft® subscriptions will continue to use USD. However, any new or renewed subscriptions and pre-paid Game Time cards will be offered in local currency.<br />
<br />
What happens to my stored Blizzard Balance?<br />
On the date that we make the switch in your regions, your stored Blizzard Balance will convert over to local currency.<br />
<br />
What rate Is Blizzard using to convert USD to my local currency?<br />
We will use the conversion rate provided by one of the major exchanges on the day we make the transition. <br />
<br />
Why did you decide to switch from USD to local currency in my region?<br />
This is an important step for growing our service globally, making it easier for our players around the world to shop and manage their accounts with us. Some of our customers will be able to avoid paying unnecessary transaction fees charged by banks and financial institutions We’re also able to accommodate more payment methods, adding ones we previously couldn’t offer because they have restrictions on transacting in USD.<br />
<br />
What currencies does Blizzard Battle.net support?<br />
Currently, Blizzard Battle.net supports the following currencies: USD, EUR, GBP, RUB, CNY, KRW, TWD, ARS, CLP, BRL, MXN, AUD. We will soon introduce support for JPY, CAD, and NZD.<br />
<br />
Blizzard Battle.net is still using USD in my region. When will you switch to my local currency?<br />
We’ll continually evaluate which new currencies to bring to Blizzard Battle.net, and we’ll update our players accordingly.<br />
<br />
What if my Blizzard Battle.net account is registered in the wrong country and I want to switch to my local region and currency?<br />

They're built around all of antorus, the secondary proc can happen at any point during the raid itself, not just the last boss.<br />

Actually since the Aman'Thul procs are wildcards, the more of them you have the better. Ideally you want everyone to only have Aman'Thul.</div></div><hr />

All joking aside though, its great that they finally are doing this!, all the bank fees and stuff do add up when buying from blizzard.<br />
<br />
But seriously, even in Europe there is 1 single server for the few Portuguese players in that region (aggra), I wish they would do the same for the French speakers in Americas servers, since as it stands its pretty fragmented between a few servers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's already made a joke by the aman'thul trinket<br />
<br />
Imagine for example<br />
Exorsus gets 9 aman'thul drops,Method 4 and AFK R 0<br />
<br />
That's a massive avantage for Exorsus on 3 aspects : Trinket ilvl,Arcanocrystals,and even raid wide procs (as aman'thul is a wildcard,having a lot of them makes getting the raid wide proc way easier)</div></div><hr />

It doesn't matter in outdoor soloing stuff. But it definitely will matter in 5man m+.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope, not an error. It's kind of a special trinket, in that they know people will highly covet it because it's basically another arcano crystal, and the fact that it's a &quot;wildcard&quot; when trying to proc the Pantheon empowerment.</div></div><hr />

It's a joke it only procs in raids. This game is on rails now - like the log ride at Disneyland. What a joke of a game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right, because you often get 4+ people together with these trinkets outside of raid... They already have enough issues allowing set items from Raids in M+, the only real time you'd have to worry about the secondary proc, it's a good thing they don't do that proc there, the main proc still works.</div></div><hr />

Hi,<br />
<br />
The article on wowhead (http://www.wowhead.com/news=273877/legendary-items-in-patch-7-3-2-and-antorus-the-burning-throne) states &quot;Drop from Argus the Unmaker on Normal, Heroic, or Mythic.&quot; but hopefully that'll change, LFR would be sweet too!<br />
<br />
However, do give Normal difficulty a shot yourself, though, it's often easier than you think and the only down side is you'll need more time (like 2 hours) to do it one whole run -rather than the wings of LFR. If it still feels like too much pressure, (understandable!) then join a guild that has an alt run or has Normal on farm -it is such a breeze in that environment and you'll feel much more confident after!<br />
<br />
Best of luck</div></div><hr />

well that sucks a dookers... now im gonna have to pay someone just to get a legendary... and ot may not even be 100% drop rate</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baneleaf</div><div class="date">2017-10-18, 09:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love that they were kind enough that they translated that forum post in French for Canadians but dont have any support for French on the NA wow client or have any server without going to EU and installing said wow client... <br />
<br />
All joking aside though, its great that they finally are doing this!, all the bank fees and stuff do add up when buying from blizzard.<br />
<br />
But seriously, even in Europe there is 1 single server for the few Portuguese players in that region (aggra), I wish they would do the same for the French speakers in Americas servers, since as it stands its pretty fragmented between a few servers.<br />
<br />
Having played on a server with a large French speaking presence (at one time Bleeding Hollow, I am not sure now) I can say TOO DAMN BAD. I am currently stuck on a server that is now linked to the Brazilian servers and I have no recourse other than to transfer my entire team (23 level 110 and countless 100+) to try to get away from them because they infest LFR and LFD and insist on speaking Portuguese in chat and ignore you when you ask them to not stand in fire. If the French speaking population of Canada cannot speak English on US servers then you deserve the lag to play on French servers. Do not insist that US servers bend to your will and make French clients. Yes, I know I sound like a complete asshole American for this but I have been so furious with the Brazilians that if I have to deal with more language barriers on the US based servers I will just freaking quit this game that I have played and enjoyed for over a decade. <br />
<br />
HOWEVER, I can definately get behind the currency conversion issue since I know there are a lot of bank fees for transferring your currency to US then sending it to Blizzard instead of just letting you pay in your currency and just adjusting the prices as needed. <br />
