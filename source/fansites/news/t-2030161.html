Legion adds the Wardrobe system, allowing you to collect appearances without holding on to the items! <br />
<br />
<br />
Void Storage still exists and is unchanged.<br />
You need to visit a Transmogrification NPC to hide your cloak, helm, or shoulders now. <br />
A new tab has been added to the collections pane, allowing you to browse all of the appearances wherever you are in game. <br />
You can filter by collected and uncollected appearances, as well as weapon types and appearance sources. <br />
You can save sets and apply them to all specs or just a specific spec, causing your transmog to change with your spec. <br />

&lt;/div&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Interface Options<br />
Many of the interface options were removed from the UI in Legion. You can use the AdvancedInterfaceOptions addon (http://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/advancedinterfaceoptions) to access them now.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot; id=&quot;gallery-WoWOptionsGone&quot;&gt;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/march/thumb/interfaceoptionsv201.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/march/interfaceoptionsv201.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/march/thumb/interfaceoptionsv202.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/march/interfaceoptionsv202.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/march/thumb/interfaceoptionsv203.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/march/interfaceoptionsv203.jpg) <br />

<br />
<br />
Character Pane<br />
The stats in the character pane were greatly simplified in Leigon.<br />
<br />
<br />
The developers confirmed (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/409185-new-character-pane-stats-window/#post7) that no alternative view is planned<br />
You can use the DejaCharacterStats addon (http://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/dejacharacterstats) to restore some of the functionality. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Combat<br />
Nameplates, unit frames, and other parts of the combat UI got an upgrade.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nameplates were redesigned to have a more compact default look, with the option to make them larger.<br />
Nameplates show the duration or presence or different effects you would normally see on the enemy unit frame.<br />
A new personal resource display that shows your health, power, and additional resources displays under your character while in combat. <br />
The targeting circle now has a pointer on it to indicate which direction the NPC is facing. <br />
Floating combat text and target area selection circles are now sharper.<br />
NPCs that give credit for a quest you are on have an orange glow under them.<br />
Health and Power bars now have a little animation that fades out the gain or loss that is happening. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
The PvP UI has been updated with Honor talents and reward changes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Honor Talents have been added to the talents pane. These unlock as your Honor Level increases.<br />
Your honor level is displayed in multiple places in the PvP UI. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot; id=&quot;gallery-PVP&quot;&gt;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/july/thumb/honorTalents.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/july/honorTalents.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/july/thumb/pvpPane.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/july/pvpPane.jpg) &lt;/div&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Maps<br />
There were lots of updates to the flight path map and a few to the minimap.<br />
<br />
<br />
The flight path map for the Broken Isles is larger, allowing you to zoom in to individual zones and pan around the map. <br />
World quests are shown on the Broken Isles flight path map. <br />
Undiscovered flight paths are shown on the map.<br />
The minimap now displays if something is above or below you, as well as greying out things that are not outside, such as NPCs in a building or cave.<br />
The world map highlights cave entrances for quests. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot; id=&quot;gallery-maps&quot;&gt;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/july/thumb/minimap01.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/july/minimap01.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/july/thumb/worldMap00.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/july/worldMap00.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/july/thumb/worldMap01.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/july/worldMap01.jpg) &lt;/div&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
The professions UI got some upgrades to make it easier to use. <br />
<br />
<br />
The professions pane is now split, with a recipe list on the left and the description and materials on the right. <br />
The window shows the current rank you have unlocked for a recipe, with higher ranks making crafting cheaper or gathering more rewarding.<br />
The learned and unlearned items are now shown using two different tabs. <br />
Unlearned recipes provide some information about where to learn them and the cost. <br />
New categories have been added. <br />
You can now filter recipes by source.<br />
Mass Prospecting has been added for Legion materials: Mass Prospect Leystone (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/225902-mass-prospect-leystone)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Graphics Settings<br />
The Graphic Settings have been updated for Legion: <br />
<br />
<br />
The overall graphics quality is now a number from 1 to 10. <br />
View distance has been increased (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5741-Engineer-s-Workshop-Extended-Draw-Distance) and now has a slider that goes from 1 to 10, <br />
A new maximum setting for shadows has been added: Ultra High <br />

<br />
<br />
Action Camera<br />
The Action Camera is an unsupported experiment that the developers added that makes camera movement more dynamic. <br />
<br />
<br />
Any of these commands can be placed after /console actioncam<br />
<br />
Default - Default settings<br />
full, basic, off, on - Preset settings for each state <br />
noHeadMove, lowHeadMove, heavyHeadMove - Change camera head movement<br />
focusOn, focusOff - Causes the camera to shift to maintain a focus on your target<br />
<br />
Be sure to check out the DynamicCam addon when it is released.<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
There were lots of other little changes and improvements:<br />
<br />
<br />
The Adventure Journal now has loot information for all of the raids in the game. <br />
Heirloom items (http://beta.wowdb.com/items?filter-quality=128) now use a bright blue quality color (Gronntooth War Horn (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/133595-gronntooth-war-horn)).<br />
Pets and Mounts from the shop have a little unwrapping animation before you can use them. <br />
Achievements are now searchable with the new search box. <br />
Bosses now have a large glow when there is loot on them for you.<br />
The glyph pane is gone. You can apply glyphs directly to spells in the spellbook. <br />
Talking heads appear during quests to go along with the voice acting. <br />
You can now ignore quests. <br />
You can click on a talent to learn it. The extra step to confirm has been removed.</div></div><hr />

I really don't like the fact that you will now get the item's skin despite ability to sell it.. That will greatly devalue the skins as any rare item can now be passed on an infinite amount of times. But I guess that's the direction WoW been heading in for a while - cool stuff for everybody.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You only unlock a skin when you equip a BoE item, and if it's a raid drop then you lose the skin if you trade it to someone else or sell it before the 2 hour timer is out.</div></div><hr />

Must be some technical limitation that forced Blizzards hand. I doubt that they did that because they wanted to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is correct - an appearance is only unlocked once it is soulbound to that character. Appearances for items that still have a trade timer (example: gear acquired in a raid or dungeon) or sell back timer (example: gear acquired at the PvP vendor) will not be unlocked until the timer has expired.</div></div><hr />

Yeh, I agree this is dumb. I often swapped between hat/no hat through out a raid. It was fun for me. <br />
<br />
I mean, why do I have to go see some space mummy to get permission to take off or put on my hat? <br />
<br />
They need to put this option into the UI somehow.</div></div><hr />

No - transmog the slot, not the item. Transmogging the item is stupid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you loot an item that you can equip (e.g. Plate on a Paladin) you unlock the appearance. If you sell or equip it, you can no longer trade it to anyone else that was eligible, even if you buy it back. If you trade it, you no longer have the appearance.<br />

So if a Warrior equips cloth does it add it to the collection pane or does an actual cloth wearer have to equip it?<br />
<br />
Has to be a cloth wearer. You only unlock appearances for what your main armor is.</div></div><hr />

I can't help the feeling that Blizz is making each expansion for dumber and dumber people. OH NOES. TOO MANY STATS. ME NOT UNDERSTAND?! WHY IS DAT FOR? OH NOES TOO MANY SPELLZ. PLZ REMUV DEM. OH NOOOES! SO MANY OPTIONZZZ. ME LOST. Duh... It's also riddicoulus that you need Addon to show you something, which should be deafult. Camera distance change is also dumb idea. And less interface options.... wha... i don't even... Could this game BE even more simplified?!<br />
<br />
Ugh... if there still will be same endgame PvE system: LFR&gt;Normal&gt;Heroic&gt;Mythic, then I'm not coming back. Just kick one - LFR or Heroic, I don't care which. I have enough of repeating same content 4 times, just with harder mechanics. It's not Diablo. And even classic Diablo had 3! difficulties. <br />
<br />
Yes, LFR is optional. But try not to do LFR and not be behind with your gear. <br />

In the other hand... maybe it's better to finally say goodbye to 8 year addiction...</div></div><hr />

there's player selected tracking (with the check mark), &quot;you just picked up the quest so its being tracked without the check mark&quot;, and &quot;you aren't tracking any quests so the system is displaying all quests nearby on the minimap&quot; any of those will generate the lines</div></div><hr />

<br />
The glyph change doesn't really have anything to do with simplification. There was just nothing interesting or good about major glyphs, it was mostly a couple of mandatory glyphs that literally everyone was using because all other glyphs was complete garbage. Minor glyphs are pretty much the same as before, there's just no reason to have a dedicated page for them.</div></div><hr />

Stop making excuses and get better. Learn to farm gear. In WoD I along with most of the raiding community started running CM modes even at Bronze timers just to get the strongbox with the 640 epics. When Highmaul came out we were all around 635+. In another week 650+ and then full heroic tier with some mythic pieces. Then BRF We started straight at HC and got full 685-690, then HFC normal&gt;HC so on. Not once did I touch LFR to get gear. The only reason I'd run LFR was to get stones/ tomes for the Ring questline so your argument is invalid you just aren't a good player. And don't talk about how you didn't have time I did this in around 2-3 hours of playtime everyday. Don't make excuses for being bad and doing LFR. Also please tell me what the point of showing your intelligence/agility/spirit is when you're a Strength class. Waste of time. What is the point of keeping redundant skills in the spell book which you'd never touch? Waste of time. Stop whining you 'Veteran's are the plague of the wow community</div></div><hr />

Completely agree with you. It's like the whole world (including Azeroth) is being dumbed down for the sake of the few who can't chew gum and walk at the same time. <br />
<br />
Also hate these idiotic 'talking heads' frames that take up so much visual real estate (and god forbid you should accidentally move your cursor over them as they're fading). Can't get rid of them, can't disable them - can't do a damn thing about them.<br />
<br />
And whats with the oversized profession windows all of a sudden? Used to be you could have one open alongside the AH window so you could check things while scouring the AH - but not anymore.<br />
<br />
Seems to me anything we find helpful, useful, or (heaven forbid!) actually 'fun', is suddenly distasteful to Blizz and therefore must be changed/removed, because there's no accounting for their idea of 'logic'.<br />
<br />
Could they trash our game anymore if they tried? I mean, really!<br />

Oh I haven't checked some of this out, I used to play on a standard monitor and no matter what I opened (bar preview) the AH window would always close, the monitor Im on now, I have enough room for the AH, Profession and character screen.
