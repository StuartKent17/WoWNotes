What rework are you talking about when did they say they will ever do a rework. The most we can expect is ele changes which is an insult to a band aid fix. They literally spit on every single shadow priest in the game with this buff.</div></div><hr />

Why would DH's need a buff right now. Havoc does good dps in PVE, and is a good spec in PVP. Vengeance is also strong in M+ and while not the greatest tank in raiding, it's still viable.</div></div><hr />

Yep, a 5% buff every week for 1.5 years will only give you about a 3800% damage buff in total, definitely required to be viable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They mentioned a full rework going into BFA. Multiple times. In stream. On camera. For no earlier than 8.1. You can go back through several weeks of posts on wowhead. I'm sure they still have the videos of Ion talking about it.<br />
<br />
They aren't spitting on Shadow priests with this. This is a &quot;8.1 is a honking big patch that won't be out any time soon, so let's give them something to help a little before then&quot; change. Rework means exactly that -- mechanical changes. Changes to talents, and given the mention of how much effort it would be, I wouldn't be surprised if they did mechanical changes to the base class abilities. That means removing, adding, changing. That takes a lot of time to code, test, and evaluate.</div></div><hr />

unholy single target isn't good..but it's spread aoe and any fight where dots can be present for a decent enough time to get epidemic damage in it's fine.</div></div><hr />

It's kinda sad how in the older expansions, you wouldn't run into that problem often. Now , especially on mythic, it seems that having spread adds spawn all over is the best way Blizz thinks they can add difficulty to a fight.</div></div><hr />

Link 1 source that said anything more than just &quot;changes&quot;. That can mean literally just this non &quot;buff&quot; to a full rework, and considering they said the same thing about shamans and considering that they actually focused alot more on shamans with blue posts and Q&amp;As and not a single mention of shadow since that one live stream, chances are that at most we are getting the ele treatment which is absolutely nothing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not doing your homework for you. I paid attention to when BFA was coming out. I'm not spending three hours re-reading wowhead posts just because you're too damn lazy to. See if you get lucky with a google search or something. I pointed you in the direction. If you want to be lazy, I can't stop you, but maybe you'll be delighted when they're finally done with it.<br />
<br />
They literally said there was a rework in process for Shadow that was too much for the 8.0 launch and that it would have to be delayed until 8.1. This slight numbers tuning? This is not a rework, and doesn't take any time for them to do. I didn't pay attention much to the other classes, to be honest. They could be giving better communication on shaman simply because they weren't slated for rework.<br />
<br />
But seriously. Stop being lazy and do a damn search.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Using this as baseline: <br />
https://www.warcraftlogs.com/zone/statistics/19#difficulty=4&amp;dataset=95&amp;aggregate=amount<br />
<br />
The 4% UDK buff will bring them from 13608 to 14152, above Shadowpriests and below Balance Druids. <br />
<br />
The 4% Feral buff will bring them from 13932 to 14489, above Ret Paladins and below Destruction Locks. <br />
<br />
The 5% Fire buff will bring them from 13562 to 14240, above Balance Druids and below Fury Warriors.<br />
<br />
The 1% Shadow buff will bring them from 14068 to 14208, same position. <br />
(Note: This assumes a pure single target fight where we even use Mind Flay, many fights we don't ever use it, in which case this is literally not a buff). <br />
<br />
The 5% Enhancement buff will bring them from 13707 to 14392, above Fury Warriors and below Ret Paladins.<br />
<br />
For the Elemental and Demonology buff I need a more involved method, so I will be looking at the top parses for both specs for Heroic Taloc for Single Target.<br />
<br />
Elemental Single Target: <br />
https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/ADp23dRr1Vfaztwv#fight=2&amp;type=damage-done<br />
<br />
Lightning Bolt is 6% of damage done, Chain Lightning and Earthquake are AOE and not used. This buff represents a 0.9% single target buff: <br />
<br />
The 0.9% buff will bring Elemental from 13720 to 13843, no position change (they would have passed Feral but Feral also got buffed). <br />
Note: This is strictly a single target measurement, while the Chain Lightning and Earthquake buffs are fairly significant for AOE.<br />
<br />
<br />
Demonology Single Target: <br />
https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/2TytnHbpzdkYWwQr#fight=1&amp;type=damage-done&amp;source=6<br />
<br />
Shadowbolt is 7%, Call Dreadstalker is 10%, Demonbolt is 11%. This represents a 4% overall single target buff. <br />
<br />
The 4% buff to Demonology will increase dps from 13353 to 13887, above Elemental Shamans and below Frost Mages. <br />
<br />
<br />
Congratulations to Marksmanship Hunters, you are now by your lonesome, well below even the other worst specs in the game!<br />
<br />
The bottom of the meter now goes: <br />
<br />
Marksmen &lt; Frost Mage &lt; Shadowpriest &lt; UDK<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hmm which spells can we buff for shadow to make it look like we're doing something?<br />
<br />
^ This. <br />
<br />
Mind Flay is 10% of our damage in single target, so the Mind Flay buff is a 1% single target buff. <br />
<br />
We don't use Mind Sear on any of the raid bosses in this tier, so it's a 0% buff to raiding. <br />
So I tried Mythic+ logs to find someone using Mind Sear, one of the highest Shadowpriest Mythic+ runs I found was a M14 Motherlode with a Spriest. <br />
3.55% of their overall damage was Mind Sear, so it's about a 0.65% buff to Mythic+'s at most.</div></div><hr />

This essentially means that the classes and/or specs that were very underpowered at launch, which people POINTED OUT, took LITERALLY 30 days to get buffed appropriately.<br />
<br />
Those specs have been playing the game with subpar damage this entire time. Too bad the initial rush of content and gameplay is basically over. Would have been nice to be competitive back when Uldir first launched.</div></div><hr />

I'm all in favor of the movement mechanics, but, Blizz, you need to help the turret casters be less turrets.

<br />
they're already in a very good spot in uldir due to their insane execute, they're underplayed but that's mainly because everyone just stopped playing it when it was garbage at the start of the expac.<br />
<br />
they literally got a biger buff than feral druids did.<br />
<br />
how is that rational?<br />
<br />
even method said if they realized sooner that fire mage execute was so good they wouldve geared them for ghuun.<br />
<br />
with the arcane nerfs last week, and frost generally not being that great in raids atm, fire is now easily the best overall mage spec in uldir.<br />
<br />
and their execute is super value on the last 2 bosses (especially ghuun)</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is not a single Unholy DK on Fetid, Mythrax or Ghuun<br />
As a result the fight where they are strong (Read : Zul cleave strat) and where DK UH are actually brought up end up over-valued in the stats<br />

They literally said there was a rework in process for Shadow that was too much for the 8.0 launch and that it would have to be delayed until 8.1. This slight numbers tuning?

<br />
well, maybe he is one of those players without arms? As a mage I would not play fire right now, just because it has no edge over other specs in any way. If I refuse to play something more viable that means I am willing to take a hit for that and I love my spec. more than raiding. It is pain to see fav. spec sucking, but when that is the case.. well complain and do nothing, waiting for fix or fix it yourself and continue raiding.<br />

<br />
Using this as baseline: <br />
https://www.warcraftlogs.com/zone/statistics/19#difficulty=4&amp;dataset=95&amp;aggregate=amount<br />
<br />
The 4% UDK buff will bring them from 13608 to 14152, above Shadowpriests and below Balance Druids. <br />
<br />
The 4% Feral buff will bring them from 13932 to 14489, above Ret Paladins and below Destruction Locks. <br />
<br />
The 5% Fire buff will bring them from 13562 to 14240, above Balance Druids and below Fury Warriors.<br />
<br />
The 1% Shadow buff will bring them from 14068 to 14208, same position. <br />
(Note: This assumes a pure single target fight where we even use Mind Flay, many fights we don't ever use it, in which case this is literally not a buff). <br />
<br />
The 5% Enhancement buff will bring them from 13707 to 14392, above Fury Warriors and below Ret Paladins.<br />
<br />
For the Elemental and Demonology buff I need a more involved method, so I will be looking at the top parses for both specs for Heroic Taloc for Single Target.<br />
<br />
Elemental Single Target: <br />
https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/ADp23dRr1Vfaztwv#fight=2&amp;type=damage-done<br />
<br />
Lightning Bolt is 6% of damage done, Chain Lightning and Earthquake are AOE and not used. This buff represents a 0.9% single target buff: <br />
<br />
The 0.9% buff will bring Elemental from 13720 to 13843, no position change (they would have passed Feral but Feral also got buffed). <br />
Note: This is strictly a single target measurement, while the Chain Lightning and Earthquake buffs are fairly significant for AOE.<br />
<br />
<br />
Demonology Single Target: <br />
https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/2TytnHbpzdkYWwQr#fight=1&amp;type=damage-done&amp;source=6<br />
<br />
Shadowbolt is 7%, Call Dreadstalker is 10%, Demonbolt is 11%. This represents a 4% overall single target buff. <br />
<br />
The 4% buff to Demonology will increase dps from 13353 to 13887, above Elemental Shamans and below Frost Mages. <br />
<br />
<br />
Congratulations to Marksmanship Hunters, you are now by your lonesome, well below even the other worst specs in the game!<br />
<br />
The bottom of the meter now goes: <br />
<br />
Marksmen &lt; Frost Mage &lt; Shadowpriest &lt; UDK<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
^ This. <br />
<br />
Mind Flay is 10% of our damage in single target, so the Mind Flay buff is a 1% single target buff. <br />
<br />
We don't use Mind Sear on any of the raid bosses in this tier, so it's a 0% buff to raiding. <br />
So I tried Mythic+ logs to find someone using Mind Sear, one of the highest Shadowpriest Mythic+ runs I found was a M14 Motherlode with a Spriest. <br />
3.55% of their overall damage was Mind Sear, so it's about a 0.65% buff to Mythic+'s at most.<br />
<br />

Why are you making me sad all the time? When will you learn, pulling &quot;all bosses&quot; stats off of Warcraftlogs proves basically nothing?<br />
<br />
For people saying UHDK is completely fine, here's a list reflecting Heroic Uldir WCL stats in the moment of me writing this comment:<br />
<br />
Taloc - In lower percentiles, bottom 2-3, in higher percentiles, dead last.<br />
Mother - Middle of the pack (like, literally 12th out of the 24 specs) in &quot;mid&quot; percentiles, falls to &quot;lower middle of the pack&quot; in high and low percentiles. (This boss isn't a good benchmark tho imo, due to the mechanics)<br />
Fetid Devourer - Bottom 6-7<br />
Zek'voz - Bottom 8 in low percentiles bottom 2-3 in mid-high percentiles<br />
Vectis - Bottom 2 in high percentiles, bottom 4-5 in low percentiles.<br />
Zul - Even with the &quot;cleave strat&quot; UHDK is in a limbo around middle of the pack<br />
Mythrax - DEAD LAST from 50th percentile and above, bottom 2-3 below it.<br />
G'huun - In a limbo in the &quot;lower middle of the pack&quot;.<br />
<br />
(And before you go &quot;lOl wHo cArEs aBoUt hErOiC StAtS&quot;, as people mentioned in earlier comments, late Uldir bosses have very few parses on Mythic, and there are bosses which have ZERO UHDK stats at the moment, so you can't draw conclusions for a few more weeks on Mythic difficulty.)<br />
<br />
Alas yeah, if you think a spec is &quot;fine&quot;, while it is usually in the bottom third of the list, sometimes even in the bottom 5, you're delusional.<br />
<br />
But you know what? I wouldn't mind being dead last on every fight even, iF the difference between first and last would be like 5%... But when it's 15-20% in some cases, you really have a f*cked up balance in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have two options then at this point because you don't want to believe what your fellows are telling you. You can either stay playing a weak spec, or you can reroll. You've already been told that the developers are aware and are working on stuff. You can deny that too. You've also been told that developers listen, but since you don't believe anything else you've been told, you probably believe that the developers don't listen to the playerbase.

i find it really helps when a spec has its BEST TWO FIGHTS IN THE RAID, actually logged, instead of looking at 6 out of the 8 fights.<br />
<br />
Being competitive on only 25% of fights is not nearly sufficient - not to mention specs like affliction are still beating balance on those fights AND are actually competitive on other fights.<br />
<br />
So this &quot;keep on waiting&quot; logic is completely blasted and holds no water.</div></div><hr />

Simcraft is an unreliable data source for overall balance, WCL data is better because it's based on real empirical evidence of performance.<br />
Adjusting for the top 5% of logs is functionally similar to parsing for a ~perfect performance without including the unlikely &quot;I only have 30% crit, but I had 80% of my abilities crit during that fight&quot; anomalous data, which using a 100% log would cause. <br />
<br />
2 week range is used because it reflects the latest data relevant to these specs and includes a gargantuan data set with hundreds of thousands of logs: more than Simcraft.<br />
<br />
So, my methodology had a reason, and I prefer it to basing it off Simcraft.</div></div><hr />

You have to watch through the whole answer because he doesn't mention specifics until the end. The gist of it is &quot;Yeah, we know these classes are in a shitty place right now, but we don't have enough time to do major stuff on them for 8.0 and the release of BFA. Their reworks will have to wait until 8.1.&quot;<br />
<br />
And this isn't the only communication where they mentioned the rework. I'm not going to look for those since that's a lot of extra work I'm not obligated to do.<br />
<br />
If you want to disbelieve actual recorded discussions, there is nothing I can do for you.</div></div><hr />

Literally did not mention the word rework once in the whole question ( with an exception on demo locks at the begging when he used that as an example of something they will not do ). Second they the word changes over and over again and regarding your tweet they said specifically major changes and they already did the major change for ele and all they did was give them 2 talents which are lackluster and didn't do anything for them. So yes you are lying and deluding yourself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
they're already in a very good spot in uldir due to their insane execute, they're underplayed but that's mainly because everyone just stopped playing it when it was garbage at the start of the expac.<br />
<br />
they literally got a biger buff than feral druids did.<br />
<br />
how is that rational?<br />
<br />
even method said if they realized sooner that fire mage execute was so good they wouldve geared them for ghuun.<br />
<br />
with the arcane nerfs last week, and frost generally not being that great in raids atm, fire is now easily the best overall mage spec in uldir.<br />
<br />
and their execute is super value on the last 2 bosses (especially ghuun)<br />
<br />
I am laughing so hard right now with that comment. Have u play fire mage at all during this expansion before saying those stupid things? Oh i heard method that .. pls go check logs and go do some m+ as fire and raids , then come back here and rewrite that . From those words i can say that u didnt play that spec at all during that expansion . Its only good for the last 2 bosses thnx to mobility it gives and bosses mechanics . NOT all bosses have those lol .</div></div><hr />

it was already buffed like 3 times this expac<br />

it's suffering from the exact same thing sub did in EN and ToV.<br />
<br />
it was bad for so quite a while so nobody played it.<br />
<br />
and then it became the best spec of the 3 and even after it was underplayed as fuck and everyone was assa.<br />
<br />
after this 5% buff I think fire will outperform the other 2 specs overall, sure frost/arcane will be better in some fights (mythrax and fetid respectively) but then again fire is far and away the best for ghuun, and it's great overall. it's perceived to be bad, so nobody's playing it even though it really isnt.<br />

For the Elemental and Demonology buff I need a more involved method, so I will be looking at the top parses for both specs for Heroic Taloc for Single Target.<br />
<br />
Elemental Single Target: <br />
https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/ADp23dRr1Vfaztwv#fight=2&amp;type=damage-done<br />
<br />
Lightning Bolt is 6% of damage done, Chain Lightning and Earthquake are AOE and not used. This buff represents a 0.9% single target buff: <br />
<br />
The 0.9% buff will bring Elemental from 13720 to 13843, no position change (they would have passed Feral but Feral also got buffed). <br />
Note: This is strictly a single target measurement, while the Chain Lightning and Earthquake buffs are fairly significant for AOE.<br />

Demonology Single Target: <br />
https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/2TytnHbpzdkYWwQr#fight=1&amp;type=damage-done&amp;source=6<br />
<br />
Shadowbolt is 7%, Call Dreadstalker is 10%, Demonbolt is 11%. This represents a 4% overall single target buff. <br />
<br />
The 4% buff to Demonology will increase dps from 13353 to 13887, above Elemental Shamans and below Frost Mages. <br />
<br />
<br />
Congratulations to Marksmanship Hunters, you are now by your lonesome, well below even the other worst specs in the game!<br />

Marksmen &lt; Frost Mage &lt; Shadowpriest &lt; UDK<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
^ This. <br />
<br />
Mind Flay is 10% of our damage in single target, so the Mind Flay buff is a 1% single target buff. <br />
<br />
We don't use Mind Sear on any of the raid bosses in this tier, so it's a 0% buff to raiding. <br />
So I tried Mythic+ logs to find someone using Mind Sear, one of the highest Shadowpriest Mythic+ runs I found was a M14 Motherlode with a Spriest. <br />
3.55% of their overall damage was Mind Sear, so it's about a 0.65% buff to Mythic+'s at most.<br />
<br />
The thing with ELE shamans is that the level 60 tier talent allot of people will replace the magma totem with the lightning/chain lightning overload talent as well since the distance was 90 dps before but the lightning but will make it the new best and a passive talent allowing for moor dps because your curing a 1 minute CD off your global and a 15% but to the talents overload.<br />

<br />
Because the playstyle of BoS wasnt fun in Legion and it hasnt become more entertaining with BfA and reduced resource generation / movement intensive fights, regardless if the idea behind BoS switched from &quot;generate as much RP as you can for BoS time&quot; to &quot;lets nuke for a short period and then play like the Obliterate build&quot;.<br />
<br />
And shamefuly, Unholy went to &quot;use around 6 GCD so I can finally deal damage if I dont have to run / switch targets&quot;.<br />
There isnt really much choice if you want to play DK DD, Im afraid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What the actual f are you talking about? Fury warriors are literally like one of the best single target DPS specs currently(Source: Simulationcraft), and are somehow apparently also one of the best speccs for M+ Dungeons (Source: Warcraftlogs).</div></div><hr />

Maybe, we could get some sort of magic mitigation skill. spells are slaughtering us atm, this is a very spell heavy expansion.</div></div><hr />

One week later...... Class A has been buffed 50%!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yvaelle</div><div class="date">2018-10-02, 02:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Still allways get 75% percentile as the average cause thats the big percentage that actually matter not the top end tier 95%+ ones<br />
<br />
95th percentile is what you use to compare potential. We don't determine potential using using 75th percentile because we are looking for what is perfect play without anomalous beneficial circumstances (ex. critting way above normal, crazy lucky procs, crazy drop luck, etc - that's your 99 or max percentiles). Comparing the peak potential of classes for DPS like this is the right time to use 95th. <br />
<br />
If we were talking about comparing classes as most people experience them - 75th percentile would be the way to go - as that would reflect a class played well through a fight, without deaths or crazy bad rotation mess-ups where they know what they did wrong, etc.</div></div><hr />

Because it's utter shit in pvp and has a long ramp-up. And according to your beloved logs, unholy performs above mid tier only on Zul in the raid.</div></div><hr />

They don't know jack shit. That guy basically looked at WCLogs, and thought &quot; ok DK is very strong &quot;.<br />
It's only Frost DK, and their gameplay is the worst ever. Even Warcraft 1 Orcs &amp; Humans had a better gameplay.<br />
Read. Think. Then answer.<br />
<br />
I couldn't care less about how fun your class is to play. Im talking numbers and thats what matters when simply buffing damage.</div></div><hr />
