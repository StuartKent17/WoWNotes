<br />
There is a new event, the Brewfest Chowdown, which is an eating contest. <br />
<br />
The event begins once 4 people click the stand.<br />
You have 3 buttons - one to eat, one to drink, and one to call for more food.<br />
<br />
Eating fills your bar<br />
Drinking reduces the bar.<br />
You have to call for more food after eating 3x.<br />
<br />
The goal is to be the first to finish 10 plates while trying not to let the bar get to 100 as it makes you choke for a few seconds<br />
<br />
A variety of events (other than a Dark Iron attack) can happen such as alementals running rampant or Hozen attacks.<br />
Down With The Dark Iron (https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/1186-down-with-the-dark-iron) has been removed from the Brewmaster (https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/1683-brewmaster) achievement.<br />
The loot from Coren Direbrew (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/23872-coren-direbrew) is item level 395 for max level characters.<br />

Yeah. I know. The issue for me is that not only put the Beer Keg Dispenser NPC slightly further away than he usually sits, but then you have to run PAST him to get to the barrel of apples further behind him, instead of doing an immediate U-turn the moment you see him tossing the beer keg like we used to. I just completed a run, and got 8 less tickets than I used to, meaning I delivered 4 less kegs than the previous year.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I should rephrase my comment. It is a lot less efficient as Alliance now. Horde didn't change. You could previously keep max gallop on Alliance without going to the end barrel, now you need to for max gallop although I would think slowing slightly to yellow for a bit may be faster in the long run rather than going full for a further distance.<br />
<br />
Like you say, you used to be able to turn a good bit before the barrel chucker (and still get a barrel thrown to you) and get to the third barrel to reset before you hit 100. <br />
<br />
It also seems odd that only Alliance got the third barrel removed.</div></div><hr />

If you can even get the thing started. I'm told its buggy AF but can't be sure myself since no one is even around to try the damn thing. No idea why they thought requiring 4 players was a good idea, first day of the event and its already a ghost town.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I heroic raid and do mythics - but even on my alts all of them have at least 410 stuff courtesy of mechagon.<br />
<br />
I don't do alts, I only use them for professions so they only sport Benthic gear. So I guess they'd be useful for my 15 alts, if I actually took them out to do Coren. I'm only using 4 for tokens to get the stuff I want, one could get lucky.<br />

I hate the sausage game competition.<br />
<br />
I just settled for not getting that toy, it's too much of a bother. It's bugged and RNG all in one:<br />
- whether you make it on the chair is luck-based or rather depends on how fast the others are clicking on the chair of your choice<br />
- you sometimes start with full energy and it doesn't go down to 0 until the count starts<br />
- you sometimes start with 1 point<br />
- the number of sausages on your plate varies (how does this make any sense? in what competition would this be consider per rules?)<br />
- the energy the beer reduces varies<br />
- the energy a sausage gives you varies<br />
<br />
There are some tricks to it, but you sometimes have to fck others for them. I'm just gonna save myself the trouble and skip the whole thing.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pacster</div><div class="date">2019-09-23, 03:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah. I know. The issue for me is that not only put the Beer Keg Dispenser NPC slightly further away than he usually sits, but then you have to run PAST him to get to the barrel of apples further behind him, instead of doing an immediate U-turn the moment you see him tossing the beer keg like we used to. I just completed a run, and got 8 less tickets than I used to, meaning I delivered 4 less kegs than the previous year.<br />
<br />
To be fair: Alliance could finish way more beer runs due to that all those years. It's about time that you can't get 2-3 runs more in than horde.</div></div><hr />

So, assuming that's correct... instead of making things better to the Horde, they decide to make things worse for the Alliance.<br />
<br />
Why am I not surprised?</div></div><hr />

If the effect is the EXACT SAME, does it matter?</div></div><hr />

You have 50 dollars in your wallet. Your brother only has 25 dollars. Would you prefer your father gave your brother 25 dollars to get you two even, or would you rather your father took 25 dollars off YOUR wallet to make the two of you even?<br />
<br />
That aside, no, the effects are not the &quot;exact same&quot;. Because one side is being negatively impacted. They'd have to grind more beer runs to buy the items they want than they used to.</div></div><hr />
