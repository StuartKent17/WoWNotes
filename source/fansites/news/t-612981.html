With the release of upcoming content patch players will see a change in the way we allow buffs and debuffs to stack exclusively in a raid. For the most part, what this change means is that many buffs and debuffs that were previously allowed to stack together no longer can, and that many buffs and debuffs that only a single talent specialization could bring can now be brought by multiple different specializations. The philosophy behind this change shows up in many of the changes we have made in Wrath of The Lich King, such as when we made almost all buffs raid-wide. We want players to be able to form raids and parties based on who they want to play with, rather than who has the correct talents and abilities to min-max their raid performance.<br />
<br />
Raid composition will still matter to some extent, but without this change, it would have overwhelmed every other aspect of raid planning (as we added new capabilities to each of 30 different talent trees). You no longer need to rigidly control the melee/spellcaster balance of your raid, or make sure every group has all the critical buffing classes, etc. This change has many class balance implications.<br />
<br />
IMPORTANT! Before we are done, we will thoroughly test the performance of every class. It should not be assumed that one class' current performance relative to others in beta is final. Some classes (and specializations) will need to be reduced in power and some increased. Many may feel the change has more impact on class X than class Y. We will address all of those concerns via our internal testing and community feedback.<br />
<br />
There are thirty or so different categories into which buffs and debuffs fit. Here you will find a comprehensive list of the changes made broken down by category and which spells/talents are in that category. <br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
In each category, you can only benefit from the most powerful spell granting that effect. For example, Fel Intelligence grants spirit and intellect, both weaker than Arcane Intellect and Divine Spirit. If a player has Fel Intelligence and receives a stronger Arcane Intellect buff, he will gain the intellect value from Arcane Intellect and the spirit value from Fel Intelligence.<br />
<br />
In most cases, fully-talented players will have exactly equal power on the strength of these buffs and debuffs. Fel Intelligence is an example of where one ability is weaker than others. The buffs in the &quot;Increased Spell Power Buff&quot; category are also not all the same potency, as they scale and grow in radically different ways. In virtually every other case, however, the buffs are equal. This means, for example, that fully-talented Battle Shout and Blessing of Might now grant the exact same amount of attack power.<br />
<br />
In addition to this change, we also needed to address the &quot;mana battery&quot; roles in a raid. The mana regeneration effect they grant is no longer limited to their own party, and it no longer depends on the amount of damage they deal. Each time they trigger the mana regeneration effect, 10 people in their raid group will receive a buff which causes them to regenerate 0.5% of their maximum mana each second. This buff, Replenishment, will be given preferentially to raid members with the lowest mana, but will re-evaluate which raid members receive it each time it is fired. Replenishment is provided by Shadow Priests, Survival Hunters, and Retribution Paladins.<br />
<br />
Finally, we have modified Heroism and Bloodlust to affect the entire raid. However, all affected raid members will be unable to cast or benefit from Bloodlust/Heroism for 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
Below you will find a list of the changes to abilities which exhibit new behavior regardless of the exclusive categories. The changes usually mean the old behavior was removed and replaced by the new behavior. Numbers listed are for maximally-talented versions. Here is that list of changes: <br />

<br />
but as a mage i have a question, does this means only one school of spells can enjoy the benefits during a raid fight? (etc, there are one deep fire mage and one deep frost mage, but there is only winterchill or Improved Scorch can effect on boss)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varithorn1</div><div class="date">2008-08-29, 02:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Lemuever17. But this is a negative change, here me out. Many cool new abilities were implemented that really get affected by this, such as Earth and Moon, Icy Talons, and the new Rampage. It is almost a guarantee that this will cause some classes to be needed more than others, creating raid imbalance and possible uselessness of certain specs. Blizzard said they wanted it so that you wouldn't need a set group of 25 people (or 10 people) for raids aside from healers and tanks, but this makes it so that some classes will see very few raids due to buffing mechanics. If the second &quot;TBA Bleed&quot; is better than the arms warrior Blood Frenzy, it is gg for them in PvE. So, in conclusion, this is a silly idea, and makes a bunch of neat talents useless.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Another thing is, if certain classes can't contribute leet utilities to make up for lower dps, than they won't be needed ever for raids, if someone else brings the same utility with more dps.</div></div><hr />

Shadow Weaving = Self Buff only <br />
VT = Nerfed. Equal to Ret Pallys and or Survival Hunters <br />
<br />
So with less utility than a Ret Pally, Survival Hunter, or Boonkin then why bring a Shadow Priest? <br />
<br />
Are Shadow Priests being nerfed out of the raid and sent back to PvP? Certainly seems that way...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I certainly pity the Warlocks who wanted to raid as Affliction though, or the Priests who wanted to raid as Disc.<br />
<br />
Also, Moonkins just won the lottery in their avalanche of raid buffs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your Scorch spells have a 100% chance to cause your target to be vulnerable to Fire, Frost and Arcane damage, increasing damage taken by 2% and lasts 30 sec. Stacks up to 5 times.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gives your Frost damage spells a 33% chance to apply the Winter's Chill effect, which increases the chance Arcane, Fire and Frost spells will critically hit the target by 2% for 15 sec. Stacks up to 5 times.<br />
<br />
is that means we can still have two mages in one raid?</div></div><hr />

Shadow Weaving = Self Buff only <br />
VT = Nerfed. Equal to Ret Pallys and or Survival Hunters <br />
<br />
So with less utility than a Ret Pally, Survival Hunter, or Boonkin then why bring a Shadow Priest? <br />
<br />
Are Shadow Priests being nerfed out of the raid and sent back to PvP? Certainly seems that way... <br />
<br />
<br />
Indeed; unless big changes are made shadowpriests are now OBSOLETE.<br />
<br />
For those that didnt know Shadowpriests brought 4 raid utility/buffs in BC:<br />
<br />
- Misery (now obsolete as boomkins bring a debuff more than 2 times better, and have imp faerie fire which does exactly what the new misery does)<br />
- Shadow Weaving (now only buffs yourself, NOONE ELSE IN THE RAID)<br />
- Vampiric Touch (now given to hunters and retridins)<br />
- Vampiric Embrace (no news as of yet)<br />
<br />
So 3/4 of our raid buffs have been smashed to pieces then s**ted on.<br />
<br />
Would you take a shadowpriest WHO CANNOT BUFF THE RAID IN ANY WAY; or a survival hunter/ retridin who have a wealth of raid buffs ALONG SIDE the mana utility that made shadowpriests unique?<br />
<br />
Yes, unless vampiric embrace gets a buff (more than just raid-wide) shadowpriests will not be taken to raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Raid composition will still matter to some extent, but without this change, it would have overwhelmed every other aspect of raid planning (as we added new capabilities to each of 30 different talent trees). You no longer need to rigidly control the melee/spellcaster balance of your raid, or make sure every group has all the critical buffing classes, etc. This change has many class balance implications.&quot;<br />
<br />
I somehow got feeling this will lead in ridicilously easy encounters in wotlk or other way they could go with this is that all classes, so called old &quot;heavy utilitys&quot; will be almost on toe to toe with the traditional heavy dps classes dps wise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure I may be locked into the Warrior train of thinking, whereby half our talents seem to counter what our class is meant to be about... but this seems plum daft.

This doesn't really cover the +spell dmg requirement unless you have the warlock as demo. Obviously Demonic Pact and Totem of Wrath are going to be the best things in those categories. You could also have a Fury Warrior instead of a Feral druid. Also Spirit isn't covered unless you have an aff lock or a disc priest, though that buff is a lot more minor.</div></div><hr />

I fail to see how you see these as a big buffs? Only i thing i can come up is that you need to stack less hybrids to get the max amount of buffs. Relative raid dmg propably will go down what it is now and what it will be compared to the gear lvl upgrade and 10 levels.</div></div><hr />

Really.<br />
What are you people crying about?<br />
Dumbing down the game?<br />
<br />
A dumb game is a game that lets you form a raid based on what classes give the most utility and dps.<br />
A smart game is a game that lets you form a raid based on player skills, where classes that share the same amount of utility also have equal DPS-potential.<br />
<br />
Shadow priests aren't dead because there's no reason taking a retadin or a surv hunter if you can provide better DPS, which is now possible because as I said, DPS potential is based on your raid utility.<br />
<br />
Instead of throwing shit at every change in this game, be it big or small, remember that QQing will get you nowhere by the fact that it's changed, PERIOD, and you can do nothing about it, so you better start embracing that fact, understand that it's actually a good change, love it, and keep playing the fucking game.<br />
If you can't, just quit.<br />
<br />
Changes these big aren't made to anger the players, they are made to make them happier, so players would keep playing and pay subscription fee so Blizzard could get more money.<br />
And Blizzard is really good at getting more money.<br />
So even you really really honestly truly think this change is teh sux, people will still play just as much if not more as they did before that change.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to make you guys angrier, I'm just trying to explain to you that Blizzard simply won't do such a drastic change in game mechanics unless they were absolutely sure it's a better, more profitable solution.<br />
I'm not saying they're always doing stuff right, obviously. They still have a lot of phail history, but was mainly on PTRs and eventually every content patch was completely cleaned of phails (that's what PTRs are for), and the game you play now is the combined result of all those patches. And there wasn't any point in the game where it saw a downfall because of a big bad change in some content patch. That's because Blizzard is a good company, they wouldn't let such a big change make it into such a big patch unless it was clearly an upgrade.<br />
<br />
So by reading that post in the front page you can easily realize that it's not just a thing Blizzard is testing to see if it's actually a better solution. It's a mechanic that WILL be implemented in 3.0.X, and it wouldn't be if if Blizzard didn't think it's good. And what Blizzard thinks is good = is also good for you, whether it takes you days or months to realize that. Because most of you will keep playing, even Shadow Priests :P, and you will still have fun playing despite your furious QQs, and believe me, after this change you will have more fun.</div></div><hr />

Well, judging by the way it's written, it's not a mechanic to be tested on the PTR/Beta and then removed/changed/tweaked based on feedback. It's something that will go live no matter what.<br />
<br />
And it would be a lie to say that I'm not a casual, but I'm still raiding alot, and probably gonna get my 5th T6 item soon. So I KNOW how you and the other guys feel, I felt the same way initially, but instead of thinking how your raid utility got nerfed, think of how other specs' utilities got buffed to now compare to how imba you are. This does make you less imba now, but that's just to let other people enjoy the game by getting them some raid spots which were ninja'd by utility classes like you.<br />
<br />
So opening spots for the previously underdog specs is indeed GOOD.<br />
Thinking of it as bad because you are less wanted now is SELFISH.</div></div><hr />

Apart from the fact that it`s still not balanced. All this will change it will make certain classes UN-usable unless they go over with some drastic changes.<br />
<br />
What really happened here. Blizzard has to rush the 3.0 on live servers cause WAR is about to be published. And they couldnt balance out certain problem classes in time so they came up with this bullshit. I mean week or 2 ago they reworked imp scorch for fire tree and now they make it indentical with frost tree one? This idea has to be pretty fresh and doesnt seem too well thought out if im honest.</div></div><hr />

Really.<br />
What are you people crying about?<br />
Dumbing down the game?<br />
<br />
A dumb game is a game that lets you form a raid based on what classes give the most utility and dps.<br />
A smart game is a game that lets you form a raid based on player skills, where classes that share the same amount of utility also have equal DPS-potential.<br />
<br />
Shadow priests aren't dead because there's no reason taking a retadin or a surv hunter if you can provide better DPS, which is now possible because as I said, DPS potential is based on your raid utility.<br />
<br />
Instead of throwing shit at every change in this game, be it big or small, remember that QQing will get you nowhere by the fact that it's changed, PERIOD, and you can do nothing about it, so you better start embracing that fact, understand that it's actually a good change, love it, and keep playing the fucking game.<br />
If you can't, just quit.<br />
<br />
Changes these big aren't made to anger the players, they are made to make them happier, so players would keep playing and pay subscription fee so Blizzard could get more money.<br />
And Blizzard is really good at getting more money.<br />
So even you really really honestly truly think this change is teh sux, people will still play just as much if not more as they did before that change.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to make you guys angrier, I'm just trying to explain to you that Blizzard simply won't do such a drastic change in game mechanics unless they were absolutely sure it's a better, more profitable solution.<br />
I'm not saying they're always doing stuff right, obviously. They still have a lot of phail history, but was mainly on PTRs and eventually every content patch was completely cleaned of phails (that's what PTRs are for), and the game you play now is the combined result of all those patches. And there wasn't any point in the game where it saw a downfall because of a big bad change in some content patch. That's because Blizzard is a good company, they wouldn't let such a big change make it into such a big patch unless it was clearly an upgrade.<br />
<br />
So by reading that post in the front page you can easily realize that it's not just a thing Blizzard is testing to see if it's actually a better solution. It's a mechanic that WILL be implemented in 3.0.X, and it wouldn't be if if Blizzard didn't think it's good. And what Blizzard thinks is good = is also good for you, whether it takes you days or months to realize that. Because most of you will keep playing, even Shadow Priests :P, and you will still have fun playing despite your furious QQs, and believe me, after this change you will have more fun.<br />

<br />
It's also impossible to say that any class will get shafted before all the class changes get finalized.<br />
<br />
These changes also in no way make it easier to balance raids, at least for those of us in the hardcore camp, as each raid buff/debuff slot should have the BEST of that slot available.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, encounters with multiple bosses (Thad), or bosses with a lot of adds (Kel), mean that you'll benefit from having multiple classes that share a debuff slot.<br />
<br />
Classes that are seeing nerfs to their raid utility will probably see their dps increase quite a bit. Classes gaining more utility might see their dps drop.<br />
<br />
If WotLK progression is anything like TBC progression it will also mean that spec desirability will change for each raiding tier; i.e. mage's frost-fire-frost-fire in TBC, with arcane somewhere in there at some point I recall.<br />
<br />
Though what do I know? I'm a healer, and those are always needed. :P<br />
<br />
Edit addendum:<br />
<br />
These changes also greatly benefit small guilds who desire to go with 10-man progression. Damn casuals, getting their casual buffs.</div></div><hr />

You could however imagine a raid with a feral and a pala tank, or dk for that matter and a rogue in raid so expose armor would have some benefit there.<br />

Sounds about right for a 10 man raid, and add a few extras to fill out dead people I guess on the 25 man raids - and no it won't fix it for the major raid guilds, but will bring alternatives for smaller guilds overall.</div></div><hr />

Well, the aim is to have several &quot;best combination&quot;s, so to be more correct let me fix myself and say: they will form the rest of the raid based on who they want to play with, after they have one of the best raid combination.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Currently if you need a particular niche filled you have to either have someone exactly the right class and spec, or you have to recruit from outside of those you already know.<br />
<br />
These changes mean that with your current raiding guild, any raids that require different raid makeups you can probably fill with your current guild membership. And reducing the number of specific utility specs mean those who are extra can be whomever you currently have online. It takes a huge headache out of the equation for raid leaders trying to fill a raid. Minor respecs can suffice, as the gear is getting homogenized a bit.<br />
<br />
It eliminates the raid day where all of x class/spec is absent, so you can't raid even though 35 raiders are online, or your raid synergy blows so nobody can min-max to their fullest. Just one example.<br />
<br />
I imagine they will attempt to balance dps so no one class far out-dpses another. Hybrid classes doing roughly similar dps (maybe differing on specific encounters or instances), and pure dps classes doing reasonable amount more.</div></div><hr />

I think these changes made hybrid classes more or less obsolete. You no longer need to stack up hybrid classes for support, so there is no reason to bring them along any more (except those you need to cover the buff/debuffs, which will be very few).<br />
If they balance every class which is supposed to do damage (even the hybrid classes that dont fill a support role any longer) to make roughly the same dps this change would make more sense. Though the game would become even more dumb...</div></div><hr />

really. on the past 6 pages virtually every class stated that it was dead because its place will be taken by class X (which did QQ too)<br />
don't you get it?<br />
if you haven't been a total ass to your guild (which I assume you must have, because you fear for your raid slot) they will take you anyways. you really think there'll suddenly fall 200 class Y players (whichever class you fear will make most dps) out of the clear blue sky and take all your precious raid slots and lovely epix?<br />

a) This is dumbing down the game?<br />
b) This is appealing to casuals?<br />
<br />
As far as I can see, stacking a raid with certain classes for certain buffs is not an indication of skill or hardcore status. Blizzard's stated aim for this change is to allow raids to take players with skill over players with a specific buff that is required for min/maxing. I have no issue with arguments over whether they have achieved that goal or not, but most of the comments here seem more along the lines of &quot;OMG my particular class/spec is now dead, it's the end of the world&quot; or &quot;OMG Blizzard catering to the casual&quot;. Seems to me this change does the opposite- if you're a casual who sucks at their class you're not going to get carried into a raid any more because you bring the one buff the raid needs to beat a particular boss. Surely that's a good thing that acts in the favour of hardcore raid guilds?<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm missing something, but if someone can enlighten me I'm prepared to change my mind...</div></div><hr />

<br />
So with less utility than a Ret Pally, Survival Hunter, or Boonkin then why bring a Shadow Priest? <br />

This is the beginning of making the diffrent classes more and more the same, removing unique abilities, or giving them to other classses aswell. Whats unique about your class if other class has the same with diffrent look and diffrent name but doing the same. <br />
Now all former support classes do dps as dps classes and dps classes support as support classes. Dmbing down and &quot;flaten&quot; down the classes is just an easy way to balance stuff out...</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. -5% dmg because of misery, -3% beacuse no one will use curse of elements anymore, -2-5% becaus eimp shadowbolt is limited to wl's. So the base DPS of Shadow's is probably increased by 10-15% in a raid now. (instead of 25% yesterday)<br />
2. the DPS of the other classes has also increased!<br />
<br />
Then for gilfanon: <br />
<br />
1. This is dumping down the game, because the support in the raid isn't relied on skill anymore, neither on theorycraft. So you can just put a raid togehter with 25 &quot;casual's&quot; and have a brillant supported setup.<br />
2. This change isn't a benefit for everyone. Mages for example got overpowered, and wl's just nerfed. Sp's are just a lost slot to a raid. Instead of balancing, this change is debalancing everything. The classes were better balanced in the Beta before this idea was upcoming.</div></div><hr />

Yeah untill we start raiding. If you look at our talents NOTHING has been done to increase our scaling.

<br />
1. This is dumping down the game, because the support in the raid isn't relied on skill anymore, neither on theorycraft. So you can just put a raid togehter with 25 &quot;casual's&quot; and have a brillant supported setup.<br />
2. This change isn't a benefit for everyone. Mages for example got overpowered, and wl's just nerfed. Sp's are just a lost slot to a raid. Instead of balancing, this change is debalancing everything. The classes were better balanced in the Beta before this idea was upcoming. <br />
<br />
<br />
1. Raid utility has never required being casual or hardcore. (There are a few exceptions: VT, EW, etc) Maximizing DPS/Healing has been a hardcore trait, and will be required even more, now that you can't come to a raid simply because you have a particular utility.<br />
<br />
2. This isn't even an answer to his question, and classes are still being balanced and rebalanced.</div></div><hr />

How about you all SHUT THE F*** UP UNTIL YOU HAVE AN IDEA OF HOW MUCH DPS YOUR CLASS WILL BE DOING!?<br />
Seriously, I didn't think it was possible to be so bloody clueless as you people demonstrate in this thread.<br />
<br />
Allow me to explain:<br />
Your utility goes down, your DPS goes up.<br />
See? Simple.<br />
If this turns out not to be true, then your class is broken and you should submit constructive feedback to Blizzard upon reaching Lv80 and trying out raids with people of similar gear quality to you.<br />
<br />
DO NOT mindlessly flame Blizzard for the change, when you don't know how it will work.<br />
DO NOT whine that a Retribution Paladin wearing T7 outdps you in your Of the Sorcerer/Bandit greens.<br />
DO NOT simply expect to hit one button and be top DPS.<br />
<br />
A DPS spec that also provides utility should have equal DPS to eachother, but below pure DPS classes that offer little or no utility (especially little utility that requires them to stop DPSing).<br />
<br />
<br />
How many times have you sat in a raid group, waiting for 30 minutes while the officers discuss how to group up the healers and the magical ranged DPS classes. &quot;Ok we have a SPriest and a Resto Shaman in that group, so they can get haste when the healing needs to happen faster + infinite mana. The other SPriest should go in THAT DPS group.&quot; then your raid members whine &quot;OMFG WHY DON'T I GET THE MOONKIN I WANT THE CRIT FFZ&quot;.<br />
Etcetera.<br />
<br />
With this change, the little min/maxing still remaining will be done before raid invites are handed out, and groups can be pretty much the order in which they are invited.<br />
If a Retribution Paladin and a Shadow Priest have signed up, then the raid leader can either invite both, or look at which of them does the most DPS (because both of their utilities are done automatically while doing damage) and invite the best player.<br />
<br />
How can this not be a good change?<br />
If you end up finding yourself repeatedly not invited to raids, then you should ask your raid leader why this is. If you consistently do less DPS than the other utility class, then you need to either get better at your class, fix your gems/enchants, or find a guild that is doing content relative to your gear.<br />
<br />
Are you so selfish that you want, nay, DEMAND a raid spot just because you provide a certain utility, all the while your DPS is relative to a critter?<br />
If you answer yes to this question, then I am glad you are not in my guild.<br />
<br />
<br />
That being said, I am unsure about the changes to Judgements of the Wise.<br />
In solo and PvP content, that spell essentially meant infinite mana. I can completely understand how this is too powerful, but I'm just not sure about how long we can in fact last with this new version of it, and how fast the mana will regenerate.<br />
I can do nothing but wait for the PTR, because this needs testing :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hardcore guilds (and I mean those going for world firsts) will do min/maxing no matter what Blizzard would do, so their players might reroll/recruit some different classes. For the rest of us, this will simplify raid composition. No more denying good players cos their class is redundant to raid buffs.<br />
<br />
Obviously this means that classes that bring buffs will have their DPS increased, and as far as I know, Blizzard haven't yet begun balacing classes' DPS at 80 in raid environments.<br />

<br />
<br />
What the hell are you going on about?<br />
<br />
1- Raid support never, ever was skill based. You just needed to pick some classes for their buffs/debuffs and have them using them when you yelled over Vent for them to do it. Closest you get to this is Shadow Priests, as their damage was proportional to the mana granted - This really makes little difference as you STILL want to be doing as much damage as possible.<br />
<br />
2- A LOT of people benefit from this, but ultimately raids are the ones that benefit the most. I know that every raid out there has faced the issue of a key member for a particular fight suddenly gone missing or unavailable for that day, and almost bringing the raid to a halt for that day or severely complicating things. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This change is largely for the best, and most of you are just being the same idiotic crybaby strand that every time a change is made go &quot;ALL IS LOST&quot; and start running in circles with your hands waving in the air. Then when you actually get to try this stuff, you see how it makes sense and doesn't break the game altogether and makes it unplayable or makes your class completely useless like you had previously feared.<br />
<br />
This virtual genetic mutation of retarded buttbabies that clog all WoW message boards have been since day 1, heralding the DOOM of their virtual enjoyment, yet they still play, love it, and probably couldn't live without it - they just need the drama like soap-opera addicts.<br />

As said before, raids will be less dependant on buffs and more on friendship.<br />
<br />
Our guild is a small one and we tend to base more on 10 man content and sometimes go for a 25 man raid. In our usual 10 man raid we tend to sometimes have problems due to missing buffs and this seems the solution for us.<br />
<br />
As for when we run 25 man, i do also see this as a good thing as not all our players are 100% speced just for raids.<br />
<br />
And for the hardcore raiders, don't worry guys and gals. You will still have ur content to beat and I am sure things will all be balanced out at the end.<br />

Yeah well im happy when i see the talent trees fixed but they come with changes like this from nowhere. And as you stated you will pick utility class with highest dps, So blizzard has to balance dps on the same level, but even futher every class has to scale same way so they get same benefit from every attribute or when the raiding tier changes you gotta reset your whole raid setup and remove utility class X from raid cause utility class Y just outscaled him in this tier content badly and propably is going to do it even more when the next tier steps in.<br />
<br />
I really fail to see how this allows you to pick best players? Worlds worst T6 rogue will easily out dps Worlds best prot warrior. Thats pure math, build in class feature (I know it`s not same raidspot but this is just to point out every class got their limits tho some classes got bit higher limits than others). Differences won`t be that drastic but as long there are different classes build around same task one will rise above due to better class mechanics.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sharandris</div><div class="date">2008-08-29, 08:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think these changes are good, and I am a raidleader (which doesn't mean I am right of course).<br />
<br />
Problem number one while organizing a raid is managing your player pool. Normally, you want to have something between a &quot;3 people for 2 spots&quot; and &quot;4 people for 3 spots&quot; rotation.<br />
However currently, there are around 6 non-tanking specs which aren't really worth stacking:<br />
<br />
Survival Hunter<br />
Moonkin<br />
MS Warrior<br />
Retribution Paladin<br />
Enhancement Shaman<br />
Elemental Shaman<br />
<br />
Of course, bringing two of some MIGHT work in some setups but that's a rare case.<br />
This problem has a huge affect on the player pool. Having one of them in your pool means you have to rely on this person. Having 2 leads to a 50% attendance - often with a lot of switching between those two because of key loot like e.g. for the torch from RoS for your ret paladins.<br />
<br />
The new system makes this easier. It will be still hard to get the 100% support but I am more confident to get 80-90% each raid - losing your 3rd shaman won't be so bad then like it is now.<br />
Therefore, player rotations can be much more flexible - I probably won't fall below a certain amount of support when a key role is missing one evening because there is some backup now and swapping casters for melees isn't a thing mages and rogues have to handle alone.<br />
<br />
People are crying now because they fear that there will be just one raidspot for them - actually, this makes you even with speccs like ret who are facing this already. I agree that the new way of min-maxing may be even more unfair but it's also harder to perform and guilds doing this are already doing it now.<br />
<br />
<br />
I only fear that Blizzard isn't running out of time and starts rushing things as they did before. I can see the shadow priest problem and I bet it won't be the only one. There will be raid spot kings again like shamans are right now if Blizzard does not design carefully. If they don't, I agree this new system will make everything worse. Maybe not for the same classes and speccs like in TBC but for others.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arcalite</div><div class="date">2008-08-29, 09:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;In addition to this change, we also needed to address the &quot;mana battery&quot; roles in a raid. The mana regeneration effect they grant is no longer limited to their own party, and it no longer depends on the amount of damage they deal. Each time they trigger the mana regeneration effect, 10 people in their raid group will receive a buff which causes them to regenerate 0.5% of their maximum mana each second. This buff, Replenishment, will be given preferentially to raid members with the lowest mana, but will re-evaluate which raid members receive it each time it is fired. Replenishment is provided by Shadow Priests, Survival Hunters, and Retribution Paladins.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Shadow Priest: /roll<br />
Raid: What was that?<br />
Shadow Priest: Can't I roll on that tier token?<br />
Raid: No, we need you to stack mana, thats about it, your damage doesnt matter since everything is based on .5% of the player mana. Just make sure you have enough mana to cast the entire fight.<br />
Shadow Priest: But that piece would increase my dps by 45.<br />
Raid: Who cares? 45 more dps on the 10th dps means very little to us. Stay in the corner, be a battery or we replace you with a ret paladin. You're only in the raid anyways cause you show up on the days the ret paladin doesn't. Sit back enjoy the scraps.</div></div><hr />

Okay, I haven't really covered this option. However, this isn't due to this debuff change but because of broken class design. Remember druids in Vanilla when they were brought along for innervate? They have something you cannot live without but that's it.<br />
You can't fix them by making this ability a must-have, but simply by improving their class dps wise. So stop crying about Blizz taking your support away or making it less unique, cry for class redesign instead.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now while I thought a bit about all this I guess (as long as all classes can do more or less the same dps) hardcore raids will have less stacking than casual raids.<br />
Why? Because casual raids always have this ratio of bad players. A bad warlock may do 20% less dmg than possible, but a bad ret will do 80% less than he could... Can you see the scenario I'm drawing here?</div></div><hr />

Well certain classes (read shadowpriest) have had multiple spots in raids just because their unmatched utility. Now blizzard wants to get basicly 1 of each spec in the raid. But with shared utility we gotta see supermassive boost to shadowpriest dps scaling cause not even one will be worth to bring on progression raids where you will want to have your optimal raid performance.</div></div><hr />

Before we are done, we will thoroughly test the performance of every class. It should not be assumed that one class' current performance relative to others in beta is final.

We will address all of those concerns via our internal testing and community feedback.This.<br />

If that's a true reflection of what people in your Raid Comm are like then why in the name of God are you raiding with them? Seriously, they sound like a bunch of asshats.

This example isn't based on numbers but the skill curve isn't the same for all classes.

thats great and all but i seem to remember shadow priest dps being near the top when BC came out. now its just above the tanks.<br />

so they might scale it, give us back some dps, but you know that if it is above certain classes they'll whine and we'll get nerfed again. im not saying they should be the top by any means (rogues should, otherwise they are completely useless) but we shouldnt be 8-10% below everyone else</div></div><hr />

<br />
for example the melee group. every raid has no more than one melee group. now with the introduction of the death knight the melee group has become very full. 1 rog 1 ret pali 1 warrior 1 deathknight 1 shami would be the resault if the raid wide buffs would not be. seeing you have more than one of each class in ur guild you would have to rotate alot which makes the class officer life very hard.<br />

You dont think the debuff mechanics on the 4 horsemen fight will be different between 10 and 25 players?<br />
How about sapphiron, will he curse a % of the raid or a flat number like 7, decent for a 25 man raid, shitty for a 10 man raid<br />

<br />
I see what Blizz are trying to do, and I understand it and like it to some degree, but the way it's described here, isn't this dangerously close to pretty much wrecking the raid viability for classes/specs that were based on utility/buffing?<br />
<br />
I'm gonna take Retribution Paladin as an example because that's what I play (based on BC). My DPS is not bad.... but it's never higher than the middle grounds on the meters, often lower. The only reason I would be invited is because I add something ELSE that no one else can, some buffs and utility you can't get elsewhere. I was content with this - I don't care about the meters, only that I get invites.<br />
Now that you can get those buffs from pure DPS classes, wouldn't it make more sense for a dedicated raid leader to warm up the bench for me, give me a soda and a pat on the back as I sit down? Again. And again.<br />
<br />
I understand I'm taking this slightly in a BC context, and I understand they're not done tweaking the classes. But I also understand that the Paladin is currently at the top of DPS and will likely be nerfed substantially.<br />
<br />
All I'm saying is that I hope they wont nerf it a lot so we're still an almost top DPS class (in LK rather than how it is in BC), if they're taking our utility and buffs and spreading it around generously.<br />
<br />
<br />
Note: I know other buff classes/specs are just as &quot;harmed&quot;, I'm just taking ret because it's what I know from BC raiding.</div></div><hr />

1. Paladins haven't been passed through polish, and their dps has been stated to be reduced.<br />
2. You are wrong about many things that I won't even bother touching on. What I find most fun to read is the fact that you complain about BoM &gt; BS when max rank BoM is 350 and max rank BS is 550. Which lands them at 525 for Imp BoM and 605 for Imp BS.</div></div><hr />

Lol - really ... 10 man encounters will be balanced with as many of these classes as possible. Arms Warrior.... is taking the spot away from rogue for 100% sure. 2 shamans will join for OTHER reasons than buffs... Heroism anyone ? This has NOT prevented 25 man raids for stacking shamans for now EXTRA RAIDWIDE rotations of Powerups...<br />
<br />
But the main reason that Blizzard is naming for doing this is simply just wrong. Play with friends rather than finding the right specs ? Oh really .... Ever thought that your friends might be of the SAME class and SAME spec ???? <br />
<br />
This will change NOTHING !! Other than the fact that ALL raids will require CERTAIN classes 100% and you will NOT be able to raid without those classes. And having 2 of those specs in the same guild like atm (for switching) is NOT possible atm. If anything this actually calls for MORE need to have certain classes online for every single encounter. And yuo dont have backupst cause ... they can't get into the raid regularly IF the other person of same spec is there....<br />
<br />
This really is a joke....<br />
<br />
If ever there was a reason to test out WAR - then this is it....<br />
<br />
Unless Rogues' personal performance is nerfed to be on par with the other classes, Rogues will be overly stacked in 25-mans for the simple reason that the other classes pay personal performance to be allowed to buff - and now those buffs are more easily gotten with fewer people.<br />
<br />

but with 3 shammy in the raid, if a fight lasts more than 10 minutes, you get 3 heroisms for the ENTIRE raid. i dont think many people are too upset about the heroism change. just use bl at a different spot, then your drums at another and youll have a haste buff for good portions of the fight</div></div><hr />

None of them. Everyone's in shell shock after this. There are a few specs that are curiously left untouched (by this change).<br />

<br />
me too i think the .5% raidmana is BS. not scaling with the dps of the mana-battery class makes mana-battery less desirable to gear well.<br />
<br />
that aside. changes are coming. and for the people crying that this is a fast shot: blizz has stated long ago that there will come raidwide buffs, and that of course they then need to look into stacking, and that they don't wont class sticking of class X to be the uber way to go.</div></div><hr />

People will stay, they'll get used to the changes within some weeks and &quot;the end of the world&quot; will not be here.<br />
Sure the changes aren't 100% for the best and it will make raiding a bit more casual, but saying a large amount of the hardcore playerbase will move to warhammer is just bullshit. Warhammer Online will be a PVP/RVR based game, which obviously is a lot different from the more PVE based WOW.<br />
<br />
Sure Warhammer Online might actually get 1-2 million players the first month, simply because it's not as buggy as Age of Conan and it has a more RVR based gameplay which is different, but WOW will easily stand up against it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Will warlocks dots stack?<br />
<br />
Hate to break it to you, but Rogues weren't exactly lacking in spots due to being the class that benefited the most from stacking buffs and doing the most personal performance. Mages and Hunters were lacking, but usually got slotted in for sheeping and kiting.<br />
<br />
Of course Warlock dots will stack! Will several Rogues hitting the same target over-rule each other's damage? No! Will two Paladins with the same aura near each other spontaneously explode? Well... probably not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
personally, changes to my eleshaman arent that good :/ <br />
flat +dmg on ToW? wut? 6% increase was way better and it atleast scaled, now its just flametnogue totem v2.0<br />
second part of ToW... enemies within totem raidus have 3% bigger chance to being critted? what the hell is that? now i am supposed to not buff just raid with totem, but also enemies? as if micromanagement with totems wasnt bad enough already<br />
elemental oath 5%crit to raid... wha?? basically this skill simply overwrite with ANOTHER hybrid caster, moonkin? not good imo<br />
<br />
still, we will probably stack with moonkins very well, even with EO changed, we can still be on the other sides of raid, boosting all the raid, while he is providing EaM and imp. FF, while we are providing 3% crit to ALL if ToW is placed correctly and additional flat +dmg<br />
<br />
now only think i wanna see, is making WoA like 3% untalented and adding to lightning mastery per rank 0,5-1% of haste on top, that way WoA will be better in hands of eleshaman, making them more desirable to take<br />
<br />

It's a beta. If we don't whine (which for less conflict oriented persons should be read as &quot;give feedback&quot;) the devs won't get the information they need, and the risk of poor changes is bigger.<br />

No, even Blizzard can't afford to pay for the gross amount of testing that a major patch need in order to balance classes. Don't be silly. Only the community it is aimed for is effective at abusing the changes to their maximum extent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Smells like a Hemorrhage change or something like that as I don't see Hemorrhage listed yet.<br />
<br />
By the way, this will probably be the end of Rogues/BM Hunters dominating the DPS charts by a few hundred DPS, as the buffs/debuffs become more like a &quot;standard&quot; and this would make the raid setups even more important than now.<br />
Imagine what'd happen if the classes' DPS stay like they are now but the utility changes are implemented, for Patchwerk the best raid setup would be something like 6 Healers/1 Feral/1 Prot Paladin/1 Blood|Frost Tank DK/1-16 Hunters/0-15 Rogues. They'll probably give Rogues a bit of utility like they did for Warlocks to make them as &quot;needed&quot; as the other supporters and make every classes DPS around equal so you don't go with 5 Supporters and 10-15 &quot;pure&quot; DDs.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Strict class requirements for 10 man raid groups have been removed. Take any of your 9 friends, head into a dungeon and have fun. Also, we nerfed the ridiculoussness that was round-the-clock Bloodlust.&quot;<br />

<br />
soon enough theorycrafting sites will figure out the minimal amount of specs/classes to bring to cover most buffs and we'll see the rest of the spots given to the wotlk-equivalent of warlocks and rogues.<br />
<br />
less buff stacking = less spots for utility classes = more spots for pure dps classes stacking<br />
<br />
as an example, if these changes would have happened in TBC, we would have seen more than 5 locks and 5 rogues in each raid with some healers,tanks and minimal utility classes... and the more buffs that can be covered by healers/tanks the more warlocks and rogues we can bring!<br />
<br />
this is gonna fail horribly unless they give utility classes a big dps boost as well (which is contrary to what they expressed when they addressed the issue of mages doing less dps than warlocks, a utility class, in tbc)</div></div><hr />

This is why it doesn't stack, you don't have to have a certain spec, others can bring the same utility.<br />
<br />
On that note, i'm curious to see the class balancing patchnotes before i declare this change good/bad.<br />
<br />
Blizzard would have to balance hybrid dps to the same dps as &quot;pure&quot; dps if they want to achieve their goals. Which is that any player can join the raid, not that specific class spec etc. Which is probably a bad thing.</div></div><hr />

I'm not going to sit on here and b**ch about quitting, but it makes no sense to me why EVERY class needs to have overwriting buffs.

<br />
another way would be, that hybrid specific buffs (ToW or eleoath, IMkA or EaM, Misery, dunno what retripaladins got) would be excluded out of these, so it would stll be worth to bring them to raid for those buffs, which would be now build specific, so we could still take pure dps classes, which have other buffs same as dps hybrids, but allowing hybrids to have unique buff, it would still be prolly 2 ppl from pure dps class and 1 from dps hybrid..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thinking about this whole thing back and forth I now believe this is the only thing that matters.<br />
Yes, there are people who play this game without building up a social network inside the game. However, I highly doubt that this is the majority of players.<br />
I learned that the so-called casuals are in much more often in such social relations inside the game than hardcore players are. This was different in Vanilla, but hey, THIS isn't Vanilla anymore.<br />
<br />
However, there are still a lot of raiders who want to be successful and therefore try to keep a certain anonymity. They may have their 3 friends or something, but they like to keep it that way. You don't kick a friend out of your raid because he sucks, do you?<br />
These people tend to be raid leaders quite often and yes, these people start to come up with this min maxing sh*t again. What do you want to do against this? Even if the game were completely balanced, those people would find something different to base their decisions on. They already do: 16? Too young. 35? Too old. Can never raid on Sundays? Fail.<br />
You may change your class or spec, but you can't fool much about age when you told it once, do you?<br />
<br />
So in the end, you simply have to avoid those raids. Go find yourself a bunch of friends. The whole game was beaten without stacking. Don't tell me you have to do it.<br />
<br />
And never forget: If you want a raid spot and you are a good player then you will get one. If you don't, you are not able to write a proper application.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its like the potion changes a while back, &quot;the sky is falling&quot; wait no its not, you just can't stack everything.<br />
All this adds is group flexibility so don't need certain classes to do certain encounters, any &quot;utility&quot; classes will have they damage raised to match the others<br />
<br />
&quot;Before we are done, we will thoroughly test the performance of every class. Do not assume that the classes' current performance relative to others in the beta is final. Some classes (and specializations) will need to be reduced in power and some increased&quot;<br />
<br />
Shadow Priests aren't dead, they just aren't required for there regeneration anymore which opens up spaces for others.<br />
<br />
A few of the buff changes are a little odd but its hard to comment when we haven't seen the whole set of patch notes yet<br />
<br />
psycow there is still seperate MeleeHit and Spellhit stats but the gear only has a Hit stat which increases both.</div></div><hr />

Look at fury warriors now. Do you think a rogue will still be king of dps? No, all classes will be able to put out the exact same dps, given similar gear and skill levels.<br />

Some classes will contribute buffs, some will contribute CC, some will get nifty soloing and PvP stuff, but they will all put out the same amounts of damage.<br />
<br />
Do you really have such little faith in blizzard that they would allow scenarios where you would WANT to fill your raids with three buffers and debuffers, five healers, two tanks and fifteen rogues?<br />
<br />
Nope, I bet we'll be seeing a whole lot more changes in numerical dps values in the future, resulting in a whooooole lot of rogue whine claiming they are &quot;the kings of melee dps&quot;. WoW goes communism-style. We all contribute the same amount of DPS, there's no top or bottom to this, it'll come down to skill. Afraid, much?<br />
<br />
At least, that's what I think Blizzard is thinking.</div></div><hr />

Tbh the whine wasnt as much because of the nerf of stacking back then but more the fact that blizzard had said they were trying to make alchemy to a more &quot;intresting proff&quot;. Many players felt cheated afterwards.<br />
<br />
This is really really the easy way out changes(the stacking nerf) Blizzard couldve really found something better way to fix it. But as always *point shaman/paladin change at tbc* they choose the easiest way too deal with things because the whiners should get it as they want.</div></div><hr />

These changes also in no way make it easier to balance raids, at least for those of us in the hardcore camp, as each raid buff/debuff slot should have the BEST of that slot available.<br />

the fact is ALOT of those buffs will have same effect, blue also said it, they normalize most of the buffs so they have same value, few will remaing different, especially in spelldmg buff category, but thats it, all of them same = in next 2 days EJ will find out, what will be the optimal makeup of said buffs and rest will be filled with best dps classes</div></div><hr />

Thats just what I came up with fairly quick for a typical raid 25man setup.<br />
<br />
Could swap feral druid for prot pala and Arms to Fury. Ele Shammy for Moonkin etc, lots of options tbh.<br />
<br />
Just made this after reading the huge ammount of crap whine on various places. <br />
<br />
Pretty sure all the hybrids on their own add enough dmg to compete against the pure classes to even it out pretty much.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sharandris</div><div class="date">2008-08-29, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, but every &quot;ideal raid&quot; setup starting with a prot warrior is very narrow minded. Blizzard already stated that you won't need a prot warrior if you don't have one.<br />
<br />
I guess you just came up with a common raid setup, threw two DKs in, looked whether every debuff slot was covered and swapped around until it did.<br />
<br />
Thing is, Blizzard wants to PREVENT those setup plans around &quot;must-have&quot; slots (like a prot warrior) and instead wants us to invite people as we like, only judging by role they are going to fulfill (tank, heal, ranged, melee) and the class they play (2-3 of each), but still wants us to have around 80% or so of the possible support without having us wasted a thought on it.</div></div><hr />

Welcome to the social.<br />

<br />
I understand Rogue work has really yet to begin, but honestly, over the past year Rogues haven't had any real buff to their class, meanwhile all the complaining in the forums seems to garner attention from devs for most every other class/spec.<br />
<br />
I anxiously await to see what lies in the shadows for the Rogue. <br />
<br />
And not everyone here posting has even contemplated that the fights will be built around these changes. Perhaps a lot of the queuers are still trying to relate these changes to fights that are long forgotten. New changes, new fights, reworked old ones.<br />
<br />
Just shut your traps if you aren't offering advice through the in-game method. Blizzard is just changing how we play the game. Now you'll have to rework which three buttons you push. Wow.<br />

<br />
then by patch 5.0 blizzard will decide we dont really NEED tanks and healer we just need 5 dps (who ironically have auras/buffs/procs that heal them suffeciently).. <br />
<br />
then patch 6.0 where everyplayer can tank, heal, buff and dps so there will be no need for groups..</div></div><hr />

This means less reliance on the Disc Priest actually healing everyone with a direct heal before they take damage.<br />
Or simply run with 2 pure tanks and 2 hybrid tanks and skip the Disc Priest entirely so that you can tank AOE encounters as well. I'm uncertain the DPriest bring any other unique buff anyway.</div></div><hr />

You mean, every fight will be exactly the same, since with this new way of play by blizz, they can't afford fights wich could favor ranged over melees... of physical instead of spell dps... it's very obivious that with this news, would be normal to put a melee physical dps only raid and have the same chance as a ranged/spell/melee raid.<br />
<br />
Or you'll start to re-create non-desired classes/setups for each raid, wich will suck really hard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
OK, this is a response to all these sorts of posts: GET A F***ING CLUE. These changes &quot;absolutely decimate&quot; all classes, from the point of view you just gave. Guess what? That's the f***ing point. THE ENTIRE POINT OF THE CHANGE IS NOW THERE IS NO REASON TO BRING TWO OF ANYTHING, SO YOU CAN GRAB ONE OF EVERYTHING THEN GRAB YOUR FRIENDS/THE GOOD PLAYERS REGARDLESS OF CLASS OR SPEC.<br />
<br />
That's the point. THE ENTIRE POINT. You are looking at this from the point of view of your class instead of the point of view of intelligent design for a fun game. STOP.<br />
<br />
25 raid slots. 30 specs. This had to happen. There couldn't be any reason to bring two people with the same spec, that would be incredibly unfair to everyone else.</div></div><hr />

IMP FF: Causes spells cast at the target to have +3% spell hit.<br />
Earth and Moon: Increases spell damage taken from all schools by 13% on the target.<br />

<br />
They gave boomkins what the shadowpriests needed for a raid spot and buffed it.<br />
They gave HIGHER DPS/MORE RAID BUFFING classes (hunter &amp; retadin) our mana battery effect.<br />
They nerfed shadow weaving to buff only the shadowpriest himself.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shadowpriests are now pvp only.<br />
<br />
<br />
OK, I have to respond to all these too, and no by god I don't feel like reading the rest of the thread first. I'm angry and lashing out.<br />
<br />
You do realize, wait, no you don't realize. Let me start over: The only Hunter spec that gets the Shadow Priest effect is Survival. Survival is far and away the lowest DPS Hunter spec. This, combined with the only other spec getting it being Ret Paladins, completely invalidates your point.<br />
<br />
Especially since you didn't read the actual post. It was explicitly stated that some class/spec DPS would need to be buffed, and some nerfed, to balance these changes. Try reading next time, 'k? (Ironic, I know, given my first sentence).</div></div><hr />

I know that you are not presenting the only one ideal setup but people will believe there is only ONE setup. I don't think Blizzard wants everybody to go for 100% possible support but wants to make sure that even if you have no clue about raid composition you'll get about 80% possible support.<br />
<br />
Another option is that you can invite ALL your friends and not have to stop about halfway because you already know you are missing 6 key speccs and there isn't any room left.<br />
<br />
Still, people who want to do a good setup but don't have much clue have it easy nowadays: if you need manareg, you bring a shadowpriest. They do this 'math' themselves.<br />
However, in wotlk it's too complicated, so let the professionals decide what's good for us. And hello, we have the problem everybody is fearing. This is more a community than a game design issue.</div></div><hr />

Shadow Protection doesn't overwrite the paladin's shadow aura. Still you only get 70 resistance. See what I mean? I guess it will be the same with those debuffs. The actual math isn't visible through tooltips... which is actually a shame.</div></div><hr />

As it has been previously, some classes (well, more like it, speccs) have been less wanted than others in raid, such as balance druids and ret paladins. With BC theese got a chance with some guilds, ret paladins more than balance druids.<br />
<br />
Playing a balance druid myself, ive been struggling for months and months, trying to get a guild that actually would take me in their raid group.. Most just said &quot;yous dps sucks, kkthxbai&quot; or &quot;ok you do some dps, and have some buffs, but a lock/mage/random is better anyway&quot;.. Still there are raiding boomkins, as there still will be raiding shadow priests and other classes/speccs that have been nerfed.<br />
<br />
I dont think blizzard will want to push out certain classes from a raid, and also there is a reason for why they are testing stuff, both in beta with wotlk, and PTRs normally.. They make a change, does it work like intended, yes or no?<br />
<br />
If yes (after evaluating it and taken feedback in consideration), good, change can be implemented! If no, too many complains, poor class balance or other issues, then they change it again..<br />
<br />
And in the end of the day, this is a game, and its evolving all the time! If you've played for years allready, you know there has always been changes that some hate and some love, some were good and some were superfail.<br />
<br />
Still, we keep playing, for now. Why cant you just wait and see how the new changes will be before you whine (it sounds like a lot of you dont have beta keys or anything, you just whine because you like to whine).. So quit the 12 year old QQing, and give it a shot.. If it sucks, then come back and tell us and blizzard..<br />

Ret Pally DPS blows monkeydick in hell, they get taken for RAID UTILITY! Rake this away and they fucking suck.<br />

It's like Blizzard takes everyone away a status. The status, only you can buff something so you have to be invited if the class isn't in the raid, yet. <br />
<br />
I love this change. The first weeks it will be a big learning phase. What stats stack, whose don't ... But in the end, we don't need to build in a 10 man like: 5 melees / 5 caster - min. one of each class. Just invite who is online and lets go.<br />

In 25 man its even no change at all. You already had all your buffs. Now you get them all with less players. And the rest of the raid filled with 15 rogues? There will be encounters, that will punish you for stacking to much of one class (Karazhan, Maiden of Virtue with to many melees? ^^).<br />
<br />
And come on, if a class now has fewer utility, they are allowed to do more dps through changeing in class mechanics. Blizzard staff don't run with blinders.</div></div><hr />

The growing trend has always been way too many DPS, too few tanks, healers, and utility. So, we give the tanks and healers more DPS so they can do every day things without having to respec. To solve the utility aspect, they just made it so you require less of them. Rogues/hunters did a nice job crying in forums about losing their jobs to hybrids. That's what really brought the change.</div></div><hr />

- gear level for a given encounter can be determined quite precisely, giving a good idea of pre-buff stats for the whole raid. Same for consumables/enchants/gems.<br />
- class buffs and skill-stacking (as well as a few consumables like LW drums) as it is currently available allows certain stats to jump through the roof in a certain raid composition, because of both stacking and multipliers<br />
This ends up making the range of dps/hps that an encounter is tuned for quite wide, meaning encounters will either be tuned outside of optimal stacking (and thus easy for hardcore min-maxers) or tuned to be challenging with a min-maxed raid (and thus infeasible without the exact right classes and specs each evening).<br />
<br />
This change here reduces the variance in stats at a given encounter level by a lot, allowing Blizzard to fine tune difficulty a lot more while reducing raid composition constraints. ie challenging encounters for everyone that do not depend on a raid having x players of y spec to beat it.<br />
So no dumbing down nor end of hardcore raiding.<br />
<br />
--<br />
Regarding all the &quot;class X gets my buff, i'm now useless&quot;, you have to look at how that class is applying the buff/debuff and wether it's more or less practical before complaining. Keeping the +3% spell hit debuff causes moonkins to lose ~4% of their dps (1 GCD every 40s) whereas the spriest one is applied through normal dps rotation. Guess which is the best ? The spriests ones, and any moonkin will be thrilled to have an spriest with him to avoir having to insert iFF in his rotation.<br />
<br />
That being said, the change is massive and i'm not sure i like it either, but at least think a bit before QQing instead of posting crap.</div></div><hr />

As soon as Blizzard figures out how to program people like this from the game... it truly will be perfect...<br />
<br />
People you have to realize.. if you can roll one class and with a gear change and a respec.. fill 4 different roles.. you should not be able to perform any of those roles better than a class that can only perform one real job.. i.e. rogue.. mage..<br />
<br />
not to mention people can raid happily with their class intended role.. i.e. a disc priest will be an amazing healer.. and provide a very unique and interesting method of healing..<br />
<br />
to me everything looks pretty darn good.. it will be different.. but good</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sparan</div><div class="date">2008-08-29, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a little funny to me that people are calling this the end of WoW. It's funnier that people are saying that this is a move to pander to the casual majority. How many of you qqers have actually done any progression raiding? Do you really think that an important component of the difficulty of the game is being able to write up a colorful enough recruitment post somewhere to lure in enough shammies to make your raid sunwell-viable? Does having a 15-minute planning session prior to raid to see if you have the precise comp necessary to take down M'uru (not any more since he's ez-mode, but you remember how it was pre-nerf) or if you should just do BT b/c warlock #4 decided to get laid instead of raiding and mages 2-infinity are about as useful as tits on a bull? Ever had to try and scrounge up the account info on your MIA pally for that third blessing (which btw costs you 5 minutes to apply before every attempt at a prog boss b/c someone needs to log back and forth to buff it)?<br />
<br />
Blizzard's track-record at out of the gates class balance is not exactly unimpeachable (*cough* ferals in early BC *cough*), but if the stated purpose is to produce 30 raiding-viable specs for the expansion then I think until we have direct evidence that this is not happening, then we should assume that in the long run that's just what we will see. All specs aren't going to created equal, nor should anyone expect that they'll be guaranteed a raid spot in a high-end guild for playing a junk spec regardless of how good it was in BC (prot warriors are looking shaky atm, so I may well be out of a job myself). The bottom line, however, is that comments to the effect that streamlining and simplifying how raid buffs/debuffs function are dumbing the game down and putting classes out in the cold are misguided. It may be making things easier for the guy who has to do the recruiting and set up the raids (and imo that's MORE than okay, since that's a needlessly arduous task as it is now), and it may take away your license to take a raid spot every damn night on the merit of your class/spec (you poor shammies... my heart bleeds), and maybe even there's some truth to the likelihood of this change benefiting the pure dps classes most of all, but if done right this change will allow sunwell-difficulty content in terms of execution without necessitating sunwell-difficult raid planning and recruitment.</div></div><hr />

Spam chain heal (1 button) over and over and over and when I call your name click your heroism button and drums of haste...<br />
<br />
PROs The focus of the game is shifting back to skill over 'spec'. <br />
<br />
There are 10 classes and 3 specs per class - 30 unique class types - but of those 30 how many specs made it to end game raiding? (not counting gimmick fights and also not counting successful guilds that could gimp themselves by bringing a specific non optimized spec and still succeed - example holy pally).<br />
<br />
destro lock(4)<br />
enh shaman(1)<br />
resto shaman(4)<br />
prot warrior(2)<br />
holy priest(3)<br />
beast hunter(4)<br />
combat rogue(3)<br />
fire mage(1)<br />
Feral Druid(1)<br />
Shadow Priest(2)<br />
<br />
<br />
so 10 out of 30! specs - LMAO its obvious changes were needed - <br />
<br />
Sure people can argue a slight min/max or why this not that on the raid composition above but bottom line you are NOT GOING TO GET 20 more specs into this line up<br />
<br />
<br />
With the changes coming (AND YES THEY HAVE A LOT OF CLASS CHANGE WORK TO DO) this is going to be much much better and quite possibly no two end game raiding guild compositions will look anything like each other!<br />
<br />
Embrace change - imagine if nothing changed in WoW - then in order to get something new and fresh where would you go? Another MMO? yes.</div></div><hr />

I'm glad that Rogues won't be out DPS'd by lower-geared warlocks because of the buffs they can get.* I suppose it's a symptom of being in a caster-centric guild (yep, I have L2 Class'd already).<br />
<br />
It's funny that when given the right buffs, Rogues are definitely on top, but when they buffs are gone, how quickly they start to sink in the quicksand.<br />

It'll be an interesting mechanic to have a 5M cooldown on bloodlust taking effect.<br />

<br />
Yes I picked a prot warrior since well thats me :/ Figured that it was the easiest, but sure remove the Prot war for a Prot pala, you have hunters or rogues who can apply the sunder effect, druid or warlock for the demoshout and druid/pala for the clap effect.<br />
<br />
I even went as wide and mentioned several easy swaps around to get every single spec into a raid.<br />
<br />
Besides, even if we dont have one of the minor debuffs so what. I obviously dont get what everyone is so bitchy about - Do people really prefer stacking raids with shamans for lusts, destro locks for dps and warriors as main tanks?<br />
<br />
This change is exactly what wow needed, I do agree however that its a bit sad how much DK take up the same debuff/buffs as enh shammy though.<br />
The way blizz changed it allowed WAY more acceptable setups. You can still get the ohso important buffs which some classes are unavoidable for currently.<br />
<br />
<br />
Last but not least, some classes like Spriest seem to feel pretty left out, I feel quite sure though that while your support might have gone down your dps will go way up instead making you equal to others the provide the same kind of support.</div></div><hr />

But nobody is anywhere close to raiding level 80 endgame content with a shadowpriest!<br />
<br />
Not only do they have several months to balance out the fallout from this change (which is, I think, fundamentally an OK philosophical change) but it's not as though people are going to instantly jump from level 70 to level 80 endgame raiding. There won't even *be* any endgame raiding for a while after WotLK comes out. The same patches that introduce those raids can also introduce changes to help balance classes, fixing imbalances that have come to light as people leveled and progressed through dungeons and earlier raids.<br />
<br />
WoW adapts to its players just as players adapt to the game. Undoubtedly there will be some specs that are crappier than others - but which these are will change! In part, because of the experiences of the first badasses to 80, who figure out that &quot;Oh, hey, I can do 5000 DPS as an arcane mage by doing this, this, and that&quot; or whatever. Nerfbats and buffbats will be swung in response. I guarantee that the level 80 endgame shadowpriest raid experience that you're imagining bears only a passing resemblance to the level 80 endgame shadowpriest raid experience that you'll see.<br />
<br />
Of course, feedback is important. But in this case the feedback should be about the philosophy of this big change (will it make raiding harder? easier? more fun?) rather than &quot;OMGZORZ the shadowpriest is dead for endgame raiding! I'm quitting WoW!&quot;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaaviju</div><div class="date">2008-08-29, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What they just made is that they turned this game in to rogue/ hunter fest. You take few buffing classes ie. ench shaman and retri paladin and stack the rest dps spots as hunters and rogues. This change is really made in favor of the purest dps classes.<br />
<br />
<br />
A. This is fucking retarded. This makes all the AP buffs NOT stack and provides a large nerf to rogues dps. We did awesome dps via absorbing like 242 different buffs and hitting like 4.5k ap in raid. and need i remind all the stupid fucking qq'ers<br />
<br />
IMPORTANT! Before we are done, we will thoroughly test the performance of every class. It should not be assumed that one class' current performance relative to others in beta is final. Some classes (and specializations) will need to be reduced in power and some increased. Many may feel the change has more impact on class X than class Y. We will address all of those concerns via our internal testing and community feedback.<br />
<br />
GG, calm down. Was TBC really that fuckin terrible to raid in? No...so why do you think that they won't just drastically up the scaling of spriests with dmg and make them fight for the top spots with hunters locks and mages....there is soooo many things they can do. Wait it out.<br />
<br />
Oh and the top people in the game will simply adapt to changes. If you consider yourself decent, you should consider trying that.</div></div><hr />

Sure, that plus utility is the only thing keeping you afloat at the moment, but don't try to force the current situation in wotlk raids. Things WILL change.<br />
<br />
Everybody is losing massive stacking with these changes, making huge dps loss for everyone is the plan in wotlk, however that will make balancing each separate class and working on scaling a lot easier as they won't have to take into account a specific uber-composition.<br />
There is simplification going on, and it's always annoying to see all those synergies we wera having wet dreams about going away, but it should help things in the long run (if Blizzard handles it well).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the classification of buffs/debuffs isn't a TERRIBLE idea. They are clearly balancing raiding to open it up and allow you to bring different classes so you don't have to have the perfect raid group anymore. That's not fundamentally a bad thing, in fact it does make raiding a little easier.<br />
<br />
Hell we've been using a pally to tank illidan and brutallus(which was hard), so we use all sorts of whacky make ups already.<br />
<br />
I'm just annoyed that in order to open raiding up to other classes/specs they totally nerf slap some of the main specs that people are using. Spriests and Locks seem to be hit pretty hard by this.<br />
<br />
We'll see how it balances out, but right now it seems a bit heavy handed.</div></div><hr />

This is going to be like &quot;So, who's throwing up Curse of Elements&quot; &quot;Not me!&quot; People are going to have their &quot;Raid Buff&quot; spec and &quot;pure DPS/heal&quot; spec on backup in case of redundancies. And here I was hoping to have my backup spec being for PVP.<br />
<br />
Also, paladin blessing arguments will still abound.<br />
&quot;I just kings'd everyone, leave me alone!&quot;<br />
&quot;But you have to do sanc&quot;<br />
&quot;Do we even need it or do we have grace?&quot;<br />
<br />
If you think this is going to save time by not having to stack raids, think again.<br />
Now you're gonna sit here for 20 minutes before the raid trying to determine how everyone should be specced. &quot;Let's see, we have the feral druid, umm, warrior are you arms or fury right now?&quot; &quot;Oh hey, other feral druid just logged on, we have our last slot filled&quot; &quot;Which one will tank?&quot; &quot;I have Infected Wounds, want me to respec since *prot warrior with imp TC* is here?&quot; etc. etc. etc.<br />
<br />
I think one way to go about this is to make the passive buffs like LOTP / WF totem do a LESSER effect than the proc. buffs like Rampage / Icy talons, and lower the proc rate so they're not up 100% of the time. That way it pays to have the passive one available, yet still have the other for bursts of a greater buff. Rampage was god damn annoying before, I like that they changed it, but immediately being told &quot;hey, this won't stack with feral druids. Also feral druids can main tank better and dps as good as you&quot; is kind of a backhand to the cheek. I'd certainly take a &quot;30% chance on melee crit to yatta yatta&quot; and have it be better than lotp even if it wasn't up the entire time you're fighting.</div></div><hr />

Yes all Blizzard wants is to destroy/kill professions /sarcasm off</div></div><hr />

But it is important that the community shows the lacking points of the concept. But still the feeling of a unique class with unique abilities is gone. <br />
<br />
This could make encounters easier in a way then before. But at the moment some specs are just sent to the PVE graveyard. For example Sp...</div></div><hr />

Enjoy the summer and see how things turn out. Of course Blizzard is trying to destroy the game and lose as many subscribers as possible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Due to the itemization and ret mana issues I guess the new judgement is ment to be &quot;Your Judgement spells restores your mana totaling 60% of the damage caused and grants Replenishment mana regeneration buff to up to 10 raid members on Judging.&quot; <br />
<br />
But assuming what some of you says it's more like &quot;Your Judgement spells grants Replenishment mana regeneration buff to up to 10 raid members on Judging.&quot; which will make ret paladin most likely unplayable.<br />
<br />
so where's the truth?</div></div><hr />

Wtf is the point of anyone having buffs/debuffs at all?</div></div><hr />

My main is a retribution Paladin - and everything seemed smooth before this.<br />
1. CC - so we can actually be useful in a heroic instance.<br />
2. An effective DPS class, done.<br />
3. Mana battery! yes!<br />
4. pulling mech (no thing as of yet)<br />
5. intercept/ranged charge (none as of yet)<br />
<br />
1. They will keep this hopefully.<br />
2. It seems we're being crippled the more patches they release.<br />
3. Because of judgements of the wise effectively being ruined;<br />
We cannot dps - our seals and abilities work now on a base mana %<br />
We cannot continue to sustain any attacks.<br />
We're useless worse than TBC - its a shame tbh.<br />
4. I doubt Paladins will receive this.<br />
5. Dk already has ours.</div></div><hr />
