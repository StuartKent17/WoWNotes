It is amazing how many people don't know how to play Arcane properly, then blame the class for being the problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
oddly enough, i do like how enhancement plays but i do agree it needs a rework, it needs refocused on phys/nature damage and something to make it gain resources based on crit chance.<br />
that way we have ehne as phys/nature and elem as nature/fire, but elem does share the same lack of crit's effect on player-controlled rotation.</div></div><hr />

What do you expect from a guy who only Raids Normal and needs to drastically out gear it..</div></div><hr />

There isn’t some secret sect of Arcane mages that has discovered the hidden potential of Arcane. It’s a really bad spec. Your 70th percentile rank for arcane would rank like 30th percentile for fire.</div></div><hr />
