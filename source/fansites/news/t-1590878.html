Patch 6.0.2 Preview - User Interface<br />
As players testing Patch 6.0.2 on our Public Test Realm (PTR) have already seen, we’re making a number of changes to the WoW user interface—changes that are designed to eliminate clutter, free up more of your inventory space, help you find your stuff more easily, and improve your quality of life in-game.<br />
<br />
Map &amp; Quest Log<br />
In Patch 6.0.2, we’ve made a brand-new UI to bring together the Map and the Quest Log with everything you need to manage multiple ongoing adventures. Now when you browse by zone in the Map &amp; Quest Log, you’ll find all of the associated quests you’re on, your progress, and relevant cartography.<br />
<br />
In addition to intelligently ordering your quests, the new window (default hotkeys: M or L) gives you more information about your objectives right on the map. It also features scroll-wheel zooming, click-and-hold panning, and a handy View All Quests button—plus, if you leave it open while you’re moving, it fades so that you can see both the map and the landscape you’re venturing into.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Toy Box<br />
All of the fun “toy” items that you’ve accumulated over the course of your travels now have a new home in the Toy Box. As with mounts and pets, you’ll right-click on eligible toy items in your inventory to send them to your Toy Box. Once learned, the toy will be accessible by all characters on your account.<br />
<br />
If you want to expand and complete your collection of toys (or mounts or pets!), you can see each of the ones that you have not yet unlocked, along with information on how they can be obtained. As you might expect, any toy that you’ve learned can be dragged from the Toy Box and placed on a toolbar for fast access.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
How to Randomize Your Dragon<br />
There is now a Summon Random Favorite Mount button at the top-right of your Mounts collection (default hotkey: Shift-P). This smart button selects randomly from among the mounts that you’ve marked as favorites, and chooses a mount that is suitable for your current zone and situation. For example:<br />
<br />
In a zone where you can’t fly, it will choose from among your favorite ground mounts.<br />
If you’re swimming on the surface of a body of water and you have a Water Strider favorited, it will be chosen.<br />
If you’re submerged and you’ve favorited your Sea Turtle, the button will summon it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Right-click and select Set Favorite on your favorite mounts to get started.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Bags, Bags, Bags<br />
In Patch 6.0.2, bags can be given designations for particular types of items. These include:<br />
<br />
Equipment – Your armor and weapons<br />
Consumables – Food and drink, potions, etc.<br />
Trade Goods – Items that are used in professions (herbs, cloth, ore, skins, etc.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/september/thumb/bagUI.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/september/bagUI.jpg) <br />
<br />
When you go to your main backpack and click the Clean Up Bags button in the top-right, your belongings are sorted into your bags based on the designation you assigned to each bag, with overflow going into the backpack. Furthermore, there are now borders around the icons of all items that are colored to indicate item quality; recently looted items glow so that you can quickly spot them; and gray (junk) items have a gold coin icon when you visit a vendor.<br />
<br />
Reagent Bank<br />
You now have additional storage space in your bank! The new 98-slot Reagent Bank tab offers up extra slots for your profession materials, and an option to deposit every reagent that you’re currently carrying in your bags. We’ve also increased the maximum stack size for many materials and reagents, and when you craft anything—from anywhere—you’ll now use materials that are stored back in the bank.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
But Wait, There’s More!<br />
<br />
We’ve added a new tab to the Void Storage system. That’s an extra 80 slots for your long-term storage needs.<br />
The dropdown menus you access when you right-click on a player portrait have been improved.<br />
You can now manage your add-ons without having to log out.<br />
The Dungeon Journal (default hotkey: Shift-J) has been updated with Warlords of Draenor entries.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">markdall</div><div class="date">2014-09-12, 09:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reagent and void additions are so good that, last night when I was able to get my character copied, instead of getting my bars situated I spent the entire time cleaning out my inventory instead. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I've got so much crap in my bags and in my bank that the second void tab won't quite do it, but it's still MUCH better than the situation as it pertains today. Also, until I looked yesterday I hadn't realized that it wasn't a completely separate and very large 'bag' / area for reagents in your bank. I assumed it would just use my existing free (lol none) bank slots. So very glad to be wrong. <br />
<br />
I thought the toybox had been cut, super glad to hear it's still here. <br />
<br />
I feel like the bag purpose selections should be toggles, not radio buttons. That is, I should be able to designate that pack #2 is for consumables AND trade goods, and right now I cannot. Again though this is much better than it was, and between that and all the extra bag space it should work out pretty well. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure I'll need ArkInventory for WoD. <br />
<br />
I'd love to be able to ditch ElvUI (nothing against it, it just slows down my framerate compared to running no addons) but the default UI still doesn't crutch me along enough for my gimpy butt to raid. <br />
<br />
But damn, PTR with no addons has such a nice framerate and the character models all look superb.</div></div><hr />

You can sort things with extreme amounts of customization though, which is the big plus.</div></div><hr />

Can you make it look different? I mean, this layout, with different sizes of areas and not all slots there (you can see the blue background, but there is no bag slot) is what bothers me. Can you change that to, say, nice squares of equal size?</div></div><hr />

I would have prefer'd them to keep map and quest log as two different parts, like currently on LIVE version.<br />

Extra stuff that you might still wind up using like gear that isn't BIS but is still the same ilvl as what you're currently using. Stuff for CMs where there's more sockets, or whatever. <br />
<br />
If you're me, all the extra stuff that wouldn't fit in the second void storage tab. :/</div></div><hr />

Always someone has to resort to that childish argument.<br />
Yet how many of the &quot;experienced&quot; players opt to level without heirlooms ?<br />
Not many.<br />
<br />
Good riddance to bad rubbish.<br />
<br />
The levelling experience has to cater primarily to those new to the game, and even new to the genre.<br />
If you want extra difficultly then go look for it, do content above your level, do dungeons with fewer members if not solo.<br />
Because YOU want a challenge, it does not mean that it should be forced upon everyone because you are too damn lazy to go create or look for it yourself.<br />
<br />
I can't comment personally on the new quest log functionality due to not having experienced it yet, but I welcome the extra storage.<br />
The toybox and reagent bank are going to be the primary improvements there.<br />
I may still use a 3rd party bag replacement for sorting which suits me, but at least there will be a LOT less stuff cluttering it up.<br />
<br />
Void Storage use comes with a cost, so is better suited to items you don't need traditional access to.<br />
The traditional bank suits equipment or other items you do need to withdraw/deposit regularly.</div></div><hr />

There's an &quot;Ignore this bag&quot; option. So I guess you could just choose to ignore every bag and then if you misclick it won't auto arrange anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It doesn't work for profession specific bags and there's no way to ignore your bank (I can't find at least) not sure about void storage and guild bank :/<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
Ok. just checked. Void storage is not affected and there's no clean up button (that's great). I can ignore bags in main bank but not bank itself.<br />
<br />
So there's still problem with profession specific bags and main/reagent bank.</div></div><hr />

Oh. I hate that there are still profession specific bags to begin with. Seems like with this revamp and adding all of that bank space they could have just done something GW2 style and made all of your crafting mats auto deposit to your bank. :( Especially since you can now craft with items from your bank.</div></div><hr />

Why was this necessary? If the abilities the glyphs provided are so critical, then they should have been baked into the respective baseline skill instead of screwing with the market for Inscription.<br />
<br />
Simply because it is awkward for new player to not be able to use a glyph even when they get the glyph slots at 25+50 because they simply do not have the gold to get them. And new player mostly doesn't know how to make money over the auction house. And because they never used the glyphs because they simply didn't have one, there are then a lot of max-level-player who didn't even have all major glyph slots equiped.<br />
<br />
Also because a lot of old profession mats got hit with the nerf-bat really bad in WoD, it is even harder to make gold in WoD with them. So they decided to give Player some Glyphs to let them see how they works and what they can do with them.<br />
<br />
In the end this is a good addition, especially when most glyphs that player get are simply leveling glpyhs that don't have that much value on max-level.</div></div><hr />

as it godamn should be, balancing one spec out of the 3 of each class to perform in pvp in all aspects is already hard and taxing, balancing the tank spec to be usuable in pvp should never be suggested, pvp arena is about killing the opponnent, not tanking him if you have the dps and mobility of a dps spec even without vengeance whats the point.<br />

Are you kidding me? Bags are still going to be in demand for self-sufficient hoardies like me who hang on to current mats plus those of yesteryear. I probably might even be able to get away with changing house-cleaning from an annual event to biennial! :D<br />

And that's just for profession bags. I can guarantee you that there'll be plenty of players who'll fill the second Void Storage tab to the brim and then are back at square one of needing to buy 28-slot bags or whatever.<br />
<br />
Now, I suppose I ought to temper my excitement a bit and note that it will in all likelihood have a noticeable effect on the market where bags are concerned. BUT I don't believe it's going to be as dreadful as you make it out to be. :)</div></div><hr />
