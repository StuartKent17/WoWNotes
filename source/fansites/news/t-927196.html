Legendary Item - Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest<br />
Steadfast raiders have an opportunity to embark on a series of quests to create an all-new legendary caster staff. In order to begin the process of assembling the staff, players must first kill a Molten Lord in the Firelands, or have completed any of the achievements Bastion of Twilight, Blackwing Descent, or Throne of the Four Winds. Once any of these achievements have been unlocked, players can accept the quest A Legendary Engagement from Ziradormi in Grommash Hold in Orgrimmar, or Coridormi atop the Wizard's Sanctum in Stormwind (players who have already completed any of these achievements are immediately eligible for this quest). Players who become eligible for the quest series by killing a Molten Lord in the Firelands will automatically receive the quest Your Time Has Come, leading them to the start of the questline. The legendary item questline is only available to druids, mages, priests, shaman, and warlocks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Free WoW keys sent to subscribers<br />
The updated Recruit a Friend bonus isn't the only thing Blizzard decided to do, they also sent free WoW keys to a lot of subscribers to let them invite a friend who doesn't want/can't buy the game! You might want to check your email to see if you were elligible to this. <br />

I called Blizzard Entertainment on this the other night. Trevor from Customer Service mentioned even though you might have been playing since Vanilla World of Warcraft that you also had to have an active account for a certain amount of time. He didn't go into much detail about this, but from what I gathered if you had a few dry months of no active subscription you might be excluded from the list. <br />
<br />
It would make more sense to look at the account creation date (which got removed with the new Battle.net interface) however they should be able to see this.</div></div><hr />

Upon talking to a GM about it i am safe to say that this &quot;free wow too veteran players&quot; only counts for the U.S players. The GM was also confident that this would later come to the EU players, timestamp was ofc not given.<br />

You realise it's only 30 days? In other words, you'll have to pay anyway after those 30 days, and will have to buy the expantions.<br />
If you are not sure if you want to play the game, just get the 10 day trial.<br />
