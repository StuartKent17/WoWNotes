http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/deathknight.jpg Death Knight Changes<br />
The original title of the post was &quot;Thoughts on death knights&quot;, as usual it doesn't mean that anything in this list is final.<br />
<br />
We’re not prepared to announce specific changes to DKs yet, but here are some general areas we are tinkering with. Most of these changes apply predominantly to tanking death knights, so I avoided cross-posting this thread, but there are probably items of interest to dps specs as well.<br />
<br />
Death knights seem to tank well when they have cooldowns available and take too much damage otherwise. The change here seems obvious – boost Frost presence’s mitigation while reducing the mitigation of some other abilities, especially Icebound Fortitude and Bone Shield.<br />
One idea we have for Icebound Fortitude is to scale the mitigation based on defense skill. This lets the ability be less of a paladin bubble in PvP for dps knights, while still letting it act more like Shield Wall for tanks. It also has the side effect of making defense slightly more attractive to death knights. (Let me add before it’s asked that yes we understand Ferals have this problem too and we are working on it.)<br />
Unholy is a very popular tanking spec, largely on the strength of Bone Shield. Expect to see some buffs to tanking talents in the Blood tree especially.<br />
Rune Strike was intended to be a reactive tanking tool, not a rogue killer. We will probably chill its weapon damage and increase its threat.<br />
We don’t like the behavior where DKs feel like they are supposed to drop Death and Decay to generate runic power before a pull. It just looks goofy. We will probably lower the runic power costs of Unholy Blight and Horn of Winter, which seem to be the primary reasons to generate RP. Horn of Winter will probably be something like no cost, 30 sec cooldown, generates 10 rp. (EDIT: I am refering to using DnD outside of combat just for the runic power (kind of like Bloodrage for warriors). It's totally legit and intended to use it to start a fight to gain threat and hurt the bad guys.)<br />
There are some odd situations caused by Shadow of Death that we would like to fix. The talent isn’t designed to let you escape durability damage or rez by zoning into an instance.<br />
There are some annoying parts of the non-pet ghoul. We want to lower the aggro range (for less accidental pulls) and spawn the ghoul in quicker when dismounting. The ghoul, at least Unholy’s version, could also use some AE avoidance like other pets.<br />
We are probably going to add a new spell to let you raise fallen allies so that you don't have to make the decision between bringing back another player (which was just supposed to be a fun bonus) and bringing back your ghoul, which can be pretty crticial for some specs.<br />
<br />
This isn't everything we're talking about of course, just a little preview. <br />
<br />
Sigils<br />
We are aware that DKs may be struggling more to get defense. They lack tanking weapons, shields and guns, all of which can provide defense to warriors. It's something we're working on. <br />
<br />
AoE as Blood<br />
We're also working on Blood AE. <br />
<br />
Horn of Winter Glyph<br />
We would change the Horn of Winter glyph (to something like duration).<br />
<br />
Tanking oriented 2H Weapons<br />
I would not expect full itemization for two-handed tanking weapons. We wanted DKs to tank with dps two-handers (and have their mitigation benefit somewhat from the dps stats). We might add a craftable weapon or something down the road, but only if that felt like an option for the DK, not a mandatory piece of gear. You can also dual-wield tanking weapons if you want, but again, it isn't the intent that is the only way to play. (Please don't turn the rest of this thread into a discussion of whether or not DKs should be able to dual-wield.) <br />
<br />
Rune Strike<br />
Rune Strike is a tanking ability. It was designed to let DKs make up for the fact that their threat suffers so much from hits that fail to land. It does suffer from a confusing tooltip (which we have since fixed) but it is the DK who must avoid the attack to get Rune Strike to light up. <br />
<br />
Active abilities usage<br />
We still like DKs as the &quot;active abilities&quot; tank. We just think it might be a little too extreme right now. Icebound Fortitude was intended to be something you use when a big, predictable damage spike is coming, but DK tanks seem to want to keep them up 100% of the time for fear that they will die without them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue posts<br />
PvP Forums<br />
We don't have a PvP role forum (though there is a PvP forum) for the specific reason that we wanted the ability to discuss PvP and PvE issues at once. I realize not every player is interested in PvP -- that's cool, not every player is interested in paladin tank mechanics either. But it is totally appropriate to discuss PvP issues in all 3 role forums. Obviously we don't want PvP (or PvE) discussions to dominate. PvP is a part of the game and we do make balance changes for PvP reasons. Obviously we don't want PvP (or PvE) balance to dominate. Please do not use the rest of this thread to refute any of those claims (though starting others is fine if you really feel the need). (Source (http://))<br />
<br />
&quot;Bind to Account&quot; items<br />
Yes, currently you can only mail the items to characters on the same account and on the same realm. <br />
<br />
Horde and Alliance? Like if i got it on alliance i could send it to a horde alt?<br />
Unfortunately not. The usual mail restrictions still apply. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/6986892670-bind-to-account-experience.html))<br />
<br />
Gear optimization and class comparison<br />
I agree with a couple of posts in this thread that players tend to look at all the loot tables in the game, imagine that they have all of that loot, and then compare themselves to other players of equal gear. The reality is that very few players are ever in that situation of being unable to upgrade, and to be honest, the game starts to be a lot less fun when you do reach that point. The potential to improve your character is one of strongest motivators to keep playing WoW. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/12454677501-the-druid-dilemma-worst-healers-postnaxx.html))<br />
<br />
Legendary items<br />
There was an orange bow and orange blades in BC. Did that mean that hunters and rogues lacking those weapons were uncompetitive? Not really. Did that mean the trend was to keep dropping better and better hunter and rogue gear compared to other characters? Not really. It is a useful tool to imagine gear that is several tiers higher than current itemization and estimate what characters will look like then -- we use it ourself. But remember that gear is not real gear. If resto druids fall behind when everyone has 10,000 spellpower, then we're not really going to lose sleep over it, because the game will have changed so much by the time that gear becomes reality. If they fall behind when everyone has 3000 spellpower, then maybe it's a problem (though we don't think it is the case that they do).

Rune Strike tooltip<br />
Yes, we fixed this. Sorry for the confusion. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13129109706-tool-tip-4-rune-strike-fixed-in-future-builds.html))<br />

Nourish<br />
I have to admit that after my reference to Nourish yesterday I was contacted by several very good raiding druids who told me I was out of my mind and that's it's a really good spell. When I asked them why so many druids don't like it, their response was that it's Flash Heal, and they want it to be something else.<br />
<br />
So there you go. When I have healed as Resto, I didn't use Nourish much, but I should give it another look.<br />
<br />
This is antecdotal data, and it's just as easy for anyone to say that they talked to a druid who said they can heal everything with Rejuv so Rejuv is OP. That is why we tend to be persuaded more by numbers (and even more by in-game numbers), but I do place a lot of value on the opinions of skilled players too. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/12454677501-the-druid-dilemma-worst-healers-postnaxx.html))<br />
<br />
Stats diversity<br />
On the topic of number of stats, as I said, you can play that card both ways. If you only need say spellpower, then it's relatively easy to just stack spellpower (warlocks were in this situation in much of BC). If you need lots of stats, it can sometimes be hard to fit the jigsaw puzzle to get them all (Prot warriors were in this situation in much of BC). As I said, there are advantages and disadvantages to both. We disagree that classes or specs who need fewer stats are at a competitive disadvantage or we would stop designing classes that way.

Yeah... people complained about getting stunned to death by Paladins, but apparently it's still OK for a Rogue to do it...<br />
<br />
Some Rogue players say it requires skill to do it. I don't care. I can't use any skill in the world to get out of it (and don't mention trinket, since ONE stun removal is not nearly enough when they've got so many more stuns than one). It's entirely one-sided, something no other class CC is since they are either on long cooldowns, share DR, break on damage, or simply don't exist.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, raising the mana cost and dropping it to maybe 2% of allies health per second might work. <br />
<br />
But it would have to be a holy only talent.. like Consecration originally was.<br />
<br />
Honestly though, I can totally picture a holy pally running in to a boss' feet, dropping consecrate, then running out as every other member of the raid flocks to stand in the wet yellow spot he/she left on the ground. Rather amusing really. <br />

Um, the stun most people trinket is kidney shot and that requires energy and combo points. We sacrifice a lot of damage for it and we have to build up combo points first before we can use it. The other one can be used while stealthed. It's not like a pally stunning willy nilly with no affect on dps.<br />

<br />
<br />
Yeah... people complained about getting stunned to death by Paladins, but apparently it's still OK for a Rogue to do it...<br />
<br />
<br />
People complained about paladin stuns because during a single stun duration, they yielded about 11-12k worth of damage. That's about as much health as a BT rogue had. No skill- just walk up, and spam that /castsequence macro. <br />
<br />
Nobody complains about it anymore because rogues are packing about 15,000-17,000HP at 80 with leveling gear. Now when rogues get a single stunn they don't die. If rogues wore plate and could bubble-heal themselves, I could see your argument.<br />
<br />
So what, rogues have stuns? You have the chances for stun duration reduction, stun damage reduction and of course, there's diminishing returns on all of our stuns. All three of them. Not to mention paladins get an aura that does damage every time they're attacked (a sure rogue-killer for those with .4 weapon speed)<br />

<br />
this could be really bad for pvp depending on how bad they ass rape those 2 attacks Bone Armor is 40% dmg reduction for 4 hits (5 with glyph) if they nerf it to anything lower its going to be worthless in pvp IMO and icebound fortitude will become alot less useluff in pvp if they lower it more then 30% dmg reduction</div></div><hr />

&quot;Working as intended... for Rogues&quot;.<br />
<br />
With so much HP how someone can die to ret aura...??? really lol.<br />
<br />
Btw, Blizz should review their &quot;lvl70 nerfs&quot; since now players have lvl 80 toons with lvl80 sta, lvl80 armor, lvl80 resi... and can handle the old &quot;lvl80skills damage@lvl70&quot;. Why ppl don't QQ about &quot;we have too much HP/Resi now at 80 blizz, put the damage back 'cause we can't die anymore from old skills&quot; now?!? Funny...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Death knights seem to tank well when they have cooldowns available and take too much damage otherwise. The change here seems obvious – boost Frost presence’s mitigation while reducing the mitigation of some other abilities, especially Icebound Fortitude and Bone Shield.<br />
<br />
this could be really bad for pvp depending on how bad they ass rape those 2 attacks Bone Armor is 40% dmg reduction for 4 hits (5 with glyph) if they nerf it to anything lower its going to be worthless in pvp IMO and icebound fortitude will become alot less useluff in pvp if they lower it more then 30% dmg reduction <br />
<br />

why do you guys have trouble tanking...... the only time i need some extra def or dodge (from trink) is when a boss has a soft enrage or if there are 4+mobs all hitting for 4k</div></div><hr />

<br />
People complained about paladin stuns because during a single stun duration, they yielded about 11-12k worth of damage. That's about as much health as a BT rogue had. No skill- just walk up, and spam that /castsequence macro. <br />
<br />
Nobody complains about it anymore because rogues are packing about 15,000-17,000HP at 80 with leveling gear. Now when rogues get a single stunn they don't die. If rogues wore plate and could bubble-heal themselves, I could see your argument.<br />
<br />
So what, rogues have stuns? You have the chances for stun duration reduction, stun damage reduction and of course, there's diminishing returns on all of our stuns. All three of them. Not to mention paladins get an aura that does damage every time they're attacked (a sure rogue-killer for those with .4 weapon speed)<br />
<br />
&quot;Working as intended&quot;<br />
<br />
It's just too bad that:<br />
a) I don't play Paladin<br />
b) Few of the others at the receiving end of a Rogue stunlock play Paladin<br />
<br />
Paladins are probably the ones, along with Mages, who are best at dealing with stunlocks. Other classes aren't quite so lucky.<br />
<br />
Also, last I checked, the stuns weren't on a shared DR, only on individual DRs.</div></div><hr />
