PTR Bug Report Update<br />
We’ve got an update incoming to the In-Game Bug Reporter for our Public Test Realm (PTR). We’re excited about this, because it should make it even easier for testers to get the right information to us as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
Starting with the Rise of Azshara PTR, you’ll see a new context-sensitive hotkey for submitting bug reports. When you mouse over any Creature, NPC, Item, Achievement, or Spell in the game, there’s now some blue text at the bottom of the tooltip that reads “Press F6 to submit a bug for this Item”.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/april/thumb/bugptr01.png (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/april/bugptr01.png)<br />
<br />
Simply hit that hotkey while mousing over the item or creature or spell you’d like to report, and you’ll see a text box pop up with the model of the creature or icon corresponding to the relevant spell or item. From there just type a short description of the misbehavior you observed, and your bug report will be sent to our Quality Assurance team for review.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/april/thumb/bugptr02.png (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/april/bugptr02.png)<br />
<br />
The default hotkey for bug reporting is F6, but this can be re-bound to any other key by pressing escape to bring up the game menu, and then selecting Key Bindings. Find the PTR sub-section of the Key Bindings menu and set the hotkey for the Tooltip Bug Hotkey to any key you like.<br />

<br />
Thanks to all testers who’ve used the In-Game Bug Reporter in previous PTRs. With your help, we’ve been able to review tens of thousands of bug reports. With these upcoming improvements to the system, we hope to be able to process and review even more issues that you send our way.<br />
We’ll see you in the PTR.<br />
<br />
<br />
How do you report something that the game doesn’t recognize as an object? Like misplaced textures or missing objects.<br />
There will still be an on-screen bug button that you can use to submit anything you’d like to, from any disposition.<br />
<br />
<br />

Water Strider Discussion<br />
A small clarification to our plans with Mount Equipment–<br />
Hitting level 100 on one character will unlock this system. Once unlocked, the system will be available to all characters, and the equipment pieces themselves will require level 20. If your goal is to have waterwalking while leveling, you can just enable the waterwalking Mount Equipment (there will be one available via Anglers reputation that will be bind-on-account), and it’ll work exactly as before, with the benefit of making all of that character’s mounts walk on water. (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1105253-water-strider-discussion/) / Official Forums (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/148759/170))<br />
<br />
Yeah, but now you’d have the ability to use a mount, besides the Water Strider.<br />
I dunno about you, but being stuck using only one mount forever sounds absolutely boring as hell<br />
That’s one of the goals here. There are a lot of mounts out there and it’s strange to have a “wrong choice” when out running around. You’ll easily be able to keep the ability just as you have it now but there will be other options that you (the player) can make if you prefer something else. How you about the world, where you often go, and how fast you like to escape from things could all contribute to what works best for your playstyle.<br />
<br />
There are a few extra notes so like Death Knights can do waterwalking via Path of Frost (and Shaman with Water Walking). That should help empower these classes a bit and help make them feel a bit more unique.<br />
<br />
I’m not sure what the price of the waterwalking shoes will be offhand, but it should be pretty affordable on the Anglers vendor. We’ll have the PTR up soon™ and look forward to hearing your feedback on that. (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1105253-water-strider-discussion/) / Official Forums (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/148759/1548))<br />
<br />
Would it be possible to have the water strider be like the sky golem. It can have innate water walking but is not effected by mount equipment?<br />
I will check but my personal opinion from my play experience is that the water strider ability is just much stronger than the sky golem herbing. We nerfed the water strider once and if we leave it with the ability there then it’s more in the line of getting everything and less of making a choice for what you want. We want there to be a choice based on your play and interests. If herbing on the run provides too strong of a benefit then there might need to be changes there but currently I don’t think that’s the case. (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1105253-water-strider-discussion/) / Official Forums (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/148759/1567))<br />
<br />
Brave soul. I commend you for stepping into this thread on the Monday evening preceding the drop of 8.2 on the PTR. However, this price you speak of not knowing offhand is what will be a determining factor in many players decisions. Personally, I’ve stuck by/accepted/dealt with the changes made over the years to keep the gameplay from just becoming a static habit. But having spent my money and time acquiring the rep required to gain the reward, only to have it removed and then require it to be re-purchased…no. That’s the line. I’m sorry to sound like I’m giving an ultimatum because it’s not. It’s a decision made based on honor, or the lack thereof.<br />
<br />
EDIT - and to be perfectly fair, yes, I agree and have so for many years that Blizzard has the right to change content at their discretion at any time. But this is one of those times I won’t be agreeing with it.<br />
Just something I’d like to get your perspective on, if the character who earned the Anglers reputation along with the mount gets the water walking item for free, what would a fair price be for the alts to get it? If that character who earned the reputation and mount has the option to water walk (but might choose something else), do you feel that alts should have every single thing that the other characters have?<br />
<br />
Also, just out of curiosity, how often would you estimate that you have you used the water strider mount in the 6+ years it’s been available?<br />
Thanks folks for chatting! (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1105253-water-strider-discussion/) / Official Forums (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/148759/1664))<br />

Won’t say I’m a fan of it, but it’s qn interesting idea for some work around WoD minor problems/annoyances involving mounts. Wonder how long before all the naysayers and complainers take to pop up speaking about how horrible things like this are and why Blizz doesn’t do other things.</div></div><hr />

Maybe have an account wide achievement that is required for it to be available or something, but just have it so you can either mail it to the low level alt, or have the alt go there later once they've leveled up to get it for themselves if they try swapping it out.</div></div><hr />

You just know they'll add more equipment over time. Maybe a Demon Hunter Glide type ability for using flying mounts in non-flying areas.</div></div><hr />

I agree it's a bummer to lose the &quot;prestige&quot; of having earned the Water Strider, but to be perfectly honest EVERYONE has one, there's no prestige anymore (timewalking makes it really fast to earn reputation via tokens anyway). During MoP (remember: 7 years ago!) it was really a feat to have it, I remember in my server really few people had it, but it's already time to let it go.<br />

I'll probably get the slow fall equipment because even though my main is an engineer, I can't really bother to remember making bundles of Goblin Gliders and send to all my alts.</div></div><hr />

It's because those trinkets, like the Diamond-Laced Refracting Prism, were stupid broken in pvp. Sure they could of nerfed it for just pvp, but I'm positive it's possible to negate mechanics with that shield strength.</div></div><hr />

They have it already. Goblin glider. The bad portion of this is it opens the door for them to change how water walking is gained much easier. Like linking it to an achievement if they so chose. Remember when flying was just a purchase and now its a grind?</div></div><hr />

READ IT AGAIN, you get it for free if you already have the strider... It's BOA, it means than once you've &quot;learned&quot; it, all your char can use it via the mount pannel, you know, like all the FU**ING MOUNTS for like 10 years now.

He's joking right? Until Blizzard made underwater mounts realistically obtainable in Legion (no the Poseidus mount doesn't count) people have been using the Water Strider almost exclusively when traveling near water since MoP. Heck I would use the UW mounts more if they would surface properly instead of hopping out of the water and dismounting all the time or gave a delay on the breath bar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, it just could have been great if they would have put a bit more effort in this. Like you said - underwater mounts should be able to swim on the surface properly. Additionally a bit more creativity would have been great to utilize more mounts. E.g. Crocolisks and Hippos could be able to swim on and unter the water surface, but get a ~10% speed reduction when walking on proper ground. Water breathing for some underwater mounts would also be nice, even if underwater breathing is not that big of a deal anymore. Horses could get a +10% movement boost, goats and rams a DH'ish double jump, wolves a short movement speed boost as special ability, dragons a short 1,5sec stun when landing.... I could go on like this forever :P <br />
<br />
Just add some unique stuff and stop the generic solutions for everything. I just hate myself for wasting so many timewarped badges to push the reputation to buy the water strider ~4months ago. Did not need it before since I mained DK most of the time. Now there are new mounts available for the badges and I cannot buy them x_x</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even that argument, as powerless as it is today, is still somewhat valid, since the water walking item will be on the same vendor that sells you the strider in the first place. And of course you still have the mount to show off if you so wish!<br />

There is only one slot, so you get to decide if you want water walking or any of the other options. I'll definitely use water walking though. Daze protection is nice and all, but then, tanks don't get dazed in the first place.</div></div><hr />

Currently: Water Walking on Water Striders only.<br />

8.2: If you have a Water Strider you get Water Walking on all mounts, account wide, for free, with the option to swap it out for other mount utility.<br />
<br />
It is, without any doubt, a pure buff to your mount collection.<br />

Worst case scenario, you login, equip the free Inflatible Mount Shoes you get in the mail, and now you have permanent free Water Walking on your entire collection, including on your Water Striders, just like before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Currently, waterstriders, path of frost, and shaman waterwalking all break on dmg from mobs. However, unlike the other 2, the waterstrider waterwalking does NOT break from falling dmg. Jump onto water from a small ledge? Keep riding your waterstrider even if you take a little falling dmg. If you're a DK or shaman you have to recast your relevant spell.<br />
<br />
In that respect, the new ww equipment will likely be a nerf. Hopefully I'm wrong, but with all the homogenisation going on it's very likely I'm not.</div></div><hr />

Yeah because Blizzard do give a fk about bugs. Like the one which happens since early beta and occured again during weekend on MDI... :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you serious? I had no idea about that really. Holy shit gotta try that. Never used the summon favorite mount function.</div></div><hr />

We have been stuck with a very similar dungeon design due to this. Skipping most of the trash in Tol Dagor at the start is not actually intended but water strider allows it and people without the mount found a gap they never bothered to fix. <br />
<br />
People in WoW are just super dramatic. The item will still probably require Anglers rep so people are just crying for the sake of crying. Also quit acting like this is some big deal as timewalking made all your effort pointless quite awhile ago. <br />
<br />
I would be more concerned with the massive grind in the heart of Azeroth but why focus on something important that will make or break this expansion.</div></div><hr />

You guys complain about the waterstrider mount change, when it was a mount that was force into since it was introduce. Now they adding the possibily to have this ability on every mount, and we complain like babies???? It make 0 sense why ppl complain there isnt a single valid point so far.<br />
<br />
If you didnt unlock one of the 3 strider at this point is bc you dont care, and now that they adding this you care and you complain, is that simple.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Currently: Water Walking on Water Striders only.<br />
<br />
8.2: If you have a Water Strider you get Water Walking on all mounts, account wide, for free, with the option to swap it out for other mount utility.<br />
<br />
It is, without any doubt, a pure buff to your mount collection.<br />
<br />
Worst case scenario, you login, equip the free Inflatible Mount Shoes you get in the mail, and now you have permanent free Water Walking on your entire collection, including on your Water Striders, just like before.<br />
<br />
but that's not how it's going to work... each of your character has one slot for him/herself. the item you get BoA because you already have the water strider, you can only use ONCE. you will need your character with the rep to BUY a new one for EACH character you want water walking on.<br />
<br />
and if you want to change the mount equipment, you replace the existing one, like gems on a piece of armor, and if you want to swap back ? you need to buy the previous one again.<br />
<br />
why not simply put a slot on each mount, you get more water walking mounts, you put the parachute on some others, and anti-daze on others... CHOICES ?<br />
nope, you get one equipment active per character for all mounts, genius &lt;_&lt;</div></div><hr />

I don’t have a problem with it outside of the selective favoritism. Certain other mounts, such as the sky golem, don’t lose their special effects while others like the waterstrider do. Seems like the devs picked and chooses their favorites there. <br />
<br />
It should be all or nothing on the mount redesign. Don’t say we are taking special effects off of mounts but ignoring X mount because we like it</div></div><hr />

Playerbase: omg, the economy is broke, Blizzard fix it!<br />
Blizz: got you fam, we’ll make gold sinks to stabilize the economy.<br />
Playerbase: god dammit Blizzard I want that stuff too! Quit trying to balance economy with gold sinks!<br />
<br />
Just sad you and people like you can’t see the good in anything and everything Blizz does is solely to make them money. Guess what, companies want money. Blizz is going for this at the same time they are trying to make things players will enjoy while doing it. They don’t always succeed, but you and others with your attitudes are just becoming annoying and acting like the equivalent of a 2yo throwing a tantrum.</div></div><hr />

Oh Blizzard, the things you get excited about at this day and age scare me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Currently on the PTR, if you have the Water Strider, every character on your account will get a complimentary &quot;Angler's Water Striders&quot; mount equipment in the mail upon logging in.<br />
<br />
Making it per-mount is ridiculous. Who wants to kit out dozens of different mounts across all their characters?</div></div><hr />

The &quot;discounted&quot; price for this equipment piece is 40g. Each time you want water walking you have to pay 40g. The other pieces will be more expensive since this is &quot;discounted&quot;. Blizzard flooded the economy with gold between WoD and Legion and BFA went the complete opposite between low gold rewards and a profession system that promoted little to no gold making ability since most of the items were BoP. As someone who has made millions of gold through the years through a range of methods from transmog selling to playing the AH to pets and gold farming I can assure you I have a pretty good idea on how the WoW economy works. Making gold more difficult to come by only encourages people to purchase WoW tokens to sell. And if you truly believe the WoW token is market controlled then I have an iceberg to sell you.</div></div><hr />

Who said anything about the WoW token but you? Blizzard created gold sinks to help the economy. To say that it is purely to get people to buy the token is outright false.<br />
The token was also made to combat gold farmers. People were making money in real life selling gold in game. Blizzard was unable to keep up with bans and other software that allowed this to happen, so to combat it they made their own way to sell gold while keeping player in their terms of service. They found a way to stop a problem while not punishing the player.<br />
You, and others like you, bring up that stupid token every time Blizzard puts something in game as some conspiracy theory that they only do it to sell tokens. It’s a sad, pathetic little broken record at this point, and no matter how much you talk down to someone pointing out the flaw in your arguement just shows that you would rather spew nonsense than talk about something critically.</div></div><hr />
