Your type of people support COD and other games... No. don't buy the game, guys. Wait a few months, maybe a year and see if they fix anthing. I will post a full list about the bugs what I've found on reddit so people can see how the devs don't really care...</div></div><hr />

psycopaths? lol<br />
well if you see potential take a break and wait until that potential shows.<br />
if you are giving them your money when you dislike the game that just makes them stick with that, cause why make you enjoy it, if you are still gunna pay them for it.</div></div><hr />

In Legion most of the serious balancing took place in the dead time before EN opened. We'll probably see the same here.</div></div><hr />

Yes, schizophrenic to be exact, they can't even make up their minds about what to do with DKs, just shuffling talents around, removing spells they say make the specs which everyone agrees they do and then they put it back so we have to push it even more often. They stated that balancing and designing classes will not be ready for launch for sure, the most they do is that everyhing will &quot;function&quot; and we will get a huge 8.1 rework update. So yea, they can't balance or schedule any of their work appropriately.</div></div><hr />

Or maybe let everyone decide how to spend their money individualy? Or are you also suggesting people shouldnt go to the cinemas when a movie is fresh, or books, or songs etc?<br />

Welcome to the 21st century my friend. Left your cave recently and still didnt adapt to the reality? Or are you that type of a person who thinks only blizzard is evil and the rest of the world is good guys?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope. This just typically happens towards the end of a beta - lots of smaller patches but with a lot of fixes. Try again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Battle for Azeroth BETA still feels rougher around the edges than previous BETA's. I've only been a part of the BETA's since Mists of Pandaria so I can't really say anything about how the Cataclysm, Wrath of the Lich King and The Burning Crusade felt right before release.<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor didn't feel this rough with just tops 14 days before development has to freeze to finalise the release build. Neither did Legion or Mists of Pandaria. Does that mean it will be all wacky for release? Only time will tell. Warlords of Draenor was at its best at release, it was the complete lack of content patches afterwards that made the expansion disappointing and of course the fact that time-travelling is such a horrible premise for anything...<br />
<br />
What I can't understand is why they had to give us a release date so early. They have already said that a lot of the class changes and balancing will be pushed back to the first content patch (8.1) and we still notice a bunch of bugs right before the release has to go Gold.. Why release it the 14th of August and not just push it back to September-October and have it all ready for release?<br />
<br />
Why is there such a pressure for the expansion to be released as early as August? At release is normally the peak of the game. If they mess it up for the release a bunch of people will be gone immediately and won't come back for 8.1.. Just take your time and do it right like Blizzard used to do back in the day. This whole release keeps feeling really rushed and the current BETA builds seems to understate that.<br />
<br />
Hopefully it will all be good and dandy for release, but I'm starting to have my doubts.<br />

<br />
That has always been the case so it doesn't really change the fact that the BETA still feels somewhat buggy and rough around the edges compared to the previous BETA's this close to release. Sure, no-one can say anything for certain until we have the release build but there sure is reason for being sceptical.</div></div><hr />
