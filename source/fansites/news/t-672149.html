Today is another small update of Patch 3.3 quests. You might remember from the World of Warcraft - Cataclysm (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/) leak that Cairne would eventually .... &quot;leave&quot; Thunder Bluff. Once again it looks like this will be confirmed at some point after the release of Patch 3.3. <br />
<br />
A new NPC has been added to the game - Baine Bloodhoof (Leader) (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/36648/baine-bloodhoof-leader/).<br />
A new version of Rites of the Earthmother (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/776/rites-of-the-earthmother/) quest has been added to the game &gt; Rites of the Earthmother (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/14440/rites-of-the-earthmother/). Baine Bloodhoof replaces his father in this quest. <br />
A new version of Journey Into Thunder Bluff (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/775/journey-into-thunder-bluff/) quest has been added to the game &gt; Journey into Thunder Bluff (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/14439/journey-into-thunder-bluff/). Baine Bloodhoof replaces his father in this quest. <br />
<br />
This change isn't active on PTRs for the moment but Blizzard is definitely getting a few things ready for when it will happen ... <br />
<br />
<br />
The Forge of Souls Preview<br />
Here is a short video preview of the Forge of Souls, the first wing of the 5-man dungeon of the Icecrown Citadel. The instance is currently bugged on PTRs but will most likely be available in the next PTR Build. <br />

Icecrown 5-Man Dungeon Loot on PTRs<br />
Currently the items available from the 5 man dungeons is not ready to be tested. When it is ready, it will start dropping from the bosses. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/13/20133930859-when-will-loot-start-dropping-in--h-5-man.html))<br />
<br />
Pre-Cataclysm Events<br />
I want to stress something: at no point in the trailer or on the website is it mentioned or even alluded to that the fight against the Lich King will happen the same time as the cataclysm. I can definitely see where one might get that impression, but the actual storyline is not going to be quite that compact. <br />
<br />
[...] One thing I should mention right off the bat: there are no current plans to exclude players from Orgrimmar by any criteria to my knowledge.<br />
<br />
As for the rest of what's been floating around, I will say that there is reason behind every choice. As I said earlier, I'm not going to explain the story before it happens, but I will emphasize that there is a story, and these aren't aribtrary decisions. <br />
<br />
[...] As for Thrall, I sincerely doubt you could call what happens &quot;ruining&quot; him, but neither is he a perfect leader. He's made mistakes of his own, and not all of them have to do with what people consider the biggest threats to the Horde. <br />
<br />
I am not going to give hints on what will happen, but I will say this: we have no intention of removing all honor from the Horde and making them out to be a faction of pure evil. Thrall's honor, however, is not the only definition.<br />
<br />
I will also say that while I have read a large number of rumors and speculation concerning what's to come, I haven't seen a single one that has the progresson of events or the reasons behind them correct. ;) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/29/20140809141-why-garrosh.html))<br />
<br />
Only one new class in 5 years?<br />
<br />
Beyond the balance concern, which is a valid one, we don't want to over-saturate World of Warcraft with different classes. We want to make sure each class has a very distinct set of core mechanics from other classes. Continually introducing new classes can tend to bring about a feeling of redundancy if we're not fully comfortable with developing an entirely new set of mechanics distinct from the current classes.<br />
<br />
This does not mean that we'll never consider adding new classes to the game as time moves on, but we're pretty happy with the play styles represented by the classes currently available. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/20140811526-1-new-class-in-5-years--not-acceptable.html))<br />
<br />
Expert Riding Skill Price in 3.2.2<br />
The full price of Expert Riding is 250g. I listed 225g in my original post thinking that most everyone would have at least honored with Stormwind or Orgrimmar faction by that point.<br />
<br />
Just wanted to follow up on this and make sure everyone was clear that the full price is 250g and then faction discounts apply that reduce the price all the way down to 200g at exalted.<br />
<br />
Thanks and sorry for the mixup. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/20136595097-did-they-lower-riding-skill-costs-again.html))<br />

Diminishing Returns on Chains of Ice on PTRs<br />
Stop your mass rerolling there DKs; this is a bug. :)<br />
<br />
Chains of Ice should not have DR on its snare.<br />
<br />
The bug was likely introduced because we were trying to prevent the huge visual from displaying on creatures that were immune to the snare. The functionality of Chains of Ice has not changed for 3.3 (at least as of this posting.) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20131899996-chains-of-ice--diminishing-returns-on-ptr.html))<br />

Improved Barkskin now Grants 80% additional armor contribution from cloth and leather items. <br />

Well, there ya go.. now let's wait and see what kind of topics that will appear in the pvp forums at wow.<br />

Oh and - and only 1 class in 5 years, well thats a good thing. I mean, that their not going to fast just to make more classes as it exist big balance issues when adding a new class to the game and so on :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with you in a way. No good story can live happily ever after, because happily ever after is quite boring. In order for this to happen, things must change. Jaina and Thrall must always be one step away from happiness and never actually there. I suspect that with the end of Arthas' story, Jaina will tragically die as well. Would the Lich King kill Jaina? Would this have any effect on him? <br />
<br />
As for Cairne, I really hope he travels with Thrall. He has had such an unjustly boring role in WoW, he deserves to have his story taken forward, not ended.<br />
<br />
I must remind everyone that it was Cairne who won &quot;most loved faction leader&quot; during the valentines event, people do like that old cuddly softy! <br />

<br />
1. Because it's protected. Magic and stuff.<br />
2. Because not all NPCs can fly. The mass is ground infantry/cavalry. Remember, players alone are not able to kill the Lich King, he is fucking powerful! We need help. Also the walls hold back the &quot;simple masses&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know, this is a very good point. They did kinda try it with the opening of WOTLK, but it was such a half-assed attack. You have this enormous army of giant abominations, but send a bunch of skeletons and frostwyrms to attack instead.<br />
<br />
From the looks of it Cataclysm will do it much better, with the cities being destroyed and whatnot. Hopefully they'll get the hang of it.<br />
<br />
So far, I haven't really felt particularly driven to fight a villain in WoW. Not for any other reason than to get their loot. Not that there are no reasons, some are outright evil and threaten the world... but there's no feeling to it.</div></div><hr />

That's where im not sure what to hope for. If he travels with Thrall, he will end up as beef most likely. Remember the Goblins rescues Thrall at Echo islands in their starting zone in Cataclysm. No mention of Cairne being there aswelll.<br />
<br />
Maybe Cairne travels to Northrend and fights with the joint forces against the lich king?<br />
<br />
Maybe he goes to Northrend to become chieftan of the Taunka?<br />
<br />
or maybe, as suggested before hes killed in a traitoress action byt the Grimtotem/Garrosh plot.<br />
<br />
Guess we'll see.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Listen, he's an old cow. How far can his story go? If anyone needs their story advanced, it's Baine. It is the job of the young to take the place of the old. So I really do think he should be killed off. No better way to get people into the story than to get rid of a beloved character. And really, wouldn't the death of Cairne serve to define Baine rather well? I can just imagine the chip (cowchip? I crack myself up) Baine would have on his shoulder if his father were branded as a traitor and killed. So far, the Tauren have just been a little too &quot;perfect,&quot; and haven't had the chance to show what happens when they're crossed. After all, if Thrall were to cease to be the leader of the Horde and Cairne killed, the oath that binds the Tauren to the Horde would be null and void. Given the animosity that has been brewing within the Horde, I do wonder what this is all setting up toward. <br />
<br />
I also wonder if Varian's aggressive attitude is upsetting the balance within the Alliance as well? Given what is ahead for the Alliance in Cataclysm is almost entirely a mystery so far, who knows?</div></div><hr />

They go around trying to keep the Elementals under control, Thrall and Cairne are like Brothers and will most likely stick together. I highly doubt he gets killing by Garrosh. He might be a old cow but It's a game, and Last time I checked alot of the Main characters have like over 1000 years on them. So yeah.

This from the blue part :<br />
I will also say that while I have read a large number of rumors and speculation concerning what's to come, I haven't seen a single one that has the progresson of events or the reasons behind them correct. ;) <br />
<br />
I do see that there is some more real proof that Baine will replace Cairne, but it doesn't say anything on how Cairne will &quot;leave&quot; TB<br />
Sure he can die, but there's 6 million ways to die.<br />
It can also be that Garrosh, who sees orcs and tauren as the only real strong horde races, thinks cairne is getting to old and physically weak to be leader of TB and they agree for him to step down and let his younger and more fit son take over.<br />
So it could also be a way of leaving in a way of.. leaving, still alive, moving to some other place (maybe 2 steps to the back into the tent to watch his son lol) And again, there are loads of reasons why he would or how he could leave in a living way.</div></div><hr />

A lot of the dungeons in WOTLK tend to be really 'bright'. They don't have that spooky mystical feel to them that make exploration exciting. It also looks really big, which I personally love in WoW dungeons, because you kind of feel lost in them like in BRD or Maraudon. Sure the new way they style dungeons in a completely linear fashion is much easier but it's boring. Having twists and turns and hidden passages and special quests is much more exciting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This only states that no one has the COMPLETE story correct. Parts may still be correct, but everyone who claims that he knows what is going to happen is just incorrect. That's what the blue said. So maybe you *are* right..or maybe *they* are right. You don't know. They don't know. Only Blizzard knows (hopefully).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Akutare</div><div class="date">2009-10-06, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I must admit, I'm a little disappointed with the indication that Orgrimmar might not have the &quot;selective&quot; attitude to its inhabitants in Cata that was originally implied...internal persecution would definately add a impressive bolster to ongoing horde lore...although having say the AH discriminating against undead customers might create some problems :D <br />
<br />
<br />
They never said that other races were going to be banned from entering Orgrimmar. That was a product of people's failure to read and absorb details. They actually just said that only Orcs and Tauren would be considered powerful enough to protect the center of Orgrimmar. Now when they say it that way I kind of think they're implying the actual political center, currently the Valley of Wisdom but perhaps when Cataclysm hits Garrosh will move the seat of power to the literal middle of the Den of Shadows. Either way, I think this is more a sign that you won't see other races as guards and perhaps having any representatives in there. No more Vol'Jin or Blood Elves. <br />
<br />
Removing an entire capital for over half the races of a faction would not be a reasonable thing to do. It would just make Orgrimmar the least used city in the game because you couldn't meet customers there most of the time. It would mess up the holiday events, which granted they are probably going to be impacted anyhow, but brewfest would have to be entirely relocated if only orcs and tauren were allowed in Orgrimmar. All of the quests that require reporting to Orgrimmar would need alternatives scripted for three other races so the workload would be increased needlessly. There would be little point or perhaps no way of gaining reputation for other races with Orgrimmar because you buy the wolves inside Orgrimmar. Most of the Horde would be out a number of mounts or the option of getting them.<br />
<br />
The Horde already gets less reputations than the Alliance and starts at neutral with about half of their side at the start of the game whereas the Alliance is default friendly with everyone. Why make this worse by removing an entire capital city from use for half of the races?</div></div><hr />

Now, I know the quest has NOTHING to do with Desolace in the slightest, but I think that pretty much sums up where he will be going ;)<br />

They wouldn't dare kill off one of the most popular leaders that stands right now from the horde, he's just too damn good!<br />

<br />
<br />
That's because Desolace looks oh-so-sexy in Cataclysm compared to it's fairly dull, lifeless and insipid appearance at the moment.<br />
And from and Screenshots and Trailer, it seems as though there's a Tauren Camp situated there...<br />
<br />
However, could just be a bug *shrug*.</div></div><hr />

The new replacement quest (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/14440/rites-of-the-earthmother/) has the same issue. Perhaps just a weird glitch with the quest?</div></div><hr />

Kil'jaedan...Illidan....Arthas probably....It'd sort of be interesting though. I mean its basically only because of thrall that the trolls or tauren are even with the horde and then bloodelves/undead its kind of an alliance of need so they wont be teamed on by the alliance. The alliance seems alot more like an actual alliance you know &gt;_&gt;. The humans, dwarves, and gnomes have all been allied for quite some time. The night elves are unlikely to go anywhere although its a bit weird why they'd be at odds with the horde. Meanwhile Orcs+draenei...never gonna happen.</div></div><hr />
