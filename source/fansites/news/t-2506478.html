I just can't understand this....questing in retail is identical, it's the same shit over and over, go here and kill X or collect y, this is no different in classic. In fact, once you cross a certain point in retail, the questing stories per zone become very immersive...besides that tho, I never will understand why people get so hung up on the leveling process, what happens at endgame is what matters!! And tbh this is no different in classic, how is the world at 60 gonna be any different then 120? Same grinds to get ready for raid (actually alot more time consuming) there is waaaayyyyy less to do at 60 then there is at 120, I don't get how anyone can see that diff, sure, if you want to split hairs, the 120 grind is also....grindy, but the 60 grind is the same, you have limited endgame content that is very repetitive!!! Nothing changes except the social constructs!! Which is my final point....I think the main people really missed vanilla was the social game and the community, that's what this is about. To argue that 60 is more engaging and less repetitive than 120 is foolhardy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, questing has not been the same since at least Wrath. I know this because I completed the original Loremaster achievement before the change came in Cata. No, the journey through the content is what should matter. People made the endgame content matter more and more and Blizzard simply obliged. The grind at 60 was far different than the grind at 120, so different in fact, that you try to compare the two. One does not need to level talents and weapons skills and various other things. <br />
<br />
Rep, professions, are part of the norm. I guess we could compare Azerite skills to weapons skills, but at least with lower Azerite skills, one did not have to sit there and beat bore to death to level up a weapon to one-shot the beast. Besides, this an MMO, the entire purpose of the game is to be a grind the entire way through to the endpoint of the content. Without the grind at all, we might as well be playing a shooter or one of the other genres. You finally point is also a fallacy that many been selling for 15 years in this game. <br />
<br />
The community back then, I mean the whole community, not just the parts that some people chose to interact with and disregard the rest was garbage even back then. If one was a less skilled player they were treated like a plague. Ask a question and one would get a level of grief that would make them never want to ask another quest or even want to further engage another person unless that other person engaged them first. I know this first hand, because frankly when I started playing this game, which was the first-ever MMO game or game outside of the many single-player games I had played going back to Sega, Nintendo, and arcade games.<br />
<br />
I did not say anything about 60 be more or less engaging. Questing back then alone made the player explore and go on an adventure, journey through the content. That is not what retail has been since at least the middle of Wrath. Everything since has been reduced to making the quickest path possible to endgame content for those that only want to do endgame content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There’s a caveat in the description of “while also being the first to down...”. That little caveat means it’s not just first to 60, but first there as well as killing the bosses. <br />
There’s also the fact that it is being advertised as Method race to world first, meaning the entire guild, not just 1 person.<br />
It’s splitting hairs and based on a technicality in wording, but I’m sure it’s how it will be spun to compensate random players being 1st to level 60 before them.</div></div><hr />

Sponsors pay them so sponsors have benefit, not Method. Method is pretty much playing games because sponsors support them. They still just play games. What do they provide for their community? Nothing. Entertainment. Entertainment is also a need but not the one Method is great at.</div></div><hr />

Pst can you keep a secret? You can find groups through chat or guild and not use the LFG in retail! SHOCKING ISN'T IT. Also you can't use a boost unless you've already established a character the normal way, and seeing how I've been leveling characters for 15 years I should be able to skip it at this point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I pointed this out earlier too. People aren’t reading the entire topic, or not understanding if they are. It’s not just a race to world first, they added a caveat of also clearing the 1st raids to be released in this cycle.<br />
The goal isn’t just to hit 60, but to do that and clear the end content.</div></div><hr />

Since you can't exactly do much raiding without being level 60, might as well just say 'first to clear the raids' and not mention being level 60 at all, right?</div></div><hr />

Good luck with that, nobody else looks for groups that way.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the passive aggressive insult though, BFA kiddie :)</div></div><hr />

Oh, start FRESH? Nice. Considering new realms brought up for similar reasons now have queues, how many server hops can someone expect?<br />
<br />
They need a free transfer service up if they want to fix this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because it started as a race to 60, then Jokerd blew them all out so they moved the goalpost.</div></div><hr />

The first post mentioning this already has “first to 60 and clearing X raids.” Goalposts haven’t moved, they have been the same. <br />
That said, the person you replied to has a good point, why even bother mentioning first to 60 if they are including the raid clear.</div></div><hr />

No, they aren't a company. Companies have product or service. They don't. Companies provide a benefit for community. They don't.<br />

You can register dsnt mean you will be accepted. They have to check your books and a myriad of other things. Nice try again though.<br />
