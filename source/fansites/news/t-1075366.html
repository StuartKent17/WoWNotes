If you did it right, you probably could have 3-manned most of heroic Dragon Soul. I'd imagine they aren't going to like that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for whether or not any Retribution paladin over level 40 that logged on and happened to play the game should be banned for doing nothing that would've been out of the ordinary... ridiculous. The bans should go for those who 3-manned heroic raids or went from 0 to 2200 Arena rating. Those people were out to exploit, and did.<br />
<br />
Someone logging on and doing a single heroic run and being absolutely dumbstruck by hitting divine storm and watching everything fall over are not exploiters. That'd be like arresting someone for having a car whose computer system malfunctioned and the car auto-accelerated into another car. They are simply not liable for happening to encounter a serious malfunction during normal gameplay.</div></div><hr />

Their's a line here. If the pally learns of this bug and takes their guild to 8/8 and/or earns an insane rating in PvP then yeah, might be B&amp;.<br />

<br />
I don't think anyone is asking why they fixed it. Using 24 people with 1 not saved to LFR all in a guild to exploit repeated gear gains is ridiculously different than doing LFR and random BGs and stomping meters without gaining gear from it while doing your normal rotation.<br />
<br />
Also, US and EU guilds were banned in the LFR incident, and both US and EU servers got the ret bug. I really don't understand your point.</div></div><hr />

If this dmg output was achieved through an unorthodox rotation that previously gained no advantage but during this bugs lifespan multiplied DPS, then this is knowingly realising a bug, and continuining to use it, outside of the normal way you play the class, would be exploiting.Blizzard however cannot expect guilds and players to stop doing content or playing, to wait for a bug fix, if it occured through the normal play style of a ret paladin.Now if a guild just stacked all their DPS as Ret and burst heroic modes, yeah, thats exploiting, and would not suprise me if they got banned and rightly so</div></div><hr />

Tonight, I had the most fun that I've had in a few months. I now know the glory days of Paladins bombing bosses for infinite. It came at a time when I was stressed out, pissed off, and 2 steps shy of ragequitting for the night... <br />
<br />
So, Blizzard. Take my gear. Take my levels. Take my account access away for a few days. But you'll never take away my memories of rushing into the first boss in BRC, telling the group, &quot;Hey guys, watch this!!&quot; as I pulled the boss and all the adds. <br />

Judging from this, I don't see how they're going to tell who exploited beyond the obvious arena rankings, looks like everyone that was going to raid as ret still did. The WoL rankings are gonna be busted the rest of the expansion though, unless they delete all logs involving a ret paladin.</div></div><hr />

The funny thing is they didn't fix everything... My Bone-Link Fetish now has NO ICD (use to be around 27-28 seconds). As in it proc'd 4 times instantly for 210k damage, they all crit... I killed both arena partners in 2 seconds, in a 2v2. I'm pretty sure all trinkets that have some sort of ICD are now broken, unless this is just for ret paladins... Which I doubt.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CailinUaigneach</div><div class="date">2012-02-02, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Man, some of you sure are dumb. Is every single ret paladin that logged in and killed something with the bug going to be punished? NO. The ones that learned of the bug and then said &quot;hey guild lets go down 8/8 while I'm OP&quot; will be. I read lots of posts of guilds that sat their ret paladins tonight because of this bug. They are the smart ones. Anyone who said &quot;YAY, lets down the bosses we're suck on&quot; is stupid. Even if it wasn't &quot;against the rules&quot; why would you even want a kill this way? What kind of accomplishment is it to kill something while exploiting a bug? <br />
<br />
Those of you saying how can Blizz punish people for just logging in and playing? Well, because it's kind of like when someone in front of you drops say a 20 dollar bill. You could take it and keep it and know its wrong. Or you could do what you know is right and hand it back to them. No one is going to be punished for saying &quot;OMG cool&quot; and going and whacking on some 5m dungeon boss for kicks. Those that use it to further progress their character and/or guild will be because they know what they're doing is wrong yet they are doing it anyway. <br />
<br />
Does this suck for raiding ret paladins? Without a doubt. But it is what it is and I think the little children will get along just fine without being able to raid for one night.<br />
<br />
And those of you wondering how something like this could happen and &quot;why can't they fix it in 20 minutes like other shit?&quot; Well, have you ever tried to program anything in your life? Probably not. It's not exactly as easy as erasing and re-writing something. Some problems are more complex than others, and sometimes it's going to take a lot longer to fix than other things.</div></div><hr />

My guess is that there won't be much sanctioning. Unless it's pretty clear that people discover there's a bug and still keep playing (like do 10 Arena's in succession with insane damage).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only really log on to raid. Didn't really notice any dps issues until we hit slime boss. First lot of slimes included a black that of course went through. Through on cleave seal and hit divine storm, entire raid freezes up and I end up pulling 1,460,000 dps. Was a solid wtf moment, but as we only raid DS one night a week I wasn't going to sit out just because they made a mistake. Ended up pulling massive dps up until our current progression and calling it.<br />
Just don't be surprised if the gear you earned that night (for the entire raid) is gone, if you knew about it beforehand you should have either told them or stepped down or something otherwise if the gear from that night is removed then you wasted your time.<br />
<br />
Just saying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thing is its kinda strange since it didn't start happening after the latest patch but almost 2 days later it just suddenly kicked in. First I heard it someone in guild did Baradin Hold and was saying how a ret in the group did over 100k dps. I jumped on my pally alt and went to the dummies and damage was normal so I didn't think much about it. Then it was time for guild raid, we were doing DS 25m heroic running with our 2 normal pallies and their dps was completely normal. Meanwhile people in guild chat are linking 100-200-300k+ dps from recount in LFR.<br />
<br />
During half time raid break one of our pallies goes into a battleground and reports back that his damage is like 10 times higher than normal. He comes back into raid and his dps was back to normal. Anyway after raid just for lols we did LFR as a guild with 3 of our rets and they all got 200k+ dps. Not long after the realm went down.<br />
<br />
So weird this bug just starts 2 days after a patch for no reason, then it only works in certain situations for some people.</div></div><hr />

Is every single ret paladin that logged in and killed something with the bug going to be punished? NO. The ones that learned of the bug and then said &quot;hey guild lets go down 8/8 while I'm OP&quot; will be. I read lots of posts of guilds that sat their ret paladins tonight because of this bug. They are the smart ones. Anyone who said &quot;YAY, lets down the bosses we're suck on&quot; is stupid. Even if it wasn't &quot;against the rules&quot; why would you even want a kill this way? What kind of accomplishment is it to kill something while exploiting a bug? <br />
<br />
Those of you saying how can Blizz punish people for just logging in and playing? Well, because it's kind of like when someone in front of you drops say a 20 dollar bill. You could take it and keep it and know its wrong. Or you could do what you know is right and hand it back to them. No one is going to be punished for saying &quot;OMG cool&quot; and going and whacking on some 5m dungeon boss for kicks. Those that use it to further progress their character and/or guild will be because they know what they're doing is wrong yet they are doing it anyway. <br />
<br />
Does this suck for raiding ret paladins? Without a doubt. But it is what it is and I think the little children will get along just fine without being able to raid for one night.<br />
<br />
And those of you wondering how something like this could happen and &quot;why can't they fix it in 20 minutes like other shit?&quot; Well, have you ever tried to program anything in your life? Probably not. It's not exactly as easy as erasing and re-writing something. Some problems are more complex than others, and sometimes it's going to take a lot longer to fix than other things.<br />
<br />
And those are the same guys whining that top guilds should be banned for the LFR exploit while it never affected them.</div></div><hr />

This was clearly a minor HOTFIX that broke something. Hotfix = can go live when the servers are live. This wasn't happening YESTERDAY. I don't see where Blizzard would be banning anyone aside from the most grievous of exploiters, where people were KNOWINGLY and INTENTIONALLY doing things to create huge advances for themselves. And I'm not talking about soloing a heroic dungeon or having a bit of fun in LFR, but a guild who would bench all but ret pallies, and then go 8/8 heroic DS, or an arena pally who went 10/10, or a group of RBG pallies who went 10/10. Kicking the face of LFR in...people were doing that already WITHOUT a bug helping them. I don't see where playing the game in a normal manner, with a hilarious bug should be bannable. It's just those who really saw it as an opportunity to make huge advances for themselves that should be actioned.</div></div><hr />

The correct thing to do is benching them for doing anormal dps. We're not talking about +2k, +5k... every time a bug like this happens, you report and don't use it for personal gain.<br />
<br />
Some bugs are really hard to notice, but one like this... lol<br />
<br />
Funny fact is that I didn't see anything like that with my paladin. How exactly this bug happened? Bugged &quot;+dmg&quot; proc trinkets (like fetish)? Divine Storm? Divine Storm + proc trinkets combo?<br />
<br />
Yesterday I only logged on my pally to do the daily random bg for the 100 conquest and my usual MC run for the bindings since the guild my pally is in just finished 8/8 normal on tuesday (wich btw, finally dropped the last one, weird huh? lol) and everything was normal, both for the 8/8 on tuesday and the bg+mc run. I don't have any of those proc trinkets, also do not use divine storm in random bgs, only in a few bosses in MC i do use it... but let's face it, they die so fast alread at 85 with DS gear... no use to be a freak checking recount for that... lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I don't know the exact details as most pallies experienced lag every single time they did it, but people were fairly sure it had to do with a combo of Seal of Truth, Seals of Command (the talent that makes you cleave) and divine storm.<br />
<br />
Basically the standard AOE rotation resulted in an explosion of DPS that made no sense.<br />
<br />
In all likelihood, something was proccing from a proc, from a proc, from a proc and so forth - probably resulting in a full on infinite loop. Numbers aren't any higher, because (as evidenced by the lag) the &quot;squirt of DPS&quot; actually has a cutoff point where the server (and you computer) doesn't understand it anymore, and automatically stops it.<br />
<br />
But since it's part of a standard rotation, and is largely fixed on most servers (if not all at this point) - I don't see every pally player above lvl 39 getting banned for this.</div></div><hr />

It looks like he quoted the wrong person.<br />
<br />
Anyways, a bug cropped up earlier yesterday evening involving Ret Paladins with the Seals of Command talent (I believe).<br />
<br />
Basically, Seal of Righteousness and Truth procced literally hundreds of times per second to the point of creating hundreds of thousands of DPS. For example, we went into ICC for shits and giggles to see how bad it was. I Divine Stormed Blood Council with Seal of Righteousness up and did 2.5 million DPS, and Seal of Righteousness hit over 47 thousand times in about 15 seconds.<br />
<br />
It...it was crazy.</div></div><hr />

Far too fast for every number to appear on your screen, and the only way to notice you are the one doing the insane damage in your raid is if you are running recount/skada or live updating your logs. If you play the game the way blizzard meant you to play it (default everything, no addons) you can't know the scale of YOUR dps in a 25m raid. They can't call this exploitation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was more like 4 hours, but that's not even the main issue right now... The fact is trinkets with a chance on proc have literally ZERO ICD. My Bone-Link Fetish procs 4-5 times in 1 second for up to 200-240k damage, I killed both partners in a 2v2 arena within 2 seconds of the game starting because of it. It's accounting for 20% of my damage right now in pve... I don't think this is just with ret paladins either.</div></div><hr />

Given it's the first week of the nerfs, a lot of people are going to be pushing for new content (or facerolling it at 200k DPS as it may be). I'm inclined to say something like this should have been fixed sooner, or just straight up never happened.

An exploit is an exploit. It does not matter how easy it is to use and if it is a part of normal rotation or not.<br />
If you know it is a bug and you use it to gain something like high arena rating, easy loot or things like that, you are exploiting and need to be ready to face sanctions.</div></div><hr />

The issue isnt the fact the bug was there, its that guilds have used it to get new kills/easier loot. They knowingly continued as normal, even having it glaringly obvious what was wrong. Nobody will miss a Ret doing 250k DPS.<br />

Just like Ensidia and LK normal, knowingly continuing when something has bugged out will be met with consequences.</div></div><hr />

As I said, it can be argued that one may not notice at least for the 1st boss and do it accidentally. Therefore it might be fairer to erase any progress automatically.<br />
<br />
However, I wouldn't find it extreme if the issued bans if they detected a blatant use of it after the 1st boss. I mean, really, how thick do you have to be if you see Morchok dropping in 20 seconds and think of it as 'normal'?</div></div><hr />

Euh... Blizzard as service provider needs to make sure they dont put flaws in their designs, and when they do, they should be humble about it, apologise to their paying customers, and get it repaired asap. Not threaten sanction against them for doing the exact same thing they would have done should the bug not have been introduced - play the game they're paying for.</div></div><hr />

To be fair, Morchok is the red-headed step-child of DS, and he should be expected to fall over. It shouldn't be an issue unless you fight one of the actual bosses, not the loot pinata at the entrance.<br />

You honestly think that no Retribution Paladins on the PTR tried attacking anything, and so none of them noticed they were doing 250,000 DPS? Seems far more likely the bug only appeared on live servers.</div></div><hr />

Those who &quot;suddenly&quot; went and got max arena rating, those that stacked 10 pallies and one shot all of ds heroic etc. Ones who knowingly and purposely used the bug to get ahead.If a guild has a ret pally, and they happened to be in the raid, blizz cannot expect them to step down, or not use a CORE ability for a NORMAL rotation.</div></div><hr />

We had two ret paladins in our raid last night, killing Heroic Zon'ozz after working for several hours, then killing Yor'sajh and heroic Hagara. We did not see anything out of the ordinary with our paladins.<br />
<br />
So this &quot;We can't help it&quot; response, I just don't buy it.<br />
Look, my ret paladin is noob (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/feathermoon/Elliora/advanced) - I don't play her much, and I've been devoting her jeeps &amp; veeps to tank gear because that's what I really want to do. My rotation is pretty much just mashing whatever button lights up because I don't care - I'm just trying to gear up enough so I don't need to queue as DPS anymore. And...<br />
http://i41.tinypic.com/2dadjlt.jpg<br />
I'd hit Divine Storm, my computer would freeze, and when it unfroze the mobs would be dead and my recount meter looked like this. I have no idea WTF I'm doing - I certainly was not TRYING to do anything to exploit. I honestly thought that recount was broken and my stupid computer was making me miss the fight. It wasn't until another ret paladin joined and everyone in the raid was complaining about lagging computers that I figured out that there wasn't a problem with my computer but with the game itself.<br />
<br />
I hope to God I don't get banned for something that was hardly my fault, especially since I submitted a ticket as soon as I left the raid. :S</div></div><hr />

A bug like that is Blizzard's problem, not mine. I sincerely doubt the damage done (no pun intended) by this bug is so nonsignificant that bans are actually not warranted. If people killed heroic deathwing with paladins, well, they would have anyway without them next week, and their arena ratings will drop very fast too once they need to use their actual (lack of..) skill once the fix went live. Not to mention that by the looks of it the bug hasn't been live that long either, so room for actual exploiting (WTS Arena rating!!) probably didn't exist. Meh. People overreact.</div></div><hr />

Again this was as the result of a HOTFIX.<br />
<br />
Hotfixes are only EVER tested internally, and oftentimes are pushed to live without a full range of testing occuring. This is usually because there's a small error or tweak that needs fixing - however if ONE NUMBER is wrong, this can be the result. (so let's say two people were working on the hotfix, one fixing something for shamans, one trying to figure out why ret pally DPS wasn't working the way it should - the shaman guy saves the file, hotfixes it - and puts a pally buff on live that he wasn't even looking for - and why would he look? He was dealing with Shaman abilities!) It's actually remarkable that this nonsense doesn't happen more often!<br />
<br />
But even so - there's a SOLID difference between &quot;having some fun&quot; and &quot;exploiting the hell out of something&quot;. Going in and soloing some old content just to see the extent of the bug? That's one thing. Going into heroic DS with 8 ret pallys...? That's exploiting. <br />
<br />
People who have played this game for more than a few months (especially those who raid or PVP hardcore) KNOW the results of playing with a bug like this in anything but the most innocent of ways. Anyone who went &quot;let's just get some loot by bringing everyone's pally in&quot; should know better.<br />
<br />
I only forsee bannings for people who were using this bug to do progression in really obvious ways. People who went solo-mount-farming? That's small beans.</div></div><hr />

They're not using an absurd spec or obscure items or anything. Their abilities are just broken. As it stands now, if blizzard accidentally makes warriors crit on every auto-attack, I can get banned for logging on and doing anything. That's just not fair.</div></div><hr />

Even if only a fraction of all these used this bug to progress further in raiding / farm arena rating, that's gonna be a lot of work for Blizz to go through every case of exploiting, remove the gear they or their guildies may have obtained and roll back achievements and arena rating.<br />

(so let's say two people were working on the hotfix, one fixing something for shamans, one trying to figure out why ret pally DPS wasn't working the way it should - the shaman guy saves the file, hotfixes it - and puts a pally buff on live that he wasn't even looking for - and why would he look? He was dealing with Shaman abilities!) It's actually remarkable that this nonsense doesn't happen more often!<br />
<br />
But even so - there's a SOLID difference between &quot;having some fun&quot; and &quot;exploiting the hell out of something&quot;. Going in and soloing some old content just to see the extent of the bug? That's one thing. Going into heroic DS with 8 ret pallys...? That's exploiting. <br />
<br />
People who have played this game for more than a few months (especially those who raid or PVP hardcore) KNOW the results of playing with a bug like this in anything but the most innocent of ways. Anyone who went &quot;let's just get some loot by bringing everyone's pally in&quot; should know better.<br />
<br />
I only forsee bannings for people who were using this bug to do progression in really obvious ways. People who went solo-mount-farming? That's small beans.<br />
<br />
Sorry but your example about blizzard is just silly; something like that is completely impossible in a company like blizzard - this isn't two prodigy's working in a basement on a massive project; it's massive amounts of highly educated experts working on patches for one 7yeard old game. If they can't guarantee patches are unflawed without testing them, they need to test them before releasing them. That's just common sence.<br />
<br />
I fully agree that if people did stuff like what you say, take 8 retri's to progress in DS heroics, that's an exploit and merrits sanctioning. But what about a guild that has been stuck on ultraxion hc for 3 weeks and have now killed it in their first attempt because of this bug? Are they exploiting? Not in my opinion - they are doing the exact same thing they would be doing if the bug had not been introduced.<br />
<br />
If sanctions are limited to people who actively exploited like your example, i have no objections, but i'm still wondering where the apology is from blizzard for allowing bugged content to reach live servers when the bug is so obnoxiously obvious.<br />

Seems you have some trouble reading.<br />
<br />
&quot;How exactly do you propose that they fix problems which do not exist until it is released on the live servers?&quot;<br />
<br />
Your answer is &quot;Test it on the test-realm&quot;.<br />
<br />
So they should test the bug which was not there on the test realm...on the test realm.<br />
<br />
That is your suggestion.<br />
<br />
Sigh... If they would have private servers running the exact same game version as is on live, and they introduced this patch, the bug would manifest itself identically to how it does on live. &quot;No it was impossible to see; only on live&quot; - right... That's really not how it works with class-mechanic-bugs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those servers running the exact same version of the game as is going on live? They have those. They are called the Test Realm. Shockingly, testing something on a single server specifically made for it with all new characters or ones copied directly over is different than releasing it on dozens of different servers with thousands of different characters on them. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;No it was impossible to see; only on live&quot; - right... That's really not how it works with class-mechanic-bugs.<br />
<br />
And that really is how it works with bugs. As you can see, in this patch. Bugs which affect a specific class are not magically different. Or how about you look at the other bugs which also only appeared on live and were never there in the Test Realm beforehand, with previous patches. Like when Ulduar was released and for no apparent reason loads of people had talent points simply disappear. Or when they released Icecrown and the bridge to the Airship at the end of the last 5man caused everyone to disconnect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, it is different, but a class-mechanic-bug that manifests itself on every live realm it is released on, would also manifest itself on private servers that are running the exact same game-version as live servers do.<br />
<br />
<br />
And that really is how it works with bugs. As you can see, in this patch. Bugs which affect a specific class are not magically different.

<br />
Which is why i specifically mentioned &quot;class-mechanic-bugs&quot;; these have nothing to do with connectivity, or operating systems - it is simply an erroneous calculation on blizzard's servers - which would also manifest itself on private servers running identical game versions.<br />
<br />

<br />
It was the same thing with LFR. It was not working as intended and everyone knew. It may be accidential once but if you do it a second time it is exploiting a bug. <br />
<br />
The same goes for raids. If you killed trash with a bugged pally that's fine but you HAD to realize that something was wrong right there. If you proceeded to kill a boss you are an exploiter. Plain and simple. If you then proceeded to kill more bosses then you WILL get banned and the loot from your guild will be taken if they don't get banned with you too.<br />
<br />
But hey if you hoestly did notice and killed one boss then make a ticket to Blizz right after and tell them you didn't realize with a plea to not ban you. And maybe you will run into an understanding GM who will not ban you and your guild. <br />
<br />
Furthermore don't play that character until it's fixed and ask for a 2 day refund on your playtime. Blizz will also likely do this.<br />
<br />
The ret paladins in my guild immediately opted to not raid to not get themselves and our guild banned. If they hadn't done so our RL would have sat them. If our RL hadn't sat them then I wouldn't have joined the raid.<br />
<br />
So yes everyone that took part in a bosskill in DS with a ret pally deserves a ban or at least his gear taken away. <br />
<br />
If you see a bank vault open with no security whatsoever and decide to take the money and spread it around to bystanders that see what you are doing then all of you go to jail. Plain and simple.</div></div><hr />

Well..first of all..to rent a server (or buy one actually) is cheap..so cheap, even a person can afford that (with support, with whatsoever...) The &quot;single server specifically made for it with all new characters or ones copied directly over is different than releasing it on dozens of different servers with thousands of different characters on them. &quot; is a complete bullshit...A testserver MUST BE exactly the same environment like the live..(have you ever heard mission critical level? Luckily the blizz programmers does not works in that area...) otherwise it`s just a waste of time..For my money I don`t want to be a bloody betatester....</div></div><hr />

Funnily enough ppl did this with the LFR ... Noticed they got gear they shouldn't have, created ticket, destroyed the piece of gear in question and still they got banned for it.

Yes, yes totally. Hey guys I didnt realize I was pulling 200k dps until all of H DS was dead. Me so sorry now.<br />
Also all those people that have 700,000 fish caught on their accounts have just 9 year old relative that love fishing for 16 hrs a day 365 days a year on their account. <br />
<br />
Damn Blizzard, you who can see the logs and the tickets; why can you not be fair?!<br />
<br />
Also Blizz once auto banned me for &quot;gold selling&quot; (anyone remember the watchdog that autoflagged for certain trades?) when I traded my friend 100k to buy a TCG mount off the AH. <br />
<br />
1 call =&gt; Account restored and 1 day additional playtime. So yes clearly this is too much effort.</div></div><hr />

Using 24 people with 1 not saved to LFR all in a guild to exploit repeated gear gains is ridiculously different than doing LFR and random BGs and stomping meters without gaining gear from it while doing your normal rotation.<br />
<br />
Also, US and EU guilds were banned in the LFR incident, and both US and EU servers got the ret bug. I really don't understand your point.<br />
<br />
Using 24 people with 1 not saved was not the the extend of the exploit as far as I know. KIN raiders actually did something similar and didn't get banned.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: How did you farm and prepare to clear DS?<br />
A: As many people know, US &amp; EU had some troubles involving LFR. As for us, we brought 3 mains that did not overlap with each others' tier drops and 23 alts that have already done LFR, which facilitated the gearing of our mains. All in all, each member has gone through LFR about 26 times.<br />
<br />
(Personal note: I think he meant to say 22 alts)<br />

We were thinking &quot;lol retardadin with RF up&quot; until I pulled up Skada. He did like 212,000 DPS.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ticketed blizzard, gave times/date/names, hopefully he gets a mini vacation.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, lol at http://www.worldoflogs.com/rankings/players/Dragon_Soul/dps/ especially the 25 LFR. top 10 on every fight are Ret Pallies, except for 2 mages on Spine<br />
<br />
So what are ret pallies supposed to do then? Not play?</div></div><hr />

Or play another specc. Unless that's their only specc and/or character they have, then continue on with full acknowledgement that they're exploiting.<br />

No, they don't. 4.3 is prime example ... they knew about the bug but gave community pass on it just to ban them for it week later. And if I make a bug which effect I can reverse, I don't go fuck my clients for abusing it. I just inform them about it and reverse it's effect. They are paying customers after all and because of the reverse I effectively nullify a lot of time they spent &quot;using the game not as intended&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Accidentally? Yeah, it was just coincidence that everyone that killed the boss passed on the loot from the boss, which was required for the &quot;accidental looter&quot; to be able to loot it.</div></div><hr />

I am not talking about that. If you joined raid in progress through lfr and there was loot left on one of the bosses because nobody wanted it, you ran by it ... saw option to loot ... did so and bam, you just exploited a bug.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty sure these people will be the ones getting bans and their kills being reversed. Someone nuking a load of heroics probably won't be affected unless they hoard achievements.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Also how lazy/rubbish do you have to be to say, well we will fix it tomorrow. So for tonight can you try not to abuse please? <br />
<br />
Surely it's more work to ban/reverse achievements/gear tomorrow than just roll-back to the last change? Server restart now, or investigations for the next few days? Maybe they don't have the manpower for the community anymore :P But hey, Star Wars is excellent :D</div></div><hr />

Post from 11/23/2011 : <br />
Twice today I saw a looting bug where the people who won the items left, or didn't click the boss. After a wipe, somebody else came in and picked up the items. In one case, I was able to pick up a Warr Hunt Shaman tier token from a boss which I shouldn't have been eligible to loot at all (second time killing him).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc5fedf265c1</div><div class="date">2012-02-02, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know, you'd think, given the number of expert software engineers who frequent the forums here at MMOC, that there would be a lot more games on the market that weren't risible garbage.<br />
<br />
Honestly, the pitchfork-waving witch-hunt that happens here every single time a bug makes it to live realms is really getting pretty tiresome. The Dunning-Kruger effect is truly in full swing in this thread.<br />
<br />
Firstly I have to agree with this guy, even the best engineers and software companies f**ck up sometimes, if they are really unlucky that makes it to the history books (I remind OS/3 to some of you who are old enough to remember it). It is easy to talk like that and disrespect the effort made by those people everyday. I would express myself negatively about the strategic decisions made by blizzard for this game, not the failures that come from loose bugs.<br />
<br />
Secondly I would like to say that the use of math in this supposedly (Massive Multyplayer Online) RPG is really sickening. I really hate the whole circus act in this game which forces you to focus on stuff like this: &quot;Push this button, then jump, then push that button 3 times, then wait then push this button&quot;, etc. The same thing goes for most raid boss encounters &quot;Move there, then turn, then jump on that ramp, then get out of green shit, then go back and start over&quot;. We are being handled as lab rats, this isn't Role Playing. Anyone who has ever played DnD will tell you, you need some math for the random part of the game, but other than that you should be able to enjoy exploring a whole new world, the lore, the graphical art, the emulation of physics, everything that makes a virtual world wonderful to experience. And encounters should really be more about using your mind than playing guitar hero in a blizzard environment. The fact that I 'm somewhat used to it after 5 years doesn't mean I don't hate it. I catch myself sometimes not paying attention to the environement of the game when doing an instance or raid but rather focusing on instrumentation and pushing the buttons as I 'm supposed to.. It 's not fun, not as much as wondering in the external environments, listening to the sounds and music admiring the view and suddenly getting jumped by wondering mobs and fighting for survival.<br />
So events like this bug appearing are really welcome from my point of view. They move the waters a bit and we can may see a little more clearly again where the real fun comes from in a game, instead of racing for gear, guild progression and other stupid competitive stuff. Somewhere along the line I believe the marketing team in blizzard messed up and we are just to addicted to the game to admit it. <br />
I don't believe they should ban anyone, they should shut up, put their heads down, and go filter out those logs. When they do that, removing gear acquired is easy, and so is fixing the source of data for all the logging tools (which are really pointless from my point of view, you guys are only complaining because you can't brag about it to your buddies anymore? not very mature to begin with).</div></div><hr />

You obviously don't raid. Ofc it is fucking retarded if some guild manages to outpreform your own because their ret pala does 500k on tendons or whatever.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard is already faced with declining subscriptions, you REALLY THINK that they're going to ban tens of thousands (or more) of players to add to that problem? No. They won't. They'll give out a few warnings, and maybe a few dozen bans at most, probably to isolated people who really abused it for 2200+ arena ratings or high end heroic content. I've seen more game breaking mechanics in the past years such as the infamous &quot;steam tonk controller&quot; flag cap exploit go unpunished despite knowing many people who did it. So, no, don't expect many, if any rets to get banned from this. and no, I don't play a ret paladin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's Blizzard's fault for this bug. You can't tell people they can't play their class/spec just because Blizzard screwed up.<br />
<br />
Of course, it's always Blizzard's fault when someone Exploits. By that standard, every criminal that breaks the law should be let off, because it's someone's else fault they were able to commit the crime.<br />
<br />
We raided last night with our usual Ret pally. Nothing special happen, maybe we missed the window. I think when you're doing 227,000 DPS, you know something is wrong. To say &quot;Oh look, I went from 40K DPS to 200k DPS, Blizzard's fault !&quot; it just trying to play the innocent victim card.</div></div><hr />

True - but if you gain a boss kill for the first time by using this exploit, it is. Btw I'm not sure but I don't think it is the normal rotation because our ret pala doesn't do idiotic dmg</div></div><hr />

Allow me to come up with a more relevant example. You go to the shop and buy a bunch of items. You pay £10 for the items but the cashier gives you £100 in change by accident. Morality says you should give them the money back, however you are not a criminal if you don't. It wasn't you that made the mistake.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Ensidia were banned for using an obscure exploit. And it was always debated whether they did it deliberately. If they were telling the truth and they didn't know what was causing the exploit, they shouldn't have been banned. This was however for a world first, not a world 5000th.</div></div><hr />

and because why is arena so different from pve? i'll give you a tip: it is not! punish everyone who (ab)used it, or do not punish anybody. don't try to argue that &quot;killing that boss does not count; he used his normal rotation. but that 2200 score in arena. oha. ban him hard. pure intention!&quot; is reasonable.</div></div><hr />

Afraid I disagree, Blizzard didn't hand you something. A mistake was made (a door was left open) and people came on in. Believe it or not, I'm not required by law to lock my doors. Having my door unlocked doesn't mean you're free to enter at will.<br />
<br />
You see people doing 25man Heroic MoD with the Pally exploit. Those aren't baddies just logging in and being confused. I would have thought by now anyone who in any ways follows what's going on in wow would have learned from the earlier bans that &quot;I just played what I was dealt&quot; isn't an excuse Blizzard is going to accept. Sure some folks didn't know better, But the ones logging to WoL, especially the 25man Heroic guilds. Knew better and choose to test their luck.<br />
<br />
Personally I don't care if they are banned or just get a stern look. Only thing I disagree with strongly is this, &quot;I'm just a victim here!&quot; excuse some will try to use. Only reason I'd like to see Ban, is so all you kids that think it's OK to use an exploit will get the message that it's &quot;Not Cool&quot; and &quot;it's Blizzard fault!&quot; isn't going to fly. You see something wrong, you open a ticket to report the bug.</div></div><hr />

I'd get a huge combustion off and spread it to a pack of ads, my dps would go through the roof, until the ret palys would kick in and pull like 5x my dps, lagging everyone's connection for a couple seconds. It was hilarious. I was trying to get them to pull multiple groups of ads but the tanks were being no fun.<br />
<br />
LFR is a perfect venue for crap like this - who cares if people are exploding the meters with a bug in LFR, it's not like we ever fail to down every single boss in there. LFR is a loot pinata and everyone knows it. Downing heroic bosses with it is a very big obvious ban though. Even just downing normal mode bosses with this bug is asking for a ban, it's just common sense.</div></div><hr />

Especially a bug like this which basically means that if you do nothing wrong, log on your as every other day, play your spec as every other day, you can get banned because there was a bug. That does seem harsh on the average WoW player. If you went in and cleared 7 new heroic bosses with 7 ret paladins in your 10man raid, then sure ban them, but I really don't hope they ban any regular ret paladin just playing his class. Imagine sitting in that situation, if I play my class, I get banned, if I don't, well then I can't play the game I'm paying for.</div></div><hr />

We raided last night with our usual Ret pally. Nothing special happen, maybe we missed the window. I think when you're doing 227,000 DPS, you know something is wrong. To say &quot;Oh look, I went from 40K DPS to 200k DPS, Blizzard's fault !&quot; it just trying to play the innocent victim card.<br />
<br />
Dude in this case you are being a huge ass. This bug procs no matter what due to paladin rotation depends on having his seals up. Sooo it really blizzard's fault. No matter what that pally will be doin insane amounts of dps because he must dps in order to stay in the raid. What you are asking is for that pally to not dps and just sit there and then get kicked for not doin his job. Its like if blizz missed a glitch where Deathstrike bubbled for 100% of the DK's health from one use. Do you expect DKs not to use their main dmg mitigation move because of a screw up due to bad programming?</div></div><hr />

All you do is go watch a regular paladin attacking video and then pretend he's doing retarded amount of damage, because that's what the bug is. Ret paladins just play their class exactly how it's supposed to be and the bug just happens, not like anyone is doing it on purpose.</div></div><hr />

Just to nitpick, you're quoting the wrong episode. The &quot;overlords&quot; quote is from when Homer is in space and the ship is full of ants, your quote's from the 1996 Treehouse of Horror that had Bob Dole and Bill Clinton taken over by Kang and Kodos.<br />

OT: Who wants to be there will be massive pally QQ about the &quot;unjustified&quot; bans once they get what they deserve?</div></div><hr />

Oh, lord. That's a terrible analogy.<br />
<br />
<br />
I play a holy Paladin. Back in Firelands, I would somehow bug and my heals would be duplicated, so it made some of our runs trivial.<br />
<br />
Did I suddenly stop healing in the middle of a fight because I was worried I was going to get banned? No.<br />
<br />
It's Blizzard's fault it was happening. Could I explain how it was happening? No.<br />
<br />
So should I have gotten banned for just simply playing the game normally and randomly getting bugged without knowing what I was doing?</div></div><hr />

That's how I feel as well. We have a raid tonight, we are 10 people, nothing more, nothing less. One of the 10 people is a ret paladin. With the bug in place (which luckly seems fixed now) should we have not raided? Or had the ret tank, and have our main tank log an alt to DPS (as he does not have dps gear, since we give that to teh ret paladin!)?<br />
<br />
Now I'm happy not to be in this situation, but had it come down to it, I'd probably have jsut dont it with the ret. Can't change the plans of 10 people because of a bug that there is absolutely no way not to abuse (maybe swapping seal and doing suboptimal dps? would make progressing fun...)</div></div><hr />

I am rather shocked by all the classes that are actually not bugged. Pretty damn onesided stuff (Fire Mages, Rogues, Frost DKs...) regarding the non-lfr stuff (primarily 25 heroic).</div></div><hr />

Obviously that is what Blizz is thinking. But I guess you have 1 shot for free if you keep on playing (I guess some ppl who play dont read forums or are interested in deeper stuff at all) &quot;abusing&quot; a bug - by normal playing \o/- you, your raid and what not will getting banned,removed,killed and raped irl.</div></div><hr />

No if you continue and pretend its ok a ban obv. is warranted. Everyone knows that dps increasing by 400% is not supposed to happen.</div></div><hr />

People are relating to using the bug vs the integrity of the man, like we're Kings and Queens righteously ruling our Kingdoms; while other players are arguing that the bug was harmless fun. Overall what was really affected? Some people got rolled in PvP, and some bosses died in PvE. The world didn't end, or was irrefutably damaged (and by the world I don't mean WoW).There was a bug in the game and most people had fun with it. We all knew it was going to be fixed, and honestly, it was so late in the evening a large majority of the game probably wasn't even affected. Honestly, THIS MOMENT, this 5-6 hours moment is what Cata will be remembered for. Not the crap content or terribly dumbed down / over inflated PvP system, but this 5-6 hour block where people actually had legitimate fun.</div></div><hr />

Basically. They expect you not to stack ret pallies to down heroic content you couldn't down without te bug.. I don't think they care about LFR or normal. But you old imagine guilds taking seven rets and downing content out of their league for server firsts, etc.</div></div><hr />

I think there's a bit of a difference in doing 40% more dps than the next highest on certain fights compared to doing 300%-500% more dps than others on every fight.</div></div><hr />
