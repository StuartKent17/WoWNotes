<br />
They also block your normal+ set bonuses, and normal is out for WEEKS before LFR. If you need LFR gear to progress, you're probably either doing it wrong or part of the intended audience for LFR.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As Dawnshadow said, LFR stuff comes out weeks after normal/heroic/mythic. I couldn't see any benefit right now (as a warrior at least) to have 100 strength over enrage procs via raging blow (factoring in of course the gear differences and stat differences)<br />
<br />
Think of it like dungeon sets back in Vanilla but not class-exclusive this time.</div></div><hr />

I hope so...I used to be more of a hardcore (okay, not really, but more active) raider prior to this big thesis that kinda takes up majority of my life now. I would still like to do normal or heroic raiding content but juts don't have all the time in the world anymore :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wait, what? 125 instead of 25 Work Orders for the lvl 3 Barn?<br />
<br />
That means instead of 5 days to get up and running for Savage Bloods and feasts it will take 21-22 days on a single character. This pretty much forces raiders to level multiple alts to get barn work orders going just to get even a chance on an epic upgrade before raiding. Never mind getting enough feasts.<br />
<br />
Did they add another source of Bloods are are they deliberately making crafting as useless as possible?</div></div><hr />

LFR only different looking sets :P heroic sets look better and mythic sets even better than that. <br />
Also lfr setbonuses are different. So the stats and looks are different from the real tier sets.<br />

<br />
The 2-piece is only a 100 or 125 point boost to one stat. How valuable is that compared to the extra stats you would get from higher level pieces in those slots? (That's a real question, I don't have the loot in front of me.) Remember that normal+ raids and drops from challenge mode come out weeks before LFR-- the high-end guilds will have been on mythic for a while when LFR's first wing releases, so unless someone has abysmal loot luck the LFR generic tier will be a downgrade compared to the real tier set bonuses.<br />
<br />
Come to think of it, do these demi-tier sets also drop from CM chests, or are those their own thing? If so, the real hardcore raiders will likely have them before LFR ever opens.</div></div><hr />
