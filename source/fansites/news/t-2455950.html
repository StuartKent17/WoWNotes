Lets make flying mounts, sell them and then not allow people to fly for &quot;reasons&quot; . Fuck blizzard right now.<br />
<br />
Yeah honestly. Flying in this game should be like how FF14 does it imo.<br />
<br />
15 &quot;aether currents&quot; aka little green gas blobs. 10 are scattered around the zone and 5 are from sidequests with 1 of the 5 usually from a story one. Once you have all 15 you can fly in that specific zone.<br />
<br />
The way FF14 does it is just so perfect. It's not timegated but each zone needs flying unlocked for it and it's quite easy.</div></div><hr />

Mythic Jaina has one.<br />

Emerald Nightmare and Highmaul never had a Mythic mount either.<br />

Mogushan had Astral Serpent but Elegon wasn't the end boss of that raid. Heart of Fear and Terrace didn't have a heroic mount either.<br />

It's a common thing for the first tier these days to not have a Mythic only mount. G'huuns prestige could be considered the top 100 feat.</div></div><hr />

Meh. I guess the last one was Cata? If we are going solely by entry raids.<br />
<br />
Al'Akir had the Wind Drake and that was considered tier since it dropped set pieces. Although that tier was done oddly and split over 3 raids.<br />

Eh I'm gonna say it counts. I mean it dropped on both difficulties though but eh.</div></div><hr />

This is basically the whiny, salty part of the community of WoW. They’ll focus on the smallest things that don’t matter, especially when it comes to in-game mounts (for example). Realistically, if they were in-game the people who get salty the most over them would probably be too lazy to earn them anyway.</div></div><hr />

Yep, so does Mekkatorque, as did a few of of the BFA dungeon end bosses, and there are a ton of mounts from world mobs and rares. <br />

BFA brought in a hell of a lot of mounts.<br />
<br />
I think the only weak addition really was the Alliance rep ones. It's still stupid they are all horses.<br />
<br />
I mean Horde gets a Hyena, Bloodswarmer thingy and a Pterrodax.<br />
<br />
I think Mekkatorques is across all difficulties though. Showed up in the LFR difficulty section. So I guess it's like the Abyss Worm in Tomb of Sargeras. Which is nice.</div></div><hr />

Why would they be here?

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dunkl</div><div class="date">2018-12-13, 07:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was thinking when we discover the home-place of the Vulpera, it would be a thick forest or heavily wooded realm with tall trees, burrows and have a very peaceful, naturey atmosphere. I am looking forward to exploring where the original ancestors of the current Vulpera we meet in Vol'dun, live. I thought that Vol'dun remnants of the original Vulpera would be reunited with their kin someday - and we'd not only go there ourselves but we'd witness their ancestors welcome them home. Ffter traveling and being gone for so long, the current Vulpera cannot remember where they are from (except for a few old spoken stories in their current culture). I am hoping we will get to see this play out, and be part of their reuniting. <br />
<br />
The current generation of Vulpera don't really remember where they are from originally. I also thought of unmet races inhabiting near / around where they were from. There would be a Celtic-themed, white stag race, draped in deep green robes with ornate golden trim, adorning their antlers with bits and baubles dangling from shimmering string, who lives in the snowy woods. A neighboring clan of dwarves - woodland cousins to the main three clans and similar or even connected to the wildhammers in their druidic ways. Rustic and earthy in their ways and living in clover-topped homes. I would love to write some of these races and stories! <br />
<br />
Now I'm wondering if the Vulpera are from somewhere else altogether, with the fox showing up, seeking out Azeroth children / champions for companionship. Maybe it's a creature that lives or lived where the Vulpera are originally from. Just fun thoughts!</div></div><hr />

Like Mounts that move the same speed as every other mount you own and is capable of flying in areas that you can fly in with other flying mounts you already own. wait. <br />
<br />

<br />

Good question, although if you must have some kinda answer... It's an interdimensional space fox that is probably the Vulpera version of a sphinx. kinda crappy in that it's all the same animal, but eh.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah honestly. Flying in this game should be like how FF14 does it imo.<br />

The way FF14 does it is just so perfect. It's not timegated but each zone needs flying unlocked for it and it's quite easy.<br />
<br />
While I do agree that the FF14 model is great, it's worth noting that all the zones in 14 are on different Maps so it's easier to do it that way. They could still do it that way in WoW, but you would probably have to tie it into the achievement system and unlock it once you get all the relevant achievements for that region.<br />

Magic Rooster is a REAL WoW mount.<br />

Can't believe there are people spending real money for... mounts.<br />
<br />
or real money for anything in-game, but it happens.</div></div><hr />

Good question, although if you must have some kinda answer... It's an interdimensional space fox that is probably the Vulpera version of a sphinx. kinda crappy in that it's all the same animal, but eh.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
While I do agree that the FF14 model is great, it's worth noting that all the zones in 14 are on different Maps so it's easier to do it that way. They could still do it that way in WoW, but you would probably have to tie it into the achievement system and unlock it once you get all the relevant achievements for that region.<br />

Arathi and Darkshore say hi. You will eventually be able to fly in content. Seriously the haters are really are putting no effort into it anymore. Its not like this is new.

If it never goes down well then there is no reason to hold back on releasing it now. I still haven't said anything about releasing all in one batch. What I am saying is that there is no reason to hold off on something if as you claim it never goes down well anyways. It's release is meaningless by your argument. I understand perfectly fine what you are trying to claim. It just doesn't work the way you think it does because of the meaning of words.</div></div><hr />

Next raid does have a mythic boss drop, and the art team doesn't really have anything to do with the rest of that. like it was mentioned earlier, there's only 13 store mounts and over 400 in game ones, they're doing just fine</div></div><hr />

The fox mount itself is cool and all... but those wings. Those wings ruin the mount, for me. They clearly look like they do not belong in the model. Like adding a duck bill to a toaster. If they're going to make the mount look like a land animal... then they should make it a land mount. Otherwise, base it on something else that flies naturally.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well of course if you exclude parts of current content it will fit the narrative you want. It doesn't matter if you can fly or not currently. The mount works perfectly fine on the ground and can fly in flying enabled content. Why would you prefer a ground only mount that becomes useless once flying is enabled? Seriously.

Uhhhhh?I see a ton of people in game using the mount. People gladly will pay to get it because they are collectors and don't want to have to grind for it knowing it will be a ridiculously low drop chance to get it if they do put it in game. <br />
<br />
And again youtube dislikes does in no way = huge backlash against it.<br />

Blizzard: hold my beer!<br />
<br />
How does anything gets worse by additional mount, in shop or otherwise? And by things, and worse, I assume you mean game itself, right? Because as far as I know, mounts don't really impact the game itself. The only thing that gets worse with this, is players complaining. But since that is already over the top since BfA release, I hardly see a difference, right now people will complain no matter what. Even if Blizzard suddenly decided to give everyone free year of gametime, people would find a way to be unhappy about it, demanding 2 years or whatever...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seconded. Things have gotten to the point where almost every thread is pissing and moaning about something. Like you said even a free year of game time would be complained about. I’m not saying complaining is wrong but a lot of these should be directed towards the wow forums so actual devs see them. Posting complaints here literally does nothing .<br />

<br />
The positive thing about internet is allowing everyone to share their opinion.<br />
Thats also the negative thing with it.<br />
<br />
Whiners are more likely to spread their negativity because they have nothing else interesting going on in their lives where as the posivite people focus on more important stuff and dont spend time on pointless things like crying on some niche-forum.<br />
<br />
Hence there will often be a majority of whiners/dislikers because they simply have no life and that makes them go around hating on everything they can find.<br />
<br />
<br />

its not Ions fault so many people are to busy whining on forums instead using crafting proffs or milion other ways to collect 500k (or however much is tokens nowadays) needed to buy 2 tokens to buy this mount with in game gold.<br />
<br />
since battle net balance you people have no right to tell that you cannot acces those goodies from inside the game too - thats how i bought all mounts , pets , helms . overwatch ,diablo necromancer and starcraft remastered etc - without spending a single $$$.</div></div><hr />

Uhm...Why is this Vulpera, that costs 200,000g/350,000g (US/EU) somehow worse than the new 333,333g frogs that you get from vendor? Or the 650,000 Army of the Light warframe? Or longboi, for that matter? Just curious. Would it be better if it was raid drop, and you needed to farm it for 2 years (spending MUCH more money on subs during that time).<br />
<br />
Honestly, for me it's just more complaining for the sake of complaining. Want it? Buy it. With money if you want, with gold if you don't. Don't want it? What's the fucking problem then? The fact that Blizzard will earn some more money? Tragedy. And as for your &quot;bad timing&quot; argument, it's always a bad time. Ever since they introduced the first cash shop mount, people were complaining, talking about how we're heading to p2w and shit...And somehow, 8 years later, we still haven't arrived there. Almost like with this &quot;dead game&quot; meme...</div></div><hr />

Ever since WoW tokens these in-game shop mounts are no different than mounts bought for gold. It's just the matter if you earn real money or in game gold faster to decide what you find more suitable for you.<br />

You can spend your money how you want, and i can spend my money to help fuel a nazi regime . <br />

The point is.if YOU BY THIS MOUNT you are sending the message to activation that you support microtransactions in a 60$ box price game, ON TOP of your subscription. <br />
<br />
Long ago this would have been a reward for CONTENT and now its a reward for your real world cash. <br />

/edit<br />
Also, the worst moment to introduce new mount to the store. Some things are not comming in the 8.1 and ppl arent happy about that. They fixed some issues but the core game systems in the bfa are the same garbage it was before. Warfronts are still warfronts, islands are still more of a mindless hack&amp;slash game than rpg game (for me the issue is also that its just a garbage farm that is literally detached from the rest of the game world and instead of being something u do while waiting for a raid or a group to form u are queueing to form a group for that thing) professions being still boring, the fuss about bad communication about ptr thing, not the best times. <br />
<br />
Besides if u were one of those ppl who said: &quot;nahh, ill take a break from wow till the new raid will be out and play new fallout instead&quot;, well lets just say ppl are more and more pissed about AAA developers and publishers and start to boycott some tittles (exept few shining examples like cd project red).

Thanks to Warlords i made over 10 million gold and legion was just as bad so i have so much gold i could play this game for free for the next 6 years!<br />
<br />
TBH at the end of the day does it really matter? Most people who buy these mounts just use them once gets the high from buying it and never uses it again and besides its not like this mount is gonna cost a raid tier HAHA.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't necessarily get that big a head about &quot;sticking it to Blizzard by buying Tokens!&quot; because each of those tokens that you buy is giving Blizzard an extra free $5 that they don't have to do anything to get. Every person currently playing the game has still provided the same, or more money, than if you weren't playing at all. It just so happens that Token buyers are giving directly to Blizzard, but via someone else spending more to Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

WTF dude? Free to play games have it of course, so they can make some money out of it. But you pay a monthly fee here. They just released one of the weakest content patches, and then they come out with this? This could be in the Vulpera paragon cache for example.

now thing is they have to pay taxes, these are games devs, you also have to remember they have a MASSIVE campus, and well need to pay for alot, all the masive things of a buisness, their caffeteria that is free, their water, insurance, server costs, electricity, property, lawers, marketing, outsource developers, the massive internet bills.<br />
and many many, MANY more.<br />

In a sub-based game, it does.

It is an accurate comparison. What is delusional is the pathetic attempts to discount it because it owns your argument you can't admit your argument was bad.<br />

It used to. Prior to Wrath, Blizzard had been quoted as saying they were against micro transactions for WoW since it was already a sub based game. They just changed their stance which is the definition of hypocrisy considering WoW didn't go free to play. It's still sub based, but now they just charge for extra stuff that could have been available in game which we already pay a subscription for.</div></div><hr />

Fair enough, they're not hypocrites, but the company itself is still held accountable to its player base for flip flopping. So the current developers aren't hypocrites, just greedy and don't give a shit what their SUB BASED player base thinks.</div></div><hr />

The ship has long since sailed on that though. The original CE and TCG were selling in-game goods at the start. The TCG was artificially propped up by those loot rewards as well. It is hardly greedy to sell a few mounts, pets, and helms every once in a while. Now if they were selling it all the time. Heck some of these &quot;greedy&quot; pets and mounts are raising money for charity.</div></div><hr />

Nope.... its literally in every game. You have a x-box or playstation? I mean you pay $60+ bucks for a game, and unless you pay their monthly fee you don't get access to the online parts of the game (which is most of it), want all those unique suits, guns, mounts, titles that people have in the games... Its all in their stores. It's literally in every game system out there that is connected in anyway to the internet. Its all about making money, those that have it never have enough and want more, and they know people are willing to pay for it. Would I love it if that mount was in the Vulpera paragon cache, HELL YEAH!!! Apparently though players didn't like that the paragon caches had mounts so they got rid of that option.</div></div><hr />
