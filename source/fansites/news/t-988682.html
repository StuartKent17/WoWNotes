In the event that a guild leader takes a leave of absence and remains inactive for an extended period of time, it can be difficult for some guilds to carry on as normal. To help assist with these situations, we're introducing a new system in patch 4.3 known as &quot;inactive guild leader replacement&quot; that will allow players of the appropriate rank to take over leadership of a guild from an inactive guild leader via the Guild tab.

In the event that a guild leader takes a leave of absence and remains inactive for an extended period of time, it can be difficult for some guilds to carry on as normal. To help assist with these situations, we're introducing a new system in patch 4.3 known as &quot;inactive guild leader replacement&quot; that will allow players of the appropriate rank to take over leadership of a guild from an inactive guild leader via the Guild tab.<br />
<br />
The way inactive guild leader replacement works is pretty straightforward. If a guild leaderâ€™s character is inactive for 30 days, a notification will appear in the Guild News &amp; Events feed which can only be seen by guild members who are eligible to become the new guild leader. To determine eligibility, the game will look for the highest ranked character in the guild that's logged on in the past week, and any guild member from that rank will be able to request guild leadership simply by clicking on the notification.<br />
<br />
As with many actions in World of Warcraft, clicking on the notification will open up a confirmation window which, once accepted, will transition leadership from the inactive guild leader to the first player to request leadership. If guild leadership is changed, the old guild leader will be notified via email to his or her registered Battle.net address. While some players may need to log out and back in before their Guild tab will visually update, the change in leadership will be immediate, with all ranks and permissions remaining in-tact.<br />
<br />
Please note that if you're an active leader of a guild, this system should not affect you or your guild. The goal of inactive guild leader replacement is simply to allow guilds which have found themselves without leadership for a long period of time to resolve the situation on their own without the need to contact our In-Game Support department.<br />
<br />
Inactive guild leader replacement is currently live on the PTR, but keep in mind that it may be difficult to test, as a guild leader will need to be inactive for a full 30 days before the option to transition leadership will become available.</div></div><hr />

Well, it has always been 30 days. The difference between now and the new system is that currently, you put in a ticket in order to get leadership after the guild leader hasn't logged on it at least 30 days.</div></div><hr />

We just had to request leadership from the old inactive guild master in my current guild. He hasn't been around since cata and we still went 13/13 pre 4.2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's all relative. It's really not that short, but for a Guild Master leaving having control of all aspects of the guild, it's a LONG time for thoese in the guild. You used to be able to petition it to you, but the problem with that was that anyone of any rank could do that.<br />
<br />
Just log in once in the 30 day period to keep it rolling if you're concerned.</div></div><hr />

There's nothing to abuse, 30 days might not be long.., but hopefully officer n' alike talks a potential g-transfer over, n' if the reason is valid once / if an old leader returns, it's easy to transfer back.<br />
Either your there for the guild or your not, don't really see any grey zone..</div></div><hr />

The same system is already in place now, if an guild master has been inactive for 30 days you can write a ticket to transfer leadership to someone else in the guild</div></div><hr />

I don't get why a guild master of a guild level 25 guild would think it's okay to leave for 30 days + And have everything in tact, when it's still a communal guild for the rest of the people in it. Unless purchased as such, it's not a single person's guild only, the guild mater sure as hell didn't get to 25 himself, and if he chooses to take a 3 month break, there is no reason why they should have their arms tied behind their back as the guild master has his leave, while still they contribute money to the guild bank (At which point the GM can come back and collect and make bank off of that). Once again too, it's not the only way to do this, this is already in game VIA Tickets, this is just an interface option,</div></div><hr />

Is typing full words really that hard? And the rule is not new, so nothing will change. It's just to make it easier and lessen the requests to the Gamemasters. It's a good change.</div></div><hr />

I also don't like the idea that it seems to be a &quot;first come, first served&quot; style system instead of a vote, even if the vote was just among the officers - maybe I'm not reading it right, but it doesn't seem to suggest that people will be able to shut down a bid for GM. This coupled with the &quot;it's going to be difficult to test&quot; does worry me.</div></div><hr />

Sure, if you level 25 guild is some shitty leveling farm, then yea, you might have to kick everyone or pay a 15$/month maintenance fee on what is ostensibly your most valuable in-game possession.</div></div><hr />

its only purpose is to save people having to open a ticket to request the transfer of leadership. - save GM's time so they can deal with some noob hunter saying his wolf doesnt have stealth like the other night elf lvl 30 hunter in gnomer that has it for his cat<br />
<br />
I think having to open a ticket and having a gm investigate is more thorough buuuut i guess if one noob complains about it on forums then others will therefore a new lazy 'click to get gm' system will be implemented, blizzard really needs better solutions... for example: <br />
<br />
what if a gm is on holidays for 30 days and leaves leading the guild to his 2nd in command? he'd have to, to make sure no one else takes gm status <br />
Will the gm have to pass leadership to this 2nd in command to ensure the guild isnt passed off onto someone that has their own agenda - since they only have to click a button now.. or better yet after the rank 1 gives gm to his 2ic, what if the 2ic takes the guild for himself? <br />

this. GM position requires you to be active. if youre not active, pass it to someone trustworthy and capable for the time being. you can get it back when you come back.<br />
<br />
For all the &quot;pseudo guilds&quot;, this change doesnt matter anyway. kick everyone out like you all shouldve been doing if you quit sub for while. like many pointed out, theres already a petition system that does the same thing right now. so it doesnt change anything, it just makes things easier to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or if he has legitimate reasons like some really long vacation or a long business trip he can always just tell that to his officers. ItÂ´s not like he gets autokicked after 30 days of inactivity. If the officers know whats going on no one will remove him as a guild leader.</div></div><hr />

There isn't really an investigation when ticketing to take a guild over from an inactive leader other than, 1) has the guild leader not been logged in for at least 30 days and 2) is the person ticketing for leadership in the guild? This new system has more control than the tickets as it will at least filter people based on eligibility of their rank where as now whoever tickets first (no matter the rank) can get the leadership.</div></div><hr />

<br />
same way people have found ways in abusing all these silly systems. dont tell me you've never been ripped off or had someone exploit something that you've spent a while trying to earn - maybe you havnt been playing long enough ;) <br />
<br />
<br />
Shouldn't even be an option.The guild leader owns it,just cause they want to study for uni or concentrate on a work project for 3 months,they should not lose their property.The officers should have access to all the tabs anyway if they wish to clean it out and start another guild.Even though they feel robbed of their guild achievements/history...to fkn bad,it belongs to the guild leader plain and simple.For instance if you own a house and decide to go on holiday why should your flatmates/tenants be able to claim the house.<br />
<br />
well unfortunately in the world we live in, in most countries there are squatter laws that protect them when they decide to move into your house after you leave it unattended for too long etc etc but yeah morale is.. well idk it just sucks :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well if the Guild Leader is needing to do RL things, then he/she should hand over the reigns temporarily until he/she returns, this is not about that, this is about people who just vanish and either never return or come back 6mths-year later, meanwhile the guild has disbanded as they dont know what is going on. You can't compare it to your suggestion of you going on holiday and someone claiming your house. Two totally different situations and at the end of the day YOU don't own your guild, Blizzard does.</div></div><hr />

In my opinion a good guild leader should make someone else temporary GL if they're gone for longer than 2 weeks, so that that person can handle things like the guildbank and whatever is needed.<br />
30 days absence (specially when unexplained) is actually kinda long for an active guild, at least, that's what my experience is as an officer. It's just not handy to not have the GL options available to someone in the guild for a longer duration.</div></div><hr />

Really, give me a single example. The fact is that this is already in-game, you just need to contact a GM to do it, so nothing changes except for the fact that it becomes an interface option instead of you contacting a GM for it. I would actually argue that this system is better, because at the moment GM:s may necessarily not even look at your rank when passing the leadership on, there have been stories about GM:s changing the leadership of a raiding guild to some new trialist just because he was the first to make a ticket about it, this system at least checks the rank of the people making the change. Furthermore, if you are the guild master of a guild where you don't trust your officers enough to handle the guild in your absence then perhaps you should either find new officers or stop being a guild master. The only people against this change are people that are suddenly worried that that level 25 leveling guild they're using to farm cash from with the Cash Flow perk might actually force you to log online once every month. Also, lol at the RL examples, news flash, a guild in wow is in no way comparable to an apartment in real life, you don't have hundreds of people using your apartment daily in real life like bigger guilds do in WoW, furthermore, nothing forces you to lead a guild in wow, however you are more or less forced to have an apartment in real life, the whole comparison is absolutely ridiculous. Even if you have to study or work for 3 months then you either find that 5 minutes per month to log on once, or you pass the leadership to those who care about the guild enough to do so.</div></div><hr />

It is based on how many consecutive days the character who is guild master has been logged off for. And also, from the vacations that you have already taken from the game, if they have been 30+ days of being logged out (and you are a guild master) you did run the risk of having someone put in a ticket to get the guild leadership transferred to them.</div></div><hr />

Ofc a guildleader can take a longer break, the guildleader just needs to pass the leadership to someone highranking so that the guild can keep functioning. Like in the real world, a wellfunctioning company doesnt remain wellfunctioning without a leader for a longer period of time.

so if the leader goes on holidays for 30+ days, his job is passed off onto the next guy no questions asked? have you ever had a job? <br />
the boss wont get demoted for his actions - he would come back after a month right back to his boss position.<br />
but with this, he'll come back after a wonderful holiday to dubai only to have to sell his house the week after, his wife leaves him for a richer man, his kids start hating him cause he cant buy them the new BF3 since he got fired. <br />

Well if he goes on holidays for 30+ days without arranging it with the company then someone else may get his job, yes, as he would basically be quitting under job abandonment. But on the other hand if he arranged it with the company then they would probably get someone else to cover portions of his job (read: guild officers) until he came back.</div></div><hr />

If a guild leader wants to take an extended break then they need to transfer leadership to someone else. A guild leader doesn't OWN the guild. And if they think they do, I hope all the smart players have left it already.<br />
<br />
If you are a boss leading a company you don't suddenly go &quot;I'm taking 6 months off. See you when I get back! No one can take my place in that time!&quot;</div></div><hr />

your missing the point man<br />
<br />
with this new system you cant say to blizzard &quot;hey im gona afk for 30 days, plz dont kick me&quot;, its all automated and it doesnt matter if you tell everyone or not that your going away for a month - your guild can get taken away from you regardless... there is no arrangements! unless you pass gm to an officer but again! you can be shafted</div></div><hr />

Or, knowing that you'll be gone for an extended amount of time, you hand over leadership of the guild to someone you trust to some extent before leaving.<br />

No. It's more like the boss and husband disappearing without prior arrangements for 30 days at a time, then coming back and expecting everything to be the same as when he left when he comes back. <br />
<br />
The guild is more than just the guild master, unless it's a Bank Alt Guild. If it's a functioning guild, you can't expect to leave and come back when you like, because it leaves all the other people who are carrying the guild on their back hanging. Chances are if you're above guild level 5, you didn't get there on your own.</div></div><hr />

No, it's always been the way it is now and will be in 4.3: if the GM is gone 30+ days, you can arrange a change in leadership. The only change is that instead of ticketing to make it happen, you use an in-game interface.</div></div><hr />

First of all, this is something people clearly care about, and is clearly an issue.<br />

Secondly this is a DIFFERENT team than most other functions in game. This team deals with Guilds, Groups, raids, and the programing behind their functions and what not. This is also a smaller project for about 1 or 2 people.</div></div><hr />

1) If someone is injured bad enough that they have to spend 30 days in the hospital, their WoW guild is probably the last thing they should be worrying about<br />
<br />
2) No offense against our soldiers, but if you are on active duty oversees with foreseeable periods of time away from the game, you probably should not be the GM of a guild.</div></div><hr />

Multiple issues with this. My girlfriend raids with me. She's one of my two highest ranked officers. The other one, I may have met via WoW, but over the past years, we've invited him over several times and know him just as well as any other person we consider a close friend.<br />

Of course you can't trust a person you have never met. That's why you don't. Make sure you have a decent person in your guild to take over when you can't log in even for a minute over 30 days.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">darkwarrior42</div><div class="date">2011-09-30, 09:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As others have noted this &quot;30 days of inactivity and I can take over the guild&quot; policy has been going on for awhile. It has led to some pretty uphappy campers who didn't know the policy and returns to find they are no longer GM of the guild. I actually like this feature as it brings that policy to the foreground and out in the open so GM's can take appropriate steps of either promoting someone or kicking everyone out rather then some shady behind the scene maneuvering. My problem is the policy itself as I can see people gone from 30 days that is beyond their control. For instance getting into an accident and having to go to the hospital. Or I know a lot of army guys play over in Iraq and I can think of a few scenarios why they may not log in. Also, there is no option for the GM to get his guild back unless the new GM is nice and hands it back. While I do feel sorry for those who have the leader quit on them it's not like they don't have the option of quitting and starting their own guild.<br />
<br />
1) Why should they have to quit the guild just because the GM is absent for a while? If it's someone high enough rank to be eligible under the new system, odds are (s)he has contributed quite a bit. Take my present guild: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/guild/thrall/Necrology/roster?view=guildActivity&amp;sort=lifetime&amp;dir=a that is a list of contribution of guild xp, sorted by highest lifetime contribution. Dajakisubo and Zulandir are both my characters, and Lumindae belongs to my wife. Together we hold the top 3 spots. Our GM holds virtually all power as far as guild permissions. He is GM, his girlfriend is rank 1, rank 2 is reserved for their alts, rank 3 is the highest rank outside of the two of them. My paladin is rank 3, and all I can do as far as guild permissions go is access one additional bank tab and invite new guild members (I cannot promote, just invite). I have no problem with any of this, and it works well... so long as our guild master is here. If he went AWOL for some reason, we couldn't do much to maintain the guild. Why should my wife and I have to start a new guild to keep guild functionality going? (I use my guild because I know and trust my GM, and he wouldn't go awol that long without letting someone know). <br />
<br />
2) Yes, now everyone will know about it. That's good and bad. A lot of people who were upset were former GMs who didn't know about the policy, and were usurped by those who did. Now they know about it, and can actively protect themselves against it, if they feel it might be a problem.</div></div><hr />

You missunderstood what they meant. They have probably already thoroughly tested it internally. What they meant was that it will be hard for players to test on the PTR because of the 30 day requirement.<br />
<br />
I think people who are complaining about this are being overdramatic. If someone leaves the game for 30+ days (willingly or not), the guild and the game have obviously lost its importance in that persons life.</div></div><hr />

EXACTLY this. Kind of unfair, considering time zones, work schedules, and whatnot. Just because someone's first to log in while the GM's time expires doesn't mean he's fit for the job. They could take the GM position when nobody was really paying attention, boot everyone out, and keep the guild to themselves. Granted, hopefully Blizzard wouldn't let that slide, but this IS Blizzard we're talking about...<br />
<br />
If there are several officers, it should be an elected official to take the GM position. One more layer of defense, I guess. Otherwise, they'll end up with a GM they don't necessarily want, and the guild would fall apart from everyone abandoning ship.</div></div><hr />

However with this, I'm thinking of just hanging my wow-reigns and moving on to my next hobby. This is IMO the worst system implemented in this game to date, and that's including the terrible RBG system.I regularly go on 1-2 month excursions about once every year or so, and with this new system - I come back home and suddenly my ~80,000g guild is stolen from me under sanction of blizzard, all because I invited 1 guys alt and kept him on the bottom rank, so he could get 20% more xp/rep/honor, and buy his dark phoenix / lv25 guild mount. I'd feel bad for booting him now, but essentially my choices are : boot him or get my guild stolen from me. God forbid I actually have a small-medium sized social guild, and have a real life of my own that involves any form of international travel.I hate this system. I truly do.

If a guild leader is inactive for more than 30 days, it's time to pass leadership. So please explain how this could possible be &quot;abused&quot;?<br />
<br />
The way it can get abused is the first &quot;officer&quot; to request Leadership gets GM no questions asked and there is nothing the guild can do about it. basiclly it creates a dictatorship. The Gm takes a break I think I can do better so I beat everyone else to it and now the guild is mine. There needs to be a vote option from the other officers before it gets aporved.</div></div><hr />

We knew the guy IRL, and he just couldn't play. Two months passed, and due to our leader not being around, a -lot- of things we were trying to get done couldn't be because of permissions (typically rules implemented by the officers and the like or just general administrative stuff to keep things organized). Really, I take a good month or so off of WoW yearly as well, twice yearly even. If I had a guild leader position, I would sure as hell just give it to an officer I trusted that I know would be active. If you are so paranoid people will usurp your power, why did you make them officers in the first place? As most people said, if you have to go for a month, just make sure you have an officer you trust or a friend take over.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">The Last DJ</div><div class="date">2011-09-30, 11:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This will only be abused by guilds with complete and utter idiots at the helm. If you know you're going to be away for 30+ days, you promote your highest ranked, most trusted officer. If you couldn't trust him with your guild bank or guild responsibilities, they don't deserve even the faintest whiff of leadership. Or, better yet, you could communicate this sort of shit with your guild. &quot;Hey guys, I'm going to be AFK for a bit because I'm moving/have other responsibilities/just taking a break from WoW, if the guild leader inactivity option comes up, it defaults to so-and-so but I want you guys to still behave as if I were the guild leader - IE so-and-so will be leader in title alone, but the guild will still do things as normal. Loot councils, democratic voting in of members, so on and so forth.&quot; It's amazing what happens when you act like responsible, mature adults without the passive-aggressive bullshit. If you're going to cock off for 30+ days without a word, and you're running a really real guild, not one of those one-off guilds with seven people who log on infrequently, the more active, responsible members of the guild should be able to continue to function as a guild without having to roundabout things like bank permissions and so forth. Any guild over level 3 can't be disbanded anyway, even by the guild leader. <br />
decent idea, I like it, but I think the name is a bit long... I much prefer 'Incite coup d'etat' ;) Bahahaha! I think I'm going to institute a rule that if a coup is ever staged, it has to be a reenactment of &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This.<br />
<br />
If he's taking an extended break, and owns a leveling guild with randos, kick everyone out, nbd.<br />
<br />
If he's taking an extended break, and owns a progression or even casual raiding guild, he has to pass on lead. Which he should, a raiding guild without an active GM is not fair for the other 9-30 members.<br />
<br />
All this prevents it someone from starting a leveling guild, never logging on, logging back 3 months later to collect profit. You can't do that anymore, too bad.<br />
<br />
I whole-heartedly support this. All the good guilds I've been in (including my main's current), when the GM decides to take a break, he passed lead to the top officer. If he comes back, he may become leader again, and he may not. That's for the two of them to discuss.<br />

To be fair, if you're no longer paying them, why do they care if they give your stuff to someone else?<br />
<br />
They're helping paying customers (people still in the guild) at the expense of some dude who isn't their customer anymore (GM with a lapsed subscription). Yup... seems not only logical, but fair.<br />
<br />
Edit: Communist? REALLY? You're either trolling (possible), or don't know what the word communism means (probable). It's literally as far from communism as possible. If anything, the guild system is a dictatorship. Just like in a real dictatorship, if the dictator disappears (i.e., not being online for 30 days), the next in power takes overs. The dictator wasn't actually dead? Whoops, now the new guys controls the army. GG.</div></div><hr />

Besides the system is flawed at the core. The internal ranks don't display guild intern ranking. You can setup intern 1. Gm 2. Member 3. Officer and now you have Members as second highest rank for nomination. And those names aren't always so easy to tell apart.

Stop being selfish and thinking about yourself. If it's a serious raiding guild, there are at least 20 other people in that guild. Waiting a month is long enough without an active leader. You don't want to lose leadership. Log in. Even for a second. Don't go inactive for 30 days. :/</div></div><hr />

Because shit for brains a house is your property, but a guild is a club and the gm is the club president. The president may have started the group and organized it for a few years, but the club members got the gold did the raids got the achievements not solely the gm so stfu asswipe.<br />

Highest ranking means highest ranking, the arbitrary name you give your ranks wouldn't come into consideration.<br />

But just like some guilds has some random guild leaders take out of nowhere permanent hiatus, I am sure another amount of people also may be gone or away from WoW playing for a month or months every year for other cyclical obligations. I known a couple people with jobs who work a month or a few months a year but make 6 digits because they engineer/manage big projects dedicating all those days strictly to the projects, as well as college students that may need to take a month off per say for school, WoW's addictive properties is, you must not start playing even for a little bit if you don't want to get stuck spending mis-used hours into the game. I think if a guild is worth keeping, having and can go on for months alone w/o a guild leader then it may need to be like 2 months. If you don't feel like giving items to a guild because a GL might leave then don't I don't see how non-owners should really take over they never built up or started. I would see it being okay if say the account holder of the guild we also non-subscriber, but 30 days just seems short, most guilds can function for many weeks without the need of the GL to be present, we all know it, its Blizzard fault for introducing this crappy guild leveling system in the first place, that causes so many issues now, because everybody wants their perks and prizes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Infracted.<br />
<br />
By joining a guild, not leading it, you already got what you joined for, if you don't like the fact the GL is gone then leave. Club President does not equal a guild leader, you don't have meetings and &quot;official&quot; business to do, scheduling anything is simple in game, and you can raid and function without consent to do things like a President position would.<br />
<br />
Often is why you implement a VP as well, VPs take over in absence but they are never the President unless they are gone for good.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think its right to make it convenient to snatch a guild up, from somebody who put a crapload of work into starting something they can show ass theirs and feel proud of, but hell they ever need to take a brake its gone. I don't agree with what has existed, so stop pointing it out nor do I support the change, not for my sake at all but for others.</div></div><hr />

Second, I think that otherwise the takeover of leadership should require that the players of the highest rank(s) vote on their new leader, as with a simple &quot;click to get Gild Bankz&quot; any old butthole who simply had their rank to carry out their duties could claim the guild and steal everything.</div></div><hr />

Not ever guild is the same or formed the same.<br />
<br />
I think it should be up to the guild's creators to design its course, not the Devs to structure it to be the same for everybody. Yes multi/group guild leader systems would be fun and appropriate but that is for guilds who are founded in a commune fashion or by a group of people not just one, wanting equal &quot;power&quot; or status. People should be entitled to have their guilds the way they want, whether its group run or individually run.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure there are guilds out there who have equally high ranked officers but are on each other's throats if it wasn't for the guild leader stepping in between them. Or in one of my previous guilds, we had an officer that was as closely trusted as any of our other officers, and thus had no reason for any suspicion. But then, he suddenly had a server transfer without letting us know. The only way our guild leader realized it is because all the guild bank rares have been ninja'd. I can imagine how some officer could just &quot;steal&quot; a guild because he has that &quot;I'm not gonna see any of you aholes anymore&quot; mentality.</div></div><hr />

You don't own anything in this game, you do realize that right? I hope so. I hope you don't think just because you formed a guild that you own everyone in it and that they have to abide by your every command or something ridiculous like that. If you are going to C O M M I T yourself to building a GUILD and then plan to abandon it/them because you want to take a break or you're tired of playing, then don't have the nerve to say it isn't fair that someone else gets to take control. Nothing in this entire world runs that way, and to think otherwise is absurd. And again with the entitlement..you as a player are not entitled to anything except being able to log on. There is no argument. Guild leaders can design their guild's course. What guild leaders (and most do) need to realize that when you are a leader you have made a commitment to other people. If you aren't willing to commit then don't build a guild, it's that simple.By the way, before anyone argues more over this...This feature is nothing new. All they are doing is implementing a system that does the leadership exchange for them, so that they don't have to manually do it.</div></div><hr />

you clearly need to read the blue post again...<br />
if you read the post while awake, with your face out of your WoW game, you can see that they say:<br />
&quot;To determine eligibility, the game will look for the highest ranked character in the guild that's logged on in the past week, and any guild member from that rank will be able to request guild leadership simply by clicking on the notification.&quot;</div></div><hr />

That guilds remain active and populated.<br />
<br />
The actual result?<br />
<br />
Everyone in a level 25 guild gets gkicked because the GM wants to keep the name and is too worried about losing it.<br />
<br />
Blizzard basically enacts a policy that gives every GM out there an incentive to mass kick everyone from their guild if there's even a slight chance they think they might be gone a little too long. Suddenly on every server there's entire waves of people that now have to start the Guild rep grind all over again.<br />

If you are gone 30 days, and the people you play with know why, and respect you, you are fine. If you aren't able to return, or just have no intention of doing so, the reigns are handed to someone else. I don't see the issue here. If a GM kicks everyone out because he's going to be offline a while, then he's a crappy GM to start with, and you are probably going to want to find a new guild.</div></div><hr />

Anyone who thinks they own a guild needs a reality check. Get off your high horse, if you leave for over a month and still expect to be big cheese you would be wrong.

<br />
its only purpose is to save people having to open a ticket to request the transfer of leadership. - save GM's time so they can deal with some noob hunter saying his wolf doesnt have stealth like the other night elf lvl 30 hunter in gnomer that has it for his cat<br />
<br />
I think having to open a ticket and having a gm investigate is more thorough buuuut i guess if one noob complains about it on forums then others will therefore a new lazy 'click to get gm' system will be implemented, blizzard really needs better solutions... for example: <br />
<br />
what if a gm is on holidays for 30 days and leaves leading the guild to his 2nd in command? he'd have to, to make sure no one else takes gm status <br />
Will the gm have to pass leadership to this 2nd in command to ensure the guild isnt passed off onto someone that has their own agenda - since they only have to click a button now.. or better yet after the rank 1 gives gm to his 2ic, what if the 2ic takes the guild for himself? <br />
<br />
Well there you go in the 20 seconds i had to think of that at 4am i've already thought of why this is stupid. <br />
<br />
and my finally my favourite part - &quot;Inactive guild leader replacement is currently live on the PTR, but keep in mind that it may be difficult to test, as a guild leader will need to be inactive for a full 30 days before the option to transition leadership will become available.&quot; <br />
<br />
LOL so wtf can we do then. make a guild on PTR, invite some people on PTR, make ranks for this PTR guild, log out for 30 days, come back... OO my guild was taken away from this hunter that complains about his pet wolf not having stealth. <br />
<br />
<br />
Here is my suggestion: Give all hunter pets stealth and we wont need this guild replacement system, there i said what we were all thinking. good night xx<br />
<br />
It's really simple, if you distrust your officers, have a rank immediately below GM with the ones you DO trust. As long as they log in weekly, that will be the rank that gets the option to take over the guild, rather than anyone you suspect might take advantage of it.<br />
<br />
If you trust none of your officers, you are a bad GM, plain and simple.</div></div><hr />

Well, they are still the guild master or guild leader, just not guild owner, because no character has ever technically owned any guild in WoW. <br />
<br />
If you could disband a guild at any time for any reason, &quot;technically&quot; it is impossible for you to say that the GM did NOT own it. If you can destroy it, you own it. Unfortunately, this is another Cataclysm change that snuck past a lot of people when they made any guild over Level 3 effectively immortal. As far as I know, you cannot even leave a guild if you are the last member of it, e.g. the GM. <br />
<br />
<br />
This service already virutally exists, except that it is done via a ticket and a GM takes care of it. All this feature does is remove the need to get a GM involved.Seriously, people who think this is some huge deal really need to get over themselves. <br />
<br />
This line of reasoning is asinine. The amount of people who knew about the process beforehand was tiny, and the people who knew about it AND was willing to put in the ticket was smaller still. By making it automated, it will trigger 100% of the time, increasing the incidents of this occurrence across the board. It is the difference between someone putting in a ticket about offensive language vs Blizzard introducing an auto-offensive language detector. <br />
<br />
As for why it is a huge deal, what everyone seems to take for granted is that people the GM trusted to be officers (etc) will still care about a guild likely in disrepair. As a GM, I quit WoW two months ago after most of the people I knew stopped playing... but I may be back eventually. In the meantime, whoever is still in the dead guild will automatically become the de facto GM and have unlimited access to the guild bank, even if no one trusted them with access beforehand. Why would they have any &quot;loyalty&quot; to the dead guild? They probably wouldn't. So, whoops, there went the accumulated wealth of the guild as though we handed Loot Master to a ninja looter. Maybe I should have looted and kicked everyone before I stopped logging in? <br />
<br />
This is to say nothing about having 5 officers, and the most unscrupulous one decide to act out their hostile takeover fantasies simply because they clicked the button first. Yeah, we trusted him... back when everything was going peachy and everyone had a reason to help each other. <br />
<br />
<br />
The guild belongs to everyone that is in the guild, not just the GM. <br />
<br />
This argument is so ridiculous I'm embarrassed that more than one person is using it. If the guild belonged to &quot;everyone,&quot; then one person wouldn't be able to unilaterally /gkick you out for whatever reason they felt like. One person would not be able to dictate your bank or guild repair access. Hell, one person can literally silence your voice in /g on a whim by toggling permissions. This has zero to do with collective ownership of an organization, and everything to do with Blizzard having painted themselves into a corner by introducing Guild Leveling/Rep in an expansion that has lost them nearly one million subscriptions thus far.</div></div><hr />

We raided for 3-4 months before we lost core members and got sick of recruiting and thus the guild 'died'. Most of the old raiders are still in the guild, but hardly ever log on. The guild has 7 tabs, 6 tabs which is stuff that is specifically mine and the boyfriend's. Mats of all different sorts, flasks that /we/ bought the guild with our own gold before the guild had money. There's still 40k gold in there from our raiding days and everyone who raided still gets free repairs, so if they log on and play, they get that along with the guild perks.<br />
<br />
But here's the thing. My b/f likes to quit for a month, or months at a time. It really hasn't been an issue before if he leaves, as I'm an officer with all the power that I need to fiddle with stuff. But what happens if we both take a break? That level 25 guild, that we pretty much solo leveled with the help of 1-2 other guildies, can be stolen from us, and the new guildleader can start kicking everyone out. This. I do not like. That means, if I cancel my account, I will make sure to kick every old raider out of the guild... which sucks. Because I like them but do I trust them with the 40k gold just sitting there? Or the 6 tabs of mats that the guild didn't contribute to in the least? No, I really don't. And yet I refuse to leave with the risk of someone I raided with 6 months ago taking over with a click of a button if the boy and I both take a break. The only other option is to make several other bankalts, create guilds for them, and clean out our current guild bank. Which is another pain in the butt since almost all of my characters are 85 and I enjoy the perks that I worked so hard to earn with each one of them. <br />
<br />
I used to enjoy inviting random friends, or friends of friends, to enjoy the perks of a level 25 guild. And now I can basically be punished for being nice if we decide to take a break. Lovely. :/</div></div><hr />

I know a lot of guild leaders don't have their &quot;main&quot; character as GM and could get caught out by this. If a GM has other characters in the guild then the 30 days should apply once across all those characters, so if they log a non-GM character it resets their 30 days.<br />
<br />
It isn't a very hard thing to promote the character you are playing most to GM. I know, i'm blown away too...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't bother looking through the whole thread to see if anyone had replied to this, however they're not saying it's hard for them to test. they're saying it'll be harder for those on the PTR to test - mainly due to it requiring someone to be inactive on the PTR for 30 days, which generally isn't very likely.</div></div><hr />

Not sure what awful palce you work but depending on role and employment contract our staff get between 4 and 6 weeks leave per annum, it is more common than not to take all the leave at the same time, or even put this years and part of next years back to back - I have had 5 or 6 staff in the past 12 months take more than 6 weeks leave ina single block <br />

No, it's common to take around 3-4 weeks in the summer and the rest through-out the year.<br />
<br />
I don't see where the problem is. First of all, you have the chance to take over the GM it's not auto. Also you can always make the GM back to his rank when he is back. The problem is that you could need some of the GM features, and seriously even 30 days to me seems a lot, maybe too much.

<br />
<br />
Don't blame Blizzard because your officers are inadequate. The system is designed to stop guild stagnating because 1 person decides to bugger off for an extended period of time and not tell anyone.<br />
If you're a good guild leader with a good team of officers, leaving someone else in charge should be no problem. If you don't have players or friends like that you can trust, then it's time to perhaps look at permissions and ranks in your guild.<br />
<br />
It's dead simple, if you're going to be away for more than 30 days you let your guild know. Anyone can access the internet from almost anywhere. If it's a serious guild then you should have guild forums or a method of contacting your officers outside of the game. &quot;Oh buy what if i'm in hospital&quot; .... Then get a grip, your guild is the last thing you should be worrying about. <br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard fully understand the importance of the Guild Leader. You're there to lead, set examples and manage your guild. If you can't be that person they're making it clear that the people who should be looking up to you for guidance now have a say in weather you're doing a decent job or not. If people want to be the big cheese they have to accept the responsibility of properly running the guild, a massive part of that means having proper coverage in any period of extended absence. In your example you don't trust the officers to make the &quot;big calls&quot; so what happens when you're afk for a month or 2? That's right nothing, nada, zilch. The guild just sits there with no one taking responsibility. The issues raised don't get delt with and when you come back you have either a shit storm to deal with or a good few guild members missing due to lack or action.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another money grab? - Pul-ease. If you're not maintaining a on going subscription month to month as a guild leader then you don't really give a dam what happens to the guild then do you?<br />
This will also help stop the scumbag guild &quot;leaders&quot; who make leveling guilds with an alt, just to log in and skim the guild bank every so often with all the money that's been dumped in it from players' doing quests.</div></div><hr />

If I read this correctly (and fix it if I'm wrong):<br />
The system NOW - someone can be given GM even if they didn't ask for it, if someone else reported the GM afk for 30 days.<br />
The system COMING - You only are given if you're online and agree. If you're not online or don't agree, it will be given to someone else.<br />

<br />
If you're not online, or have quit the game, you're no longer leading the guild. You can't lead the guild if you don't play the game. If you're not leading the guild, you shouldn't be the guild leader. How hard is that?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc45d586ea8a</div><div class="date">2011-10-01, 09:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've never ever posted on these forums, but with this feature incoming I really wanted to give my opinion about it.<br />
<br />
Let me first explain my situation, i'm running a ten man raiding guild and we raid for three days per week. However we never raid the whole year, we basicly raid for some months and when we've cleared most of the content or when we feel like it's enough again, we stop playing and switch to another game for some time. Then when new content gets released, or when we simply feel like it, we get back to raiding. My raid group consists of mostly irl friends, so that's why we're capable of easily starting the raids back up again. <br />
<br />
The periods where we stop playing usually take around longer then 30 days. So basicly what will happen now, the guildleader, officers and raiders will be inactive for 30 days and a social rank or friend of a raider who logs in after that period can simply take over the whole guild, since he's the highest rank logged in. This means that a random member that has put no effort or very little in the guild, just got a free guild. And all of the people that worked really hard building the guild up, lose everything they've worked for. Since most of the guildmembers are irl friends, we also have holidays together and most of the times these holidays take longer then 30 days. Basicly all the people I trust to take over the guild, officers and some raiders are simply inactive during the same period. <br />
<br />
If this system launches I get forced to either kick everyone from the guild that I don't trust to take over the guild or I need to keep paying subscription, while i'm not even playing, to log in, to make sure the inactive guild doesn't move to a random raider friend or social rank, that can take over the whole guild and all it's valuable items.<br />
<br />
As you can hopefully understand out of my story, this system does not work for our guild. I hope they really reconsider this feature.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">greyghost</div><div class="date">2011-10-01, 10:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a great change, don't get me wrong. But I suspect the true agenda behind this is that now a guild master of any guild, no matter what they do and how small it is and if it's a leveling or raiding guild have to keep paying for game time if they want to keep their guild. More subscribers!<br />
<br />
The true agenda for this is the same for the feature of BOP items being tradeable for 2 hours after aquiring them from a boss: less people using the GM Petitions. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, this means that GMs are going to be far less willing to assist people in the event that their guild leadership vanishes and they're unable to get a successful resolution for guild control if, say, the person who manages to become GuildLeader first completely shuts down access to the guild bank / takes the money for himself, ect.<br />
<br />
So yanno, this will work out fine for guilds ran by responsible adults that trust each other. Not so much for guilds with antisocial/powertripping officers that were only tolerated or kept around by the guildleader because it's his cousin's kid or he thought the guy was funny.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What you seem to misunderstand is that this system has been in effect ALL ALONG. At any point, once you have been offline for 30 days, that social member had the ability to request to be made GM. That has not changed. The only difference is that is being handle in-game without the need to submit a ticket.<br />
<br />
If you trust your social member to not attempt to take over the guild, then you have nothing to worry about, and don't need to overreact by kicking people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We certainly didnt! We moved to a new guild when our guild leader showed no interest in coming back after around 2 months. After getting the guild to lvl11 we abandoned it and started another (just got to 19). If we had known....... (guess we all missed something in a patch note sometime ago)</div></div><hr />

My free 30 days a year from being in the military would like to say Hi. Also all my use or lose days would like to say shhh be quiet.<br />
<br />
PS: I have the power as a guild leader to empty the guild ranks completely therefore I OWN the guild. Regardless of what any of the other people want to say. If they had a part of the ownership of the guild I wouldnt be able to just kick them just for funzies.</div></div><hr />

Well there you go in the 20 seconds i had to think of that at 4am i've already thought of why this is stupid. and my finally my favourite part - &quot;Inactive guild leader replacement is currently live on the PTR, but keep in mind that it may be difficult to test, as a guild leader will need to be inactive for a full 30 days before the option to transition leadership will become available.&quot; LOL so wtf can we do then. make a guild on PTR, invite some people on PTR, make ranks for this PTR guild, log out for 30 days, come back... OO my guild was taken away from this hunter that complains about his pet wolf not having stealth. Here is my suggestion: Give all hunter pets stealth and we wont need this guild replacement system, there i said what we were all thinking. good night xx<br />
<br />
Annnnnnnnd..... BREATH! Phew, thats better isnt it? Less coffee maybe?<br />
<br />
Joking aside, this has nothing to do with hunters and pets, or people &quot;taking a guild for themselves&quot;. The guild doesnt &quot;belong&quot; to the guild leader anyway unless its his bank guild it belongs to all the members that make it work. He (or she) simply LEADS it. You cant LEAD without being there. If you lead a guild and care about it and are having to go away from WoW for a while, you would WANT to pass it over to someone else so that the guild can carry on functioning.<br />

Shouldn't even be an option.The guild leader owns it,just cause they want to study for uni or concentrate on a work project for 3 months,they should not lose their property.The officers should have access to all the tabs anyway if they wish to clean it out and start another guild.Even though they feel robbed of their guild achievements/history...to fkn bad,it belongs to the guild leader plain and simple.For instance if you own a house and decide to go on holiday why should your flatmates/tenants be able to claim the house.<br />
<br />
Guild leader is like a company managing director...... He doesnt &quot;own&quot; the company (usually) and can be replaced by the shareholders or board of directors. His role is to LEAD the company, not to own it. The only thing the guild leader did special to create the guild is get 10 other people to sign. Its all the work BY OTHERS that MAKES the guild after that.</div></div><hr />

with this new system you cant say to blizzard &quot;hey im gona afk for 30 days, plz dont kick me&quot;, its all automated and it doesnt matter if you tell everyone or not that your going away for a month - your guild can get taken away from you regardless... there is no arrangements! unless you pass gm to an officer but again! you can be shafted<br />
<br />
If you are a guild leader and are worried about this then either a, get new officers you can trust or b, stop being a guild leader in the first place because you are too insecure.</div></div><hr />

How? They didn't change anything? They automated something they were having to do manually through tickets. Your post makes no sense.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">F-Minus</div><div class="date">2011-10-02, 09:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's just another feature that may be welcome for some guilds but is totally wrong for others. If the guild is set-up properly you don't even need the GM around. We're a bunch of friends playing together, but I'm basically the GM of the guild. The GM is a level 1 alt, hanging in Orgrimmar/troll AH/Bank tent, and it wasn't logged in for about 5 months, because we don't need any of it's abilities. <br />
<br />
The officers can take out 1000g/day or repair for equal costs. The take out limit for first few tabs is 25 stacks/day and for the expensive stuff it's 5/day. Nobody complains, it's enough. The raiders or the core team, can repair or take out 500g/day, they also can take the same amount of stacks out as the officers. <br />
<br />
Socials (friends of friends of friends) have a 200g/day repair limit (with no money takeout option) and can only see the first 4 bank slots, in which they can not deposit but can take out 5 stacks of each slot. <br />
<br />
The guild just functions, without the presence of a GM. So don't tell me you need a GM to do your stuff. Any guild that raids should and probably has similar setup, and if they do, the GM is not important at all. The in-game recruitment is shallow to say the least so it's not even worth using it. You probably need to log your GM once a year to set up maybe a new rank, or buy another bank slot (if you don't have it already) everything else is just not important past the first setup. <br />
<br />
That said, we got about 13 people who actually contribute to the guild and who brought the guild up to level 25, donate gold, items. The other 235 members are friends of our members, or friends of friends of our members which have a social rank, but still take guild repair benefits and are even able to get some stuff out of the first few bank slots, sometimes we even put BoE epics there that don't sell for them to take out if they desire, along with recipes, enchant formulas, plans, food and what not. <br />
<br />
I don't want those 235 guys to have any chance to even come close to a higher rank then social, since that's what they are, they don't have any obligation to the guild, but they have benefits of being in one such guild. They should be happy enough they are harboring somewhere so lenient and get shit loads of stuff for free. I didn't beg them to join, it just happened, that they got invite by some core members, they don't really bother me and I don't bother them.<br />

That said the guild was created in July 2005 and is an old guild. And even tho we are friends and I can trust with my balls almost everyone with an officer rank, I still wouldn't want to give up the guild to any one of them. Simple fact. We play together for ages, but we're thousand kilometers apart. I don't know anyone personally, we have shit loads of fun, we joke, we cheer, we kill bosses. The guild has a sentimental value for me, and I do think, the ones who created a guild have more of a right deciding what happens with it as any random guy that joined 3 years later. <br />
<br />
I don't think we'll ever come across this 30 day problem, still I think there should be some ownership philosophy in this game. Every day something is taken from player in this game. So it's just boiling more and more. Why not implement a temporary GM after those 30 days, with all the abilities of the original GM, just not being able to disband the guild? <br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if you're an adult but if you were working you would know that you can't actually take all the days at the same time.<br />
<br />
This is not a rule. It depends. I got 25 days and I can take them all at once if I so desire, so does my father which has 43 days.</div></div><hr />

At any point, once you have been offline for 30 days, that social member had the ability to request to be made GM. That has not changed. The only difference is that is being handle in-game without the need to submit a ticket.<br />
<br />
If you trust your social member to not attempt to take over the guild, then you have nothing to worry about, and don't need to overreact by kicking people.<br />
<br />
<br />
For other people; read my previous post on page 9, I have explained my situation there.<br />
<br />
Well it's not something I misunderstood, but I simply wasn't aware that this feature has always been active already, only in a different form. That makes me really scared, because all the time when me and my officers and raiders were having a raiding break, a random social member or a friend of a raider, could have simply taken over the whole guild with all it's belongings. Everything, me, my officers and raiders have worked for, would have been transferred to a random person who has put very very little or no effort at all in the whole guild.<br />
<br />
I can understand that this system may work for some guilds, but in our case i'm left to either log in once a month to make sure an inactive guild doesn't transfer to a person that has put no effort in the guild or i'm forced to kick everyone that I don't trust taking over the guild during our raiding breaks, this means that it's going to be even more annoying to start the raids up again after a break. <br />
<br />
I'm running a company and it's running really well and because of that we're going to climb the mount everest during the summer with most of the people from that company. We did the climbing, had a great time, but we're all looking very forward to get back home and start working again. We got back and find out that the guy, that always cleans the desks on thursday, took over the whole company because, he was the highest ranked employee after 30 days..........<br />
<br />
I'm the guildleader and i'm responsible for the guild including the guildbank with alot of valuables. The raiders expect that I take good care of everything related to the guild. But with this feature incoming or the feature that is already active (ticket gm) it's going to be quite a shock to find out that a person who has put no effort in the guild and is simply only benefitting of the perks we earned, took over the whole guild with all his belongings. The officers and raiders will blame me, because I should have logged in every 30 days. Don't let me pay 11 euro's to log in once a month, to make sure an inactive guild stays secured...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfortunately, this means that GMs are going to be far less willing to assist people in the event that their guild leadership vanishes and they're unable to get a successful resolution for guild control if, say, the person who manages to become GuildLeader first completely shuts down access to the guild bank / takes the money for himself, ect.<br />
<br />
So yanno, this will work out fine for guilds ran by responsible adults that trust each other. Not so much for guilds with antisocial/powertripping officers that were only tolerated or kept around by the guildleader because it's his cousin's kid or he thought the guy was funny.<br />
<br />
So my true agenda: More subscribers due to guild masters keeping their subscriptions = MONEY!<br />
Your true agenda: less GM tickets -&gt; lower customer support costs = MONEY!<br />
<br />
Why not both?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wowtester</div><div class="date">2011-10-04, 07:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello everyone I am going to share what I think about Inactive Guild Leader replacement...<br />
1st: 30 days inactive is short... I would suggest 60-90days at least Reason is that yes real life is important then the game overall. In situations like people having bad situations where they are in the hospital for more then 30 days and not able to contact (no internet)<br />
<br />
2nd:About the situation who the Original Guild Master can trust is very in the hands of who he or she give it to <br />
(It could either be someone he or she does not know in real life and just faking to be nice until the time comes to take advantage or something while other cases could be that you know the person from real life and know his or her personality and is really trusted)<br />
<br />
3rd:If this system is going to be randomly first come first serve thing then you going to have more problems then solutions in this game. We have ninja who would take all the gold or items from out the guild bank once they have Guild Master or could Disband the whole guild or kick out people whenever, where ever. This situation needs to be fix and need to be think through about security reasons.<br />
<br />
4th: It would be a good suggest for the ORIGINAL Guild Master to set up things of what to take out in the same tab while others items in the same tab can not be taken out and how much gold can be taken out per Month from the whole guild members. So when the next person get Guild Master they can run it.<br />
<br />
5th: (I suggest you make a system call Guild Master assistance{Meaning do not have too much power like the original Guild Master but can run the guild normally}) <br />
For example If the Guild Master (Original one) is gone for more then 30 days and the next random person gets Guild Master Please do not make the guild master assistant be able to Disband or take gold or items that is unnecessary to get out. Only items that the Original Guild Master assign for the Guild Master Assistant can do while he or she is inactive.<br />
<br />
6th: I suggest that when the new person is Guild master and through 6 months-1 year the ORIGINAL Guild master is still not there... then the person who is assistance can take over the guild from there... I am just saying give the Guild Master (Original) the Chance to come back online. Many situations happen and can not be solve within 30days.</div></div><hr />

Stop your QQ about how 30 days is too short, just make a rank with your most reliable person in the guild so they get GM. Once you get back have them promote you back. Its not hard to understand, please enough with this &quot;OH ITS GOING TO BE ABUSED&quot; crap. 30 days is a long time.</div></div><hr />
