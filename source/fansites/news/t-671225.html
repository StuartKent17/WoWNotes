Seriously, 17 dust from 1 abyss crystal? Granted thats most likely not gonna happen very often but its going to rape the market for those materials.<br />
Especially since you can farm the abyss crystals from ToC which is a cakewalk.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Atleast on my server its shards that are in short supply.<br />
<br />
<br />
Same dusts / essences are pouring in and abyss crystal prices are still dropping (have a couple people who chain farm ToC normal for DE crystals, a good group can get a stack of crystals each a day (7 crystals per run x 70g each / 5 party members = 98g per player per clear).<br />
<br />
Dream shards on the other hand are harder to get and top chanters need a lot of them to buy recipes. They should put in a transmute, make it a 2-4hr CD, where you take 10 dusts and transform it to a dream shard. It would be more economical to sell the 10 dusts and buy a shard but dealing with AH pros and getting chain undercut but 1-2s gets frustrating and because enchanting mats are free to post the competition can be brutal.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">boneschaman</div><div class="date">2009-09-30, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it's 3.7 dust and 1.9 essence per crystal.<br />
<br />
it's not worth it on my realm</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haxxored</div><div class="date">2009-09-30, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From your limited pool of attempts we can infer that the shatter results in ~10 dusts or 3 essences per shard.<br />
<br />
So assuming dusts sell at 4g each (many servers mat prices are lower than this but lets just be optomistic) thats 40g per shatter for mats. And if essences are 25g each (essence prices arn't as hard with the new enchanting guide) thats 75g per shard.<br />
<br />
Assuming that it produces dusts or essences at an equal rate that's 57.5g average abyss DE. Some times you're going to hit the lottery and get 6x essences but assuming that the %ages are correct (big assumption with such a small pool) it should play out arround 58g per shard which at current market price is lower than the value of the in tact abyss.<br />
<br />
We need to pool a lot more shatters to get a proper estimation but from a money making stand point this seems like a bust unless dust / essence prices make a comback to the 5-6g per dust 30g per essence range.</div></div><hr />

With all the people running heroics for emblems with no use for bosses blue drops? :o<br />
<br />
<br />
Problem here is that all the heroics are BoP so you must be in the raid to get a shot at the item and the general rule of thumb is if your a chanter and want to DE all the blues everyone gets to roll on them at the end of the raid. Therefore if you run a heroic and lets say you collect 4 blues and the final 1 epic. You have a 80% chance of ending up with a dream shard and a 20% chance of getting the abyss. <br />
<br />
The lvl 80 enchanting recipes require 10 dream shards each to learn ignoring the abyss crystal that's 12.5 heroics per recipe, and you have to deal with rolling off shards at the end (pain in the butt). Honestly if I'm in a decent pug I just greed roll the blues and what ever I get I de later it's possible to get lucky and win 2x or 3x items in a heroic where as the rule of thumb with DEed shards is everyone gets no more than 1.<br />
<br />
Best bet is to just buy the shards off AH since the time spent running the dungeons is less g/hr than farming or doing dailies. If you have a crafting alt you can de blue crafted mats but most of the time it's a net loss in terms of mats - shard price and only worth it when you factor in the skill up.</div></div><hr />

Hehe, check posts from before the first enchanting change when mats were decreased.... Everyone was bitching they had more than enough blue shards from all the heroic's being run and proffessions that were being crafted (blue shards went to 2g each on my server at wotlk rls) while epic shards were way over 100g min price!<br />

<br />
The crystals are worth at least three times as much as the average value of the DE.<br />
<br />
I don't really see the point of this. Nobody would be stupid enough to DE crystals, which are already in very short demand.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sturmbringe</div><div class="date">2009-09-30, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, here`s a snapshot of the Market as I have followed it (Your individual mileage may vary):<br />
<br />
Abyss Crystal: 49-70ish g<br />
Dream Shard: 60g and over<br />
Greater Cosmic Essense: 30ish g<br />
Infinite Dust x20: 100-120g<br />
<br />
You can now see why Blizzard made this change. The rarest material is Dream Shard imho. Makes a Berserking enchant worth over 600g if you buy Dream Shards and dust/essences from the AH.<br />
<br />
Usually, infinite dust and greater cosmic essence is not hard to come-by. You just DE all the greenies you get from Daily Heroics (through a friend), Abyss Crystals are free from the Guild Bank, which makes Dream Shards the hardest to come-by.<br />
<br />
BTW, Blizzard reads MMO Champ very often it seems, even more often than EJ I`d wager.</div></div><hr />

Not worth shattering those abyss crystals at my server's prices. Though this being available will help keep abyss crystal prices above 36g rather than continuing to crash like they've been since ToC5 opened.</div></div><hr />

Very sorry to burst your bubble but you bought the wrong thing.<br />
<br />
It requires an Abyss Crystal per shatter, and depending on your servers economy those range from 50-80g. Might still be profitable depending on the server. Hope you can find a use / sell back all those Dream Shards.</div></div><hr />

We have ~1000 of em in our bank atm and we only use, what like 4 of em, every once in awhile and then blow a couple hundred gold on the Infinite dust we need for the rest of the enchant. Will be very nice to take a few hundred of those crystals and burn them to get dust/essences and actually be able to do high end enchants that are fully guild farmed. <br />

That price differential is actually a huge potential money maker. Even if you're on a PvP realm you can now make the other faction characters so they could implement faction change. Simply using the neutral AH to play off such a huge price difference moving Alliance mats over to horde side is a massive money maker to be made only cost your going to incur is the 20% neutral AH fee but with 100% higher horde prices you're still looking at 50-60% return on your money.</div></div><hr />

I wonder why this was not hotfixed in the US servers :s, maybe it was an unintended hotfix, this was supposed to go live on 3.2.2, but it never made it...</div></div><hr />

They should put in a transmute, make it a 2-4hr CD, where you take 10 dusts and transform it to a dream shard. <br />
<br />
<br />
That would be interesting. Shards are harder to come by on my server and I'm still in the process of trying to top off my enchanting. All my shards are going towards enchants atm.</div></div><hr />

Dust = 4g ea<br />

Abyss = 35g<br />

I just bought 20 abyss at 30 each, and had some good procs, and as a fellow poster said, the chat window is being spammed with auction successful. <br />
<br />
This is like anything new, be it when Inscription came out, or when epic gems from prospecting titanium. Itll be awesome money for those that get it done early, but you gotta be quick. Thankfully not many people on my server seem aware of this yet, as Abyss are still being posted at around 30-35g....<br />
<br />
Im keeping 100 abyss back for when the penny drops, and the price of abyss doubles :D</div></div><hr />

Blizzard did this for end-game raiding guilds who have stockpiles of Crystals in their bank. Take my guild for example, been together for a decent amount of time and have somewhere around 500 Abyss Crystals in the bank. It will be very nice to shatter these and turn them into USEFUL mats.<br />

But what I find funny about Bou's enchanting money making post, ALL the earth and shadow dried up, ALL enchanting mats dried up and whatever is left is ASTRONOMICAL. Kinda different than expected. I didn't account that if the item that makes the dust dries up, there's nothing to DE and therefore no mats left. I figured we'd be drowning in enchanting mats. Alas... no.</div></div><hr />

It's all brand new, people are going to buy all the abyss out there and turn em into everything else. After about 2 weeks, the people who weren't doing it before will get bored and find it wasn't the instant wealth button once they figure out it takes more than 10 minutes worth of time and studying. Then everything will go back to normal and it'll balance out of ALL the enchanting mats and no droughts of one kind with a flood of another.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I give it two to three weeks. After that, the shitstorm stirred by the guides and this change should subside, as majority of the new AH masters find out that they are, in fact, losing money and doing dailies was more profitable. In the meantime, the older casual market players will just withdraw from the market, and the ones that know AH inside out (or just find themselves sitting on a ton of suddenly very valuable goods) will make a fortune out of the inexperienced.</div></div><hr />

I love how ignorant you are, this guide that boub has posted isn't something new. What he just did was show what practically 75% of all wow player does in each server already. The economy is fine as it is, the only thing that killed the economy on abyss was the release of normal 5man ToC which each boss drops epic instead of just the last boss like every other instance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dirtybanker</div><div class="date">2009-09-30, 11:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While it is true many players knew how to use AH. I would argue most of them found an area they wanted to deal in and made there money there(as opposed to quick scanning the entire AH for snatch deals). We do have the people who autopost the 6 gold glyphs until there is no competition and then repost at 60 or 100gold, but again..that's a focus area. I am among the wealthiest non guild bankers on Sargeras and use Auctioneer. I did not use elaborate snatch and quickbuy/sell mods. <br />
<br />
However, when a thorough guide such as these are plastered on the front page of MMO it does have an effect. I've already noticed people sitting afk at the AH, I can only presume botting for full ah scans on various buyback/DE/whatever deals. Eternal shadows are something I never worried about, had a 100 in reserve and bought them for 2-3 gold each. Now they are dried up overnight. I've noticed significant price changes on a few other items as well, such as borean leather, which has doubled in price...<br />
<br />
It could be a fluke, or a temporary glut of newbies attempting to ride the wave of such in your face instructions on a popular site..but I would not be surprised if these front page guides do not change the economy permanently.</div></div><hr />

Get a guildie that is not a douche and help them get shards for your enchants so your not paying for anything. Because if you don't help you're a douche :) And i mean a dirty filthy douche not a fresh clean one!</div></div><hr />

Good. &quot;First!&quot; posts are egotistical and does nothing to contribute to the forum. No one cares about your &quot;First!&quot; post and often people look down on those posters as annoying children just wanting attention. <br />
<br />
Cheers to the moderator for kicking you.<br />
<br />
On another note, I think this Abyssal Shatter is great. Sure, it'll hit the existing market hard but that's just the way supply and demand works. If one opportunity of making money is gone then others will come in to fill its spot. <br />
<br />
Not everyone is losing money - someone is making a profit. The real market players don't whine about changes like this, they simply embrace the volatility and change strategy.</div></div><hr />
