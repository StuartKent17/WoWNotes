A new pet is coming to a Blizzard Store near you and ... you can trade it and sell it at the auction house! <br />
Coming soon to a Pet Store near you: the new and titanically cute Guardian Cub companion. You’ve soared across Azeroth on the majestic Winged Guardian. Soon, you'll be able to purchase a pint-sized Guardian of the Titans sidekick to accompany you on your adventures.<br />

http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/october/guardiancub1_small.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/october/guardiancub1.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/october/guardiancub2_small.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/october/guardiancub2.jpg)<br />
<br />
Stunning good looks and adorable, supersized eyes aren’t all this new pet has going for it. The Guardian Cub is also the Pet Store's first tradable pet, meaning it can be swapped between characters in-game or given as a gift to guildmates, friends, family, or that special someone -- no adoption papers necessary. Due to his finicky nature, each Guardian Cub will only give its allegiance to one owner, meaning it’s a one-time-use pet that permanently binds to a single character. Be sure to choose a master wisely.<br />
<br />
Look for the Guardian Cub to arrive in the Blizzard Store in the weeks ahead -- in the meantime, we've prepped a mini-FAQ to explain how this flying friend will differ from other Pet Store companions.<br />
<br />
Q: How does the Guardian Cub pet work? How is it different from other Pet Store pets?<br />
<br />
Unlike the other Pet Store companions, the Guardian Cub is a tradable, one-time-use pet that permanently binds to a single character upon use. When you purchase the Guardian Cub from the online store, the character you designate will receive a bind-on-use item to carry in his or her inventory. You can either use the item yourself to permanently add the pet to your character's collection (consuming the item in the process), or -- after a brief initial cooldown period -- you can trade the item to another player so he or she can add it to one of their character's collections. Note that once the pet has been added to a character's Companions list, it can no longer be traded, so make sure you're giving the cub a happy home.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Will I be able to carry more than one Guardian Cub at a time?<br />
<br />
While a character can only have one Guardian Cub in his or her Companions list, you can have as many in your inventory as you like. Please note that Guardian Cub items do not stack, so each one will take up a bag or bank slot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: How much will the Guardian Cub cost in the Pet Store?<br />
<br />
The Guardian Cub will be priced the same as the other Pet Store pets ($10 USD). All sales of the Guardian Cub are final -- no refunds will be given once a purchase is made.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Why did you decide to make the Guardian Cub tradable?<br />
<br />
Since the introduction of the Pet Store, many players have been asking for ways to get the companions we offer there without having to spend real-world cash. By making the Guardian Cub tradable (much like the BoE mounts from the World of Warcraft Trading Card Game), players interested in the new pet will have fun, alternative in-game ways to get one. In addition to trading the pet, players can give the Guardian Cub as a gift to another character for a special occasion; guild leaders can use them to reward members for a job well done; and so on. We also hope this change will help reduce the number of incidents of scamming via trading for invalid pet codes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Could I put the Guardian Cub up on the auction house to try to make some gold if I wanted to?<br />
<br />
While our goal is to offer players alternative ways to add a Pet Store pet to their collection, we’re ok with it if some players choose to use the Guardian Cub as a safe and secure way to try to acquire a little extra in-game gold without turning to third-party gold-selling services. However, please keep in mind that there's never any guarantee that someone will purchase what you put up for sale in the auction house, or how much they'll pay for it. Also, it’s important to note that we take a firm stance against buying gold from outside sources because in most cases, the gold these companies offer has been stolen from compromised accounts. (You can read more about our stance here.) While some players might be able to acquire some extra gold by putting the Guardian Cub in the auction house, that’s preferable to players contributing to the gold-selling “black market” and account theft.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Are you changing the other available Pet Store pets (e.g. Lil' Ragnaros, the Pandaren Monk) to work this way?<br />
<br />
No, the other available Pet Store pets will continue to work as they always have.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: What about future Pet Store pets?<br />
<br />
It's too early to say how we'll handle future Pet Store pets. We made this change in response to feedback from players looking for alternate ways to get the Pet Store pets, and we're always looking into other opportunities for improvement. We're interested in hearing what players think of the Guardian Cub when it launches, and we hope you'll have fun with this new flying friend.</div></div><hr />

This is hardly as shocking an announcement as it once would have been thanks to the D3 AH. Programs like this have worked out fairly well for games like Eve...maybe someday you'll be able to get game time from gold (a la Eve)?</div></div><hr />

<br />
My guess is that the market is going to be absolutely flooded with this in the beginning, especially by current gold selling sites. Think about out: drive sale price down with market saturation by selling a $10 pet for 5k gold. Resell that 5k gold for $30 (without a coupon or working with a rep) to someone who doesn't know about the pet, doesn't want to deal with fighting hundreds of listings, etc.</div></div><hr />

I thought Blizzard said that the Blizzard store would only be for cosmetic, essentially this gives people an in-game advantage gold wise (Not that it's hard to get)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was never illegal. It's still against the terms of service. Just because blizzard is providing an avenue where they can sell something to you the customer that can then be resold for ingame gold does not grant a license for third party sites to sell gold.</div></div><hr />

This just seems a little excessive since you just had people shelve out $25 to buy the mount.<br />
<br />
At the very least, they could have provided it to those who already have the mount for free and added the price tag for those who do not. Charging everyone for what is essentially a scaled down version with stretched out eyes falls further in the realm of greed which Blizzard is starting to get known for... <br />
<br />
Also, I would love to see where the revenue these things bring in is being allocated. I can understand things such as the Cenarion Hatching for the tsunami relief in Japan as well as the Pandaren monk for charity but what about the others? Does the money go straight in to their pockets or does it actually go towards acquiring more resources since that seems to be the biggest excuse they come up with when asked to introduce something fresh in to the game. <br />
<br />
If it's for the former and they are doing it to buy a bigger Yacht or pool, screw that; if it's for the latter or they are double dipping in to it with other Blizzard titles, fantastic! Just don't say so with no proof. <br />
<br />
I won't buy it and I won't hate on those who do buy it but to those who do, understand that you are enabling them to think about more ways to nickle and dime the customers and one never knows just how far this will take us in this game or any future Blizzard titles.<br />

<br />
This is something that struck me too. For a single use pet, this is a little much. I guess it is their way to stop people from buying 10 just to make a bunch of gold. Since they are assuming that quite a few people will use it for that purpose. It sucks for those who just want the pet, but I think the pet itself is secondary to the ability to trade if for gold. At least that is what I am getting from their little Q&amp;A.</div></div><hr />

What they're doing, weather they admit it or not, is testing out a real life money = in game advantage system. In addition to that, it's basically them selling gold. There is no way they can change the fact that they've been completely against selling money, until now. Now though, since they can make money off of it, they are allowing it, even if it is a round-a-bout way they're doing so. <br />
<br />
For me, I can safely say, WoW is dead.<br />

<br />
I think the problem is that people asked for a way to get this in game with gold or some other method, not as a way for Blizzard to sell gold. I know it may be arguing semantics, but having an item obtainable via in game means, really isn't the same as selling an item for money that in turn can then be obtained by others via in game means.</div></div><hr />

While our goal is to offer players alternative ways to add a Pet Store pet to their collection, we’re ok with it if some players choose to use the Guardian Cub as a safe and secure way to try to acquire a little extra in-game gold without turning to third-party gold-selling services. However, please keep in mind that there's never any guarantee that someone will purchase what you put up for sale in the auction house, or how much they'll pay for it. Also, it’s important to note that we take a firm stance against buying gold from outside sources because in most cases, the gold these companies offer has been stolen from compromised accounts. (You can read more about our stance here.) While some players might be able to acquire some extra gold by putting the Guardian Cub in the auction house, that’s preferable to players contributing to the gold-selling “black market” and account theft. Emphasis mine. I think Blizzard has realized that they've lost the gold selling war and are trying to capitalize on it instead of fighting it. This is hardly as shocking an announcement as it once would have been thanks to the D3 AH. Programs like this have worked out fairly well for games like Eve...maybe someday you'll be able to get game time from gold (a la Eve)?<br />
I think it's more along the lines of: they were trying to fight the gold selling black market without offering a viable alternative. Without some kind of viable alternative it is really REALLY difficult to stifle that kind of demand. I knew when I saw the diablo 3 AH that it was only a matter of time before we started to see the cracks in the wall in world of warcraft.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since it is single use for one character, instead of making it $10, make it ridiculously cheap--like $1 (or less) for each pet. Then they would sell like hotcakes out of the Blizzard store, and maybe the gold sellers wouldn't bother with them, because the return on investment would be too low. (LOL, who would really buy a $1 pet on the AH for something like 50,000g from a gold selling company? ).</div></div><hr />

That is true most are, but they also have the Premium option to have extra perks too. WoW has kept the Monthy Sub, and opted to give us a lot of the extras for no charge. But each time there is a vanity item avaliable people flip out about how they think that a big business like Blizzard is fleecing the community by charging for services.

<br />
The value of real money is a built-in deflation insulator(if that makes sense). It will stabilize to the point where nobody will plunk down 10 dollars just to sell for a measly 1k. I would expect it to vary between 10k-20k-ish. Nobody's obliged to sell for less than they think it's worth. If the price is too low, people will just hang onto it until the price rises again.</div></div><hr />

The difference often is, WoW has a subscription fee. Other games are often free to play, so the only way they make their money is with these &quot;fashion&quot; items etc. you can buy. It's more of another subject though. For instance, switching servers in WoW costs reallife money (10 euro's or so), while you already pay 13 euro's or so a month and while the whole service is 99.9% automated. That's disgraceful. There's where the anger of players starts. You can feel it's not justifiable for a game that already costs you money. These &quot;fun&quot; pets however, I don't give a sht. They can cost 5, 10, 20 euro's and still be tradable ingame, I don't care much. I don't see how it hurts me. I just don't buy the pet.</div></div><hr />

It does harm the game. In a game where players depend on the economy of their servers to not only be able to keep up with gold sinks, avoidable inflation like this will harm it. This is just the first step.</div></div><hr />

I'd jump at anything below 30k to be honest. I can sell rare pets for 20-25k easily on my server, this one should be even more expensive, costing real money, and thus normally being rare. Though initial market might be somewhat mroe forgiving, with people trying to cash in and, being unexperienced on the pet market, charging too little OR getting caught in an undercutting situation where 2-3 people drive the price down.<br />

As for the implications of buying gold in this way, meh, people that wanted to do this always did fnid a way, now there is a legal way to do it, even if it is slightly risky too, in a way.</div></div><hr />

and because of that, not many people may buy it to sell via AH. 20k gold is £10, this pet is £10, So the pets going to sell for 20k gold on every server? somehow i dont think so.</div></div><hr />

I think people are over estimating how much these things are going to sell for in game. There's going to be a lot of supply and not enough demand. Maybe not right away and some people might get rich off these things in the beginning but it's going to pass.</div></div><hr />

While our goal is to offer players alternative ways to add a Pet Store pet to their collection, we’re ok with it if some players choose to use the Guardian Cub as a safe and secure way to try to acquire a little extra in-game gold without turning to third-party gold-selling services. However, please keep in mind that there's never any guarantee that someone will purchase what you put up for sale in the auction house, or how much they'll pay for it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jedek</div><div class="date">2011-10-10, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hm..why do people scream bloody murder about this, when TCG cards would be on trade for up to 600 dollars. Apparently it is okay for you guys that People not affiliated with the game make money out of it but not Blizzard? oh yeah..and here is to the ones who always cry &quot;Blizzzard never listens to the fans&quot;....&quot;Since the introduction of the Pet Store, many players have been asking for ways to get the companions we offer there without having to spend real-world cash. - Hmmm seems they listen, but you guys might not like it. Ah well...lets see how it works out in game. The shitstorm on forums vs reality.<br />
<br />
The reason people are screaming bloody murder about this is it will effect the ingame economy and does give players an unfair advantage. My prime example is EVE online. They introduced sellable game time. You could buy game time for cash and sell it ingame as an item. It gave the community an instant way to make money. This did effect the economy and while it didn't kill the game, the fact you can go drop money for ingame cash so you can buy that sweet new item is a drag on the game. This is legal gold selling, Blizzard just copied CCP and made sure they got their cut for allowing it.<br />
<br />
The interesting component will be watching how traditional gold sellers adjust their prices. I think you may see people buying more illegal gold because the price is forced down.</div></div><hr />

I was really looking forward to the next expansion, but if they go ahead with Blizzavision-sanctioned gold selling, there is frankly nothing they can announce at Blizzcon that will make me keep giving them my money. One thing that's kept me playing WoW as long as I have is that at the core of it, it's had some degree of enforced fair play. It wasn't LEGITIMATELY possible to buy your epics with Daddy's credit card and zero in-game effort. This will put WoW on a par with all the other games I've tried and discarded because of the amount of advantages available to people who are willing to spend tons and tons of RL money. I will not pay for a game that does this, and if this is where all MMO's are headed, I'll go back to single-player RPG's, pen-and-paper RPG's, and RP chatrooms with my friends.</div></div><hr />

The main issue I have with this pet however is that if this pet can be sold in game via Ah or any other method, you can buy one, sell it and then buy Bind on Equip gear from the Auction House. For example, the current patch 4.2, a new level 85 (Death Knight) with no alts and no cash can sell this pet, and then buy Osbidium Cleavers. So you can now pay to advance, not cool in my opinion...</div></div><hr />

The process still stands. I saw that you linked a site that sells tcg's. This doesn't change the fact that someone had to buy those packs, find the loot cards, then put them up for sale. In fact you are proving my point. Visit ebay or that site you linked. TCG's on sale for money... Then you have to bid, and wait for the card to ship, or for them to email you the code and hope that it is valid. This Blizzard method cuts out the uncertainty and time sink, and makes selling boe's in game money makers.<br />

<br />
Hello Guild Wars 2, you may not be the same as WoW with your premium services, but it will be alot better than the flooded market of gold selling to come from Activision/Blizzard.<br />
<br />
For those of you arguing about the TCG, it was never guaranteed whenever you bought booster packs to drop a rare card that could be sold. And even then THESE ITEMS WERE/ARE STILL RARE on the server market. This service pretty much supports the gold selling market by making an official means of selling gold for their players. The only downside to this is that its a pet item, and while not everyone will care for it (The pet store was always a scam, to hell with buying shit on top of my subscription) there will be people who buy it to get an economic gain over their competitive raiders.<br />
<br />
Imagine having a competitive guild, while everyone is gearing slowly through heroics, one person decides to sell this pet for say 20-30k gold. which in turn, helps them obtain a BoE BiS epic from the current tier off the AH.<br />
<br />
This said person now joins a top tier guild and obtains server first by fulfilling his role as tank/dps/healing.<br />
<br />
What is the result? a Server first being obtained because someone got a small boost from selling an item on the AH with real money.<br />
<br />
While it is a heavily exaggerated scenario, don't lie to yourself and say this cant happen.</div></div><hr />

I saw that you linked a site that sells tcg's. This doesn't change the fact that someone had to buy those packs, find the loot cards, then put them up for sale. In fact you are proving my point. Visit ebay or that site you linked. TCG's on sale for money... Then you have to bid, and wait for the card to ship, or for them to email you the code and hope that it is valid. This Blizzard method cuts out the uncertainty and time sink, and makes selling boe's in game money makers.<br />

<br />
Did I ever specifically mention &quot;really rare loot cards,&quot;.... no, you can make money off of any of the loot cards. I do have a clue, it just isn't worth the amount of time you have put into it. Why are you so angry? Probably because the Blizz method of gold selling will quickly supplant the TCG method.

Also, to people saying &quot;this started 5 years ago woth TCG stuff noobs, you are late&quot;, getting gold that way is not that profitable. You have to buy decks, and pray to get something worth selling, sometimes not getting shit from the deck. Or go to TCGloot and buy something at 600$ and try to sell it in trade (gl with that). Now, here we have a transaction that costs only 10$, and lets say it can give you 4k per pet if your server's AH is flooded. That looks like gold buying straight from Blizzard to me.</div></div><hr />

Half these idiots don't know how gold selling is. Gold selling is usually in act of stealing or compromising accounts and taking all the gold off of it. What general happens after that is Blizzard gives all the compromised items back to the victim which means the Gold was duplicated. Which means if you had max gold the gold farmer has max gold and so do you. Which means influx of gold. This isn't the same. Person A: Buys the pet puts it on the Market then Person B: Buys it with his gold that he got from questing. There was no extra gold introduced in the processes. (Unless they bought from a third party source which I doubt) Now as for Blizzard introducing this doesn't affect me one bit. Because I'm not going to by it either way.</div></div><hr />

This is what is going to happen. A moron who thinks that he has a grasp on the economy will just buy like 100 of them and after that he will find out that due to inflation they are worth only 100-200g. The end result is blizzard making a lot of money!!!</div></div><hr />

I'm not arguing for the sake of it, I was just responding to your seemingly angry post. Yes the TCG method is legal, but utilized by few, and Blizzard did not get a cut.

But I'm surely not going to buy a 10$ if only 1 out of 20 characters can get it. Seems like a waste of money. I MIGHT buy it on the Auction house in a far distant future, when the (ingame gold) price of this pet has dropped significantly and gold sellers sell it for around 5k.</div></div><hr />

This. At least make it cheaper! For crying out loud, it's a whole lot more difficult to reconcile spending $10 on a pet for a single character than a pet for an entire account. $10 for 10+ pets across an account is a much better deal than spending $10 on a pet for only one character.<br />

<br />
Sure the first month you may be rightly able to sell them easily for anywhere between 10-50k but then all the pet enthousiasts have it and the market will mostly dry up and you'll be stuck trying to sell them and waiting maybe a week or 2 before you do sell them. <br />
<br />
I trade high value pets all the time, sometimes farm them a bit if I'm in the mood. To sell those expensive pets takes time and patience. It's not going to be a question of simply buying them and getting money, not by a long shot.<br />
<br />
In the end there will be a huge uproar over nothing and the effect of it on what we do in game will be small.</div></div><hr />

WoW is definitely becoming less and less about the customer and more and more about how much profit they can make every quarter. Screw you Blizz, screw you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This ^.<br />
<br />
There will be so many of the damn things on the AH from people who are trying to make some quick gold, that they won't be worth shit. $10 of real world money for maybe 1,000 in-game gold? Um, no thank you. Worst idea ever. Blizzard is the ONLY winner in this situation, not the players.</div></div><hr />

The post I quoted didn't really relate to the news, but to gold selling.<br />

Both are illegal (in most countries anyway), and both are impossible to stop.</div></div><hr />

There has also been a rise in gold sellers trading game time for gold.What you dont realise is that Blizzard not so long ago started to set watches on accounts that held a lot of gold for suspicious activities as they were normally gold seller accounts hoarding (which has led to less compromised accounts but still hacking and trading game time for gold). Blizzard as a business loses out to this, but also encourages people to find quicker and more efficient methods of gaining gold to sell.<br />
<br />
I would say that a lot of you on here are screaming martyrs, I know plenty of people who have bought gold, I wont say for sure that I havent and I know plenty of top end guilds that buy in lots for new patches to buy the latest BoEs at huge prices. Blizzard cannot beat gold sellers with their current model, its a simple fact.This is an efficient and non-gamebreaking way of allowing people to buy gold out of game for people that maybe dont have the time to farm it. Dont bother saying its easy to aquire gold in game, we all on this forum know that (speaking for the majority) but we are the minority of WoW players, many only play 2 hours a week and dont have the time to invest their downtime in reasing complex gold guides. <br />
<br />
<br />
This will protect accounts, peoples credit cards and Blizzards integrity. They are not about to sell epix so please calm down.If you need an excuse to quit WoW, you may as well just quit because this will only have positive effects, I for one will be buying it from the AH not out of game.</div></div><hr />

Guild Wars allowed you to unlock all of your character's skills via the online store, effectively giving them a direct advantage over other players. This did not cause the game to crash and burn.</div></div><hr />
