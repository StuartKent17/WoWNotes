Blizzard Store Updated<br />
The Battle.Net store was updated today to completely remove the old store that sold physical goods, replacing it with one that only sells the virtual items. Physical goods will be back in the future (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10587569137#12). <br />
<br />
It may look familiar, as it is very similar to the Battle.Net Launcher store mockup (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/june/mockup01.jpg)! You can find the other mockups in the original post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3267-Battle-net-Desktop-Client-Battle-net-Desktop-Client).<br />

EU Connected Realms<br />
We're not asking for perfect balance. All we're asking for is to make it so the game is actually playable.<br />
<br />
The problem is not the ratio of horde/alliance. It's that one side is utterly dead and has empty cities, practically no guilds, no crafters and barely anything on the AH, all while the other faction is flourishing.<br />
<br />
Why can't a heavily Horde server be connected to a heavily Alliance one?<br />
When the population level allows it, that's what we're trying to do with Connected Realms. But as I said before, there are for example more Horde-heavy PvP realms than Alliance-heavy ones, so that can't be done with them all.<br />
<br />
When reading sites like MMO-Champion, you can see, that Connected Realms are being pushed at US, is there a reason why you are just holding them back at EU? Would like to see a reply to this issue?<br />
We're not holding back, we started a few weeks ago and more are regularly being added http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8427764143<br />
<br />
Have you ever considered offering free faction transfers on servers with high imbalance?<br />
We experimented with it in the pastâ€”people are very reluctant to leave their guilds and friends to change sides. Also, there's a risk they could be one of just a few who move, then end up vastly outnumbered on the minority side. Judging by past trials, it's just not something people are willing to do. So we're looking for other ways to help. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/280377-connected-realms-for-unbalanced-realms/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8715481514?page=3#54))<br />

PvP<br />
explain to me why, the expac which makes pve so accessible, makes pvp (trial of glad) much less accessible?<br />
Trial is for elite players who want only skill to matter. More accessible PvP will be things like Ashran. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/401045312820621313))<br />
<br />
So again, for PvP servers, we want balanced faction mergers to make the xpac/world seem dangerous. Mergers don't solve that<br />
It's impossible to solve that. Example: there are far more Horde on NA PvP realms. We are solving it locally for 6.0 PvP zone. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400417592570961920))<br />
It's possible to solve. Give free transfers/faction changes for those in the minority populations.<br />
We experimented with that a lot in the past. Many folks don't want to move without their entire guild and network of friends. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400810477686497280))<br />
It's one of those herding cats deals where you need to motivate a lot of people to do something and everyone is scared to be first. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400810601632366592))<br />
<br />
Character / Items<br />
I approve of less gems - but why remove metas? It's the &quot;head enchant&quot;. You're keeping leg armor and should inscriptions, no?<br />
Metas aren't a decision about which to use and their procs junk up the UI and logs without adding much reactive gameplay. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/401043874618961921))<br />
<br />
I haven't seen this info. Are there melee-specific, caster dps-specific and tank-specific accessory stats too?<br />
Armor is a tank stat. Some items may have AP or SP. It's less important to have DPS-only stats, in part because there are so many. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/401042678755774464))<br />
<br />
so primary stats will be switching based on your spec. Will secondary stats change as well?<br />
No. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/401040416453062656))<br />
<br />
Will all gear 1-90 be modified to use the new 'primary' stats as well? Are secondary stats static or random on new gear?<br />
Except for hit and expertise, most of the gear changes will likely only affect new gear. We'll have to see though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400802865926508544))<br />
<br />
Active mana regen is possibly a better model than the spirit arms race? More interesting gameplay, possibly, too.<br />
Spirit is one of (possibly the) most interesting gearing decision though because it is so subjective. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400368957766369280))<br />
Inconsistent design. Other gear adapts to the wearer, but healers have to wait for spirit gear to drop.<br />
We are treating Spirit as a secondary stat, which does not adapt. Intellect is a healer's primary stat. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400807333229367296))<br />
Spirit serves no purpose outside healing roles. It is a primary stat for healers.<br />
You can call it what you want, but we call it a secondary stat, like crit or bonus armor. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/401042294964375552))<br />
<br />
So the new tertiary stats and sockets are like a mild version of the D3 random stats, right?<br />
I'd say they are more like an extension of Warforged. WoW loot will still be much less random than D3 loot. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400806314621685760))<br />
Will there be warforged items (so +6 itemlevels) together with gems and tertiary stats?<br />
Yes, but getting that trifecta will be extremely rare. Getting one of the three will be more common. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/401041834727587840))<br />
<br />
With the removal of hit/exp, will attacks no longer have a chance to miss/dodge?<br />
It will behave as if you were hit capped for yellow attacks. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400415318306082816))<br />
How about expertise? For my tank i've got 15%, and DPS class is happy with 7.5% for attacks from behind.<br />
Tanks will always hit. Melee will still have a chance to be parried from the front. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400808523476389889))<br />
make spells have a chance to be resisted from the front then<br />
We prefer tank up front, melee behind, and ranged spread out. There are plenty of encounter-specific exceptions of course. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/401039131309907968))<br />
<br />
Glyphs, Talents, Now tertiary stats, do you fear that fight to fight customizations could get out of control?<br />
That's a risk but it seems like a reasonable compromise between earning gear too quick or too slowly. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400809886545481729))<br />
This is the long tail I tried to describe. You can get good gear pretty quickly, but getting great gear takes more effort. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400810023204302850))<br />
Today, you might not get a piece for a long time, but if we just sped up drops then you might finish in 2-3 weeks. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400810185611956224))<br />
<br />
Love the item squish, but do you think it's squished enough, or will we need another one in 2-3 expacs?<br />
It's possible we'll need to do it periodically, but we made it 5 expansions before this one. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400805509072027648))<br />
<br />
People like to see big numbers and they like to see those numbers grow. Item Squish will ruin this game. #fact.<br />
The response was pretty positive among folks who tried it at Blizzcon or didn't even notice. So I guess that makes it #opinion. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400801000417538049))</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed. I like the incoming squish, and the changes to secondary stats, gems and enchants. The game just was getting crazy with how many ways you could min/max everything. Hopefully these changes will make it more about the player, and less about the class / ability to min/max as was their original intention with making raids more accessible, increasingly so with the ability to use tank/dps/healing gear in other roles. (Obviously this will not be the case with Mythic as they've said they want to add mechanics that might require one class/spec)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree wholeheartedly. In addition to the numbers getting stupid big, I personally have a tough time quickly reading some of those big numbers with everything else going on. Seems like if the numbers were squished down, I can spend less time computing the numbers and more time immersed in the experience. Seems to me the computationally it will make sense as well. (Less resources needed to compute combat actions)</div></div><hr />

Do they not understand how much this hinders ideas of melee actually evolving in any way in form of mechanics?<br />
Or how it LIMITS Melee for that matter? A majority of things that influences ranged, still has some impact on melee.<br />
<br />
So why keep to it so that melee can't be in front or do more special roles? It just feels dull to be the guy who hammers the boss and always hear &quot;Ranged do X&quot;.<br />

We are treating Spirit as a secondary stat, which does not adapt. Intellect is a healer's primary stat. (Source)<br />
What is the actual use of dynamic primary stats if spirit is considered a secondary stat? One would still need seperate Heal/DPS items. With armor the new secondary 'tanking' stat you still need seperate Tank/DPS items. So what is the point? Is it just a neat feature so people can try another spec without having to get a complete set first but will ultimately want to replace every single piece (i.e. hybrids still needing 2 seperate sets)?</div></div><hr />

Agreed, time to talent back into Safeguard, or risk being kited around more in PvP. Mass Spell Reflect isn't even a contender, imo. Wonder what Blizzard thinks this will accomplish. Instead of having several useful talents on the same row and making people choose, it's like they want it to be cookie-cutter with a clearcut choice.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">subanark</div><div class="date">2013-11-19, 04:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was really hoping they would say something about the spirit to hit conversion of hybrids, and I see it wasn't what I wanted to hear. Gearing a healer when you don't already have a healing set was hard enough, now hybrids have no use for spirit again? Ugh. Please just call spirit a primary stat again and be done with it. Or return to spirit working for dps, maybe turning it into mastery now instead of hit.<br />
<br />
From my understanding...<br />
<br />
Spirit will provide no benefit to non-healers.<br />
When gearing up as a healer, most gear slots will not have spirit on them.<br />
Healing with no spirit won't be too painful.<br />
<br />
You should be able to use a good chunk of your dps gear as healing, but will probably need to pick up a few offspec items to heal.<br />
Yes, holy paladins rejoice, the rest of the healers will be sad. Tanks will probably be in the same boat.<br />

<br />
What's the whole point of variable main stat on gear if healer gear stil need spirit on them ? And spirit being a useless stat for dps/tank it also won't help them...<br />
I really can't see any logic in this. Blizzard should go Str for plate, Agi for monk/enh/hunter/rogue/druid, int for casters dps, spirit for healers.<br />
<br />
Spirit as secondary stat just make the whole new gear system pointless.</div></div><hr />

Do you not comprehend what the red text means? Safeguard already works that way. They're REMOVING the root break from it, which IMO makes it almost useless for PVP compared to mass spell reflect.<br />
<br />
If you honestly didn't know that, it's probably safe to say you aren't the most highly skilled warrior around.</div></div><hr />

With hit being removed all spirit gear will go to healers untill they have enough and then spirit gear will be disenchanted so yes this is kinda stupid I guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Treasure goblins are from Diablo III, they appear randomly around the maps, you have a limited amount of time to kill them before they portal out with any loot they may be carrying - if you kill them fast enough they drop a large amount of gold and a varying number of items.<br />
<br />
It is extremely likely that this treasure goblin will be a pet that is included with Diablo III: Reaper of Souls Collectors Edition for anyone that plays WoW.</div></div><hr />

On Magtheridon the lag was terrible back in the later half of WotLK. Since Nihilum and later Ensidia, together with some other top 100 guilds, played there it was without a doubt the number one PvE server to be on during TBC. So in WotLK eventually the server just became a big lag fest and Blizzard offered free transfers to small shitty servers like Sunstrider and Trollbane. I don't know why they're not constantly doing this, since it really helped those smaller servers.<br />
<br />

I hope that it won't be required to have spirit on every piece of gear like it is now. That being said, I may have missed the post saying that they are increasing the effectiveness of spirit or reducing the need for spirit. Really, that was my concern. Seeing as if we still need spirit on every piece to be viable healers, this switching out primary stats dynamic gearing thing would have absolutely no effect on healer/dps's.</div></div><hr />

It is awful for everyone else being baseline, there is no way to escape a warrior on a priest in PVP, you fear, he zerker rages, you root, he intervenes, you manage to have a working use of spectral guise, he charges or stomps you, you can't cast, you're almost always perma-snared, and you're doing 25% less healing. Fuck warriors, lol.</div></div><hr />

They were too busy trying a new zone, OH AND THEY WERE NOT PLAYING THEIR OWN CHARACTERS, so it's not fair to say that people will like this, Blizzard are talking out of their ass.

Love the item squish, but do you think it's squished enough, or will we need another one in 2-3 expacs?<br />
It's possible we'll need to do it periodically, but we made it 5 expansions before this one. (Source)<br />

This was a very common practice back in vanilla and the first few expansions. It was quite common to have servers with high queue's in the first few years, and as new servers opened those usually came with a 'free character transfer' from the most populated servers to the new ones. Later on, they implemented similar free transfers between low pop and high pop server, often specifically for one of the factions.</div></div><hr />

removing hit and expertise is great but PLEASE PLEASE consider that we still have to kill mobs in our daily life, and we cant get behind them if we're alone! so please consider that hell. autoattacks okay, but same lvl attack yellow hits ahould not miss or parry. it will break many classes rotations.
