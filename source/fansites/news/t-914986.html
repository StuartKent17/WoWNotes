Official Notes Update<br />
Official notes have been updated and are awesome because they aren't the result of my crazy datamining, you know. Also these notes seems to be from a later build and any change listed there is most likely more up to date than datamined changes<br />
General<br />
<br />
All character races now have a /roar sound.<br />
<br />
<br />
Classes: General<br />

Glyphs<br />
<br />
Glyph of Dark Succor has been redesigned. Rather than placing a 15% maximum health floor on Death Strike healing while in Frost or Unholy Presence, it causes the next Death Strike within 15 seconds after killing a foe that yields experience or Honor Points to heal for at least 20% of the death knight's maximum health (still requires Frost or Unholy Presence).<br />

<br />
<br />
Pets<br />
<br />

Players will need to progress through the Hyjal Regrowth and Molten Front daily questing areas in order to unlock access to the full gamut of taming challenges.<br />

<br />
<br />
User Interface<br />
<br />
The order in which characters are listed at the Character Selection screen can now be rearranged and saved.<br />
Raid Profiles have been added which allow players to save the raid window user interface layout based on type of content (i.e. 10-player raids, 25-player raids, Battlegrounds, etc.) for future use.<br />

New &quot;/roar&quot; Sounds Added in 4.2<br />
Hey everyone!<br />
<br />
As many of you who play goblins and worgen may have noticed, the sound usually associated with your characters' &quot;/roar&quot; emote was removed in patch 4.1. This was done to help resolve an issue that caused the sounds associated with the both the &quot;/roar&quot; and &quot;/attack&quot; emotes to play simultaneously whenever the &quot;/attacktarget&quot; command was used.<br />
<br />
We know that many of you missed hearing your /roars, so we're happy to report that, in patch 4.2, goblin and worgen characters will once again have a sound associated with the emote. Even better, we're adding brand new sounds for &quot;/roar&quot; for all playable races.<br />
<br />
We're excited to be able to introduce these new sounds and hope you have a roarin' good time with the updated emotes. (Yes, I went there. Rawr. :3) <br />
<br />

since blizz are aiming to get dibalo 3 out late this year or earlyish next year i'd expect this years blizzcon to be mainly about diablo 3 anyway :)<br />
probably see heart of the swarm at E3 judging by them releasing the trailer for it just before E3,probably a tiny possibilty we could see a glipse of the terran expansion at blizzcon but would not hold hopes for it, likely just see more of heart of the swarm.<br />

im mostly looking forward to D3 anyway :) so any news about that is good for me :)</div></div><hr />

I don't even like alliance races, and I'm still going to say that Worgen (Worgen Form), Draenei Female, and Belf Female were the only ones that even sounded remotely good.<br />
<br />
A roar doesn't have to be a roar like a tiger, you always sound retarded when you roar in person anyway. A roar could be a &quot;Thundering roar of war cries from the massive army that started their attack on ragnaros' homefront, the Firelands&quot;<br />

The female Draenei and BE don't have roars, they have /attack battle cries. Unless there are two sound clips used between both /attack and /roar, that's just super lame. Also, the female Goblin sounds more like a /angry or something. The Worgen, however, sound amazing.<br />
<br />
I watched the Alliance video first, and I recently really got into my female Draenei Paladin, and the pansy battle cry substitute for a roar felt like one of those slaps in the face you only get when you finally roll a class and watch it get nerfed into oblivion. lol</div></div><hr />

When I read it, I just assumed it was a play off pokemon *shrugs* I really doubt they'll actually be any more powerful/better than any other pet of the same type.<br />

First off the game balancers don't work on sound so no effort was lost.<br />

Secondly, the roars have been in the game for YEARS. They just touched them up a bit! No time was lost. In fact here they are... (These ones may sound very quiet and strange/glitchy. But I said they touched them up.)<br />

PEOPLE! These comments disgust me! You guys are the worst fans ever! Blizz gives us a bunch of free new goodies and what do you do? You all complain!<br />
<br />
&quot;HOW dare they give us free new fun stuff!&quot;<br />

&quot;New mounts and pets? Unacceptable!&quot;<br />

&quot;The art team should stop making new art and help balance the game!&quot;<br />

Bit late on that nerf, I quit last week after growing sick and tired of ranking top 10 on 13/13 due to this stupid talent. Even without it, there are 6 year Hunter veterans barely pulling 30k on the majority of 13/13. What is the point in devoting time and energy to a game where you end up outplaying people with less than a year's experience with your class?<br />
<br />
Not to mention how stupidly easy it is to play WoW at an individually competitive level, see: don't be a retard and ensure you were not dropped at birth; profit. The only challenge in this game lies with guild-wide competitiveness, which is just something I'm not willing to dedicate precious time and energy to, especially when there are ~ 10 players (yes, even in world-class guilds, ask them yourselves — better yet, troll some logs) playing like absolute shit 'just cause'.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The way I understood the patch notes is:-<br />
<br />
They added 8 new rare tamables. These new rares will have special abilities and you wont just be able to run up to them and hit tame beast and stand still for the duration. These will actually be difficult to tame, not just to find. And the one they mentioned as the &quot;rarest and most powerful of them all&quot; is just going to be really difficult to tame. Not that it will have increased combat skills when tamed.</div></div><hr />

Sigh. It said rarest and most powerful in regards to taming...as in the new pets with have some sort of taming mechanic that will be maybe more challenging? (Think having to lay a trap/kiting/old school tactics/etc.) Please read the entire post before freaking out.</div></div><hr />

Coincidentally, it seems, this is because Worgen and Goblins were the only roars that were &quot;done right&quot; (as opposed to just being ham-fisted into a patch only because other races have them).<br />

Haha! You got it!<br />
Alot of people don't even know that Cam Clarke does the voices for the playable male blood elves. <br />
He also did the voice of Liquid Snake, Solid Snake's twin brother from the Metal Gear Solid series. Hence Wheel and Chime's comment.<br />
<br />
PS: In WoW he also voiced a couple of other characters, like Malygos and Nexus-Prince Shaffar.<br />

Completely agree with you man! While they waste time putting in unwanted crappy /roar soundfiles that most people won't hear because I think most don't play with sounds on, people will continue to be unhappy that the keyring is disappearing in 4.2 and still no tabard tab. I'm really getting sick and tired of Blizzard's decisions lately.</div></div><hr />

I thought the same thing, in that I thought It may be the pet for the Diablo III CE pet, but I am wondering, seeing that usually the blizzcon pets are murlocs with a theme (Deathwing themed murloc, SCII themed murloc) and the SCII CE pet was Mini Thor rather than a SCII themed murloc.<br />
<br />
I guess we just have to wait and see:)</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure it's the BlizzCon pet, for a few reasons:<br />
<br />
This year's BlizzCon will likely be more about Diablo than previous Blizzcons, given it's impending release.<br />
It's a murloc, which follows the BlizzCon theme (Starcraft II CE pet wasn't a murloc)<br />
The beta for D3 hasn't started yet so it likely won't be released until after BlizzCon<br />
<br />
Here's to hoping the beta starts soon though :)</div></div><hr />

Arms and Fury DPS are currently pretty much equal, and in case you didn't notice Fury is also getting nerfed. Btw, both specs are middle of the pack at best currently:<br />

Warriors have been held back in PVE because of PVP ever since cata came out. PVE is the majority of this game, PVP should be the one taking a backseat in terms of balance, not the other way around. Anyone that wants to whine about unbalanced PVP can go play CoD and stfu.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Every warrior out there can say this with an extreme sense of urgency. While our burst damage is awesome in PVP, that doesn't correlate to PVE.<br />
<br />
Can we stop basing PvE and PvP off the same spell sets already? It is getting really sad that we are continually nerfed to satisfy the PvP crowd. You must realize that there is as many PvE players as PvP players, right?<br />
<br />
What warriors really need is some form of agro dump. You want to improve PvE warriors? The first minute of a fight is by far the WORST experience a PvE player can have.<br />
<br />
If you don't understand what I'm talking about, the first 20-30 seconds of any fight for a warrior usually goes something like this: <br />
Pre-Pot<br />
CS<br />
Death Wish<br />
Rotation<br />
Rotation<br />
CS<br />
Reck<br />
Rotation<br />
Rotation.<br />
<br />
But, the problem is that most fights we simply have to *completely* stop dps, even with pre-planned Hand of Salvations and Intervenes to drop threat as much as possible, a warrior has no personal way of dropping threat... Except simply stopping DPS for a few moments. This is the worst experience you could have as a warrior. Threat is terrible, we are topping threat in every fight, except we are no where near the top of DPS for every fight. Sure, some fights we are competitive, but there are far too many fights where you constantly hear the agro warning.</div></div><hr />
