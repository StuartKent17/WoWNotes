Also, a new quest similar to An Injured Colleague (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/13986/an-injured-colleague/) has been added for the Alliance. It seems that the Highbornes are back ... (These quests do not have any real objective, they're just here to toy with your mind) <br />

General<br />
The Brood Mother Returns<br />
After years of lurking in her lair battling the many brave adventurers who travelled from afar to challenge her, Onyxia returns to commemorate World of Warcraft’s five-year anniversary.<br />
<br />
Onyxia has been scaled to offer new challenges to level 80 players and is now available for testing in 10- and 25- player modes.<br />
Adjustments have been made to the encounter to keep it fit for modern raiding, but the fundamental experience of fighting the Brood Mother will remain, as will the horror of the Deep Breaths!<br />
Some classic items Onyxia offered level 60 players will have their stats adjusted appropriately for level 80 players.<br />
Brood of Onyxia, a very rare 310%-speed mount modeled after Onyxia herself will be available for the luckiest of challengers.<br />

I think this was a PvE nerf, not arena. <br />
<br />
That Rogues who are (rightly) the best single target dps in the game, can use one button to also be one of the best AoE classes in the game was wrong. <br />
Speaking as a DK, we require to have 51 point talent (howling blast, 8 second CD btw) and glyph it, and time it's use with Killing machine, to be good. Or to be unholy with talented + glyphed DnD, wantering plague and then ensure that you have diseases up and spread around etc... all this just to be comparable to either a rogue or feral druid pressing FoK or swipe.<br />
<br />
Swipe is still currently (for one single ability) an OP form of AoE. I hope that blizz are also looking at data regarding this and may have a fix in the works.</div></div><hr />

YS0 without rogue interrupt and aoe dmg sounds bad and why bring rogue when SP mindseer do better, wait nerf SP's now then?<br />
I topped end of the fight the meter with fok spam but before top 3 was sp,sp,blizzarding mage, nerf them too since mages single target dps getting buffed and buffed every single patch?<br />
Reading the patchnote more class get cleave ability while rogues only 'cleave' has CD. Good example mimiron/kologran with warrior + cleave glyph. Our warrior does 12k dps on kologran and same on mimiron because he can hit 3target at the same time, topping council meter because at start he does rofl amount of aoe dmg to both target and so on.. But i guess its fine because it doesnt matter in arena, right?Only cap for him is threat which give us a chance to get close to his dmg. Single target dps soon means nothing when the most of the encounters needs AOE. Freya,mimiron,kologran,YS,xt(we tank sparks at melee so he and other warriors, rets can boost their dmg more),razorscale ect.<br />
Only reason we bare rogues because we are active and good players oh and easier to point rogues for interrupt.<br />
I know this is just test realm but i believe it shouldnt go to live as it is look.(making ys0 really hard, maybe impossable) Or justify the other classes to it, what i've already said, single target dps means nothing soon.</div></div><hr />

&quot;I imagine it is in addition, but can't confirm this straight away.

Why don't you get the FoK glyph then? If you want to have competitive AoE, then you have to make the sacrifice from somewhere. I have yet to see a single Rogue that used this glyph because they felt they wanted to do more AoE damage.</div></div><hr />

It would be easy to counter this ability by either spreading out to avoid the use of AoE, or by focusing on the rogue / CC it to reduce the use of the ability. A flat 30% reduction to the damage the ability does (ignoring the removal of the interrupt part) is purely becasue they felt it was doing too much damage for one single AoE ability in PvE. They did the same to DnD when they remove the fear component from the glyph, reduced the damage it did and then put the damage increase in the glyph. If a rogue wants AoE, be prepared to glyph for it now.</div></div><hr />

And I'm not suprised by the Rogue nerf - high mobility compared with other AoE abilities, highest AoE damage and an AoE interrupt was way too much for a single ability. Sucks for Yogg without Keepers, though. I guess the encounter needs a bit of tweaking if it really can't be done without FoKing Rogues.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Swipe is still currently (for one single ability) an OP form of AoE. I hope that blizz are also looking at data regarding this and may have a fix in the works.<br />
<br />
Swipe is frontal cone while FoK is 360°. Cats also regenerate energy slower than Rogues.</div></div><hr />

Read it closely, and read GC's previous comments about how &quot;extra mana&quot; would not help Arcane's DPS problems. Theyre giving you free AM's on Mbar procs, and increasing ABlasts chance to proc Mbar, and it will still reduce the base cast time of AM by 2.5s<br />
<br />
If they were changing it to a just &quot;removes the mana cost&quot; this would be COMPLETELY against what GC has said about how to fix arcane AND would be a MASSIVE nerf to arcane dps which is already in need of buffing. <br />
<br />
In short, patch notes are always poorly written and leave things out and you shouldnt get upset over what is clearly a monkey forgetting to write &quot;in addition to its current effect&quot; first.</div></div><hr />

Possibly the hardest encounter in the game (of which I'm sure you'll never see anyway, so why does it matter to you?) should NOT be &quot;possible&quot; because of a single class specing a certain way and using one ability.<br />

<br />
Sorry, the point of giving you Fan was to allow you something to contribute to aoe damage so you didnt look or feel useless during aoe times and as if your only worth was during single target bosses, and to also be able to say that you can do aoe damage so there is no justification for the old &quot;rogue should be highest single target dps since we cant aoe&quot; debate.<br />
<br />
That doesnt mean that ability should be doing nearly as much damage as it is for how insanely easy it is to use and allowing you to be both insanely high single target damage AND insanely high aoe damage. Sorry, OP is OP and should be nerfed, and it was, you'll live and you'll still use FoK regularly for aoeing, just as was intended.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hence why I'm not screaming &quot;OMG NUUURFF SWIIIPPEEE&quot; The problem is that there are very very fights with constant long term AoE, thus meaning that burst AoE &gt; channeled, slow AoE almost always. I do see swipe requires a little positioning to get it to work, but after that you stand there and use it when you have enough energy (which can be very often when you have Berserk up, Detonator wave of Freya springs to mind) and do silly amounts of damage.<br />
<br />
Now, I do still out dps the kitty on our freya kills, mostly becasue my AoE is still better than his. My arguement is that I can't just stand there using one ability to pull it off.</div></div><hr />

It's especially amusing to me because on any US server with medium or higher population you can't ENTER Shadowfang Keep right now at any time, day or night, because of the inability to launch instances.

My problem is, they are fixing only rogues not other classes, i feel unfair. Rogues has no real aoe after getting this much nerf while other classes warriors,rets does.

Seeing how much SP we get out of Strength now it will more than make up for it IMO. Plus if you're worried about not being able to keep up threat wise then you really need to learn your rotations better.

Because ys0 is about only p3? Yes its the most cruical phase but you still have to do p2 good, provide enough dps and coordination to stun the brain to dont spawn extra crushers, survive, make no mistake.<br />
And not only thats rogues task there. A, FoK yes needed B, run out with tanks and interrupt immortals to dont stand there and lifedrain when running up and back C, Correct CD useage with ToTT, ar,bf and aggro managment, make threat to tanks. Funny you say its not requires intelligence, of course not hard as tank there. But i dont flame healers for them the whole fight to stand for back to ys and spam heals or locks drainsoul over and over and over. Its their duty, role. Its mine. Blizz didnt nerf 1button locks in TBC, which admit far worse than FoK rogues atm, because its only useful on few encounter and they did it on all single encounter.</div></div><hr />

For rogues (or melees) it was never intended to top the meters on AoE fights.<br />
The Top slots for AoE fights where for the ranged classes. All melee classes were given an AoE so they had something to do on those fights (or trash). But it was clearly stated that it shouldn't be on the top<br />
<br />
FoK went over the top. It did the most damage out of all AoEs. Applied poisons and even interuppted spellcasting. And all of that while you could continue moving.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway. The Onyxia mount looks nice. And i can't wait to the the new Druid-T2 Helm stats.</div></div><hr />

Plus if you're worried about not being able to keep up threat wise then you really need to learn your rotations better. I don't pvp, but I couldn't be happier about getting rid of the prot healing abominations that taint the paladin class. We'll still be the amazing threat machines we were even after this change.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think you understand, Tisoy. Tanks in end-game raids usually have tons more stamina than strength, at least when it comes to Paladins.<br />
<br />
Not only do they nerf our Righteous Fury(which I see no reason for?), but on top of that they smack us with Spell Power reduction. <br />
<br />
Currently I gain around 780 Spell Power from my main-tanking gear, with the change that's reduced to 700. It's going to make a difference along with Righteous Fury change in long encounters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The announcement said &quot;stats updated to match the current level of content&quot;, which makes your prediction wrong before you even made it. Just because people are still running the previous level of content doesn't mean the current level isn't the Trials. Aren't sure whether Onyxia will have Heroic modes yet, but they already came as close to explicitly stating 232/245 as they ever do.</div></div><hr />

Yes it's going to make a difference. That's the whole point. The RF nerf doesn't do anything other than nerf threat. There's nothing hard to understand here, Blizzard felt Pally threat was too high and nerfed it. I personally agree with this choice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Really? Tanks in end-game raids have more Stam than Strength? <br />
<br />
Duh.<br />
<br />
We will get 60% of our strength value instead of 30% of our stam<br />
<br />
example:<br />
<br />
Old<br />
2000 Stam = 600 Spell Power<br />
<br />
New<br />
1000 Str = 600 Spell Power<br />
<br />
Granted it's not going to be quite the same seeing as our stam is often more than double our strength, it's also not that bad either. It's not going to be game breaking like you think it will be. The nerf to Righteous Fury is odd, but I think we'll be alright. Our threat is insane imo and will be looking forward to racing Warlocks to the top of the threat meters. It's just a game!</div></div><hr />

The HaT nerf really sucks, although I didn't play it in a long time, reducing the maximum cp's you can get to 1 per second instead of 1 per person per second sounds like they will kill the spec for PvE.

With RF up your holy damage goes from causing 190% threat to causing 180% threat so that is really more like a 5% reduction in your threat.<br />
<br />
Then don't forget you will get an extra 60% of the ~200 strength you will get from horn of winter when you factor in kings and talents restoring 120 of the missing spell power leaving you only about 50 spell power lower than you currently stand. <br />

Your's is still better. It's an aoe for one so you don't have to try to get in position for it. If you haven't played a Balance druid, you should know that in it's current form, Typhoon was horrible. It did nothing. It would push someone back maybe 5 yards and most melee only had to take one step to get right back into range to attack. <br />

Yea, I was wondering if that guy had even played a Prot pally since the last patch. I tanked 10 man Ulduar last night. I'm an off-spec prot pally, so my gear is okay and my rotation is sorta fine.

Remove the glyph too. FoK doesn't need these nerfs when used like other AoEs it is in line until you pop CDs with it.... hope they reconsider...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let's be realistic. You are a rogue. You are the premier single-target DPS class in the game. You should not be topping AoE damage meters over a mage or warlock in AoE situations. Why do you think volley got nerfed by 30%? You shouldn't be able to break 10k DPS on a single target using an AoE ability, regardless of any cooldowns you have to use to achieve that number. Be happy you have something to use on trash packs, remember Hyjal?<br />

So since DK has to cast PS, IT, Pestillence then drop DnD and use BB as appropriate does that mean that DK is the hardest class to play in an AoE encounter and thus should do the most damage. Woohoo, buff DKs.</div></div><hr />

Also found few other notes interesting:<br />
<br />
Feral Combat<br />
Predatory Strikes: This talent now also causes the druid’s finishing moves to provide a 7/13/20% chance per combo point to make the next Nature spell with a cast time below 10 seconds instant cast.<br />
<br />
Instant cyclones and heals every now and then... Very nice addition for kitty PvP.<br />
<br />
Retribution<br />
Seal of Command: This ability now chains to strike up to 2 additional targets when it is triggered by an attack.<br />
<br />
Now I don't really know if this is a good thing or absolutely nothing, but seems rather nice ehh..?</div></div><hr />

As a frost DK, I usually out dps everyone in my guild on AoE encounters. but only by a small amount. I have no problem with mage/lock/boomkin AoE being one button, as it is sufficiently far behind me on the meters to account for the different amount of skill it takes (CD's rotation etc) to make this difference. Rogues (and to lesser extent kitties) very nearly match me (and sometimes beat me) on AoE encounters with minimal effort. <br />
<br />
As for energy management, target management, threat management, you can go jump in a lake. Not like DK's have to to worry about ability CD's, rune cds, deathrune generation, threat management and disease uptime on multiple targets. It surprises me that you have a DK in your sig, and you don't notice this yourself.</div></div><hr />

Not exactly. Mage pre-3.2 was Living Bomb the target most likely to live the longest, Flamestrike rank 9, Flamestrike rank 8, Blizzard, repeat. Mage in 3.2 is Living Bomb, tab to next target, Living Bomb, etc. until pack is likely to die in under 12 seconds (pure judgement call), then Flamestrike rank 9, Flamestrike rank 8, Blizzard. And if the tank likes to move the packs around, or elemental shamans or boomkins use those damn knockbacks just as a Flamestrike is about to land, zero dps for that period of time.<br />
<br />
I'll take FoK, FoK, FoK, FoK, while easily moving to stay with the moving pack, thanks. Even with 30% less dps, it's mindless instead of annoying, and shadow priests still outdps mages on AoE. (Theirs *is* just spam lolsear, though, you were right there.)</div></div><hr />

We help defeat the Nerubians to use the tunnels as a back door into Icecrown? That would be legendary...<br />

I agree, partly, <br />
There is a lot of wasted space over in Zul Drak and blizz couldnt break with tradition of having atleast 1 troll raid per xpac so i guess it would have to be in 3.4 but im not sure how they could put a troll in a higher raid than arthas.. oh well.<br />
But on the other hand, all of those spells are in ref to Mr.T so i dont think they are real spells that would see much or any use in game on live realms</div></div><hr />

How about ICC is coming with 3.4, while 3.3 is going to be our new troll raid..<br />
<br />
But sooner or later they will definitly bring a troll raid during WotLK :)</div></div><hr />

So instead of prot being a Holy / Tank spec. its now going to be a DPS / tank spec..<br />
<br />
LOOOOOOOL!! You ALready do almost as much damage is Prot then as Ret. Now with strength gear your gonna have Spell power like a Retadin. but 30 second HoJ, silence Shield, and mad Defense.<br />
<br />
Seems an Interesting alternative to Dpsing as a pvp paly<br />
<br />
<br />
This was pretty much the thing i was worried about when i first heard they would take serious actions against Protection Healers in PvP.<br />

Now, as you already stated, it goes upside down making Protection/Retribution probably the deadliest PvP class/spec combination ever.</div></div><hr />

I agree that FoK was...not as it should be. And nerfing it is not the wrong way. But not fixing the rogues problems here just sucks and together with the nerf it's just a punch in your face.<br />
<br />
Yeah, you can argue that rogues are the best Single Target DMG Dealers. Question is - against whom? As Druids, DKs, Warriors and Paladins wear plate and you hardly do any dmg at all. Mages and Hunters keep you in snare and cc while bursting you down. Only Shamans, Priests and of course: other rogues are a even match. Hell, I am happy every time, I am facing other rogues in arena as I know that I have high chances to win.<br />
<br />
Melee Dmg is simply outdated. They should either change it to magic damage like the biggest rest of the classes, allow rogues wearing plate or implement mechanics with the same outcome.<br />
<br />
I played at 2100 rating before. I never was gladiator and I agree that I am not a pro. But right now there is only frustration in the arena when loosing against teams in item lvl 200 items bashing you without a chance.</div></div><hr />

EleSham - I actually have no clue what you guys press for aoe. *Chain Lightning on cd?<br />

But seriously, isn't *EVERY* class basically sit there and spam one skill over and over again?<br />

Comparing effects that require a channeling time or a casting time vs. a instant AE effect is a bullshit argument.<br />

Ontopic and relevant question: Is the effect from Missile Barrage that reduces the Arcane Missiles channeling time being replaced by the wording in these patch notes, or added ?<br />

Current wording implies it's being replaced.</div></div><hr />

Seriously though, I don't see what Holy has to worry about...

As a mutilate rogue I am not normally the highest AoEr, but I am usually in the top 5-7. As someone said before this nerf could have been done differently like not allowing BF and AR to be used at the same time as FoK. BF+FOK will always be OP no matter what the damage nerf. FoK will still do up to 18k with this being popped at the same time as AR. This nerf pretty much makes mut FoK as useful as it was when it had a 10 second CD, just a waste of energy.<br />

Edit-When I read this disscusion it made me think of all the times people do not think about how a change affects more then one spec. All I saw on here was references to combat rogues.</div></div><hr />

Like I said its OP in raids because of the synergy with COMBAT rogue cooldowns. Mut rogues are getting about the same AoE as most classes and having to sacrfice for it by having to use all their energy in two GCD's. To start a single target rotation after aoeing takes awhile for mut rogues.. Combat rogues can pretty much jump right back in and already have a ridiculous amount of damage done.<br />
<br />
Also refering to a comment about feral druid AoE. It is again combat rogues with the extra regen allowing them ridiculous aoe mut rogues have the same as you.</div></div><hr />

Yup, see:<br />

They are dumb for nerfing FoK in the manner they did, FOK spam is not powerful unless you do a few things: hit AR or BF simply removing the ability for these to work on FoK would have made it fine, give it a 3 second CD and remove BFs synergy with it and it would have been fine, also make it scale with weapon speed instead of 150% with daggers that's a poor design as well. Remove the glyph too. FoK doesn't need these nerfs when used like other AoEs it is in line until you pop CDs with it.... hope they reconsider...</div></div><hr />

So I downloaded the PTR client (I think) and when it went to install, all of a sudden its downloading 3.2.0. Is this because I didn't do PTR for 3.2.0?</div></div><hr />

<br />
THEN they come out of nowhere with these nerfs, while still not addressing any of the real pressing matters.<br />
<br />
How am I NOT supposed to feel that blizz thinks of rogues as the red-headed stepchild of wow. This sh!t is ridiculous. Go F yourselves in the A blizz.</div></div><hr />

It just seems to me that as a whole we haven't gotten any decent buffs in a while. I would love for a decent threat reduction talent instead of the measley 10% you get with destructive reach.<br />
<br />
<br />
i aggree with the threat reduction ofc and lock playstyle was booring in tbc. you have to know my fav spec is affliction and i wasnt happy when blizz made it more simple in the prev patch. it was challenging to see the dotimer and try to keep your dots up with the best uptime and the same time running out from bad nasty things...what a dpser can AND MUST do.<br />
<br />
Chronalis you have absolute right, i misstyped a little bit. the prot pally boost has begun at 2007 november and it was +10% stamina not just 2%. and since that patch we got just boosts. pre wotlk blizz boosted prot paladin a bit slower tho. but dont missunderstand me, i dont have problem with it coz i like tanking with paladin.</div></div><hr />
