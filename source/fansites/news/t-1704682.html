General<br />
<br />
[Hotfix in testing] Mangle's damage has increased by 27%.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raids, Dungeons, and Scenarios<br />
<br />
Blackrock Foundry<br />
<br />
Gruul<br />
<br />
Gruul now uses Petrifying Slam against 5 targets in a 10-player raid, scaling up to 10 targets in a 30-player raid (used to be 8 targets for all raid sizes).<br />
<br />
<br />
Hans'gar &amp; Franzok<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue that could cause Beastlord Darmac to despawn immediately once defeated.<br />
Mages should no longer be able to incorrectly Blink through the ramp at the end of the room.<br />
<br />
<br />
Beastlord Darmac<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue that could cause Beastlord Darmac despawn immediately once defeated.<br />
<br />
<br />
Operator Thogar<br />
<br />
Operator Thogar should now be immune to damage during the start of the encounter until he jumps down onto the tracks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Iron Maidens<br />
<br />
Admiral Gar'an should no longer interrupt herself while using Deploy Turret.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blackhand<br />
<br />
Players should no longer be able to avoid Incendiary Shot on the balconies in Stage Two.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blackrock Foundry: Clarification/Known Issues<br />
Over the course of Blackrock Foundry’s testing, we’ve made a handful of changes to encounter mechanics that are not currently being communicated in the Dungeon Journal. The Dungeon Journal will be updated with those changes in Patch 6.1, which is currently on the PTR, but we'd like to share those changes to minimize confusion.<br />
<br />
Changes to the encounters that are already live, but not in the Dungeon Journal:<br />
<br />
On The Blast Furnace encounter, Slag Pool is used on all difficulties; but the journal currently incorrectly suggests that it is Mythic only. In 6.1 the journal will accurately reflect that Slag Pool affects the Heart of the Mountain during Phase 2. Hans’gar and Franzok’s Crippling Suplex ability no longer deals damage based on maximum health of the tank who was picked up. It deals a flat amount of Physical damage to both tanks who are thrown together. (663,500 damage on Raid Finder, 862,550 damage on Normal, 1,127,950 damage on Heroic, and 1,327,000 damage on Mythic) Gruul will instantly regain 50 Rage if his Inferno Slice fails to hit at least 4 targets on Mythic difficulty. Blackhand will regain energy after using Massive Shattering Smash if it fails to hit at least 4 targets. <br />
<br />
<br />
Known issues that will be fixed in Patch 6.1:<br />
<br />
When grabbed by Hans’gar or Franzok in advance of Crippling Suplex, tanks are currently unable to use abilities. They will be able to use abilities while grabbed in 6.1. Flamebender Ka’graz’s Singe debuff currently appears as a dispellable magic debuff on unit frames. It is not intended to be dispellable; this display issue will be fixed in 6.1.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Added an additional note for Slag Pool during The Blast Furnace encounter.<br />
<br />
<br />

Transmog Guidelines<br />
For some reason Blizzard has a firm stance on what we can and cannot transmog.<br />
We just want there to be some kind of order to how characters in the game look. Even with the current restrictions you can do some pretty crazy stuff, but that doesn't mean it should necessarily be anything goes. And it's a big new(ish) system with potentially far reaching consequences if we're not careful. At least to start. We've pretty frequently made changes to the rules to allow more transmog options, and that's likely to continue. Over a slightly longer term we think there should be a more defined system around transmog, with more defined paths of gameplay to specific options and looks. It's not news it's something we've been working on, and we're continuing to work on it. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/360654-my-big-protest-to-blizzard/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16201250858?page=2#39))<br />
<br />
Inappropriate use of Swapblaster<br />
Can't you just use the item that makes you immune for 12 hours? It costs like 40 silver on the AH.<br />
In upcoming Patch 6.1, Neural Silencer (http://www.wowdb.com/items/109599-neural-silencer) will also make players immune to the effects of Swapblaster (http://www.wowdb.com/items/111820-swapblaster).

<br />
Tarren Mill vs Southshore and Hogs<br />
It's old data. The &quot;Hogs&quot; mini-Hogger pet is not a reward from that achievement, and we'll correct it in the next PTR build. We haven't determined yet if/when he'll be obtainable, or from what source.

and not to be obtuse, I can't find any mention of Strength = Parry in the game anywhere. How would one know this?<br />
We covered a lot of the changes back in October, 2014: http://t.co/WCAwNw6Lwv Great info here that should help clarify. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/558682371927461889))<br />
<br />
How come Mind Control still randomly DC's the Priest sometimes? Is it something that just can't be fixed or is there more to it? This bug has been in the game for several years now and it has been pointed out numerous times if I recall correctly.<br />
Difficult to reproduce internally on one of the most complex spells in the game. Tried to fix multiple times. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/558698565925486592))<br />

versatility do not affecting recuperate healing right now. is this a bug or intended behavior? #bugs<br />
This is intended. Heals based on % health do not benefit from effects that increase healing, including Versatility. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/558443115594252288))<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt; the Venom Rush talent. Would you please clarify how Combat is intended to use this talent on boss mobs?<br />
Not needed. Instant Poison already counts for Venom Rush. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/558801184002031616))<br />
Does this &quot;hidden&quot; poisoned debuff last as long as other poisons do? (12 secs). I noticed on twin ogrons while not using &gt;&gt;<br />
Same duration, yep. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/558808333956571136))<br />

ty for patch notes - what about chaos bolt doing chaos dmg for 6.1 yes?<br />
can I ask, why are you guys on this chaos bolt doing chaos dmg campaign? What do you think will be gained? (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/558836994348810240))<br />
firstly flavour. Chaos as a dmg type exists, CB should do it. Secondly, chaos dmg interacts differently with certain...<br />
Chaos damage just counteds the target's lowest resist. Nobody has any resist since Mists, so no gain. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/558951502094409729))<br />
Additionally, getting interrupted while casting a Chaos school spell will lock out *all* schools. It'd be a nerf. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/558951637113245697))<br />
the lockout thing is worth the pierce, but raises another issue. So hard to cast, diff interr. behaviour maybe?<br />
What pierce? There's nothing to pierce anymore. Hasn't been since Mists. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/559091170479833088))<br />

PvP<br />
Hi! Is WoD Season1 going to end with 6.1 or there is no link between these two &quot;events&quot;? (or &quot;dunno yet&quot; ? )<br />
Season 1 does not end with Patch 6.1. Keep an eye on our website for the official announcement! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/558443401977151489))<br />
<br />
In 6.1, will you allow guild raid groups of 40 to queue into Ashran with the new changes?<br />
Yes. If a member of your raid queues for Ashran, all other members of that raid will queue up for the same Ashran. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/558449744226160641))<br />
<br />
by far the worse experience when gearing up alts for pvp... Grinding honor in questing gear... It's 2015...any changes maybe?<br />
sorry i disagree. We boost your ilevel to 650, drop 660 gear like rain and are super generous with honor. Never been easier. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/558681476972048384))<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
Short question to garrison raid missions. Can you get both a BRF and HM mission or will there only be one at a time?<br />
You will have a chance to get both at the same time. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/558441325532413952))<br />
<br />
Will there be a way to trade in follower 615 tokens for other tokens? Even if just 3 point upgrade tokens?<br />
No plans for that at the moment, but we definitely appreciate the suggestion. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/558441599865065473))<br />
<br />
why do monks get a salvage yard transmog they cant actually transmog...whats the point?<br />
The items are invisible and we don’t allow transmog to invisible items at this time. We included them for completeness. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/558445648836444161))<br />
<br />
Concerning: Class Xmog sets from Salvage. Why bother adding them to the game at all if some parts can't be xmogged? (Esp monk)<br />

<br />
Misc<br />
Any word on broken Ashran achieves and the Sea Calf pet bug? It's been months, and have asked numerous times to no avail.<br />
These are both being investigated and we hope to have them addressed in Patch 6.1. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/558444626072186880))<br />

We also had a Rogue shadowstep on Hanz and Franz when one went off the conveyor belt, thus bugging the encounter and resetting it. Things like this have been mentioned, but not fixed before live. BRF could potentially be a good raid, if they'd take out the bugs and scale the raid properly, but the fact there are changes made where nobody has had any info on, it amazes me people still want to raid that place.</div></div><hr />

IMO I'd much rather have conflicting information or stuff thats not for the public to know even from devs who you have to wonder if they even know what game they're working on...cho'gal not a major lore character..gets me every time.</div></div><hr />

Every time Holinka responds, I want to punch him. He just does not have any communication skills at all, and he's arrogant. People are asking legit questions, and he tries to make it sound like the person is an idiot for asking.<br />
<br />
They need to bring back whoever was in charge of PvP before they hired him, he's single handedly ruining that part of the game.<br />

Putting &quot;completeness&quot; ahead of player's using an item is a horrible, horrible design decision. That's a complete waste of dev and art time. It's decisions like this that make me wonder what the hell is going on in Irvine. One of the class defining spells of the priest class is broken, but hey, we have a complete set of armor that has several pieces that serve absolutely no purpose in the game at all. <br />
<br />
I really wonder if the guys who designed and coded things like Mind Control and Chaos Bolt and the Monk Class quit or were laid off, and everyone is terrified to touch it, or the code base is a tangled mess that falls apart if you look at it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
please name 1 instance, besides tuning changes etc, that any major or significant content was added after a PTR for a Patch has been in testing and about to be released in about a month...<br />
<br />
PLEASE..that's such a invalid comment I'm amazed you wasted energy posting it</div></div><hr />

Personally, the person who asked that question was out of line for whining about something like that. PvP is arguably the easiest way to gear up alts for PvP AND PvE. Gear literally just lands in your bag without having to do anything. If you just happen to be on a good team, piece of gear. If you jump into a winning group thats almost finished, piece of gear. Wreck 2s for like... 10 matches, piece of gear. It's never been easier to get gear for alts.</div></div><hr />
