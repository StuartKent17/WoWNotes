Blade's Edge Arena Update<br />
Patch 7.1 is updating Nagrand Arena and it looks like a future patch will update Blade's Edge Arena! This is just an update to the visuals, leaving gameplay the same.<br />

World Bosses<br />
When Isle of Watchers was first made, we populated it with temp-named elite NPCs to see what would look good living there (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/783328183328190464))<br />
The withered NPC was, of course, Withered Jim. Maybe 10 of them were spawned in a clump (again, very temp) outside of the entrance to VotW (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/783328426258079744))<br />
We started seeing data, in beta, that Jim was one of the deadliest NPCs, killing thousands of players (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/783328680491659265))<br />
Players exiting the dungeon, or players entering it for the quest, no one could escape the wrath of 10 Jims with massive damage mods (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/783328844220502016))<br />
I'm so glad he lives on, one of the wackier world bosses the encounter guys have made (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/783329007550902272))<br />
... Yeah, no offense, but the fight wasn't very enjoyable. Two of my friends are downright angry.<br />
many hotfixes are going in! handling it! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/783438821459243010))<br />
<br />
BlizzCon<br />
Doing a panel at Blizzcon this year Design retrospective on pre-launch, Broken Shore, WQs and the future. Anything you want answered? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/783440259153403904))<br />
And what warrants faster deployment of a hotfix. Like &quot;o shi yeah this is broken, fix it ASAP&quot; compared to &quot;that can wait a bit&quot;<br />
Withered J'im has had 3-5 hotfixes today (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/783442420541247488))<br />
<br />
Totes this. Events that bring the realm(s) together are awesome.<br />
.100 players flying out to defend Azeroth from Demons was perhaps the most best thing ever. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/783443149100244992))<br />

Build of the Month<br />
Each month or so we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
All of the parts on this page are Amazon affiliate links. When you purchase your parts through them it helps support the site!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
The current SSD prices (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/october/ssdgraph.gif) are fairly flat right now, with most SSDs under $0.50 per gigabyte when on sale.<br />
<br />
Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D15 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L7UZMAK?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00L7UZMAK). <br />
<br />
Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or streaming, you do not need the 6700K and should spend that money elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date.<br />

Doubt it. Didn't they add new flying mounts to the store during WoD well before they even announced you could fly in the last patch after doing pathfinder? I think but am not sure....</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you haven't noticed, Legion shipped with Hippogryff mounts.<br />
<br />
Which can fly.<br />
<br />
They can add flying mounts even if Broken Isles flying is still far off.</div></div><hr />

I played Elemental on the beta. Control of Lava gives you some of the highest burst in the game, and Swelling Waves gives you THE highest off healing of any caster. On top of having more utility and mobility than Elemental ever had. The only problem I can see Elemental having is their lack of consistent damage, but they already have just about everything else.<br />
<br />
I stand by my previous statement. L2P</div></div><hr />

However, I keep on falling over the sound suggestions. Not for the Puppy &amp; Dolphin range, rather for the Narwhal &amp; Unicorn setups. You are spending $1100-$1400 on a system with mediocre sound. I believe if you can justify to spend over $400 on a screen, you should also think about spending some money on a nice sound setup. <br />
Think along the lines of $80-100 per speaker and $150-200 for a subwoofer should you want one. The before and after will be a huge difference and immersion while playing games will go the a whole new level. Another plus is that a good sound system can last for a long time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I gave up on trying to argue the point with these Builds of the month, why? They are put together in a hurry, a lot of parts are very questionable as well as the advice. i7 are fine for gaming, if you're a power user it's highly suggested and it's been proven time and time again you don't need to render videos etc to get a use out of a i7. Also why would anyone buy an AMD FX-6300 CPU when the i3's are a lot better for the price, also the i5-6500 is a better CPU than the AMD FX-8350.<br />
<br />
I hope no one takes these builds too seriously.</div></div><hr />

If they are &quot;smart&quot; this mount will be gated behind a &quot;Legion Glory of Karazhan&quot; achiv.<br />

The garbage pvpers tears are really delicious, for the first time in 12years wow has a slighty sparkle of &quot;balance&quot; in pvp and yet the tardlord of mmo c are whining because &quot;too much cc or too much dmg or too much burst or too much imma a gargabe player lets go on mmo c whining&quot;<br />
<br />
This game will never be 100% balanced on every fucking spec for pvp so play the FOTM or go shut the fuck up or play LoL and try to play 1vs9 if you are so skilled.</div></div><hr />

You summed up my thoughts nicely. They never learn. Shiney new content is nice but fixing bugs and balancing should be a priority. PVP is in a terrible state at the moment.</div></div><hr />

New mount idea sounds, kinda of &quot;meh&quot; at this point, when it's uncertain if game is even playable half a year from now.<br />
WoW has different teams doing different things. An artist does art, so if animations or textures are not broken, he/she will spent time on creating new art, i.E. a new mount. There is no point in giving bugfix tasks to an artist, because he just doesn't know how to code.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This game will never be 100% balanced on every fucking spec for pvp so play the FOTM or go shut the fuck up or play LoL and try to play 1vs9 if you are so skilled.<br />
<br />
Plus, no one gives a shit about arena. Who gives a fuck if you are better than 3 random jabroni's? If you can't be legit in a massive 40v40 or 200 v 200, you really have no place in my army.</div></div><hr />

You can buy my imaginary invisible parrot mount. It too has different development team, what i have not imagined yet - so it's ok, for you (usability and if others can also see it, isn't critera, then it should be ok)?</div></div><hr />

Control of Lava gives you some of the highest burst in the game, and Swelling Waves gives you THE highest off healing of any caster. On top of having more utility and mobility than Elemental ever had. The only problem I can see Elemental having is their lack of consistent damage, but they already have just about everything else.<br />
<br />
I stand by my previous statement. L2P<br />

on beta, lol basically my friend of a friend told me, cool story bro but any melee is going to kill you before you cast shit.</div></div><hr />

Someday you have to explain me, why the Narwhal Keyboard is more expensive than the Unicorn Keyboard and why this Narwhal choice even exists if this is no unintended swap.<br />
<br />
Usually they are closer in price. At that point it is just a matter of which one has the features you want really. Not so much that one is vastly better than the other.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Dolphin build is just plain silly. You're spending $20 less on a motherboard to pair with a junk CPU? Buy a regular 6600 and a cheaper motherboard and enjoy way better performance.<br />
<br />
I would honestly feel like a piece of garbage if it was my job to try and force people into poor builds for the sake of making more money for Curse.</div></div><hr />

Lol every time I see these builds I shake my head. I'm sorry but there are always better options to get the most for your money. Dare I link Pcpartpicker.com? Sales change every day. If you're going to buy hardware check that site first and get the most for your money. Also people should be reading hardware reviews if theyre going to be spending a thousand dollars on a setup. Know what you're getting and how it compares to competitors so you can maximize your investment.<br />
<br />
Edit: Also, I come here for WoW news. Not hardware suggestions. If I'm upgrading hardware I'll google X hardware vs Z Hardware and theres my answer. People go to Tomshardware for that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My current build beats the crap out of the dolphin build and I spent around the same (500gb ssd, 16gb ram, r9 390x, i5 6600k, 750w psu). It is similar performance wise to the Narwhal build, but I spend around $400-500 less.<br />

You save hundreds by seeking out deals and not buying the first thing you see off of amazon.<br />

Gotta be more specific about your budget.<br />
<br />
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015PYYDMQ?redirect=true&amp;pldnSite=1&amp;th=1 is a very solid price point. I've heard you can get as low as 500 if you get it from dell refurbished.</div></div><hr />

You think you're being funny, but a mount is handled by different people than the PvP balance team. Hard to wrap your head around, that people in a company are hired for different jobs.</div></div><hr />

The purple drunken haze, the camera movement, the purple room with purple swirls with purple bolts, the whole thing just gave me a headache. I couldn't focus on the screen at all, I didn't even realize there were copies of him till I asked my friends how he went from 20% to like 70% in the amount of time it took me to run back to my corpse, turns out I was targeting a copy. Didn't matter, I died again because I couldn't see where to move away from things. There is little contrast, and the visual is just headache inducing (if not worse for those with other vision/neurological problems). I got credit for killing the boss, as in I got loot (well gold, and I got gold on my coin), but I did not get credit for the WQ and the boatload of AP because I was dead. It was not worth me even trying to go back and kill again, the AP wasn't worth the pounding headache. With so many world bosses this time around, its going to be a while before he's up again, so I won't have to worry about it. But his next cycle, I'm just going to skip him.</div></div><hr />

Have to explain every sentence, i wish people would think more - mount is not handled by different people, same people decide if it's in game, who decided, if nomi should burn it's food - it's not technical or art issue, it's game design as whole. I do not do Pvp (at least actively), if that is broken too, then it's even more fail. <br />
Just less than 2 months ago i farmed ICC, so that maybe invincible mount drops for me - atm in current state it feels like ridiculous thing to do (chase any kind of mount), since i do not know if i play the game (in longer future), my in-game friends do it or game even exists. It just so broken atm - and not technically - bugs seem more in game design department - intended etc. Blizzard has devaluated it's own game - it's short term game now, not long character/account development.</div></div><hr />

And for one I'm happy for it. In WoD, ground mount was a pain, but the Broken Isles is (are?) tailored perfectly for ground mounts and using taxi, with the current size. When they implement flying, and we'll be able to fly through the continent in a straight line, it will feel mindnumbingly small. I mean, taking a taxi from one end to the other takes a bit over 3 minutes if I'm not mistaken. (Compare that to for example the 8 min flight from Ironforge to Aerie Peak [Hinterlands]) How long will it take on a flying mount? 1 minute 10 seconds or so? Seriously I can already see how forums will be full of &quot;omg this is way too small&quot; topics and comments when flying hits.<br />
<br />
About the Builds, well... Regardless of how good or bad those parts are, I feel like recommending a computer for WoW is pointless. It's engine is so shit it makes me want to cry. I just bought a GTX1070, DOOM, GoW4 (just to mention two fresh titles, GoW4 released today, played though he Prologue this morning) runs smooth as butter at 60 FPS in 1080p on max settings, yet WoW drops down to 40-45 in some places (like Dalaran), while the CPU and GPU loads are only at around 40%... And I've seen people having FPS drops on GTX1080(s) too, so yeah, if you mainly play WoW you'll be fine with your 4-5-6 years old PC, as you will feel the computer upgrade only on the thickness of your wallet, but not on the gaming experience.<br />
