<br />
There should be no downtime between Arena Season 1 and Arena Season 2. Arena Season 2 is planned to start the week right after Arena Season 1 ends.<br />
There are plans to update all Arena items with each new Arena season. The items for Arena Season 2 are already done and ready to go.<br />
Players will be able to save up to 5.000 Arena points at any one time, and currently we do not plan to reset these points with the start of a new Arena Season.<br />
The top 0.5% of the teams of each bracket will receive the Netherdrake epic flying mount, as well as the top Arena title. This means that the top 0.5% of the teams in the 2v2 bracket, the top 0.5% of the teams in the 3v3 bracket, and the top 0.5% of the teams in the 5v5 bracket will all receive the Netherdrake and the title.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Every player on these top teams who has played at least 20% of the total games of the team for the Arena Season will receive these rewards.<br />
<br />
There will be 4 titles total for players to earn. The highest ranked title is for the top 0.5% of the teams. The specific % needed for the remaining 3 ranks will be revealed as they become finalised.<br />
This in-game Arena Season is completely separate from the Arena Tournament. Tournament qualifiers will not receive a Netherdrake mount by default.<br />

<br />
How about a difference in iLevel, any idea what kind of upgrade we're looking at?</div></div><hr />

I had been going for the casting staff, but if it's gonna be replaced by a better one...</div></div><hr />
