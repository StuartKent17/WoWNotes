Warlords of Draenor Beta Patch Notes Update - July 22<br />
Raid Utility Balance<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter<br />
<br />
Aspect of the Fox is a new ability for all Hunters.<br />
<br />
Aspect of the Fox: Party and raid members within 40 yards take on the aspects of a fox, allowing them to move while casting all spells for 6 seconds. Only one Aspect can be active at a time. 3 minute cooldown.<br />
<br />
A minor Raid utility ability (to-be-determined) will be added for Hunters.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight <br />
Miscellaneous<br />
<br />
Conversion (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/119975) no longer has an initial tick, and now costs 15 Runic Power/second for Blood, 10 20 Runic Power/second for Frost, and 20 10 Runic Power/second for Unholy.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid<br />
Ability Consolidation and Refinement<br />
<br />
Thick Hide (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/16931) has been removed and its effects have been incorporated into Bear Form (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/5487) for Guardian Druids.<br />
<br />
Bear Form (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/5487) now increases armor by 600% 330% for all Druid specializations, and no longer increases Haste and Critical Strike from items by 50%, but instead causes Haste to reduce the global cooldown<br />
For Guardian Druids, Bear Form (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/5487) now also reduces magical damage taken by 25%, reduces physical damage taken by 12%, reduces chance to be critically hit by 6%, and reduces chance for attacks to be parried by 3%.<br />
<br />
Tiger’s Fury is now usable during Berserk (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/106952).<br />
<br />
<br />
Summary of changes to Balance:<br />
That's the basics of the new Moonkin rotation. There’s room for improvement beyond that, learning to optimally maintain both periodic damage effects while maximizing their damage with the strongest Eclipse (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/79577) effect, timing Starsurge (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/78674) to optimize the benefit of its buff, make use of Starfall (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/48505) and Hurricane (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/42231) for area damage, and taking advantage of the strengths of each side (such as Moonfire (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/8921) and Sunfire (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/93402) having significant differences now). Here are the full details of the changes.<br />
<br />
Details of changes to Balance:<br />
<br />
Eclipse (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/79577) has been redesigned.<br />
<br />
The damage of damage-over-time effects changes dynamically as Eclipse (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/79577) changes.<br />
<br />
Moonfire (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/8921) now has a base duration of 20 seconds (up from 14 seconds), but is no longer extended by Starfire (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/2912) and Starsurge (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/78674) critical strikes. Upon reaching 100 Lunar Energy, the next Moonfire (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/8921) deals 100% additional initial damage.<br />
Sunfire (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/93402) is no longer its own spell and replaces Moonfire (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/8921) on the action bar whenever Balance Energy is on the Solar side. Sunfire (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/93402) now has a base duration of 24 20 seconds (up from 14 seconds), but is no longer extended by Wrath (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/5176) and Starsurge (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/78674) critical strikes. Enemies may still suffer from both Moonfire (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/8921) and Sunfire (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/93402)’s periodic damage components simultaneously. Upon reaching 100 Solar Energy, the next Sunfire (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/93402) deals 100% additional initial damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Restoration Changes<br />
<br />
Omen of Clarity (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/113043) (Restoration) can now only be triggered by the most recently applied Lifebloom (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/94447), and now causes the next Regrowth (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/8936) to be free.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage<br />
Talent Revisions<br />
<br />
Ice Ward (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/111264) was changed to make it more competitive with the rest of its talent row. Ice Ward (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/111264) now causes the next 3 attackers (up from 1) to trigger a Frost Nova (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/122).<br />
<br />
<br />
One of the most problematic Talent rows in the game has been the Mage level-90 row. The primary theme of the row was mana, which only Arcane Mages actually cared about. Bonus damage was added in, making it functional for all Mages, but muddled in its goals. Additionally, some of them just weren't fun to play with. We've revised the row to be purely about damage, and made them have less maintenance cost. Arcane Mages will have enough mana regeneration without these Talents to perform well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mirror Image (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/55342) is now a level-90 Talent, replacing Invocation (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/114003). Mirror Image (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/55342) now inherit 100% 50% of the Mage’s Spell Power (up from 5%), last 40 seconds (up from 30 seconds), and have a 2 minutes cooldown (down from 3 minutes).<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin <br />
Ability Consolidation and Refinement<br />
There were a few mergers of passive abilities, and some tweaks to a couple of abilities.<br />
<br />
Redemption (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/7328)’s mana cost has been reduced by 95%.<br />
Selfless Healer (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/85804) no longer causes Bastion of Glory to apply to Flash Heal (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/2061).<br />
<br />
<br />
Protection Changes<br />
For Protection, we tweaked Eternal Flame (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/114163) in order to reduce its massive self-healing amount, and provide better balance between talents on that row. We also added a new passive, Shining Protector, in order to give defensive value to the new Multistrike stat. Holy Wrath (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/119072)’s damage and cooldown were also increased, and Sanctified Wrath (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/53376) changed to buff it further, in order to give Protection Paladins more burst threat and damage, while retaining its core damage-splitting identity.<br />
<br />
<br />
Holy Wrath (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/119072)’s damage has been increased by 100%, and its cooldown increased to 15 seconds (up from 9 seconds).<br />
Sanctified Wrath (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/53376) for Protection Paladins has been redesigned.<br />
<br />
Sanctified Wrath (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/53376) (Protection) now increases the damage of Holy Wrath (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/119072) by 100% and causes it to generate 1 Holy Power.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock <br />
Demonology Changes<br />
We were unsatisfied with Grimoire of Sacrifice (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/108503) for Demonology. Fundamentally, it did not fit Demonology’s theme to sacrifice their pet, full time. We had toyed with ideas where it acted as a temporary cooldown for Demonology, but have decided to replace it with a new talent, which is more theme-appropriate, and fits well against the competition in that talent row.<br />
<br />
<br />
Grimoire of Sacrifice (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/108503) is no longer available to Demonology Warlocks and has a new talent, Grimoire of Synergy in its place.<br />
<br />
Grimoire of Synergy: When the Warlock or their demon deals damage, there is a chance to trigger Demonic Synergy, granting the other one 15% increased damage for 15 seconds.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior <br />
Ability Consolidation and Refinement<br />
<br />
Thunder Clap (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/115799) now costs 15 30 Rage, and also reduces the movement speed of nearby enemies by 50% for 6 sec.<br />
Ultimatum (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/122509)’s effects have been merged into baseline Shield Slam (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/23922).<br />
<br />
<br />
Fury Changes<br />
Fury Warriors received a few additional changes. In particular, Heroic Strike (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/78) has been removed for Fury Warriors, and modified Wild Strike (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/100130) to fill the role of quick excess Rage dump. We also made a revision to the Critical Strike chance of Bloodthirst (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/23881) to make them less crit-dependant. A new glyph has been added which gives Fury Warriors a choice for a notably different playstyle. Auto attack damage had become too high, so we also moved some damage from that into Execute (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/5308) (which has been changed to deal damage based on Weapon Damage, instead of just Attack Power). In order to make sure that you’re able to spend all of your resources within each Colossus Smash (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/86346) window, we added an extension to it onto Raging Blow (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/96103). Plus, we've updated some to spell alerts to improve usability.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raging Blow (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/96103) now extends the duration of Colossus Smash (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/86346) by 2 seconds, and has a spell alert on the left and right slots.</div></div><hr />

seriously T_T wasnt the original conversion rate 10 instant and 10 per? people complained that it was useless because of how high the cost was for how low the heal is and thats why they reduced it's cost now they're ramping it up even higher than originally hell even twice of what it was?</div></div><hr />

They are doing that because it had a 100% uptime for blood, and that was massively overpowered. Runic power generation is higher than before, as far as I can tell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mine too.. i'we checked spell changes for Guardian and Fury, and nothing changed. Maybe they will hit servers one of these days.<br />
<br />
Theres also a bug with prot wars and gladiator stance, apparently if you are speced into gladiator stance, you have it active and change spec to fury/arms you will stay in gladiator stance.</div></div><hr />

Then they nerfed Sanctified Wrath to an ability that can only ever activate about 2-3 times depending on Melee Haste. (4 times being that we get to 50% Melee Haste). I have a problem with this because this was my 2nd choice after they nerfed Divine Purpose to only effect healing abilities.

<br />
Balance is currently on a good spot and ppl with whom i talked to have a positive feedback and like new balance. Its still not done yet, but &quot;core&quot; feels extremely fun. I personally dont like caster specs/classes so im sticking to feral/bearass. Feral was not changed much, it received some quality of life changes, but rotation is the same till you hit lvl 100.<br />
<br />
<br />
So more CC for mages. Thought that they were suppose to be taking out CC in the next game not add more. Way to go blizz more cc for mages like they needed more cc will be worse than druid root with 3 charges<br />
<br />
This is beta. I dont actually see those changes going live, or atleast not in the state they are now. No matter how you look at it, 3charges passive frost nova that CC EVERYTHING in 8y range with 30s cooldown is OP (and thats understatement). 100% Spell Power Mirror Images also looks far to op to go live. i mean its even now big boost in DPS, i dont dare to think how will that work with raid gear or, better yet, close to end of WoD expansion when stats go UP much higher.<br />
Pair that with Time Warp and... well you get the idea.</div></div><hr />

This pushes the priority on RB and even naturally so BT in the rotation, so WS is left out. Note! Disregarding the new CS glyph ofc.<br />
<br />
Just twiddling my thumbs till they give back HS or any off GCD attack. If not, then I think some fury warrs will take Glad spec since it has off GCD HS and plays similarly to live Fury, some will reroll and the rest will quit the game. There might be a few who will stay fury for some time, but don't expect them to go anywhere in any PVE content. And in PVP, they will get their * handed to them. Eventually they will take the same choices as the rest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because you don't. Aspects as permanent buffs are gone. They're recycling the name for a short, raid-wide buff, that's all.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Correction. The &quot;run faster&quot; aspects are still there and on a toggle. Hawk's still gone though.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, good news NEVER linger for hunters.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nooooo Aspect of the Fox sucks, don't do it Blizzard. We already had it and all hated it! This new version sucks even more. 6 seconds on a 3 minute cooldown... where could that be of any use anyway?<br />
Healers will treat us like darlings, to get our favor?<br />
And pretty much every caster will give us less rage. Besides, if you like to actually help with the group, instead of trying just to beat the DPS meter, or &quot;being a teamplayer, not just a jerk&quot;, it's a pretty cool ability, you can use in movement heavy moments.</div></div><hr />

Old Aspect of the Fox: The Hunter gains the ability to shoot while moving, permanently. (And receives focus when getting hit)<br />
New Aspect of the Fox: The Raid group gains the ability to move while casting all spells for 6 seconds.<br />
<br />
See the difference? <br />
<br />
Useful mostly for healers but for DPSers as well. Surely healers have their instant casts, but being able to cast better heals while they have to move during a fight would be even better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really. Warriors also has 25% resistance to magic, and on top of that they can mitigate magical damage with Shield Barrier. Bears have to rely on their higher health pool, more CDs and to be able to heal up after the spell has hit. It's all quite balanced.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I like aspect of the fox it seems counter intuitive of what blizzard wanted to do with classes (especially hunter) and that is to remove button bloat. Is this not essentially something else I now need to keybind? They removed hawk which less face it didn't even need to be on your hotbar to introduce another ability that we need to keybind? It doesn't make sense.</div></div><hr />

This pushes the priority on RB and even naturally so BT in the rotation, so WS is left out. Note! Disregarding the new CS glyph ofc.<br />
<br />
Just twiddling my thumbs till they give back HS or any off GCD attack. If not, then I think some fury warrs will take Glad spec since it has off GCD HS and plays similarly to live Fury, some will reroll and the rest will quit the game. There might be a few who will stay fury for some time, but don't expect them to go anywhere in any PVE content. And in PVP, they will get their * handed to them. Eventually they will take the same choices as the rest.<br />
<br />
First of all this is beta and release date is 5 months away, so no need to make assumptions like that.<br />
<br />
Ignite Weapon - 30rage, Off GCD, buffs your damage to fire, 10s buff duration. Has a great synch with Glyph of CS and rotation feels really fluent.<br />
Im not quite sure what they are trying to accomplish with RG buff to CS, and im interested whats that new glyph that they are not explaining which &quot;changes how fury plays noticeably.&quot;<br />
I guess that we will see on next build as beta is still on last patch, from june 15.<br />
Anger Management is currently broken, it looks like a good choice but im unable to test it.</div></div><hr />

It's kind of stupid to give the ability to Hunters, though - and to make it an Aspect? Have they stated whether the hunter's previous aspect will be re-applied, or will they have to do that manually? Most players use some kind of buff manager to alert them of buffs like this, but what about players who don't? It all seems more than a little ill-conceived if you ask me.</div></div><hr />

It is just a cool-down that will be a raid wide buff that doesn't replace the hunters aspect while active.<br />
<br />
The no casting on the run thing is fine, instant casts should be the only thing cast-able while on the run aside from a few cool down based spells that allow it. As it sits now in PvP especially the power some of the classes like warlocks and shaman have is too insane to allow it it to continue.</div></div><hr />

As a healer, not sure I like the idea of a buff I have no control over changing whether movement cancels spells. Sometimes you want movement to cancel a spell. Or I do anyway. Alysrazor was weird like that too, but at least I had control (and it was constant, not just 6s).</div></div><hr />

One that will sift the raid-worthy from the lazy huntards.<br />

cooldown of Aspect of the Fox seems awfully long just to let casters let off 2-3 spells on the move.<br />
<br />
Depends on frequency of need (like a phase shift) occurs. Doesnt say whether or not 2 hunters in same raid could effectively double the availability. Assume cd only affects the individual use, but could end up more like Time Warp</div></div><hr />

<br />
The way it works in beta right now is there is one button for moonfire/sunfire. During the lunar phase (beginning before you start casting, all the way through the lunar bar, stays until you hit the midpoint that moves you to the solar half of the bar), the button is moonfire. If I read this correctly, during lunar empowerment (when you're at the very end of the lunar bar), moonfire will cause 100% damage when cast, in addition to adding the dot (the dot still exists). On the solar half of the bar, the same as above exists, but for sunfire instead. Both moonfire and sunfire dots can be on a target.<br />
<br />
So basically, both spells still exist, but they now share a button and change at the time the -fire is most appropriate to use.</div></div><hr />
