Absolutely right.<br />
<br />
If they're going to go through all that effort to add flavor text to make these sound as though they are long lost weapons from some of Azeroth's greatest heroes, they'd better damn well look like something they would have used.<br />

Mithrios, in particular, is ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

I feel really bad for the Ele shamans out there, having an mp5 mace as their ultimate BiS; at least Spriests and Moonkins have a spirit staff...(lol spirit)<br />
<br />
And no, the spellpower difference on the 284 hardmode loot definitely surpasses the stats on the 271 haste/crit/dagger from lich king 10man hardmode, so don't use that as an excuse.<br />
<br />
VERY DISAPPOINTING, especially with the stealth-nerf on the procrate of Nibelung for moonkins (Valkyrs are doing about overall 1/10 the damage they did before because of less procs).</div></div><hr />

I second that. <br />
It is really, really disappointing. Even ToC had atleast one unique to the last boss item model(the glaives).<br />
So all these months, all these &quot;filler&quot; raids...to end up with LK dropping a polearm, that's a recolored version of the 10man DBS polearm/25man Princes(or was it BQL) pole...or the xbow that looks like something from PoS or FoS.<br />

Was anybody else incredibly disappointed that that Invincible music track from last week didn't end up being the background music for the cinematic (at least not intact)? I was. The good news, though? If you watch the cinematic and start playing said track at ~47 seconds or so in when the hand hits the floor (I'm being vague to avoid spoilers in case anyone reading this cares), it syncs up almost perfectly, within a second or so. At least from a musical/narrative phrasing perspective, that is--there are three distinct sections of the song and three distinct sections of the narrative in the cinematic, and when you sync them up like that not only do those sections align very closely but the musical accents accompany sufficiently dramatic shots/events.<br />
<br />
Of course, I could just be succumbing to Dark Side of the Rainbow bias here, but I still think it's pretty uncanny. Coincidence? God, I hope so, because it SHOULD'VE been like that.</div></div><hr />

I feel really bad for the Ele shamans out there, having an mp5 mace as their ultimate BiS; at least Spriests and Moonkins have a spirit staff...(lol spirit)<br />
<br />
And no, the spellpower difference on the 284 hardmode loot definitely surpasses the stats on the 271 haste/crit/dagger from lich king 10man hardmode, so don't use that as an excuse.<br />
<br />
VERY DISAPPOINTING, especially with the stealth-nerf on the procrate of Nibelung for moonkins (Valkyrs are doing about overall 1/10 the damage they did before because of less procs).<br />

Both have the same itemlevel so it doesnt make sense that a legendary does have the same or even a little less dps than an epic... ilvl200 blues have less dps than ilvl200 epics vor example.<br />

Remember all the really COOL stuff dropped from illidan, not just stat-wise, but also in Design. Remember amazing Bullwark of Azzinoth, remember the Cursed Vision of Sargeras, Black bow of the betrayer or Zhar'doom. And of course the glaives.<br />

<br />
Sure? Everyone tells blizzard how it is their most important raid boss ever made and often even the last one that makes sense (you didn't. here). It's the Lich King. It's somehow Arthas. Important, yes. Illidan was important too. YOU made such a great bond with Arthas that you think it is the most important. The Lich King is an important raid boss. The most important? Nah, probably recently, that means in WotLK.<br />
We all know it won't happen, but they still have enough time to add 25H only unique models before anyone gets them. :p<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Uhm no. Because the classes that use Shadowmourne pretty much don't care about weapon DPS but top damage (ability scaling).</div></div><hr />

I don't personally care much about Arthas, but he's an important lore figure. You could argue that Illidan and KJ are as prominent but then, all their loot was unique, wasn't it? I only played Vanilla and WotLK but people certainly still talk about how much they love the models. <br />
<br />
Even if we accept that Arthas is only important in that the encounter is the pinnacle of an expansion pack, that's still the culmination of a massive development cycle; 14 months in release and X months of development.<br />
<br />
From all accounts the fight itself is epic and the arena looks great. Can't help but think that they dropped the ball on itemization and model art.</div></div><hr />

A lot of extra work? If I can pull a guess out of my ass, it would have at most (approvals and team review time aside) taken a couple days for a talented digital artist and 3D modeler to produce.

<br />
I nearly jumped for joy when I saw the stats on Bloodsurge. Then I read on and realised it was yet another sword &gt;:(. How have the development team not learned their lesson from Quel'delar? All dps casters are crying out for haste and once again those who can't use swords are shafted, not only by the last boss but also by the itemisation of the 1H weapons in the entire 25 man instance. Infact, I'll go so far to say that any healer participating in a LK kill won't be hurting for manaregen by that point and will be gearing towards other stats as well. However we at least have options. Enough options so that the mace from the LK can be turned into a caster weapon and it wouldn't hurt us in the slightest. Infact, if anything, gives me and my holy priest (at the very least :P) another option since I'ld sooner keep my Midnight Sun from the 10 man than that monstrosity of a mace.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now, it's either a bug or Blizzard has simply forgotten that feral druids can exist.</div></div><hr />

The end boss from a storyline that started 7 years ago shouldn't be dropping loot that looks just like everything else in the instance. I mean, even Naxx had more unique weapons than this. Hell, I'd be happier if they reskinned Betrayer of Humanity; so far it has never been. The poor itemization is annoying as well, I mean the higher stat budget on the weapons make them clear upgrades over what else is available, but most are far from ideal. Hell, the only thing I think is great is the flavor text and names.<br />
<br />
It seems silly to complain about the looks of items in a game, but after devoting two years of my life (and much longer for many others) and spending $180 a year in addition to the initial cost of the game and all the expansions would lead me to believe that Blizzard ought to have the budget to create new models for what's supposed to be the culmination of one of their longest-running storylines.<br />
<br />
But hell, a single brick in Lego Universe has more polygons than an average wow character, I should have seen it coming.</div></div><hr />

Eh?As far as i know, there was no new Wintergrasp helm with 3.3.2.The only item that seems to be missing from that vendor is the Feral Druid shoulders.<br />

Created a post on the official forums and opened a ticket regarding the missing(?) &quot;Titan-Forged Spaulders of Triumph&quot; for druids but got no reply yet..</div></div><hr />

His point is quite valid, no matter his chances of seeing the loot. It's quite fubar if they expect Horde players to wield a weapon with that text on it.</div></div><hr />

I was wondering if I was the only one (probably not) that noticed the flavor text on this dagger &quot;Heaven's Fall&quot; is actually scripture from The Bible. It's Proverbs 26:28. Very interesting, Blizz.</div></div><hr />

Really, Blizz?<br />

Car Door was the most awesome thing on Illidan's loot table. Does this annoy anyone else, or is a tanking shield too niche?</div></div><hr />

Seems as if some realize they wasted some time of their life for reskinned models (=a game). Awww no showing-off in dalaran with your meaningless loot :'( And the stats are as bad as running around with a legendary healer mace that is two tiers old is. <br />
Sorry I don't get it. You cry if you don't get a legendary but then want to get rid of it as fast as possible? (okay the post I'm refering to was from someone with only a ret paladin in his sig)[/rage mode]<br />
<br />
Is it really only all about the QQ anymore when something is released? Where is the positive thinking? Just take what you get. You are like the little spoiled brats who complain and cry that they got the yellow mega-ranger for birthday when they wanted the red mega-ranger.<br />
How often does Blizzard need to repeat that they DON'T design every item as an upgrade presented by captain obvious.<br />
Imo unique weapon models would have been nice. Not neccessary but definitly nice. But then for ALL LK loot, 10 man and 25 man, heroic and normal (meaning 2 unique sets, one for 10, one for 25). And even then people would QQ that brain-afk 10-man-normal-mode-casual-noobs have the same weapons as the elite heroic-10-man-hardcores. And calling something &quot;unique&quot; is ridiculous anyway if half of dalaran runs around with it. (Yes I talk about the scenario of unique models for LK drops)<br />
<br />
<br />
1. you have to be a troll or 2. your such a blizzard fanboy/selfproclaimed hardcore raider.<br />
<br />
its simple to see everyone was waiting for something nice and really who can blame em its the end of the Xpack.its like reading a book and when you are near the end you find the author left the last 10 pages blank.....<br />
or when you rescue the princess in mario to find out the real 1 is in another castle =P<br />
The cliff hanger ending to a movie that has everyone fighting over is the main character dead or alive?<br />
w/e the case its sucks and we all need 2 release it in a form blizz wont read or care for but atleast we know some others feel the same and its not just us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sit down and think about it for a minute. <br />
<br />
Every single one of these weapons, with the possible exception of Heaven's fall is a named reference to weapons Arthas would have picked up in the course of becoming the Lich King and Crushing Lordaeron. Kel'Thuzad (human) Muradin, Terenas, Uther, Antonidas, Sylvanas<br />
<br />
<br />
Where would Arthas have picked up a Flavor text horde weapon?</div></div><hr />

I feel really bad for the Ele shamans out there, having an mp5 mace as their ultimate BiS; at least Spriests and Moonkins have a spirit staff...(lol spirit)<br />
<br />
And no, the spellpower difference on the 284 hardmode loot definitely surpasses the stats on the 271 haste/crit/dagger from lich king 10man hardmode, so don't use that as an excuse.<br />
<br />
VERY DISAPPOINTING, especially with the stealth-nerf on the procrate of Nibelung for moonkins (Valkyrs are doing about overall 1/10 the damage they did before because of less procs).<br />
<br />
<br />
This, can blizzard PLEASE just not screw over ele shamans just ONCE? Fucking unbelievable</div></div><hr />
