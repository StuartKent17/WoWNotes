Because they're adjusting/fixing the bosses for ilvl squish, not nerfing the raid.</div></div><hr />

However, Argus is still pretty tight, too tight for a prepatch. Argus needs a phase 3 nerf. Really hate wiping to DPS check after we've been farming it before prepatch..</div></div><hr />

Why remove cutting edge if the raid is not nerfed!</div></div><hr />

Your dps are pretty bad if you are having issues with the dps check.</div></div><hr />

<br />
we're finishing p2 with 8min left after prepatch, i'm having trouble understanding how anyone who &quot;farmed&quot; that boss before could be having trouble with a supposed &quot;dps check&quot;<br />

<br />
Why remove cutting edge if the raid is not nerfed!<br />
<br />
because the raid got nerfed 275 times already before prepatch. if you didnt get CE by then, they cant help you more than that. <br />
<br />
CE got taken away like mage tower challenge because they were made and balanced for classes with sets of abilities that are no longer here, with rotations that dont exist anymore. you can go to Antorus, but most Mythic fights behave differently in terms of source of damage. <br />
<br />
Also the fact that the damage are balanced enough not to os everyone, and that mob health is balanced enough you can kill boss doesnt mean the fight is the same.<br />
exemples : mines explosion (not dot) can actually oneshot people on High Command, you cant go 4-5 simultaneous adds on Aggramar anymore, Rent souls on Argus are a joke, allowing tanks to fast clear them now without being monks.<br />
<br />
the point of the dmg reductions in antorus over the past few days is not to &quot;nerf&quot; the raid or &quot;allow more player to clear 11/11M&quot;, it's to make those encounters possible without very specific comp. Varimathras was hitting tanks for 260 k shadow damage. the dot from dogs could hit for up to 65k every 2seconds, the scythe from argus was oneshotting 260 geared tanks on 3 stacks. without very specific gear, and very specific externals, some encoutners were just not doable anymore. hence why it's called &quot;Hotfix&quot;, and not &quot;Nerf&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I believe the dps check he is referring too is running out of room in the last phase.</div></div><hr />
