Noblegarden 2015<br />
Noblegarden is back once again and this year brings a few updates to the event. Check the guide on Icy Veins (http://www.icy-veins.com/wow/noblegarden-2015) for the full details!<br />
<br />
<br />
The Mystical Spring Bouquet (http://www.wowdb.com/items/116258-mystical-spring-bouquet) is a new non-combat pet that will follow you around. You can purchase it for 100 x Noblegarden Chocolate (http://www.wowdb.com/items/44791-noblegarden-chocolate).<br />
New eggs such as Magnificently-Painted Egg (http://www.wowdb.com/items/116359-magnificently-painted-egg) have been added. These allow anyone who can see them to loot an item that sells for 90% of the gold of the original, making them another way to transfer gold between realms. <br />

WoW Token Prices - Day 1<br />
WoW Tokens came out today and had a slight spike in prices in the afternoon before the price started going down. Prices were initially adjusted hourly and now appear to be adjusted every 15 minutes. For the most part, prices are changing by 1% in either direction when they do change.<br />

&lt;div id=&quot;wowtoken&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; class=&quot;pgcharts&quot;&gt;Don't see a chart? Enable javascript!&lt;/div&gt;Changes to Conquest Catch-Up Cap<br />
As of this week’s reset, we’ve made a change to how the Conquest catch-up cap is calculated that should result in a 50% increase to the catch-up portion of the cap. We’re making this change because, while we still want there to be an incentive to play early and often, the amount of Conquest that a player could earn via that catch-up cap didn’t feel like enough once the PvP season had been active for a while.<br />
<br />
To elaborate, the formula used to calculate a player’s catch-up cap is now:<br />
Number of weeks passed in the season × 1500 - Total amount of Conquest earned this season<br />
<br />
That number is then added to the weekly total cap of 1700. Note that, as of this post, Warlords Season 1 has been active for 18 weeks, which means the maximum possible catch-up cap for a player that has not earned any Conquest points this season is 28,700 Conquest.<br />
<br />
We're looking into the reports that some players haven't had their catch-up cap increased. I'll update when I can.<br />

Game Mechanics Arguments<br />
Why is that? What makes mechanics in the game create feelings of injustice rather than just distaste?<br />
I think it's mostly to do with ownership. You see the same thing with some movies, especially with popular movie franchises, that the dynamic of product creator and product consumer changes--and this is compounded when you factor in age and nostalgic factors. It's not just about making something to entertain for a couple hours anymore and a 'We hope you had fun!' and everyone moves on, it's had an impact on who they are, and it's something they've invested some portion of their life toward. In most cases you'll also find these things have a human element, where relationships are formed, experiences with friends are had, and memories made. When you're involved in creating the entertainment that defines a part of who someone is, and this is especially true of games and gamers, you're not just making something they can choose to buy or not, you're continually trying to deliver on a promise. It's usually not a promise anyone wrote down, or put on a website, but it's an expectation that this piece of their life won't betray them by becoming something else. All of this is sometimes explained or downplayed as entitlement, and I think that word is often used as a way to belittle people who rightfully have expectations--who have a deep and emotional connection to a life experience that just happens to be based around a piece of entertainment.<br />
<br />
It's no small part of our job to ensure that when you see one of our game logos, or just the Blizzard logo, you know that when you pick up that box, or click on a link, it's going to be something that delivers on all those promises, and that those expectations are not only met but exceeded. It's a really difficult, and scary, and exciting, and wondrous obligation we have. And one that we really enjoy challenging ourselves with. Every day.

Art<br />
I have to ask: Will vanilla armor/weapons have HD model? It's a lot of art work but we can use them fot the next 5-10 years. <br />
Re-vamping the human/orc armor in WoD made sense for garrisons, but yeah, it's expensive, art-wise. Often rather make new stuff. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/582804032869134336))<br />

Misc<br />
Do you think ability and skill trumps the need for a college degree as a game designer, assuming you can produce very impressive<br />

Warlords of Draenor Art<br />
Today we have some of the art done for Warlords of Draenor by Vergne Fanny (http://fafart.blogspot.com/p/warlords-of-draenor.html), one of Blizzard's Senior 3D Environment Artist. There are also lots of environment shots from popular places in Draenor that she worked on.<br />

In the beginning there will be a small increase in price because of the few hyped people with lots of ingame gold to spare who thought the price would SKYROCKET. So they all bought 1 or 2 years worth of tokens in the first few hours which led to the price increase. Now all those plebs have their tokens and the market is ready for the normal demand, which is WAY smaller at 30k/token then in the first few hours. The token price will continue to drop until it reaches a point of 15-20k / each.<br />
<br />
Many people here have overestimated how many people actually have a lot of gold ingame, which are really just very few. Even if you're in a raiding guild with 30 people and everyone has 500k gold. You need to understand that that's like 30 people in a server population of 15000. And those 30 people all only need 1 token each month. There are WAY more casuals who buy those tokens for real money than people here can imagine. <br />
<br />
I'm satisfied tho that by not being able to make an educated guess many people have bought years worth of tokens overpriced.<br />

You can just buy 10 in a month, wouldn't call that &quot;buying bulks&quot;. It has nothing to do with being rich in WoW. If someone actually bought 10 of them just in one go then obviously that person can afford to buy 10 times the amount she just did. The fluctuation in its price is so low for them that this 5-10k drop is just nothing and at that stage of the game can be obtained by spending exactly 1h in AH. Well predicted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That &quot;10 a month&quot;-regulation is only applicable for the real money side. You can buy as many tokens with gold as you want to.<br />
So say there are some of the &quot;skyrocket-sayers&quot; who bought 20 tokens for 30k each. That's 600k gold. In a few days when tokens cost 15k each they'll acutally be at a deficit of 300k which just went &quot;in the trash&quot;. Hell, for many 300k is not a lot. That doesn't change the fact they could have saved those 300k by making a better guess.<br />
<br />
In other words. I feel good for the casuals who outsmarted the &quot;self-proclaimed smart&quot; by selling the tokens early. The casuals made a good profit (as in: got good gold for their 20$), when at the same time the gold-buyers thought they were smart for buying early. Warms my heart</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">huldu</div><div class="date">2015-04-08, 05:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Still a bit too early to tell what will happen. Prices might climb up once people wake up. I'm somewhat glad to see the price drop, makes it a bit easier for the more &quot;casual&quot; players to obtain them if they choose to. 30k might not seem like a lot to many of you, but it is quite a bit for the average player. When you think about heirloom upgrades, raiding, buying equipment and what not, the costs do add up. This is especially true since most people don't really like to spend hours at the auction house playing that game. But like I said, it's a wee bit too early to see how things turn out. It'll be more &quot;exact&quot; in a few months when things finally settle down.<br />
<br />
I'd be surprised to see them drop below 20k however, that's seems like a long shot, but you could be right. Even if they only sell for 15k they are guaranteed 30k right? - At least for the moment until blizzard changes the system and allows players to set the prices. Not looking good for those guys that expected to get 60k for a token, lol.</div></div><hr />

Isn't that worth like... one BoE epic? Maybe?<br />
<br />
It'll be interesting to see what the price settles at once the initial novelty wears off.<br />
<br />
I would also be really interested in seeing the volume bought/sold at different prices, since they won't match up the way they set it up</div></div><hr />

smart people &quot;gold&quot; cost averaged throughout the day...although do you really think people who bought 20 really care if they paid 600k and they dropped to 300k? Even for me, someone who did not buy even close to half of 20 tokens, 600k is about 45-50 days worth of follower missions spending about 45-60 min a day flipping gold missions on 13 100's (I track this in a spreadsheet for fun...)</div></div><hr />

In the beginning there will be a small increase in price because of the few hyped people with lots of ingame gold to spare who thought the price would SKYROCKET. So they all bought 1 or 2 years worth of tokens in the first few hours which led to the price increase. Now all those plebs have their tokens and the market is ready for the normal demand, which is WAY smaller at 30k/token then in the first few hours. The token price will continue to drop until it reaches a point of 15-20k / each.<br />
<br />
Many people here have overestimated how many people actually have a lot of gold ingame, which are really just very few. Even if you're in a raiding guild with 30 people and everyone has 500k gold. You need to understand that that's like 30 people in a server population of 15000. And those 30 people all only need 1 token each month. There are WAY more casuals who buy those tokens for real money than people here can imagine. <br />
<br />
I'm satisfied tho that by not being able to make an educated guess many people have bought years worth of tokens overpriced.<br />
<br />
edit: I'm only laughing at those with thousands of gold who thought they were smart when buying bulks of tokens in the very beginning. Shows you don't actually have to be smart or understand basic economics to be rich in wow.<br />

I have a guildie like that, he's got like 1M while actually spending it and makes 100Ks each month all the time. He was convinced it will rocket to 800K+ for the first few months because there won't be many people paying USD for tokens and all the super gold rich people will fight for these tokens. Apparently wrong.</div></div><hr />

Even if they only sell for 15k they are guaranteed 30k right? - At least for the moment until blizzard changes the system and allows players to set the prices. Not looking good for those guys that expected to get 60k for a token, lol.<br />
<br />
You're not guaranteed 30k, you're guaranteed to be paid whatever the market was at when you listed the token. So if the market is at 20k, and you list it while they're selling for 20k, then you'll get 20k for it even if it drops lower or goes higher in the time before your token actually sells.<br />
<br />
Which I think is why they aren't ever going to drop super low, because its going to reach a point where people don't want to list their tokens for low prices. 15k might be nice and affordable for a casual player, but remember that hinges on someone else paying $20 for a token and agreeing to list it and only get 15k gold in return. Every token a player buys with gold, has been bought for $20 of real money by someone else, so they're not just going to throw them away for low amounts of gold. If I went to the AH to list a token and saw the market was at 15k, I certainly wouldn't be putting one up for sale.</div></div><hr />

I like how you automatically assumed I'm poor in WoW. I have millions of gold lying around myself. That doesn't mean I have to be one of the bads burning 300k when it's crystal clear that the price of the token WON'T skyrocket. You say you'd rather burn 100k then be sorry in the end. I say I understand how the token market turns out and don't have to take the risk. You gambled and failed. <br />
<br />
Also you say the price will rise again? Your reasoning doesn't make sense at all. People like you have bought their tokens for the next X months. That means there is little to no demand for tokens at high prices (which guys like you are the only ones demanding obviously). If you think the price for a token will ever rise over 30k again you're delusional (ofc without a major gold inflation caused by a new expansion where quests give you 500 gold and greys sell for 100g).<br />
Everyone can make millions of gold by just leveling characters/doing missions and professions. You don't have to be smart to do that. You're one of those. And then there are people who do that but additionally understand/are able to predict circumstances like the price of the wow-token.</div></div><hr />

Um no, If demand is lower than supply - prices drop, not rise. If most wow millionaires stop buying tokens the price of a token will drop. Just like it did with the Guardian cub. Once most collectors had the pet the price went down quite a bit.<br />

I still think that a person who buys 1 month gametime for 20$ is an idiot. Even when he gets 40k Gold in return. Looks like WoW has a lot of people who have no idea of the real worth of real money.<br />

No-one is buying game time for $20. They are buying gold for $20.</div></div><hr />

It might be hard to understand for you but there are people who make 20$ in 30 minutes of working at their daily jobs. And yes, they'd rather use that money gained in those 30 minutes than to spend 8 hours in WoW doing stuff they'd rather not want to do. There are people who don't value money like you do.

Because not everyone is interested in logging on every day to do garrison chores. They may just want to get on to raid or pvp, and not worry about spending their time, doing, as I said, chores.

it takes me a fairly long time to get 15k in wow... . i do nothing to get gold though, hate playing the AH and have maybe one follower with the treasure hunter state on my main, 1 alt has a few more but i don't get to check him every day. I may buy one token a month but 24k is pretty low, 30k was already cutting it close for me. I have tons of uses for gold in WoW though, lots of mounts and followers i want but can't afford etc.. and if i had a bit more disposable income i'd gladly buy the tokens cause i hate trying to earn gold in a game.. that is work to me. When i play i want to play not &quot;work&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's going to go down to around 18-20k and stay in that range. That's the only price range that makes sense for both the buyer and the seller, as it keeps the $1=1k ratio for both, which is what the value has been on the &quot;black market&quot; forever.</div></div><hr />

But maybe I just fail to understand the basics of the game. You talk about chores. If all you want to do in WoW is raiding or pvp, you don't need the gold (raiding gets you more gold than you lose by repair costs/buying buff stuff) and even pvp brings you tons of gold. So, why would you buy gold?<br />
<br />
I don't pay for gold. I have way more then i'll ever know what to do with. But I can see the value in paying 20 dollars for what you say is 8 hours of garrison work.</div></div><hr />

That's what you do in a game. You play it, you earn things, you find things, the game rewards you. It's not &quot;Hey, I'm a new player and I want everything in the first month of that game&quot;.<br />
Besides, if new players in WoW are like this, they will cancel their sub after the first half year.<br />
<br />
Just because you like farming for gold doesn't mean other people like it. There are plenty of new players who have 3+ toons and not even 1 at max level yet. They see all the shiny mounts / pets and they want it. <br />
<br />
New players wanting new things is just an example I used. There are plenty more reasons why older players want gold. Farming for gold is boring. Some people might like it, most don't. Just because you like to play the game in a certain way doesn't mean everyone else wants to play it your way.<br />

The irony here is that you seem to have ignored the other side of this. There are people who have so much gold that they don't value it as much as others and are not going to be particularly wounded over the idea of losing out 120k (assuming they bought two years worth of tokens at 30k/month vs. 25k/month now).<br />

And yet, people do that. There were gold seller sites when WoW launched. There were gold seller sites 5 years ago. There are gold seller sites right now (I get 3 different sites spam at least daily). Those sites don't operate at a loss (and it does cost them to get that gold. Even maintaining hackers and scams has its costs). They are still in the business because they do sell their &quot;10k gold at 15$! 30% additional free gold today!&quot; (everyday).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, if people slow down on buying them for real money because they don't feel they're getting enough gold out of it, the gold cost of it (and thus gold payout for real money buyers) will increase until it settles somewhere stable. Supply and demand :cool:</div></div><hr />

Sure, you still can go and grind mobs for loot or farm old dungeons, but most of the gold you get is by playing the game. Even if you are not max level, you make tons of gold by leveling through dungeons, going into battlegrounds or questing. Or do you mean playing the game is boring?<br />
I made around 80k gold just leveling my toon from 85 to 100 at the start of WoD. How is that &quot;farming&quot;? <br />
<br />
as said before:<br />
Besides, if new players in WoW are like this, they will cancel their sub after the first half year. How does this benefit WoW?<br />
<br />
And it does effect everyone in WoW. If people are ok with buying gold, they will be ok with buying mounts, buying gear and buying achievements. Parts of this are already OK for most people. You now can buy gold from other players and buy endgame gear from the auction house. You can buy mounts for achievements and don't have to work for them. You can buy yourself a way into the game.<br />
How is that good for a game?<br />
I don't know what other players do, but I can never have enough gold in WoW.<br />
I already bought and sold spectral tigers and other stuff some time ago, but there is still much I would buy for gold.<br />
<br />
I stopped playing WoW, because I did not have enough gold and acquiring gold is too expensive.<br />
I don't want to work in WoW to get gold, I work &gt;40h a week.<br />
When I play WoW I want to relax and have fun.<br />
<br />
For me, fun is:<br />
Doing old raids (and being strong enough to do that).<br />
Doing current dungeons / raids solo (and being strong enough to do that).<br />
Doing some PVP without getting killed and flamed all the time (need some equip first).<br />
Buying stuff in the AH to get stronger.<br />
Buying other stuff, that is fun (mounts, pets, etc).<br />
Playing all my chars and bring the professions to max. Playing is more fun when you die less (better equip from AH or own prof).<br />
Doing the current end content. Since I cannot spend xxx hours each week, I need to buy the items from the AH.<br />
Discovering the World of Warcraft (flying around, doing some random stuff).<br />
<br />
And this is why I am playing Hearthstone and HotS now.<br />
There I can achieve more in less time.</div></div><hr />

In the beginning there will be a small increase in price because of the few hyped people with lots of ingame gold to spare who thought the price would SKYROCKET. So they all bought 1 or 2 years worth of tokens in the first few hours which led to the price increase. Now all those plebs have their tokens and the market is ready for the normal demand, which is WAY smaller at 30k/token then in the first few hours. The token price will continue to drop until it reaches a point of 15-20k / each.<br />
<br />
Many people here have overestimated how many people actually have a lot of gold ingame, which are really just very few. Even if you're in a raiding guild with 30 people and everyone has 500k gold. You need to understand that that's like 30 people in a server population of 15000. And those 30 people all only need 1 token each month. There are WAY more casuals who buy those tokens for real money than people here can imagine. <br />
<br />
I'm satisfied tho that by not being able to make an educated guess many people have bought years worth of tokens overpriced.<br />
<br />
edit: I'm only laughing at those with thousands of gold who thought they were smart when buying bulks of tokens in the very beginning. Shows you don't actually have to be smart or understand basic economics to be rich in wow.<br />
<br />
The prices won't fall for much longer, since supply will be smaller and smaller. The price is based on SUPPLY and demand. It will rise again.</div></div><hr />

I've been selling time cards consistently on wow for ages now through a private selling group on fb.. for 50-70k for 60 days.. so I'd say the price will hover around there :P (25-35k) they actually priced them fairly well. <br />
<br />
And lol at people thinking this is how it will stay forever. this is a gameplay token. you need one, you buy one. simple. if you have no irl cash.. you use gold.</div></div><hr />

You launch the game, click &quot;Reactivate Account&quot; on the character screen, and you get the choice to either buy 30 days gametime with gold, or get sent to the battle.net store to enter your credit card details.</div></div><hr />

Supply and demand. That's it. Nothing more to say. It is up to the community how much they will cost. <br />
<br />
There will be a ppint where supply meets demand and that point may vary over time. I think some people will make a lot of money by predicting the price.<br />

I dunno, first post made me laugh a little. Those with the gold to spend on the tokens bought in as early as possible because of anticipated demand and fear it was going to go up like in most every MMO that's implemented this - you want to be on the ground floor. The throttle was at 10 tokens per person, which at 30k was 300k per gold seller. As someone with millions laying around, this was hardly a dent, and there are many of us today. The adjustment, at this point 5k per token, is not that big a hit, it's 50k total. Personally, I look at 50k like the majority of players look at 5k. Just economies of scale. Sort of like when Tiger Woods wrecks a $50k automobile, I can go win one match and replace that 100 times over, so it's not a big deal to me. If you have the actual talent for making gold, you can always replace it, whereas most normal people would scream about losing it. I know I lost half a million in the lead up to the release of BRF speculating in one market, I replaced that loss 7x over so far.<br />
<br />
The tokens will eventually grow in value, right now because of throttles on purchases they are going to be artificial lows. But once everyone who actually has the gold has all the gametime they can stand, we will run out of need for the gametime, unless the game will be around for the next 20 years. That means you can expect the price to rise. Over time it will solidify to a price point, and Blizz will insure this. If you're rooting for your local millionaire to fail, I assure you that you're barking up the wrong tree. Unlike you, we have the knowledge to make it all back, whereas the buyers are essentially giving all that gold back to us. Don't worry, your overlords won't look badly on you for hating us, we are the ones in charge of this, and we have it under control.<br />

No, once people stop buying, supply exceeds demand even FURTHER.. and to promote buying, price must drop.<br />
<br />
the price then falls to a point where no one will spend $20 on it, and then price rises... eventually, (possibly already) equilibrium is found.<br />
<br />
I'm with you though... No i'm not a multi millionaire in WoW, but i've got enough gold i can easily pay for 12+ months of subscription already... except I won't, i want to leave enough that i can grow it further lol.</div></div><hr />

Prices might climb up once people wake up. I'm somewhat glad to see the price drop, makes it a bit easier for the more &quot;casual&quot; players to obtain them if they choose to. 30k might not seem like a lot to many of you, but it is quite a bit for the average player. When you think about heirloom upgrades, raiding, buying equipment and what not, the costs do add up. This is especially true since most people don't really like to spend hours at the auction house playing that game. But like I said, it's a wee bit too early to see how things turn out. It'll be more &quot;exact&quot; in a few months when things finally settle down.<br />
<br />
I'd be surprised to see them drop below 20k however, that's seems like a long shot, but you could be right. Even if they only sell for 15k they are guaranteed 30k right? - At least for the moment until blizzard changes the system and allows players to set the prices. Not looking good for those guys that expected to get 60k for a token, lol.<br />
<br />
It's only guaranteed 30k if you listed when Blizzard gave you the quote of 30k. If you were to list now, you'd get whatever the quote is NOW. Last I heard that number is around 20k. Can't find any site that has real time token updates at the moment though.</div></div><hr />

It's just blizz setting the prices, there is no way there are more tokens for sale than people who are buying them with gold. Who the hell would buy a 20usd token and sell it for 20-30k gold? People who want to buy gold already do that through private sellers, you can buy 100k gold for 30euro, 35-40if you go through the mainstream sites. They don;t even ban you for it, they ban botters/hackers who use stolen cc's. Everyone wants to buy the tokens for gametime, havent heard of many who are wanting to sell them but somehow the price keeps going down :S<br />
<br />
Only explanation would be stolen cc's mass buying tokens and selling them for gold so they can sell that for real money and launder the money that way.</div></div><hr />

If the token is aimed to a wider audience, the demand should be higher. However, the price is dropping. And a price drop of the token means the offer is higher than the demand. I don't believe people are massively buying wow tokens for selling, not when the prices keep dropping constantly (meaning their tokens are not being bought).</div></div><hr />

They do not have to. To have the price dropping it doesn't need people to buy tokens for real money...it's enough if those that want to buy tokens for gold just don't buy. Then the price will keep dropping. Those that want to buy tokens for gold would be stupid to buy now...they wait till they see that the bottom line is reached. So the current situation is likely that hardly anyone buys tokens for gold or real money...but because there are still tokens on the market and nobody buys them, the price keeps dropping.</div></div><hr />

Yea, I might be paying with cash or credit card through Blizzard, but I can buy a 3 month virtual card for $41.97, that $13.99 per month. If these tokens can get down in to where it as cheap as what I pay out with real money, then I might consider dumping a lot of gold on a year's worth or more. Right now they are just a hair above 22k, if they go down to 15k I will probably buy as many as I can at that point. I am sure not going to buy them for anymore than that.</div></div><hr />

If people could make money so easily, then there wouldn't be as many poor people either in the game or the real world. Gold may be easy for some to make, but for others, each gold they make immediately goes out of their pocket. Blizzard stated some time ago most players didn't even have 1000g. I saw not long ago a thread asking for the price of epic flying to be reduced from 5000g. So I guess the average hasn't gone up much. Clearly, despite the ability to make gold being easier than ever before, people are still struggling.<br />
<br />
I also find it funny how people state you can work an hour to get $20. I don't know about you, but I was working a barely above minimum wage job at $8.50 an hour. After taxes, I got $6.70 an hour. It'd take me nearly 4 hours to make $20 so about half my work day. You'd have to make well over $20 to make $20 an hour after taxes, and how many people work those kinds of jobs? Most jobs here in the US are service jobs which are lucky to be $16 an hour. Most are below that. People really overestimate things or just don't want to see the truth.<br />
<br />
Kind of wish I bought a token early to sell for 30k since now it's at 22k but oh well. I can wait for 6.2 where I'm sure the demand will jump.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think there is enough people that will end up buy these. The people with tons of gold surly are buying by the year or more, but after those waves have passed there is just a bunch of people that just do hardly anything or don't play enough to make enough gold to even support their repair bills. Given about a week of this and the price is going to absolutely tank. I have read in game of people buying 4 or 5 years of tokens. If there are few thousand of these types of people, then once they buy that much there is no reason to ever buy even more.<br />
<br />
Supply will have to drop like a rock for them to go up in price and once that happens there will not be that many people buying them. I think who ever is going to buy than a few months of time will have done so in the next few days. Once the initial wave passes there will be few to buy them on a constant basis.</div></div><hr />

Why is it fail?<br />
<br />
What is you definition of it being a success.<br />
<br />
My definition is &quot;if it makes Blizzard more money and gets more people playing the game&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I think the fail part atm is the price. 3rd party web sites are offering better value and IF players are looking to buy gold - they might be tempted to go for the value.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
The tokens are aimed at a wider audience than people who buy gold thru third party sites.<br />
<br />
The tokens are a legitimate gold source.<br />
<br />
The 'others' will continue to purchase thru 3rd party websites, yes, meanwhile the Tokens are aimed at a wider audience.<br />
<br />
<br />
The wider audience that might never have thought of buying gold before this was implemented are also seeing that the 3rd party sites are offering better deals. So maybe Blizzard is also creating new audience that will in the end go to 3rd party websites. Players that might never have done that before this move.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sure the next week or so will see prices stabilizing.</div></div><hr />

I don't know about you, but I was working a barely above minimum wage job at $8.50 an hour. After taxes, I got $6.70 an hour. It'd take me nearly 4 hours to make $20 so about half my work day. You'd have to make well over $20 to make $20 an hour after taxes, and how many people work those kinds of jobs? Most jobs here in the US are service jobs which are lucky to be $16 an hour. Most are below that. People really overestimate things or just don't want to see the truth.<br />
<br />
Kind of wish I bought a token early to sell for 30k since now it's at 22k but oh well. I can wait for 6.2 where I'm sure the demand will jump.<br />
<br />
seems like somebody should spend less time in virtual world and more on his irl abilities and knowledge to get better job to afford his hobbies without thinking five time before spending every 5 $ :)</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has created the norm that you can buy gold with real money.. not actually telling ppl that you don't get the gold unless the token is actually sold. Until then... you just spent 20$ and got absolutely nothing instead.<br />
<br />
When it will sell? Sometime... but looking at the current prices... it could be quite some time. And in the meantime - players expecting to have extra 30K gold... end up with 20$ less with unsold token in AH.<br />

To actually get gold right away is to go to 3rd party websites.</div></div><hr />

no they said youll get the price you put it in for no matter what the current price is like its dropped heaps after i put mine in for 30,500g but i still got 30,500</div></div><hr />

When you sell your token on the AH, you get exactly how much it says you'll get when you post it. The price it sells for is irrelevant.</div></div><hr />

Now that gold is very expensive (and might be getting even more expensive). You could actually save on WoW game time on the back of the legit buyers if gold sellers undercut blizzard with this bubble.<br />
<br />
Edit: Just went to a gold seller site 40,000 gold for $25. So you'd save $4 dollars on gametime. Blizzard needs to address this.</div></div><hr />

It takes longer to grind my garrison. I believe that the price of the coins will ultimately be what ever blizz wants it to be. Its guaranteed after all. They can adjust the economy based on drops or just buy it out. Its a game a couple of keystrokes and everyone gets bought out their is no audit... Now if they base it on btc that would be interesting. I could buy anything with in game currency. Only time will tell if people will trust it</div></div><hr />

they know that - they are saying that they dont GET any gold UNLESS another player gives them gold for it, blizzard just gives them a token for 20bucks and says GOOD LUCK!</div></div><hr />

Guess cause it was close to the 20k line. Such lines work as a trigger. A lot said they would buy at 20k on the forums. So when it came close to 20k people may have started buying cause they have been afraid that the price will raise soon. We'll see how long that will last and if it will be the same as on the first day with the 30k line.<br />
<br />
Wouldn't surprise me if buyers of tokens for real money won't buy anymore cause they want to see how high the price rises...while the gold buyers want to buy now as long as it's cheap. So we may actually see it go up all the way to 30k before it goes down to 20k again...;-)</div></div><hr />

I'm kind of expecting that to happen now. Right now there are none available for 20.7k. Once it gets back up to upper 26-30k people will post more tokens, then it will fall back down to 20-22k and people will buy them all. Then the cycle repeats. Buyers only willing to pay ~21k, but sellers only wanting to get 27-30k, with each auction another 6-10k will appear out of thin air.</div></div><hr />

Us? Na we're not bored, we're talking about the topic this thread was meant to discuss. You on the other hand, came here to complain about it. If anyone is bored, it must be you. <br />

To have the price dropping it doesn't need people to buy tokens for real money...it's enough if those that want to buy tokens for gold just don't buy. Then the price will keep dropping. Those that want to buy tokens for gold would be stupid to buy now...they wait till they see that the bottom line is reached. So the current situation is likely that hardly anyone buys tokens for gold or real money...but because there are still tokens on the market and nobody buys them, the price keeps dropping.<br />
<br />
You're just saying the same thing I said. Offer &gt;&gt;&gt; demand due to very low demand. If you said people started buying tokens non-stop, that would be a different thing (we're saying there is almost no demand, and by saying people bought tons of tokens we would mean a huge offer, which ends up being the same but on a different basis Offer &gt;&gt;&gt; demand due to offer excess).</div></div><hr />
