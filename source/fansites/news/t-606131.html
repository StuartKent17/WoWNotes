Hyjal summit and Zul'aman changes in 2.4<br />
I already posted about the additions of The Fists of Fury (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/thefistsoffury.jpg) to the Hyjal Summit trash loot table yesterday, but we now have a lot more details about all the changes made to Hyjal Summit in 2.4<br />
You now get 12 reputation points for each mob killed.<br />
Frostwyrms give 60 reputation points.<br />
Bosses give 375 reputation points.<br />
You should get about 6~7k reputation points for a single run. <br />
The area around Archimonde in Battle for Mount Hyjal has been decreased in size and players are no longer able to go into the hills around his area. (Source (http://www.wowwiki.com/Patch_2.4.0/Undocumented_changes))<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, I didn't really know where to add this Zul'aman change in today's news, but it looks like [item=33421] now gives 40 defense rating instead of 40 block rating. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sunwell Heroic rewards ETA - About a month<br />
Blizzard expects most of the servers to reach the 3rd phase of the Offensive within a month, at this point the &quot;Anvil&quot; will be taken and the new badge vendor will become available.<br />
While it's going to differ for each realm we expect it to take about a month for the the &quot;Anvil&quot; to be taken, and the new badge vendor that accompanies it to become available.<br />
<br />
Participating in all of the Shattered Sun Offensive-related daily quests contribute to your realm's progress in taking back each section of the island. So lend a hand! Only you can prevent Fel-Infestion! Give a hoot, don't ... avoid doing the daily quests. Where's the Anvil! How many daily quests does it take to get to the center of Quel'Danas? etc. etc.<br />

2008 Arena Tournament Registration is now open<br />
In preparation for the start of the 2008 World of Warcraft Arena Tournament, registration is now open. The Arena Tournament focuses on 3-vs.-3 Arena competition, and participants will be given the chance to qualify for live tournaments with cash prizes. By registering, you will be granted access to our special tournament realms where you can customize your characters and battle with fellow players. For more details or to register for the tournament, please visit the Arena Tournament information page. Good luck!<br />
<br />
US Registration - http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/pvp/tournament/index.xml (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/pvp/tournament/index.xml)<br />
EU Registration - http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/basics/arena/tournament/index.xml (http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/basics/arena/tournament/index.xml)<br />
Drysc also posted a 2nd post to explain some of the &quot;rules&quot; of the tournament.<br />
We're collecting feedback and questions regarding the Arena Tournament realm and registration process, and we'll be providing a FAQ in the coming days that should address most of the larger questions.<br />
<br />
In the mean time we've prepared clarification for the rules specific to our Canadian players, the essay, and what's required to register:<br />
<br />
Canadian residents are not required to pay an Entry Fee in order to enter. Instead, Canadian residents have a choice of entering the Tournament by either submitting a 250 word typewritten essay or paying the $20.00 entry fee (per qualification round). If a Canadian resident chooses to write the essay to enter the Tournament, the essay shall be a typewritten essay on 8 ½ x 11 inch paper comparing the video gaming culture in Canada to the video gaming culture in the United States. The essay should be mailed to the following address: The North American Blizzard Entertainment Arena Tournament, P.O Box 18979, Irvine, CA 92623. Essay entries must be received no later than March 31, 2008 in order to be eligible, and should include the name, address, and the account name of the World of Warcraft account that they intend to use for the Tournament. The account specified must be an active retail Burning Crusade account, and must be registered and played from Canada (excluding Quebec). Essay entrants represent and warrant that the essay is their original work and does not infringe the rights of any third party. By entering, essay entrants hereby grant, without further consideration, all right, title and interest in and to their essay to Sponsor. No corrections or adjustments to the entry materials will be accepted either during or after the signup period.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sunwell Isle offensive phase auto-completion time<br />
So ... How much time will it take to complete the offensive on a low populated realm ? not that much according to Drysc.<br />
Each phase includes an &quot;auto complete&quot; time, in which case the next phase will automatically begin if your realm is falling behind. It's around double the amount of time for it to auto complete as compared to what we estimate an average realm will finish each phase in.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hotfixes for the Week of March 24 - 30<br />
Two hotfixes have been deployed on live servers, according to the thread there will probably be more of them during the week.<br />
This thread will remain updated throughout the week of March 24 - March 30 with any notable hotfixes.<br />
<br />
Hotfixes applied and active :<br />
Players are no longer able to accept the quests &quot;Blood for Blood&quot; and &quot;Blast the Gateway&quot; without first completing &quot;The Missing Magistrix&quot;<br />
Felblood Initiate respawn rate significantly increased<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Weapon size changes in 2.4<br />
Changes on Humans, Taurens, and Dwarves are intended, but the ones on Undead and Trolls are just bugs and will be fixed.<br />
Tauren 2 Handed weapons, Female human and Male Dwarf 1 handed weapons are all intended changes. As I have said before If you do not like it please post in the general or suggestions forum. Posting here will do you no good.<br />
<br />
Undead and Troll weapons are bugs and will be fixed in a future patch.<br />
<br />
<br />
High latency in Battlegrounds<br />
Blizzard is aware of the high latency experienced by users on both EU and US realms and is working on a fix.<br />
We are aware of the high latency being experienced in some battlegroups and we're in the process of attempting to find a resolution as quickly as possible. We will continue to track this issue and report any updates within this thread.<br />
<br />
<br />
Combat Log Spam and performance issues<br />
If you're experiencing framerate issues when zonning, you might want to try this.<br />
How to stop framerate lag due to refiltering when you zone:<br />
<br />
Issue: When you zone from an instance to the outside world, the combat log goes through a massive loop, pasting every combat log message in the last 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
Why would I want to do this fix?<br />
You have framerate issues when zoning<br />
You have recently been in a combat sessions where there are many combat log events (e.g. raid boss encounters)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Instructions<br />
1. Select the “Everything” tab<br />
2. /script Blizzard_CombatLog_CurrentSettings.settings.showHistory = false<br />
<br />
This will prevent all combat log messages from being re-filtered when you zone.<br />
<br />
Side-Effects<br />
This will also prevent you from seeing old messages with the “Everything” tab.<br />
<br />
How to Undo<br />
If you accidentally set this on the wrong tab, select the broken tab and type:<br />
/script Blizzard_CombatLog_CurrentSettings.settings.showHistory = true<br />
<br />
These settings will be saved when you logout. <br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 2.4 Bugs<br />
There are a few more bugs identified on patch 2.4, according to Hortus a full list of bugs currently affecting the live servers will be released very soon. <br />
Raid reset timer<br />
There's an issue that's causing the &quot;raid reset time&quot; message to display incorrect lengths. There haven't been any changes, it's simply a display issue. I'm not sure at this time if it's an ongoing issue or if it was a temporary error. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=5575607675&amp;postId=55751959087&amp;sid=1#16))<br />
<br />
Void Reaver<br />
Void Reaver intentionally no longer targets or faces players that he casts Arcane Orb on. This was done to fix a bug. There is a bug in that there is currently no combat log message for him casting Arcane Orb (just the impact message), causing boss mods to not work. This will be fixed in a future patch.

<br />
<br />
1 month before the badge vendor is operable. Not the next phase.<br />
<br />
The badge vendor only spawns after the 2nd phase is completed and then requires a daily of her own to get operabled. So practically it will only work at the end of phase 3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, on the US-PVE PTR at least, the unlocking of the vendors went MUCH much faster than the unlocking of the buildings. I'm not sure if this was because people weren't doing the building dalies cause it wasn't live, or if it was intended to be that way.... but it seemed like about the same number of people were working on unlocking both, from what I saw, so I would say the badge vendor is probably phase 2.5, with the harbor as 3.0 and the gem vendor as 3.5</div></div><hr />

<br />
What? the armory is phase 3? as in, having the armory unlocked is phase three? I guess we're talking about phases in different ways then. I was talking about phases as the run up to unlocking the things, IE unlocking the sanctum=phase 1, unlocking the armory=phase 2, etc etc. Maybe I'm just crazy for thinking that way?</div></div><hr />

we didn't see any of them last night, although we were all hoping for them so we could stand around in IF looking funny :P TBH, they're not that great except for looks, although I guess their very good for Enh shamans or something?

<br />
And after the armor is unlocked what phase is it then? Not 2 but 3! Because the armory is then unlocked!<br />
<br />
And *after* that while we unlock the next building (phase 3) we need to unlock the shop of the smith, too.</div></div><hr />
