Freya<br />
Boss info<br />
Health - 1,394,500 (Normal) / 4,183,000 (Heroic)<br />
Mana - 234,190 (Normal) / ? (Heroic)<br />
<br />
The fight takes place in a lush, oasis like valley inside Ulduar. There are three Elder boss-tree mobs you can choose to kill or not, appearantly they are similiar to Sartharion's hard mode if you choose not to kill them the fight gets considerably harder as each elder buffs Freya and her adds.<br />
Elder Brightleaf - The essence of Elder Brightleaf increases Magic damage dealt by Freya and her Allies of Nature by 50%. <br />
Elder Ironbranch - The essence of Elder Stonebark increases physical damage dealt by Freya by 50%. <br />
Elder Stonebark - The essence of Elder Ironbranch increases Physical damage dealt by Allies of Nature by 50%. <br />
<br />
As you engage Freya, she will spawn multiple adds and start healing herself. She starts the fight with 150 stacks of a buff increasing healing on her by 4% (=600% at the beginning of the fight), a stack is removed everytime one of the add she spawns is killed. <br />
<br />
Abilities<br />
Freya 4,183,000HP (25-Man) / 1,394,500HP (10-Man)<br />
Nature's Fury - Infects an enemy for 10 sec, causing it to inflict 4625 to 5375 Nature damage to its nearby allies every 1 sec. (10-Man: 2035 to 2365 damage)<br />
Sunbeam -- Inflicts 10638 to 12362 Nature damage to enemies within 8 yards of the target. 1.5 cast. (10-Man: 7863 to 9137 damage)<br />
Touch of Eonar -- The presence of the Lifebinder heals Freya for 24000 health every 1 sec. (10-Man: 6000 health every 1 sec.)<br />
Attuned to Nature (x150) - Increases healing received by 4%.<br />
Photosynthesis -- The rays of the sun heals the plant life for 10000 damage every 1 sec. (These will spawn during the fight, make sure you kite the adds out of them to prevent them from healing)<br />
<br />
During the fight she will also spawns 3 extra adds at the same time (Storm Lasher, Stone Lasher, Ancient Water Elemental), they have roughly 1M HP each and you have to kill them all 3 at the same time, otherwise they will just revive. Killing one of these adds will remove 10 stacks of healing from Freya. <br />
<br />
She will also spawn a bigger add at some point, an Ancient Protector with 1,9M HP. Just off-tank him and kill him to remove 25 stacks from Freya. He also uses Conservator's Grip to silence members of the raid, stay under the Healthy Mushrooms in the zone to remove this debuff.<br />
Conservator's Grip -- The grip of the Protector prevents attacking and casting spells.<br />
<br />
When Freya finally runs out of &quot;Attuned to Nature&quot; stacks, just start DPSing her while you keep killing the tree adds she spawns (they will heal her for 15% after 10 seconds if you don't kill them). Lower her life to 0 and she will become friendly again, loot the chest next to her for tons of epic loot! <br />
<br />
Update 22:00 CET - Legacy (http://www.legacy-guild.eu/) (Mazrigos-EU), Method (http://methodwow.com/) (EU-Sylvanas), and a few other guilds just killed Freya ... <br />

Fight (List of abilities taken from the http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/february/stratsfu.jpgStratsFu Strategy Guide (http://www.stratfu.com/strats/IronCouncil))<br />
Each time you kill a member of the council, he will cast Supercharge and the remaining monsters will gain extra abilities and gain 25% damage. <br />
Supercharge (http://thottbot.com/test/s61920) - Unleashes one last burst of energy as the caster dies, increasing all allies damage by 25% and granting them an additional ability.<br />
<br />
Steelbreaker - 10M HP (Heroic) / 3M HP (Normal)<br />
Fusion Punch (http://thottbot.com/test/s63493) - An attack infused with energy that inflicts 100% weapon damage and an additional 8000 Nature damage per second. - He casts Fusion Punch on a ten second cooldown (but we saw it as late as 25 seconds.) If he is in a Rune of Power he will hit far harder, so it's vitally important that he's never standing in them.<br />
High Voltage (http://thottbot.com/test/s63498) - This is an aura that inflicts 2500 Nature damage every 3 sec. When he dies the aura disappears. <br />
Static Disruption (http://thottbot.com/test/s63494) (1 Mob Down) - Deals 7500 Nature damage to enemies in an area and increases Nature damage taken by 50% for 20 sec. (12 Yards radius)<br />
<br />
Runemaster Molgeim - 10M HP (Heroic) / 3M HP (Normal)<br />
Rune of Power (http://thottbot.com/test/s61974) - Runemaster Molgeim casts Rune of Power on a target NPC periodically -- there's a few seconds with no rune and then another appears. It will buff anyone standing in it, including a mob. <br />
Rune of Death (http://thottbot.com/test/s63490) (1 Mob Down) - Summons a Rune of Death at a random enemy target's location. This rune deals 3000 Shadow damage every half-second to anyone within 13 yards of that location. - This will be casted on a target player and inflict anyone within 13 yards of this player. <br />
Rune of Summoning (http://thottbot.com/test/s62273) (2 Mob Down) - Runemaster Moldeim gains Rune of Summoning which summons Lightning Elementals. These chase after players and appear to explode and deal damage. Their melee attack is Lightning Blast: deals 14-15.8k nature damage to everyone within 30 yards and kills the elemental in the process. <br />
<br />
Stormcaller Brundir - 10M HP (Heroic) / 3M HP (Normal)<br />
Chain Lightning (http://thottbot.com/test/s63479) - Strikes an enemy with a lightning bolt that arcs to another nearby enemy. The spell affects up to 5 targets, causing Nature damage to each. - Stormcaller Brundir casts Chain Lightning which chains through the raid. It can be interrupted, and he can have his cast time slowed (e.g. with Curse of Tongues.) <br />
Overload (http://thottbot.com/test/s63481) - He emotes &quot;PEASANT HAS CROSSED THE LINE&quot; as he cast this spell (10 seconds cast time): it's vitally important that everyone gets out of range (it deals 25000 nature damage to everyone within 30 yards.) <br />
Lightning Whirl (http://thottbot.com/test/s63483) - Spins around throwing off bolts of lightning at random enemy targets. Each bolt deals 6598 to 7402 Nature damage. Lasts 5 sec. - Stormcaller Brundir gains Lightning Whirl, which does AE lightning bolts. It's interruptable. <br />
Lightning Tendrils (http://thottbot.com/test/s63485) (Screenshot (http://www.stratfu.com/strats/Image:Lightning-tendrils.jpg)) - Tendrils of lightning shoot out of the caster's chest, lifting them into the air. These lightning tendrils deal 4000 Nature damage to all enemies around the caster every second. - Stormcaller Brundir gains Lightning Tendrils, where he launches into the area and chases after players, AE'ing everyone in his path.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thorim<br />
Health Points - 11M<br />
<br />
The fight takes place in The Clash of Thunder, an arena overwatched by Thorim himself. As you enter the arena you will see a Jormungar Behemoth (~1.2M HP) fighting a captured alliance/horde (opposing faction) team composed of 1 tank, 1 healer, and 3 damage dealers. Killing them is fairly easy, just make sure you take care of the AoE healing from the healer while fighting the NPC and try to avoid the large poison breath while fighting the Jormungar. <br />
<br />
Once the NPCs and the Jormungar are dead, a lot of constructs (melee, casters, and healers) will jump into the arena from the stands and you will have to handle them with only one part of your raid while Thorim throws Stormhammers at them. He will also randomly activates the lightning orbs surrouding the arena, they will deal strong AoE damage to anyone near as soon as they are activated: run away from them! <br />
<br />
The 2nd part of the raid will have to go through the hallway to the left of the Arena and fight its way to Thorim. This hallways is also full of constructs and will also have you deal with two mini bosses (about 5M HP each), you only have 5 minutes to reach Thorim before he goes berserk and kills your raid.<br />
<br />
When Thorim is pulled by the hallway team, he will jump into the arena and the last part of the fight will begin. He's got 11M Health Points and hits a well geared tank for 8k damage but will also use two abilities: the first one is an Unbalancing Strike (http://thottbot.com/test/s62130) reducing the defense of the tank by 200 for 15 sec (100 for 6 seconds in normal). He will also casts Lightning Charge (http://thottbot.com/test/s62279) every 15 seconds, just like with Grull this effect will stack and Thorim will deal more and more damage during the fight. (Thanks to Wraith (http://wraith-guild.net/) for the help on the description of the fight)<br />

<br />
<br />
Hodir<br />
HP - 35,699,200 (Heroic Mode)<br />
Normal melee attacks for 25k damage on a well-geared warrior<br />
8 Adds trapped in blocks of ice are around him, you can break the blocks (40,000 HP) to have them help you. They will randomly drop Toasty Fires throughout the fight. <br />
His aura called Biting Cold is using the same mechanics as Intense Cold during the fight against Keristrasza, it stacks up and damage increase over time. Moving will reset the stack. (This is also affected by the Toasty Fire, see below)<br />
Hodir casts &quot;Flash Freeze&quot; (9 seconds cast time), a spell that freezes the entire raid in blocks of ice. <br />
He will randomly spawn Icicles, they will create patch of ices on the ground as they drop. Standing on the ice when Hodir casts Flash Freeze prevents from being encased in a block of ice.<br />
You can also prevent Biting Cold and Freeze by staying next to a Toasty Fire in the room, however it will be removed by Flash Freeze. Warms nearby friendly creatures, preventing the effects of Freeze and Biting Cold, and increasing Spirit by 4. Toasty fire can be extinguished by falling ice or powerful frost magic.<br />
After Flash Freeze, Hodir will gain &quot;Frozen Blows&quot; and deal 70% reduced physical damage but each attack deals 40,000 additional frost damage. <br />

Ulduar - Screenshots Gallery<br />
A lot of people have been sending me screenshots of the empty parts of Ulduar on the PTRs. I guess there is still a lot of interest in it so I made a gallery of all the subzones currently available in Ulduar. This was made on an empty server and these zones will probably have a few extra items to fill them on live and PTR servers. (Mostly thinking about the outdoor zones here) <br />

so... if this goes live, a druid tank will have less HP and avoidance / mitigation than any other tank. <br />
yes, it is possible for a druid to stack stam and ignore other stats at this point to be a gimmick tank (basically for one encounter), and thus the need for this stupid nerf?<br />

Lifebloom is going to completely nerf Feral healing completely into the ground in PvP. We dealt with no int on our gear, and now you're going to compound it. If you want to nerf Restsos or Boomkin healing/humping in Arena, then find away to do it without completely fucking Feral heals. <br />
We only have one viable way of interrupting casters (bash has 1m cd and bear charge has 30 cd) and that's maim. Nerfing it to a piece of crap is ridiculous.<br />
And finally their attitude about Feral tanking is coming out...you guys want us to be at the back of the bus and let your main 3 be the MTS (Warrior/Pali/DK). Cutting the stam bonus in half is too much in conjunction with the armor bonus nerf (another by half). <br />
<br />
Why don't you just do what you've been slowly working towards Blizz? That's your idea that Druids should only be healers. Ferals are not the one's OP in PvP. It's you FOTM RETS and DKS.<br />

- WTF??? Blizz, all you have done is nerf rogues into the ground lately (when they were prolly the weakest melee dps to begin with) and now this?? It doesn't even make any sense, shiv isn't all that powerful, even with an ultra-fast weapon in off hand. Look, I know this is a way to bring assassination down without nerfing any of it's abilities, but don't you think for sec that Shiv is apart of other spec's rotation too???? I don't use it all that often (combat rogue) but this is gonna be yet another change that will hurt my dps. Oh, and those 'buffs' to combat, I don't see some of them even going live (I've said this before lol)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I think that's the point.<br />
<br />
No one let them bloom. It was a wasted effect and it caused druids to micromanage their lifebloom stacks. They wanted to make it so you had more of a choice in the matter in what you did. Right now once you get 3 stacks you would never let it drop during the fight, not it might be worthwhile to do so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is still not worthwhile to do in most cases. All letting it bloom does is give you the mana you wouldve had if it wasnt changed, and in 90% of cases it will be a huge amount of overheal since tanks usually only take damage once every 2 seconds (roughly). Then, you need to use 3 GCD's (2500 mana) to get it back to a 3 stack.</div></div><hr />

Some updates have been made to the official patch notes (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=8136495630). Below are the additions to the original notes I posted 4 days ago.<br />
<br />

<br />
Disengage: Cooldown increased by 5 sec.<br />
Viper Sting re-designed: Stings the target, draining 4% of mana over 8 sec (up to a maximum of 8% of the caster's maximum mana), and energizing the Hunter equal to 300% of the amount drained. Only one Sting per Hunter can be active on any one target. <br />
<br />
Survival<br />
Explosive Shot: Base damage lowered by 10%. Attack power scaling reduced by 12.5%. <br />
<br />

Enhancement<br />
Unleashed Rage: Reduced to 3 points, down from 5. Each point now also increases your total Expertise by 3/6/9%. <br />

Drain Soul: Each time Drain Soul deals damage to a target which can grant experience, it now has a chance to generate a Soul Shard. <br />
Soul Shard: This item now has a maximum count of 32 in inventory. <br />

Hunters in PvP<br />
Aside from the random stun of TNT and a couple of the bugs mentioned, we don't think hunters are grossly imbalanced in PvP at the moment. Explosive Shot might be a bit too high, but we aren't nerfing it for the moment. We'll see how things feel once some of the changes to other classes are in place.

<br />
Apparentely, they didn't consider it could be exploited when they designed it that way (i.e. using rfc or stockades to teleport to dalaran while the hearth is on cooldown). They don't wanna call it an exploit either, so they are sticking with bug, and just changing it so that the teleport simply gets you out of the instance.<br />
<br />
It will be pretty funny if it still burns your hearthstone cooldown though.<br />
<br />
P.S.: At least they reduced the cooldown on the hearthstone.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gilfanon</div><div class="date">2009-02-28, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that's the point.<br />
<br />
No one let them bloom. It was a wasted effect and it caused druids to micromanage their lifebloom stacks. They wanted to make it so you had more of a choice in the matter in what you did. Right now once you get 3 stacks you would never let it drop during the fight, not it might be worthwhile to do so.<br />
<br />
<br />
So now you won't have a choice BUT to let it bloom. Given that it takes a few seconds to get a 3 stack back after a bloom, and any subsequent Lifebloom cast after the first 3 is wasted mana now, that means stacking Lifebloom becomes utterly useless. This pretty much completely reinvents PvE Resto Druid playstyle from the ground up- with all the buffs to Nourish it's clear that they want Restos to chuck the occasional HOT to benefit Glyphed Nourish, and then spend the rest of their time spamming one button (maybe 2 if you add in Wild Growth). I actually enjoyed the micromanagement side of Druid healing, it added a modicum of interest to it- now they just made the most boring part of the game (healing) infinitely more dull. <br />
<br />
Great change...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nozuka</div><div class="date">2009-02-28, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lifebloom: Mana cost of all ranks doubled. When Lifebloom blooms or is dispelled, it now refunds half the base mana cost of the spell per application of Lifebloom, and the heal effect is multiplied by the number of applications.<br />
<br />
the description is not very clear about that, but its possible that the endbloom heal is 3x too with 3 stacks.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gilfanon</div><div class="date">2009-02-28, 11:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it's pretty clear that the endbloom will be 3X what it is currently. I'd be cool with this change if they actually gave us a 'dispell Lifebloom' spell (make Swiftmend affect Lifebloom and reduce the CD maybe), so that we could control when the bloom happens, but without that the bloom is basically useless since it's uncontrolled healing that happens whenever the Lifebloom happens to run out, regardless of whether the tank is at full health or not. Plus we have to spend 3GCDs getting the Lifebloom up again to use that random bloom- not viable when a tank is receiving craploads of damage. <br />
<br />
This does pretty much destroy the one purpose of Lifebloom, which was to even out incoming tank damage and make it less bursty. Way to completely nullify our iconic spell...</div></div><hr />

Dont forget TNT no longer stuns and 6% crit nerf, then they add 6% dmg increase instead, but nerf it by 10%.<br />
<br />
Then they add a glyph that adds a 4% crit to explosive shot, making us waste a glyph. <br />
<br />
Overall its a 2% crit nerf AND a waste of a major glyph.<br />
And a 4% dmg nerf if u spec TNT. (wich is kinda stupid with the stun nerf imo).<br />
And also the Disengage nerf by 5 seconds is LOL. I have a 16 sec Disengage cause of the glyph. But im keeping the glyph, else its a 10 sec nerf :(.<br />
So thats another Major Glyph wasted, Why not just remove the glyph?<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Basically hardmode = more challenges. Same mobs you're fighting but different tactics = new content.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ulduar is NEW content, suck it up or choke on it. Get over the old PreBC days of 1 guild on each server being the only ones to progress. Anyone that can't handle that, move on since you can't seem to grasp what a business is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Hardmodes that significantly change the dynamics of the fight ARE new content. Sarth with his drakes up, killing the Iron Council in a different order to make a COMPLETELY different phase 3 every time, Freya with 3 Elders alive, etc definitely change a lot about the encounter. Not to mention that every hard mode drops much higher ilvl loot, and the 4 watcher hardmodes (Thorim, Hodir, Freya, Mimiron) must all be defeated in order to attune your raid to open the door leading to Algalon, a hardmode-only boss that from all indication will take a long damn time to master.<br />
<br />
Actually gaining access to Algalon will be a feat in and of itself (35 million HP of Hodir in 3 minutes? Dealing with a 1-shotting Steelbreaker through Phases 2 and 3 of Iron Council?), and actually beating him will probably be the pinnacle of WotLK raiding until Arthas. Hardcore raiders and casuals alike finally have all the content in the world to keep them satisfied. Stop complaining because you don't like casuals being able to &quot;see&quot; bosses.<br />
<br />
TL;DR: Cry more scrub.</div></div><hr />

Face the fact: Freya on &quot;easy mode&quot; = Freya. Freya on &quot;hard mode&quot; = Freya! (OMG!11!!SHIFTONE! It's not even a secret twin sister!!!).<br />

<br />
First, would you rather that they release the content, and find out that it either doesn't work, or that there is a way to trivialize the content? Maybe they could allow bad guilds to test it, and then when noone can complete the encounter on the PTR they can make it easier.<br />
<br />
Testing is a good thing. Bleeding edge guilds don't like it when they can't complete (or world first) an encounter because of a bug and then it gets fixed for the other continent before them and so on and so on.<br />
<br />
<br />
Face the fact: Freya on &quot;easy mode&quot; = Freya. Freya on &quot;hard mode&quot; = Freya! (OMG!11!!SHIFTONE! It's not even a secret twin sister!!!)<br />
<br />
Is it the same model? Absolutely.<br />
Is it the same basic attacks? Absolutely.<br />
Is is the same encounter? Definitely not.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard changed the names and models of Freya hard mode, would that make everyone happy? You don't take the same number of tanks to hard mode as you do &quot;easy&quot;, you don't take the same number of healers, you don't take the same build of DPS (burst, sustained, mobile, melee vs. ranged) tanks (DK's cooldowns vs. the rest) or healers (Wild Growth/Circle of Healing vs. more Paladins, etc.)... And if someone says they do take the exact same group for every hard mode, maybe they're not min-maxing for the encounters as the &quot;hardest mode&quot; guilds do.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, here's what it comes down to, depending on how you define progression in raiding.<br />
<br />
If you progress for gear, hard modes give you better.<br />
If you progress for prestige (or do do things other guilds haven't/can't), hard modes give you better.<br />
If you progress for challenges, hard modes give you better.<br />
<br />
Hard modes = progression, yes?<br />
<br />
<br />
And I'd like to know how did he get his raid frames like that. Looks like a custom Grid layout<br />

Face the fact: Freya on &quot;easy mode&quot; = Freya. Freya on &quot;hard mode&quot; = Freya! (OMG!11!!SHIFTONE! It's not even a secret twin sister!!!).<br />
<br />
IF killing her on hard mode opens a door to Icecrown Citadel (new dungeon = new content! OMG!1!!1!), then it would be progress going from easy to hard mode, but still same content (Icecrown would be new content, not her!).<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Except that in this case, Freya on hard mode literally DOES open a door to new progression. In order to gain access to Algalon the Observer's room (hardest encounter in the game, doesn't have a hard mode because he IS the definition of hard mode), you have to beat Hodir, Freya, Thorim, and Mimiron on all of their hardest difficulties. Only then can you PROGRESS through to the final encounter, and presumably the best loot in the game (along with the vanity items).<br />
<br />
So yes, guess what, those specific 4 hard modes ARE progression, no matter which way you look at it. And for the rest, they all drop significantly better loot from their Hard Modes, and it appears to change the fight dynamic consistently. There's a big difference between a &quot;falling 65 yards&quot; achievement and one that stretches your guild to the limits to beat what essentially is normal content with many, many twists to up the difficulty.<br />
<br />
It's scrubs like you that fail to understand this that are polluting the game.<br />

Keep in mind that it's the PTR and things sell for redicolous amounts on AH. On one PTR when I forgot to bring gold over when I copied my chars I just made 10k gold in a few hours selling herbs. People don't care what they pay since it's the PTR.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all, 'packing up your toys and moving to another game' is not the answer. That is more of a defeatest attitude than hope to change things.<br />
<br />
Second, you want constructive criticism? Well, here it is for you.<br />
<br />
The Amani Bear was available to people for 8 months, which in my calculation is almost a year. We have not even been through half of that and Blizzard is taking away the proto-drakes? Oh, by the way, you can still do the achievement. But why? For a lousy 20 achievement points that are completely useless? I mean, you cannot spend achievement points on anything, so why have the actual achievement? The other issue revolved around this was the Amani bear was removed due to a MAJOR patch and content upgrade with the expansion of Wrath of the Lich King. This is a minor upgrade, a minor patch that is like a 'chapter' of a book - not a whole new book. If you doubt my perspective on this, there are over 60 pages about this on the WoW forums, and a large majority believe this is unfair. If Blizzard wants people to complete achievements, they should still offer something for completing them. Once they remove Glory of the Raider and Heroic Glory of the Raider proto-drakes as rewards, no one will be motivated to complete those achievements. <br />
<br />
Now, banking off the above mentioned issue. One of my pet peeves involves developers not even finishing a game when it is released. Blizzard should have taken another 6 months to make sure ALL of the content was available before releasing Wrath of the Lich King. Instead, they just patched things together and are going to progressively add new stuff when they see fitting in their own time. An expansion should have all things available upon its release. Content additions should only enhance that expansion, not continually adding to an unfinished product.<br />
<br />
Moving now to class imbalance. The Mage and Rogue used to be the best DPS classes in the game for their respective class types (mage caster, rogue physical). Now, they are sub-par. Both classes need a major DPS overhaul and upgrade. Blizzard does not offer versitility in class selection. In order to do the most DPS, a mage is forced to play Arcane Talent, since it has many spell power and haste talents. <br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
Let's just take a 'bare bones' spell that caster DPS uses a lot (not including DoTs).<br />
<br />
A shaman's lightning bolt is 715-815 damage , with a 2.5 s cast time. That works out in math to be about 326 damage (max) per second - without talents, without gear, without anything to enhance it.<br />
<br />
A mage's frostfire bolt is 722-835 damage per 3 second cast time, which works out to be 279 damage (max) per second - again without talents, without gear, without anything to enhance it.<br />
<br />
That is a huge DPS disparity. 47 more damage per second does not seem like a lot, but within 30 seconds, the Shaman has out-dps'ed the mage by 1410 points. And, this is without enhancements, gear, talents, etc. <br />
<br />
Blizzard promised that they will make Spirit a more &quot;useful and interesting talent for mages.&quot; In what way? Give them more mana regeneration? They don't need it. There are about 2 talents in each Mage tree that increases mana regeneration. Mages don't need mana regeneration, they need comparable damage output talents that are not restricted to deep Arcane. I rarely run out of mana on raids and can go full guns blazing with everything. But Blizzard promised this right on the edge of 3.1 being announced. It has been over a month, and nothing - not one iota - has been mentioned about it since. <br />
<br />
Who is getting a boost? Priests DPS , which is not needed; Arms Warrior DPS - which could be useful (but current testing has suggested that the Arms warrior is STILL being sidelined in Ulduar); and Death Knights who SURELY don't need it. Blizzard needs to make the mage and rogue classes competitive again in their damage. In fact, one PvP team decided to withdraw from professional tournaments because Blizzard refuses to fix these classes as viable options for PvP. The article was on Allakhazam which I cannot find anymore.<br />
<br />
Then there is the issue of set design for the different tiers. I find it quite sad that still the BEST Tiered design outfit for mages as far as appearance is concerned is the Tier 2 set. And I am sure people who play the rogue and look at the Tier 8 set loathe it, because of the hideous and laughable helm that comes with that set - thank goodness you can choose not to show helms in your options menu. All Blizzard has done with the current Tier sets is create the SAME design but add different colors. That is it. There used to be very distinct differences between the appearance of T1, T2, T3. Now, if you look at the T7 and T7.5 stuff, they look exactly the same - except different in color. To me, that is just being lazy in game design. I don't mind everything looking 'dark' and 'cold' - but there are ways it can be done that still look like designers didn't just throw it together on a whim. The thing I am looking for here is 'tasteful.' Tiered gear should bring out one of the best features of the design's team capability for uniqueness and style. <br />
<br />
And onto a completely different topic. Server stability. The older servers need to be transfered and upgraded. Creating new servers is not going to solve anything. Some guilds have split over the decision to stay on an old server or move to a new server that Blizzard created specifically for transfers (i.e., Nessingwary). Fix the servers you already have, then worry about creating new ones. With 11 million subscribers, they have the cash to do so. I would not mind giving up World of Warcraft for a week if it meant that older servers are upgraded to ensure better stability. Whatever the issue is, Blizzard refuses to do this and instead comes up with a 'band-aid' solution.<br />
<br />
So, do I leave World of Warcraft? No. I enjoy playing the game. However, I mention these things in hopes that someone might actually listen to it and maybe reconsider some of the things being done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the only paragraph I had a distinct problem with. First of all, Tier 2 is god-awful ugly. I'm not sure if we're looking at the same one but those shoulders and the helm look like they were designed by a 2 year old with a box of Crayons. So I definitely disagree with you there. <br />
<br />
Second, the T8 rogue set is fucking awesome looking. First thing I think of when I see it is Nosferatu creeping up the stairs to his victims. It's amazingly creepy looking and I love it for a rogue. Personally, after the travesties that were tier 4-6 I'm happy to see something a bit more original. <br />
<br />
Also, T7 and T7.5 are actually the same on purpose because they are the same tier from the same dungeons just on a different difficulty level. It's still easy to pick them out, like DKs for instance. If I see a DK I can easily tell a difference between T7 and T7.5 because one is blue and one is red. It's not too hard. Either way, they're meant to look the same since they are both in reality &quot;T7&quot; while T8 is going to look completely different just like T1-T7 did.<br />
<br />
Personally, I like the designs they are doing now much more then some of the old designs (except paladin t2. I Love that set even though they've tried to kill it by recoloring it a billion times.) Perhaps this my disagreement with you is a distinct difference in taste, which might be. But I just feel you're unfairly nitpicking in that paragraph above. You can complain about their game design all day if you want, and I actually mostly agreed with what you said about that, but moving into the design of things seemed strange especially considering the beauty of some of the locales in Wrath and the originality of the new tiers, despite some peoples' misgivings about them.<br />
<br />
On another note, boubouille, the Mana for heroic freya is right in that screenshot of her defeated: 234190 mana. Not that mana means anything on a boss, I don't think I've ever seen mana go down on a boss. But yeah, just thought I'd point that out.</div></div><hr />

Meh, he's still kind of the &quot;Final&quot; boss. You have to do all the hard modes to get to him, and you don't for Yogg. So, I'd say he's more of a final boss or rather a &quot;Final Challenge&quot; for raids and guilds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Please explain to me how you're going to magically beat Hodir's 3 minute timer, dealing 35 million damage in 180 seconds, if you're not decked out in full Ulduar gear (including Yogg-Saron high ilvl items). Assuming 2 Tanks, 3 Healers, and the fight mechanics exactly how they were on PTR, it'd require every single one of your 20 DPS'ers dishing out 10k+ DPS. Good luck doing that only from Naxx 25 gear and the few ilvl 226 items you get from the first half of the instance.<br />
<br />
How can you honestly not understand that Algalon is the hardest boss in the game, making it the pinnacle and &quot;final encounter&quot; for raiders to triumph over. The hardest modes of those 4 watchers are much, much more difficult that any of the default 13 bosses in Ulduar.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pewpewarrows</div><div class="date">2009-03-02, 12:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lets come back to this convo when Ensidia and co. killed Algalon in the 2nd ID of Ulduar release. Algalon might be the HARDEST encounter in the whole WoW history, but he isnt the last one of Ulduar.<br />
<br />
<br />
Progression wise, he is the last boss. And again, Algalon is not going to be downed by the second raid week. Not even close. You're telling me Ensidia has 20 DPS'ers capable right now to do 10k sustained DPS over 180 seconds? Because they don't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And well, how are you going to prove me, what numbers will be in the last version of those bosses? Not even Algalon is open of testing on the PTR, nor you ever seen the hard modes of the watchers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hodir's hard modes were on the PTR. The hardest being to kill him in 3 minutes. And yes, Algalon is the last boss in progression, since he is the hardest. Progression isn't always linear, any real raider will tell you that.</div></div><hr />

Hmmm, you dont know jack shit, so stop speculating.<br />
<br />
<br />
At 3, 6 and 9 minutes he runs to the back of his room and breaks one of his chests of loot. The 9 minute one triggers his hard enrage.

It's just as hard as realizing that fighting Freya with her Elders is a hard mode like Sarth. It's not speculation, it's just not being stupid.</div></div><hr />

KJ was a prize for beating Muru. No guild that beat Muru couldn't down KJ. Muru was the finale of TBC progression. KJ was just sweet, sweet victory, and icing on the cake so to speak.</div></div><hr />

Not really, because you can go do Yogg-Saron without fighting Algalon. This is ALSO in the flavor text. You MUST kill the 4 watchers on hard mode to do Algalon. This cannot be done without killing Yogg-Saron first. So therefor, Algalon is after Yogg-Saron. Now, we are not sure if Yogg-Saron is going to be harder then Algalon but seeing that Algalon is not possible without doing the 4 watchers on hard mode, which seems to be extremely hard, we can postulate that Algalon is going to be hard or harder then Yogg-Saron.<br />
<br />
My point being. You saying Yogg-Saron is the last boss and us saying Algalon is the last boss is both based on postulate, not facts. But we are backing it up while you are just calling us names which is a ineffective fallacy in arguments.</div></div><hr />

Yet since its recent discovery, many have wondered what the structure's original purpose may have been. Some thought it a city, built to herald the glory of its makers; some thought it a vault containing innumerable treasures, perhaps even relics of the mighty Titans themselves. Such speculations were wrong. Beyond Ulduar's gates lies no city, no treasure vault, no final answer to the Titan's mysteries. All that awaits those who dare set foot in Ulduar is a horror even the Titans could not, would not destroy, an evil they merely... contained.<br />
<br />
Beneath ancient Ulduar, the Old God of death lies, whispering.... Tread carefully, or its prison will become your tomb.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yogg-Saron = Old God of death = endboss of Ulduar.<br />

Algalon is a story they don't want us to know about. It's supposed to be a surprise,really. There's a reason why they don't mention it in that description. Thing is, you're using a lore description of the dungeon as the proof. Lore doesn't really make it the end-boss. The progression does. You had to kill M'uru to get to Kil'jaeden. Therefor, Kil'Jaeden was the endboss. You have to kill Yogg-Saron to get to Algalon. Therefor, Algalon is the end boss. There's not much to it, really. :P</div></div><hr />

He is an optional encounter, most guilds will probably need yogg's loot in ordner to complete the hardmodes, but you definitly dont need to kill him to get to an optional encounter.<br />
<br />
Lore made Kil'jaeden to SWP's endboss, just like Illidan of BT, KT of TK, Vashj of SSC, Ragnaros of MC - so why whouldnt lore make yogg-saron the endboss of his own prison he's currently breaking out? You're talking nonsense.<br />
<br />
<br />
But you DO have to do Yogg-Saron to do Algalon. As Pewpewarrows said elegently earlier, you must do Yogg to get the gear to do the hardmodes to get the items to open the area to Algalon. So the progression here is: Yogg -&gt; Hard Modes -&gt; Algalon. So, therefor, progression-wise Algalon is the end-boss. Perhaps Lore-Wise and Story-Wise you can say Yogg-Saron is. Really, we're arguing here looking at this from two different perspectives. Therefor, it's useless. :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
it will be the most difficult and most rewarding boss.<br />
<br />
Even in lore, it is like the dangerous like, because if it isn't destroy it will prevent the titans the world is near failure and titan could choose to erase it. Even worse than to let Yogg-saron loose.<br />
<br />
so yeah, totally optional, but totally new content for hardcore guild who want to PROGRESS.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
blizzad make the good choices. I am NOT a hardcore gamer. I do NOT want to spend days each week just for a game, but I want to see new instances, great landscape and beautiful crafted boss and crazy strategies.<br />
<br />
Now I can. No more &quot;kael'thas25&quot; for just a mere hundreds of geeks.<br />
<br />
BUT if you are really hardcore, you will be able to do the boss in tremendous difficult setup, to see a whole new world of pain and have access to delirious items and stuff I'll never never touch.<br />
<br />
so yeah, you will still be pretty god. but the content will be workable and nice for everyone.<br />

blizzard does not want to create contents just for some weird hardcore guys in a cave. It's why Wow is a so successful and nice game : playable by many kind of gamers. Sometimes Blizzard make mistakes, they learn from it.</div></div><hr />

my guild raids 3 nights a week for 4 hours. Under that schedule, we cleared everything at level 60, up until naxx, only got 3 bosses in there.<br />
<br />
In BC, we had SSC and TK cleared before Hyjal and BT came out. We had Hyjal and BT cleared before Sunwell came out. We finally killed Muru the week before the raid nerf, and Kiljaeden a few weeks after, just cuz some people took time off.<br />
<br />
<br />
Does my spending 12 hours a week raiding, mean i live in a cave? You call poeple who are succesful raiders, &quot;weird&quot; people. But just so you know, you are the one spending time posting on a WoW forum, you are not exactly Mr. Cool. Im sorry that you, or the guild you were in, were too bad to do any raids in BC before the raid nerf, so now you feel the need to call them a &quot;failure&quot; by blizzard. Thousands of people, including myself, strongly disagree.</div></div><hr />

I think you just put your foot in it there. You've admitted it's a prison for Yogg-Saron. Now, do tell, who exactly would the &quot;boss&quot; of this prison be? The prisoner? Or maybe, just maybe, it would be the Observer, Algalon? Keeping an eye on the situation for the Titans, hinted at by the following quests:<br />

It's ok, I'll sum it up for you.<br />
<br />
They don't want to kill the Old Gods because of their symbiotic relationship with Azeroth at the moment, which is why they imprisoned them instead. Wanting to try their best to save Azeroth, they tried imprisoning them, hoping that would be enough. But this is proof that imprisonment isn't enough, so they'll be coming back to destroy the Old Gods once and for all, along with their &quot;failed experiment&quot; of Azeroth.<br />
<br />
Besides, I meant &quot;boss&quot; in the sense that someone working for an organisation would be the boss of a place.<br />
<br />
Between that, and the fact that Algalon is the end point of the main questline in the zone, I fail to see how he could be considered anything but the boss of the place.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heliades</div><div class="date">2009-03-02, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did HoS. The point here being in Yogg-Saron trying to escape out of his prison, Algalon is sending a msg to the titans to destroy Azeroth. He's taking no action against Yogg except sending the msg - we, as the heroes of Azeroth are going to stop this.<br />
<br />
What main questline? It's just a quest you get there for defeating Algalon, then you go to Rhonin and send a false msg to the titans, telling them everything is ok. The point for us, heroes / raiders is, to stop Yogg-Sarons actions in Northrend. If he wouldnt be escaping, Algalon wouldnt try to send the msg, and everything would be ok be default - but its not.<br />
<br />
__________<br />
<br />
Good point with the quest, tho. But you also get the legendary weapon quest which ends with yogg. Just like you get one questline in Karazhan for Nightbanes Urn, and the other which ends in defeating the Prince, so who's the boss now? Yes, the Prince, because Nightbane is another optional boss.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Strange logic here. Your logic is: We are stopping Yogg-Saron so Algalon, who is already sending a message no matter what we do, stops sending his message to the Titans to kill Yogg-Saron so therefore we kill Yogg-Saron stop Algalon from something he's already doing. Makes no sense. Algalon is the culmination of the whole raid. You've killed Yogg. You killed all the watchers on hard mode and gotten their Sigil. You've learned that this automated &quot;machine&quot; of sorts is already sending a message to the Titans and it could result in our demise. Therefor, you kill Algalon in order to save Azeroth. <br />
<br />
By the way, Guilds will most certainly kill Yogg-Saron before they get to Algalon because he is more easily gotten to then Algalon is. You're honestly telling me that, just for the hell of it, top guilds are going to pause their progression and ignore Yogg-Saron just to do the hard modes of the watchers to do Algalon to THEN do Yogg-Saron, who they could've gotten to the whole time? Ummm, no, they're not.<br />
<br />
Also, you do not have to kill Prince to get to Nightbane. Nor do you have to kill Prince after Nightbane. You really only need to do the first half of the dungeon. You do a quest to talk to all the guys in the Library to get Medivh's Journal from Shade of Aran. Then you go do Shattered Halls and Sethekk Halls to finish the quest. Finally, you get the urn to summon him. You don't even NEED to do Prince. Not sure where you got that from. Prince is the final boss because he's at the end of the dungeon. Yogg-Saron isn't really at the end of the dungeon, nor is Algalon. Hell, I'm not even sure where Algalon is. The thing that is confusing you here is that Ulduar is not linear like most raids are. There's two &quot;wings&quot; to it. There's one boss at the end of a wing, and another boss at the other end of the wing. First wing: Yogg-Saron. Second wing: Algalon. Algalon is harder to get to and takes more effort in terms of progression so therefor he is the final boss in the progression.<br />
<br />
I mean, for god's sake. They called him Algalon THE DEVOURER OF RAIDS. He apparently feeds on your TEARS. This dude is hardcore.</div></div><hr />
