Blizzard / Dell partnership : New wallpapers<br />
Dell launched a new Dell XPS Gaming line with the support of Blizzard and created a WoW themed website (http://www.dell.com/html/global/topics/gaming/en/us/us/dhs/wow-signup.html) for the occasion. After giving away your name and email you will eventually end up here (http://dellgamingus.p.delivery.net/m/p/del/wow/Thankyou.html) with 6 wallpapers available at the bottom of the page. <br />
<br />
The 2nd wallpaper (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/november/dell/w2_1920x1200.jpg) looks a lot like Kael'thas happily reviving things near the Sunwell, but I could be wrong. (Nice spaulders by the way)<br />
<br />
Update : It seems that it's an artwork used for an old TCG Card : Varanis Bitterstar (http://wow.tcgplayer.com/db/card.asp?id=469). No uber sunwell for you today people !<br />

WTB Hortus on EU forums too - at least we could have someone who is blue and can answer things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I for one can not see what you mean by reviving, he does nothing of the sort, he just stands there and and fights the undead with his staff. (the fireballs that flys around him is nothing new), and well the flowers just next to him looks like, (if I'm not mistaken), arthas' tears.<br />
<br />
anyway, but still on the topic of the sunwell, have they revealed who the &quot;famous character&quot; are going to be? My guesses are on either Sylvanas Windrunner or Anveena Teague or Kalecgos. <br />
<br />
Remember blizzards love for dragons, and there haven't realy been any dragons out of late, so my guesses are on Kalecgos, though, it don't have to be in a fight as I dubt we'd get a chanse to fight him. And if Anveena would be there, Our help would be of nought, she is afterall, The Sunwell ^_^</div></div><hr />

Who knows when that happens, or if we will get it at all on PTR ~~</div></div><hr />
