Rated Battlegrounds<br />
Rated Battlegrounds will be an alternative way to get arena points.<br />
Each week, one of the BG will be the Rated Battleground of the week. Winning in this battleground will improve your rating and give you points. Losing will not lower your rating. <br />
New PvP titles will be added, as your rating progress you will unlock higher titles. If you earned a PvP title you will keep it. <br />
When a Battleground is rated for the week, its normal non-rated version will still be available. <br />
The amount of Arena Points will be limited to prevent grinding. <br />
You will also earn guild level by playing these rated battlegrounds with your guildmates.<br />
<br />
Tol'barad<br />
Tol'barad is a mix of Lake Wintergrasp and the Isle of Quel'danas. <br />
Every x hours the Daily Quests of the zone will shutdown and players will fight to capture the control points, the first team to get all of them wins. <br />
The winning team gets access to better daily quests rewarding more gold/better items. <br />
<br />
Guild Leveling<br />
Guild experience is earned through multiple ways, players leveling, killing bosses, leveling professions, PvP victories, reputations. <br />
Each guild level rewards you with one talent point, these talents affect the whole guild. The top 20 earners of the guild will contribute to the guild experience for the day. <br />
Some of the guild talents will allow you to remove reagent costs from spell, get increased gold drops, summon your entire raid, rez your entire raid after a wipe, automatically transfer a % of gold dropped by bosses to the guild bank. Guild talents can be reset.<br />
Once your guild reached level 20, the guild experience becomes a currency and let you buy things like mounts, professions plans, banners, potions, rare reagents and guild talent respecs. <br />
Anyone can learn a guild profession recipe, if you leave the guild after learning it you will loose the recipe and it will be transferred back to the guild bank. Guild heirlooms also work the same way and are bound to the guild. <br />
<br />
Guild Interface<br />
Guilds will have their own achievements, some of the old achievements might be converted to guild achievements. Some of the achievements are building a legendary item, maxing out every profession, etc ...<br />
A guild news feed will be added, it will shows boss kills, items looted, it will come with different filters to let you find specific information.<br />
You can now check the professions of every members of your guild and check their recipes list to see if they can create an item. <br />
You will also be able to invite other guilds to your guild events through the in-game calendar. <br />
<br />
Mastery system<br />
There are too many talents right now and a lot of them are boring and just give passive bonuses. (1% hit bonus, etc ...)<br />
The goal is to make talents more fun and useful, Body and Soul (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/64129/body-and-soul/) or Juggernaut (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/64976/juggernaut/) are a good example. <br />
The old passive bonuses will be automatically added to your character through the Mastery system as you spend more points in a talent tree. Spending a lot of points in Fury will give you extra crit, etc ... this will be implemented for all classes.<br />
Mastery bonuses will lower energy cost, increase your armor penetration, etc ... <br />
<br />
Path of the Titans <br />
Character progression slows down drastically at level 80. Players will improve their character through the Path of the Titan by using the new Archeology profession.<br />
Archeology rewards you with &quot;Ancient Glyphs&quot; and give you bonuses reduced damage, reduced stun duration, etc ... <br />
They are NOT inscription glyphs and are totally different, as you progress after level 85 you will earn points to buy more glyphs. They are tied to your talent specialization and cannot be respecced. <br />
You will eventually get all your ancient glyphs, but hardcore players will get them faster. There will be a weekly limit to how fast you can get them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Path of the Titans<br />
Here is an official description of the Path of the Titans sytem by Aratil from the official systems panel write up. <br />
Path of the Titans<br />
Path of the Titans is another great new feature we covered that encompasses rewarding progression at max level. This new feature implements a third new type of glyph called “Ancient Glyph,” and as you can see, it is themed after the titans. These special glyphs are not associated with the Inscription tradeskill, and are also not specific to any class.<br />
<br />
You’re able to unlock a path and progress within that path as you continuously engage in different aspects of the game. As you advance, you will be able to unlock special glyph sockets for your character. You can also respec your path at any time, in case you decide to change your path.<br />
<br />
You earn these ancient glyphs by using the new Archaeology secondary profession to recover and trade in titan artifacts. Each path will have 2-3 choices per rank, and again, you can respec if you decide to go down another path.<br />
- Path of Aman’Thul, the High Father<br />
- Path of Eonar, the Lifebinder<br />
- Path of Norgannon, the Dreamweaver<br />
- Path of Khaz’Goroth, the Shaper<br />
- Path of Aggramar, the Avenger<br />
- Path of Golganneth, the Thunderer<br />
<br />
You can earn progress down any of these paths by doing things such as questing, raiding, PvP, trade skills, etc., with a possible weekly cap for maximum progress. Over time, you’ll be able to unlock new ancient glyphs that will greatly benefit your character.<br />
<br />
This new system will be accessible to all players at max level. Players will eventually be able to reach new ranks for ancient glyphs, encouraging them to further develop their characters. There is also a possibility that we will introduce whole new paths in future content patches. <br />
<br />

<br />
Dito. This really wants me to come back playing WoW, and probably will (just like Lich King did - stopped played a year before it, played it half a year, got bored). The only thing I really hope is that they make shadowpriests viable in pvp again. I have a priest, rogue, dk and druid, but love the priest the most, since it is my first maxlevel char ever.</div></div><hr />

It all sounds good but I'm still waiting to see what makes the final cut and in what shape. Guild progression sounds good on paper but I can see it quickly turning large/successful guilds into cliques of elitists (well, bigger elitists) and it will almost certainly thin out the number of guilds as people vie to be in a guild that has a lot more talent points and earned more achievements. I hope they address the potential issue of guilds becoming FOTM like so many classes and builds are right now. I still like the idea, just not without reservation.</div></div><hr />

- Do rated BGs mean random BGs? or premade BGs? Can i just click &quot;Join Battleground&quot; and earn Arena Points (if my Team wins) or do I have to find 10 people from my server for that?<br />
<br />
- If all the passive Talents are moved from the Talent Trees to the &quot;Mastery&quot; Tree... how can they possibly replace that many passive talents with NEW and &quot;INTERESTING&quot; talents? A tree still has to have at least 51 different talents, right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There will be a maximum of 76 talent points to spend at level 85 (compared to the 71 points we have now). Doesn't have to have 76 different talents with 1 point in each. Some of the talents will be 3 point talents, some will be 5 point talents etc.<br />
<br />
Thou i'd agree, there's gonna be a lot of passive talents which will be removed from the talent trees and added to the mastery system.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Infernix</div><div class="date">2009-08-22, 08:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 questions that probably nobody can answer ::) :<br />
<br />
- Do rated BGs mean random BGs? or premade BGs? Can i just click &quot;Join Battleground&quot; and earn Arena Points (if my Team wins) or do I have to find 10 people from my server for that?<br />
<br />
- If all the passive Talents are moved from the Talent Trees to the &quot;Mastery&quot; Tree... how can they possibly replace that many passive talents with NEW and &quot;INTERESTING&quot; talents? A tree still has to have at least 51 different talents, right?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Each week, a different BG will be made the Rated BG for the week. Kinda like how they have bonus-HP BGs every week. You're encouraged to join as a group(with your guildies) because your Guild earns Guild Points for winning Rated BGs as a group. Guild Effort=Guild Points.<br />
<br />
But, yeah, you can que up by yourself and get Arena points. The way I understand it, you get a rating increase and Arena Points when you win a Rated BG, and you get NOTHING when you lose. No rating gain and no Arena points. Meaning that if you're persistent enough and patient enough, you'll eventually get your weekly Arena Points. And if you're even more persistent, you can keep getting rating boosts from the rare victory. Since your rating increase doesn't have a weekly cap, you can keep queing and queing and hoping for victories.<br />
<br />
The new BG grind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thou i'd agree, there's gonna be a lot of passive talents which will be removed from the talent trees and added to the mastery system.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah i know it doesn´t have to be 1 pointers... but take a look at the paladin holy tree for example. t1 and t2 talents alone are ALL passive and i wouldn´t consider them to be &quot;fun&quot;. that´s 5 completely different talents and 20 talent points they have to completely redesign to be &quot;fun&quot;. Dunno how they could possibly come up with so many new exciting and BALANCED talents.

I always liked BGs much better then arenas, guild vs guild ABs were the bomb back in classic, it'd great if they brought back that feeling.<br />
I hope they fix up the BGs though; like SotA and AV and Isle need alot of work to be fun in rated games with organized teams on vent.<br />

But anyways, S1 rated battle grounds will be awesome nonetheless, just because most teams won't be running with FotM set ups yet and it'll be new 'n fresh.<br />

Character progression doesn't nessiccarely mean gaining a level. Getting a new ability, a new talent, a new glyph is character progression. Gaining a level for the sake of it is not.<br />
<br />
Also, they seem to borrow A WHOLE LOT from WAR. Guild levels, guild talents, passive boni for putting talent points into a talent tree, that's all directly taken from WAR. Not that that's a bad thing though.</div></div><hr />

In order to participate in rated Battlegrounds, players will be required to join battles as full groups. However these groups do not need to be committed teams as in the Arena system; rather, the group simply needs to have the required amount of players for whichever Battleground they’re entering. As an example, one would need to join the queue as a group for Warsong Gulch with any nine additional players to qualify for a rating. <br />
<br />
That really sucks though. I don't want to be in TS/Vent all the time for battlegrounds, I just want to hop in and do whatever needs to be done in that particular battleground. It's possible to coordinate with strangers too...<br />
<br />
Oh and from the same bluepost:<br />
<br />
You’re able to unlock a path and progress within that path as you continuously engage in different aspects of the game. As you advance, you will be able to unlock special glyph sockets for your character. You can also respec your path at any time, in case you decide to change your path. <br />
<br />

Once again, all of you saying this is becoming World of Casualcraft are retarded.<br />

<br />
1) They are talking about limiting rated battles to 6 or more a week.<br />
<br />
2) You must que as a group.<br />
<br />
3) They are adding guild levels and talents.<br />
<br />
4) There will be guild awards and achievements for pvp.<br />
<br />
Get we're I'm going? Say hello to it being required for you to either join the top PvP guilds on your server or transfer to a more active one. If not, all you've got is 3v3 or 5v5.<br />

You're going to have a huge influx of new elite guilds concentrating on PvP. Players are not going to see the freedom of gameplay, they were hoping for. This is setup for the WorldofMing crowd with connections.</div></div><hr />

blizzard will never learn.. they try to do 2 much well at once in wow and mess it all up.. the main reason Classic was so good is that they had yet to start silly things like &quot;battleground pvp balance&quot; &quot;arena pvp balance&quot;... &quot;honor revamps&quot; etc etc..<br />
<br />
keep it simple.. and stop the silly Achivment/Daily/forced grind character stuff..<br />
<br />
its as bad as farming resistance gear &lt;_&lt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Very few people like being handed stuff. And a majority of the player base likes the Achievement system. It's the only thing left in this game that establishes any sort of sense of accomplishment. If you don't like achievements or easy gold, then don't do achievements or dailies. But don't act like WoW is over because something you yourself don't like is going in.<br />

Why can ppl just read things b4 jumping conclusions.. They say that the glyphs cannot be respecced but you CAN change the path at any time. This means that every glyph you may earn is for your specific path, and you cant go back and get a different one for that path, what you can do is change your path and grab new ones for that new path. If you chose wrong glyph this time, all you have to do is keep farming, and wend you get a new glyph make sure you now go get the one you intended in the first place, ending up with both of them.<br />
<br />
Looking at the panel SS's I'd say that this is nothing more then talent points being split into 2 systems, since they are taking off passive abilities from the talents you will now get those passive using the path of titans, were they are not imperative for you to play your class but just help things out a bit.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kimbald</div><div class="date">2009-08-22, 11:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me get this...<br />
<br />
BG rating will only work if you join as a premade? Be it a regular premade or a pugged one that night... it WILL have to be a premade.<br />
<br />
You will get points for winning, so NOT for going for objectives as an individual!<br />
<br />
The results will be:<br />
<br />
- faction unbalance will cause even more unbalance.<br />
<br />
- casual bg'ers will have to find a premade first if they want to get rewarded for their efforts.<br />
<br />
This is NOT what bg'ers asked for.<br />
<br />
Yes: awarding premades will be nice, but you can forget that you'll win as a pug in the given weekend, since it will be all PvP guild premades...<br />
<br />
But no: people will still not be rewarded for going for objectives instead of hk farming, UNLESS they are lucky enough to do that in a winning premade...<br />
<br />
<br />
Not saying the changes aren't nice for some (hardcore premades and pvp guilds mainly) but is by no means what most people loving bg's will benefit from. Not even those who always keep working towards objectives.<br />
<br />
I hope the new system gets adjusted.<br />
Getting points ONLY in group, and ONLY for winning (not for helping objectives even in a lost battle) is far too narrow minded.<br />
In this form it's basically giving ALL rewards to the premades of PvP guilds.<br />
Get ready to be steamrolled in every rated bg...<br />
<br />
Edit: this system is good in the way it rewards pvp guild premades, but it should add a more personal, indivual rating that you can get by going for objectives, even if not in a premade.</div></div><hr />

So we cant change the Glyphs in a specific Path we've taken but we can respec to a different Path, including the one we're already on, as long as we're willing to lose all the Glyphs we've already discovered?<br />

This means you can NOT afk-leech-whatever... or you have zero chance of winning.<br />
<br />
I don't like that it is full groups only for rated, leaving out individual players.<br />
But as it stands now this mechanic will not allow for afk or leeching,<br />
at least not more than an arena team lends itself for being carried...<br />
<br />
No group will enter with someone who doesn't work along.<br />
Not unless they are boosting his rating. This happens in arena and it can happen there.<br />
It can NOT happen however without the group agreeing.</div></div><hr />

something like that yeah thats my understanding at his time aswell..<br />
But imo the glyphs wont be 'lost', if you respec back to your old path you get an empty path but the glyphs you already discovered can be bought again. Character progression will make more path slots available, and the profession will make new glyphs available to chose from.</div></div><hr />

I think you and this site (Boub!) are interpreting that comment incorrectly.<br />
<br />
What he was saying is that character progression slows down drastically NOW - you do quests, you can see you are progressing, at a pace of your choice. And then you hit 80 and its BAM - against a wall<br />
and everything is slowed down.<br />
<br />
It is that they want to do something about, giving people something else to work at.<br />

I just wished to point out, to prevent future headaches, that the panel did actually state you could respec your Path of the Titans. You will indeed acquire all of your glyphs eventually, but you aren't locked into them. I think when they say acquire all of your glyphs, they mean for that specific path. Respeccing seems to be changing the path that you are on.</div></div><hr />

I am sorry but there are gamesout there that have been around far longer then WAR that have guild leveling.... RO has it and it has been around over 9 years. It is a great idea all around and it is fairly stupid to think just because WAR has it that the idea must have come from WAR.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pokchop</div><div class="date">2009-08-23, 06:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Didn't they mention that they are putting in ways for guilds to find new members and for people to find guilds? I think that's cool. The official forums recruitment forum is a joke. Realm forum advertisement? Realm forums are filled with nothing but attention whoring trolls who seek attention of the 5 people that actually post on them (in other words, general forum rejects). The guild recruitment channel is off by default and is Blizzard's poor attempt at filtering recruitment ads out of trade. Spamming trade does work to some extent, but it doesn't reach everyone. Hopefully, flagging for LFGuild will be global like LFG.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think the whole guild leveling is cool. Kind of pointless, but nice to have achievements attached to whole guilds for bragging rights I guess. And the perks are nice. Also, who ISN'T in a guild? It's as if Blizz thinks there is this epidemic of guildlessness. If you're guildless you'll be spammed with ginvites until you give in and stay in some crappy throwaguild so you won't be bothered.<br />
<br />
I don't see a point to guild heirlooms... if they were epic quality then you could loan them to fresh recruits until they start getting loot from your raids. <br />
<br />
But it just seems to be another stupid hurdle to get nice leveling gear. So now you have to craft them, but before that level the guild or find a leveled guild, and then beg and plead the GM to buy the heirloom plans and then beg and plead to have the guild crafters (IF ANY) make them for you... UGH. <br />
<br />
The ability to invite other guilds to events is really nice. Blizzard is catching onto the practice of guild alliances... only took them like 5 years. But HEY it's here!<br />

<br />
This is and the blue post is why they make us confused. One says cannot respec, while this panel says you can.<br />
<br />
Like someone said, it's probably only the glyphs u can't change. Respeccing your path will remove them but you have to earn them again. Somewhat like a slow respec. I do wish a blue can confirm this.</div></div><hr />

Getting a new ability, a new talent, a new glyph is character progression. Gaining a level for the sake of it is not.<br />
<br />
Also, they seem to borrow A WHOLE LOT from WAR. Guild levels, guild talents, passive boni for putting talent points into a talent tree, that's all directly taken from WAR. Not that that's a bad thing though.<br />
<br />
<br />
well guild levels and talents isnt something WAR invented. ragnarok had this for years. (and other MMO's too)<br />
<br />
but games are all about stealing stuff anyway - the trick is to steal it an make it better.</div></div><hr />

This really wants me to come back playing WoW, and probably will (just like Lich King did - stopped played a year before it, played it half a year, got bored). The only thing I really hope is that they make shadowpriests viable in pvp again. I have a priest, rogue, dk and druid, but love the priest the most, since it is my first maxlevel char ever.<br />

<br />
uh? newsflash? shadowplay is one of the most powerful 3s comp this season? aff lock, shadow priest, resto sham. some of the highest rated teams in the world have a spriest in it...</div></div><hr />

<br />
What he was saying is that character progression slows down drastically NOW - you do quests, you can see you are progressing, at a pace of your choice. And then you hit 80 and its BAM - against a wall<br />
and everything is slowed down.<br />
<br />
It is that they want to do something about, giving people something else to work at.<br />
<br />
I did NOT think what he was saying was &quot;81-85 are going to take a really really long time&quot;. And I don't think that is what he meant at all.<br />

<br />
This was my interpretation too. It basically means they want our characters to progress in more ways than just gear once we reach maximum level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;We implement cool stuff at Blizzard ! Gain Arena points without ever setting a foot in arena !<br />
You're a fucking dumb slut not worth a dime in PvP? no problem ! come to our AFK-fest in rated BG's !&quot;<br />
<br />
and then, everyone said : &quot;AWESOME !&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
oh god this expansion is gonna suck some humongous dicks -_-<br />
<br />
Oh, wow, you mean they're actually trying to go beyond PVP as being simply 2s, 3s, and 5s and actually trying to push focus back to BGs? Heaven forbid!<br />
<br />
I hope they'd get rid of Arena altogether so BGs would rule again, but this is a good start.<br />
<br />
First off, rated BGs means they aren't going to allow stuff as stupid as going afk during a BG. If you're going into a BG, you're going to have to work for it. Second, arena points are going to be minimal to prevent a grind-esque day of just BGing to get the same level of gear as a &quot;hardcore Arena master&quot;. Third, the rating sounds like it's designed to fight against others of your skill level, and not of anything related to Arena, so most likely, they're going to either make it not affect your PVP &quot;personal rating&quot; or it'll affect it in a minimal way. [maybe 100 point rating every week...not as much as Arena] If this is the case, it will take you a long time before you could get the best PVP gear in the game by simply BGing. You'll still get honor and arena points for getting good PVP gear, but it won't be as easy as it would be through Arena.<br />
<br />
In the very end, they're finally moving PVP to an area I've wanted it to go for a long time: Moving focus back onto BGs and trying to improve it so it's not &quot;forgotten.&quot; This is a good thing. It means they know that they need to make the game well-rounded on ALL areas of play.</div></div><hr />

I'm kinda wondering more about this &quot;Mastery&quot; system. Now, I get this part &quot;The old passive bonuses will be automatically added to your character through the Mastery system as you spend more points in a talent tree. Spending a lot of points in Fury will give you extra crit, etc ... this will be implemented for all classes.&quot;. <br />
<br />
but where does Mastery rating on items come in to play?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The way I understand it, Mastery will give an extra bonus to that 3rd passive stat in your most talented tree.<br />
<br />
I could be wrong though, but that's what I get out of it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Silarn</div><div class="date">2009-08-23, 07:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The BG system makes perfect sense to me. Nobody said they'd remove honor gains for doing smart things, like defending points.<br />
<br />
But when the BGs are rated, it works very similarly to Arenas. It's not really your personal performance that's rated, but whether you win or lose. Obviously doing smart things is conducive to WINNING, but you may simply be outmatched. This is true in Arenas, and I see it being equally true in BGs.<br />
<br />
Honor gains are a completely separate entity.</div></div><hr />

So eventually, you'll be able to choose whichever runes you want after you unlock them all, but you won't have them at the same time.<br />
<br />
Picture an warlock inscriptionist learning glyphs, but he can choose which glyphs he learns (no randomness). He begins by teaching himself &quot;Glyph of Haunt&quot;. He can now equip glyph of Haunt and get its benifit. He cannot unlearn this ever. Next week, he chooses &quot;Glyph of Fear&quot; to learn. Now he has a limited number of glyph slots (say 6). Eventually he'll have to pick and choose which he has equipped. Eventually he replaces his &quot;Glyph of Haunt&quot; with &quot;Glyph of Fear&quot; via the &quot;respeccing&quot;. He has not forgotten &quot;Glyph of Haunt&quot;, it is just not currently active.</div></div><hr />
