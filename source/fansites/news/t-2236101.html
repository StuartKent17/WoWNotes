Tier 20 Tuning, pre-Tomb of Sargeras<br />
Along with the launch of Patch 7.2.5 we are making tuning adjustments to a number of soon-to-be-available Tier 20 set bonuses. The target is as usual, relative power balance between Tier 20 set bonuses of different classes/specs and with the previous tier's set bonuses.<br />
<br />
Note that this is the round of Tier 20 tuning we're doing before Tomb opens, and we may make further adjustments as needed once Tomb opens and we have more live data.<br />

Havoc Discussions - 7.2.5 Mechanics and Feel<br />
Thank you for all the feedback, and apologies for the delayed response.<br />
<br />
We agree that there are moments of frustration with the live version of Demon Blades, and are continuing to look into how to address them, but also think that a smooth resource income is not the best solution.<br />
<br />
For Havoc, we wanted to create a style of play that used fewer core abilities in favor of having deeper gameplay in other areas (e.g. a higher reliance on movement and battlefield awareness, and higher variation in resource generation). Part of what makes Demon's Bite, a spammable resource generator, work for Havoc is that its interaction with Chaos Strike is not static. You need to monitor how much Fury it generates, and react with Chaos Strike when appropriate.<br />
<br />
We tried out having Demon Blades at 100% on the PTR mostly as a quality of life change, and to reduce the periods of time where players running Demon Blades found themselves unable to use any abilities. However, in practice, that change took an already simplified rotation and made it almost completely predictable. Though effective, it made the spec very dull to play. Reacting to your Fury bar is a core aspect of Havoc gameplay, and we don't want to lose that gameplay with Demon Blades.<br />
<br />
All that said, we still agree that the current version of Demon Blades is not perfect, and we will continue to iterate. The version we tried on the 7.2.5 PTR was just not the right direction for Havoc.</div></div><hr />

Basically they removed MoU from bear,then proceeded to make a raid with almost only physical tank damage with ToS,then they are nerfing magical tank damage in NH<br />
Making sure bears remain top tanks in all situations</div></div><hr />

Cause shadow is the counter part to retri. While retri always has to go live way too strong, shadow always has to feel like you are 20 ilevel behind all other dds. We are used to it...so why should they change it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dull? You mean moreso Dull than standing still in a fight because DB doesn't proc for a few Seconds? or dull like having to spam Demon's bite? at Least 100% DB gave some assurance that you were going to not be fury starved at times you needed the resources. DB just felt like a version of Rage like Warriors have. <br />
<br />
Hell I'd be happy with 100% generation without the bonus shadow damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ofc it does. According to Blizzard logic, everything that is predictable is dull, while everything that is walled by layers of RNG is fun and exciting. They been beating on that horse with loot for majority of WoW's life. Now its finally getting to other aspects of the game as well. Next stop: raid attunements requiring random world drops.</div></div><hr />

2pc: Rip generates 1 Energy (down from 2) when it deals damage.<br />
4pc: Rip deals 10% (down from 15%) increased damage and lasts 4 sec (down from 8 sec) longer.<br />
<br />
Jesus Christ... Okay, let's do some math.<br />
<br />
2 Piece Change:<br />
Going off a recent WarcraftLog, my Rip with 4,270 haste ticks every 1.08~ seconds. With rip ticking at 100% uptime, that equates to 1 extra shred every 37 seconds. Over the course of a 6 minute fight (M.Krosus is my reference), this gains you 9 extra shreds which for me would equate to approximately +5.1M~ damage. With my last parse i can see my Shreds totaled out to 36M, meaning the 2 piece would buff my Shred damage by 14.16% with the extra shreds gained...<br />
<br />
...if the T19 4 piece didn't already buff it and swipe by 15%. Meaning breaking your 4 piece for this 2 piece is a -0.84% drop in shred DPS and -15.00% on Swipe. Of course the bonus in primary/secondary stats might tip the scale for Shred, but this is a clear loss for us in terms of AoE. This works out to a -0.06% DPS upgrade<br />
<br />
4 Piece Change:<br />
I'm reluctant to complain about this one because +10% damage and +time on Rip is pretty much what makes us cats go round. But truthfully-- the +Damage bonus is the only bonus here that carries weight since Rip can be managed with 100% uptime with practice, buying an extra few seconds will be a great buffer however. The underlying problem here is that thanks to Jagged Wounds and 100% of ferals taking it, it's not 4 seconds, it's 2.4 seconds after the 33% tick speed reduction. This equates to +2 ticks of rip before needing to refresh. So the time bonus is actually not as nice as it seems as you get 2 globals during a window of time where you're typically pooling.<br />
<br />
Regardless, let's look at this one too. Same fight, i managed 66.31M in Rip damage as my #1. Tacking +10% onto it would result in another 6.6M damage (+ashamane rip damage, we'll say +25% uptime), bringing our bonus to about +8.2M [6.6M+1.6M] from the +10% damage. An overall DPS increase of 2.95%<br />
<br />
Abridged:<br />
2 Piece: Every 37~ seconds you gain +1 free shred through energy gains [+14.16%~ Shred DMG over a 6 minute fight] / T-19 4 Piece falls off, resulting in -15% Shred &amp; Swipe damage. You also lose CPs generated through Thrash by breaking your T19 2PC [0.06% overall DPS decrease]<br />
4 Piece: [2.95% overall DPS increase] / Your thrash no longer adds +5% damage through the 4 piece set bonus to +Shred/Swipe damage, your thrash also no longer generates combo points and will likely fall out of the rotation making the Luffa Wraps a less than optimal choice for the majority of encounters. <br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe next tier we'll get some cool shit, but it looks like we're being neutered back to ST / pisspoor AoE. Hold strong cat friends</div></div><hr />

That is called a Beta or Alpha. And unlike a PTR which anyone can access freely they are usually closed with WoW.</div></div><hr />
