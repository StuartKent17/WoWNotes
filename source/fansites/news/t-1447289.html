Garrosh Heirlooms and Bonus Rolls<br />
Many (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/january/garroshKiller.png) players (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/january/garroshKiller2.png) have asked about if it is possible to get a heirloom from a bonus roll, but @olandgren let us know (https://twitter.com/olandgren/status/427883052681793536) that you won't get heirlooms from a bonus roll. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Dampening Duration Change<br />
After some additional discussion, we've decided to make this change (5 minute Dampening) only apply in the 2v2 bracket. Dampening will remain at 10 minutes in 3v3 and 5v5 arenas.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lower Level Battleground Balance<br />
I had originally written here how World of Warcraft is a really big game, and while we know there are a lot of different types of activities outside of max-level content that people enjoy, we're not always going to be able to focus on each of them all of time. But it wasn't written particularly well and I feel like my points were probably fairly obvious to everyone.<br />
<br />
Anyway, in short: we will be address some low-level PvP balance in Warlords.<br />
<br />
First off it's worth noting the item squish. While individual brackets might not see a huge change, certainly the power curve between levels will be a smoother one. It'll have a bigger impact on world PvP as it'll be more like it was in vanilla, and relative power between characters won't see these dramatic swings. Back in the day even if you were 10, 20 or even 30 levels lower than someone else, you still had some shot at getting away, if not actually killing them. Of course as people start gearing up again that disparity will grow in the outdoor world, but it should be fun to get back to a smoother character power curve, and it'll at least always hold true for sub level-100 gank attempts. <br />
<br />
We recognize that low-level PvP balance just hasn't gotten the attention it needs, and that's largely due to us having to focus our attention on content that the majority of players focus their attention (e.g. max level). In Warlords we're going to be doing a bit of ability shuffling (read: deleting) which is going to result in the need to smooth out the ability-acquisition pacing (when you get a new ability and at what level), and we'll also be taking a pass on low-level balance at the same time. It's difficult because of the spread of people across all levels and ensuring every ability of every spec at any one particular level vs. another character/level/spec of another level have parity. Low level brackets just inherently bring a measure of un-balance with them due to the possible level difference, which is necessary to ensure they can fill up with enough players. Our goal is primarily to smooth out the outlying abilities - and this is hand-in-hand with the item squish - to ensure the base damage of all the abilities before scaling is appropriate. There are just some obvious tuning problems right now that we'll take care of, and then as much finer tuning as we can manage. We'll be looking for feedback during beta.<br />
<br />
I thought base damage was being abolished entirely, in favor of pure scaling. At least this was what I have heard elsewhere many times before this.<br />
There has to be something to scale from. <br />

Character / Items<br />
Will Legendary Cloaks be relevant in WoD? I hope so, I'm a little late to the party and don't want to get rid of it.<br />
Legendary cloaks will not stay relevant in WoD. You still have time to get plenty of use out of it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/422466537199378433))<br />
This makes me a sad panda.<br />
Think about what it would do during WoD. It would feel terrible to need to go back and do MoP raids in order to get them. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/422467680512118784))<br />
<br />
Art<br />
can you elaborate on these reasons please?some really dislike fist weapons for the same reason as people hating guns.<br />
Bow/gun thing was based 100% on audio issues (I know, weird &quot;solution&quot;), not visual/aesthetics. (Dave_Maldo (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/421006952131338240))<br />
<br />
Any chance of seeing strength fist weapons? My warrior would prefer to strap spikes to his fists and punch people.<br />
That would be awesome indeed. (Dave_Maldo (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/421006061504438272))<br />
<br />
The item for Hunters pets Kibler's Bits should last alot longer than a mere 5 minutes. Thank you!<br />
There was a push to keep class pet sizes &quot;reasonable&quot; (Monstrous Bite T_T) but 5 mins DOES seems short. Will try to look into! (Dave_Maldo (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/421005837432156160))<br />
<br />
I know lots of mages who would give their mouse arm for the broom to be permanent.<br />
Was discussed for Enchanting once or twice, but we're good w/ where it is, for now! (Dave_Maldo (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/421004059248582656))<br />
<br />
Any chance of Brazilian Carnival become a world event, with music and allegorical cars to show off each race of the game?<br />
That was proposed back when we were still making new, full-blown holiday events (Brewfest etc.). Who knows; maybe one day! (Dave_Maldo (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/421003852150624256))<br />
<br />
is there any chances for adding &quot;White&quot; items become transmogrifiable and even legendaries like illidan's blades?<br />
Very unlikely for the former; it's how many items they don't want unlocked are locked. Less so for the latter. (Dave_Maldo (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/420984569521664001))<br />
<br />
out of interest, why? What do you or we gain by this lockout mechanism for white items? struggling to think of any.<br />
The debate revolves around preserving a certain look &amp; feel in the world/player pop for &quot;real&quot; gear (vs fun temp costume). (Dave_Maldo (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/421003276645961729))<br />
<br />
Any chance for actual spectacles, such as the ones Lord Crowley wears, to be added to the game? As a transmog item maybe?<br />
Those totally SHOULD have been in the game by now, yeah. We even discussed SFK or on the shore or... anyhow, yes. Yes. (Dave_Maldo (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/421001178374082560))<br />
<br />
Will we ever be able to dye our gear? This is something I've wanted since we got transmorgryph.<br />
Maybe one day? Not planned for anytime soon though, sorry. (Dave_Maldo (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/421001404774248448))<br />
<br />
Old vid (http://t.co/0fVWGpyYNU), but still applies. -PLEASE- look into it, it has been years now.Iirc noggen scale down now too.<br />
Art mods wep sizes by type, both in-hand &amp; while sheathed, on a per race/gender basis in order to handle a HUGE range of assets. (Dave_Maldo (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/420987689102364672))<br />
Art does this to get weps in-hand as big as possible while still fitting theme and not creating terrible sheathed clipping issues. (Dave_Maldo (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/420988094678982656))<br />
<br />
Any chance of a moving sun and real-time shadows?<br />
The tech peeps love working on stuff like that when performance permits. Maybe one day! (Dave_Maldo (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/420984269729566720))<br />
<br />
With the new models in WoD, will it mean the end of tabards poking through capes when jumping etc?<br />
It'd be cool. Some clipping (in general) is practically unavoidable but I imagine they'll clean up as much as they can! (Dave_Maldo (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/420981710348484608))<br />

They go directly to a random raid members inventory (similar to LFR/Flexi loot).<br />
<br />
It's never a guaranteed drop, but (afaik) the first one will always be relevant to your current loot spec (when it does eventually drop).</div></div><hr />

For example, the weather-beaten fishing hat, which is a completely random drop from fishing daily caches, is the only transmoggable cloth hat with that brown appearance. There ARE, however, gray-quality brown cloth hats that share the exact same skin and model, but are gray, and therefore cannot be transmogged. That goes for many plate items as well. <br />

The main reason I think it's a bad idea is if buying your way to 90 becomes the norm in this game when you roll an alt.. what happens to the 1-90 content? What happens to 1-90 dungeon queues? Let's say 60% of people buy the boost when they start an alt, that means 60% less people are running 1-90 dungeons. What impact will this have on dungeon queues? It's already struggle to find healers and tanks for random dungeons. What will it be like when less people are running them?<br />
<br />
I just wish they'd make it easier to level up 1-90. Allow players to buy the full heirloom set and reduce the XP required in Wrath, Cata and Mist zones. I'd much rather players have an easier journey levelling up than get a level 90 gifted to them in seconds.</div></div><hr />

Nothing will happen. People will still level alts, only a small number of people will buy more then one boost to 90.<br />

thats kinda cool idea....<br />

Kind of agree, actually. Not a full-power scaled down Legendary, of course, but one on par with current heirloom weapons. Maybe just having it (or rather, the achievement) unlocks an heirloom version of it in the new heirloom tab they were mentioning they were working on?<br />

<br />
No you're not required but they are an invaluable way of learning how to play your class in a group. <br />
<br />
That's another reason why I dislike this instant level 90 ding idea... you'll have people running WoD dungeons who have no idea how to play their class in a dungeon. That means healers with access to a full set of spells but no idea of which heal to use in which situation.. or when to use heals and when to hold back due to threat. Tanks who will have no idea how to correct a bad pull. Lovely. <br />
<br />
It scares me to think there will be players rolling healers &amp; tanks for the very first time and immediately entering WoD dungeons as their first ever dungeon. Better get used to lots of wipes.. because it won't be pretty.</div></div><hr />

To be fair it might happen sometimes. But it won't be as common as that. Plus there are plenty of players who've played long term who still haven't got a clue how to play!</div></div><hr />

On my realm people say don't waste time to get the cloak now, because after you got it there will be not so much time to use.<br />
I hope in WOD they make a correct legendary weapon what can we transmog...<br />
I want my cloak transmog so badly because it didn't fit to my transmog gear... I didn't use it most of the time.<br />
<br />
I don't understand why blizzard destroyed the tank gameplay completely... waiting hours for a new tank in RF it shows everything...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rokkitan</div><div class="date">2014-01-28, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Imo all legendarys should work like a heirloom 1-90, since its so hard to obtain, with exception of cloak. Maybe that one unlocks after WOD launches so it can be sent to other toons.<br />
<br />
<br />
Making Legendaries like heirlooms sound like a nice idea, but keep them level-restricted. I.e. Legendary cloak (http://ptr.wowhead.com/item=102457#creates) is 1-90 when WoD is released, Val'anyr, Hammer of Ancient Kings (http://www.wowhead.com/item=46017) is 1-80 and Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros (http://www.wowhead.com/item=17182) is 1-60, and so on.<br />
<br />
Also please implement dyes so, so we can get access to old lfr variations of gear (Dragon Soul now and MoP when WoD is released) or have new hc (or normal/flex/valor) gear match current outfit. Perhaps we even can get access to existing but unused color variations of gear. Transmogrification has done much more for the game than I thought it would and is really awesome. Perhaps even make transmogrification cheaper so we change more often.</div></div><hr />

I think they have a problem with introducing recolouring anyway.... LFR/Flex/Normal/Heroic versions of the same gear have different colours so you can see which version it is. How would that work if you could change it?<br />

<br />
I agree this will make running those dungeons harder..... but that's just like finding people doing Isle of Thunder, or queue times for LFRs apart from current tier. The only reason anyone is in them at all is for legendary quest items most of the time. My point is that this happens even at max level with max level zones. Its just &quot;how it is&quot;. So a result of boosting to 90 will mean its harder to stand in a city and queue dungeons to level.... I don't consider this a bad thing tbh, that had to be the most boring way to level in the first place. Either get out there and quest (its still VERY quick) or buy a boost (of course we don't know the price of this yet).</div></div><hr />

This is of course the ground issue here. On high-pop servers I can see this being a minor issue, but with leveling as fast as it is now with heirlooms...<br />

Just means they get a 90 with crap gear and professions, big deal. I am sure Blizz is not going to give them everything on a silver platter, they will have to do the research shit just like we did.

&quot;Low level zones will be dead and dungeon times will sky-rocket!&quot; No, your mistake is in thinking EVERYONE is going to be buying 90s. They aren't. You'll still see just as many people in those zones and queuing for those dungeons as you do now.<br />
<br />
&quot;EVERYONE WILL GET MAX PROFS!!&quot; No, the only time a character gets it's professions boosted is if it is already at level 60 or above before you boost it to 90.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll have a bunch of idiots that don't know how to play at max level now!&quot; No, you already have masses of players like that as it is. You'll see no difference. Boosted players will also have to complete something like the DK Starter area so they can be taught at least the basics of the class they boosted. 90 will also not be the max level for very long.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's PAY2WIN because you get max level!&quot; No, you're getting max level at the very END of an expansion. You've won precisely fuck all. Max level being 90 won't even be a thing for much longer.<br />
<br />
Not to mention so far all they are doing is testing the feature. Which I might add is something people have actually been asking for for a while now. Maybe not the chronic QQers on this website but I can assure you people have. And it isn't just &quot;casual&quot; players. People also forget that not everybody even buys the expansion. MoP started with what, 10million players? How many copies did MoP sell? I can almost promise you it wasn't 10million...</div></div><hr />

Buy WoD get 1 free 90<br />
Buy from store get as many 90's<br />
Must have WoD to buy 90?<br />
<br />
Sigh this is bad ... very bad...<br />
<br />
Also bliz made a point few months ago about lvling, they still wanted people to lvl and experiance 1-80 zones and what not and not just blow zones up and bam 90.. guess that went out the window.<br />
<br />
Hopefully its more like. buy x90s.. (like 1 more or 2 more) thats it.</div></div><hr />

Not only that your are gonna get level 90 for cash but also this character will be with both professions of your choosing leveled to max. If it's not Pay to Win then i'm still a virgin. Other players with don't have cash to buy such stuff (because they already pay every month for subscription) can go and F*** themselves. <br />

How does it stand as a &quot;Pay to Win&quot;?! What are you &quot;winning&quot;?! Jack-sh*t, that's what you win. You save up a couple of days to level up a character and that is all. I can't see how that is &quot;instant win&quot; in your oppinion. The level cap is pushed 10 levels higher so even lvl 90 chars ain't max level and the proffs are as of now maxable within a couple k gold with buying mats from the AH. Stop whining and stop with this &quot;can't afford the paid 90 so it is an insta-win&quot; attitude. If someone has extra money they are willing to spend that's fine. I don't see anything wrong with it. I've leveled so many characters over the past years and the leveling content is a joke nowadays with dungeon farming and heirlooms so what is the big deal? Live and let live people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I keep hearing is jealousy that YOU had to slog through the leveling process but someone else doesn't have to. Well suck it up, procrastination PAYS, especially with MMOs.<br />
<br />
I waited to do the legendary questline and they dropped the valor needed to 3000. Yay for me!<br />
<br />
Now, as for the point about boosting professions. If you haven't realized it yet, professions will be DEAD in the next expansion.<br />
The new Garrison feature will allow people to have access to ANY profession they need.<br />
If you go look at the announcements from Blizzcon you can the foundation of this.<br />
<br />
So, for all those worried that this profession boost will cut into your gold profits...Sorry the garrisons will affect it WAY more.<br />
<br />
If you paid attention, the Tiller farm was the first step of this. It allowed characters access to ore without a miner, herbs without an herbalist, leather without a skinner.<br />
<br />
The next logical step is to allow characters access to craft things without having a max level Blacksmith, etc.<br />
The game has been steadily moving toward a self sustaining model for each individual character. Long gone are the days with one Blacksmith in your guild supplying gear for several characters.<br />

<br />
I would LOVE to see millions of 90s. My entire guild quit back in Cataclysm, if this gets even 10% of them back I will be extremely happy.<br />
<br />
I don't see how this is a bad thing to bring people BACK to the game? AND if you think this will force people to leave then maybe the game didn't need THOSE people anymore?</div></div><hr />

What are you talking about? you want it easier but you dont want it instant, rofl so you are OK with them giving u faster leveling witch is also SKIPING A LOT OF CONTENT instead just buying instant 90,you really need to think before you write man.<br />
Its not like now people with heirlooms and what not dont skip content hell you only maybe do 1-2 zones in full , less you skip or do 3-5 quests ,do dungeons THERE IS ALLREADY HUGE SKIPING in content so no point in not adding instant 90,its the best option. <br />
Some say its blizzard laziness for not making questing more fun,instead they go easy way with instant 90 thats fine too,but i bet all people that say instant 90 is bad , gonna buy at least 2-3 characters,hell i know i will.</div></div><hr />

This is pay to win. But everyone in WoW has different opinions on what Pay 2 Win actually means.

The point is, for example, Bob is rich and spends many hours a day on WoW. Bob can just buy his way to level 90. Skipping like 90% of the actual content.

John cannot buy a level 90, John must grind all low level content for weeks until he finally reaches level 100, meanwhile... Bob already has multiple level 90's and 100's with barely any effort.<br />

See what I'm trying to say? This is pay to win. Besides, this is a pathetic band-aid solution to &quot;fix&quot; the so-called leveling (which is a joke by itself anyway).

Leveling is only 10% of the game..<br />
People fail to realize how many hours played they have at MAX level instead of while leveling, pretty sure time played on a max character means more than on a character thats gaining 2-3 levels per hour. Cmon now, all this &quot;Rant&quot; is crying over spilt milk that really has no purpose. So what people can buy a 90 or two if they feel like it, how does this affect you personally? Again, this game isnt about leveling and it hasn't been in a long time. It's getting to max level, then raiding/pvp/achievements/old raids, thats the focus of the current game. If you cant get aboard then get off this train, no one will miss you.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shudder</div><div class="date">2014-01-28, 05:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I plainly don't give a shit on this whole free level 90 deal. A lot of people I know at the beginning of MoP were bitching and moaning endlessly about having to level all 9 of their alts to level 90 as well and complaining about how its too much of Blizz to ask of the player to have to do that. Yet now people are coming out of the woodwork and complaining that this is going to turn the game into pay to win and enforce catering to the casual.<br />
<br />
None of that even matters to me, all I know is that philosophy behind the development stands in good reasoning and I'm not going to let anyone else's opinion affect this.<br />
<br />
Leveling from 1-90 is not 70% of the game, if at all, currently, its 10% of the game, when WoD comes out, it'll be 9% of the game. If you want to see numbers, please take a look at your /played time while at level max level and compare it to your times spent at each level while leveling and tell me that, even while added up, your time spent leveling is equal to or greater than your time spent at max level.<br />
<br />
Here's an idea! Get rid of 1-90 content. That was simple right? I mean they're saying it's such a hassle for us to get where we want to be and play end game with our friends. Will they squeeze extra money out of our tits this way? Of course not. Imo keep it the way it is or remove the whole damn thing. People with money shouldn't get an advantage in the game. (Yes paying to skip weeks worth of content while the poor have to sludge through it is an advantage)</div></div><hr />

I meant leveling content. Instant 90 means you're skipping 90% of all the zones, quests, and leveling stuff. Etc.<br />

No. I've got a right to voice my opinion just like everyone else, whether that be positive or negative. I'm just an extremely disappointed customer who paid for all the expansions + monthly sub, and yet Blizzard still manages to pull shit like this through while the &quot;Shop&quot; buttons that are in-game are just screaming at you to buy their stuff.

<br />
/rantover<br />
Your analogy is flawed.<br />
First of all, Bob plays for long enough that he would have been more likely to level his toons. He'd also have put effort into getting his level 100s.<br />
<br />
If John can barely afford his subscription, why is he playing? He is obviously struggling for money if he can only just manage £9/$15 once a month. He could put that money to much better use. He shouldn't even be looking at the store if he can barely keep his subscription going. If anything, he's getting his money's worth from going from 1-90/100 and would feel accomplished because he did everything.<br />
<br />
These two guys are also likely never even going to hear about each other. Neither one affects the other. It's not P2W.<br />
There is also the fact that less people than you imagine will even buy a level 90. Altoholics generally prefer to level, such as myself. I've been leveling since Vanilla, I'm not gonna stop now lol Even if I am pretty sick of doing the same shit over and over.<br />
<br />
I do agree though, leveling should be improved so that people actually want to do it rather than skip it. But I can also see people like me with many alts that would hate to go through the same old shit again. You have to remember that this wasn't really aimed at people that already play to start with, it was for new/returning players so that they could play with their friends or just get to current content.<br />
<br />
Or am I just a fanboy? Or perhaps the blind fool?</div></div><hr />

I.e. Legendary cloak is 1-90 when WoD is released, Val'anyr, Hammer of Ancient Kings is 1-80 and Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros is 1-60, and so on.<br />
<br />
They are legendaries for a reason. You have them at current content and if same expansion normally last into the next few patches (i.e Val'anyr still used in ICC) due to the procs or equip bonuses. Having Val'anyr's bubble from 1-80 would be overpowered and walk over current heirlooms. Think about battlegrounds. I don't even do pvp, but just an example.<br />
<br />
Yes the cloak Legendary and Val'anyr were not just your &quot;drop chance&quot; loot. Yes you can argue with Val, but still had todo a quest chain and not just loot the items. You had to do a quest chain lasting a good month or 2 (depending on drop chances) for the cloak and when rewarded with it, it was earned. It also offered something each patch during the progression, Sha Gem &gt; Socket &gt; Meta etc. This was a good &quot;experiment&quot; and did reward the people who took effort in. Now that content is &quot;easier&quot; then before as people &quot;pug&quot; with Flexi (pretty much its role) to get the new Garrosh looms, where as before you didnt make a casual sunday pug to get the glaives. Doing the cloak quest rewarded you. Having the Garrosh looms are a reward as you are killing the currently last boss in the game. There will not be a reward for using them at the current content as this is the last patch so using them next expansion will be the reward. I do agree with the cloak however, but due to the rewards each completion of the chain during each patch was reward enough I think.<br />
<br />
TLDR - Use legendaries at current content. Be grateful with their OP'ness at current. Not Blizzard's fault you get them 2 expansions later. They are legendary for a reason.</div></div><hr />

First of all, Bob plays for long enough that he would have been more likely to level his toons. He'd also have put effort into getting his level 100s.<br />
<br />
If John can barely afford his subscription, why is he playing? He is obviously struggling for money if he can only just manage £9/$15 once a month. He could put that money to much better use. He shouldn't even be looking at the store if he can barely keep his subscription going. If anything, he's getting his money's worth from going from 1-90/100 and would feel accomplished because he did everything.<br />
<br />
These two guys are also likely never even going to hear about each other. Neither one affects the other. It's not P2W.<br />
There is also the fact that less people than you imagine will even buy a level 90. Altoholics generally prefer to level, such as myself. I've been leveling since Vanilla, I'm not gonna stop now lol Even if I am pretty sick of doing the same shit over and over.<br />
<br />
I do agree though, leveling should be improved so that people actually want to do it rather than skip it. But I can also see people like me with many alts that would hate to go through the same old shit again. You have to remember that this wasn't really aimed at people that already play to start with, it was for new/returning players so that they could play with their friends or just get to current content.<br />
<br />
Or am I just a fanboy? Or perhaps the blind fool?<br />
<br />
Yeah you are sick of doing the same shit over and over - but you done it and fair play to you. Now someone can come along and completely devalue all the effort you have put in simply because he has more money than sense. Stop defending the indefensible - this shit has no place in a pay to play MMO. Every one in the world of warcraft should be equal and outside factors should not influence those inside the game.</div></div><hr />

He plays only a few hours a day, sometimes even less, and has no heirlooms. While Bob plays at least 5 hours every day.<br />
<br />
John cannot buy a level 90, John must grind all low level content for weeks until he finally reaches level 100, meanwhile... Bob already has multiple level 90's and 100's with barely any effort.<br />
<br />
See what I'm trying to say? This is pay to win.<br />
<br />
This is not an example of pay to win lol. Its not Blizzard's fault John doesnt have as much money as Bob. What if John was as rich as Bob? Wouldnt he spend as much money?<br />
<br />
This is what happened to me. I started in Oct 06. I think I was about 16/17. I was at College. Now im 25 and have a paying job. Before if I wanted to play on another server, I would have to start a whole new character because I didnt have X amount to blow on a server transfer. Now I xfer/faction change multiple chars at once. I think ive spent almost £3k on character services. So technically I was John, but now im Bob?<br />

Ermm.. no. Some random person I'll never even know exists has no effect on the fact that I leveled with quests from 1-90. My experience, effort and even time still have the same value they had back then. Nothing changes.<br />
<br />
This is like when people QQ about people being able to get raid titles 2 expansions later. The fact you got it when it was current is still a great thing to have done. You're now sporting the latest title/mount while most people won't get it for another 2 expansions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you are greatly overestimating how much people l2p at below max level. With Heirlooms, players can put three buttons on their bar and zoom through all the previous expansions content without any problems. You can three man most dungeons, and the only real chance of a wipe is when a hunter/lock pet bugs out and pulls half the dungeon (LBRS, UBRS and Dire Maul come to mind if you drop down). <br />
<br />
Players learn to play at max level. Getting to 90 in a game where max level is 100 does nothing but save that person about 2-3 weeks of leveling.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">varkar</div><div class="date">2014-01-28, 07:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, according to the official infographic*:<br />
<br />
670,000 PvP instances/day versus 900,000 PvE instances/day done by WoW players.<br />
<br />
* http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/12346804/world-of-warcraft-azeroth-by-the-numbers-1-28-2014<br />
<br />
So much for PvP being minor, and that is even despite with far less XP/hour from it at most levels, high imbalances at most levels, etc.<br />
<br />
Why do I say &quot;at most levels&quot; rather than repeating the usual mantra that only max level matters?<br />
<br />
Here is something not shown in the infographic but as important:<br />
<br />
Around 40% to 50% of characters online at a time are under maximum level.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
That can easily be proven:<br />
<br />
Go to any realm, most conveniently a low to medium population realm: Type /who, then do a search entering:<br />
<br />
&quot;warrior&quot; 1-89<br />
<br />
followed by<br />
<br />
&quot;warrior&quot; 90<br />
<br />
and likewise for other classes. If there are 50 results seen, the number found reached its cap, not giving an actual figure.<br />
<br />
But if both figures are under 50, as often so on a low or medium population realm, then the data is meaningful. <br />
<br />
Compare the results then: <br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
What gets seen: There are around as many people playing at a time under max level as at max level.<br />
<br />
Presently, leveling is near half the game to the total average of the playerbase.<br />
<br />
Not very long after they reach max level, get every ability for their class, have done raids one to a few times through on LFR, and so on, many players simply consider themselves done and quit or else level an alt on another class (if any desired not already done yet), rather than Blizzard's ideal of running again the same already-seen content on other difficulties.<br />
<br />
Once WoD's level boosts hit live, and 90 levels of PvE content drop off the to-do list for many players, to be replaced by 10, Blizzard really better hope PvP keeps up playtime. Sure, someone could artificially choose to still level manually, but it'd be harder to really do if knowing that all those hours could be substituted for by merely a few bucks without the slightest ban risk in the process.</div></div><hr />

So not only do you allow people to puchase level boosts from 1 to 90 but you totally screw over people who have already made an effort to level a toon. Leveling professions is a joke and its very sad that they would think that they could justify the cost of making people who pay to boost a lvl 1 to 90 x ammount and then charge people who want to boost from lvl 60,70,80 etc.. to 90 the same ammount and think they are making it worth our while by throwing in a leveled profession. I'm sorry that is a horrible model for the consumer. Take your instant lvl 90 boost cost and divide it by 90 and charge users per level. So I only need 5 or 10 more levels to go and I dont want to grind them out I can pay per level. Having to pay the same cost as a 1 to 90 boost is horrible. Please fix this!!</div></div><hr />

I'm just seeing a tantrum here ... firstly &quot;Bob is rich&quot; Doesn't matter, it would be his money to do with as he pleases. Be it on a game or not, Secondly &quot;John has barely enough money for his subscription&quot; means John shouldn't even be playing the game if he is that poor. When you are so tight for money you can barely afford the game or need someone else to pay for you, means you shouldn't even have a subscription.<br />
<br />
Another thing wrong with your tirade here, even if you play at least a dedicated 2 hours a day without heirlooms leveling is not that hard. Getting to max level should not take &quot;weeks&quot; unless you aren't trying or do not care enough to reach max level as quickly as possible. Just because someone &quot;Buys&quot; a level 90 doesn't mean they instantly win the game. Far from it, it just means they don't have to level through the same content they have seen numerous times before. It also means they will wear down the new content even faster. <br />
<br />
People who love to level, will likely not buy a 90, those who hate leveling, care only for end game content, want to play with their friends, etc are the ones who will likely use this feature and it is their right to do so. You people whine too much about things like this. Yes I understand it frustrates you and those who feel like you but whining, complaining, shouting, stamping your feet, ranting and throwing childish tantrums on this forum or any other is not going to do you a damn bit of good. <br />
<br />
Majority wins and &quot;voting&quot; with your money about &quot;not wanting a feature?&quot; Not going to do you a bit of good. For every person that quits because the shop added new stuff, just gives Blizzard more of a reason to add even more stuff to the store to make up for the loss of subscriptions.

I disagree. I'd much rather transfer a character than lose it's professions/money/loot.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
I meant leveling content. Instant 90 means you're skipping 90% of all the zones, quests, and leveling stuff. Etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Crying? Hahahahahaha... oh my, that's funny.<br />
<br />
No. I've got a right to voice my opinion just like everyone else, whether that be positive or negative. I'm just an extremely disappointed customer who paid for all the expansions + monthly sub, and yet Blizzard still manages to pull shit like this through while the &quot;Shop&quot; buttons that are in-game are just screaming at you to buy their stuff. Ah, the shop buttons. That's another matter that I shall not go into now. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
How original. /clap<br />
<br />
I love how you say everyone has a right to voice their opinion, yet in your original post you insult anyone who has a differing opinion than your own.<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't care what anyone else does. I don't play this game to compete with others on who has the most 90s. I've already leveled 13 characters to max (never had the money to server transfer) so when my friends/guild/etc would switch servers I'd just level up a new one. So I've got multiple of the same class at max level and frankly never want to level again. This new system is great for me now that I have a decent amount of disposable income. It gives next to no advantage for raiding/pvp (other than giving you more options, but almost any class is as viable as any other for doing max level content).<br />
<br />
You don't like it? That's fine. I don't see any problem with it. It doesn't fall into my belief of pay2win.</div></div><hr />

Yes we should. So borded people who only play for loot instead of enjoying the content will buy their set, see how bored they now are and leave for good.<br />

<br />
Yes, it matters a whole lot. If they do this they NEED, repeat: NEED, to make everyone start at 55 and not this 1 crap. Start at 55 or 60 and be done with it, starting at 1 does nothing but turn people away from the game, and start at 55-60 would retain many more people. Leveling blows as-is.

it's funny how they made stuff so much of a grind early on, and didnt want to make new dungeons cause it would &quot;invalidate the gearing process&quot;, and then all of a sudden there is an isle where loot rains from the sky.<br />

in any case, if everyone buys a 90 we're going to see even worse LFRs in the future. it's bad enough already with people queuing up in ungemmed/unenchanted isle gear, now we have that plus people who dont even know their class. :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
I imagine they did that because it's nearing the end of the expansion and they want people to be able to experience all the content. If I remember correctly in past expansions once the new expansion had hit beta they would begin decreasing the difficulty of all the raids, so this is a different method to the same result.<br />
<br />
Sure you might get some people who don't know their class in LFR, but I think it's wrong to assume that they will automatically be bad. Keep in mind that people are still going to have to level these characters up to level 100. On top of that there is nothing that distinguishes a bad player with a free 90 and a bad player that leveled their character to 90. If they are the type of person who is going to be a good/useful raider they will have those atributes regardless of how they got their character. I have a friend that thought it was fun to level a warlock with almost nothing but drain life. He's a great player, Once he got to 90 he looked carefully at the spells, did some reading and research and did just fine in raids. People are making this far too black and white.</div></div><hr />

If this Pay-for-level-90 option ends up going ahead, it will be the final nail in the coffin for me, confirming I never take it up again and seek out 'greener pastures' elsewhere. Blizzard will have started down the extremely slippery slope of 'pay-to-win'. It may be 'only' Pay for 90 now, eventually it may very well end up being 'Pay for Level 100' or &quot;Level 1-100 heirlooms with 20% experience boost, &quot;only&quot; $19.95&quot; <br />
<br />
This sounds a lot like the &quot;gay marriage will lead to people marrying their dogs&quot; type argument, just hysteria for now reason. Players getting a character to level 90 when the max is 100 is pretty far from Play to Win. And if this was enough to get you to leave, why didn't you get all angry about RAF which allows you to boost characters in days to max level. That's been around for years. Or character transfers? Again thats' been around for years.<br />
<br />
90% of this game takes place at max level, and leveling is just a useless timesink at this point, especially for those who have already done it before.</div></div><hr />

I find this faux anger over something that in no way affects the type of people who are &quot;angry&quot; pretty hilarious.<br />

The reason I did not &quot;get angry&quot; about the RAF setup is because despite the fact that you were levelling at a faster rate, it was not simply a case of &quot;type in a credit card number, click OK, BOOM! You're 10 levels short of cap!&quot; You still had to experience most of the game. You still had to progress through the content rather than simply skipping literally 90% of the build-up to end-game.<br />
<br />
Also Character Transfers are something COMPLETELY different altogether and should not even be compared to this. The person levelled the character, they experienced the content, all it is, is akin to shifting a folder to another directory in another computer on the network.<br />
<br />
Also your comparing my comment to a comments about gay marriage is like comparing an apple to an atomic bomb. TOTALLY different things and an absolutely ridiculous 'comparison'. What I was saying and that you apparently overlooked is the fact that it is a VERY slippery slope - they have already shown in past articles posted HERE in MMO-Champion that they are not against allowing people to drop cash for things that give tangible in-game benefits, such as EXP boost elixirs (something common in free-to-play micro-transaction games), so what is to stop them making it so people can drop $20 for 5000 valor points or $40 for an ilvl 600 bind-to-account weapon eventually?<br />
<br />
Lastly, you call levelling a &quot;mindless timesink&quot;? I'd call raiding an even bigger timesink, moreso because you spend hundreds of hours smashing your head against a virtual brick wall (or in the case of LFR, sitting semi-afk hitting a couple of buttons every so often) only to have the gear you picked up become obsolete a couple of months later when the next patch comes out.<br />

Enjoy your Skinner box. I'll be out enjoying the fresh air and enjoying my job and the company of my loved ones.</div></div><hr />

Then each expansion should default new characters to the level it starts at. Buy the game today all your characters start at level 85. Once WoD hits new characters all start at 90. And so on. Let's stop taking half measures here. I'd be willing for there to be a checkbox to start at level 1 that you have to opt-into, with maybe an extra character-specific title &quot;The Stubborn&quot; or &quot;The Old school&quot; or even &quot;The Legit&quot; etc.<br />

Very interesting, thanks! So basically my old GM who quit suddenly two hours before MOP launched after announcing he hated Pandas could come back for WOD and it'd basically be like he just had worse starting gear than I do. Kinda puts the entire expansion and treadmill into perspective.</div></div><hr />

Definitely does. 2 levels or so and he would be on par with you save a BoA weapon off Garrosh. If you ignore that, it's less demoralizing. I've been trying to justify why I've done this for 8 years now.</div></div><hr />
