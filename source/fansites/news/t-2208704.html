Anecdotal evidence, but the previous Nexus Challenge brought in a new of fresh meat. Quite a few have been hanging on since then.</div></div><hr />

Well, the teaser was about this great beast coming to the game, with such a revamp we could see a big hero incoming, like Deathwing, but nope.<br />
<br />
I understand why they did it, it's because that was the only way of getting people to pay attention and actually watch the stream.</div></div><hr />

This is essentially why I am quite (read: very) salty.<br />
<br />
I don't mind D'Va being in the game. I expected her to come out fairly soon due to leaked files. I even wanted another OW character to fill up their roster to get them on par with Diablo and Starcraft.<br />
<br />
What I am salty about is their stupid, ill-conceived red herring of a &quot;teaser&quot;. When you see 10 foot long claw marks on the shimada gates as though saying &quot;fuck these two dragons&quot;, you would expect the next reveal to be some huge bestial bastard who's ready to fuck shit up. The growl alongside it lent credence to this line of thinking too.<br />
<br />
Nope, it's a girl in a mech. Well, alright, GG Blizz, your teaser did nothing to convey that it would have been D'Va. Might as well have forgone releasing the teaser to begin with and setting the expectations high. Everyone in the Twitch chat thought it would be Deathwing or a feral druid or something along those lines.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those claws are Diablo's. The growl is diablo, at most I half expected Hanzo, when I saw DVA I was like okay this is cool.<br />
<br />
The very fact the map with genji was Hanamura instantly said that it was an OW character coming. Which one was hard to tell. I had bets on Hanzo and the Shimada brothers together. I spent the trailer waiting for Ryuu ga waaga teki..</div></div><hr />

Every time I've gone back to do one of their events (like unlocking Cho'gall or doing the Nexus Challenge) there have been plenty of players and it was really easy to find groups in /reddit and /nexuschallenge. It certainly seems to have a dedicated playerbase. Obviously it can't (and shouldn't even attempt to) compete with Dota 2 and League in terms of playerbase, but as a more casual / innovative MOBA for Blizzard fans, it's fun to jump into from time to time.<br />
<br />
Personally, it kind of dropped off my radar around the time I got into the Overwatch closed beta. I was playing it quite frequently before that. Ultimately it was hard for me to keep up with new hero releases as a F2P player, and with no real way to earn cosmetics and the high price of new heroes I just lost interest. I got really good with Kael'thas and eventually unlocked his Master Skin, and at that point it sort of felt like I &quot;beat the game&quot; and I just didn't feel like playing anymore.<br />
<br />
The 2.0 progression changes are exactly the kind of changes that are going to get me to jump back in. Not sure if it'll maintain my interest, because I already have so many &quot;games as services&quot; games that I need to log into and play every few days to keep up with... but if they keep doing crossover events, I'll definitely keep diving in to unlock the rewards for other games I play.<br />
<br />

Do we have items and personal hero level system yet?<br />
No, alright, no thank you<br />
HotS not having those things is exactly why I play it. Doing the exact same thing as Dota 2 and League would just be a recipe for failure.</div></div><hr />

Went on today, definitely sparked my interest again, the level system is awesome. Probably won't go back to playing it a crap ton, but I'll throw a few hours into it a week I think. When I don't feel like playing WoW.<br />
<br />
Was awesome getting a bunch of free stuff though :P Even if you don't plan on playing it, go in and get the free stuff. Opening chests are always fun.</div></div><hr />

Except idiots on reddit lunged onto the rumours of Deathwing coming to the game. Maybe you people should stop hyping yourself up at literally every announcement, it would help greatly<br />

I tried doing the 15 for the genji in November and couldnt. The WoW mount looked cool enough that I was able to grind it out but darn I'd rather have my teeth pulled. Somehow, the 5 games this time around felt even worse. The player base is terrible. The maps and objectives are haphazard. The characters are just fan service. It's sad to see Blizzard keeps having to do these promotions to bring people like myself over but what they dont realize is that, unless the experience is fun, we (the skeptical player) will knock out the 5 rounds and uninstall. Not a good recipe for growing a game</div></div><hr />

<br />
Won't that just drive people away?<br />
<br />
I doubt Blizzard cares about the player experience right now. They probably just want to use this event to artificially boost the active player count to fool investors into thinking the game is still worth their time. I'm surprised they've managed to keep it alive this long and the new loot box system is an obvious attempt at trying to salvage some kind of profitability from the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Clearly you don't know how it works then. The loot boxes in total would lose them out on money, because we're getting for free what a lot of people would spend money on. Instead of having to pay for skins, we just get them from loot boxes you can get easily for free.<br />

<br />
That price for skins is the norm in Mobas, it's just how the game is funded. Purely cosmetic items. Some skins definitely take more than 3 people doing 4 days of work, but a lot sure wouldn't take much work. That's just how Mobas work. It's the genre. Pay to look pretty.</div></div><hr />

It's such bullshit they are calling it 2.0. All they did was change the rewards system to be like Overwatch's, and add an Overwatch map with more Overwatch characters, with no change in how the game functions.<br />

The reason people aren't playing your game isn't because they weren't getting enough rewards, or that they don't have enough characters to play, or that they don't have enough maps to play on.</div></div><hr />

The reason people aren't playing your game isn't because they weren't getting enough rewards, or that they don't have enough characters to play, or that they don't have enough maps to play on.<br />
<br />
Nah the reason people aren't playing is because the game is shit lol. Having more characters, maps and rewards won't change that. <br />
<br />
The game is a fan-service that players get railroaded into if they want skins/mounts/whatever for the games they do enjoy.</div></div><hr />

This game is so bad. They are using models from their other games. There is no real work behind it, only the skins. But 10$ for one skin? WTF? It is maximum 3 people's 4 days work. <br />
I will not understand MOBA-s: same map over and over and over again. The match making is 30mins and the game is 1 hour long at least...<br />

Not necessarily. Them giving you some free stuff is like giving a free sample. Your brain makes the connection that it likes opening crates. That is y they give you 7 free EPIC crates that contains at least 1 epic item. It creates a feeling of &quot;opening these boxes makes me feel good&quot; Playing isn't giving enough to satisfy that feeling. Have to buy MORE!</div></div><hr />

You can only play against the AI the first week iirc. From there on it's Quick Match, Unranked or Ranked.</div></div><hr />

It's so funny to see people talking about Activision-Blizzard as an investment when they clearly know nothing about it. Blizzard doesn't give HoTS player counts to investors. Last I checked, they don't even announce the active player time of HoTS either. They don't announce how much money HoTS makes, whether it has gone up or down, or really anything HoTS-related in their quarterly reports (except a bullet point here or there like &quot;we had our annual Heroes of the Dorm tournament last month&quot;). You are grasping by trying to claim they made any change related to the game because of investors.<br />
<br />
Now, clearly they changed the loot system to try to increase revenues from the game. I will give you that. The added sprays, voice lines, announcers, etc. will cause collectors (or &quot;whales&quot;) to spend more money to get them all. Now whether that is to increase the profits they are already making on the game, or to recover losses from declining players, no one but people at Blizzard can say right now. HoTS has a very dedicated base, and it's in Blizzard's best interest to try to increase that base, even if they know they will never achieve the same player base as LoL.</div></div><hr />

It's just made up by someone who doesn't actually play the game. AI has multiple difficulty modes and has been there since launch. Nothing is happening to it. You get XP and currency slightly slower, but if you play with others and play on higher difficulty so the matches take a normal amount of time it's not bad.

<br />
<br />
I doubt changing the system from them earning more money to them earning less money is &quot;profitable&quot;<br />
<br />
There's a reason most games are going to the loot box system (referred to as the &quot;gacha&quot; system in the East). The system usually ends up making the business more money in the end (similar to MMORPGs going F2P).<br />

<br />
Every investor call they report both Audience Reach metrics, referred to as Monthly Active Users (MAUs), and Deep Engagement metrics, measured by Hours Played. They report the overall number as well as the specific games that did exceedingly well that quarter. You can bet your ass they'll mention HoTS on the next investor call if there's a massive boost to either of those metrics because of the new system (although I wouldn't count on it happening, I think this is more a move of desperation rather than a tactical one).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Irian</div><div class="date">2017-04-28, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really do feel like this is a huge improvement to HotS, personally. As someone who's always liked the game but never quite loved it, I always felt like it was strongly held back by its overkill on nickel-and-diming of its playerbase combined with an extremely poor and barebones reward system that, summed up, was pretty much &quot;You can't do shit except unlock more heroes with this gold and you won't be able to do it any sensible pace. If you want 10 heroes after 3 months of playing them have fun, otherwise pay up, sucker.&quot; <br />
<br />
The new reward system is fun and relatively harmless, and better yet, weekly hero rotations and new hero releases are a huge deal now with each level up giving a box. Even better, the later levels on heroes have smoothed out to a decent pace even at the high levels (A solid 6 games or so got my level 20 Abathur up a level, whereas before it was giving something like a fiftieth of a level) so you're not really deincentivized from playing your main, but more just incentivized to play heroes you're not familiar with or have never played.<br />
<br />
Overall I approached this with jaded boredom with the game and was extremely surprised with how much fun I've been having. Loot box obtained skins have me playing heroes I previously didn't care for only to find that they've been revamped since I last played, or try new ones entirely I wouldnt've otherwise looked at. The game's progression system has me excited for games, win or loss.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And you would have noticed too that very cleary there are still people playing even when there are no active events if you had played when there are no active events. I can't say I'm a regular hots player myself, in fact I haven't had much time to play anything at all really, but I can defenitely say that with or without events I pretty much never had trouble playing quick match, unranked or league with reasonable queue times, independetly of what most people were doing in the chat.<br />
<br />
Your personal experience, and especially your perception, do not necessarily equal to actual facts in the grand scheme of things.<br />
<br />
Obviously during events the majority of activity will be around the event, especially in the visible side of things (chat), just like in WoW there's mostly talk and buzz about the latest and active patch and content, the latest raid, etc etc. Just because you don't see people looking for Wailing Cavern runs doesn't mean they don't happen.<br />
<br />
Same translates to HotS; just because &quot;all&quot; you see in the chat is quick games agaisnt AI doesn't mean that is the only thing that's happening.<br />
<br />
<br />
Granted, it defenitely is an attempt to increase player pool and by proxy profits, there's no doubt about that. Everyone does it one way or another, especially when you are competing with much larger and previously well established products such as LoL and Dota, and in an overall over-saturated genre as MOBA is. The question here is that you only see it as &quot;desperate&quot; because you likely have a negative bias towards the game and seeing (or believing) it fail quite possibly gives you a feeling of validation of your dislike of the game in the first place, no?<br />
<br />
Either way, it's clear and obvious HotS is far, far away from LoL &amp; Dota numbers, but no, people don't play JUST because of the cross-game events, and the game doesn't simply vanish into inactivity as soon as the cross-game events end.</div></div><hr />
