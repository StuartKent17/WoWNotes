We understand that raw patch notes don’t always provide enough context for changes to the game, so we thought we’d take a moment to explain some of our logic behind the buffs and nerfs coming in the 4.2 “Rage of the Firelands” patch. We particularly want to try to combat the perception that classes end up nerfed in PvE as collateral damage from PvP nerfs (or vice versa). The number of PvP buffs versus PvP nerfs were about equal this time around, and we make careful consideration to keep the impact outside of PvP minimal. So, if we nerfed your class’s PvE damage, it’s most likely because we thought your class was doing too much damage in PvE.<br />
<br />
No doubt you’ll disagree with some of our logic -- “But we were middle of the pack!” seems to be the common rebuttal these days. Balance is an art, though, not a science. (This topic probably deserves its own blog, but I’ll try to spell it out briefly.)<br />
<br />
Balancing a Battleship<br />
Player feedback certainly plays a role in our deciding to make balance changes, but it’s just one small part. (And remember that our public forums are not the only place where players voice their opinions.) We also do a lot of internal testing, both simulations and actual character performance, and we collect a lot of external data, which needs to include players at a wide variety of skill levels.<br />
<br />
If a class is performing poorly except in the hands of one percent of the population, that’s a problem, but it’s not an excuse for that class to be overpowered when played by that one percent, especially in PvP. In PvP, your group composition (whether your whole Arena team or just the participants in a given fight in a Battleground) matters enormously. In PvE, the encounter specifics matter enormously (and we’re about to get a new cast of characters in Firelands). As a result, it can be challenging to decide which numbers are the right numbers. It doesn’t make sense to balance PvE damage solely around Patchwerk-style target dummies and assume everything else is a gimmick. Likewise it doesn’t make sense to buff and nerf for each individual encounter. (Say a boss buffs casters -- do you then nerf casters as a consequence?)<br />
<br />
Also realize that we don’t believe in the existence of any single thermometer for estimating character performance. By that I mean there is no single relatively-accurate measurement of real and true DPS (or tanking, or healing) upon which most players agree. Everything from simulations to target dummy DPS to Arena comp percentages to the top 100 raid parses all count as pieces of the puzzle, and you really have to consider the totality of all of that information in the proper context.<br />
<br />
Resto druids “win” healing meters now in part because their raid cooldown, Tranquility, shows up as healing. Warriors do well on Chimaeron because they take a lot of raid damage. Resto shaman heal well on Chimaeron because everyone is wounded all the time.) Yet once you start eliminating data -- “oh that’s a gimmick fight” or “oh, someone is inflating their meters by attacking an irrelevant target” -- you risk skewing the results.<br />
<br />
Statistics is a complex business. That doesn’t mean all of this stuff is inherently unknowable and nobody should bother. It just means you have to be careful; the discussions about these topics are never short and simple. It's wise to be skeptical when anyone attempts to boil down conclusions on class balance to very simple declarations.<br />
<br />
Simple Declarations<br />
Having said that, we have a lot of ground to cover below, so some of these notes are going to be very terse by necessity. My apologies in advance.<br />
<br />
General<br />
<br />
We changed the way interrupts interact with spell schools. Our intent when we created dual school spells (like Mind Spike being Frost and Shadow) was to allow players locked out of one school to still have something to cast, and we now have the technology to deliver on that design. However, we maintained the rule that being interrupted while casting a dual-school spell will lock you out of both schools because we didn’t want players to only use those spells as a way of avoiding interruption.<br />
We changed all heals to have 200% crits because we wanted to make crit a more attractive stat to healers. Anything random is already at a disadvantage when viewed by a healer, and one point of haste just flat out increased throughput more than a point of crit.<br />
We removed the threat caused by buffs or crowd control because we wanted to make communication and coordination easier in dungeons, especially among strangers using Dungeon Finder. We want the challenge of a dungeon encounter to be the encounter mechanics, not marking targets. We also think this change will be a quality of life improvement for tanks, who inherited a lot of the responsibility for explaining fights, marking targets and otherwise setting the pace.<br />
We changed the values of Agility for plate-wearers and Strength for leather-wearers to reinforce which type of armor you should be using and so we wouldn’t have to spend diminishing returns trying to balance tanks wearing non-traditional armor sets.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
We added the cast time to Hungering Cold for PvP reasons. It is one of the most powerful forms of crowd control in the game, especially in Battlegrounds, and yet was impossible to prevent.<br />
The nerfs to Obliterate and Howling Blast were made because Frost damage was too high in both PvP and PvE. Note that these values were hotfixed -- you shouldn’t see damage drop further when 4.2 goes live.<br />
The Glyph of Dark Succor change was to keep Death Strike from providing so much healing in PvP.<br />
The Might of the Frozen Wastes change was a small tweak to help keep one-handed Frost relatively competitive with two-handed style.<br />
The Unholy Might buff was to help catch Unholy up to Frost in PvE. Interestingly, we didn’t nerf Unholy damage at all in 4.1, but you can still see a small drop in their DPS because so many talented DKs went Frost. I’d love to have the discussion some time about how close two similar specs need to be before players will play the one that is most fun for them and not the one that does theoretical higher damage. Is it 5%? 1%? 0%?<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
We boosted Feral damage to compensate for their losing the attack power from Strength. Net DPS shouldn’t change much overall, though burst may be slightly higher. (We didn’t want to buff bleeds since that was a problem before in PvP.)<br />
We cut back on the power of Innervates from Feral and Balance druids because we felt they were contributing to too much healer mana.<br />
We changed several Balance druid mechanics to cut down on the damage they could do while moving in both PvP and PvE and to cut back on some of their strength in multi-dot fights in PvE. Furthermore, we felt like druids were spending too much time at one end or the other of the Eclipse bar by using dots rather than moving the bar back and forth as intended.<br />
We toned down bear damage, because they were going to do more DPS than other tanks while tanking. Other changes were made to keep bears from neglecting certain core abilities.<br />
We redesigned Restoration’s mastery because it was devalued in situations where druids did a lot of raid healing by HoT-ing different targets, especially in 25-player raids.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/271-Hunter) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..hunter) / Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1118-Hunter-Cataclysm))<br />
<br />
Multi-Shot was doing too much damage in PvE given how simple it was to use.<br />
Careful Aim allowed Marskman hunters to do too much damage in PvE raiding, where the 80% health phase could last for a long stretch of time.<br />
However, the Careful Aim nerf also affected Survival, whose DPS was fine or even a little low, so we buffed Black Arrow to compensate.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/272-Mage) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..mage) / Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1669-Mage-Cataclysm))<br />
<br />
We nerfed Arcane Blast because Arcane’s damage was too high in PvE. We wanted Arcane to be competitive with Fire, especially given that Fire tends to perform better on fights with movement or multiple targets. However, it looked like many Fire mages were begrudgingly respeccing to Arcane, which wasn’t the intent. We wanted Arcane to be competitive, not the only serious mage spec for PvE. (See Frost vs. Unholy note above.)<br />
We originally tried nerfing Spellsteal’s cooldown, but that made it feel really random (for both sides) since the mage had no control over which spell was stolen. We instead nerfed the mana cost to encourage tactical use of Spellsteal and discourage spamming. We’d still like to try a model where dispels have a long cooldown but remove everything, but that is too big a change for now.<br />
We added the diminishing returns to Deep Freeze and Ring of Frost (after earlier trying some different nerfs) to tone down Frost mage control, especially in the mid and lower tiers of PvP when dispels can’t be assured.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/273-Paladin) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..paladin) / Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1670-Paladin-Cataclysm))<br />
<br />
We concluded PvE Holy paladins were ending fights with too much mana relative to other healers, so we raised the mana cost of their single-target heals.<br />
We tweaked Holy Light because we wanted it to compete a little more with Divine Light, especially when used with Beacon of Light.<br />
We buffed Word of Glory for three reasons: We felt Holy Power was mattering less to Holy paladins than it did at Cataclysm launch. We wanted to provide more uninterruptible healing in PvP. We knew Light of Dawn was trumping Word of Glory in almost all cases in 25-player raids.<br />
We changed the Denounce mechanic to give Holy paladins slightly more offensive utility in PvP. We felt that ignoring the other healing classes came at some risk which was not the case for paladins.<br />
We buffed Holy Radiance both to help PvE paladins feel like they could make larger contributions to raid healing (especially in light of the single-target nerfs) but also as part of a significant buff to Speed of Light to let Holy paladins have more mobility in PvP.<br />
We made a tweak to Holy’s mastery to allow its bubble to stack, so it would be wasted less often when healing a single target.<br />
We made Selfless Healer, Divine Protection, and Beacon of Light no longer dispellable so that paladins didn’t lose so much of their survivability in PvP to dispels. (At no point in this patch was Avenging Wrath undispellable -- that was a myth.)<br />
We redesigned Holy Shield, partially because paladin mitigation was going to be too good in the Firelands raid, but also because many paladins (though of course not all) told us they wanted a more dynamic rotation and less passive mitigation.<br />
We buffed Seal of Righteousness to let Retribution use it for AE fights as intended, and also to buff Ret AE damage overall.<br />
We made a slight buff to Selfless Healer. While we thought the old model was unbalanced and turned Ret into too much of a healing spec, we heard from a lot of players who liked the utility of being able to help heal somewhat. This talent should provide that trade-off in a more balanced way.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Shadow was doing too much DPS in PvE when multiple DoTs was favored, so we nerfed their DoT damage. We want Shadow to benefit from multi-DoTs, but Shadow’s damage was just too high under those conditions. We buffed Shadow cast-time spells to compensate.<br />
We changed the facing requirement of Psychic Horror as a PvP quality of life change to make it consistent with other non-projectile crowd control spells.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/275-Rogue) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..rogue) / Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1122-Rogue-Cataclysm))<br />
<br />
We nerfed Cloak of Shadows because it felt like Subtlety rogues could counter both casters and melee specs too easily. This change forces them to choose between Cloak of Shadows and Combat Readiness.<br />
However, we wanted to compensate rogues for this PvP nerf, and we concluded rogue damage in PvE was also too low, so we buffed their damage overall.<br />
The buff to Hemorrhage was designed to make it less punishing when it wasn’t possible to get behind a target, which often arises in PvP but also sometimes in PvE.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/276-Shaman) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..shaman) / Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1124-Shaman-Cataclysm))<br />
<br />
We previously nerfed Water Shield via hotfix because shaman were gaining too much mana in PvP when attacked (especially by pets to discourage drinking). The 4.2 change is just a more elegant implementation of the same nerf that should keep the same mana per time as they have currently.<br />
We recognized Fire Nova had some usability issues so we increased its throughput and added the Flame Shock refresh mechanic to help ease some of the inconvenience. This is a new mechanic and one we are still evaluating.<br />
We introduced the Glyph of Unleashed Lightning to help shaman feel less punished by movement in both PvP and PvE. The impact of changes like this are very difficult to model.<br />
We nerfed Mana Tide for the same reason we nerfed Innervate -- it was just providing too much mana for the group’s healers as a whole. We didn’t want to decrease the benefit to the shaman, so we redesigned / added the talent of Resurgence to help offset the nerf to them personally.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
We nerfed the Glyph of Soul Swap to reduce the ease of applying multiple DoTs in PvP.<br />
We nerfed Drain Life because Affliction was forsaking Shadowbolt in PvE, which wasn’t intended. We want Drain Life to be for utility, not primarily for damage, and we want all casters to have to hard cast at least some of the time. This was done via hotfix and players won’t see a change in 4.2.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/278-Warrior) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..warrior) / Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1676-Warrior-Cataclysm))<br />
<br />
We put Deadly Calm and Recklessness on the same cooldown to reduce warrior burst in PvP.<br />
We also nerfed Arms and Fury damage across the board because they were doing too much damage in both PvP and PvE. While we are sensitive to casters outperforming melee on several raid encounters, having warriors handily outperform all other melee isn’t the solution to that problem.<br />
The stance requirement changes on long cooldowns was a quality of life change.<br />
We didn’t want warriors using Charge as a rotational ability on some fights without actually having to move (which was a bug created as a result of a fix put in to help hunter problems with minimum range).<br />
<br />
<br />
Raid Nerfs<br />
<br />
As discussed previously, now that players who have spent a lot of time in Throne of the Four Winds, Blackwing Descent, and Bastion of Twilight are moving on to Firelands, we wanted to make sure players who previously couldn’t progress on those raids are now able to experience them. In a way, this provides new content for everyone -- if you’re done with the 4.0 raids, you now have 4.2. If you haven’t seen the 4.0 raids yet, now’s your chance.<br />
<br />
<br />
As I write this, 4.2 has not been completed, so there is still time for us to make additional changes. Constructive feedback is always welcome. Even the most articulate, logical, and passionate argument won’t always force our hand, but it helps.<br />

You're right, any frost Dk speccing into Hungering Cold is doing it wrong. The only exception possibly being if that Dk's sole purpose is to kite, where I could see it being only a slight hindrance, you'd just have to use your brain and cast it pre-emptively.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, there goes combatreadiness off my bars in arena against any team who has casters.<br />

One fight that these nerfs will really affect (pve-wise) is Nefarian. Frost DKs will not be able to kite the adds as effectively for phase one and it will severely diminish their survivability during that phase (if something goes askew). On Chimaeron I typically will use death strike as it is enough to keep me at enough health but with this change I will have to severely impact my dps to self heal through that. Yes, I understand that these fights will no longer be new as they will be nerfed and typically we will no longer be running these raids but still, if any new fights are added with similar mechanics I can see a problem.</div></div><hr />

Not one melee class can get invulnerable for 8 seconds either. While the nerf may or may not be justified the comment doesn't make any sense the way you stated it.<br />

It is very likely it was done for PvE reasons - if a Warlock can do good DPS while self-healing for a substantial amount, why bring classes who don't automatically self-heal while doing their normal rotation?</div></div><hr />

<br />
This arises from pvp. range classes have more dmg then melee because we have constant contact with the boss without moving, while melee has to move. if u are doing as much as dmg as range then something is wrong with the class. it fucks up pvp since because of gap closer and other slowing abilities you are going to have more contact with the target. thus, if u do as much dmg as range, you will be op in that situation.</div></div><hr />

I am not a die-hard arena dude (yet) , but i was planning to be, and this sounds like less survivability for warlocks.As for the hunter nerf (i do not play a hunter myself), nerfing Multi-shot because it was &quot;too easy to use&quot;? Isn't Fan of Knives, Frost Nova and other multi-hitting abilities &quot;easy to use&quot;? Kinda lame ...Holy palas getting buffed - Good for the pallys, though, i havent really found it &quot;easy&quot; to kill a holy paladin yet, and some of the top healers in arena tournament atm, are paladins, shamans aand priests, so, PvP-wise, i think that paladins are equal to the rest of the healers, depending on the skill of the player.And nerfing basically all PvE content is just lame. Getting free epics isn't that fun, cuz' in the end, everyone will be too lazy to actually do anything, and you'll get epics even faster, with less effort.all in all abit disappointed, but it wont get me quitting ... yet.</div></div><hr />

They were doing too much damage in PvP and were &quot;middle-high&quot; in PvE so they just simplified it and called it &quot;too much damage in PvP and PvE&quot;. Makes it look better that way for them.</div></div><hr />

I didn't argue on the latter but the former is simply wrong. Icebound fortitude has a 3 minute cooldown with 20% damage reduce and is the weakest ability of this kind in game. AMS while being great has a damage cap and doesn't work against physical.<br />

<br />
please do tell what cooldowns DK's have that are similar to those classes? there must be some reason why DK's are instantly focus nuked down when they enter the arena. 20% physical damage reduction and lesser version of CoS. compared to immunity + melee immunity that is also castable on team mates, + stunbrake if you want to compare to IBF. cos, CR, evasion + reset. warriors have it hard but they have better shieldwall, granted it will lock your damage but save you from focus nuke, spellreflect and regeneration. Ferals have barkskin that can easily be improved to 50% with talents, also bearform and enraged regeneration. <br />
<br />
I argue that DK's have the worst cooldowns against focus nuke in the game. Even shamans have 40% all damage reduction in shamanistic rage and the totem shield</div></div><hr />

hungering cold was great for pve, gathering the adds on conclave heroic, freezing them, waiting for those spore attacks to stop, and everyone focus aoe them down was a blast... now it won't be possible with being hit by the mobs and having +2 second cast time cuz of pushbacks, you'll eat aoe dmg :3<br />

they alrdy do that with some spells in the game, like sap works only for some seconds on players, but up to 3 mins on NPC's, there's no problem in doing that.

<br />
Some of these nerfs may be justified by PvP sure. But they are not justified for PvE, some of what they say is untrue. It all comes back to the colossus smash issue that came up, there last ditch effort was to finally give in and seperate how it works in PvE and PvP, and they admitted to how they do not like doing it because it&quot;over complicates&quot; the game for the newer players. These things aren't as major as changing a move such as colossus smash in a big way, so they can get away with skimming across the board on somethings. But still I do not find it acceptable they really need to learn to start changing there PvP and PvE in seperate forms. Not treating it like the same.</div></div><hr />

matie, i suppose you know that buffing base damage by 30% doesn't buff the damage by 30% -.- and i hope you also know that even if you buffed howling blasts coefficency by 30% and then nerfed it by 50% for pvp, you would get a total of 35% damage nerf in pvp</div></div><hr />

It's so much more appreciable than vague, arguably pointless, posts like &quot;we think the mass proliferation of interrupts might be killing our game,&quot; or &quot;a Cataclysm talents 'post-mortem.'&quot; <br />
It also has the ability to take discussions to another level; instead of a discussion where people continuously put forth ideas and guesses as to why they think a change was made (in which nothing of concrete value ever truly gets discussed), they are now free to discuss the change itself and its potential ramifications, or even just flat out state why they disagree with their reasoning. All in all, it's a much more useful discussion, both for its own merits and for that of feedback as well. <br />

I never really look into reading why you make changes, I just go with the flow and learn to work around it. However, I do have a thought that you may or may not have thought about. I don't know how hard it would be to implement, but, with the tool-tip and the spell itself; you can have a 'to NPC / to Player,' tag. For example, I play a Boomkin, so my Wrath spell would look like this, 'Causes 675 to 761 Nature damage to the target NPC and 475 to 561 Nature damage to the target Player Character.' Or something along those lines. That way you can have the same spell for all classes, and keep PVE buffs/nerfs leveled out because each spell would be split into 2 different categories. So if a character is OP in PVE, you can nerf the PVE part, and keep the class viable in PVP and on-par with the other classes. You can balance out 2 different trees of each spell. This way would also require a lot of time going through every spell a class uses and splitting it in half however. But after that, I don't see a problem with it unless anyone else does. Thoughts?<br />
<br />
Good idea, it'll never happen.<br />
<br />
You people really need to understand Greg Street was not hired for his game design ability, he was hired for his ability to streamline development and lower costs. You do not go from being a marine biologist to a couple years working on a RTS game to lead designer on the biggest MMO in the world because you're a &quot;nice guy&quot;. You get there by demonstrating the ability to lower costs while blatantly lying to people about what your goal actually is. Think back, just about everything G. Street has said the exact opposite has happened.<br />
<br />
Fun fact: In the orientation for new hires for most corporations they have this little game where each individual is told to lie, whomever has the most believable tale wins. I'm betting Mr. Street won that little contest.</div></div><hr />

I think some people are happy to see things confirmed. But at the sametime, the way they try to justify nerfs for PvP and PvE at the sametime, will cause a lot more rage. PvP and Pve completely different. you can't nerf them both and say it works out for both.</div></div><hr />

That is actually only illusion of communication cause if it doesn't work both ways it doesn't work at all. First we were shouting at a huge, fat wall made out of obsidium and only heard the echo of our own voices.

Ferals have barkskin that can easily be improved to 50% with talents, also bearform and enraged regeneration. <br />
<br />
I argue that DK's have the worst cooldowns against focus nuke in the game. Even shamans have 40% all damage reduction in shamanistic rage and the totem shield<br />

One fight that these nerfs will really affect (pve-wise) is Nefarian. Frost DKs will not be able to kite the adds as effectively for phase one and it will severely diminish their survivability during that phase (if something goes askew). On Chimaeron I typically will use death strike as it is enough to keep me at enough health but with this change I will have to severely impact my dps to self heal through that. Yes, I understand that these fights will no longer be new as they will be nerfed and typically we will no longer be running these raids but still, if any new fights are added with similar mechanics I can see a problem.<br />
<br />
Dude.. join the rest of us. As a rogue I have to impact my dps to heal myself. And my heal isn't even instant. What about hybrids that have to stop dpsing completely to heal?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because Warlocks need to do a substantial amount of Lifetapping to keep their mana up. They MUST do this to do raid dps, they are balanced around needing to do this, and any health gains they received from their sources of self-healing were far, far outweighed by the need to lifetap. Not to mention the most basic of healer spells outclassed their self-healing by a country mile.</div></div><hr />

Of course you can't just look at statistics to balance a game because random pve fights with weird mechanics, unless you rule it out, will skew your results. That's absolutely idiotic and pointless. The only sound way to balance the game is 1) Around abilities (Who can do what and you can do it to) and 2) Damage verses other players in a neutral environment. Looking at random derp dps meters from pve boss number 32 that gives mages an infinite mana buff or warriors super rage is not a good idea. This is why you have shit like frost dk's running around blowing shit up in the first place. It becomes an endless circle-jerk trying to balance the game this way.</div></div><hr />

So, their intention was to &quot;compensate dps loss&quot;, not to buff the worst PvE spec. No wonder buffs was so weak. Seems 20% is new 5% in terms of 'acceptable dps difference&quot;. What a freaking retards.<br />

You cant do what you propose, it is just impossible. I am sure the setups they have far surpass whatever idea of 'the wow matrix' as you envision it, but the point is that even with this amount of data you cant take every tiny little thing in every situation into account to get absolute balance. <br />
<br />
Nah, the only way you can hope to balance a game like this is to do exactly what they do, make the best decisions they can at the time given the data they have available, and then buff/nerf when there are inevitably classes out of whack. It does lead to things being broken occasionally unexpectedly - or even when they kind of did expect it but just wanted to see how it worked out - but I guess you kind of have to deal with it in a game like this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, giving explanations for balance changes is a brilliant idea, and i really hope they keep doing it for future patches.</div></div><hr />

'ruins' PvE, huh? You do realize the change makes almost no difference whatsoever when it comes to kiting adds, right? This is the difference it makes: once every minute you have to precast hungering cold 1.5 seconds before you want it to take effect. That's right, you have to take 2 steps, and cast for 1.5s to aoe cc every single one of those mobs. If that's your idea of ruining, you have some serious issues.</div></div><hr />

I mean, let's have a look at the whole dps theorycraft thingy going on with sims and ingame damage meters and stuff. Almost all of these are done (talking sims here) on Patchwork style fight, which doesn't correspond 100% to actual game play, but people treat them as such. In game I bet that many of you whinerz look more at recount when playing the game than what's actually going on in the fight! <br />

<br />
We recognized Fire Nova had some usability issues so we increased its throughput and added the Flame Shock refresh mechanic to help ease some of the inconvenience. This is a new mechanic and one we are still evaluating.<br />
<br />
<br />
But the problem is, is that Glyph of Dark Succor was added/redesigned -- whichever -- to address survival for Frost and Unholy in PvE in the first place. With the change to the glyph in 4.2, it is now going to be a waste of a glyph slot.<br />
<br />
As a shaman, I was at first excited to try out the new mechanic for Fire Nova when Blizzard rolled it out. It was something different and it seemed to have the potential to be an actual improvement. Now that there's been plenty of time to experience it, however, I must say that it is quite clunky and feels like it completely missed its purpose. By the time I could get even 2 Flame Shocks on adds to make Fire Nova worthwhile, they're either very close to death or are already dead. I would rather Blizzard rolled back to the previous Fire Nova.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I agree with you 100% here. I don't think it would be that hard, a little research into what spells are used in PvP and put them into the tree, deep in the tree add resi multipliers such as th 31 point talent along with the skill you obtain also increases your resi by 100% as this would mean that someone doing PvP without this talent only has 1/2 the resi of someone who does have it</div></div><hr />

i mean didn't we go through the 4.1 pvp nerfs and the 40% increase in white damage to compensate? did that not fix anything? warriors are doing a ton less damage in pvp since then, and just about the same dps in pve since then. when exactly did we go from doing less in pvp, and the same in pve to &quot;OMFG! I JUST KILLED EVERYTHING IN ONE SWING!&quot; like the dev poster is trying to say our damage is at.<br />
<br />
that is why i call lies. that is like a car manufacturer putting a governor in your engine so you cannot go above 50mph, and a cop pulls you over and insists that you were going 120mph. IT'S FREAKING IMPOSSIBLE. we can not be doing more damage than we were after massive nerfs to our damage output in the last patch. i would understand if we were already into tier 13 gear, but what possible variable has increased our dps in pvp and pve since 4.1?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The dumbest thing i've every heard and i worked at a school of the mentally retarded! Melee overall DPS in PvE is a joke compared to ranged. i play a rogue and was hoping that after 7 mounths the probs we have in PvE would be fixed, and yes ty for what has been worked out as a 3-4% buff, that will put us at about....... the same on recount as we was GG blizz.<br />
<br />
<br />
While we are sensitive to casters outperforming melee on several raid encounters. <br />
And what have you done about it? maybe we can hope for a fix after Firelands.... 1year after the problem was learned? As always blizz, i do agree with most of the changes but it seems you address the small problems and just can't be bothered to look at the big one's :(</div></div><hr />

It just makes me wish they had a similar system Guild Wars has where a skill too powerfull in PvE is automatically adjusted to be less powerfull in PvP once you've entered the PvP-only area. Creating a completely different PvP tree might not be considered but automatically reducing or 'nerfing' a spell the moment you entered the PvP-only areas like BG's and arenas should totally be considered ._. It's just a dumb thing to read if you're not much of a PvP'er but you want to give your best in a raid.<br />

Having said that....most of the shaman changes are crap.

<br />
More nerfs from PVP....great. So I can be silenced an entire arena fight, I have no regen, and the one &quot;oh shit&quot; heal we had was nerf'd by 20%. Do the devs actually READ the forums, or do they just throw ideas out there and think we &quot;might&quot; be happy with it?<br />

They are quite right. They know their job bettter then 80% claiming they know better... <br />
<br />
If they knew their job so well they wouldn't need to completely change entire rotations, mechanics, etc every 2 months. It shouldn't be hard to realize some changes are horrible decisions (how many class defining abilities have been destroyed/nerfed/crippled since Cata's release ? ) and that constantly playing around with damage coefficients, mana costs, etc shows that they made no plans for an actually balanced game...<br />
<br />
Instead the status quo is to balance the mechanics of the game around the current tier. The next tier comes out, the previous gets nerfed to the ground (so that any careful balance of mechanics to THAT gear and THAT boss is meaningless), and the devs then change around numbers so that in the higher end gear they are still challenged.<br />
<br />
The game is broke, and it's mechanics only work in a vacuum at this point, and they're constantly forced to adjust with their content...instead of changing the system/mechanics such that they will scale along with gear/bosses throughout the expansion.<br />
<br />

and your guild is better because of them. now the only thing that would come from nerfing them would be a cut in your raid's dps output. your rogues, mages, druids, hunters, dk's, paladins, priests, shaman, and warlocks won't be doing more damage because of nerfing your three warriors. it will just make things more difficult for you. what kind of sadistic person would be comfortable with your raid's dps numbers going down as long as it means a class that you do not like is not ahead of you anymore on a trivial meter?<br />

I don't get it. The cast time won't really hurt in PvE cause even when mobs push the timer back, it is only 2 seconds.<br />

Because the mobs you need to use it, when they actually hit you to push the timer back, they probably kill you.<br />

<br />
PvP DKs on AJ are fairly happy that the other things didn't get nerfed like Necrotic Strike.<br />
<br />
Not even DKs could heal 30%+, even frost speced anyway...<br />
<br />
And only them and Paladins would give up damage to heal themselves while others just go passive, like warriors for way more healing (not including victory lolrush).<br />
<br />
To see how they don't know what they did, they buffed unholy str to 20% and totally forgot how that will impact Necrotic Strike... and they'll probably nerf NS even more because ppl will only QQ about DKs and not Unholy DKs.... screwing blood and frost since it will be a skill nerf and not Unholy Str nerf.<br />
<br />
The comments are more like &quot;I don't even know what DKs do, but they're my oponents in pvp, so any nerf is a good called nerf and it's their problem, not mine.&quot;<br />

<br />
The pvp nerfs to dks really hurt their survivability, utility and ability to solo older content in specs other than blood. One fight that these nerfs will really affect (pve-wise) is Nefarian. Frost DKs will not be able to kite the adds as effectively for phase one and it will severely diminish their survivability during that phase (if something goes askew). On Chimaeron I typically will use death strike as it is enough to keep me at enough health but with this change I will have to severely impact my dps to self heal through that. Yes, I understand that these fights will no longer be new as they will be nerfed and typically we will no longer be running these raids but still, if any new fights are added with similar mechanics I can see a problem.<br />
<br />
Yes... those fights are old, but it will limit the possibilities for new ones using mechanics like that.</div></div><hr />

Warrior and DK OP has been obvious and the hit to a warriors burst and DK's insane survivability should mitigate a lot of the OP'ness.Much like Ret was slightly OP when they increased the crusader strike damage, they broke the class by putting a 20sec CD on WoG and now are making it fair again with a 10sec CD (via talent pts). As my main it makes me happy, though I have pretty much given up on ret because of how insanely boring it is compared to playing other classes.Hunters still remain garbage in PVP and easy high dps in PVE. My first character since I started playing 1.5 years ago was a Hunter and he was absolute garbage in PVP so I switched to Pally and never looked back. My main reason for switching to a pally was to get even with rogues, who ate my hunter alive. And now that I've been playing with the rogue a bit, I realize how useless hunters are. Stand a few feet back, watch the hunter drop useless traps, wait out deterrance, use his launch back, shadowstep myself, dead.</div></div><hr />

Mage, hunter,warlock and rogue's are pure dps classes, and i think these should top the dps meter anyday. They dont have anything to choose from than dps. Warrior, paladin and dk's should have good defence and good agro and what tanks can use more, since they are the plate wearer, right now they have a pretty pretty good dps too, which i think isn't right. Priest, druid and shamans should have their top prioritet in healing. Not that i say they should have bad dps tanks and healer classes, but they can choose from several spec's. If tank and healer classes want high dps they should make a dps class insteed of expecting to be top in every spec they got. I know its blizzards fault to like give a paladin all kinds of spec , it can heal, tank and dps. maybe we just should have this one class then there woundn't be this QQ all the time. But to point out once again we got 4 classes in WoW that ONLY can dps and nothing else, keep nerf that and those classes wont be played anymore. Well some might but why would anyone want those in raids when all the rest can cover it all by themself. Just some thoughts i had, and i know i could have written it better if i took my time :P</div></div><hr />

Blizzard should really make some changes to spells/abilities like they did with Colossus Smash instead of nerfing/buffing/redesigning mastery, passive bonuses from talent specializations and talents over and over and over like they do.<br />
<br />
Just look at Arms Warriors. According to simulationcraft they are gonna be fifth worse dps spec? That's without using Charge of course. And for those who don't believe me...<br />

<br />
No, it will just take some effort this time to get DPS rather than going in and mashing buttons. I can't wait to see the flush of PVP players that charge, rip off armor, 2 big hits, kick down, 2 big hits and wonder why their target isn't dead for their &quot;efforts&quot;.</div></div><hr />

You can't just buff everybody up to the level of the top performers. Then the content will become trivial. The idea is to bring the top performers down and the bottom performers up, keeping the average roughly the same.<br />
<br />
and if warriors were miles above everyone else on every fight i could see your point. but when warriors are only better than everyone else by 1% on one or two fights that is not making content trivial. nerfing warrior dps means that they will be even more horrible on every other fight that they are not top performers on.<br />
<br />
you can't just nerf a class because they happen to be on top by a little bit. otherwise you are just constantly nerfing everyone to the ground sooner or later. balance is not nerfing warriors to the point where a raid leader asks his/her one warrior dps to sit for a class that now out performing him/her by a large margin thanks to the nerf.<br />
<br />
also.. i do not think a lot of people enter this variable into the equation. some warriors are very well geared. some of the dps classes that they are out dpsing are not so well geared. is it fair to nerf the warrior class because of another person's crappy gear? should warriors in full tier 13 do less dps than a mage in half t-11, half 346 gear? because that is exactly why we will get majorly nerfed again in 4.3. everything equal my left buttock.</div></div><hr />

The simple to use, um all AoEs are easy and Id consider keeping ISS and Bombardment up harder than most.<br />
<br />
Regardless what you think, to brainless spam multi-shot is not hard at all. Pretty much all other specs in the game have two forms of AoE that they have to use at same time for maximum damage, except hunters and frost mage (which isn't a viable raid spec to begin with). If you read the patch notes, you will see that coming patch 4.2, traps will benefit from AP, Spell Pen, Hit, etc... This will increase the Explosive Trap damage, which makes Hunter's AoE roughly the same for those using traps. For hunters who only spam Multi-shot and never use traps, well, sucks to be you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Traps already benefit from AP, spell pen does nothing in pve, and 5% less chance to miss will not buff traps enough to make up for the multi shot nerf.<br />
<br />
Also, I'm quite sure that AoE as a hunter is significantly harder than most other classes. For most casters, its &quot;channel some AoE spell.&quot; For melee, its &quot;spam AoE skills x and or y.&quot; For hunters, its trap launcher --&gt; explosive trap, target mob in middle of pack (if not in a tight group), 2-3 multi shots, 2 Steady Shots, tab targeting if enemy dies, 2 multi shots, 2 steady shots, repeat. If you think hunters can just brainlessly spam multi shot, you're either doing it wrong or have never played a hunter.</div></div><hr />

25 - 40k mana?<br />
<br />
From where? From the wording of Glyph of Innervate I just cannot see how can Feral boost his own Innervate for 5x - 8x times more<br />
<br />
????<br />
<br />
Unless the Glyph is some other.<br />
<br />
On the other hand in such occasion if Glyph can increase the mana gain by so much than Glyph needs to change NOT the spell itself! Why even bother to nerf unglyphed, lackluster spell which is not even worth casting for a Feral Druid?</div></div><hr />

Interestingly, we didn’t nerf Unholy damage at all in 4.1, but you can still see a small drop in their DPS because so many talented DKs went Frost. I’d love to have the discussion some time about how close two similar specs need to be before players will play the one that is most fun for them and not the one that does theoretical higher damage. Is it 5%? 1%? 0%? I sincerely hope that whoever wrote this doesn't decide everything to do with DK 'balance' changes. They saw a drop in DPS because they nerfed Unholy, not because everyone switched to Frost. If people switch to Frost, there is still going to be a drop in DPS for Unholy. Silly blizzard. <br />
The Glyph of Dark Succor change was to keep Death Strike from providing so much healing in PvP. Thanks for removing the potency of self heal in PvE (namely Chim)... <br />
The Might of the Frozen Wastes change was a small tweak to help keep one-handed Frost relatively competitive with two-handed style. GG on making 2H Frost even worse than Unholy.</div></div><hr />

I don't get it. The cast time won't really hurt in PvE cause even when mobs push the timer back, it is only 2 seconds.<br />

I never really look into reading why you make changes, I just go with the flow and learn to work around it. However, I do have a thought that you may or may not have thought about. I don't know how hard it would be to implement, but, with the tool-tip and the spell itself; you can have a 'to NPC / to Player,' tag. For example, I play a Boomkin, so my Wrath spell would look like this, 'Causes 675 to 761 Nature damage to the target NPC and 475 to 561 Nature damage to the target Player Character.' Or something along those lines. That way you can have the same spell for all classes, and keep PVE buffs/nerfs leveled out because each spell would be split into 2 different categories. So if a character is OP in PVE, you can nerf the PVE part, and keep the class viable in PVP and on-par with the other classes. You can balance out 2 different trees of each spell. This way would also require a lot of time going through every spell a class uses and splitting it in half however. But after that, I don't see a problem with it unless anyone else does. Thoughts?<br />
<br />
you can tell you're new like you said. a lot of people have been suggesting that for quiet some time now and blizzard's answer was it didn't want to make the game more difficult for new or casual players by having an ability do two different things in two different environments and having to show that on the tooltip. Lame i know.</div></div><hr />

I myself hate the fact that with the pve achievements make you go into a battleground just to complete this quest, i hate pvp i joined a pve server to not pvp now it seems we have to bare the brunt of nerfs to suit players who pvp on pve servers, look after the content clearers imo, leave pvp at the door on pve realms.</div></div><hr />

The reason of this is that if we spam Death Strike we cant do shit for about 8 sec after that because of the stupid rune generation, and we got no survival abilites without the death strike. We got anti magic shield that is up for some seconds and it doesnt help against melee players. We also have a 20% damage reduction with a WAAAAY to high cd. So when we use Dstrike, we can NOT do any damage to the opponent for 8 seconds, and that makes it kinda useless to use as it doesnt do much damage either. And for the Hungering Cold nerf. Wtf blizzard? What about all the other classes AoE cc? What about warriors shout that fears all the nearest players for the same time as dks Hungering Cold freeze them? Why do we get a 1.5 second casting time and they dont get shit on their AoE cc? Dks are already getting overruned in pvp, and now without the only real survival ability we had, we cant do SHIT to survive anymore. 1.5 sec casting time, ye...... so now we're casters? We dont got any other spells with a casting time, so why would you give us one? Atleast when other classes have the exact same abilitys just in other forms, like warriors shout fear. This is just pathetic. So tell me this blizzard, no when warriors stun us, and takes 50% of our health within 5 seconds, and we aint able to heal up with death strike, or freeze them with Hungering Cold because they can interrupt it or run away, how will we be able to survive? Or when the rogue stuns us and do a insane dps, just as warriors. Or when locks dots us up and kite us, and the one time we get through they fear and got one silly death strike before we get a fear or anything else, will these 7% heals from deathstrike be enough to prevent us from dying? No, it wont. And now this game is starting to getting on my nervs. Blizzard, i tell you this, get_life, get a melee class, and fucking try to beat a lock, mage, warrior or any other class as a DK after the patch. This is pathetic and you need to balance it instead of just nerfing one class to the ground.</div></div><hr />

All through the 1st tier of Cata blizzard just fed us bullshit or did not even address why certain changes were made. This is at least something and a move in the right direction. I don't give two shits about pvp balance but I think 4.2 will have us closer to being balanced in pve than we have been in a long time. To answer this question, how close two similar specs need to be before players will play the one that is most fun for them and not the one that does theoretical higher damage. Is it 5%? 1%? 0%?I think it needs to be at least 5% or less. I skilled player can make up a 5% difference without a problem. Anything more will have players favoring the more powerful spec.

I hope you're being sarcastic..<br />

what he wrote is true tbh, every time since cata when the warr's is climing the dps ladder to almost be on equal terms vs the rest of the melee we get beaten down a few steps with that nerfbat.<br />
as it is now we are finaly getting closer again and what do we get? a huge nerf all over the board. thnx blizz<br />
