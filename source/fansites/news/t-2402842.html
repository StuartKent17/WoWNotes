Hey all, 
 
Since the first round of changes to Retribution early on in alpha, we've been letting the spec settle into a steady-state, but have been very much keeping it in mind. Like many have suggested, the spec is almost all the way there, but is missing a little bit baseline.

Hey all,<br />
<br />
Since the first round of changes to Retribution early on in alpha, we've been letting the spec settle into a steady-state, but have been very much keeping it in mind. Like many have suggested, the spec is almost all the way there, but is missing a little bit baseline.<br />
<br />
Blade of Wrath <br />
Blade of Wrath's mechanic is becoming baseline, named Art of War: Your auto attacks have a chance to reset the cooldown of Blade of Justice. Any many correctly pointed out, this is a sort of unpredictability that the spec needed in its baseline rotation.<br />
<br />
Blade of Wrath, the talent, will now increase the frequency of Art of War resets and cause its proc to also increase the damage of the next Blade of Justice by 25%. Numbers are pending tuning, but the gameplay is there.<br />
<br />
Divine Purpose<br />
Divine Purpose's proc chance has been reduced to 15% (down from 20%), but it now also increases the damage and healing of that free Holy Power spender by 20%.<br />
<br />
The entire value of this talent was in the free Holy Power proc, which is a huge swing on button presses and pacing, but which neither of its talent match-ups provide. This change reduces that difference slightly and gives Divine Purpose a little more nuance to its gameplay â€“ now you may consider saving or waiting for that proc to use on a different Holy Power spender from usual.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the patience and continued feedback.</div></div><hr />

Then choose a class with 2 or 3 dps specs to do it, not one with only 1 dps spec</div></div><hr />

let me get this straight... you reduce a spell's power by 33.3% (repeating of course) ... and then buff it by 20%.... classic blizzard nerf!<br />
<br />
idk, maybe it plays fine on beta, maybe this was intended... maybe someone is bad at math.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doesnt make sense to do such good dmg burst, have immune to snare, a crazy bubble that lasts forever, able to toss in a heal, able to instant LoH to full hp AND on top of that move like a DH... you guys gotta have ONE weakness... seriously!</div></div><hr />

<br />
...who wants more unpredictability? Why?<br />
<br />
Are you going to fix the proc chance so that it doesn't proc on your very first auto attack, or proc literally 1 second before coming off cooldown?<br />
<br />
Predictability is fun. Unpredictability is not. Please keep that as a talent so I can stay FAR away from it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think there should be a nice mix between predictability and unpredictability. Procs do make a spec more fun. Predictability will make a spec stale and boring, but a spec that relies only on procs doesn't work either. This change provides a nice balance.<br />
<br />
I also don't understand why you're complaining about a talent becoming baseline.</div></div><hr />

That is a very subjective opinion you've got there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So all in all I think this is a change most of the Ret paladins will like. There's still some wiggling room for the final numerical values on this, but we'll have to see how all of that plays once the next build is up.</div></div><hr />

Fair enough if you are willing to trade away bubble, loh, hand of freedom or something.. stop trying to cram everything good into one spec.. u DO need a weakness... and you have none really as you even got your lil pony!</div></div><hr />

Another suggestion would be, we would like a jump similar to the Tank DH thought the hole BG maps within 15 sec. In addtion i would like survive like the warriors, when they reach 1life, I continue fist them but they stay alive for at least 15sec. would be nice to have too. ( after those 15sec auto bubble comes out and fill-full automatic your live to 100%. If you run out of ideas, I need something like a vanish and a permanent dot which do dmg a lot. So i can go afk and still top dd. ThaNK YOU</div></div><hr />

They feel like bonuses to me, especially now that they are going to hit harder. Thats more fun than stale rotations that can be math'd out to a precise formula.<br />
<br />
Procs are part of ret's identity, all the way back to reck bombs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Funny you point that out, because that's kind of my point.<br />
<br />
You like that proc? Talent into it. I didn't like it. I didn't talent into it. Now I'll have no choice, if I even decide that I'm going to play Ret this time around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
20% dropped to 15% is a 25% proc chance reduction (or reduction in strength as you said), not 33.3% repeating.<br />
<br />
Somebody is bad at math.<br />
It's not blizzard.</div></div><hr />
