It can be easy to mix up words in interviews when you're covering a range of story points such as that of the Blood Trolls and their interactions with the Zandalari - but we just wanted to be sure we could get a note out on this before we get more Allied Race rumors flying around. <br />

Guys if you cut out the other words it clearly is a conspiracy that says Blood Trolls will be an allied race.</div></div><hr />

Not once did I think he meant they'd be an Allied Race, but I guess the hype is real.</div></div><hr />

Blood Trolls confirmed as Allied Race there. Nice catch.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">McNeil</div><div class="date">2018-06-12, 09:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good. They shouldn't do allied races when you could just add all of the blood troll features to the barber shop, but rather make allied races that look a lot more unique.</div></div><hr />

I know people want absolutely everything to be an AR nowadays, but who would genuinely think that Blood Trolls of all races would be an AR?</div></div><hr />

Important fact to keep in mind: they have taken the trouble to denounce that the blood trolls arent an allied race.<br />
About the Vulpera and the San'layn they said nothing...hope here! :D &lt;3</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cocomen2</div><div class="date">2018-06-12, 09:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LeL , why does they even talk about (blood trolls at) BFA at E3 - just to sellout xpac that kids who live under a stone didnt know a thing about?<br />
<br />
E3 , blood trolls (planned yet) isnt even allied race ... nuff said wasted time of some other man who HAVE a thing to say about his game at E3.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kaid</div><div class="date">2018-06-12, 09:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is kinda what I was expecting and they were talking about zandalari. Blood trolls would make zero sense for either faction to want as allies no matter how desperate they are.</div></div><hr />

Expansion is looking good!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Necroxis</div><div class="date">2018-06-12, 09:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its in response to the ten zillion clickbait videos people farted out the second that interview was over claiming, &quot;Blizzard confirmed Blood Trolls as an Allied Race!&quot;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Queen of Hamsters</div><div class="date">2018-06-12, 09:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So in other words, they either confirm, or deny in clear terms which races will be Allied races.<br />
<br />
Barrens Giraffe possible Allied race!!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ninthbelief</div><div class="date">2018-06-12, 10:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't imagine they ever would be, but just to voice this outloud, I love their aesthetic and think they'd be cool as hell as an Allied Race if not just an addition to playable Darkspear troll customization.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adara</div><div class="date">2018-06-12, 10:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blood Troll Allied Race confirmed?!?!<br />
