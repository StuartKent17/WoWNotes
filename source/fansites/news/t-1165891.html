Heroes of Azeroth, prepare to embark for an exotic new frontier! World of Warcraft®: Mists of Pandaria™ is launching on September 25, 2012 and you can be ready to play when the servers go live by pre-purchasing the game digitally (http://us.battle.net/en/int). Plus, for the first time ever, players will have the option to upgrade a pre-purchase to the all-new Digital Deluxe Edition which comes with all of the in-game items from the retail Collector’s Edition, including a World of Warcraft pet and mount, banner sigil and accent for Diablo® III, and Battle.net® portraits for StarCraft® II.<br />
<br />
Beginning September 25, 2012, World of Warcraft players around the world will be able to set sail for the long-lost continent of Pandaria, where they’ll explore forgotten dungeons, vanquish risen evils, and play their part in the Horde-Alliance conflict as it reaches a critical breaking point.<br />
<br />
Whether you plan to level your existing character to 90 or start fresh with a new pandaren monk, it’s never too early to begin preparing for your adventure. Simply log in to your Battle.net® account (https://us.battle.net/login/en/), and then pre-purchase Mists of Pandaria. You’ll then be flagged to automatically download the expansion content prior to release so you’ll be ready to go when the game launches.<br />
<br />
During the pre-purchase process, you’ll have the option to grab either the Mists of Pandaria Standard Edition (http://blizzard.com/games/mists/) for $39.99 USD or the all-new Digital Deluxe edition (http://battle.net/wow/services/digital-deluxe/) for $59.99 USD -- or, if you snag the standard edition now and decide you want to upgrade to Digital Deluxe later, you’ll have the opportunity to do so for an additional $20.<br />
<br />
The Digital Deluxe edition includes a full digital copy of the expansion, as well as a selection of Pandaria-inspired in-game content for World of Warcraft, Diablo III, and StarCraft II. If you’re looking for even more plunder, a special Mists of Pandaria Collector’s Edition (http://battle.net/wow/services/collectors-edition/) with additional bonus items will also be available exclusively at select retail locations for a suggested retail price of $79.99 USD.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
It has already been stated that the prepatch will last for 2 weeks. The release date is on a Tuesday so that lines up nicely for patch day which would happen on Sept 11th. Also, unlike Cata there is no unlocked content at the prepatch, just a different talent system. Pet battles (like archaeology) won't be unlocked until the xpac is released even though you don't need to buy MoP to take advantage of it.</div></div><hr />

That's 2 months from today, and Cata was only out for 21 months then. I remember another game that was released earlier this year, gave us 2 months notice, same publisher even. What was that called... Diabolical? Hope this next one doesn't suck nearly as bad, Cata was horribly designed and implemented so one can only hope.

I have the CE's for StarCraft II and Diablo III but I never even watched the DVDs and only opened the art books once. But Raynor's dog tags and the Diablo skull make their CE's worth it to me. The mousepad, I'm still up in the air about. It's the digital content that I get the CE's for, so I guess I just made up my own mind. Digital Deluxe, here I come!</div></div><hr />

<br />
But what amazed me about this whole process was all the times individuals made similar reasonable educated guesses, based on past history/current beta progress, we got flamed for being rationale. There is a big difference between what you hope for (June/July releases etc) and what can be accomplished. <br />
<br />
And for pete's sake next expansion...if nothing else...before you flame people that make similar sound educated guesses...please remember this ONE THING:<br />
<br />
THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND ALWAYS WILL BE EXACTLY 2 MONTHS BETWEEN ANNOUNCEMENT AND SHIP DATE<br />
<br />
this has been true of all WoW expansions, D3 and even GW2 and it's due to time constraints associated with pressing the master copy, final box specs/printing and shipping times to 1000's of retail outlets all over the world<br />
<br />
So next time, when you want it to come out in XXX month and someone says it can't because that's less than 2 months away..instead of flaming them acknowledge reality.<br />
<br />
peace out</div></div><hr />

well MoP will likely break yet another sales record and subscription record.... One or two quitters wont matter when so many new players come play this game... And ofc all the old players that start playing again. Sad, but this is how it looks like today :/ I wish I could say that I won't be buying this game, but then I would be lying to myself, so instead I am buying a collectors edition and forget I ever thought about quitting (until the game gets boring again)</div></div><hr />

If you're tired of paying and playing, then don't. Don't bother telling us. Because, really, I'm sure you're a great guy, but the community doesn't care who stops playing or what you do with your money.<br />
<br />
About that 'raking their subscribers', people have a choice to pay or not. Noone is forcing anyone to pay anything. Pretty much like everything else in life... if you want something you pay for it. Enough of the 'I QUIT BLIZZ SUCKS' posts, seriously. It gets old really fast.<br />

Thats right, I always find its best to tell if a game is fun or not by not experiencing it myself. I saw a commercial for Avengers and it was the same commercial I saw an hour before so I decided the movie sucked. I also missed the birth of my children because on Youtube it did not look like anyone was having any fun at all when they were in the delivery room.</div></div><hr />

for the first time ever, players will have the option to upgrade a pre-purchase to the all-new Digital Deluxe Edition which comes with all of the in-game items from the retail Collector’s Edition, including a World of Warcraft pet and mount, banner sigil and accent for Diablo® III, and Battle.net® portraits for StarCraft® II.<br />

<br />
THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND ALWAYS WILL BE EXACTLY 2 MONTHS BETWEEN ANNOUNCEMENT AND SHIP DATE<br />
<br />
this has been true of all WoW expansions, D3 and even GW2 and it's due to time constraints associated with pressing the master copy, final box specs/printing and shipping times to 1000's of retail outlets all over the world<br />
<br />
So next time, when you want it to come out in XXX month and someone says it can't because that's less than 2 months away..instead of flaming them acknowledge reality.<br />
<br />
peace out<br />
<br />
Actually it hasn't always been two months between announcement and release date for &quot;All&quot; WoW expansions. The release date for Burning Crusade was announced on Sept 11th, 2006 and the expansion released on Jan 16th, 2007. Four months between announcement and release.</div></div><hr />

Read the description of the mount on the Digital Deluxe page. It says you will be flying your new mount with your new Quilen pet by your side. So it doesn't expressly say you get the pet, but I think you will from that descriptin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except Blizzard said the pre-launch patch is only 2 weeks prior to launch this time.<br />
<br />
They could change their minds, but that's what they said a while ago.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Pre Mists of Pandaria Patch will be roughly two weeks before launch and bring simple rewards. It might involve a scenario with Theramore and the Alliance vs Horde theme. Chen Stormstout might also come to the local cities and get players excited about what is coming.<br />

Granted I live in the east coast so I'll still have 4 hours before I can play it but hey there's a benefit to being over here! ^_^</div></div><hr />

I don't blame you. You should be hesitant to support these assholes who are allowed to get away with charging you more than a full expansion's worth for a single content patch, then expect you to give 40 more. Not to mention on top of the sub fee you're charged out the ass for character services. Then you watch them run a cash shop with unique pets and mounts that should be obtained IN the game itself considering what you already pay.<br />
<br />
And yet people still push the myth that subscription guarantee you more &amp; better quality.</div></div><hr />

So it will be the longest beta afterall. Even longer than Cata beta. (days from start to game release: 160 &gt;&gt;&gt; 189) In addition DS becoming nearly as long as ICC was but with less bosses. At least I know when will it happen and don't feel like checking the news every few hours for possible release info.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard is so predictable =P<br />
<br />
too bad for them the pre-launch events are just lore-lite time fillers... i don't think GW2 will have a huge effect on the sales of the MoP box, i think GW2's potential threat to the WoW fanbase will be more based on sub drops when people cruise through the end game and realize they don't need to stay subbed to play a polish, content rich MMO</div></div><hr />

<br />
You obviously didn't play during Wrath. Outside of Ruby Sanctum (basically just 1 boss), which most casuals couldn't do, and hard core guilds had no real use for, there was a year gap from ICC release to Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Dragon Soul to Mists is 9 months. <br />
<br />
<br />
No one enjoyed doing ICC at the end of it's run just as much as no one enjoys doing DS now. No one should enjoy ANY raid 8 months later, it doesn't matter what kind of content is inside it.</div></div><hr />

Taking release day off is a waste of time. Lag, starting area congestion, server restarts, etc etc ... is not an efficient use of time for leveling. Now, taking Thursday and Friday off to be level capped, and running heroics by Teusday reset. Yes, that is totally an option</div></div><hr />

Heh yea i didn't even get to touch how mad the transfers and other services that OTHER games give players for free makes me feel. People really need to not feed a company like this.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sensa</div><div class="date">2012-07-25, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually it hasn't always been two months between announcement and release date for &quot;All&quot; WoW expansions. The release date for Burning Crusade was announced on Sept 11th, 2006 and the expansion released on Jan 16th, 2007. Four months between announcement and release.<br />
<br />
you're right I should have said &quot;at least&quot; 2 months between announcement and release because as BC showed monumental screw-ups can still happen after the release date is announced...but the basic point, which you seem to agree with, is that when attempting to predict release date you have to factor in that window of time for master copy/boxing/shipping which is at least 2 months whether you want it to be sooner or not.</div></div><hr />

Do you mean the date was delayed? The release window was delayed, but, once they announced an actual specific date, they kept it.<br />
<br />
Edit P.S.: Also, I wish people would stop with the Blizzard-will-release-X-Patch-to-compete-with-X-game nonsense. People accuse them of always doing it when, historically, only a couple patch releases (out of dozens) have even been remotely close to activity from their competitors.</div></div><hr />

No play it and feed the pricey horse. Main thing it's a huge waste and you don't see there taking advantage of you and your money. Play some other games that actually care about there customers. And not milking them to death.<br />
No high horse here just tired of a company with no respect for there customers just to line there pockets.<br />
<br />
Main thing its a trendy game like a IPHONE. Its in a pretty box but in the end its just a shity 5 icon phone with a stupid price tag. :)</div></div><hr />

Funny, I thought I could make up my own mind about what I want to spend MY money on, but according to you, thats not the case..<br />
<br />
Interesting.<br />
<br />
You seem to lack the understanding of what a company is all about...namely making money. If you had a company and a product that people wanted to pay for, would you offer it to them for free ? And dont say you would, cause no one including yourself would believe you anyway.<br />
<br />
Its a huge waste you say ? So what isnt a waste ? Going out drinking is also a waste...going fishing, shopping, to the movies - its all a waste in some form.<br />
<br />
And you also dont seem to understand that playing WoW doesnt actually lock you out from playing other types of games...I know, mind=blown, right ?<br />
<br />
Here is the fun part though. Its up to the individual what he or she wants to &quot;waste&quot; or spend their money on, and people like you saying that &quot;we dont get it&quot; and we are being &quot;taken advantage of and we dont even see it&quot; suggests thtat we are stupid and you are the all mighty saviour of the stupid, and people like that (thats you) piss me off with their high and mighty &quot;im better and smarter than you&quot; attitudes.<br />

Blizzard do free server transfers. If yours is as dead as you say, just wait until that rolls around.<br />

Really though, while I'm not as excited as I've been for past expansions, they are bringing some good changes to the game for 5.x. (I M O, that means In My Opinion, for you angry kids out there).<br />

So please gtfo and let people do what they want with their time and money and dont feel like you need to &quot;save&quot; us. We dont need saving. We are fine. Trust me.<br />

Really are you that blind? I am stating that they abuse there customers. Not saying you are stupid for playing. Play all you want. It used to be a great game before the cash factor came into affect. Play it and enjoy it. Just open your eyes to the back side which is a cash driven company that is really bad to there customer! Enjoy the extremely outdated graphics and content that they reuse over and over. Main thing is support other games and play other games and you will see what wow has become over the years and it's pretty sad what they do to there customers.<br />
<br />
And Question? How many years have you played wow? And would you not agree the expac should be free since you pay a sub and the graphics and content are less then sub par?</div></div><hr />

Interesting.<br />
<br />
You seem to lack the understanding of what a company is all about...namely making money. If you had a company and a product that people wanted to pay for, would you offer it to them for free ? And dont say you would, cause no one including yourself would believe you anyway.<br />
<br />
Its a huge waste you say ? So what isnt a waste ? Going out drinking is also a waste...going fishing, shopping, to the movies - its all a waste in some form.<br />
<br />
And you also dont seem to understand that playing WoW doesnt actually lock you out from playing other types of games...I know, mind=blown, right ?<br />
<br />
Here is the fun part though. Its up to the individual what he or she wants to &quot;waste&quot; or spend their money on, and people like you saying that &quot;we dont get it&quot; and we are being &quot;taken advantage of and we dont even see it&quot; suggests thtat we are stupid and you are the all mighty saviour of the stupid, and people like that (thats you) piss me off with their high and mighty &quot;im better and smarter than you&quot; attitudes.<br />
<br />
