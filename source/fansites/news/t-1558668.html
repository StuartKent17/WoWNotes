Warlords of Draenor - Weapon Enchant Transmogrification<br />
It looks like players who choose the enchanter garrison building will be able to change their enchant visuals or hide them completely. There may be a limited (https://twitter.com/TheCrafticus/status/492154020685836288) selection (https://twitter.com/TheCrafticus/status/492156397878927360) to choose from though.<br />

Warlords of Draenor - Ashran Feedback<br />
Greetings everyone! This is my first post on the forum as a blue poster. I’m Chris Kaleiki, a Game Designer on World of Warcraft. I work specifically on Ashran with some guy you may know -- Brian Holinka. I previously worked on class design, notably the design of the Monk.<br />
<br />
The feedback you guys are giving is fantastic! Well appreciated. I wanted to respond. <br />
<br />
Wall of text inc --<br />
<br />
I have feedback on the “Horde and Alliance Hubs” (aka the staging areas)<br />
The Horde and Alliance staging areas are still being worked on by the world team. As for Ashran the world PvP zone, they have very little relevance. You may see some random PvP skirmishes there in the same way you see skirmishes in any Horde or Alliance capital, but they’re not meant to be part of the overall world pvp zone. While we do want your feedback on those areas, the PvP team’s involvement is pretty minimal so I suggest directing them towards the general discussions in this forum rather than this specific discussion.<br />
<br />
I feel the size of Ashran is too small.<br />
During Ashran’s early development we debated whether the zone should be larger, but we ultimately landed on its current size after concluding that if the zone were too big your chances of running into the opposite faction in your day to day excursions would be quite low. We want there to be a feeling that you’re sharing a limited resource with the opposing faction, and you have to fight over that resource. The bigger the zone, the less the opposite faction’s presence matters, and the less tension and ultimately the less world PvP will transpire.<br />
<br />
That said, it could be possible that the zone could still stand to be larger. And if more players spill out into the side areas to where it gets too cramped, we may have to make changes. Keep in mind we also want to build onto Ashran in patch content.<br />
<br />
What is the philosophy behind Ashran?<br />
Ashran is a new type of PvP design. While it does have the spirit of old Alterac Valley, it’s not supposed to be purely an objective based map. Our goal here was to create situations in where players would engage in world PvP. These situations primarily are the outskirts areas, off the midlane.<br />
<br />
In beta it is understandable that players are not reward driven. But on live, we expect players to be driven by getting honor and other rewards for their characters. The PvE on Ashran will be the most rewarding in that regard. The idea is that Horde and Alliance will be fighting over completing the side objectives and spawning and that will create interesting PvP situations (especially since you can loot other players currency). Even within the current incarnation of Ashran on beta I’ve experienced small unexpected fights in the outskirts areas.<br />
<br />
We feel we’ve delivered on objective based win condition content through battlegrounds, but we haven’t delivered in giving players a sandbox environment where they can experience PvP similar to that of which you may have experienced before battlegrounds were created. We’re trying to do that with Ashran. <br />
<br />
One of my most memorable moments of world pvp before battlegrounds were introduced into WoW was when my guildmates were farming for the frostsaber mount in Winterspring. They were being ganked by a Horde guild over and over, so some of our guildies went to help them out. The Horde guild responded by sending more of their guildmates. Then other random guilds joined in. Eventually, there were so many players in that area we crashed the server. <br />
<br />
The spirit of that experience is what we’re trying to go for in a zone like Ashran.<br />
<br />
What’s the deal with the middle lane?<br />
The middle lane serves as a centerpiece of Ashran. It’s similar to that of Alterac Valley: a push/pull tug-of-war battle. While the road of glory isn’t exactly world PvP, this type of PvP is appealing to a number of players so we decided to include it in Ashran. It’s also nice to know that there is almost always going to be some battle going on there.<br />
<br />
The middle lane wont’ really be very rewarding in terms of honor or currency. And we intentionally don’t have a way to “win Ashran.” Storming the enemy base and killing their commander will give you some reward and an achievement, but it’s not the main focus of the zone. If your time in Ashran is within the middle lane and storming the enemy base, you’re mostly doing that for the intrinsic fun of it. <br />
<br />
What is the main objective?<br />
We envision that most players will be coming to Ashran to farm honor and rewards. You’ll do that by killing creatures and participating in the side events. Along the way you’ll find items that boost your characters power (such as the class books, scrolls, wands etc.) and we hope you’ll get some PvP fights.<br />
There is no objective like “cap and hold these points, run this flag, kill this guy” like our other objective based maps. We’ve found that more objective heavy maps lead to more predictable gameplay, which lead to less interesting unexpected PvP fights… which defines the idea of “world pvp.”<br />
<br />
That said, I would say some goals in the map would be as a faction to maintain the mage portals, warlock gateways, and spawn Fangraal/Kronus. They all serve to help your faction be more efficient in the zone.<br />
<br />
Why does Ashran not put you into a group/raid?<br />
Ashran is intended to simulate any other zone in WoW. If we put you into a huge group, that would insinuate that there is some global objective to win… which there really isn’t. We want you to be able to come to Ashran in a small group as you would in any zone to collect honor and other rewards. <br />
That said, I can certainly see the utility of having a raid group if you’re in Ashran to just do some casual PvP in the road of glory. For that, we will just leave it to players to create those groups naturally. It’s a bit anti-social to be forced into a raid group if you don’t want to be in one.<br />
<br />
Faction balance<br />
Balancing Horde and Alliance populations is a priority. Current on beta, there is no population enforcement. It’s something we’ll be monitoring and tweaking going forward.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind Ashran is still in development. There are bugs, things will change, items will be put in, new side objectives added etc. We hope you’ll revisit Ashran as the builds progress in beta.<br />
<br />
Phalanx, as a PvE Guy, one of the things I was looking forward to most was Ashran, but after messing around with it, that intrigue has worn out, I know you guys keep saying you don't want objective based gameplay, but in my opinion the best part of all of Ashran is the Minecart area at the Quarry, all the side areas should be like that, if they aren't already. I find myself there, more than the middle lane. The biggest and most glaring issue besides the lack of things to do out of the &quot;tug-of-war&quot; is the middle lane being what most would call a cluster.... it is not intuitive gameplay to have everyone just stack and spam, it isn't fun either, I get the tug-of-war ability, but if you want that, it needs to be matched with other things to do for people who do not want that and want Wintergrasp and Tol Borad back. As it stands Ashran feels LESS like Alterac Valley and more like Temple of Kotmogu, there is simply not enough to do around the zone (I am sure most of this can be attributed to the fact that it is beta.)<br />
There are &quot;PvP Events&quot; at each of the POIs. The minecart at the quarry, there's a &quot;cap the fires&quot; event at the tower, and a race event at the stadium. The burial ground event isn't live yet. We're glad you like those events, and they're still work in progress. We're going to work to highlight those more in the zone, and of course they'll also have rewards.<br />
<br />
I would reiterate that the goal of summoning Fangraal/Kronus could stand to feel more rewarding. Right now a decent tank can solo them given enough time. Perhaps something like a heal debuff aura or random target change timer in combination with a substantial damage increase would be cool to see. I want to see these guys on the field and hope that there is a raid group with me or nearby.<br />
They're going to get beefed up for the next build, and we're going to add to their abilities and correct to their pathing as well. The idea originally was for them to patrol the outskirts areas (since we didn't want to make the midlane the focal point), but it's something that can possibly change.<br />

Clarification on Highmaul/Foundry Boss Kill Order<br />
Highmaul has three completely optional bosses: Brackenspore, Butcher, and Tectus can be skipped if you like (a la Ignis or Razorscale in Ulduar).<br />
<br />
Foundry has no optional bosses, but consists of three separate wings that must be cleared to access Blackhand's Crucible (layout is more like Naxxramas).

As a blood DK main, I need to ask, Why remove Heart Strike and Rune Strike, but keep Plague Strike and Icy touch?<br />
Because they were redundant gameplay (with Pestilence/BloodBoil and Death Coil), whereas PS/IT are not. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/489811270434967552))<br />
Plus removing HS there are annoying gaps. Would love to see that brought back. Currently blood is so slow, boring<br />
You may have missed that you should be using Pestilence (aka Blood Boil) instead of Heart Strike. No rotation diff. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/489814089388945408))<br />
It's more of a flavor thing for me, I feel using a AOE attack on a single target fight is pointless.<br />
Heart Strike and Blood Boil are in Blood's rotation, and are already AoEs. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/489817282973949953))<br />

Most notable suggestion being having 2 separate eclipse power bars for Lunar/Solar that regenerate in 2 ways<br />
Extremely unlikely that we'd go in a direction that added significant learning complication, such as that would. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/489890218250481664))<br />
<br />
Are you guys still open to change/improve the new Eclipse system to provide more control for the player and depth for the spec?<br />
We have another change coming soon that we think will improve it a bit more. Hang tight for that. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/489889998099865600))<br />

Celestalon are you serious? You seriously want our mastery to only be good during certain situations?<br />
Tons of stats have situational strengths. And the situation where Sniper Training is good is the vast majority of time. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/489718524638556160))<br />

Why do all energy specs have to be restricted by energy? Already 4 specs that are, why can't WW stay unique and fastpaced(fun)<br />

seriously scared about such restricted Garrison customization.<br />
Customization is certainly cool, but as we have said, it's not the number one priority. Fun gameplay comes first.<br />

Have some customization options in the works: Monuments, garrison banners and racial guards to name a few. (mumper (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/491994440488071169))<br />
<br />
With the new follower AI Is it fully implemented in tier 2+ garrisons? They only patrol the garrison now, and nothing else<br />
Nope, still very much a work in progress. Tier 3 Alliance probably furthest along so far. (mumper (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/491994932492500992))<br />

Tech<br />
Any chance the pop-in distance can be increased for npcs?<br />
We get asked that a lot by design. We'd like to, but it's very hard on the servers. The area the server thinks you should see is 100 yards around you most of the time. But area increases with square of distance. So an increase of 50 yards (50%) means more than 2x work on the server. So not very likely in the open world in 6.0. As we continue to improve the code maybe later. (kurtismcc (https://twitter.com/kurtismcc/status/491794436284624896))<br />
Thats not too bad really, and makes sense r/e what I know about it. Would non-circular shapes for render distance be unfeasible?<br />
The math is really nice for circles and squares. We use circles. Considered ellipses for when server not loaded. Other things we can try. I was originally going to investigate some for 6.0, but ran out of time. Spatial hashing and other techniques more understood than when WoW first coded. Also things like update rate scale linearly. (kurtismcc (https://twitter.com/kurtismcc/status/491801603825885186))<br />
<br />
At the start of MoP, Chess became IMPOSSIBLE because cpu would take many moves faster than it should. Was actually caused by improving responsiveness of one of our systems, when chess was built assuming that delay. The fix was just to force the delay back into chess, but was hard to anticipate the specific problem. (pedrothedagger (https://twitter.com/pedrothedagger/status/491816229233909760))<br />

Ride the Iron Skyreaver - 40% Off This Week Only<br />

2014 World of Warcraft Arena North American Arena Tournament<br />
Do you have what it takes to compete on the big stage in the WoW Arena World Championship at BlizzCon 2014? We’ve got all of the WoW North American Arena Tournament information you need to set you on your path to global domination.<br />
<br />
Eight of the top 3v3 Arena teams from around the globe will compete for a chance to face off in the World of Warcraft Arena World Championship, taking place November 7 and 8 at BlizzCon 2014 in Anaheim, California.<br />
<br />
If you’re an Arena competitor, it’s time to hone your skills and get ready to fight hard for a spot in the event. We’ll be holding online qualifiers for North America* in the months to come—in order to be eligible, teams need to have an individual 3v3 Arena rating of 2,500 on the live realms by August 25, 2014 at 10 a.m. PDT.<br />
<br />
The North American Arena Tournament will use a double-elimination format to determine the top 3 teams. Beginning in the Nagrand Arena, each match will be played in a best-of-five format, with the losing team deciding the next map from the remaining pool of eligible maps. Each game will last until one team is eliminated or until 15 minutes have elapsed. When the dust settles, only the top 3 teams will move on to compete live at BlizzCon 2014.<br />
<br />
Eligible countries for the North American Arena Tournament include the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Mexico, Chile, and Argentina.<br />

<br />
I'm also pleased they're standing pat on customization. it's a miltiary garrison, it shouldn't have a ton of variation in the buidlings. Drapes, logos, monuments, and the guard choices are going to be more than enough.<br />
<br />
Here's an idea: You can &quot;Hire&quot; Faction guards! By default you can choose one of your Faction's races to guard your garrison, but with a quest or reputation, maybe you could hir Argent Crusader, or Shadow-Pan, or Earthen Ring guards. Heck you can have Argent Orcs guarding your Alliance fort! Old school: Timbermaw Furblogs! Oh that would be cool!</div></div><hr />

It is, implemented, it's just broken for what seems like most people. Requires Garrison <br />

For what i read, its going to be a older (in Azeroth time) movie, so I think it's going to be Orgrim not Go'el wielding the doomhammer.<br />

It's possible that they'll develop some additional lore for the weapon, perhaps make it an ancestral weapon of the Frostwolf clan that ended up wielded by Doomhammer's father. The movie will be a somewhat liberal adaptation, so it isn't necessarily canon to the game lore (in the same what the superhero movies aren't canon to the comic books).</div></div><hr />

Well when they changed the iconic and nostalgic golden and blue logo that tells you this is WARCRAFT, and pays homage to all the long time fans of the franchise (the majority of people who would see this movie) to metallic letters that look like the start of a Michael Bay movie, I would also be irked. Sure, it's not enough to keep me from watching the movie solely based on the logo, that would eb stupid. I just think this is a step in the wrong direction.<br />
<br />
It fuels my fears of this being another movie where the franchise it's based off of is terribly misconstrued in the cinematic adaptation. It's happened in the past with M. night Shymalan's The Last Airbender, and pretty much every one of Michael Bay's Transformer movies, and it seems to still be the current trend in the movie scene with that TMNT film coming out.</div></div><hr />

Why would they tie the Doomhammer to the Frostwolves? That would put everyone off. I mean, I know the movie isn't aimed solely at people familiar with Warcraft but that would be a complete misinterpretation of what Frostwolves are. Blackrock = doom, Frostwolf = doom - not so much.</div></div><hr />

As much as I hate over use of CGI (Staw Wars prequels, Transformer movies) I think this would be the best route to go down for a WC movie using WC style, I'm a bit worried how it will look in live action. Plus Blizzards cinematics are always extremely well done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can't compare a time period to something established for years though. In any case, time is not going to be a problem for Warcraft as (from books at least) everything spans in the period of 10 years.<br />
<br />
As for CGI - yes it would be amazing. Is it possible? No. The costs will be in the billions if the entire movie was CGI. I'm sure they won't let down and use CGI to add in the racial/distinct features.</div></div><hr />

Well, right now they're developing that you can have any of your faction's races as guards.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see them as the races and colors of the Neutral factions. <br />
<br />
I think it would be rather easy, as they all ready have basic guards for all the factions all ready (So Earthen Ring will choose the Shamantic Races from Cata, while Argent Crusade would have the Wrath-era races). <br />
<br />
I just think it would be neat as a way to let people who have worked for these older reps to get something of it, but its' only cosmetic.</div></div><hr />

The original Warcraft font is good for the franchise, but wouldn't work at all for a movie that is supposed to primarily draw in a crowd that is not familiar with the games.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because it looks like a logo for a cartoon. It would be idiotic to use it for the live action movie. It's a Hollywood production and a mainstream movie. It's not made just for people who know the games.</div></div><hr />

The worst part might be the shiny edges of the lower part of the letters and that the first and last letters hang lower than the rest, which as many have pointed out already, makes it look like Starcraft/Transformers and &quot;spacey&quot;. I don't care that much, since I'm sure the film is in good hands, but IMO there shouldn't be a problem using the concept of the established logo. Fonts with a less industrial and more medieval look, and making the C the character that stands out. If they need to make it less &quot;comicy&quot; than the original, they could make it look like letters fresh from the forge or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the concerns are quite lgitimate. &quot;The movie is not for the fans only&quot; should not serve as an excuse for complete disregard of classic and already established desings, and yes the logo alone is meaningful enough. If the fans don't see a recognisable logo the next thing you know the orcs don't look like Warcraft orcs, and that would suck big time.<br />

I'd be more concerned about that rather cheesy 1960 - 1970ish looking Alliance shield.<br />
This really reminded me at the first glance of those cheap looking ancient Greek mythology movies from the 60s/70s. <br />
But that's probably because it's been horrible pictures made with cellphones, and the items are stand alone with no context added to it. <br />
Legendary is known to make epic movies, and Duncan Jones doesn't have a reputation to be a &quot;junk food&quot; director. <br />
I don't think the movie is going to be bad at all.<br />
It's not gonna be a game adaption. For that, there's Twitch, Youtube and the likes, where one can watch real game action streamed.</div></div><hr />

But seriously, it doesn't look like any Warcraft logo I've seen, and if you're going to make a movie after a game, then perhaps using a similar font/style/theme would grant some synergy between the two. This looks like &quot;Warcraft: A Space Odyssey&quot;</div></div><hr />

That means, level 100 only. Garrison are a central part of the leveling experience, unless you skip questing altogether, and I think there are multiple ways to catch up if you didn't level in zones (aka pvp) with plans and stuff. So it basically just mean you will have to GO to your garrison if you want enchant xmog. Also, the message states that it will allow you to TRADE enchants for the same enchant with different look. Not sure what he meant by this but that could be: Allows enchant vellums to be traded for xmogged enchant vellums, to which you can send to your alts, without garrison and level 99 and lower.</div></div><hr />

They really don't at all. The ascender of the R doesn't have at all the same slant(and overall shape). The As are completely different. The C is totally different. The warcraft F is completely square while the Starcraft one is fragmented and has slants on its terminal and ascender.<br />
The only similarity really is the slant on the stem of the T.<br />
That being said they are both futuristic in style, which might be where the confusion comes from for a lot of people. They both have fairly square and sleek designs. But they don't look similar in the slightest if you actually look at the font.<br />
<br />

Pretty cool that it's finally going to be in the game, but a little shit that's it's going to be gated behind garrison nonsense. Actually, thinking about it a little thoroughly, it's total shit that it's a part of garrisons because garrisons aren't account wide, they're character specific, so that means for every character you want the option on, you have to go through garrisons. And unless they change it, which I imagine they will, you'll need to fly out to your garrison in a past expansion to access your enchant transmog functionality, if you even have it unlocked in the first place. Hooray for Warlords of Garrisons.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shockeye</div><div class="date">2014-07-24, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the movie logo quite a lot and I think it nicely communicates an accurate feel for what Warcraft is to a larger &quot;in the dark&quot; audience. The &quot;burning erosion&quot; effect also is a strong statement of events and rather strongly indicating that this is just the first chapter of a series. <br />
<br />
As for the Doomhammer and the Frostwolf brand, to me it's an indicator of what happens by the end of the movie, that it becomes Thrall's weapon. There's very likely a Doomhammer prop without the Frostwolf brand as well for when it is Ogrim's weapon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was my first thought on seeing the logo.<br />
<br />
The new design aesthetic caught my eye before the actual text, so I thought it was some other new IP being announced, then realized it said &quot;Warcraft&quot;, and I was like, 'dafuq?' :confused:<br />
<br />
As to enchants, the &quot;Hide Enchant&quot; option should simply be in the UI, like helms and cloaks.<br />
<br />
Changing the look of the enchant, sure, that can be at the xmog vendor or garrison or whatever, but not the actual hide option.<br />
<br />
That's kind of stupid.</div></div><hr />

lets speculate about the doomhammer thing. my thoughts are that its part of the 3rd film and we wont get to see it in the first film hopefully they are doing a trilogy like peter jackson did with lord of the rings but i guess might have to wait 20 years for the next bit anyway <br />
also i got an idea why not turn caverns of time into a last man standing bg for the tarren mill southshore massive and scrap ashran to the path of titans dance studio scrapheap<br />
and please for the love of god let me bet gold with my friends on hearthstone games this decade at the moment there is no reason to challenge your new friends you met on OQueue</div></div><hr />

worst case scenario it should be 'ok' imo. the directors track record is pretty awesome so far (if not very long), i loved both of his movies.</div></div><hr />

i really dont want to see 2.5 hours of orcs and humans politicizing then having a fight with some crappy love story thrown inbetween.<br />
<br />
i want to see an awful monster like arthas use the undead to savage a land and then end on a cliffhanger involving the possible demise of the orcs and humans. he should be the main character and villain.<br />
<br />
but i think critics will compare it to a crappier version of lord of the rings, &quot;orcs and humans having a struggle, generic love story, blah blah.&quot;<br />

<br />
Why did they change the Warcraft font to what closely resembles the Starcraft font? Are they trying to alienate established fans? What the movie producers and designers essentially did with the movie's font is the equivalent to Nike deciding that their Logo is randomly going to be upside down on one of their products. <br />
<br />
Warcraft's font is not only its logo but also its shorthand identity.</div></div><hr />

The logo already shows a departure from the atmosphere of Warcraft.</div></div><hr />

Arthas EVERYWHERE!!1! He's so cool and badass and his story is so epic and i'd have unprotected sex with him whawhawhaaaaa!1one!!1<br />
Too much Arthas, got fed up with him.<br />

I sense that it's one prop out of many Doomhammer props, this one being part of one narrative or event, separate from others.</div></div><hr />

If by good you mean stray in large ways from the source material then yeh LotR was good. LotRx3 were fun movies to watch but they were horrible adaptations of the books. I myself do not want them to do that to the WarCraft movie.</div></div><hr />

How many video games got adapted into good movies? Doesn't have to be Academy Award quality good, just something that you can sit down and watch and say &quot;yea that was cool, I'll probably get it on Blu-Ray later&quot;</div></div><hr />

I Think movies that we can say that was good: the first Mortal Kombat, Hitman, aside some errors, Prince of Persia, the visual design was awesome and some of the characters :), Max Payne also.</div></div><hr />

I would beg to differ. Doomhammer's Doomhammer was had a long shaft as he used it as a 2h weapon. Green Jesus gave it a shorter one so he can use it as a 1h and 2h Doomhammer. Plus this hammer has a the frostwolf logo.</div></div><hr />

The movie should be about the story, and you should use design elements where they make sense. But other than the hammer the sword and the shield look to ornamental. It doesn't look like anything you'd actually take into battle. I am now worried that this movie will have the fate most other video game movies have and thats to pay to much homage to the design and mechanics of the game. I hope I'm proven wrong.</div></div><hr />
