Puggable raids<br />
No matter what Blizzard says, making new raid tiers undoable by pugs is total garbage. Personally I have absolutely no problem doing older raids, but seriously is making the first 2 or 3 or maybe 4 bosses of a new raid easy all that much to ask?<br />
We actually do have a measurement of sorts in place like this. It might not be to your expectations if you want to successfully pug half of the bosses during the first week they're available, but it's worth mentioning it does exist.<br />
<br />
Whenever designing a new raid dungeon, we have a basic 1-5 scale we use to rate each encounter in terms of complexity. While complexity may not be synonymous with difficulty in some cases, it is in most. So for an example of what we're looking at, every encounter in Molten Core would be a 1 on our scale in terms of complexity, while bosses like Cho'gall and Sinestra are each considered a 5. (For an example of when a complex fight might not translate into difficulty once the mechanics are known by the raid, Flame Leviathan is also a 5 -- there are a LOT of mechanics in that fight.)<br />
<br />
So, using those few examples, I'll say we try to create the raids of today with the average complexity of all boss encounters dialed in around 2.5. We have to balance out the really complex encounters with encounters which have more simplistic mechanics. Again though, that doesn't always mean they're less difficult.<br />
<br />
To define complexity, we're talking about all of the spells, abilities, scripts, or mechanics triggered during each fight. So if you look at a boss like Lucifron (1) in Molten Core, there are fewer than 5 mechanics in the whole fight. Meanwhile, Beth'tilac (5) in the Firelands has well over 100 mechanics (not just spells and abilities, but triggers for webs, adds, etc.).

<br />
Melee Friendly Encounters<br />
Your reinterpretation seems to suggest that we're ignoring the issue when that's not the case. The take away from the quote should be that we were aware of the issues regarding ranged vs. melee, but that didn't mean that warriors got to outclass the other melee dps while we addressed them.<br />
<br />
We're certainly aware that encounter design in the previous tier ended up feeling melee unfriendly. As a result, we were careful to include more melee friendly fights in the Firelands raid. We'll also make adjustments if things feel off in this tier of content (though that doesn't necessarily mean that melee and ranged will be tied for the top spot on every boss fight).

Frenzied Regeneration Tooltip<br />
Frenzied Regeneration tooltip is reading 15%. It should be, and is, 30%.<br />
That's a tooltip bug. We got some nifty new (and complicated) tech for tooltips up and running for Cataclysm, which allows us to do things like make tooltips reflect talents and glyphs in a highly accurate fashion, as opposed to the static tooltips we used to have. Overall it's a good thing, but when a system gets more complicated there are more opportunities for bugs to show up as a natural consequence.

Rogue Deadly Poison Stacking and DPS Ramp Up<br />
You've got a point.<br />
<br />
While we're unlikely to eliminate dps ramp up time for rogues altogether, we're sensitive to the fact that rogues require multiple methods to do so, when combo points do a pretty good job of handling that job. We will look at methods of streamlining rogue dps ramp time at some point in the future.

<br />
Cheat is probably the wrong word, but they abuse a loophole in the system and used it to their advantage, which is further proven by both this hotfix and Blizzard's removal of them from the raid instance. They should recieve punishments, especially since blizzard had to actually intervene and stop what they were doing.</div></div><hr />

Basically, they have been calling thrash on paragon for stacking classes for #1 Hnef, and now they simply do the same 10x worse. Its essentially the same as Sabotaging someone because they sabotaged you. Endless loop and noone gets better from it. <br />

@Boub, will you still keep STARS as being the first guild to kill Heroic Shannox in the hall of fame, despite all of this?<br />
I don't see why not....they only used a Blizzard service to get to the boss. There wasn't anything they used to make the boss any easier or used any kind of program bug. For all intents and purposes they were the first in the world to kill the boss in a live server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They made the boss easier by having better gear on some of their raid members. Actually, probably all, depending on how much reputation they had. True, they were first - but they also used an exploit in the system to do so. Unless Blizzard goes to a true free-to-play system (right now, it's more of a &quot;first hit is free&quot; by being limited to level 20) spending money should not give you an advantage. The only similar thing at the moment is race/faction changes, but those advantages are relatively small compared to being able to raid the highest tier instance twice in a week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you remember before, you could queue as a full 5-man group with a tank, enter the instance, tank would leave and you would be placed at the front of the queue again. They patched that so that if the tank left, everyone who queued with him would leave aswell.<br />
<br />
I think probably the more recent change is because it was possible for guilds to exploit the system, whereby a tank and dps would queue as 1 group, then another guild group of 3 would also queue. When the instance began, the tank could leave, his party-friend would be kicked aswell, and the remaining (other) group of 3 would be placed at the front of the queue again. <br />
<br />
I'm thinking more along the lines of queue's for specific dungeons here, rather than just randoms.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But the only reason they even had access to the boss was because they paid real money for it. They bought their way into additional attempts that other guilds would not have access to without similar expenditures. Unless you believe that Blizzard should, in fact, sell such in-game advantages for real world money, their kill is not legitimate in terms of any kind of competition. <br />
<br />
If you don't have a problem with Blizzard selling in-game advantages, then I suppose there's no reason for you to object to what Stars did.</div></div><hr />

If you are going to use the actions of Blizzard to base your opinion on whether they should be punished keep in mind that they still kept their loot and kept their achieve for killing a heroic boss, which is Blizzard's decision to make.<br />

Loot not taken away yet. You seem to forget its the weekend and there priorities right now are hotfixing things that come up. No doubt if they removed Stars from the instance and no doubt will &quot;investigate&quot; any rule breaking.

If you don't have a problem with Blizzard selling in-game advantages, then I suppose there's no reason for you to object to what Stars did.<br />
If we're talking officially and technically then they never did anything wrong. They didn't make the boss any easier in difficulty than any other guild will encounter it at, transferring didn't give them any power ups, and pretty much anyone could get the rep gear that they obtained. Also since any other guild could have done the same if they so wished to there wasn't a true &quot;advantage&quot; over anybody else. Morally on the other hand it was a distasteful move but a clever one at that and I think most people just don't want to accept the fact that they worked the system. Hey it happens in this country's judicial system all the time and nothing is done about it. If Blizz takes the gear and achieve away that's fine but either way they killed the boss first and at the end of the day that's all that matters....they got their money's worth.</div></div><hr />

Why is that? did they break any blizzard rules? <br />
<br />
WoW already has a decrease player base. And 5 million out of the 11 million subscribers are from China. <br />
<br />
Punishinng STARS for faction change is like to tell their biggest target market to not use their paid service. <br />
<br />
What company would do that? lol<br />
<br />
And what is this World first fuss? It is not even an achievement, but just the unofficial competition between tops guilds.<br />
<br />
Blizzard CBA to make a serious call about World first, because of the unfairness in PTR and Realm patch time. <br />
<br />
Thats why the only offcial achivement is Realm first. Other than that, It is just all guilds' fanboys fighting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Using blizzard holes to reset your Raid ID is still cheating, since u already have done the normal bosses.<br />
The New System implemented by Blizzard is flexible yes, but since noone is permitted or allowed to both do a normal and a heroic run of the same instance in the same week, this is cheating. Not just smart thinking.<br />

What troubles me is the pace these bosses are going down in. They seem a joke, on normal its nothing but a content filler... and ofc bosses will change a bit on hc, but seeing their changes on paper, it looks like its gonna be a roll over instance.. without any real challenges. I loved stepping into the instance, looked awesome tbh.. but since bosses just started rolling over. 1 shot shannox 3 shot Ryo 2 shot Beth 10 shot Alys (yeah tornados seemed to make people panic a bit the first 9 tries) 2 shot Baleroc 5 normal bosses = 18 tries max and they were all down... and we were not even as fast as our g1. Im sure other guild have perhaps a max of 10 tries total on 5 bosses. And they said they would never do another ToC again.. well we certainly got it, just looking a bit different.</div></div><hr />

No1 should of been able to enter heroic until next week but there's a bug with faction change that causes it to reset lockouts and Stars took advantage of that bug and started on heroics the same week they cleared normal.</div></div><hr />

There's nothing that can drop for a rogue in there so it will not hurt me, but i can't understand why someone would be upset of people spending an eve on trash have a chance on epics. Might give ah some reasonable prices back instead of all the goldbuyer amounts. Today i saw a crossbow on ah for 60k, that's just not normal imo. A daily gives about 20g, so a person getting a random drop thinks he is entitled to get gold for it someone else needs to do 30000 daily's for. If that seems logic to anyone out there, be my quest, but it's definately not normal to want stuff like this happening. Also getting mats for a crafted item is already hard, but now the patterns probably won't even drop anymore so you can better just wait on a boss drop, making all the patterns useless. And I'mm not even speaking of the social experience ripped away, by small guilds joining together for rep runs.</div></div><hr />

I don't think the drop rates were insane.<br />
<br />
I think the amount of trash you could clear, in a short relative time without ever pulling a boss was insane.<br />
<br />
I hope you understand that ensidia using saronite bomb bug was nothing compared to this. Ensidia was just exploiting game mechanics but stars went as far as using real money to get in game advantage (and no, EU/US guilds can't do the same, blizzard has stated that your ID should not reset when FCing). Also you aren't in any of the top guilds so could you please cut the crap about them getting money out of playing wow, well maybe ensidia. If you can live off with t-shirts and some computer parts then maybe they have advantage.</div></div><hr />

Could you please leave normal mode to pugs and if you like challenge then stick with heroic mode where you get better rewards. We have two different difficulties for a reason.<br />
<br />
Do you think it's &quot;normal&quot; that even the normal difficulty of your raids is only done by a small % of the player base? Is it really &quot;normal&quot; that a hight % of the players don't raid at all and it's not because they are bad or don't want to. Personally I think the raid model of cataclysm is complete fail and it's not my fault so please look into a mirror.<br />

Products are made for the people, not the other side around. Human gen manipulation is illegal, if your game philosophy fails, your game has to change and not the people.</div></div><hr />

Simple. All this World First race is actually a race - competition. And usual competitions are made for equals to find the best. Dozens of guilds could get 7\7 normal on the day of release. Same dozens might get 7\7HC in a couple of days. Best will be more skilled\lifeless(jk)\determined. But they would all start equal. What have Stars done? They paid for their kill. What's the point of buying an advantage that ruins the competition? Disqualification. And Blizzard confirmed it - they disabled heroic. Why? After Stars, dozens of guilds around the world could faction change and get Blizz a good bunch of money for simple content progression. But still, Blizzard seems to care about competition, not cash(thankfully). Why Stars were not banned and likely would not be? Because, as many people said, they did not do anything against the rules. Paid the money, killed the boss fair. It's just that it was not expected, nor supposed to happen. They wanted to be first - but they are just treated as cheaters now. And I agree with it. They will keep their loot or realmfirst achieve - they paid for it. But the real competition will begin next week, when all normal, sane enough guilds will get Kills as fast as possible. I expect that most charts will still show Stars as World First Shannox, but truth is - the World Second Kill would be the First. If they have killed Shannox, they have unfair advantage of nearly wipeless repeat of it after reset, so it is NOT qualified. They can still get other World Firsts - if they win in the LIVE competition, not paid one.</div></div><hr />

Just to comment your first few sentences here... <br />
<br />
Something that's done cannot be undone. They got the World First kill and there's no changing that. Their methods were shady and their motives obvious, but there's no changing the fact that they did kill the bosses fair and square. Would they have deserved the first kill? We'll never know.<br />
<br />
But eventually it comes down to how the World First kills are measured. In the case of WoWProgress (http://www.wowprogress.com/), it was not counted as a World First kill. <br />

Well... Considering how the top EU and US guilds got the chance to test almost all (if not all) bosses on Test Realm I'd say they are perfectly even.</div></div><hr />

Clearly said that it will be considered World First nontheless.</div></div><hr />

Tell that to Ensidia regarding their World First LK Heroic kill and try to explain to people how utilising an exploit is &quot;fair and square&quot;.<br />
<br />
Just because someone is able to do something through the incompetance/ignorance/lack of foresight of others does not excuse those that take advantage.<br />
<br />
In this particular case, a guild paid to transfer their characters. That's all they paid for. The side-effect of it allowing them to bypass the gating system for heroics is an unintended one. Utilising ANYTHING that is unintended is an exploit. <br />
<br />
What this actually boils down to is honesty. STARS lacked it by doing this. Ensidia lacked it with the Saronite Bombs exploit. Paragon almost got their world first Sinestra kill using an exploit too, however they were honest enough (or rather, they learnt from Ensidia's mistake) to not actually take advantage of this. They intentionally wiped when they saw what Dark Simulacrum was doing. That, in short, is what makes this really sad. The members of STARS must be either the most ignorant end-game raiding guild out there right now, or the most retarded. How could they actually exploit this knowing full well what happened to Ensidia.<br />
<br />
Are world firsts really worth losing your account over? Temporarily or permanently? There's a grasp on reality that is missing here.</div></div><hr />
