Sunwell Plateau<br />
Small update, Tigole seems to post tons of nice things tonight, here is an ETA for the Sunwell Plateau and Sunwell Isle.<br />
Sunwell is coming along nicely. It will be on the PTR shortly after 2.3 goes to the live realms. We still need to perfect 2.3 a bit on the PTR.<br />
<br />
The 5 person dungeon is complete and the 25 person raid instance is progressing nicely. There's also a cool &quot;public&quot; area featuring brand new daily quests called Sunwell Isle.</div></div><hr />

It takes a slight bit of work to grind up revered, honored can be completed before you even hit 70. It's going to be depressing. On the good side, que's will be full of people interested in doing heroics, but the majority won't be skilled enough for them. You're going to have to turn down a decent amount of people, but meh. Blizzard is probably doing this to ensure easy badges for 2.3's heroic rewards. &gt;.&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Depends on their gear level. If you are tanking/healing, you are likely revered with the faction anyway. I just don't want to see a bunch of people in blues/greens in the LFG. Time to go back to /who + Friends list to find people to group with. <br />
<br />
The only good thing that comes of it is people who are geared enough, but didn't get rep with a faction or two. But those are rare and far between now.</div></div><hr />

No joke. Is it *really* that hard to get to revered? I HATE PvE, but I was damn close to revered with all major factions before I even hit 70.<br />
<br />
Removing the attunement requirements for raid dungeons is one thing - I think the idea of an ungeared group jumping into TK and getting slaughtered is funny - but relaxing the requirements for heroics? Have fun pugging those, now.</div></div><hr />

I suppose at lvl 80, lvl 70 heroics won't be all that hard eve in greens. Hell, taking into account the superior lvl and new gear, even in whites or greys :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This attitude is seriously depressing. Yes, if your tank and healer seriously outgear the instance then they can carry any bunch of green geared DPS to success, however, if the tank and healer are geared to the point where with a group equally geared they can complete the instance then bringing along undergeared DPS will lead to fights lasting far longer than they need to which in turn leads to the healer going OOM before the end of the fight and the inevitable wipe. <br />
<br />
On the other side a lot of people need to get over themselves here. Pugging is not nearly as bad as it is made out to be and often can be a lot of fun. Yeah you get the odd 5 hour wipefest that ends before you reach the 3rd boss in whatever instance but just as often you get great groups of good people where everything just works perfectly and the run is all the more pleasing because there was that chance at the start before you knew everyone that it could have been a disaster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Exactly. This is all to close the gear gap when Wrath comes out.<br />
<br />
What happened before TBC came out? PvP went to an honor system to a.) Make outlands a bit easier to lvl, and b.) To keep many occupied ('cept naxx guilds) since due to lack of new content.<br />
<br />
Blizz learned, imo, to have players feel more involved with the game. Give players new goals. Arena gear -&gt; Honor pts, and attunement downgrades. Keep people occupied with some aspect of the game = more playing = more $$.<br />
<br />
Where will they go after Sunwell Plateau? I don't know how far Wrath is coming, but let's be sure that it will be pushed out when they've exhausted motivation for players. Then the new talent trees will be pushed live (patch 3.0), followed by a month or so where they fix what they can for Wrath's release.</div></div><hr />

And if you really think about it, you have all the kids that can play alot... hence easily revered, but are bad at playing their charictor. Then you have all the mature people that cant play as much due to work and responsibilities, hence freindly and honored. That can play their charictor just fine.

Gear is not overrated. I would rather have a mage with 900-1000 spelldamage than a mage in blues with 500. Saves me time, and makes for a smoother run. Going into kara with T6 is just making it a faster and effortless run.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fiffer86</div><div class="date">2007-11-01, 08:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Remeber when the BC first came out. Before people where runing Heroics. They would be all decked out in their DS3 and instance gear. But you had everyone grinding for Rep, just to do Heroics. That proved that Reveard was too high of a requirment for heroics. Progression was saposed to be Normal&lt;Heroic&lt;=Kara&lt;25mans. But to alot it just went from Normal+70 quested gear + Arena Gear&lt;Kara... Completly skiping grinding out the rep for Heroics. Thats what i did, and i still have no plan to run heroic's. Maybe now that they are lowering the requirments to Honored, i might be intrested in running them. And just FYI, im Honored, prob freindly with most of the instance factions. I know for a fact im not reveared with a single one. Yet my gloves (T4), MH (aldor sword), OH (gladiator sword), Bracers and Back (pvp rewards), and one ring are all epic. Then my chest and pants are DS3, helm is the lvl 70 quested helm (best blue helm non epic imo). So really the worst parts of my gear is my belt and throwing weapon. Their both lvl 69, and 70 greens... but their better then the lvl 70 quested belt (because of lack of stamina). And if you took Kara out of the question, i had the Arc 70 blue gloves, and some 68 blue necklace. I dont know about everyone, but when people first started running Kara on my server, everyone was talking about how heroics took more time to get &quot;atuned for&quot; then Kara. Personaly i feel this change should have hapend a long time ago. So sure you might be getting some people that are just hiting 70, that wil want to run Heroic's. But at the same time you will be gaining the many people like me. That have run Kara, are over geared for Heroics, yet would run them for that epic drop at the end, and the marks. And if you are really all that woried about non geared people be more spacific in your tells. &quot;LF tank for Heroic Mech, require majority of blues or epics or you will get the boot!&quot; And to be honest, i run into way more non-prot warrior that have plenty of good gear, yet cant hold agro worth crap, then players that are in all greens.</div></div><hr />

<br />
don't forget that people have jobs and wifes and kids maybe.. we don't all have time to play wow whenever we like.. some people can only do like 1/2 instance runs per day or maybe only a few per week, and it would be nice for those to get the fun of running heroics without actually Farming the reputation.<br />
<br />
but I totally agree that there is no point in running heroics with people that just dinged honored, since most of them just dinged 70 (if you quested your way to 70 that is :P and did all kind of quests that give you rep with numerous factions)<br />
<br />
and ofcourse 'I don't do pugs' .. PuG's (pickup groups) suck! they mostly have people that don't give a flying fck about others in the party, or just leave the party whenever they like (mostly after the first or second boss, so it's impossible to find a replacement if you are doing heroic :P), or they spam the party chat with &quot;DK??&quot; or &quot;SWE??&quot; the whole run because they can't speak a word english :P(gotta love ally players) also grouping with guildys and/or friends is more fun as you know if your are going to blast trough the instance or not :P</div></div><hr />

As nice as the have a life thing is, the people that have little time to play likely don't have the gear to do heroics anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People who don't have alot of time to play CAN get good enough gear for Heroics, but it'll be crafted or quested - like my stuff - if they put in that little bit of effort. Sadly alot won't and PuGs heroics will be a nightmare. I tanked a few recently (got the CF key by 68), had no problems, but then I was with a group of people, from my guild, who know what to do and how to play. My suggestion would be to get a group of people you know and trust, and heroic groups will be a fun experience.</div></div><hr />
