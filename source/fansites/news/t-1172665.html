Valor of the Ancients Buff<br />
Mists of Pandaria is going to make it easier for you to earn Valor points (http://www.wowdb.com/currencies/396-valor-points) on your alts once your main character is capped for the week. The Valor of the Ancients (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/130609) buff increases the Valor earned on all of your characters on a realm by 50%, after one character has capped for the week. This comes along with another change to Valor points that limits the amount you may hold at any time to 3,000 per character. <br />

Jaina Audio for Theramore Event<br />
One of the recent beta patches added some more audio for Jaina during the Theramore event. If you haven't already listed to the previous audio, listen to it first (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JinS53T2kc)! See the long standing thread (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1161795-Alliance-Dalaran) about Jaina in the Mists of Pandaria forum if you are interested in more speculation and discussion of the lore!<br />

Beta Class Balance Analysis<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/277-Warlock))<br />
There is some major bug going on with Fel Flame and Corruption &amp; UA. Tagging a target with Fel Flame seems to cause Corruption &amp; UA to over double in damage.<br />
Warlock DoTs are incorrectly increasing their damage. This is a bug, and will be fixed in the next build.<br />
<br />
Could a blue poster please confirm/deny this bug, or if it's intended? It looks like the 50% extra damage DOTs aren't benefiting from Spell Power buffs. It says 50% of normal periodic damage in the tool tip, so if this is intended, it's a pretty hard nerf from the original MG effect.<br />
This was the aforementioned bug with Fel Flame approximately doubling the damage of Corruption, which was unintended (and doesn’t apply to the extra ticks granted by MG). For doing target dummy and theorycrafting testing, it’s probably best for you to not use Fel Flame as Affliction (unfortunately, Demonology has no such way to avoid extending Corruption). This bug has nothing to do with spellpower. <br />
<br />
We understand that this bug is significantly skewing impressions of the Warlock specs, and hope to have a new build up to fix this soon.<br />

Glaive Toss incurs a 1.5s global cooldown, unlike the 1s incurred by any other direct damage hunter ability. Is this intended?<br />
I've noticed and fixed that yesterday, actually. Fixed for the next build.<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/276-Shaman))<br />
So, if I am reading this correctly, on targets below 35% HP, each Chain Heal jump should have a 50% change to proc Earthliving, and each Healing Rain tick should have a 30% chance to proc Earthliving? Is this correct, or was the datamined change to Earhliving Weapon actually the removal of the 80% increased proc chance on Chain Heal and Healing Rain?<br />
This is correct.<br />
<br />
Is there any chance the developers could enlighten us as to Healing Rain's chance to proc Earthliving Weapon? It seems as though Chain Heal's is 0.2 x 0.25 = 0.05 (i.e. the chance is reduced by the maximum number of targets). Healing Rain is 0.2 x ??? = ???. <br />
<br />
Either number will help me immensely! I am getting anywhere from 5.3 - 8% chance when testing it myself, and I just can't make these numbers reconcile with anything logical like &quot;number of targets in the healing rain&quot; or &quot;number of targets at which the DR cap begins to apply&quot;. I'm interested in the proc chance when we are *above* 35% health. From there I can work out the rest. Thanks! <br />
Earthliving has a 20% base chance to proc, and an additional 80% (additive, total of 100%) if the target was below 35% HP when the triggering heal landed. After that, the chance is multiplied by 0.3 for Healing Rain, and 0.5 for Chain Heal. <br />
<br />
For example, a chain heal on a healthy target has a 10% chance to trigger Earthliving. A Healing Rain tick on a healthy target has a 6% chance to trigger Earthliving. <br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/272-Mage))<br />
Here’s another bit of info I want to pass on sooner rather than waiting for a new build to get to you all, about Arcane Mages.<br />
<br />
One of the defining characteristics of Arcane Mages has been that they can trade more mana for more damage, at a decreasing efficiency. In other words, they can play conservative, and use their mana as frugally as possible in order to maximize sustained damage. Or, they can play aggressively and increase their DPS now, in exchange for lower sustained damage over the course of the whole fight. <br />
<br />
Arcane’s sustained damage is about where we want it (as well as Fire and Frost), barring some minor tweaks perhaps. But, they’re currently playing very high on their Arcane Blast stacks. The goal is to have their rotations change significantly based on which level 90 talent they pick. An Arcane Mage with Invocation should play very aggressively and frequently stop to recharge their batteries. An Arcane Mage with Rune of Power should generally play rather conservative, but stay at relatively high mana to maximize Mana Adept. And with Incanter’s Ward, an Arcane Mage should generally play the traditional mix of conserve/burn/evocate.<br />
<br />
What we’re actually seeing are all three styles playing much more aggressively than we’re aiming for. There’s effectively a ceiling of just how much you can convert more mana into more damage. Invokers are playing so aggressively that they never drop their Arcane Charges at all, Rune users are staying at a 4 stack for a majority of the time, and Incanters are able to play more aggressively during their conserve phases and burn longer.<br />
<br />
In order to try to solve this, we decided to try raising the ceiling. So, in the next beta build, you’ll find the max Arcane Charges has been raised from 4 to 6, and the damage increase per stack is back up to 25% from 20%. I’d like to emphasize that the goal of these changes are to create the gameplay flexibility that we’re hoping for there to be with Arcane, not to change Arcane’s overall DPS. There will likely need to be additional changes after this to readjust their damage back to where we want it. Feedback about how it feels, and theorycrafting analyzing the effects this has on them are especially appreciated.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/269-Death-Knight))<br />
Also, a little tidbit for DKs who kept reading through all that Mage stuff: Blood Tap is back off the GCD in the next build. <br />
<br />
Doing LFR I realized that my bloodworms were doing about 35% of my healing done (compared to live, where it does less than ~5%.). I was also competing against healers on healing done. (I was averaging out to 40k HPS on the stone guards, compared to other healers who are just a bit higher.) Is this intended?<br />
Nope, it wasn't intended. Bloodworms were getting significantly more health (and therefore healing) from pet scaling than intended. For theorycrafters, they dropped from 25% to 6% of the Death Knight’s max health. <br />
<br />
Thanks for letting us know, this has been fixed for the next build.<br />

If I purchase the MoP CE, will I get the mount and pet on all my accts, or just the one that's a CE? <br />
It applies to all licenses attached to your Battle.net account. <br />
<br />
So if you have 2 wow accts, you get the mount and pet on both? Even if you onky make one a CE? <br />
That's how it should work as long as they're all on the same Battle.net account. (Twitter (https://twitter.com/CM_Zarhym/status/231465047682068480))<br />

Computers - Setup of the Month (by chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud))<br />
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud) will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
Hard drive prices are slowly declining, but are still above the pre-flood prices, so now is still a good time to buy a SSD. The current SSD prices are still slowly moving downward (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/august/ssdgraph.gif), with most under $1 per gigabyte now. A few sales have even gone under 50 cents per gigabyte, so look for something on sale!<br />
<br />
Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 3770K and should spend that money elsewhere.<br />

Are you referring to D3? Cause if so yes many people dropped their wow subs to play it. The expansion was pretty much done by the time that D3 came out so why not take a wow break and get your Diablo time in between content in wow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What's the difference between all the versions i see on amazon?<br />
<br />
EVGA GeForce GTX 560 1024 MB GDDR5 PCI Express 2.0 2DVI/Mini-HDMI SLI Ready Graphics Card, 01G-P3-1460-KR<br />
EVGA GeForce GTX560 SE 1024MB GDDR5 SLI Ready Graphics Card (01G-P3-1464-KR)<br />
EVGA GeForce GTX 560 Superclocked 1024 MB GDDR5 PCI Express 2.0 2DVI/Mini-HDMI SLI Ready Graphics Card, 01G-P3-1461-KR<br />
EVGA GeForce GTX 560 Superclocked 1024 MB GDDR5 PCI Express 2.0 2DVI/Mini-HDMI SLI Ready Graphics Card, 01G-P3-1463-KR<br />
EVGA GeForce GTX 560 Superclocked 2048 MB GDDR5 PCI Express 2.0 2DVI/Mini-HDMI SLI Ready Graphics Card, 02G-P3-1469-KR<br />
<br />
Why the superclocked 1463-KR costs 160$ and the other 2 superclocked costs 200-230 $ ?<br />
Why the superclocked version 1463KR (that i think should be better than the stock one 1460KR) costs less ?<br />
I'd like to buy a gtx 560 because i have 9600gt and the gtx570 for the little performance gain over the 560 costs way too much (300$) and i never buy the last born because it sucks to spend 500$ on a card that's being upgraded 1 month later....<br />
<br />
Which one is the best between 1463KR and 1460KR? and Why?? (hoping it can be purchased from EU too)</div></div><hr />

I'm personally no WoW hater, I still play it every day, and I still find the daily blink very bad.<br />

<br />
I will be enjoying Guild Wars 2 this month an then ill be enjoying MoP the month after and then jump between both depending on my mood and enjoyment. Man..... Life is good. i'm also getting engaged 25th this month so many good things near the end of this year I cannot complain :)<br />
<br />
Yep i liked this comic a lot. Im also not a star wars fanboy so that's probably why........Bad taste would have been someone making a joke about the shootings this afternoon, Sw:ToR has been bleeding out for 7 months.<br />
<br />
Oh and Congrats.<br />

Not really SWTOR, but BIOWARE as one entire studio failed. I feelsad that Diablo 3 developers chose to mirror themselves at BIOWARE instead of THEIR OWN COMPANY.<br />

Perhaps you should just sell $60 copies of WoW w/o a sub so you can pretend like it was a successful game? If D3 had subs they'd have to tell investors they fucked up but instead they can act like it was huge success because they abused a legendary name by selling shit in a box w/ no need for regular commitment to prove it was actually a good title. That's two games burning people on Blizzard franchises. MoP will never bring the numbers back to WoW's peak and the numbers will drop even faster than Cata's plummet after, at most, 3-4 months into MoP.</div></div><hr />

If you think Jay Wilson had the final say on anything you don't get how big company's work. Hell even small company's lead dev's have other people over them that give the final ok on there games. Big company's just have more &quot;Leaders&quot; especially publicly traded ones.<br />
<br />
I would bet that Jay didn't like the way the game was being made but was forced to do it by shareholders and his boss.<br />
<br />
Same thing with Bioware i bet they new it wasn't a complete game but EA forced it out the door anyway, with the we'll patch it later attitude that so many game company's have nowadays.<br />
<br />
Hopefully they both learned there lesson to actually listen to the dev team when they say its not working or isn't ready instead of forcing things.<br />
<br />
<br />

If you wanted to spend more, a larger SSD would be helpful, as would more mechanical drive storage if you need it. A faster graphics card isn't worth the additional cost, as the GTX 670 overclocks to GTX 680 speeds. Also, the 3770K is overkill unless you are doing something that needs the Hyperthreading. Save your money and upgrade again later, this is about as high end as most people need. <br />

Going &quot;THIS IS DUMB CUZ BOTH GAIMS ARE DYING LOLOLOO&quot; is .... wow.<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft isn't in a tailspin/massive losses mode. It's an approaching-8(!!!)-year-old game that posted a 10% loss of subscribers. If it was actually having troubles, you'd be seeing very OBVIOUS signs of a corporate mandate to re-order the game for expanded profits for a rapidly declining subscriber base. <br />
<br />
AKA, what EA is doing to SWTOR.<br />
<br />
That's the point of the comic. It's laughing at people who actually think a temporary 1 million sub loss for WoW is a death knell, especially since the 1 mil sub loss is attributed to a launch of another Blizzard game during a period where there's no new game content in WoW. <br />
<br />
Those subscribers will come right back the moment MOP is released. I don't think there's many doubts about that in anyone's mind. Only thing we're actually seeing is a really strong case of this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-purchase_rationalization</div></div><hr />

Fortunately not all games employ the same tactics as Blizzard do to keep their players 'entertained'. Progression can be fun without having to run instance after instance after instance just to save up enough tokens to buy that shoulder piece.</div></div><hr />

With 11 characters you strike me as the type of player who would have played them anyway, regardless of this feature. Not attacking you.. that's just the impression I get of people with that many alts. They like to spread the game across all characters. I suspect (and I could be totally wrong) that this feature is aimed more at players who perhaps don't do that now.. but might in the future if they feel there is an advantage to playing alts once they've maxed out their main. Perhaps Blizzard feel it will help the game in general to have more alts running dungeons or maybe they just feel there needs to be more reason to play alts. Or maybe i'm just paranoid and it's none of the above.</div></div><hr />

I would play them, its true, but there's no way I'd be able to maintain what I'm doing in life, valor capping all of them, and trying out some of the new features being implemented. Thus, I'm thrilled :)</div></div><hr />

I don't play SWTOR - check my previous posts, I thought it was garbage and quit within the free month included with the box. I still think this Daily Blink (and the previous ones for the past few weeks) have been real spiteful, sarcastic bullshit. Like I said, they used to be a bit silly, nowadays they're like the annoying guy on MMO-Champ who hates every game except WoW and will attack people who are excited about other titles.<br />
<br />
Don't believe me? Go look at GW2 threads and see how many &quot;Lol GW2 will suck herp derp&quot; posts there are when no-one's even mentioning WoW till that point. It's always the same shit, where WoW players troll other threads and act as if everyone thinks every game is a WoW killer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There have been people claiming every single new MMO is going to be the WoW killer. In addition, aside from actually claiming that new game X is going to kill wow, perhaps less (directly) zealous hype fans proclaim new game X to be amazingly good, flawless, and &quot;different&quot;.<br />
<br />
You should expect a few jaded cynics after so many failed hype cycles. The hype kills game launches.</div></div><hr />

Those complainers that have the sight under 2 inches are starting to get old. Usually they complain not only things as the valor point buff (which cuts nearly 1/3 of work for each alt, AFTER you worked your ass as everyone else with a main), but also about things as relic slot or prime glyphs being taken for WHOLE TWO WEEKS, making them useless until MoP hit. <br />

If you are talking about valor points atm there is only 1k cap weekly but overall there is no hard cap for VP for example I have more than 16k valor points atm.</div></div><hr />

Of course they aren't. There's nothing &quot;smart&quot; about having to run 15 heroics vs. 10 heroics. The only thing you are doing in the end is running heroics.</div></div><hr />

You will find that there are 4 factions that you will have to rep grind to revered before you can buy VP gear and range from 1250 to 2250 VP's.. (This is from the current beta build.)<br />

More like people might actually run less heroics now since they'll cap sooner therefore you will have less of a chance to play with them. But we'll let you live in your negative little box and maybe one day you'll learn to think outside of it.</div></div><hr />

You obviously don't play more than one toon by the sounds of your rant. Running dungeon after dungeon on your alts is what burnt a lot of folks out it became very tedious.

You maybe AFK during the encounter but the new bosses don't play so nice and that AFker will be dead as a doornail since there is a lot more movement required now in that Feng the Accursed is very much a constant movement fight if you don't move you die.</div></div><hr />

Oh dear i love the people who think mop has anything to do with the wow bleeding my guess is you think mop caused it nope it was 8 months of no new content that did it and on top of that cata is hands down the worst expansion ever made period!Mop will stop the bleeding for sure but not sure about the mataining subs part or even increaseing we will see in a few months if wow is reallt dying or cata caused it.but it will stop bleeding for sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes ?<br />
<br />
You do exactly the same in DS whether you are arcane mage, blood DK tank or holy priest ? <br />
<br />
It's a totally different game considering what role you are playing ! why should you get free shizz on other characters because you can 111111112 on your mage ? you'll end up with an overgeared Tank alt who doesn't even know when he should use his CDs perfectly.<br />
<br />
Go tank, and press the same buttons as a DPS. I think you might fail. this is what i am saying; the learning curve is beingflattened out, and i think it's a really easy way to just cater to people who are actually bored of playing, but want to max everything every week. (which is a contradiction)<br />
<br />
Look dude, i am not a blizz hater or anything, i play everyweek, love the game, i am just pointing out that the direction they are taking is &quot;easyness&quot;, and your ego can't accept that because you think you are OP because you have 12 alts. All i am saying is amount of alts does not equal skill, and therefore should not equal reward uniformly across your alts. Some are good alts, some are crap aren't they ?</div></div><hr />

stop saying free VPs! its not free, its just a little bit more for your alts per run, after you capped on your main. to actually get these &quot;free&quot; VPs you will be running heroics on your alts as usual. knowing 'their class' has nothing to do with gear or knowing an encounter. and I'd rather prefer geared dumbfucks who don't know their class, than pvp-blue-geared idiots who is just waste of a group spot in every aspect of it.</div></div><hr />

Actually, there is buyable valor gear, quite a bit of it in fact, but it's tied to reputation grinds and costs a lot of VP.<br />

A full set of the vendor valor gear in MoP will require you to be revered with the Shado-Pan, the Klaxxi, the Golden Lotus, and the August Celestials, and costs 19825 valor total.<br />

The weekly cap is still set to 1000, meaning it would take 20 weeks to buy a full set of VP gear for a single character.<br />
<br />
So, yeah. They're definitely not &quot;giving away VP gear.&quot; They're not really meant to be a way to gear up at all, really. It's moreso a way to fill in missing slots if you're unlucky with drops, which is what token gear was originally designed for (back before tokens were converted to points).</div></div><hr />

Am in beta and have yet to see the gear upgrade bit, (probably missing something) all I have seen so far are your standard VP gear items spread over 4 factions..</div></div><hr />

It's moreso a way to fill in missing slots if you're unlucky with drops, which is what token gear was originally designed for (back before tokens were converted to points).So am I missing something, or are they pretty much saying to gear up you have to Hc over and over, then LFR over and over, and so on. i.e. grind for gear just to be able to get to the next step of content? I thought the point of the '@90 game' in MoP was to have multiple ways of getting rewards?<br />
All the unrestricted dailies suddenly don't seem so good, if you won't have the valor points to buy anything when you get the rep?<br />
<br />
EDIT: I don't mean play more to get better to beat the content, but grind old content over and over (i.e. Hcs for the 100th time) just to be able to get the gear to get into higher level (challenging) stuff.</div></div><hr />

really sad that swtor is failing, i just started playing it after 7+ years of wow and I (personally) find it way more fun. why don't more people play it?<br />

It's an easy WoW clone with lightsabers... what's &quot;way more fun&quot; about it exactly? Maybe you like the setting more, more power to you, but the core gameplay is exactly the same.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well you have just started playing it. So you won't get it. I played SWTOR til end game lvl 50. Thats when I laughed and cancelled my sub for good. But Prior to its release i played beta and knew the game was gonna fail. But i played it cause Cata had become Boring and D3 wasnt out for another several months and Guild Wars 2 was no where to be seen (release wise). <br />
<br />
Now I am one happy dude. played all GW2 betas love the game's potential. It's seemingly amazing thus far. And WoW!... MoP is looking like the best expansion Blizzard has ever made (love the new battlegrounds). Did i also tell ya how much I love the Ret Paladin changes? :D kk... cause thats my main. :) PvP is my thing. So whatever to PvE couldnt care less.</div></div><hr />

it is free, you wrote it yourself.... &quot;just a little bit more&quot;. Yes, indeed, 50% more, which is 50% free compared to now.<br />
<br />
<br />
and I'd rather prefer geared dumbfucks who don't know their class, than pvp-blue-geared idiots who is just waste of a group spot in every aspect of it.<br />
<br />
Well that's where i beg to differ, i've seen many many people in blues producing better results than LFR geared idiots with no reforges or interest in their main secondary stats. because you can help teach someone in blues when to time their abilities to negate pretty much all damage very effectively, whereas someone decked out in welfare epics has this sense of 'i know what i'm doing, i been rewarded already, bro&quot;. This is why LFR is so retarded dontchaknow. It takes time to play this game perfectly, and this is just giving people the impression they are all OP (btw, i am not saying i am).<br />
<br />
Furthermore, someone in blues will have to grind that dungeon / LFR much more to get their items, which would make end game last longer, and not have 1.1mil ppl dropping becausqe there is nothing to do anymore. This is how you make an expansion last, not by giving out all the gear after 2 weeks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, it won't be Varian and Jaina leading an Alliance charge into Orgrimmar to unseat Garrosh - it will be the horde, with probably Thrall, forcing him to retreat under the city with a few of his loyal lieutenants and then Thrall invites the Alliance to come help them finish him off. LOL. I wonder if Jaina will even be there. And Varian will sit another expac out in his throne room in Stormwind Keep.</div></div><hr />
