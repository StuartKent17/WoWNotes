Warlocks - Lifetap changes incoming<br />
Warlocks might get a nice surprise in the next PTR Build, Lifetap is being changed again !<br />
Some changes are going to be made to lifetap in an upcoming PTR build. Until that time I think we've got enough feedback.<br />
<br />
Please hold your comments on this ability until the new version can be tested, then a new thread can be opened for feedback.<br />
<br />
<br />
US Realms - Free character migration<br />
We will be offering free character moves from selected high population realms to lower populated realms, assisting in population dispersal. The ability to move a character on the selected source realms will become available on Tuesday, February 26 at 12:00PM PST, and are scheduled to run until Tuesday, March 4 at 12:00PM PST.<br />
<br />
In the event that a realm meets our transfer goals before the scheduled end date, the transfers to that realm will be disabled. We highly recommend that if you are planning to transfer that you do so at your earliest convenience. No characters will be eligible for these free moves once the transfers have been closed.<br />
<br />
Once the transfers open you can begin your transfer by visiting the Character Move page located here: https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/account/character-move.html (https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/account/character-move.html)<br />
<br />
The realms chosen consist of source realms with the highest sustained queues, and destination realms with the lowest population. The numbers gathered are directly from our data, and depict the realms in most need of these transfers. We will be continuing to monitor all realms and open additional free transfers in the future where necessary.<br />
<br />
Source A (PvP) - Illidan, Mal'Ganis, Sargeras, Stormreaver, Tichondrius<br />
Destination A (PvP) - Vashj<br />
<br />
Source B (PvP) - Arthas, Burning Blade, Mannoroth, Mug'thol, Warsong<br />
Destination B (PvP) - Zuluhed, <br />
<br />
Source C (PvE) - Area 52, Arygos, Ghostlands, Hellscream, Zul'jin<br />
Destination C (PvE) - Velen<br />

Stage6 going down February on 28th<br />
On February 25, 2008 it was announced that Stage6 will be shutting down service on February 28, 2008, if there is any video here you want to save, today is probably your last chance to do it. <br />
<br />
[i]&quot;As Stage6 grew quickly and dramatically (accompanied by an explosion of other sites delivering high quality video), it became clear that operating the service as a part of the larger DivX business no longer made sense. We couldn’t continue to run Stage6 and focus on our broader strategy to make it possible for anyone to enjoy high quality video on any device. So, in July of last year we announced that we were kicking off an effort to explore strategic alternatives for Stage6, which is a fancy way of saying we decided we would either have to sell it, spin it out into a private company or shut it down.<br />
<br />
I won’t (and can’t, really) go into too much detail on those first two options other than to say that we tried really hard to find a way to keep Stage6 alive, either as its own private entity or by selling it to another company. Ultimately neither of those two scenarios was possible, and we made the hard decision to turn the lights off and cease operation of the service.<br />
<br />
So that’s where we are today. After February 28, Stage6 will cease to exist as an online destination. But the larger DivX universe will continue to thrive.&quot;<br />

the lifetap post sounds &quot;locks cried too much and its so embarrassing that we are going to do other changes&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Infinite mana is just too stressful. Did you see that gigantic thread about &quot;Well thanks Blizzard, if Warlocks run out of health and mana we're basically dead now&quot;. It was the most hilarious thing I've read since early BC.<br />
<br />
Of course, it's not all unreasonable, the fact that it was scaling worse and worse with better gear is just awkward, and Warlock is a class that had it's population dramatically spiked by rerolls and kiddies during the final days of base WoW and early BC. A lot of the utterly fantastic old school locks I play with largely get drowned out by the Hunter 2.0 vocal majority the class has been concentrating.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lol - agree. I do know a few &quot;old school&quot; locks - actually the best locks players. As the class went from a about 6% to 11% of the population (more or less), they were drowned by the rerrolers. Sometimes I think Locks have become Huntards 2.0 (ok, maybe not as bad ;)), but things will tend to get better.<br />
<br />
Something getting worse as the gear improves is indeed a bit awkward, but far from unseen - warriors tanks suffer the most from this when they outgear the instance. Mage combustion (the 31 point talent) also gets worse as crit rating improves.<br />
<br />
Anyway PTRs are exactly for that - to test and fix before they go live.</div></div><hr />

warriors can always turn around or sit down tho.<br />
but i don't think that outgearing an instance should be seen as a problem, nor should critting too much ;)<br />
<br />
the fact that it didn't scale as well with gear was irrelevant to the fact that it was somewhat op to begin with, hence the changes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well, as you probably know the problem for warriors is that their avoidance stats make them not get hit, hence they become rage deprived and can't generate aggro. Which makes life difficult on trigger happy DPSers (ah? me??? naah, not me!!! ;)). That doesn't happen to other tanks (druids and palas), due to different mechanisms.<br />
<br />
Mage increased crit makes the talent less useful, thats all (personally I'd like to see it replaced by a &quot;increase the spell crit change of you next 10 fire spell casts by 30%), but nothing gamebreaking (like the LT change isn't).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Note that it actually does happen to Paladins! It's just not as noticeable to the DPS because a Paladin's &quot;Blue Rage bar&quot; starts full and goes empty (FAST if he's not getting hit). A Paladin has to take damage in order to get mana back from heals, so he'll run dry very very fast if he outgears the content. If it's a longish fight the DPS could easily pass his initial threat.<br />
<br />
But the main effect is having to drink after every single pull :(<br />
<br />
On my Paladin, I'm in all blues and already experiencing this problem in Normal-mode instances.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Heh, no, this was in reference to tanking! I'm not casting FoL while tanking, can't block parry or dodge while channeling a spell ;)<br />
<br />
I guess I should have specified &quot;Protection Paladin.&quot; It was in reference to Warriors having threat problems as their gear gets better. Prot Paladins have the same problem, it's just not quite as noticeable to DPS because with a starting-full mana bar a Prot Paladin can frontload a lot of threat. But it's not always enough…if I never get hit at all (or only for very little) I can actually run completely dry and basically stop threat generation. If the DPS catches up to my initial (large) lead then we're boned.<br />
<br />
But because the initial lead is usually large, at my level of content it basically just means I have to drink after every single pull, which slows down the whole run and is rather annoying. But I always feel like it would be presumptuous of me to put extra burden on the healer by swapping out to solo'ing Int/MP5/SD gear.</div></div><hr />

But because the initial lead is usually large, at my level of content it basically just means I have to drink after every single pull, which slows down the whole run and is rather annoying. But I always feel like it would be presumptuous of me to put extra burden on the healer by swapping out to solo'ing Int/MP5/SD gear.<br />

Im sorry. I thought you were healing :\. After re reading your post it makes a whole lot more sense. ahaha. I would try swapping a few pieces out but still maintain the 492 def, that way you can still be uncrushable (right?) but still take damage while dishing out more holy damage for threat. I'm a healer, and more damage = shorter fights = less mana spent by me :D, especially at the spellcrit rate im getting. <br />

Now, in upcoming 2.4 patch, PvE-geeks get free epics from Kael'thas (5 + 8 (heroic) epics).<br />
WoW should change name to World Of Epicraft, since you get epics without any problems in no time. ???</div></div><hr />

Tank without pants =P<br />
<br />
or you can force some dmg on urself :P I have a white 2h wep with no stats on an action bar next to my sword and board. I just spam the sword then the tanking pair to take a sudden spike of stamina loss and maybe some dmg taken :P then you just have to wait for the heal xD Or you can use more mana pots, one from pvp are easy to get as they only cost marks and can be used everywhere, though arent quite as powerful.<br />
<br />
Another alternative to my above strategy it also to turn around so you take some back arc dmg.<br />
<br />
As for drinking after each pull, get used to it =P</div></div><hr />

One example is the Fel-tinged mantle from Vexallus and I think there is an additional epic from the first boss as well.</div></div><hr />
