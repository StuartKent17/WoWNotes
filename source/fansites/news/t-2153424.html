He's going to be this expansion's Kael'thas (just to mimic TBC which many claim was the best expansion). He'll likely be back on Argus either as yet another raid boss or he gets demoted to a dungeon and/or world quest boss.<br />
<br />
Funny how long it took Blizzard to nerf the cost of the tomes. They couldn't do it with the 7.1.5 or in a hotfix before that patch with everyone complaining? They had to wait until the day Nighthold opened? Really like to know why Blizzard insists on having the cost of things start out insanely high and then nerf it later. They've been working on the game long enough to have a good idea of what things should cost and what players are willing to do. It's like with the stupidly rare curious coins. Getting 1 in like 4 months shows the drop rate is too damn low. This should have been obvious in beta. Now they've increased the drop rate substantially.<br />
<br />
It's pretty sad when we have to constantly argue with Blizzard on things to get them to notice there is a problem. I think they purposefully set things too high to nerf them later just to say they're listening. They're not listening. If they were listening, they wouldn't repeat the same mistake over and over. I've said it on the official forums, but Blizzard's full of trolls. Murozond said the definition of insanity is repeating the same action hoping for different results. Blizzard is repeatedly repeating the same mistake over and over and over again. That'd not listening. That's trolling your customers and hoping if they repeat the same irritating &quot;mistake&quot; enough times the customers will give up arguing with you.</div></div><hr />

I know it's a portal through the Twisting Nether, and that we're eventually going to Argus, but is there anything that shows the portal opening up before, or during, the fight that would provide players who don't keep up with &quot;what's ahead&quot; to understand what's going on?</div></div><hr />

I disagree. I thought it was really good. Badass, showing Gul'Dans final failure (which is what he's feared the most) and then Gul'Dan dieing the same way Varian did.<br />

I will say it could've used more player character or even NPCs in there but eh. I liked it.</div></div><hr />

Why? It's their group at the end of the day so it's their requirements. If you don't like it look for a different group or make your own. Plenty of options to avoid these groups and not using them is on you. God forbid people want a group with high ilvls just to rush through it for their essences.<br />
<br />
I don't like it either but at the end of the day who am I to question someones group requirements? I can just go and make my own or join one with lower requirements.</div></div><hr />

So? It's still their own group at the end of the day. I haven't told you anything either. I said there are options to dealing with those stupidly high ilvl groups. I said at the end of the day the leader can set the requirements. I never agreed with them.</div></div><hr />

Lmao this deserved a gold trophy, not an infraction.<br />
<br />
He was spot on, too.<br />
<br />
On the Cinematic, at FIRST I thought Gul'dan was gonna go big mode, but THEN they were Illidan's wings, it was a cool trick. Had me at the edge of my seat.<br />
<br />
I should have realized when Illidan's theme started playing, but yeah, that was really well played.<br />
<br />
Also ahahaha Gul'dan looked so sad, so cute, lmao.<br />
<br />
Wow, guess Illidan was salty about that whole &quot;Gul'dan trapping his soul in Helheim&quot; thingI'd say given Gul'dan's exquisite history the grudge Illidan has with him is a bit more far-reaching than just that, lmao.<br />
<br />
But I'm certain that would have something to do with it.<br />
<br />
<br />
What a shitty cinematic. <br />
<br />
Very underwhelming, compared to Wrathgate, LK, WC3 Cinematics. Hell, even SC2 Videos were better.Spoken like a shitty person, who is also very underwhelming, and whose only talent is complaining, of which even that he's not very good at.<br />
<br />
I got an idea, how about you go make your own cinematics instead of wasting your time posting on comments sections imbibed with people who don't care about your opinion, and if we ever start to miss you we'll just get a cuckoo bird that plays every hour saying &quot;I've never satisfied a woman! I've never satisfied a woman! I've never satisfied a woman!&quot;</div></div><hr />
