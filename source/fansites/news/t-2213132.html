Addon - Legion Invasion Timer<br />
The Legion Invasion Timer addon (https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/legioninvasiontimer) is helpful for keeping track of upcoming invasions if you are still working on Defender of the Broken Isles (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/11544-defender-of-the-broken-isles). <br />

Legionfall United Proc Rate<br />
We've double and triple checked, but I just wanted to confirm that no changes have been made to Legionfall United (http://www.wowdb.com/orderhall/talents/485-legionfall-united) - and the ability is still functioning as it should.<br />
<br />
Seems like it was just a spot of bad luck that a few folks shared! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1060281-double-ap-proc-communication-please/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20754507391?page=2#38))<br />
<br />
Upcoming Mythic Keystone Changes<br />
To clarify: with these changes, the chest at the end of each Mythic+ run would contain a total of 3 items (2 if you don't beat the timer). That's split across the group, not per-person. <br />
<br />
So yes, it's fewer total items than a 3-chest finish in 7.2. However, it's an increase in items for players doing 1-chest clears at an appropriate difficulty level. This is also why I mentioned that the difficulty cap for M+ will be increasing to 15 once Tomb opens on Mythic.

Upcoming Crypt Fever Change<br />
Crypt Fever is changing to have a high chance on each healing event to deal more damage than it does currently on live. This change is to smooth out the Honor Talent's power based on the type of healer you are facing, while still keeping an emphasis that this is powerful against heal over time effects. We'll be tuning the proc rate and internal cooldown to make sure we're hitting the numbers we want against each type of healer.<br />
<br />
Fix Necrotic Strike! <br />
Changes to Necrotic Strike are coming in 7.2.5 too! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1060277-upcoming-crypt-fever-change/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20754487652?page=2#27))<br />

Bewmaster Tier 20 Set Bonuses<br />
FYI, the datamined Brewmaster T20 bonuses are an old draft. New draft is this:<br />
<br />
2T20: Drinking a Brew triggers Gift of the Ox.<br />
4T20: Gift of the Ox orbs also purify 10% of your staggered damage.<br />
<br />
For clarification, numbers in that set bonus idea are not final (thus calling it a draft). We're thinking now that 10% is likely too high, but that the concept sounds good.

<br />
Fists of Fury<br />
The increased range is becoming baseline for PvE, so that's why.<br />
Correct, Fists of Fury is gaining a range increase baseline, so this part of the Honor Talent has been removed.

FEEDBACK: Tomb of Sargeras Raid Trinkets<br />
Please post any feedback you may have regarding the trinkets that will drop in Tomb of Sargeras (http://www.wowdb.com/items/armor/trinkets?filter-patch=23436&amp;filter-ilvl-min=890) in this thread. The trinkets will be for sale in Dalaran from Tombataur as soon as a hotfix is applied.<br />
<br />
All of the Nighthold trinkets are also for sale to allow for better side by side comparison. The tuning on these trinkets at time of posting is in the right general area, but outliers may exist and are subject to future tuning.<br />
<br />
We have no plans to change any existing trinkets from the Nighthold at this time. Changing trinkets that players have collected over the course of the last few months is our last course of action, as having things that used to be cool that you are relying on to kill bosses become not cool so you can collect new things is rude at best.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
Any plans to fix this whole tank situation (i.e. guardian druids) in arenas?<br />
We're looking into tank balance in PvP, and plan to make some adjustments to at least Guardian in the near future. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/859954940906688512)) <br />

Well, for some people this won't really matter. I've ran quite a few Mythic+ and haven't received any gear on multiple runs (even after averaging). Mainly just do them for the gear at the end of the week and that is all. At least I know I'll get something then (99% of the time a relic that is a downgrade).</div></div><hr />

Doubt it. M+ has kept dungeons more relevant than ever. It's an easier way to provide more 5man content without having to push out a ton of dungeons through the expansion.<br />
<br />
I'm perfectly fine with this change. Keeps stress away from having to avoid depleting it and stops people from feeling so pressured to 3 chest it. The changes don't make them any less relevant than they were before. Just people overreacting.</div></div><hr />

Its not overreacting, there's a decent change in the depletion mechanic and an absolutely horrid change in the loot reduction. It was already a rather low chance of getting what you need, now its even worse for no reason.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a reason. It's to stop people from farming lower level keys just to 3 chest for more loot. With the max keystone being raised from 10 to 15 again it means that people can aim to do 15 even if it means not doing what would normally be considered a 3 chest timer. People weren't doing mythic+s that they didn't feel they could 3 chest because of it.<br />
<br />
So yes. Overreacting.</div></div><hr />

Remove the chest nerf. Farming lower keys isn't a problem so stop trying to make it one.<br />

Except if you can 3 chest a 15 (which isn't hard if you have half a brain) its a reduction and makes M+ not worth doing, IE dead.<br />
<br />
I don't get how people can be like &quot;Yay they're taking loot away!&quot;<br />
<br />
They can shove the same six pieces in that one chest, but they want to kill M+.<br />
<br />
Oh and people were doing low keys was only a thing BECAUSE keystones were limited in a group, with the depletion change you can run endless 10/15s within one group now.</div></div><hr />

Except the average user can't 3 chest on a 15 much less so on harder affix weeks. I guess the majority of WoW users don't have half a brain. Who knew.<br />

No people were doing quick keystones because they were faster, easier, and had so much loot that running those multiple times were more effective than taking much more time running a 10-15 and potentially getting less than 3 chests.<br />

I got raiding, I don't care, but they're seriously trying to kill it say this point. Three items is too little, that's LESS then you get from most dungeons on regular mythic. I think only maw has 3 bosses. I just don't understand how you can look at less loot overall and be like &quot;hmm, Good change&quot;.<br />

<br />
If you one chested any Mythic+ currently then you would only get 2 pieces of loot. What is your point exactly?<br />
<br />
You can look at the changes and say &quot;good change&quot; because of the problems it fixes. You don't have to farm lower levels to get max loot. You don't have to find overgeared pugs for the higher keys just to make sure you 3 chest it. You don't have to worry about people leaving to depleting your stone or even depleting it in general.<br />
<br />
Reg Mythic is also irrelevant considering it's a lower ilvl than Mythic+ loot. It's not going to compete with raid loot in most circumstances. Sure, I can agree that maybe 3/4 pieces of loot (3 standard 4 if you do it fast enough) might be a better change but I'm not going to pretend like the changes don't bring a lot of good and that M+ is ruined because that would be ignorant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not saying all the changes are bad, the depletion change should go through. They don't need the loot reduction to kill the farm groups, the depletion does that, people DON'T need new keys from outside groups anymore. People aren't farming less then 10 for gear either, that's AP farming (people still do that which is quite sad with the changes) the groups that farm a 5 right now can farm a 10 JUST as quick, but overall there's MORE 5 keys then 10 keys, 10 keys are limited. They need to make them worth running though, every dungeon has SO much loot that can drop, only giving you a chance a 3 of those is just silly, 5 at MINIMUM for clearing fast enough.<br />
<br />
If they want to buff slightly for people who can't even 2 chest (which btw would still be a loot nerf in 7.2.5, the only time you win is if you can BARELY make a timer) just give 3 items base, still less then a normal mythic, but more then they do now.<br />
<br />
It may not kill mythic+ but its on the way to doing just that, already we're planning no more than 1 +15 for the week for the chest, no point farming with an even worse drop rate.</div></div><hr />

More like you're just looking for the next thing to cry about like everyone else. But sure, throw insults because you don't have a valid argument to be had. It's definitely the way to have a debate.<br />
<br />
It's definitely overreacting and your response further proves that. Everyone is going to continue running M+ just like they're doing now. Only they'll be pushing for 15 instead of 10 for the weekly chest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's so demoralizing they are reducing loot, it already takes many many runs to even possibly find an upgrade.<br />
<br />
I don't understand what is the problem with it currently? I think it's one of hte best things about the game right now. This change is going to piss off a lot of people. Even visually, &quot;3-chesting&quot; runs is nice to have, makes you feel good. Not only are they reducing loot, but making it more inefficient.</div></div><hr />

Something doesn't seem right with this at all. <br />
<br />
It would not be the first order hall fail, the order halls need to be fixed to some degree as some classes most definitely have it easier than others. Similar issues with my Monk and ever getting armor upgrades at all unless it's from a mission that awards them. Also I hate that my new 7.2 follower on my dk is blood. I don't need a 3rd blood follower. &gt;.&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
It will be done the same was Nighthold was. A patch prior to raid release and then more tuning after the first week it's out and they have more data.</div></div><hr />

I seem to see a post you insulting half the wow player base ...<br />
.<br />
&quot;Except the average user can't 3 chest on a 15 much less so on harder affix weeks. I guess the majority of WoW users don't have half a brain. Who knew.&quot;<br />
<br />
And before you attempt to defend that comment it's an insult however you try to sugar coat it. <br />
<br />
Hypocrisy?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm honestly glad you decided to make a new account to make 0 sense.<br />
<br />
The average user can't 3 chest a 15. Especially now that 15 is harder than it used to be. More difficult affixes only aim to reduce that number.<br />
<br />
That's not insulting. That's fact. It's no different than the average user not being able to successfully do Mythic raiding much less clear 10/10 Mythic NH. Neither of them were designed for the average user. It just makes them average, and there is nothing wrong with that. I'm not the one saying that the average user has half a brain, It's sarcasm aimed at the guy that DID imply it as most of the WoW player base CAN'T complete a 3 chest +15.<br />
<br />
So by all means, understand the situation before making a new account just to look clueless. I don't have to defend shit and you can look at it any way that you want to regardless of how wrong you are.</div></div><hr />
