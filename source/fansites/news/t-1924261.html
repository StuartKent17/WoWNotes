Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Why do you feel games need to be hard?<br />
I don't think games need to be hard. They need to be satisfying and one way to do that is overcoming a true challenge (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/677879608729993220))<br />

Pretty sure Doom 3 was received rather well and you kill *babies* -- not kids.<br />
<br />
But seriously, if you can't separate game fantasy from reality I'd suggest seeking some help. WoW has you kill all kinds of thing and people and yet no one even *questions* it -- and for good reason. It's. A. Fantasy.</div></div><hr />

You can. Just not in a game rated T. Any game that depicts this automatically gets a &quot;M&quot; rating, which severely limits their audience, so most game developers take the path of greater customer base.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you? You play a game where you murder people. Now most of us see that as no big deal cause it's just a game. So adult murder in a fantasy is the same as child murder. It's all fake. But you seem to think differently. So are you mentally ill? You enjoy murdering people?</div></div><hr />

I don't understand why they are not using the bulwark of azzinoth aesthetic more. Like the tower shiedlish thing that a lot of people seem to like. Like the last variation here with the little twist. They should use that more and focus the look of the shield around that and make it bigger, more towery. At least for me that is the feel I want to get from a protection warrior legendary. The sword is okay but not too special; I like the clean look.<br />
What I absolutely don't like is that whole vrykul theme around warriors in legion. Vrykul and Dragons have nothing to do with a warrior theme for me. They are nothing more than humans which any proud horde character would not want to be associated with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If anything, Vrykul would fit the Fury warrior (the term &quot;berserker&quot; is a Norse one, afaik). But for me, Warrior prototypes come from the basic units of WCIII - fury are the Orc grunts, prot are the Human foot soldiers, and arms would possibly be NE sentinels. I wonder why they won't use these basic concepts. Vrykul are not that iconic to me.</div></div><hr />
