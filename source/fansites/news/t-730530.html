World of Warcraft &quot;Tap Chat&quot; Pedal by Creative<br />
Earlier today, an announcement was posted on the official site about a new &quot;Tap Chat&quot; pedal, it was removed a few minutes later but it looks like Creative plans to release it very soon. The announcement is gone from all Blizzard website but the Tap Chat seems to be available on Creative UK Website (http://uk.store.creative.com/products/product.aspx?catid=1&amp;pid=19725)<br />
You can now add even more functionality to the award-winning Sound Blaster World of Warcraft Headset with the new Tap Chat foot pedal accessory. By mapping your push-to-talk key or favorite macro to this foot control pedal, you can keep your hands totally free to control the game. As a bonus, the Tap Chat pedal will also come with an exclusive set of World of Warcraft logo lenses to further customize the look of your headset.<br />

Cataclysm Beta - European Guild Contest (28th of June to 23rd of July, 2010)<br />
Guildmasters, it’s time to earn you and your guildmates a gaze into the Cataclysm! Gather your friends, head over to your favourite spot and showcase your impressive photography skills. Every week, for five weeks, the 100 most impressive screenshots will earn you and your guild 10 keycodes to access the World of Warcraft: Cataclysm (http://www.wow-europe.com/cataclysm/) Beta!<br />
<br />
What are you waiting for? All you need to do is take a screenshot of you and your guild showing off your creativity in terms of breath-taking landscapes, lighting, impressive camera angles and epic poses. The only requirement is that the word “Cataclysm!” is displayed in a chat bubble together with your character and guild names! Please remember that submissions missing the chat bubble and guild name tags will be ineligible to win.<br />
<br />
The Guildmaster will then proceed to send us the screenshot and their selection of 10 Battle.net account e-mail addresses using the dedicated webform (http://www.wow-europe.com/contests/fanartcontest.html?locale=en_GB).<br />
<br />
Here is some advice to help you with your submissions:<br />
<br />
Use the environment to your advantage! Points of interest, dungeons, even bosses are there to help you.<br />
Pimp your screenshot by setting the in-game graphics settings to the max! There is no need to worry about your frame rate since the submission is a still image.<br />
We strongly encourage you to disable your addons while taking the screenshot. Keep the default interface on and capture your picture of awesomeness!<br />
Don't forget to read the contest rules (http://www.wow-europe.com/en/legal/contests/guildcontest-10.html). <br />
<br />

Cloth Itemization in Cataclysm<br />
Yes. If it has +hit on it, it might be attractive to a mage, lock or Shadow priest. If it has +Spirit on it, it will be more attractive to healing priests. If it has neither stat on it, then it might be attractive to any cloth wearer. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626573044/strength-1-handed-weapons-in-4-0/))<br />
<br />
Spirit in Cataclysm<br />
You'll need enough Spirit to have good regen. That probably doesn't mean you're going to pass on every item without Spirit.<br />
<br />
Spirit is a weird stat that is technically primary but has more in common with stats like crit and haste. What I mean is that if you found an item without Intellect, you'd almost certainly pass on it because that likely means the item has Agi or Strength instead. But if you find an item with Int but no Spirit, it might be a good upgrade. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626573044/strength-1-handed-weapons-in-4-0/))</div></div><hr />

Ya don't need the over-priced official headset. Lots of HID foot pedals, which use generic drivers, will work great. I found one from ixbay for 15 bucks: http://www.ixbay.com/en/pc-computer-usb-single-action-foot-switch-pedal-hid.html</div></div><hr />

Good to hear about the EU beta competition at last. Looks like they're trying to get groups of people likely to play together this time, rather than just random people like LK beta was.<br />

That could potentially cut down the amount of time Cata stays in beta stage. Hopefully.</div></div><hr />

I bought a headset from the blizzard store, worked fine for about a week, then the software or something started having problems. Loud, ungodly screeching noise (like a transformer on crack, a guildy described it to me) everytime you try to talk. Customer service's solution to the problem was 'make sure the microphone is plugged in correctly' and to 'keep checking the creative website for updates'. YAY!<br />

<br />
Definately fun to pay for brand names! Same thing with their headset :P Get a fairly comfortable large headset that lets you change the color on the earphones that comes with swappable lenses for $120! Doesn't come with a software disc, as apparantly they couldn't put the World of Warcraft™ logo on a disc to include in the box, so you have to download the software!<br />

what the fuuuuck?! So beta is comming like in august? im starting to doubt cata will be released this year. Very dissapointing after seeing path of the titans scrapped!!!<br />
<br />
Totally agree with you here, seems like beta wont be until mid july now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard is not in a hurry and our disappointment, anger, threats (including suicidal) just make them laugh (if that!). <br />
<br />
Seriously though, I do not think they'll release this year. <br />
<br />
Time-wise, they probably _could_ make it for Xmas, but there will be other (competing) titles filling up the shelves, so why bother? They have enough money to last them till release of Diablo 3, Starcraft 2 will be released this year already, so they can wait till Summer Holidays 2011, as far as dispassionate analysis is concerned. <br />
<br />
I bloody hope I'm wrong here, btw. <br />
<br />
P.S. who cares about the stupid pedal, seriously guys?!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also... why is everyone so upset that it sounds like the beta is out in August?<br />
That's honestly earlier than I expected.<br />
<br />
First of all, there is two glowing eyes. Secondly, are you really going to be entertained with Icecrown Citadel and one extra boss for what is looking like over a year? That's even worse than the Sunwell. Well, I kind of expected it but I would rather see &quot;soon&quot; than have messages that arouse false hope, and there is plenty of them. For example a quote many remember, &quot;You will be complaining about Goblin rogues by next BlizzCon&quot;. The fact that this is looking to be the slowest expansion to hit the market, and much of Blizzard's ambitions being dashed is kind of getting old.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yangli</div><div class="date">2010-06-29, 07:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I too think the pedal is a nice idea. (Doesn't need to be the official one, though...)<br />
Having push to talk near your usual buttons mades it simple to push, but at the risk of pushing it accidently sometimes. Having it far away makes it difficult to push without abandoning the movement keys or the mouse.<br />
I use TS on my laptop, while playing on PC, so it's even another keyboard I have to move my hand to... Voice activation is no option, cause it makes me paranoid (always fear that I might be heard breathing or such.) So I rarely speek while fighting a boss. See why people might like that pedal now? <br />
<br />

Apparently you missed all the people I was arguing with back in APRIL who thought Beta was early May at the LATEST, because Blizz released some incredibly preliminary class info. When you want something really badly, and don't really understand the process by which it is released, you tend to see everything as a sign. <br />
<br />
You see this a lot on author's websites too: the author will announce that they've completed a first draft and suddenly half the website is aflame with people wanting to know if they book will be out next week.

<br />
That's sort of immaterial to the point. It explains why people *want* Beta to be soon, but has no bearing on the fact that they're making completely unrealistic predictions based on their desires. No amount of desire on the part of the user base can change the reality of development time lines, just as no amount of desire on the part of fans can change the reality of publishing time lines. Predictions should be based on facts, not on desires. Basing predictions on desires is simply a particularly unproductive form of gambling that sets people up for disappointment. <br />
<br />
At this point I think it *is* reasonable to expect beta in the next few weeks. The information now very much points to a mid-July to very early August Beta, but that's based on contest data, an understanding that the class talent trees and bonuses are starting to be more than skeletons, and a bit of guess work based on the release schedule WOTLK used. These are facts, not hopes. I could still be wrong (it's still just my prediction), but at least I can support my thesis with more than &quot;IWANTITNAO!&quot;</div></div><hr />

Well ... no. I guess you could if you were alone in your room (or mom's basement) but if people play anywhere near others like a talking spouse or arguing teenagers or screaming kids, then no. :)<br />
<br />
I don't see why people think a pedal is an insane idea. It may not fit everyone's play style, but styles aren't right and wrong, they're different. Just because someone prefers voice activated or has a free finger to PTT doesn't make the whole concept of a foot pedal stupid.<br />

Been using a foot pedal for about a year. Any ol' USB foot pedal should work, as long as you can set what the pedal is sending. I have it set to a specific key, which push to talk is also set to.<br />

<br />
The country restriction is applied to all of the people in the said guild, or is it only for the guild master, that needs to be in those &quot;select&quot; countries?<br />
The way i understand it is....<br />
Even if most of the guild members are from countries not listed, they can still get the key, because the guild master is eligible and he is the one entering in the contest.<br />
Or did i misunderstand it?<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading :)</div></div><hr />

I built it using a USB to Joystick adapter and a standard 15 pin joystick schematic. The whole thing cost me about $30 and runs using the Windows standard game controller drivers, with only one button mapped to actually do anything (Ventrilo PTT key). Although it could make for interesting gameplay to map it as a modifier key instead.<br />
<br />
I was also thinking about building a DDR-style dancepad controller and mapping tanking macros to it for my warrior towards the end of TBC. I never actually went forward with that, although it could have made for some funny videos...</div></div><hr />
