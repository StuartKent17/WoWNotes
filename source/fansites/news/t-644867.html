Blue posts<br />
Not a lot of blue posts during the week-end ... but always better than nothing!<br />
Armor Penetration Rating vs. Cloth<br />
Is this one of those take our comments out of context deals? We didn't want armor pen to be exceptionally good vs. cloth. That is unintuitive and doesn't accomplish the role of the stat anyway, which is to let you do good damage against even highly armored targets. At the same time, we didn't want to let you totally ignore the armor of a boss because that does some bad things such as make the Sunder debuff useless and make your damage too high. As a poster said above, it's in a good place - right where it needs to be. It's not the end-all be-all stat that you should stack at the expense of all other stats. It isn't worth gutting your Strength or hit to maximize. This smells like one of those situations where you just saw &quot;didn't want to be too powerful&quot; and interpreted that through a lens of &quot;Blizzard hates warriors.&quot; If you are looking for an answer from the theorycrafters of &quot;Should I ignore ArPen or not?&quot; I don't think you are going to get a simple answer (which is good). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16473618356-116-armor-pen-only-giving-66.html))<br />
<br />
Armor Penetration Rating bugged?<br />
We did test it and QA said it was working correctly. When we saw several posts on it, the designers checked it again and concluded it was still working correctly. I figured in this case it was going to be pretty tricky for the community to test their own numbers because the calculation was not trivial (though in many cases you got pretty close anyway).<br />
<br />
Most of the time when I am asking the community for numbers, it's because they think something is working differently from the way we think it is working. The only way to know for sure is to compare our numbers to their numbers. That doesn't mean we are asking the community to be our QA. We have an excellent and vast QA department. Of course in a game the size and complexity of WoW with the amount of changes we constantly implement, it also doesn't mean they will catch every bug. <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (3.1 Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=650) / 3.1 Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?deathknight))<br />
Death Strike hotfix<br />
As several players above demonstrated, Death Strike ignores the third disease if you are Unholy and have a third disease. It does more healing with two diseases up than with one disease or no diseases up. We lowered the healing done quite a bit. It appears to be working correctly.<br />
<br />
If Frost and Unholy never Death Strike again, then we might consider a different implementation. Perhaps Death Strike heals similarly for all specs, and Blood just does more damage (but not more healing for that damage).<br />
<br />
When there is a contention between quality of life issues and being overpowered, the latter always has to win out. We're not going to let an ability be overpowered for one spec just because nerfing it makes it weak for other specs (especially when the other specs have options to use other abilities or even respec).<br />
<br />
Death knights have been at the top of the food chain for a long time. We're not trying to nerf them into oblivion, but if you're used to being an indestructible juggernaut, life might feel a little different for you in 3.1. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16474258965-the-death-strike-hotfix-is-bugged.html))<br />
<br />
Blood Boil<br />
We made Blood Boil require a target so that it wasn't an attractive button to just hit whenever to generate runic powr. However, we have now come to think that only charging the DK when the ability does damage is inconsistent with other AEs and unfair. We'll try to come up with a solution that doesn't just involve pulling off the runic power generation. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16474149824-is-bloodboil-fair.html))<br />

Power Word: Shield<br />
Power Word: Shield is a really useful tool for Disc priests in particular. We want them using it. However, its utility is balanced by a high cost. If we get to the point where they are spamming it constantly to the exclusion of other spells and without it ever being a decision, that suggests mana regen is still too high.

<br />
Here's the thought process:<br />
<br />
DS hits too hard for Blood. 10k crits aren't what we want on this ability.<br />
So let's nerf it. It'll now do the same damage, but instead only heal a small fraction of what it did before.<br />
Now Blood will still be doing all the damage it did before, but it will receive a smaller portion of healing!<br />
<br />
And here are the side effects:<br />
<br />
Frost and Unholy have removed DS from their bars.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For serious. And if that tentacle can say, put out... 300 dps, hell, even 200 dps, all by itself, that's a pretty damn nice increase if it's every two minutes. Moreover, as its crit, anybody that uses crit (in theory), including healers even, could use it without gimping themselves totally, and be able to add that dps to the fight.</div></div><hr />

It's obviously free loot considering that it took 5 days for one of the best guilds in the world. ::)<br />

Also notice Deus Vox comment on that encounter:<br />
<br />
Deus Vox has successfully downed the hardest mode of the Assembly of Iron defeating Steelbreaker last. The kill took place on 04/20/2009 at 12:05 AM CST. This encounter is the most DPS intensive fight that I've experienced so far with the burn on Steelbreaker, having virtually no margin for error being very reminiscent of M'uru/Entropius. Congratulations to all that participated.</div></div><hr />

I guess they had no option, since US got their hands on 3.1 almost 1 day ahead of them. So their only option was rush it as fast as it was possible.<br />
My guess is they are playing alts right now, testing what to do on next reset, i wont be surprised if they plann something big to compensate.</div></div><hr />

I think someone's doing it wrong. Spec into Improved Death Strike, get the Sigil of Awareness, and Glyph for Death Strike. Watch 10k damage crits unbuffed that heal you for 4-5k.<br />

<br />
The only guild that is close to getting to algalon is Inner Sanctum, but since they already cleared mimiron normal this week they won't be getting him this reset. So they have to down all the hardmodes again as well as mimiron's hard mode next week, whereas ensidia has to do the same thing. The world first algalon kill is all ensidia and most people care about, and it will be a race between ensidia and inner sanctum to get it.</div></div><hr />

Anyone who reads that quote and assumes this nerf is entirely going to balance DK's knows nothing about the class. Also, anyone who thinks the nerf was justified should read why exactly Blizz nerfed it and how stereotypically knee-jerk it was (what Vallos said on page 1 is along the lines of what happened lol).<br />
<br />
That being said, yeah DS needed a fix, as high end gear in PvE (tanking or dps) AND PvP was allowing for immense amounts of self heal. However, nerfing it because an extremely geared Blood DPS DK happened to crit (I think it even involved a fight mechanic, not just a clean hit) for 10k+ and heal for twice that amount doesn't mean the heal needs to be nerfed into oblivion. Blizz specifically stated after the nerf that as it was a now &quot;fundamental&quot; part of Blood DPS rotation it was healing for too much. Melee PVE DPS SELF-heals being &quot;extraordinarily overpowered&quot; and causing knee-jerk nerfs on fluke mechanics isn't a reasonable basis for changing the ability.</div></div><hr />

I was under the impression this was a PvP nerf to something that got out of hand, not a PvE nerf.. The heals were always supposed to be kept in line with the lower damage output of Death Strike. Sure Unholy and Frost are losing an oh shit button. But Death Strike was always situational, and you can always fall back on Death Pact if you really need that heal outside of potions and healthstones.<br />
<br />
I can't say this change affects me as Unholy in the least. Death Strike was always on my bar but I never felt I needed it. Maybe I just ran with good healers all the time. If you're still requiring heals and don't think the healers are going to get any better, switch back to Blood. I'm still pulling 4k heals at least, which is nice. Plus it's no longer an oh shit button and more of a side effect of using your higher DPS attack. I was going to say stay out of the fire, but so far in Ulduar there's a lot of unavoidable fire.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
We hotfixed a change to the amount of healing provided by Death Strike.<br />
<br />
Originally, this ability was something you would use only situationally to heal yourself at a cost of damage. Since then we have redesigned the death knight class sufficiently to where Death Strike was a major rotational ability for Blood. Given how much the attack is hitting for, we think the amount of healing it provided was too much.<br />
<br />
Healing still scales based on diseases and the damage is unchanged. Blood retains its other tools to heal. <br />
<br />
The way I understood it is it had to do with the overhaul of the Blood DPS playstyle, and that some of the outrageous &quot;10-11k crit DS&quot; screenshots with accompanying 20k+ heals seemed to hit a soft spot really quickly (knee-jerk, and an outcry from a large, whiny portion of the playerbase that find anything they can to pick on DKs about and cry oceans of tears), even though in reality there is no amazingly significant advantage to being able to do that in PvE/Raiding. What I was saying is that if it WAS indeed PvP oriented, and intended for PvP balance and not &quot;omg look at the green numbers during that boss fight we have to kill that by a factor of 5&quot;, they should have specified better.</div></div><hr />

I haven't used deathstrike since levelling since it's damage and healing was so ass. I'd imagine that goes for a fair number of people. I think I use it just to top myself off on trash if I'm dpsing otherwise it never gets touched. Why bother using it when obli or ss does more damage (and in the case of ss, has the added bonus of desecrate)?</div></div><hr />

This was the world first hard mode Iron Council, and you don't just kill the stuff you need to unlock Algalon, you need to do a quest line. Which starts from IC hardmode. So anyone that killed ANY of the 4 hard modes for Algy before Iron Council can't do it this week (read, everyone), EVEN if they did all 5 fights on hard mode somehow.</div></div><hr />

So your problem is with the way they specified the change? Oh. I didn't think they even needed to specify it, but blue posts in general are only there to confuse and enrage people.</div></div><hr />

Use Paladins. Bubble the explosion. No-one dies, Steelbreaker doesn't heal. It's really not that hard.</div></div><hr />

Except they hotfixed it before we killed it so Divine Shield doesnt remove Meltdown. Nice try.</div></div><hr />

They hot fixed it so Divine Protection doesn't remove Meltdown. Not Divine Shield.</div></div><hr />

I didn't say anything about removing Meltdown. I specifically said &quot;Bubble the Explosion.&quot;<br />
Even though the debuff persists, the damage is ignored.<br />
<br />
(I killed it before you)<br />
<br />
Yeah, yeah. I know. &quot;It doesn't matter 'cos it was on 10-man.&quot;<br />
<br />
But it's still the same ability, and the mechanics are the same on either difficulty.</div></div><hr />

Actually you didnt, we killed 10 man hard mode on the 17th, you did on the 18th. Now SIT THE FUCK DOWN.</div></div><hr />

I would eat my boxers if Deus Vox, or anybody for that matter, kills hard mode Iron Council this week. Every dps in your raid must pull over 10000 dps each within a time frame of ~75 seconds.</div></div><hr />
