I remember them saying at some point they were only doing the vanilla races, then they said they would eventually get the the BC races. I was okay with that eventual thing. Until I saw the WoD site and they weren't even listed :( <br />
<br />
But...the remodels are so freakin amazing....they pretty much have to do belfs and space goats now. The gnome looks incredible! And I am a total hordie...might have to make a gnome :)</div></div><hr />

That particular face is obviously based on one of the old tauren concepts from Classic.<br />

They've done a splendid job in capturing the essence of the old models, yet boosting them to incredible new standards. That undead male though, sports a rather different look than its original, which is risky. However, they couldn't have done a better job in making a real 'undead' model.</div></div><hr />

*faint*...if they can improve on the female worgen + the movement and cast/melee animations of the worgen, I'mma be happy! Goblins are quite good but their eyes are a bit too dead compared to Pandaren and beyond.<br />

Well, I would assume that what they've showed is just one of several options for faces. Although I agree that some of the old female gnome faces look great and the new model is a bit weird in comparison.<br />

I never play Undead but they look so f*cking cool, I might actually consider playing one. Matter of taste I guess.<br />
<br />
and on the subject at hand : Wow, those new models. They all look awesome. I still don't get how people can be against new models and think it's a waste of time investing resources into them.<br />

It's not a selling point. You can log in and experience the new player models without purchasing the expansion. The Garrison is just an updated Tiller's farm. Right now, it's just a C- expansion that's being sold. There has to be some amazing technology being implemented that's not yet revealed or another class for this to be a success. Unless, success to Blizzard is simply sustaining existing subs and possibly up-ticking their current sub count to about 8 or 8.5 million from the existing 7.6 million.</div></div><hr />

Every new model makes the old ones look like NES compared to Xbox One, lol, they look amazing. <br />
<br />
I CANNOT wait for my orc female revamp, and even then, I may race change depending on the outcomes of other races.<br />

My only complaint is that some of the WoD trailer looks a little too, well, Disney. Even the revamps seem to look this way. There is a seen of an orc riding a wolf, and it looks a little too fluffy and friendly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My ONLY criticism would be that the undead faces don't look mean enough. I could be completely jumping the gun as they only displayed a few examples, however with some of the current models you can select some pretty badass faces with evil eyes etc. Hope this is the case with the new ones!<br />
<br />

I play undead female and I reeeeeally hope they don't drastically change the way my characters look. I already love the way they look minus a few things like the paper thin and jagged skin covering the big lumpy cartoon bones. But the face, that's a deal-breaker for me. There's really only one nice looking, innocent, doll-like face they have that I love, and if they change it too much, I might lose interest in playing my character, because to me, on a game that emphasizes looks, if I don't think my character looks good I simply won't play it.<br />
<br />
I know it's kind of a silly thing to put so much focus on, especially when there are so many new things to be discussing, but it really makes me worry, and I hope they do a great job. The other models look good, and I know they said they weren't going to drastically change the way they look specifically for the reason I addressed above, but to me they look extremely different. They look better, but really different. That's what worries me the most.</div></div><hr />

It looks a bit like an overgrown Goblin... Not sure if it is the pointy ear or maybe just the green color... Maybe I've always seem Orcs as strong and brute and the new faces make them look a bit silly and expressive (more goblinoids)...<br />
<br />
Besides that, I like the new models. And I'm glad to hear they are leaving goblin and worgen for last, because that means we'll have some BE and Draenei updates as well.</div></div><hr />

On the page where they show the map of draenor (the one with zangar sea on the southernmost part), the image moved/scrolled down fairly quickly to show the entire continent. Where it clearly (but briefly) shows auchindaun is connected by some sort of grey'ish highway to a hub called &quot;Shattrath Raid&quot;. How did nobody ask about that on the panel OR the Q&amp;A panel, it drove me nuts! Second raid anyone? :&gt;</div></div><hr />
