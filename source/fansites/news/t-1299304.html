Ion Hazzikostas Interview<br />
As Patch 5.2 comes to an end, developer interviews begin again! Today we are taking a look at an interview with Ion Hazzikostas (Lead Encounter Designer) by Convert to Raid (http://converttoraid.com/home/m/2780615/article/1484569).<br />

<br />
Throne of Thunder<br />
<br />
The team is happy with how Throne of Thunder turned out, as it really delivered on the varied and large environments, fun encounters, great art, and an interesting race for World First. <br />
Lei Shen delivered on how great the final boss of a tier should be and is comparable to Heroic Ragnaros in terms of difficulty and structure.<br />
The difficulty ramp up between bosses was not as smooth as it could have been, especially going from Jin'rokh to Horridon. This is something that can be improved upon in the next raid, and was addressed with hotfixes this time. <br />
Throne of Thunder has a linear progression path, but many players missed the less linear progression that was seen in Ulduar and Icecrown. Giving players the option to work on another boss is helpful and there were areas in Throne of Thunder that could have been designed with this in mind. <br />
Ra-Den didn't work out completely as envisioned. The sense of mystery associated with a boss that no one knows anything about is nice, making the content a bonus prize for defeating Lei Shen. It was hard to balance and test without the regular player testing, which resulted in clever use of game mechanics to defeat Ra-Den. Normally hotfixes would have been used to solve the problem, but limited attempts made it a more complicated situation. <br />
There might have been slightly too much trash on Raid Finder difficulty, because there are no epic rewards that drop from the trash like Normal and Heroic difficulty. Trash is still an important pacing and environmental factor though, as you are progressing towards Lei Shen through his army. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Raiding<br />
<br />
During Sunwell progression, raiding 20 hours over several days to get a world first on M'uru was unprecedented. Blizzard tried attempt limits or time limits to reduce the need to raid constantly, but it has always been an arms race between the top guilds to raid longer hours. <br />
Limited attempts in Icecrown resulted in using alts to practice encounters before doing them on main characters, increasing the amount of time top guilds spent raiding instead of decreasing it. <br />
The devs would like to see more organized raiding, such as the organized PuGs that existed before Raid Finder. <br />
There is a group of players that wants to do group raiding, but they aren't well served by the current difficulty choices. This would include the friends and family type guilds that don't remove players because they aren't performing at their best. In Wrath of the Lich King, 10 player normal difficulty raiding served these players well, but there is now a gap between Raid Finder and Normal difficulty. <br />
When 10 and 25 player had separate lockouts and different loot, they were really different difficulty levels as well. Things were somewhat easier in 10 player difficulty, as it had the lower tier of loot and should be more accessible. <br />
Now that both 10 and 25 player difficulty offer the same loot and have a shared lockout, there is a need to ensure the difficulty is similar for both raid sizes. This eliminated the lower difficulty 10 player raids, which left some players with no content to raid in a more casual organized group. <br />
Removing shared lockouts would just make people feel that it was mandatory to do the raid on both sizes every week to get gear faster. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Raid Finder<br />
<br />
Raid Finder is great for letting players see content and progress their character with a more flexible schedule, but one of the best things MMOs offer is the cooperative social experience that is group raiding. <br />
The success rates on Spine of Deathwing and Madness of Deathwing upon release in Raid Finder were about the same as they are on Lei Shen today. The success rate quickly went up on Madness of Deathwing, going from 25% during the first few weeks to 60 or 70% towards the end of the expansion.<br />
Garalon was initially too difficult in Raid Finder difficulty, but hotfixes solved that problem. <br />
Before the Determination (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/139068-determination) buff was added, if a group failed at an encounter a few times, there wasn't much hope that anything was going to get better. This resulted in some churn in the group and continued failure. The only way to solve this problem was making the encounter easier so that groups failed less. <br />
Determination allows the group to slowly make more progress on a boss, as well as give people who were thinking about leaving a reason to stick around. <br />
This worked as intended, as the number of people leaving after failed attempts is significantly lower now. This also helps to reduce the amount of partially completed raids that people enter after a long queue. <br />
Raid finder is designed to not be attractive to players that are doing most of the raid on Normal or Heroic difficulty, but for players that don't have a fixed raid group to play with. <br />
In the past, relatively few people were able to see Arthas, Illidan, and other end bosses in raids. Raid finder allows millions of people to see the entire story. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Future / Misc<br />
<br />
Patch 5.4 will have a raid that is similar in size to Throne of Thunder.<br />
The team started working on Patch 5.4 as soon as they were done with work on the Patch 5.2 PTR content. <br />
It would have been nice to have more dungeons while leveling in Pandaria, as there wasn't enough variety. This is something that can be improved upon in the future. <br />
Requiring a group for Heroic Scenarios was done to ensure some level of communication between players, making it possible to make the content more difficult and interesting. <br />

RPPM and Item Upgrades<br />
Definitely worth confirmation!<br />
<br />
Yes. For these special trinkets like RoRO or UVLS the proc rate increases with ilvl. <br />
And here it is. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/260818-question-about-rppm-mechanics/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8796572244?page=1#3))<br />
<br />
Paladins in Throne of Thunder<br />
This is what they've told us: Paladins are quite useful but they feel cases like solo tanking Heroic Megaera (which was mentioned on this thread) has more to do with how encounter mechanics work than the way the class is designed. It's something the developers will work on to be more careful in the future.<br />
<br />
Also, with patch 5.3, there'll be some adjustments to certain Paladin abilities, including a nerf to Shield of the Righteous and Glyph of the Battle Healer (which was meant for Retribution Paladins to begin with). (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/259084-10man-so-i-switched/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7339014025?page=6#103))<br />

<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
Character<br />
interesting tweet, what do you mean by this? Like old days where armor/stam values were different based on armor type?<br />
Perhaps. Armor matters much less with so much non-physical damage. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/330758642234167296))<br />
<br />
had 10 85's 5 DS geared in Cata, have 4 90's and 1 ToT geared now. Stopped alt playing completely now. Better? Just curious.<br />
You are comparing the final raid tier to the not-final raid tier.... (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331568466433822721))<br />
It is irrelevant that they are different tiers GC, you have made alt playing not fun in MoP.<br />
The tons of raid-geared alts didn't happen until Dragon Soul. Then players naturally expected to keep the into 5.0. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331882792667467776))<br />
I'm not saying there weren't alts before, but the average player having 4-5 happened in Dragon Soul. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331882905691357185))<br />
<br />
Lots of discussion lately about gear and its place. Why not simplify? Do away with bracer, belt, boots and 1 trinket?<br />
Would that make loot feel more fun? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331928436371243008))<br />
<br />
You say you have the best programmers, any chance they can programme the lucky coins to not give you an item you already have?<br />
Trivially. But should they? There are downsides to getting all the gear you want as fast as you want it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331574003951079425))<br />
<br />
Looking at the evolution of ilvl of gear in MOP in pvp/pve, do you think it should be done differently next expansion?<br />
We're still trying to solve letting PvE have better upgrades in later tiers without making PvP have huge catchup mechanics. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331572558635888640))<br />
In PvE, you can just avoid the harder instances until you have better gear. In PvP, you're going to run into everybody. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331572654937092096))<br />
<br />
Feel like BoAs take fun away, never replacing gear is lame. Love the XP buff but not trivialized content #toolatetochange<br />
I see where you're coming from, but they're more aimed at people who feel like they're done with the gear w/ leveling thing. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331567058569527297))<br />
<br />
Working stiff, almost no time to play now, so I don't; dailies too time consuming/no catchup method for gear. Fix next xpac?<br />
Is the issue that you can't get into dungeons or raids, or that you want to be able to do charms, valor and rep in addition? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332551363647119360))<br />
I ask because a major problem with Cata (we were told) was that raiders had little to do when they weren't raiding. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332551500121382912))<br />
We added other supplemental loot systems for players looking for more to do. But players with less time felt left out. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332551676781285376))<br />
(And before anyone suggests it, alts suffer from the same problem. Alts used to be something you could do if you had free time.) (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332551885368197120))<br />
(But now we hear from folks that they don't have time for their alts. It's tough to solve.) (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332551971007520769))<br />
It's a Catch 22 being able to provide meaningful content for players with a lot and without a lot of time. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332551785086586880))<br />
<br />
UI / Addons<br />
Greg, srsly. What kind of answer is that? Nothing in the game itself uses a questhelper either. Still you added it.<br />
The game has quests though and that info wasn't available. Nothing in the game points you to coordinates. They feel optional to me. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329314194321207296))<br />
<br />
please fix lag on Lei Shen. seems to be tied with stampede<br />
It is, but we can't reproduce it except for players with out of date Recount or Skada. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329389992860323841))<br />
<br />
not fun having half our 25m get d/c on bosses when a hunter decides to stampede. and this is with recount off. please fix<br />
Are you certain none of the 25 players have recount or skada enabled? We haven't been able to reproduce that case. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332544460829384704))<br />
I never used a damage meter and lagged like crazy on Sha of Fear Heroic. Maybe something deeper... DBM? Ace?<br />
It is definitely related to the stabled pets showing up as &quot;unknown&quot; and then flooding the log when the names are realized. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332643399368855552))<br />
We're not giving up, but it's definitely one of those holycrapwhatisthisactualbug? moments. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332643581057699840))<br />
<br />
Official LFGuild forums unusable mess. Like finding a job on craigslist with not categories, just by post date. Discouraging.<br />
We agree with that, and the Guild Finder tool doesn't solve the problem either. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332555212579536898))<br />
WE need a good, robust guild finding system, but you can't just throw good, robust systems together. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332555334898028544))<br />
<br />
You 'could' does not mean you 'should'. Why would you even design abilities for bosses, if they were to be ignored?<br />
An example is a tank swap mechanic relevant to tanks and perhaps healers that doesn't need to be shouted out to the raid. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331887209626075137))<br />
Another is when a boss mod yells out a countdown for a minor boss debuff that adds to the healing requirements but isn't urgent. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331887455450046464))<br />
Bossmods focus your awareness when used/configured well, but they're never judicious about what's on by default.<br />
They are better about not stealing your raid markers as much as they used to. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331935748938948609))<br />
<br />
If you could remove 1 addon and all like it from the game, ie: Recount/skada, DBM which would you remove and why?<br />
I'm not sure I'd want to remove any of those. Mods are generally good for the game and players like them. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331870907993821184))<br />
Maybe a mod that is cheating (which we tend to block anyway) or something so unstable that it causes players a lot of grief. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/331871090131480576))<br />

<br />
I don´t think GC was saying the opposite. I think he was just saying to wait until 5 months after SoO before you compare it to the end of WOTLK or the end of DS. My guess is that 5 months after SoO.. there will be a lot of people with 5 alts in epics.<br />
<br />
If you follow the advice from the blog last week, it is pretty trivial to get caught up with LFR. Get to 90, go to the island and start getting your elder coins (kill a rare and get your key every week is the secret). It is pretty easy to run MSV, HOF and Throne and have a bonus roll on every boss. Also, at the end of the expansion, like WOTLK and Cata is when those ilvl 476ish type craftable epics become dirt cheap.<br />
<br />
I see now reason to doubt that I will start the next expansion with as many ´epiced´ alts as I did with Cata. GC is right though, it isn´t fair to compare ´now´ with the end of an expansion. Most of us are trying to eek out any power gains on our mains. Once you beat Garrosh, most players don´t have as much motivation for small power gains on your mains.. that is when you switch to your alts and get them ready for next expansion.<br />

<br />
I wanted to question GC's statement about geared alts since I really enjoyed having lots of 85s geared back then, but after looking at this comment, it's fair enough I suppose. Dragon Soul lasted really long for a tier which is around 9 months, so it felt like I had all day to gear one alt at a time. However that tier also only had 2 LFR wings, unlike the MoP tiers which have 4 and 5 wings respectively. Take account of 20-40 minute DPS queues and possible boss/trash wipes per wing it's gonna take quite a while to finish a day's worth of gearing. If I ask for less wings though the possibility is that Blizz will either lower the amount of the tier's bosses (which I don't want them to), or just make one wing contain more bosses (preferable imo).<br />
<br />
tl;dr only time will tell if Siege of Orgimmar will even be comparable to Dragon Soul in terms of gearing alts. I'll restrain my QQs for now.</div></div><hr />

Trash is still an important pacing and environmental factor though, as you are progressing towards Lei Shen through his army. *<br />
<br />
Trash in lfr = waste of time<br />
I dont know why they didnt add a ability too drop normal epics. That would at least have some bonus for normal/heroic raiders too go there.</div></div><hr />

Defintly sounds like they are leaning to do something like that.<br />
even tho i hate 10/25 shared lockout but i doubt they will do it<br />
<br />
that will make more than 70% of the raiding community sad,</div></div><hr />

I think he was just saying to wait until 5 months after SoO before you compare it to the end of WOTLK or the end of DS. My guess is that 5 months after SoO.. there will be a lot of people with 5 alts in epics.<br />
<br />
If you follow the advice from the blog last week, it is pretty trivial to get caught up with LFR. Get to 90, go to the island and start getting your elder coins (kill a rare and get your key every week is the secret). It is pretty easy to run MSV, HOF and Throne and have a bonus roll on every boss. Also, at the end of the expansion, like WOTLK and Cata is when those ilvl 476ish type craftable epics become dirt cheap.<br />
<br />
I see now reason to doubt that I will start the next expansion with as many ´epiced´ alts as I did with Cata. GC is right though, it isn´t fair to compare ´now´ with the end of an expansion. Most of us are trying to eek out any power gains on our mains. Once you beat Garrosh, most players don´t have as much motivation for small power gains on your mains.. that is when you switch to your alts and get them ready for next expansion.<br />
<br />
Part of the issue with WOW atm is that Blizzard seems to want to control if and when players play their alts. Considering that Cata was left dead in terms of content for 8 months towards the end and alot of players grew fond of their ALT.... it was simply NOT acceptable to throw things back 1000% the other way at start of the expansion. And thats also exactly the same with the end of MOP. We were told that there are plans to change the empty space between last raid and new expansion. Sounds to me there are no changes planned and ppl are back forced to play alts if they want to continue to play. But Im pretty sure many players will think twice this time around considering the very unfriendly systems for alts in MOP and knowing that Blizzard will be putting up same blocks for those alts to progress in next expansion. <br />
<br />
Personally - I think WOW will see the biggest drop in sub numbers ever in the last 6 months of this expansion. Cause ppl are not going to bother with alts if they are then just punished for bothering to level them when new expansion comes out. Whenever that will happen.</div></div><hr />

I think their argument before would have been that ilevel leaps between tiers were getting crazy as a result of the staggered ilevel between 10s 25s and then heroics of both. If this is still the case I'm not sure they'd want to implement this again. Of course they could narrow how much of an improvement they were from what they had been previously.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
I think LFR is over all a good thing, the problem is its taking from another niche that needs to be filled, but doing so in a way that doesn't fully satisfy the niche. LFR is great for people who don't want to be too serious, just go play, que up and see some raids, maby with some friends in chat or voice coms. And that's fine. Its ilvls are balanced such that for a normal mode raider, there is not much point to running it (still needs some tweaking due to trinkets and set bonuses, but not sure how they over come this fully), at this point i think its much more a perception thing for people that feel they need to run it (valor is another issue, valor gain is too slow this expansion). <br />
<br />
The niche that i refer to that still needs proper filling is the person who wants to run organized raids, but doesn't want to or cant commit to a full time guild with set raid times. These are the people who just run lfr because its better than not raiding or being tied down to a guild they don't have time for. We know there is a decent chunk of people who have gone this route, and is part of the reason allot of guilds are struggling right now. The interesting part here is that the tools for this are already in place. Allow cross realm raiding of the current teir, done. Combine with communities like open raid (or build an in game system like open raid), and people have tools for easily organizing pug raids. Hell, even if they just opened up cross realm raiding for the current teir after x months, patches like 5.3 would be the perfect time for this. The biggest risk here is arguably the reason they don't do it, and that is the potential damage to guilds when you don't &quot;need&quot; a guild to do the most current content. How ever, tools and opportunities like this could potentially be good for guilds as they can utilize the same tools to fill in gaps when some one is a no show, and to help find potential recruits.</div></div><hr />

Seems more like that you are the m***n, they did 1 boss for the top 1%. The rest of the bosses are available to everyone through LFR and normals.

He is not a moron and he actually adressed that issue about normal modes being harder than intended.

<br />
For some people, sure... and this is a good thing, not a bad thing. It would do a lot to encourage pug raids, and for smaller guilds to coordinate 25-man raids together.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raid finder is designed to not be attractive to players that are doing most of the raid on Normal or Heroic difficulty, but for players that don't have a fixed raid group to play with. <br />
<br />
Then don't put rewards in LFR that normal raiders would want to have. I get wanting to allow non-raiding players the ability to get legendary quest items, tier pieces, reputation that valor items are locked behind, etc... but if you put this stuff in LFR, then normal raiders are going to feel obligated to do it. What they should have done was remove reputation requirements from all valor items, make the 502 tier pieces purchasable with valor, and cause bosses in Normal mode and Hard mode to have a significantly higher chance to drop legendary quest items than LFR. Make these legendary quest items able to drop from each boss once each week regardless of difficulty. Normal mode raiders will probably still run the bosses in LFR that they aren't downing yet, but at least the incentive is diminished.</div></div><hr />

Hahahaha, back when Blizzard tried to sell the idea that something like Firelands with their poor 7 bosses was like 14 awesome and totally diferent bosses because you had normal AND heroic, most players tried to show that it was stupid thing to say because dificult setting =/= content.<br />
<br />
Now ppl actually say that (and Blizzard try to say that they're not denying content because a boss in LFR = Normal = Heroic)?<br />

<br />
And your theory about them doing 1 boss for just hardcore raiders being bad is wrong. WoW saw it's peaktime during TBC-WOTLK(correct me if I'm wrong), did they cater for casuals then? No, not really. There was no LFR and only a very few amount of people saw Sunwell while it was new. Only a few people killed Algalon, and the harder Ulduar hardmodes while it was new. Same goes for ICC.<br />
<br />
WoW has been losing subs ever since Cataclysm when LFR was introduced. I'm not saying that it's only because of LFR. But WoW going downhill is definitely not because they do 1 boss that is Heroic only. WoW had it's peaktime when they didnt cater for casuals. People need something to look up to, they need goals that they can strive for when playing the game. Killing something on LFR does exactly the opposite thing.<br />

After reading the front page article and a couple of tweets from GC recently I've become convinced of that. First of all they design content (raids) that they know few few few players will do (at the expense of eliminating other content btw that had a far broader reach) and then they also purposely designed those raids so that 2/3 modes are inaccessible to a huge chunk of the player base that would potentially be interested in doing them. HOw the fuck do you run a business like this? Who the fuck designs a game like this? It's like game development run by the joker or something.<br />

I just told you that they don't design it like that. He has talked a lot about the difficulty of normal modes and 10 man in general and wasn't that what you were complaining about? He is aware of the issues and obviously he is not going to talk about those issues and then do nothing about them.<br />

It's not &quot;a bit&quot; harder than intended. It's actually much more than that. The gap between lfr and normal is HUGE. He's ignorant and willfully ignorant of his own game it seems.

Yes, it's good for those who'd like to see it but have real life stuff going on. However, it also has down side as well and I'll tell you why: Because Blizzard used LFR as a reason for upping the difficulty of raiding normal. Anecdotal of course, but this is exactly what I and plenty of other players that I know had been warning about long before Mr. Hazzikostas now basically admitting as such. Unfortunately, it's too little and too late for quite a few guilds. The prior guild I was in had been formed on day 1 when my server came online, but Mists of Pandaria hurt us more than even Cataclysm had (shared lockout/loot). After all these years, it finally transferred off in mid-March because the raiding population is sparse on Malfurion. And just last night in my current guild (which is also quite old), it was announced that there'd be no more progression raiding for mostly the same reasons.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard is serious about keeping players whose skill level is higher than LFR but not quite there with the MoP incarnation of normal raiding, it needs to bring the difficulty back down.<br />
<br />
<br />
The tons of raid-geared alts didn't happen until Dragon Soul. Then players naturally expected to keep the into 5.0.<br />
I'm not saying there weren't alts before, but the average player having 4-5 happened in Dragon Soul.<br />
We talking about those with LFR gear as well, or just normal/heroic? Because I can tell you, big-time alt raiding first came up during Icecrown Citadel, where you could buy your T10 starter set with Emblem of Frost (http://www.wowdb.com/items/49426-emblem-of-frost) earned from doing your daily LFD. And LFD became a huge laugh for dungeons introduced prior to patch 3.3, with your powerful AoE and being able to straight-up ignore mechanics (Loken (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/28923-loken) and Gal'darah (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/29306-galdarah) come to mind). The fastest dungeon I ever completed was Gun'drak in nine(!) minutes.<br />
<br />
And goodness above, I miss those days. You talk about Cataclysm being alt-friendly? No, it wasn't all that alt-friendly when you use WotLK as the standard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's so comical when they say it like it's something they had absolutely no control over.<br />
<br />
This is what makes my head spin. They had a really successful formula with using dungeons as a catch up mechanism, and most people I know enjoyed the ability to use this path to gear up alts, but they decided not to have any extra 5 man content post initial release in MoP. So I ask myself why did they make this decision? All I can come up with is that they wanted to prove how successful LFR is by forcing people to use it if they want to gear up, then they can say &quot;Look how many people are using LFR&quot; and pat themselves on the back for coming up with a great idea. It's easy to say it would have been nice to have more dungeons while leveling and it would have been even nicer to have more dungeons in one of the patches. <br />
<br />
The result of these decisions for me was that I leveled my alts for professions and have them all sitting, basically unplayed in 463 gear. I raid on my main, I have no desire to burn myself out on that content by doing it on alts in LFR. It's not fun for me and the people in there aren't enjoyable. With 5-mans, I could go in to content with 5 friends anytime I wanted and do something. There's no content available right now that I can do with a few of my buddies....sorry Heroic Scenarios aren't what I'm looking for. So how do I play WoW now. I log on to raid and log off. I have no interest in doing more dailies or one of the original heroic dungeons yet again that I've seen 30 times already. There is NO reason for me to play other than my 2 nights of raiding.<br />
<br />
I'm fine with the existence of LFR, but did it really have to come at the expense of a catch up progression system of JP and dungeons that in my opinion worked very well for two expansion? I'm gonna argue no and I think sub numbers over the next year will support that argument.</div></div><hr />

<br />
IN RAID FINDER, GC your such an idiot sometimes. Gearing up alts in Raid Finder was unbelievable cool. Before you were stuck with one toon. When LFR came out you had a choice of what toon you wanted to play, now its ONE toon or nothing. I think its sorta the Do the dungeon gear up, do the LFR gear up more. Rinse and repeat per patch. Taking away Dungeons was also a TERRIBLE idea. Although I am not sure of the viability of continuing to LFR to gear up. Sounded like an interesting idea. IT seems debunked by all the comments, and personal experience. Lack of gear upgrades probably killed the whole system. Struggling in DS to get that last upgrade, now can even get more than 3.</div></div><hr />

If the raiding player base is only 5% then were still backwards in all of this. Creation of raids takes up far more time and effort than almost anything else in the game and catering to the 5% is almost as bad as catering to the 1. Competitiveness is the least important aspect of wow and it was the least important aspect of sc and diablo 2, in fact I'm not really sure how competitiveness can be the mot important aspect when so few players participate in the raids anyway. Not everybody accepts kill or be killed. Not everyone is a barbarian. They are exactly saying screw you to the majority of their playerbase WHO SUBSIDIZES the creation of raids they have neither the care nor the desire to participate in at the expense of content they may have enjoyed in the past (i.e Dungeons). It's BACKWARDS.<br />
<br />
For the majority of the player base (and I would argue raiding base as well) Competition DOESn'T FUCKING MATTER. THey aren't playing this game as an arms race. Theiy're playing to chill with friends in an easy raid environment. Not be competitive in some pve esport which is lawl btw.</div></div><hr />

Depends on your definition of casual. WoW was casual compared to EQ by the vast gutting of grinds. Lowering the challenge difficulty was not part of the casual equation at the time.</div></div><hr />

HOW ON EARTH ARE THEY SAYING SCREW YOU TO THE MAJORITY? explain me that first.<br />
<br />
And for the majority of the playerbase, competition does matter because it gives you hype. I hope you know how important hype is in games in general. People play this game to chill yes ; but that doesn't mean that people spending years on this game should be unhappy with that decision and like I said they are trying to cater to everybody. <br />
<br />
No game on earth created the majority of the content for their casual players because then games would be boring and pointless. THERE HAS TO BE AN END GAME. Even if people won't be seeing that end game its important that it exists because if players could just chill and do every single thing to do including things like heroic raiding and getting gladiator titles there would be no point to playing this game for so many people. <br />
<br />
Just giving away everything to everbody is not a sign of a good game so please understand that first.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raone</div><div class="date">2013-05-16, 09:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly the the best solution for them is to add a 3rd raid difficulty and make it harder (and make mechanics matter) then LFR, but easier then Normal. Then they won't have to nerf normal by 10-15% anymore because there is already a nerfed mode. Also pugs/alt runs would be happen more, and guilds who hit brick walls can turn the difficulty down to clear ... kinda like you do when trying to kill heroic bosses and time is running out for the week.<br />
<br />
The only flaw is people will be able to clear content faster, but you already can in LFR, so gate this &quot;easier&quot; difficulty the same way you gate LFR. Tons of positives and no negatives.<br />
<br />
Going back to the Wrath models (10's being easier) will piss off a lot of 10 man radiers and make a lot of people quit (including me), but adding a 3rd difficulty harder then LFR will make people happy without upsetting anyone. Plus I would probably log on more and run that with my alts/friends.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The &quot;correct&quot; difficulty setting was BT/MH/Uld/ICC. Easy bosses early on (first few bosses should be free kills more or less), but a gradually increasing difficulty curve (RoS, Archimonde, Mimiron, Professor, etc). It's nice to see they realised their mistake with Horridon's crazy dps requirements in the first few weeks, but this really needs to not happen again. It was the same mistake as Garalon, which took FOREVER to be fixed. How can they possibly make the EXACT same mistake 2 raids in a row?!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty much. Instead of dungeons which required dev time, they gave us LFR which could be scaled off existing content. Then they tell us how great it is and that if we wanna gear up alts, that's our path to do it. Sorry, but it sucks. Not only does it diminish my enjoyment of my regular raid if I'm doing the same content on alts, but there is zero interaction and when you are one of 25 people facerolling content that is designed to require no skill, you don't feel like you're playing a social game. It also requires a longer time investment than dungeons did, and one that is much more open ended. If I had 45 minutes to play, I knew I could log on, hit up guild for a group and do a quick dungeon with people I enjoyed the company of before I had to log off. Now, if I wanna do something that has a chance of upgrading my character I can do the same damned dailies I ground to death on my main, or hope LFR queue pops and maybe we get one boss dead before I have to call it a day. Not to mention that I'm a faceless nothing in a group of 24 other faceless nothings in an LFR group. No one chats, rarely is a positive word spoken and if anything goes wrong the faceless mob turns angry in a hurry.<br />
<br />
What made WoW strong was the social aspect, yet every move Blizzard makes seems to take the requirement to make friends out of the game. What kept people coming back was the people they knew in game, not that quality of the content, and if you remove all the content that requires you to get to know your fellow players, you lose the people who play for that reason. For example, I hadn't done the Isle of Thunder dailies yet and it was a couple of weeks in. I had a friend who I hadn't seen for a very long time log on, so we decided we'd go explore together. After an hour of getting queued for solo scenerio after solo scenario, we both had to go and our time playing together consisted of &quot;gee, I hope this is the last one&quot;. We got to accept the quests together...woohoo. If Blizzard insists on making the game a solo experience (and even tho LFR requires 25 people, it is solo content imo), then the game is dead as far as I'm concerned.</div></div><hr />

Because people are exactly looking to escape from life when they play warcraft. Not replicate the experience they have in doldrum and in tedium at their jobs. World of Warcraft: The McDonalds Crew Trainer experience would never fucking work and nobody would buy it.<br />
<br />
That's the kind of thinking that helps remove all immersion from the game for the sake of convenience. <br />
Its not tedium,its giving people goals to aim for and rewarding them for it. Its progression and its critical to RPG's.</div></div><hr />

This would include the friends and family type guilds that don't remove players because they aren't performing at their best. In Wrath of the Lich King, 10 player normal difficulty raiding served these players well, but there is now a gap between Raid Finder and Normal difficulty.<br />

This is exactly what I was saying to a guildie just two nights ago. Our raid eventually broke up for exactly this reason.</div></div><hr />

Ye - exactly. Few months back they were saying they SPECIALLY focused on making Normal raids harder and less pug friendly :D They change their opinions on things more often than they blink their eyes at this point.<br />

This is exactly what I was saying to a guildie just two nights ago. Our raid eventually broke up for exactly this reason.<br />
<br />
The real issue here is that BLizzard made NORMAL raids harder (they admit to that) and then leave no real content for more social - less hardcore guilds to do other than the least social cotent you will ever see.... LFR.....<br />
<br />
This was pointed to them WAYYY before MOP that this would lead to social aspects of the game dying down within few months. They yet again ignored that like with so many other things in this expansion. They thought they knew best - and ignored every person that dared to point out all the flaws. Thats why WOW is now down to TBC sub numbers and there will be much bigger losses seen this year just because of the general ignorance and arrogance of the dev team.<br />
<br />
Normal raid content in the game should be so that every day player can enjoy it with friends. It doesn't need to be lower 10 man ilvl for that. THEN we have Heroic content if ppl want to push it furhter. Thats for the more hardcore and &quot;less&quot; friends type of gameplay. Not complicated.... but BLizzard yet again managed to screw it up.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Durandro</div><div class="date">2013-05-16, 11:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I suspect they may consider making normal modes (10 and 25 man) slightly easier - or at least take much more care scaling the dungeon bosses in order. ToT was all over the place, with some rather large roadblocks for many people.<br />
<br />
Also, they won't remove LFR. Despite many claims, it was never the reason for the 'death' of PUGS. They still happened during Cata for Baradin Hold. The main problem is the difficulty - most pugs in Wrath only did ToC and the first wing of ICC, and most pugs in TBC did Kara and maybe Gruul/Mag. Many pugs would fail in normal Mogu'shan Vaults, even with ToT raid finder gear!<br />
<br />
I suspect their overall plan will be to make the first half, third or quarter (depending on size) of each normal mode raid (or tier) considerably easier then the rest of it. Thus it gives social guilds a benchmark they can farm until they have the gear to go further, pugs won't be overwhelmed with roadblock bosses and more serious raiding guilds won't be effected since they tend to blast through most of normal mode bosses anyway.<br />
<br />
In ToT terms, this would mean up to Council would be easier and after that the difficulty ramps up. Just as an example.<br />
<br />
Some people might complain that 'casuals' are being catered to, but honestly why should people care what others are doing when they are still far below the benchmark?<br />
<br />
Finally having a 'Looking For PUG' function in the UI might be nice, where you can advertise and search for raids on your server being formed, with class requirements/requests and handy quickcheck functions for seeing people's achievements and gear, and status on the loot system and progression the raid is current at. And being able to invite Real ID friends from cross server would make this much easier also. Thus its LFR with more control over who is in your group, higher difficulty and superior loot along with a more social feel since it'll be with people on your server or friends list.</div></div><hr />

Then they shove dailies down everyone's throats as &quot;content&quot;. Dailies = low effort, low quality content from Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Ye - ofc its the cheapest way to create 10 dailies and call it content and drag it on for months.<br />
<br />
But the reason why we dont have any dungeons now is that the entire dungeon and raid team are focusing on Raids this time around. Thats the ONLY reason why we have few extra bosses in MOP raids. They cut one aspect of the game to add to another. Thats not acceptable and BLizzard should have known better. But like with so much of this expansion... they didn't.<br />
<br />
Just wait next expansion. We be back to 6 boss raids and few dungeons when the real fix is to have 1 dungeon crew and one raid crew that the players that have payed for this game for 8 years REALLY deserve.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destructus</div><div class="date">2013-05-17, 12:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly the the best solution for them is to add a 3rd raid difficulty and make it harder (and make mechanics matter) then LFR, but easier then Normal. Then they won't have to nerf normal by 10-15% anymore because there is already a nerfed mode. Also pugs/alt runs would be happen more, and guilds who hit brick walls can turn the difficulty down to clear ... kinda like you do when trying to kill heroic bosses and time is running out for the week.<br />
<br />
The only flaw is people will be able to clear content faster, but you already can in LFR, so gate this &quot;easier&quot; difficulty the same way you gate LFR. Tons of positives and no negatives.<br />
<br />
Going back to the Wrath models (10's being easier) will piss off a lot of 10 man radiers and make a lot of people quit (including me), but adding a 3rd difficulty harder then LFR will make people happy without upsetting anyone. Plus I would probably log on more and run that with my alts/friends.<br />
<br />
You kinda solved the reverting of current 10 man to wotlk 10 problem with your own post.<br />
Add another 10 man difficulty at wotlk difficulty level for the family/casual guilds and people who hate lfr. Now you can pug again.<br />
They could also make it so this difficulty shares boss saves with lfr, so if you didn't finish a raid in this new difficulty you could do the rest in lfr, but you wouldn't feel forced to run this new difficulty in addition to lfr with the boss saves being shared.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">F-Minus</div><div class="date">2013-05-17, 04:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Imho, having 25 drop higher ilvl througout is no-go anymore, 90% of raiders raid 10 and they wouldn't like that change. <br />
<br />
What they could do however, is that normal 25 drops normal thunderforged equivalent gear, where normal 10 drops normal gear, few leves lower as normal 25. But both drop the exact same heroic gear, to compensate for the slower &amp; lower gearing on normal 10, maybe let bosses in drop 3 instead of 2 items, but only on normal. <br />
<br />
Something like that:<br />
<br />
Normal 25 - ilvl 630<br />
Normal 10 - ilvl 620<br />
------------------------<br />
Heroic 25 - ilvl 645<br />
Heroic 10 - ilvl 645<br />
------------------------<br />
Heroic 25TF - ilvl 655<br />
Heroic 10TF - ilvl 655<br />

<br />
Where did you get that 5% figure, there's way more people raiding than 5%, maybe only 5% reach the final boss, but that's beyond the point. If there would be no raids, every raiding guild could just quit as this is the only thing they really do in the game. Same for me, if there would be no raids, I would just quit... and at that point I tell you the subs they would lose would be not 1.8 million, but a lot a lot more. <br />
<br />
Raiding is part of MMOs you can't just change that.</div></div><hr />

Heroic 25TF - ilvl 655<br />
Heroic 10TF - ilvl 655<br />
This seems like a good plan my only question is would people in iLvl 620 normal gear be able to make the jump to heroic 10s (as heroic 10 and 25s would have to be tuned as they are today).<br />
<br />
It is better than dropping 10s in difficultly completely though as heroic 10s would still fell they had the challenge if they wanted it.<br />
<br />
And I much prefer it to a 4th difficulty level.<br />
<br />
I was thinking of maybe some way of reducing a bosses difficulty &quot;to get past it&quot; but reducing the loot.<br />
<br />
So activating a 10% nerf reduces the ilvl by 10 ilvls and activating a 20% nerf reduces it by 20 or something.</div></div><hr />

Yup. We used to post them as they came out, but that ended up being a mess. Instead, they are now put into categories and used as we have space, unless they are time sensitive or important. If you really want to keep track of tweets you can read them all yourself, but otherwise this has been the best solution so far.</div></div><hr />

They need to prioritize what problems to fix...<br />
<br />
Merge servers and bring back 10/25 lock-outs so that there are actually people on the server and are more willing to pug if they raid more serious in the other lock-out with their own guild.<br />
<br />
I had recently switched to Stormrage US. A high pop server, because my server was dead. It is extremely difficult to pug something that you haven't already did, even with higher populations. Gone are the days of getting a group of random players and figuring out a way to down a boss. Everyone wants achievements. So your left with finding a guild, hoping that guild will let you in a raid spot, or sub for someone. Then hoping they just don't flat out suck and leave you looking for another guild. <br />
<br />
Putting the lock-outs back might be the solution. That way more experienced players can join in with more casuals to fight current tier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sorry I play since mid-Wotlk. When was this time where trade wasn't spammed with &quot;To enter this raid you have to prove you already entered it.&quot;<br />
That above is the real reason Dungeon finder was invented. Because the community was already bad, at least with dungeon finders you're not blocked by other people.</div></div><hr />
