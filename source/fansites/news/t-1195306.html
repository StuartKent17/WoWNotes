Developer Reddit Q&amp;A<br />
Several WoW developers answered questions on Reddit (http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/zqm8d/world_of_warcraft_developer_ama/) tonight. A short summary can be found below, but it is well worth it to read the entire thing!<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
<br />
Player model updates are a high priority and will come with new animations. <br />
Once you complete the legendary gem quest line, you will be able to purchase more gems as needed. <br />
Activision has no effect on the game's direction. <br />
Observer modes are still on the todo list, but require development time and technical improvements before they can be done.<br />
Proving Grounds are still on the todo list and will hopefully make it into one of the Mists of Pandaria patches.<br />
&quot;More developers&quot; is often proposed as a solution to various problems and Blizzard is actively hiring. It is hard to find people that fit within the Blizzard culture and it would be a mistake to hire too many people too quickly.<br />
Combat racials will be improved for classes that lack them.<br />
<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
<br />
The plan is still for more content to be released faster than before to keep players engaged with relevant content and not bored. They are also committed to reducing the time between the last major content patch and the next expansion. <br />
Blizzard is not satisfied with the current status of 25-player raids and are still actively seeking a solution. <br />
Raid Finder and scenarios will hopefully one day make it down to lower level content.<br />
Upon being asked about another raid like Ulduar: &quot;In fact, our next raid zone after these may be right up your alley....&quot;<br />
Ulduar like hardmode toggles will be added as appropriate.<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
<br />
Blizzard would like to make queuing for random bgs better by ensuring some semblance of healer balance between Alliance/Horde.<br />
There are a variety of improvements planed for both rated and unrated BGs.<br />
<br />
<br />
World<br />
<br />
There are some bugs with cross-realm zones, as well as some tweaks that need to be made.<br />
There wasn't time to fix the damage from Deathwing in Stormwind for Mists of Pandaria.<br />
Pandaria has the best in-game storytelling there has ever been in an expansion and there will be more Wrathgate level cinematics, some larger events, and a more interactive and involved story without as much phasing. <br />

Paragon Switching to 10 Man Raiding for Mists of Pandaria<br />
Today Paragon announced (http://www.paragon.fi/news/paragon-will-be-switching-25man-10man-mop) that they will be moving to 10 man raids for Mists of Pandaria. For the new full roster, see their site (http://www.paragon.fi/news/paragon-will-be-switching-25man-10man-mop). <br />
<br />
After Dragon Soul progression many of our players decided to quit the game, some of them were already showing lack of interest during the DS progress raids. In total 34 players took part in DS progress, 14 of which are no longer playing WoW at all. Most of them were longtime core players. On top of that some of our current players can't put in the time anymore as they used to do.<br />
<br />
We were able to get some quality recruits to replace the ones whom had quit, but not enough. So far we had recruited 12 players. It has always been hard for us to recruit new players and we pretty much had the same core of 20+ from late Ulduar to Dragon Soul which played a big part in our success.<br />
<br />
During the beta it became obvious that the current roster will not cut it in MoP unless we get couple of more quality recruits. So far we haven't been able to get the roster we needed and have decided it's better to continue as a 10man guild from now on than to hope for something miraculous to happen in the upcoming weeks. This also leaves time for our players to find a new guild before MoP if they so desire..<br />

Mists of Pandaria Experience to Level<br />
We have definitely been tuning XP in Pandaria, and trying to hit a pace where a character with no rest, no heirlooms, and no guild is leveling comfortably.<br />
<br />
There was a significant decrease in the XP required to level from 87-90 applied a couple of weeks ago, and there was a similar adjustment for level 86 prior to that.<br />
<br />
Completed Kun-Lai Summit today, they lower the req. XP a few patches back so I was able to ding lvl88 by the Summit quests alone finally. It's still tight though, by doing every single quest in the zone I have dinged a few quests before Shado-Pan area (my last questhub) ends. I completed the zone with no rested XP at all and unguilded.<br />
This is pretty much what we're aiming for. We may still need to make a small tweak here or there. <br />
<br />
Do we know the current total XPs required for each level from 85-90? Is this posted somewhere? <br />
<br />
Currently<br />
<br />
86 13000000<br />
87 15080000<br />
88 18980000<br />
89 22880000<br />
90 27560000 <br />
<br />
<br />
The fact is -- most people are in guilds, or do gathering along the way, or run dungeons, or use heirlooms, or build up some rest. Some people only quest in groups (and are therefore able to kill many more enemies per hour). Some only ever play solo.<br />
<br />
The values above may get changed a little bit in the next two weeks, but only if it can be demonstrated that they are still too high. <br />
(Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/235342-is-exp-fixed-yet/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6521203025#18))<br />
<br />
Brewfest Boss Level and Brewfest Dates<br />
Word is, Coren Direbrew has been working out with bigger kegs and he will indeed be a level 90 dungeon boss and his loot has been adjusted accordingly. Pace was something we considered, so we pushed the actual event by just over a week from when it normally happens (which you should be able to see on your in-game calendars now) to give players a bit more time to reach level 89, the minimum level required to queue for the encounter. Oh, we also added a couple more surprises but you’ll have to wait and see. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/235324-brewfest-boss-what-is-his-level-now/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6551355090?page=1#6))<br />
<br />
Challenge Modes Differences<br />
Challenge modes are more than just a timed run. On a basic level, every single creature in Challenge Mode dungeons is significantly stronger than the Heroic version (typically by a larger proportion than you see going from Normal to Heroic raiding, for what that's worth), and where appropriate, additional enemies or new mechanics are added to make sure that the threat of defeat is always present. For many players, simply successfully completing a challenge run is going to be, well, a challenge. That's why we award excellent Valor gains for doing so. Aiming for Silver, let alone Gold, will be something for experienced players to do once they've mastered the content.<br />
<br />
Players who tested the Scarlet Halls challenge mode when that one was open, to name one example, can probably attest that the Armory section of that dungeon is every bit as brutal as anything in Heroic Shattered Halls was in Burning Crusade. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/235225-challenge-modes-more-than-just-a-timed-run/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/5299261018?page=1#3))<br />
<br />
Account Wide Professions<br />
Vanilla was a time of experimentation and 90%+ of the population playing with 1 main. Now it's a chore to level First Aid for alts hence it's difficult to see it seriously in design.<br />
Well, if you look at it like that, why not make levelling and loot account wide too? Shouldn't new characters actually be new? (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/235189-its-time-to-make-first-aid-automatically-given/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/5300150947?page=1#16))<br />
<br />
Class Quests<br />
I personally loved Anathema’s quest line, it was one of the most fun quests I have ever completed, I suppose that's mostly because of the sense of accomplishment it yielded in the end and also because of its higher than usual difficulty level.<br />
That being said, we will have some really nice Monk quests, but for now, although we would love to do more class quests, we are focusing a bit more on faction specific quests. We have 11 classes, that means we would have to use a ton of resources to implement those quests and we just can’t spare them at this moment.<br />
<br />
Storyline and faction-specific quests on the other hand are getting some love; we’re focusing quite a lot on the Alliance VS Horde conflict for Mists of Pandaria, we will use plenty of other ways to help bring that conflict to another level, including for example the usage of scenarios.<br />
We’re really excited about bringing this old and original conflict back into Warcraft again.<br />
<br />
Be prepared for some epic legendary quests though as the expansion progresses! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/235195-class-quests-and-joined-auction-house/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/5300150738?page=1#2))<br />

Pandaren Monk Pet Lore?<br />
Yeah, of all the bizarre pets out there to collect, I have to say I think the little Pandaren is one of the least strange ones, lore-wise — I have a tiny Archangel of Justice following me around most of the time!<br />
<br />
I'm sure each of them can be explained in some way though. Magical error, inter-dimensional rifts, alchemy accident... (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/235182-pandaren-monk-lore/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/5300301386?page=1#5))<br />

Its important because a highly regarded up untill now 25man has done what the majority of other guilds have have done in the past year, switching to 10man because they HAVE to not because they WANT to. <br />

In 8 months they've added 3 new raids, that's a total of 14 bosses plus a new flashpoint and warzone and 3 new sets of PvE gear and 3 new PvP gear, versus WoW's 8 bosses in 10 months. So please get it right before you start shouting your BS.</div></div><hr />

If Paragon goes international, they would be flooded with applications, but i see the problem recruiting awesome Finish player to compete on the level they do. So i don't see those major 25man guilds dying, if they really want to &quot;survive&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heretical statement: Maybe 25man raiding doesn't have to survive.<br />
<br />
It appears that raid size is less about playing with people you enjoy (i.e. the stock blue-post response to creating a new, standard raid size) and more about maximizing rewards. Legendary weapons (a mainstay of PvE progression) were exclusive to 25 man raids until the Firelands; prior to Cataclysm, higher raid sizes were rewarded with higher item levels. Now that 25 man raiding no longer has the incentives it previously had, people are migrating to 10 man raiding.<br />
<br />
The problem stems from balancing the reward-efficiency of multiple raid sizes. If 25 man raiding has too much incentive, it becomes required (in terms of progression raiding). If 25 man raiding has too little incentive, it is abandoned. Creating a standardized raid size would solve the incentive problem and allow encounters to be designed without consideration of how it will work with substantially more or less people.<br />
<br />
And don't worry about abandoning a raid size. They did it in the Burning Crusade, and people kept playing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I too disagree with the ToR bashing, your argument seems kinda invalid seeing as it counts the upcoming (with unknown release date afaict) patch to ToR and doesn't count MoP which is coming in 16 days... <br />
<br />
<br />
Lol random guild news in the post....?!! Sorry but why do I care about a guild I am not part of?!<br />
<br />
Personally, I find it more interesting than all of the news in the rest of the post. Guess some players are interested in the top raiding scene of the game and some aren't (and don't say that guild that was first to clear 2 out of 3 of current expansion's raid tiers isn't a part of the top raiding scene).</div></div><hr />

So please get it right before you start shouting your BS.<br />
<br />
actually they have added ONE set of pve gear, which was mainly cosmetic. set bonus's havnt changed. same with pvp gear. sure the stats increased, but do you consider the 3 levels of t13 to be one set. thought so. as for 14 new bosses, none of them have really interesting mechanics. tank and spank with the occasional tank swap and a puzzle boss. really thoughtful huh. so before you start shouting your BS take at look at what youre defending. SWTOR is a stale game because bioware failed to do anything interesting with it, when the game universe had so much potential. take a look at the new &quot;teir&quot; set. same models as the last one AND the same bonuses. good one.</div></div><hr />

They are a Finnish speaking guild which means they only recruit people who know how to speak and understand Finnish, therefore Finnish people since Finnish is not popular like English, Chinese, or Spanish. The only reason they went 10m is because they couldn't get a real top 25+ Finnish speaking players, not because they want to go 10m or 25m is worse and dying and 10m is better, this part is quite obvious from what they've posted. If they are an international guild like Blood legion or vodka, they're not going to have this problem. Sure you can say 25m is dying, but you can't really say Paragon case is like a nail in the coffin since they're different.<br />
<br />
This is a big news for highend raiding scene and deserve a place on the front page. It's like sports, you only play football and a sport website posting some news about volleyball and can some of you people really said &quot;oh volleyball news is not deserve to be there&quot;?

The thing is that more people need to man up and end their subscribtions.

Blizzard make straight forward features sound like they require a years worth of development.<br />

I just can't escape that feeling I get that WoW is 'ticking over' with a team of people who are polishing what we already have an adding some new features here and there.. but ultimately the drive to make the game the best it can be is else where with Titan.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I´ve had this debate on other sites. The thing is that even with times like the last 4 months of DS or WOTLK... the game is still significantly better than anything else out there. While the raids suck at that point, I still have other fun things to do. A part of it is just the value of my time. I would rather pay to play a quality game rather than play a subpar Free2Play game. Really, my favorite f2p game is DDO, but I have to get very bored in WOW before I will unsubscribe and play DDO. In the next expansion, I think pet battles will end DDO. I probably won´t do pet battles for the first few months, but I have tried them on beta and know how good they are and how addicting they will be.... it is the perfect thing to switch over to when we get long into a raid.<br />
<br />
But I do think the devs learned their lesson this time. I think they have said it in the past, but players just kept subscribing. This time is the first time we have seen a huge drop in subs. The beancounters actually noticed it this time, and it probably gives the devs a little backing when they say they need to create more raids more frequently.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kathranis</div><div class="date">2012-09-12, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">People assuming everything Blizzard mentions is a &quot;promise&quot; is one of the most annoying thing about this community.<br />
<br />
When does Blizzard ever &quot;promise&quot; anything? Hell, just the other day I saw a player complaining that Blizzard hasn't implemented some feature or another that they &quot;promised&quot; to implement, and it wasn't even something Blizzard had ever mentioned. It was an idea that a player had suggested at some point on a forum, and in this idiot's mind, it got warped and twisted around into a promise from Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Here's the facts:<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft: Cataclysm was announced on August 21, 2009.<br />
Fall of the Lich King (Patch 3.3.0) was released in December 8, 2009.<br />
Cataclysm (Patch 4.0.3a) came out December 7, 2010.<br />
That's 12 months of Icecrown Citadel, and 15 months from expansion announcement to release.<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria was announced on October 21, 2011.<br />
Hour of Twilight (Patch 4.3.0) was released on November 29, 2011.<br />
Mists of Pandaria will be released on September 25, 2012.<br />
That's 10 months of Dragon Soul, and 11 months from expansion announcement to release.<br />
<br />
They still have a ways to go, but it's undeniable that they're getting quicker at releasing content with Mists of Pandaria, at least so far.<br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;New Models a Priority&quot; .. they've been saying that for years.<br />
An excellent example of how crappy player memory is.<br />
<br />
They've never said they were a priority until the Press Event in March. For the last six years they've said the opposite: that upgraded models are something they'd like to do, but not a priority.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard is now actively working on them. They were working on dwarves back in March, saying they'd be done around the time Mists of Pandara was ready to launch, and that orcs and humans would come next. At Gamescom, they said they were now working on orcs and humans.</div></div><hr />

I find that somewhat hilarious. There are how many successful 25m guilds out there doing their thing? Our misc guild on a misc server gets plenty of applications all the time. So you may not be able to maintain a top 10 standing in Mists, who cares? <br />
<br />
What a cop out.<br />

<br />
a) I find the Ethereals to be one of the most fascinating races in WoW. It was great to see them come into the cities to offer transmogs and the like. Any plans on the horizon to do more with them, like make them a playable race or something?<br />
<br />
b) Mass summon was a nice perk. I don't quite understand the reasoning behind removing it. With summoning stones available, the &quot;get out and see the world&quot; argument doesn't really pass muster. I don't personally know anyone who thinks removing it was a great idea. We liked it. Why take it away?<br />
<br />
c) Getting players attuned to get up to speed on progression raiding was a pain when all the raids were only available for 25 people. However, now that all raids are also 10-mannable it would be nice to experiment around with again. The experience of first getting attuned for Karazahn (a 10-man raid) was pretty nice. Not requiring it for 25s, but only for 10s could offer a separable difference between the two. Think y'all might toy around with some type of attunement process again in the near future? <br />

<br />
If it would be possible to go back in time, prior to every expansion you see similar things. When they moved from 40 -&gt; 25 mans, people bemoaned the incoming mass exudes. Prior to the Lich King, same thing.<br />
<br />
You have to remember two things: <br />
<br />
First, top raiding guilds have finished all the content months ago, and frankly they are probably bored to tears at this point. Once MoP comes out, I'm sure you will see a certain percentage of the people who left come back. I'm one for example, and most of my guild is in the same boat, they stopped playing months ago, but are all starting to trickle back in as MoP release date approaches.<br />
<br />
Second, this is a matter of 14 players leaving the game. 14. To replace those players, you'd need to find a dozen players with a very strict set of requirements (required to speak Finnish, already be a top raider and be willing to leave their already high level raiding guild to join a new guild). I'm not saying Blizzard should ignore it, but they can't over react to churn months after people have defeated the highest level content. Doing so would be a very bad move on their part.</div></div><hr />

WRONG. They stated that they'd like to do it, but that It won't be ready for MoP release and that they'll focus on Mop for now.<br />
Now that MoP is almost out they bumped them up to high priority. Maybe we get them in a content patch, maybe in the expansion release after MoP.</div></div><hr />

c) Getting players attuned to get up to speed on progression raiding was a pain when all the raids were only available for 25 people. However, now that all raids are also 10-mannable it would be nice to experiment around with again. The experience of first getting attuned for Karazahn (a 10-man raid) was pretty nice. Not requiring it for 25s, but only for 10s could offer a separable difference between the two. Think y'all might toy around with some type of attunement process again in the near future? <br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe next time. :)<br />

Hehe, I've actually asked the Ethereal question but they did not answer :(</div></div><hr />

Player model updates are a high priority and will come with new animations. <br />
<br />
Activision has no effect on the game's direction. <br />
<br />
The plan is still for more content to be released faster than before to keep players engaged with relevant content and not bored. They are also committed to reducing the time between the last major content patch and the next expansion. <br />
<br />
There wasn't time to fix the damage from Deathwing in Stormwind for Mists of Pandaria.<br />
<br />

I just can't take Blizzard seriously anymore. Maybe they actually believe this stuff internally, or maybe they just put it out knowing it's pure propaganda. Either way, I think they have little to no contact with reality or their playerbase. I was seriously contemplating buying MoP and playing regularly again, but no. I'm not going to pay Blizz while they continue to spout the same unbelieveable BS for another two years.</div></div><hr />

Well that's your decision I suppose, but WoW is still by far the best and in depth MMO on the market and nothing comes close in terms of everything from dungeons to features. And come Mists the amount of stuff to do will be as much as every previous expansion combined. I really didn't like Cata, but Mists sure looks amazing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No but seriously, thank god. 40-mans weren't fun, especially when it came to gearing. 25-mans weren't fun, especially when it came to gearing. All the 10-mans were fun, but gearing still wasn't fun. When they split 10 and 25 gearing was still not fun because 10-man was always behind the curve and 25-man had all the good shit, and it was still difficult to gear unless you did both 10 and 25-man. Cata comes around and makes gearing more of a chore instead of road-block in finishing content, but it's still not fun.<br />
<br />
Gearing is not fun. It's just much much easier now than it ever was in the past. I think the only time gearing was actually &quot;fun&quot; was pre-raid vanilla. &quot;I don't know but it looks cool and has a proc!&quot;<br />
<br />
Negativity aside, thank god for new animations. I'm tired of dealing with Troll weapon hand positioning since the game came out. Fist weapons look just look plain terrible, and many weapons don't behave properly with the animations (especially whirlwind, slam and mutilate/raging blow). Offhand weapons was the worst part. My main praise about WoW is the fluid nature of the game, and when you see crap like this it annoys me on a cellular level. Oh god and the stormstrike animation change, that just killed me. (oops I was suppose to put the negativity aside)</div></div><hr />

It's unclear exactly what you are contending here. If it's &quot;all of the above,&quot; that seems nonsensical. In fact all of the bullet points you quoted seem perfectly reasonable.</div></div><hr />

Part time workers and most self-employed can do that.</div></div><hr />

What the hell are you talking about? Do you seek attention by complaining about random stuff?<br />
<br />
I came here to see people's opinions about model updates, but as always, nothing satisfies you and I see only bitching and complaining. Blizzard finally decided to update player models after the community begged them to, now people bitch about that too.<br />
<br />
I advise Blizzard to NOT update models. Even if they are better, the vocal minority still didn't pull out the twig up their ass and they will make sure to complain about their shitty nostalgia.</div></div><hr />

I can automatically tell that you have not played the beta (or if you did, didn't pay attention,) haven't read anything about the actual lore, and are attempting to lambast the game for things you haven't a single clue about.<br />
<br />
You would do better laughing at yourself in front of a mirror if you didnt know they were made as an aprils fool joke. You probably started during cata anyways, doubt have any clue of anything.</div></div><hr />
