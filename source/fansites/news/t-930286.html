<br />
After clearing the encounters in normal mode, the entire raid changed faction to reset their raid ID and started working on heroic encounters shortly after, that kind of thing happened in the past and it's not really surprising to see it used again to grab first kills. <br />
<br />
As I write these lines, Stars killed Shannox in Heroic Mode. It's not really my place to judge if something is against the rules or not and I will just keep tracking heroic first kills as they happen. <br />

Eternal Embers and Seething Cinders Droprates<br />
You’re assuming the drop chances for embers averages out to .5 per boss in 10’s and 2 per boss in 25’s, which it doesn’t. Whether you’re in 10’s or 25’s you’re going to see an equal drop average for Eternal Embers per player, and the same can be said for Seething Cinders. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/183543/remarkably-unkind-design-decision-long) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2743686388?page=5#89))<br />

New Content - Differences between PvE and PvP Players<br />
The answer to your question revolves around a common difference in how PvE players and PvP players approach the game. Generally speaking, PvE players want more quests, more dungeons and more raids to experience -- more and new content is king. On the other hand, while some PvP players do want new maps, many others would be happier if we perfected the Arena or BG maps that already exist - or even if we cut existing maps. After all, PvP players don’t graduate out of Arathi Basin or Dalaran sewers the same way PvE players graduate from dungeon to heroic, or raid tier to raid tier. We did make some improvements to the existing PvP maps, such as trying to return Ring of Valor to circulation and changing the way flags work in Eye of the Storm (for rated play).<br />
<br />
We’d love to add a lot more maps than we currently do, but we need to do it in such a way that doesn’t make the PvP experience worse for players who are more interested in refining their PvP experience than in seeing new maps.

Patch 4.2 Hairstyles<br />
We had a bunch of hairstyles we threw in for testing on the PTR and the majority of them did not pass the test. (quality, art direction, bugs, etc.) (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/183531/why-are-some-races-not-getting-the-new-hair) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2743685855?page=2#26))<br />
<br />
Patch 4.0 Raids now puggable<br />
We specifically intend for the 4.0 raids to be puggable now that Firelands is out. Grabbing some tier 11 by way of Justice, quest rewards, plus across the board difficulty nerfs should really be enough to get them going.<br />
<br />
The patch has only been out a day or so though. I think it'll probably take a little bit before people really get it into their heads that they should be pugging the previous tier because it's not too hard to be successful. It's just getting people used to the various encounters and mechanics.<br />
<br />
Maybe people are waiting for the holiday weekend? If nothing else, leading one yourself is always an option. I think we'd agree that we need some better ways to get pug raids together considering we intend to follow the &quot;New Raid is Hard, old Tier is Puggable&quot; format from here on. <br />
<br />
Still unsure what that means regarding the final raid (i.e. Deathwing). Do pugs not get to see him until the next expansion is released? (Not saying whether that's a good thing or not, but personally I enjoyed getting to Arthas on some of my alts without spending near as much time as I did on my main.)<br />
In ICC we had a stacking raid buff over time which gradually made the content easier. Not saying we’ll do that exact thing again but the philosophy was around even then that everyone who wants to can eventually see the content, but it’s going to take very organized groups (which typically means raiding guilds) to see the encounters first.<br />
<br />
So casuals will constantly be a tier behind for the rest of the life of this game? If that is what is actually coming out of your mouth I'll save myself the time and unsub now. What a piss poor vision for your game. There are normal and heroic versions of raids for a reason. That heroic difficulty was implemented so that the two segments of the population (casual and hardcore) would both have something to do. You are now bifurcating the raiding population AGAIN, by telling casuals that they have to run around in the left overs.<br />
Trying to label all of our players as “casual puggers” vs.” hardcore raiders” is ridiculously simplistic. Among raiders there is an enormous diversity of players. There are those who will raid virtually every night when new content is out, to guilds that raid once a week (and even then will cancel raid nights fairly commonly). If you must try to label raiders, you’d be closer to the Blizzard model if you said normal mode is for organized raids, heroic mode is for more hardcore organized raids, and the previous tier of content (and Baradin Hold) is targeted for pick-up groups. Also consider that even within a raid zone we try to design easier bosses (usually near the front) and more challenging ones (usually at the end) which can help blur those lines and offer smoother transitions for each category.<br />
<br />
Overall, we think you’ll have a better experience playing World of Warcraft if you play with friends, either existing or those you meet in game. WoW, while much more solo friendly than most older MMO games, is still intended as a multiplayer game. We provide features like Dungeon Finder for when playing with friends isn’t possible, and as we said above, we’d like to offer more features like that.

Tabards Tab<br />
Are there any considerations for a tab for your tabards?<br />
Yes! <br />
<br />
[...] To clarify: he asked if we were considering it, and yes we are considering it. :) (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/183516/tabard-tab-request) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2743807071?page=1#2))<br />
<br />
Keyring Removal<br />
On a serious point though some people are upset about the removal of the key ring. While that seems like we're just taking it out to be bullies, it specifically frees up storage space we can then make into useful features. Not that it will specifically be used for 'tabard storage', but we are going to be using the space the removal of the key ring freed up.

<br />
Thrall and Aggra's &quot;wedding&quot;<br />
Correct. Their pledging of their lives to one another was essentially their 'wedding', although I'm sure Orcs don't use such nomenclature to refer to these things. Maybe 'life bond' fits better.

<br />
Does Blizzard plan on adding the rest of the dungeons and raids to the Dungeon Journal?<br />
Absolutely. With the time it takes to present a single boss in the Dungeon Journal we were only confident supplying Cataclysm content with the release of the feature in 4.2, but we are on a path to filling it out with all dungeons and raids in the entire game.

This isn't even possible, Rainbow Generator needs a target to be used since it's an attack, but you said you used Thunderfury to kill the worg so you can't have done them at the same time.<br />

I see a three day ban incoming from the start of next week's raid reset and whatever heroic kills they achieve scratched off their record. The reason Blizzard doesn't allow guilds to move straight into heroics after completing normal mode is pretty simple: if the top guilds cleared all the content in one week instead of two, that's one less week they have to work on 3.3.<br />
<br />
Kidding. But seriously, this is exploitative and I can't see Blizzard letting it slip without repercussions. They should have gated stuff more than simply the transition from normal to heroic, too, to prevent guilds even having a shot at heroic Ragnaros for a couple of weeks at least. But at least this time around we can hope that they won't do what they did with LK and nerf heroic mode by 5% every few weeks until someone gets him down.</div></div><hr />

It falls under &quot;obtaining a competitive advantage over other players&quot; in the EULA. Or in other words, exploiting, which can oftentimes result in permanent account suspension based on the severity of the exploit taking place. The fact that these actions were premeditated won't help their case with Blizzard's customer support staff. You can say you were testing the encounters as much as you want, but the straight facts is you did something with the full intent on gaining a competitive advantage over other players and maximum punishment should be expected.</div></div><hr />

Err why couldn't blizzard do shit about it? Server transfers already prevent this. I believe in the US and EU faction transfers also do, it's just that they have some behind the times servers. I'm not 100% on that though. Either way, blizzard damn sure can do something about it. Aside from banning them if they felt inclined, they could also make sure that raid ids persist across all transfers.<br />

Yes, atm Faction transfers for US and EU realms do not wipe raid lockouts... otherwise this would have been happening back at the beginning of Cata. If you need proof, it's in their FAQ faction transfers. <br />
<br />
&quot;Will my raid IDs be reset following a Faction Change?<br />
Your pre-existing raid locks will not be removed or reset completely, but your character will be assigned appropriate raid IDs for those bosses you have already defeated earlier in the week&quot;</div></div><hr />

I pretty sure that rule apply to players under same realm or battlegroup, not across the world (or else US is always &quot;obtaining a competitive advantage over UE players&quot; same for the for UE and TW etc..., and people with high spec computers or high bandwidth connections are always &quot;obtaining a competitive advantage over other players&quot; who dont have)</div></div><hr />

No. Blizzard knows that people will forget about this in less than 2 weeks. So no It doesn't matter, they paid, so they most likely wont get banned. No one will quit WoW due to ONE first kill that was only possible due to blizzard's policies. Come on, let's be logical.</div></div><hr />

High end guilds such as Ensidia and such xfer to other realms for the sake of realm first<br />
Blizzard did not like that so therefor whenever you ''xfer'' you lose your eligibility to get realm first for 3 months in addition you keep your ID's from the last reset<br />
<br />
So technically it's going to work just like this, ID lock wise - Whenever you faction change<br />
<br />
Your ID still remains</div></div><hr />

There is indeed a rule that is against this sort of thing. It is under C. Rules Related to Game Play..<br />
<br />
<br />
(i) Using or exploiting errors in design, features which have not been documented, and/or &quot;program bugs&quot; to gain access that is otherwise not available, or to obtain a competitive advantage over other players;<br />
If you faction change in the US or the EU your raid ID won't get reset, which means that this is an error in design and/or &quot;program bug&quot;. <br />

No, but they exploited a paid service to get access before other guilds. It's hardly a fair playing field and certainly shouldn't be news worthy, let alone promoted as a &quot;world first&quot; kill.</div></div><hr />

That's the thing though. On US and EU servers, faction changes don't reset the raid ID so it isn't available to everyone for the purpose that STARS used it for. This is an oversight on the Asian servers. <br />

Why would they be proud of such a thing. Being first implies that there is a competition of more than one. In this case there is no such thing. So, they came first while playing against...nobody. Hardly a thing to be proud of, and certainly not a competition.<br />
<br />
Personally I do not care much about these &quot;competitions&quot; anyway, since they are unfair to the various guilds the way things are right now. Guilds don't get the chance to start playing at the same time since the patch is applied at different times at different zones, Some realms may have problems at the beginning of a patch or even for days or weeks after etc, and there are no specific rules, like players playing with just one character and not alts etc.<br />

Don't be ignorant, microtransactions are not game mechanics. Using a paid service to gain access to something that should not be available until the next raiding week is not its intention. This is highlighted by several statements and actions by Blizzard:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Paid services offer vanity, or otherwise non-advantageous bonuses for players. Anything that provides an in-game advantage to one player over another who doesn't pay for such a service is not offered by Blizzard. Assuming quite reasonably that this is still their view, faction changing to reset your raid lockout only be seen as a non-intentional violation of Blizzard's own policy, given it allows you to bypass the whole purpose of the raid lockout system.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
After Ensidia server transferred during Trial of the Grand Crusader progression, Blizzard changed it so that raid lockouts were no longer reset when doing so. This can only have been done to prevent more guilds from transferring to buy an additional fifty attempts.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Stars were removed from the raid shortly after killing heroic Shannox, presumably after Blizzard noticed and realised what they were doing. If Blizzard thought this to be an acceptable way to behave, they would not have done anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard also took down the Taiwanese Battle Net faction transfer system for 'emergency maintenance', it's far too much of a coincidence for this to not be related to what has happened.</div></div><hr />

On one hand, it cost them a small fortune, so it paid off.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if Blizzard is okay with this, what stops them from putting an ingame Raid ID reset for XX bucks per person? Thats just not right IMO. It basically already is paying for getting in game advantage over the others, something old Blizzard didnt approve of at all.<br />
<br />
Oh well, unless I see loot removed and several days of ban, I suspect we are heading towards more and more extra transactions for more basic stuff. Maybe next patch we will have to pay extra for getting inside the new raid? :p</div></div><hr />

Working at intended, and it is still the same thing guilds did when Lich King was released in ICC. You could faction change or server change, and get another 50 attempts in at it.<br />

And yet All of Ensidia's kills aren't labeled as their past guild names just because they contain the same players. So the guild does matter and it isn't something that can be just brushed off. In the realm of world firsts, names and stuff matters.</div></div><hr />

True, but unfortunately for them no one who actually matters will consider their kill a world first. By paying to beat the competition, they're openly stating they feel they couldn't compete on fair ground, and had to resort to buying their way to the top. No one in the top tier community is interested in a guild who can't win through their own merit; reputation and integrity are far more important than a 'world first' which no one else attempted to attain. What the generally illiterate and ignorant posters of MMO-Champion think doesn't matter to the people in top guilds. They are the ones directly affected by this, they are the people whose opinion matters.</div></div><hr />

Because the only reason a &quot;first&quot; would mean anything is if everyone (at least all the major players) is on equal grounds. No one should have an advantage like this. They're world first out of 1 guild (themselves). Grats. Sure in the past Asian guilds have gotten content later. That sucked.

How so? Many guilds barely got normal modes done with BOT and BWD. Once they got to heroic modes that's where they struggled. Maybe one or two bosses down and that was it. I mean really how many guilds cleared every boss in heroic mode? Just because some guilds have gotten normal modes down doesn't mean anything. They're very good guilds and it's expected they will get it down fast. They focus on heroics and nothing more. Everyone else will struggle with the normal modes specifically the end bosses in Firelands I'm sure just like last tier.<br />
<br />
Remember these guilds clearing the normal modes don't speak for most guilds.</div></div><hr />

The whole world-first &quot;race&quot; is a joke anyways, would you take an olympic race serious, where certain contestants start a minute after the others (different realm restarts in different regions), and some of them forced to carry 'round a heavy ball and chain (playing on a crowded server with huge lag)?

<br />
It's a race for the first kill and when you do it alone (because using and outgame feature to do it is not &quot;part of the game&quot;), no matter how long it takes you no matter how you do it, you will allways grab the World First. I don't think you can call it cheating but they can not claim it as a World First since &quot;World&quot; here means only Stars.<br />
<br />
They raced alone nothing to be proud about, and doing it so fast make it level to normal modes for guilds of such talent, i think the only World First worth talking about is Ragnaros'</div></div><hr />

<br />
As I said, if this was an actual competition with clear rules, and they didn't cheat, then it would be their win. But such a competition doesn't exist. In what exists, as far as I can understand there are rules about achieving a kill through in-game mechanics, that was not an in-game mechanic. In Nefarian's kill, in-game mechanics were used, and maybe even abused, so at least that rule was not broken. It was a kill, that they deserved, no one helped them to achieve it, but it is not a world first kill while strictly using in-game mechanics, because that competition begins from the next reset. It is a world first kill in the category of buying advantages with real money.</div></div><hr />

You're right. They killed a heroic boss quickly so grats to them. But they're &quot;world first&quot; out of only 1 guild. Whoever kills it w/o transferring will be world first out of thousands. Get it? Simply KILLING these heroics bosses is no big feat for any of the top guilds. Of course they're going to kill them...and they're going to kill them fast. <br />
<br />
The only reason stars did this is because they knew they probably couldn't beat a few of the other top guilds out there. They wanted to have the earliest kill no matter what. Now everyone will look down upon them because of it. Grats.</div></div><hr />

There's no way of telling if Ensidia exploited Lich King on purpose or not as most hardcore raiders used Saronite Bombs to increase their dps - so if it was accidental then there would of been no way of telling if it was the bombs causing the platform to respawn or something else.<br />
Also Blizzard fixed the faction change resetting lockouts a while ago, so it wasn't intended.. apparently the &quot;fix&quot; was broken in a recent patch (mb 4.2?) so it's definitely an exploit and imo they should be banned for it as it's 100% clear they faction changed to reset the lockout and it wasn't clear that Ensidia purposely exploited LK at all.</div></div><hr />

There wasn't an &quot;Arena Point Cap&quot; that was removed by using paid transfer before (is it even removed now?). At the old days your arena points where gained once every week and how much you got was calculated by how much rating you had, using a transfer would lower your rating and would be retarded.<br />

TW was 2 days behind US on 4.2 release and 1 day behind EU which were 1 day behind US. <br />
That's NOTHING, they just cheated the system to get a week headstart on heroics, that's why they are getting their heads bashed, if they did it on a Tuesday when US gets their heroics started then I'm certain that people wouldn't mind.</div></div><hr />

I give props to these guys. I think it's neat to be dedicated to a game so much to actually drop money to be able to keep progressing and enjoying the game. Not something I would do and I do raid but I'm also not so set on being a world first gamer. Take it as a lesson to make the changes necessary so it doesn't happen again if it isn't supposed to work this way. This has be done before. I've known quite a few people who have done this especially for Shadowmourne in Wotlk and in Cata as well. Of course not an entire guild. Having 25+ people FC all the sudden right after a patch.... from the same server and faction.... shouldn't that have caused some attention from Blizz before they entered the raid again?<br />

one-day vs one-week is not what I was talking about. I talking about time frames that top guilds need to get their world first kill. all of top guilds never start at the same line. What Stars did was just put them a week ahead so they get earlier start just like how US guilds get their server up.

<br />
one-day head start, No, one HOUR head start is already a big handicap for the top guilds, they can do all sorts of amazing things in just that small time frame.

<br />
Implement the big patch and have normal mode turned on with launch, but hard mode disabled. Then once every region finishes with their patch and are all clearly stable, at some fixed time, turn the switch on for hard mode for everyone at the same time. And make it so you don't have to clear normal mode to do hard mode, cause really, every guild can make that call for themselves.<br />
<br />
Just to explain my point more clearly, I'll walk it through with an example. Weekly maint goes as usual and servers come up. Anyone who wants to try normal modes is welcome to go for it when their server comes up. Since TW is the last region and they come up on Thursday, agree that say noon GMT on Friday is the time that heroic mode is turned on for everyone simultaneously. This way the guilds that want to be in the running for heroic modes leave a raid group unsaved and wait patiently for the race to start on Friday and when Blizzard turns on the switch, they all can start the race at exactly the same time.</div></div><hr />

Other guilds can get to the same point in around 1 week from when they killed the boss ergo a week head start.

you are right about others guilds can get to the same point (starting HM) in around 1 week, but they DO NOT START the race at the same TIME. US servers will always get started FIRST, EU second then Taiwan. If a boss took 1 day to practice and get a kill, Taiwan guilds will always 1 day behind US and EU progress regardless of skills. get it?<br />
<br />
Now if you call getting head start is cheating then Blizzard been giving advantages to US guilds all along?? but you still call it legitimate kill from a US guild then why Star's kill is not legitimate?<br />
<br />
of course, I don't deny that they exploited the rule to get starting HM first, but the kill itself is legitimated. They don't get extra attempts like Grand Trial of the Crusader, they just get head start LIKE US servers always do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
World first have hardly even been a true mark of skill, nor has it ever been a fair race. It has been of my understanding that other regions, such as the one Stars is in, have on many occasions received content much later than other regions. They're effectively left out of the race, but do we see the world stop for them so we all can begin on a fair footing? No. Also, they don't even have a ptr afaik. <br />
<br />
Money is just a resource, just as any other thing like time(and imo, far more valuable than a measly 25$ to transfer). You use it, you spend it. If your not willing to make the sacrifices it takes to win, don't be surprised when you get left behind. <br />
<br />
I take it blizz will do something. Having everything cleared in the first week sorta makes them look bad.</div></div><hr />

I believe what you are saying is bullshit. I have some evidence. When you look at most of the world's first kills since Cata you realize Stars has 0. While Paragon has 6. Method has 3. And For the Horde has 1. It's safe to say that Stars might be out gunned, despite being the 5th guild world wide.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly. <br />
<br />
And just like it has been stated, you can't do the same thing they did in Europe or USA servers so if you think that is fair then you clearly don't know what fair game is. Fair enough, Ensidia did it in the past and it was annoying and unfair as hell already then but I guess Blizzard didn't fix it without a reason?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does paying IN REAL LIFE MONEY to migrate to the USA to get a day advantage count as exploiting? BAN THEM!On a more serious note, the faction change gimmick was available to every guild so there isnt an UNFAIR advantage. This is similar to multi-boxing, it grants the user an advantage over other users but it is available to everyone therefor its not an unfair advantage, aka not an exploit.<br />
<br />
<br />
We learned of Stars doing this within 20 mins of them faction transferring and an agreement was made on IRC between us, Paragon and some other top guilds that we would not use this tactic and wait for a fair race next week.They won't be listed on wowprogress for these kills so they are out of the race as far as the other top guilds are concerned. The problem comes if they get their kill(s) removed but are still able to compete legitimately next week. They will have a lot more heroic experience than the rest of us and so still be at an advantage. If they are allowed to keep their gear they will have an even bigger advantage.It's funny because of the whole storm Stars kicked up over our atramedes kill, accusing us of using an exploit we didn't even know about (LoSing the modulation) and concluding by telling us to 'fight with honour'. The level they have stooped to here is about as dishonourable as you can get.<br />
<br />
Im happy for you that you were able to create your own dreamworld where Stars does not excist and you can continue your race for (dream)World Firsts with the other guilds in your very own world :)</div></div><hr />

Of course, that much is abundantly clear. The problem is an old one which should be changed, but probably never will be down to resources required etc. That doesn't make it right what they did however purely down to the fact that they literally paid money for a second shot at the same lockout which other guilds didn't / couldn't do. And if you want to bring other Taiwanese guilds into it...why should they alone have a head start over every other TW guild? That alone has its own rankings and it screws everyone else over.</div></div><hr />

The race has been going on much longer than just Cata. Im talking about all the expansion. TBH, I wouldn't be particularly proud of any world first. It's not a fair playing ground to begin with, granted a bit better come cata.<br />
<br />
They're not avoiding competition, they're leaving it behind. Given the freedom to transfer, im sure many other guilds will follow them come the next competition. Personally, I don't like it but it's really not as bad as it seems. Players do alot of things to stay on top, such as rerolling, participating the the ptr etc. While these aren't neccessarily bought with money, it costs time. Im sorry bit if you willing to put more than 3hrs into a character 25$ is hardly comparable.<br />
<br />
Should it exist? probably not. It doesn't add anything to the competition. I mean either way, if people eventually follow or if Stars is brought back down, it ends in the same playing field.</div></div><hr />

Yes it's Blizzard's fault for not closing that obvious bug before, but that doesn't make it any more valid for Stars to exploit that bug. Stars used to be the &quot;guys who do really well despite being at a big disadvantage&quot;, but now they're just &quot;those guys who cheat&quot;.

What their competition thinks of them really doesn't matter. In the realm of public opinion what matters is the publics opinion. And while they managed to get this kill through what can probably be seen as unsportsmanlike conduct, much of the public doesn't really view this as a sport. <br />
<br />
As far as world first is concerned, they fought the actual fight and they didn't do anything underhanded in the encounter itself. And consequently, they killed the boss before anyone else in the world killed the boss. So to many, they have the world first.<br />
<br />
On a side note, many people say the US starting 2 days early is nothing and not a big deal. Well, if 2 days is nothing, surely 5 days can't be all that much either. This is after all one big reason to not respect any of this world first nonsense as its not a fair race to begin with.<br />

First of all, they should congratulated for getting a heroic kill fast. But since we don't know how long they worked on it, we can't say it's the fastest (aka world's first) kill yet. Technically, yes it is, but that's simply because others didn't get the chance to work on it. I'm pretty sure Blizzard wants to keep the competition going between the top guild so they'll remove their kill and possibly ban them. Let's see what happens next reset to see who really deserves that world first FoS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, there is no evidence they fought the actual fight. Once you are caught cheating your actions are suspect. And there is no evidence that they actually did the fight as intended.

And this is a guild that bitched over Paragon's non-exploiting Nef kill and Method's clearly unaware-of-bug kill. I find it a bit odd that a guild that runs around telling people to &quot;fight with honor&quot; has no problems taking a cab part of the way down the race.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's an exploit to bypass an in-game raid timer. They didn't design it like that, it's basically an oversight on Blizz's part and some people were nerdy enough to pay money to take advantage of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all, they should congratulated for getting a heroic kill fast. But since we don't know how long they worked on it, we can't say it's the fastest (aka world's first) kill yet. Technically, yes it is, but that's simply because others didn't get the chance to work on it. I'm pretty sure Blizzard wants to keep the competition going between the top guild so they'll remove their kill and possibly ban them. Let's see what happens next reset to see who really deserves that world first FoS.<br />
<br />
So do we consider Paragon's World 1st kill for Heroic Ragnaros legit when Blizzard had them design the encounter?<br />
<br />
Blizzard is constantly creating these situations and yet, people are faulting the guilds and raids for exploiting. If Blizzard had their s*** together and paid attention to these issues rather than putting in new /roar emotes, guilds and raids wouldn't have to resort to these methods.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rafy</div><div class="date">2011-07-01, 06:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It falls under &quot;obtaining a competitive advantage over other players&quot; in the EULA. Or in other words, exploiting, which can oftentimes result in permanent account suspension based on the severity of the exploit taking place. The fact that these actions were premeditated won't help their case with Blizzard's customer support staff. You can say you were testing the encounters as much as you want, but the straight facts is you did something with the full intent on gaining a competitive advantage over other players and maximum punishment should be expected.<br />
<br />
no it doesn't fall under that.<br />
the didn't gain advantage over other players without others being able to do the same.<br />
that means you can do the same.<br />
every guild can do the same.<br />
it's not exploiting, hacking, etc. w/e you want to call it.<br />
They can just simply say: &quot;hey we just decided to change factions because we like X better than Y.&quot;<br />
Deal with it and stop crying.<br />
Pretty sure most of you didn't even down 2-3 bosses anyway...</div></div><hr />

This is totally different. The lockout resets could also be countered by having alts. What Stars has done is something that is literally impossible within game mechanics, they ran the instance on HM during the first week. That's SUPPOSED to be impossible, but they exploited a faction change to get around that.</div></div><hr />

Nothing about dungeon or raid locks are even mentioned there, so it can be presumed that this isn't an exploit by the FAQ's standards. The ToU, of course, could still screw the guild over and Blizzard could simply do them in if they felt so inclined.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regardless of that, it's still a rather clever move but definitely not something I'd shell the money out to do. It astonishes me that ~25 people would willingly pay a small fee just to get something as trivial as a &quot;world first&quot; in a video game. Is it an achievement? I suppose so, but you don't get rewarded anything for it. You get a few months worth of fame that quickly dies down, and then forgotten about when the next raid comes out.<br />
<br />
<br />
What's more amusing is the amount of people in this topic alone that feel somewhat &quot;ripped off&quot;, as if most of them would have had a shot in getting the achievement in the first place. It's a game. A world first is a nice achievement but at the end of the day, do you really want that to be your life's greatest achievement? If you got paid for it (which, admittedly, some of the top-end guilds do) then sure, go ahead, but most people probably don't.<br />
<br />
[e] Oh, and to the people trying to pull this off as &quot;not official&quot; because &quot;Wowprogress doesn't allow it&quot;: Wowprogress isn't an official ranking system, therefore the kill count is only &quot;not official&quot; for Wowprogress.<br />
<br />
There is no official status for &quot;world firsts&quot;, &quot;official&quot; meaning that it's monitored by Blizzard or supported by Blizzard. Blizzard generally don't deal in world firsts, however. The last time world firsts were mentioned was on the old WoW Armory, and this was specifically for defeating end-bosses like the Lich King or Ragnaros, in this case.</div></div><hr />

Why do people still think Paragon tested content for Blizzard that wasn't open to everyone else? THAT WAS AN APRIL FOOLS JOKE. Don't believe me? Look at the original post, and then read the dungeon journal. You will realize that it isn't the fight the listed. Probably can't do that so here's the link: http://www.paragon.fi/articles/sneak-peek-ragnaros-firelord there you go.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rafy</div><div class="date">2011-07-01, 06:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, but they exploited a paid service to get access before other guilds. It's hardly a fair playing field and certainly shouldn't be news worthy, let alone promoted as a &quot;world first&quot; kill.<br />
<br />
so let's ban everyone who got to do the dailies in 4.2 before the reset, while others couldn't even log on their realms ok?<br />
because they clearly had an advantage over others...<br />
God, you people are stupid sometimes...</div></div><hr />

That ^<br />
<br />
Considering Ensidia got banned for their rogue using his normal rotation on the Lich King then I shudder to think how this will be viewed. THe simple fact is, as the guy above said, accessing heroics in the first week is NOT MEANT TO BE POSSIBLE. If it was, they would just allow you to do it like in ToC. They don't, and I willl be amazed if there are no repercussions for this.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sicness</div><div class="date">2011-07-01, 06:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What their competition thinks of them really doesn't matter. In the realm of public opinion what matters is the publics opinion. And while they managed to get this kill through what can probably be seen as unsportsmanlike conduct, much of the public doesn't really view this as a sport. <br />
<br />
As far as world first is concerned, they fought the actual fight and they didn't do anything underhanded in the encounter itself. And consequently, they killed the boss before anyone else in the world killed the boss. So to many, they have the world first.<br />
<br />
On a side note, many people say the US starting 2 days early is nothing and not a big deal. Well, if 2 days is nothing, surely 5 days can't be all that much either. This is after all one big reason to not respect any of this world first nonsense as its not a fair race to begin with.<br />
<br />
This couldn't be more wrong, no offense. <br />
<br />
When you're competing with other people for something you expect their recognition when you achieve something, not recognition from random people who are completely outside the matter. When a guild gets a world first the other top guilds will acknowledge them getting it. That's what matters. Not the million other people who have no idea of what it takes to get where you're at, or the people who think they have some idea but really don't, or the people who don't care at all. Your competition's respect is what matters when it comes to competing, not respect from random people, and Stars likely lost a lot of it from their competition with this move.<br />
<br />
This is true for anyone who competes with others for anything. Sports, work, anything in the world, even video games.</div></div><hr />

I don't go to Paragon's website, I'm speaking off what I've read off forums. Even if that is incorrect, it's nothing more than a bad example on my part. The fact still remains Blizzard creates these situations, does not test new content thoroughly enough, and spends their time working on useless things like new haircuts at the barbershop and /roar emotes than prevent these situations from happening. Those are facts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually it's arguable that nearly EVERY exploit could be repeatable by people other than the exploiters.<br />
<br />
Archimonde Stump? Hey not an exploit. Everyone can do it!<br />
<br />
Disgusting Oozelings? Again totally fine.<br />
<br />
Pretty sure they all didn't accidentally change factions. At the same time. Then reformed and started raiding. It's an exploit and angrily lashing out won't change that.</div></div><hr />

By that definition nothing would be exploiting, because if you can exploit something I can exploit it too. Every guild from #1 to #10000 knows you can reset your lockouts by transferring, the difference is that other guilds fight with honor while STARS chose to cheat and disqualify themselves from the T12 race. They should kick whoever made this decision, take a summer break, and hope to get some legitimate kills in T13 because honestly everything they do in T12 now will be tainted.</div></div><hr />

What you misunderstand completely. It's not the same people who are putting those &quot;useless&quot; things in that are responsible for encounter design. Do you honestly believe that they benched people from Firelands design to make the new /roar emotes?!? Not everyone is Chris Metzen!</div></div><hr />

Agree 100% to that!<br />
<br />
To summarize all inputs here is.. you yourself decide wheter or not this is world fist.<br />
I personally dont count it since i am a &quot;sportsman&quot;, but if any of you feel to consider it a world first thats fine.<br />
My guess is that the genral opinion is not world first. I hope they get their raid id reset and let into the game asap so they can clear normal mode and next wednesday can go on with heroic version again and set new world first if they manage that.</div></div><hr />
