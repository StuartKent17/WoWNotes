Warlords of Draenor - UI Improvements<br />
Today we are taking a look at a few of the UI improvements coming in Warlords of Draenor. <br />
<br />
<br />
The Dungeon Journal now includes short overviews of the fight for each role, which should help players that don't know the fights. <br />
The Key Binding UI has also been improved to a tabbed list rather than a very long list you have to scroll through. <br />
You are now able to manage addons in game without having to log out. The Simple Addon Control (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/simple-addon-control) or Addon Control Panel (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/acp) addons will do the same thing now.<br />

I don't mean to be a pain, but it seems Scent of Blood &quot;requires&quot; multistrike, is this meant to be the case? or just in addition<br />
Yes, it is. Blood gets some Multistrike baseline though. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466009570683265024))<br />
<br />
Two questions I'd love public clarification on. 1. Do you intend to fix the bug with Reaping and DeathFrost Runes?<br />
It's on our list, but I don't know when it'll get fixed. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466093125501337600))<br />
2. Using Icy Touch to convert Frost Runes to Death Runes for AoE feels awkward. Anything being done there?<br />
No, we designed it such that that only comes into play if you AoE for long periods, or don't prepare (so are encouraged to). (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466093485074812928))<br />
But do you feel that will still apply in a WoD world where we're also slowed down considerably and transition and out and AE?<br />
What are you thinking of when you say &quot;slowed down considerably&quot;, or referring to faster AoE/ST transitions? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466098340384362496))<br />
I think you solved ST well in 5.2 with the PS change. Just feel that WoD's slowed down style won't mesh well with this AoE.<br />
How long you need to prepare for only relates to rune regen speed, which I don't recall any changes to, offhand. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466100195973799936))<br />
<br />
I'm almost to the point where I think you should just make all runes into permanent Death Runes. And then go from there.<br />
A very fair criticism of Death Knights would be that their resource system is overly complex. No changes currently planned tho. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466141102500626432))<br />

Treants. Underperforming for Resto? Any plans to tweak? They so pretty...<br />
Tuning pass hasn't happened yet. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466010036431376385))<br />

Please if hydras Will become tameable in Wod can you make them normal instead of exotic? I really want one on My twink. Ty<br />
They are non-exotic for the moment (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/465999518828224512))<br />
My apologies if this has been asked but what will the new Hunter Bear Trap do exactly? Bleed/snare, I'd imagine?<br />
Very large bleed + Root. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466098416750047232))<br />
By very large does it means we want it in our rotation?<br />
&quot;Rotational&quot; usually refers to something that's part of your rotation; this is more of a DPS cooldown. Like Stampede or Shadowfiend. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466140562282663936))<br />
Yes. Sorry I missed some tweets. Can you tell us if Lone Wolf is planned to be a DPS increase (~= to l100 row) or neutral?<br />
It'll be an increase, along with the rest of the row. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466146357791567872))<br />

Frost bomb has cast time the others don't. Why? It's one of the biggest factors of myself never using it.<br />
Needed a drawback for how powerful it was in pvp and the utility it has (status effect) that the others don't (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/465990730066825216))<br />
<br />
Ha, I saw that! Lots of people complained about arcane in cata, but usually they weren't playing it!<br />
For me, this is the epitome of tactical vs strategic. You had to know what boss ability was coming to know when to evo (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/466108331221061632))<br />

Any chance the delay in BrM's Power Guard buff from Tiger Palm will be removed or significantly shortened going into WoD?<br />
Power Guard is gone, actually. It was pointless; it was always up. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465966835288924161))<br />
<br />
are there concerns that chi explosion won't be used by Mythic BrM tanks due to the loss of chi pooling?<br />
Not really. You pool mostly for Purifying, which that still preserves. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466004879475896321))<br />
I'm talking about the ability to pool chi for timed Guard uptimes.With CE, the ability to due so is made more difficult,it seems<br />
Right, that's why I said 'mostly'. Guard is the other one you can pool for, but it's much less of the time. Can just pool CE too. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466008909828743168))<br />
But with that I can hold 2 chi and with ascension, us the other 3 chi for blackout kick/Purify. With CE, it seems more about...<br />
But how long/often are you going to do that? You never need to time Blackout Kicks, just Purifies. So it's just Purify vs Guard... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466009780536868864))<br />
...in competition. With Chi Explosion, it's Chi Explosion vs Guard. A little harder, but not much. Besides, you still have Purify. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466009943263281152))<br />
<br />
But can we really plan ahead with CE? We need the Shuffle buff, don't want to cap energy. CE 'll suck out all our Chi.<br />
Shuffle is a natural pool itself; you never pool for BoK/Shuffle. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466024666830602240))<br />
Which may turn mythic tanks off from the talent, due to complexity that essentially can be avoided.<br />
It definitely adds the most complexity of any talent on the row. But that's cool for many players. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466139577506615296))<br />
<br />
How is Soothing Mist going to work fluidly when all efficient Chi builders require you to break the channel constantly?<br />
We may different definitions of 'constantly'. Especially when those efficient Chi builds are great for movement (so couldn't Sooth) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466098846355828736))<br />
Any heal on another target or any chi building will break it. Based on my current knowledge that happens a lot, even now<br />
Surging will be a significant source of your chi generation. Soothing different targets requires swapping, of course. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466101967412936704))<br />
That would require the WoD version of Surging to be mana efficient. Last report indicates that it's not in that category<br />
There's your misunderstanding. It does *not* require Surging to be mana efficient. You absolutely can use some inefficient spells. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466103216556367872))<br />

are you guys looking to make ret more about sustained dmg and less reliant on CDs for dmg and pressure in WoD?<br />
We're looking to do that for *everyone*. Cooldown stacking is a huge problem on live that we want to solve. (Moreso in PvE than PvP) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466102370435215360))<br />
<br />
Seal of Justice doesn't procc if i do a Judgement. Seal of Truth does. Is this Intended?<br />
Yes, so as not to invalidate a talent. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466166601813737472))<br />

35% weapon damage on slam... WTF you just ruined Arms. Slam is our biggest source of damage, slam offsets the lack of crit<br />
Perhaps you should wait until you see the full picture before deciding that a spec is 'ruined'. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465939462715748352))<br />
<br />
Why the priority rotation of CS&gt;MS&gt;OP&gt;Slam is what makes the spec fun, if your just swapping the spell priority then fine.<br />
The goal of the changes we're working on is to simultaneously A) Remove useless complexity, and B) Add gameplay depth. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465955591911776256))<br />
<br />
to be buffed to 200% otherwise, Arms is about hard single hits fury is the small multi hit spec.<br />
There are significant changes to Arms coming, which you don't know about. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465945800208424960))<br />
Can we please get some details? O hope your not changing the rotation or making it RNG dependent like fury<br />
We are changing the rotation. Details will be coming soon. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465947160433811456))<br />
please don't turn it into a button spamfest like fury. Having one or two slower specs in the game is not a bad thing<br />
We're planning to play up the differences between Arms and Fury. Arms should be the 'fewer hits but bigger hits' type. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465955294753734656))<br />
oh no Please not another Warrior pvp expac<br />
And C) Not increase PvP burst. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465956233858408448))<br />
<br />
Character / Items<br />
If gear changes with spec, what happens with gems/chants? We re-gem/re-chant every time we spec swap? Two gear sets seems better..?<br />
Warlords has less gems/enchants. Anyone compelled to have multiple sets of gear will need duplicates in far less slots. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/465649341555048449))<br />
<br />
Are there any plans 2 fix the issue of: Tier Bonus so good I can't swap my NMode gear for HNonTier drops? Hgear rusting=NoFun<br />
That doesn't make gear get DE'd any more than it would anyway. If you're eventually going to use it, keep it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466092987361939457))<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor Stats<br />
So they intend my Boomkin to off spec run with agility gems/chants? Concept is almost good, but not yet.<br />
there will be no primary stat gems or enchants. Secondaries only. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/465889532479430657))<br />
<br />
Cataclysm PvE<br />
Cata dungeons at release were some of the only fun dungeons I played. You can disagree, but I liked the difficulty.<br />
So did many people. But for entry-level content with few alternatives at the time, it was a problem. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/465871248183291904))<br />
<br />
Raids weren't over-tuned (in Cata), period. Half my raid was &quot;below average&quot; and were knocking out bosses steadily. If they could do it ..<br />
Then you're misperceiving what &quot;average&quot; is; I assure you, if you were clearing 4.0 raids steadily, your group was above average. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/465873187797213184))<br />
<br />
Mist of Pandaria PvE<br />
Any plans to get rid of debuffs remaining on MC'd targets after player regains control in Garrosh fight? i.e. Slows @Celestalon<br />
No, that's part of the intended challenge of mind controls. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466139728874446848))<br />
<br />
Empowered adds on Flex need less HP. Normal-geared grps ignore entirely, burn Garry thru P3. Not a viable strat for 540 ilvl ppl<br />
Reducing add health is double-edged; makes it easier for them to accidentally die before being split, which is worse. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/465869923097796608))<br />
<br />
This is in response to new MMOC number showing lower % of people who do Flex have killed Garry than normal groups.<br />
Different populations; Flex encompasses a much wider audience. In any case, we did make some Flex Garrosh adjustments last week. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/465870042253766657))<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor PvE<br />
Any chance that &quot;invite group&quot; would be a thing? Like.. Group merging? Pugging with my SO is.. troublesome <br />
You'll be able to register in Group Finder as a party. So you could list yourselves together and would be invited together. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/466257422298783744))<br />
<br />
What about people who want raid exp and insane ilvl? That's the main problem with joining a pug.<br />
Group leaders are free to ask for whatever they want. But reasonable ones will have a much easier time finding people. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/466303994705367040))<br />
<br />
hows that going to work for LFR, bosses just wont spawn that arent in your wing?<br />
That's how we've done it before. Close some doors, open others, etc. Like Downfall, where door to Spoils is locked. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/465872231495921665))<br />
<br />
No tier gear for LFR is a great incentive to make casuals go flex/normal. But if we cannot find raids now - how will we in #WOD?<br />
Our new Group Finder tool will assist with just that question. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/465938923395371008))<br />
<br />
PersLoot gear in Normal/Heroic/Mythic be trade-able? Ex: 2 hunters, 1 gets bow it doesn't need.<br />
No, personal loot and tradeable are two concepts that don't/can't mix; it would open the door to all kinds of abuse. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/466041583528198144))<br />
<br />
Can you expound on why Mythic can't be loot locked? I want to be in a mythic guild but still progress with more casual friends.<br />
Flexible lockouts allow for split main/alt raids to funnel loot to mains, while keeping the ability to unify for progression (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/466306814661767168))<br />
Basically, much higher likelihood for abuse in Mythic, compared with lower demand for flexibility for the &quot;right&quot; reasons. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/466307089610969088))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Why in the world would a Mythic raider be high-lvl pvp rdy? Will a 2200 pvp'er be Mythic rdy? Apples/Oranges...<br />
Misinterpreting this. Mythic raider won't need gear from honor but will definitely need gear from conquest. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/465653072232865792))<br />
<br />
Doesn't that have &quot;abusive&quot; potential with bringing 40 man raids to stomp the other faction?<br />
It does. We have to weigh the edge case of large groups against the more common &quot;I want to play with my friend&quot; case (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/465672207231123456))<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
Then why are the garrisons always themed human/orc? Not a very great look for any of the Elven races.<br />
Some buildings have influences, peons are from SW tho, know how to work stone. Cool idea for future content. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/465751878748631041))<br />

Computers - Setup of the Month<br />
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
The current SSD prices (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/may/ssdgraph.gif) are stable, with all SSDs under $1 per gigabyte when on sale. <br />
<br />
The Haswell refresh is here for non-overclockable CPUs, with the overclockable versions likely coming in the next few months. These may offer somewhat better overclocking performance, which may worth waiting for if you are overclocking to the limits of air cooling.<br />
<br />
The Haswell CPUs (http://www.anandtech.com/show/7003/the-haswell-review-intel-core-i74770k-i54560k-tested/1) run a little bit on the warmer side. Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VKVZ1A?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002VKVZ1A). <br />
<br />
Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 4770K and should spend that money elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date.<br />

Why should I have to go to a third party to figure out a fight? Kind of takes out the immersion of the game, as opposed to a journal in game of information that &quot;previous adventurers&quot; have compiled easily to read.</div></div><hr />

Exactly, have always hated other players that say, &quot;go watch the fight on YouTube&quot;. Fuck that, I wanna play the game and learn the fight on my own, not by watching others do it!<br />
<br />
Maybe after several attempts and fails I'd consider it, but at least I tried to figure it out first!</div></div><hr />

I seriously wonder what the UI guys do all day... Blizzard usually is slow, but is the UI team working on a raid tier (which I am totally willing to ditch for better UI options)?<br />
Seeing what addons can do, you would think they hurry to copycat a few things more, that could really benefit everyone.</div></div><hr />

some people are lazy, we all know that,<br />
and now when someone asks ''taktzzz plzzz'' he can read them up in like a few sec just before the pull. (speaking for lfr, cmon, we've all been there and seen that....and our alts cry each and every single time we have to deal with it)</div></div><hr />

You are posting on a third party website. I think most of us fail to realize how small of a minority we are. I was doing a heroic dungeon a couple months ago, and I said something like ´check it on wowhead´.. and none of the 4 people with me even knew what wowhead was... this whole belief that ´well, we can just watch the fight on youtube, or read about it on icy-veins´.. is very very wrong when you are talking about the vast majority of players. Especially now that the devs are pushing people up from LFR into Flex.<br />

<br />
They really can´t just add every good add-on because it would increase the CPU demands of the default client. They probably do a very thorough cost analysis before adding stuff to the game, which is one of the big reasons we don´t have DPS meters as part of the default UI. It would negatively impact a lot of players performance. I don´t think it is as a question of their time to implement as much as it is just them wanting to keep the default client as small as possible.</div></div><hr />

I really like seeing the improvement on the dungeon journal. Now we won't have to deal with tanks not knowing the fight. We can simply give them a few minutes to read the journal to find out what they're supposed to do. Hopefully the description doesn't leave something else (like tank swapping). I know some below average players that need things spelled out perfectly in order to do decently.<br />
<br />
I'm glad they clarified the role gems and enchants will play. I was wondering what hybrids were going to do when they swap specs in regards to gems. It would be silly to be an Elemental Shaman and have agility gems if they switched over from Enhancement. Now I'm just curious what items won't swap (e.g. trinkets, weapons?).</div></div><hr />

You would clearly be surprised by the numble of people that raid who can't be bothered to google a fight before stepping in there. In-game should help a bit with those people....<br />

I am sure you are the exception to the &quot;unskilled, bash my head on the keyboard a few more times till I figure out the fight crowd&quot;, but the make attempts to learn the fight crowd are generally people I don't want to waste my time with....</div></div><hr />

Rather ignorant there.<br />
The problems in LFR are primarily the people who should not be there.<br />
Those who want to cruise through because they don't appreciate having to do it in additoin to another format.<br />
Which ofc they do by choice.<br />
Yet we suffer the consequences from ignorant people like that.<br />
<br />
The afk'ers are primarily those who could perform but opt not to.<br />
<br />
If someone is under performing due to inexperience, then how do you think they will get any better with a downright toxic environment which you are only contributing to.</div></div><hr />
