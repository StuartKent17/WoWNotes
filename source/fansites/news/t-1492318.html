<br />
Hey there everyone, I’m Steve Aguilar, lead animator for the World of Warcraft animation team. Today we’re showing off the male Tauren, and with some help from the rest of the animation team, we’re going to give you a look at the animation processes we use to bring this big guy to life. <br />
<br />
Before we even started animating him, we already knew the Tauren was going to be a blast to work on based on all of the detail the character art team added.<br />
<br />
As we begin applying animations, we’re extra careful not to stray too far from the original. It’s important to us to retain the essence of the original animations, because how a characters walk, move, and carry themselves help to define their personality. We use all of the original animations as a starting point, and then go through the process of cleaning them up and adding additional articulation. Let’s delve into what that process looks like.<br />
<br />
The Re-Animator (Steve Aguilar)<br />
The normal “stand” animation is one of the most important animations because this is what you, the player, see the majority of the time. When you stop moving or walk up to an NPC, the stand is the key pose that is being used. A huge chunk of animations also rely on this pose so they can easily transition into and out of it.<br />
<br />
When we import the original stand animation onto the new model, we then look to see if there are any weight shifts, odd rotations, or hitches that we need to fix. After we’ve cleaned up the pose, it goes through another sanity check to see if other animations will still be able to transition into and out of this new stand pose. If we happen to change the pose too much, it can cause a domino effect and possibly harm all the existing animations.<br />
<br />
After touching up the pose, we move on to re-animating the standard idle motion. Slight changes on how muscles move, limbs are carried, or feet hit the ground can get across a better sense of weight for whatever creature it is we’re animating. Tweaking the male Tauren was a lot of fun because we were able to add a lot more weight than the previous model had and make the Tauren feel bigger and beefier. Another thing that stood out was the lack of motion on the nose ring, braids, and especially the face. With the addition of a facial rig, we were able to get his brows, nostrils, ears, and cheeks to react with his breathing motion. Getting these subtle motions to work added so much to the simple standing pose, I imagined the Tauren looking up at me and saying &quot;thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Here’s a side-by-side comparison of the old and new models.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/h_sRrI7SOwA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
Next up is Kevin to talk about the face rig and what that process entails.<br />
<br />
<br />
Face Off (Kevin “Snap ‘n’ Point” Rucker)<br />
Since the facial animation system worked so well with the Pandaren in Mists of Pandaria, with the updated models we wanted to add the same life and emotion they deserved. In the past the character models only had a jaw bone that could be animated, but now we’re able to add movement to the brows, eyes, cheeks and mouth. We’re able to properly make them smile, look angry, and talk.<br />
<br />
We start with a base mesh and add joints to specific spots that will allow us to mold the face. We then add influence, or “skin” the mesh to those joints and shape them into poses: jaw open, eyebrows down or furrowed, for example. We hook up those poses to main controls to make the process of animating the face faster and more cohesive between several animators. For instance, instead of having to move 9 individual joints to shape the eyebrows, we just need to touch 2 controls which include a sub-set of attributes for more detailed shaping. After that if we still need to tweak the poses, we can always go back to the original sub controls for additive fine tuning.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/spPFNwK8Sb4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
We also create a “face file” with several preset expressions the animators can use while working. It’s a lot faster than creating a new pose from scratch. If they need a sad or angry face, they can start from the preset ones, and then adjust from there to make it more unique.<br />
<br />
We also create several mouth shapes, or phonemes, for use in talking animations. Again, posing the face is time consuming, so having a jump start is extremely helpful. It also makes the character feel like it was animated by one person, when there’s actually a big group of us working on them at one time.<br />
<br />

<br />
Body Movin’ (Jeremy “Goonies never say die” Collins)<br />
On a certain level, how you move in the game is one of the most important things you experience as a player. It’s your main interaction with the world around you. For Warlords of Draenor, we wanted to improve the locomotion of WoW’s player characters with brand new rigs. These new rigs are capable of doing so much more in terms of fidelity of motion for our characters, and we wanted to showcase that as much as possible.DwarfMale_Run.jpg <br />
<br />
Everyone who plays WoW is familiar with their character’s idle and run animations—those are the two you see the most. We wanted to really take a look at what made the old player model animations successful, and what made them so iconic. Our job was to then retain the spirit of the old animations, but clean them up so they would look epic on the new rigs. That proved to be a really fun task. Part of the joy of cleaning up an animation like the Dwarf male’s run is going back and seeing what the original animators were thinking about when they first worked on these characters. Some of these runs and walks were animated over 10 years ago!<br />
<br />
The first thing we did when we cleaned up an animation was ask ourselves a series of questions. What are some of the areas that could use touching up? Does the center of gravity on the character feel skewed? Is the character leaning appropriately when moving in a direction? How can we shift the timing to give this animation a greater sense of weight?<br />
<br />
All of our rigs are manipulated with the use of controllers. Controllers are curves that drive the joints the tech artists have placed that ultimately deform deform the model you see. When we open an older animation, we’re manipulating what is called &quot;baked data.&quot; Baked animations have keys on every attribute on every frame. In some cases, it’s necessary for us to delete some keys to make the animation curves easier to manipulate. Here’s what we see inside of Maya. Every one of those colored curves represents rotation or translation of that foot controller.<br />
<br />
Once we had identified what needed polishing we went straight into Maya and got to work. A popular method of cleaning up locomotion animations would be saving the contact poses, major breakdowns, deleting the in-betweens, and smoothing out the motion from there.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/ptc7GnkYoWA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
Emotes were also super fun to work on. We would often times shoot video footage of ourselves acting out emote animations for reference—and no you don’t get to see them. We’d then use that reference as a jumping off point for setting key frames in Maya.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/gl2YQ4vUl3c&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Glass Case of Emotion: Part I (Carman“Boba Muscles” Cheung)<br />
For the majority of the character cleanup phase, the team focuses on three main things: cloth, hair and the face. Cloth includes a front and back tabard and a cape. Hair can be anything from a back ponytail, a front ponytail, pig tails, beards of varying sizes and shapes, or a combination of all of these. We also add facial animation, which adds a lot of character and life to the model. Occasionally, we will also fix minor posing issues or any errors, like jittering.<br />
<br />
<br />
All of our character animations are hand keyed, and not dynamically simulated within the game engine or created through motion capture. This allows us to have complete control in shaping the movement and style for each character, and it adds a unique life to the characters you can’t really get any other way.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/43FPKPN9e0c&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Glass Case of Emotion: Part II (David “Coffee Corn” Edwards)<br />
My favorite part of the entire process is adding the facial expressions, or fixing up the timing or posing of a character. It is astounding how adding a simple facial expression can instantly bring a character to life. It’s always incredibly rewarding to take an old animation and see what even small changes can do to vastly improve it.<br />
<br />
As a contrast, the most difficult part of the process, at least for me, is having to hold myself back from wanting to fix or adjust every little thing for every single animation. Due to the sheer volume of animations that exist for player characters, our goal of having updated models in time for Warlords of Draenor, and the need to animate all the new creatures and objects going into the expansion, we have to prioritize our time. We’ve broken the cleanup passes on character revamp animations up into phases. Phase 1 has all of the locomotion animations (walk, run, etc.) as well as all the emotes and spell casts. Phase 2 deals with the combat animations (attacks, stuns, etc.), and phase 3 is a catch-all for the remaining animations (swimming, fishing, etc.). Regardless of the phase, every animation is touched in some form or fashion, but phase 1 gets the most love since those are the animations are seen the most.<br />
<br />
At the start of each animation we always focus on cleaning up the body first, since this motion drives all of the secondary animation. Below is a video showing the finished product after it has gone through the cleanup process.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
That’s All For Now (Steve Aguilar)<br />
Thanks for reading and letting the animation team share this part of their process with you. I hope we’re doing justice to one of your beloved characters, and that you can see the amount of love we’re applying to not only the male Tauren, but the animations for all of the characters in the game. Have a great day, and you stay classy WoW players!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also love the depth they went into with this Artcraft, I hope we see more like this in future. Not just for the player characters, but maybe show off some big lore characters design process in future, maybe a new raid boss each major patch that ties in to the story and just go into how they kept old characters and updated them for the current tech and how they integrate the Iron Horde element across the different tribes.</div></div><hr />

Exactly this, animating a character by hand is iterating and iterating over and over again trying to make everything flow nice, have the proper weight, timing and force.</div></div><hr />

<br />
probably the reason models are shown without armor or especially without a helm on. Once you put a helm and full armor on you'll notice very little changes besides casting animations and running maybe. Look at the asian beta footage videos you can see orcs full armor with helm not notice much change.</div></div><hr />

Sure.. go tell me my pandaren with the same armor as a troll looks as good as the other.<br />

The skin won't matter much due to armor (although NPCs don't all wear armor), but the animations, it's just a major improvement.</div></div><hr />

The face and mimic looks like Tauren was a comedy relief from any Disney movie ever made, the walk animation seems to beg for a guy playing a tuba theme on each step and the model overall feels, well, just goofy. Not what I've expected a fierce, proud warrior to look like.<br />
<br />
Tauren aren't supposed to look like a fierce warrior, they are calm and peaceful.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, because only one race can be strong. Living for years as a nomadic tribes and having to fight Centaurs and Quilboars every day for supplies and water makes me immidiately think about Pluto face. How are they not fierce and proud warriors?</div></div><hr />

However, seeing him animated changed my opinion completely. They've done an awesome job with this, and I am now extremely excited for Tauren aswell. Definitely plan on re-leveling my druid once WoD hits!<br />

<br />
Because they're not billed to be proud and fierce warriors. They never have been. They're a race of nomadic bovines who seek only to live in peace in a place that they can call home. There are many warriors in tauren society, yes, but saying that their entire race are is far fetched.</div></div><hr />

Look at how much work it takes to create ONE facial expression and animate something &quot;simple&quot; such as running animation. This is a labor of love and you can tell by the results so far. I'm impressed and I can't wait for my tauren shammy to channel those spells.<br />
<br />
I took animation in college I know how much work it is, and this is not just one person it is a small team. I may have to make my paladin a Tauren depending how the new BE look.</div></div><hr />

For all the people saying this looks to over the top, remember that they are showing the extreme animations. most of the time, this character will just be displaying a expressionless or combat face. Not laughing like a loon.</div></div><hr />

Which is....actually a good thing. Tauren, by nature, aren't savages. They are actually quite peaceful. I'd go so far as to say of all the Horde races they are the MOST peaceful despite being big and intimidating.<br />

New style is more how I envisioned they would look after playing WC3 way back when.</div></div><hr />

Some of you are so dense. Seriously.<br />

Too Disney.... really man? You understand that the emotes need to be over the top right like people not always are zoomed in all the way! And nothing wrong with Disney there is a reason people love the life in the characters and frozen won the Oscar! Like the people believed in the characters!

And running animation looks a little strange to me as well as some of his expressions. But I love the casting animations.<br />
<br />
But my issues are with the model. I don't like the wooden looking horns, Bull horns don't look like that, they're smoother! And his whole model has like a plastic-y look now, like I'm looking at an action figure. Also, the hair looks too clean and straight now, like he just got out of the salon. I feel the same way about the Dwarf males' hair, used to look straggly and rugged, now it looks like they just cleaned it and brushed it thoroughly at all times.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mellrod</div><div class="date">2014-04-07, 08:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure what people are talking about when they say he's too &quot;disney&quot;. If they are saying the eyes look too &quot;cute&quot; then they don't really, he still looks ferocious or serious depending on his face expression so his eyes don't ruin the character at all, that's just nitpicking. Although this is all subjective, if they hate it that much then i there WILL be an option in graphics section to use classic model. That way you can have an awkward, puppet-mouthed, N64 Tauren with whites for eyes instead of a tauren with amazing detail in it's eyes.<br />
<br />
I love it atleast! You can def tell how beefy and hefty he feels in his movements such as the laughing or walking animation and his lumbering movements definitely compliment that. I think it's perfect. This is only one customization for the male tauren and there are tons of other faces, eyes, skin, etc to choose from so i doubt he will look too &quot;cartoony&quot; (even though that's been all of WoW's artstyle since Warcraft III...). Although I do agree that they need to have a face option with wrinkles under the yes to make them look aged and tempered with wisdom like alot of the Tauren people are.<br />
<br />
Anyways - it's perfect. Just like all the others! I can't wait to make a tauren warrior when these models come out! now let's hope the next one is Night Elf male or Human male please! :D</div></div><hr />

Or may it's just the fact that the tauren now looks like something from Dreamworks. You know. That (https://images.encyclopediadramatica.es/2/2f/Pixar-dreamworks.gif) face.<br />
Mind = blown. I thought something was off about that face, and now I know why.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I think you're confusing the tauren for orcs.<br />
<br />
Tauren aren't supposed to look like a fierce warrior, they are calm and peaceful.<br />
<br />
Because they're not billed to be proud and fierce warriors. They never have been. They're a race of nomadic bovines who seek only to live in peace in a place that they can call home. There are many warriors in tauren society, yes, but saying that their entire race are is far fetched.<br />
<br />
Before Cairne and the tribes that followed him crossed paths with Thrall's group, they were very much nomadic and were trying to reach their &quot;promised land&quot; (aka Mulgore) so they could be safe from both quilboar and centaur marauders. Once they reached Mulgore and things had settled in, they had an actual homeland. So while some individuals and tribes (Grimtotem) are still nomadic, the race in general lives in settled areas.<br />
<br />
That's not to say that there are no problems with their age-old enemies, however. Tauren still have to protect themselves, so how do you do that? You take a weapon and smash your enemy's face in (or use some form of magic to accomplish the same outcome). So while the tauren race is largely peaceful and friendly, it does not mutually exclude being fierce when called for.<br />
<br />
Additionally, one's race doesn't always reflect the individual's persona. Keep that in mind.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
First model I don't really like. Reminds me of Sully from Monsters Inc.; big, fluffy and not very scary/intimidating at all.<br />
That's generally my feeling on it as well, but I'm hopeful that perception will change once we get to see more of it in action.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
tauren, tauren, tauren, tauren, tauren, DWARF, tauren, tauren..... What's with the random nude dwarf in the images :S<br />
I had to pause when I saw that lonely dwarf image in the mix, but reading the blog cleared up the confusion.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Is it just me or does it bother anyone that the Tauren's head are on their chest and not on top pf their shoulders. With the old model I though they were just hunched over but the new models show it better that their head in on their chest. Could be just me though.<br />
I always thought that their heads were somewhat more &quot;forward&quot; than the other humanoid races, but still... You can really tell the difference between the old and new models.</div></div><hr />

The animations are an improvement. But when we compare this Pixar character to something like the Taunka or Yangol or whatever, it's kind of difficult to have that much appreciation for the model.<br />
<br />
I feel like for a majority of these, they stayed far too close to the original design. I'm sure some people prefer that, but hopefully by their 20th anniversary they will get around to sub-races, not that it will matter for me by then. <br />
<br />
Would have been nice if they provided two completely different models, one that actually looks intimidating and then the Disney/Pixar children's movie characters that look like the old models with more animations. Just feel they could look a little cooler if they weren't bound to changing as little as possible.<br />
<br />
Especially when you think about the fact that you're not zoomed into your characters face for a majority of the game and most people wear helmets. There goes how many hours worth of animation ignored and pointless? And the rest you certainly won't see with gear on and will get old quickly. I feel like changing the overall silhouette of the characters could have made a larger impact. Upgrading the appearance, creating more animations, and adding more shading just won't be noticed that long.<br />
<br />
At the very least, perhaps if they had focused more on providing other kinds of customization, like adjusting height, weight, and giving more hair and horn styles with these updates THEN they would hold value longer. But nope.<br />
<br />
Still hoping for good Draenei, Night Elf, and Blood Elf. But not holding my breath on anything but old models with animated faces and more muscle definition despite how much I'd love to have Draenei males and females with longer tails and way more horn selections.</div></div><hr />

And yeah people calm down about the whole 'not mean enough' argument, Tauren are actually more or less a peaceful people but like any person have the ability to be savage by their own nature and not defined by race. So, stop being racists, I'm sure there will be calm faces and more angry faces, as each race in game pretty much has that if you look.</div></div><hr />

WoW used to be edgy and geared toward the older nerd but its looking more and more like its going for the 12 and under audience with all these friendly happy character appearances.

If that's what you think then you have ZERO idea what the Horde is even about. The tauren are a race of peaceful nomads. Not blood-thirsty mongrels. And the horde isn't just some faction made up of 'fearsome warriors'.</div></div><hr />

I think this goes too far. Tauren were always understated, quiet but strong, never wordy... all my conceptions and familiarity go out the window when I see something that looks like it just walked out of a Shrek movie simultaneously moving 11 different parts of the face while saying two words. I mean when was the last time the art team listened to a Tauren (male) speaking? They sound like they're talking out of the side of their mouth, reluctantly, not like they're enunciating and wiggling their eyebrows while darting their head left and right faster than a being of that size comfortably could (without pulling a muscle in the neck). It was absolutely possible to update the look without changing the character, but this... thing just looks alien.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Scars or body paint/tattoos, to go with broken horn. I'm sure some of the other color variations will look more menacing than brown though.<br />
<br />
2. Smoke/breath coming out of the nostrils at certain times, like cold zones and when enraged/angry, maybe even a reddening of the eyes. Cartoon bull like but not over the top.<br />

I was actually very impressed when I saw how the cloak drapes over the shoulders, under the mane hair, and ends with the circles closer to the collar bone. That's a nice addition. The animated faces were impressive, too.<br />
<br />
I agree with the changes they intend to make, such as bending those fingers inward more, knee position, etc. <br />
My only, only &quot;complaint&quot; is that I feel like the neck hump is too exaggerated compared to the original. If you look at it in the side-by-side rotating videos, it's actually taller and more camel-like angled... the original was a nice rounded slope.</div></div><hr />

I like them, they are a huge improvement. Although I would have liked something a little closer to the Yaungol, they did say they were staying true to the original models do fair play to them.

<br />
Exactly what I think aswell! It looks better, but it doesn't capture the same feeling of the old model. <br />
<br />
It's probably the only remodel so far that I've had a problem with, as the lighthearted (perhaps goofy) look fits quite good on the previously showcased models. But for the tauren? If it wasn't for the stature, you wouldn't think the Taunka and Yaungol had any close relation to Taurens at all. Perhaps only in the most superficial ways.</div></div><hr />

WoW used to be edgy and geared toward the older nerd but its looking more and more like its going for the 12 and under audience with all these friendly happy character appearances. Blizz does a great job with the artwork. Now that they chased away it core audience though and we all have families now they want to get our kids playing or something. Hopefully whatever replaces the dead &quot;Titan&quot; project is geared toward grown ups.<br />
<br />
When was WoW, or Wacraft as a franchise EVER edgy? It has always been filled with jokes, bright colors and other assorted non-edgy things. Sure they can tell some mature stories with in that or have some darker themes, but it has always been this way. <br />
<br />
But I guess people will always think this. Even back in 2003 people were saying that WoW was too cartoony and casual friendly. Oh well, keep it up Blizz.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is actually something I noticed myself aswell, and I don't actually play tauren(just tried them).<br />
<br />
I have always viewed them as very calm, down to earth/relaxed when it comes to their animation. The new animation makes them feel more loud-mouthed the way I see it.<br />
<br />
It does look very good, but yeah, they lost some of their original personality. My first thought when I saw their laugh animation for example, was gnome and dwarf. That's not really races I have previously seen any similarity to.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I think the expressions here are drastic in some cases. No, they're not as bad as you think.<br />
<br />
Let's be real -- they're animating something with a muzzle. That always introduces challenges with expressiveness and, heck, even forming word-sounds. I think they did a fantastic job.<br />
<br />
Let's also not forget that many of the new races they're showing all have exaggerated expressions. They're doing it because they can. WoW isn't entirely serious-face all the time, right? And, yes, Tauren are generally subtle and placid and all that -- as a species. As individuals, they can be anything they want to be. We've had YEARS now where Tauren have been leaving Mulgore to go out into the world. Ever since they joined the Horde, they've been exposed to the conflicts and cultures in the world at large. That's going to strip out some of that Ent-ish &quot;ho hum, let's not be hasty&quot; way of thinking, especially from the younger Tauren.<br />
<br />
You honestly can't look at the &quot;belly laugh&quot; Tauren and the angry-rar-face Tauren and say &quot;these look horrible.&quot; They're leagues above what we have now. They're awesome.</div></div><hr />

But seriously, I commend the animation quality, but I fear it's been misplaced. The animators did a great job from a quality perspective on both the body and facial animation. However, the exaggerated animations (especially facial) do break away from the original look and feel of the race, hence it goes against what they promised. While Tauren are suppose to be a peaceful race, lets not forget they're muscular giants towering over other races. This is race who has endured the hardships of nomad life, always struggling and battling both nature and their enemies for survival of their race. They're not suppose to be cute. The voices and gestures of current models suggest calm and wise people, but ones you wouldn't want to mess with. The new model and animations scream Shrek!</div></div><hr />

They are 100% true to the original and now finally our characters won't be ugly as fuck while the world around them is beautiful. Deal with it. Great job Blizz.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The shape of the nose is all wrong, the new model has huge goofy eyebrows, and those big rubber lips. Also the coloration has no darker/lighter areas, it's all just one flat color. Let's not even mention the disgusting pink fingers.<br />
<br />
Who are you to say what Tauren should or should not be like,is it your game? No. Is it your idea? No. Is it your concept of what the Tauren look like? No. So shut the fuck up you self entitled moron.<br />
<br />
The only thing i thought was wrong with the models is the back view looks abit like a gorilla model,but apart from that i was just amazed we didnt see the Taurens BULLOCKS when his loin cloth got abit windy!</div></div><hr />

Mostly because people that enjoy WoW don't need it to become &quot;darker&quot; to keep enjoying it.<br />
<br />
Usually only 15-16yr olds complain about things not being dark enough for them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PErsonally i love new model. Considering race changing from orc. Gotta wait for trolls and other races first though.</div></div><hr />

Haven't even touched upon modeling since high school... certainly never even looked into animating but this looks like a hell of a lot more fun than I'd ever imagined.</div></div><hr />

I really love the work Blizzard did on new Tauren character. <br />
However I'm a bit worried how gear will look on it. Neck seems to be quite long and my favourite hemlet doesn't look too good on it.<br />
