Update (Talent Calculator) : For people who REALLY want to play with talents, our internal Talent Calculator (http://www.mmo-champion.com/talent/) is now available. Keep in mind that it's not really supposed to be public and there are probably a bunch of bugs here, but it should be working for most of you. (Note to IE6 users : Get Firefox) <br />
<br />
It seems that some of the fansites part of the official fansite program were allowed (http://www.worldofraids.com/forums/showthread.php?t=17115) to posts all the info from the skills and talents of the Death Knight gathered during the Worldwide Invitational. I guess that's the time to officially start the WotLK preview here and we'll start with the skills and talents of all the classes except for the Hunter and Paladins (not available yet) <br />
<br />
More to come depending on ... how it goes. (We all know what it means)<br />
<br />
Disclaimer<br />
This is ALPHA stuff, it can and most likely will be changed and a lot of things will be modified before Wrath of the Lich King is released. This is only a preview of the final game but doesn't reflect the balance between classes at the release. Also note that any post with screenshots of the alpha will be moderated, the old &quot;no WotLK stuff&quot; rule still applies. <br />

<br />
the 200 yards is a tooltip typo. There is many of them in any alpha/beta. Compagny use them to see if the tester are actualy checking for this kind of stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
um...with 20 sec silence, affil speci looks to me like &quot;THE&quot; anti-caster class in wow. i don't see too much use of that talent in pve though but just imagine in arena, if cripple can't be dispelled, you can pretty much lock down any caster in a 2vs2 team. Warrior/Druid, Rogue/Disc Priest will be a joke.</div></div><hr />

The duration of all Stun and Fear effects used against you is reduced by 20%, and your mounted speed is increased by 20%. This does not stack with other movement speed increasing effects.<br />
<br />
Grats on getting rid of another unique paladin skill/talent. They had better have some damn good talents lined up for us with all the shit incoming for other classes.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nimrod</div><div class="date">2008-07-09, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wee looks like they are trying to fix execute, making it usefull again..<br />
<br />
If you take a fast look at the dmg outputs and how they are increasing pretbc and tbc and THEN looking at WoTLK. You'll see a significant change.<br />
<br />
Execute<br />
Rank 5 56 Attempt to finish off a wounded foe, causing 600 damage and converting each extra point of rage into 15 additional damage. Only usable on enemies that have less than 20% health.<br />
+150<br />
+3<br />
Execute<br />
Rank 6 65 Attempt to finish off a wounded foe, causing 750 damage and converting each extra point of rage into 18 additional damage. Only usable on enemies that have less than 20% health.<br />
Instant, 15 Rage, 5 yd range<br />
+175<br />
+3<br />
Execute<br />
Rank 7 70 Attempt to finish off a wounded foe, causing 925 damage and converting each extra point of rage into 21 additional damage. Only usable on enemies that have less than 20% health.<br />
Instant, 15 Rage, 5 yd range<br />
<br />
Now in WoTLK!<br />
<br />
+390<br />
+7<br />
Execute<br />
Rank 8 73 Attempt to finish off a wounded foe, causing 1315 damage and converting each extra point of rage into 30 additional damage. Only usable on enemies that have less than 20% health.<br />
Instant, 15 Rage, 5 yd range<br />
<br />
+350<br />
+8<br />
Execute<br />
Rank 9 80 Attempt to finish off a wounded foe, causing 1665 damage and converting each extra point of rage into 38 additional damage. Only usable on enemies that have less than 20% health.<br />
Instant, 15 Rage, 5 yd range<br />
<br />
<br />
So as far as I can see the scaling of execute will be improved, after it completely failed in tbc. <br />
<br />
P.S. you can go further back in ranks, but I chosed these ranks.<br />
P.P.S you can see the level after rank number - the level which you learn the ability.<br />

Sudden Death: Your melee critical hits have a 10%/20/30% chance of allowing the use of Execute regardless of the target's health state.</div></div><hr />

Also Arcane barrage has a coefficient of a spell that takes 3 seconds to cast. This makes it higher dps than Arcane blast. With a 51/0/20 build you can use frostbolt/Abar rotation for pve and for pvp you can use Arcane power/ Abar/firebast/Abar/pomfrostbolt/Abar for around 14k damage in 7.5 seconds. ;D Thats even not counting shatter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warlocks don't regen mana while casting, so mana regen from spirit is not good enough. Spell damage? That'd be an interesting one. Crit is rightfully determined by intell. Spirit might effect spell dam, but not crit.<br />
<br />
And Demonic Embrace looks unchanged. So now you have 1 talent reducing your spirit, and another increasing it! Do you still want to agree that blizzard understands the game ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ye I know - but personally ill skip it until I have seen if execute will work better in WoTLK then TBC - because in TBC it is redicoulas - doing 1500-1600 with a full rage bar, and then sometimes you do 6000 or so - its so random, but most of the times its better for you to use mortal strike tbh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&lt;tldr version&gt;<br />
new fire talents suck<br />
new frost talents are 50/50 (maybe 60/40)<br />
new arcane talents are pretty decent<br />
seems like new mage talents are poorly thought out in some cases and don't belong that deep in any tree<br />
&lt;/tldr version&gt;<br />
<br />
ok, /Rant On<br />
<br />
Fiery Payback - Increases damage caused by Molten Armor by 20% and whenever you resist a spell the caster takes 50% of any instant damage that would have been caused. Damage caused by Fiery Payback will not exceed 50% of the caster's health.<br />
<br />
meh, maybe 5 people in all of WoW will take this one seems like it should be a tier 1, maybe tier 2 talent at most.<br />
<br />
World in Flames - If a Fire spell you cast hits 3 or more targets, the spell causes an additional 15% damage.<br />
<br />
again, too little too deep in the tree, are they even trying?<br />
<br />
Living Bomb - The caster becomes a living bomb, causing 51 Fire damage to all enemies within 10 yards every 2 sec sec. After 6 sec, a fiery explosion occurs causing an additional 212 Fire damage to all enemies within 10 yards.<br />
<br />
yay? seems like they are trying to give mages more reason to get really close to stuff, too close, way too close... yeah, I'm guessing the mage designer plays a warrior main and is trying to get revenge for getting kited to death.<br />
<br />
Burnout - Increases your spell critical damage bonus with all Fire spells by 25% but every time you critical with a Fire spell you lose an additional 1% of your total mana.<br />
<br />
wow... seriously, why take this, when with the extra talents from wotl you could spec 32/39/0 http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?talent=of0E00fzxu0bZxg0zfccoeMm or even pull an extra point from emp fireball and pick up AP. get 50% crit damage bonus (to all spells, not just fire) vs. 25%, and no loss of mana that in long fights will leave mages wanding at the end of a fight. Or could go 40/31/0, drop emp fireball but pick up 25% int as spell damage http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?talent=of0E00fzxIziZxg0zfccot<br />
<br />
If they keep these talents for fire, my mage will hit 80 for water and that'll be it.<br />
<br />
/Rant Off<br />
<br />
<br />
Frost tree looks a little better, but not much. Winter's grasp will help make frost mages viable in raids (shatter procs on raid bosses) but deep freeze seems of dubious value, a 1.5 sec cast stun usable only on frozen targets and lasts 5 sec? Assuming you get the stun off, all someone has to do is trinket and you just wasted precious seconds trying to stun someone who you can no longer stun, instead of taking advantage of the shatter combo set up. Only time this seems to have any real use is off of a winter's grasp proc.<br />
<br />
Arcane tree looks promising, Basically pick up a nice arcane fireblast (I hope they dont do what they did with dragons breath and cone of cold and share their timers), Netherwing presence looks really nice, and they seen to be giving talents to convert spirit into crit rating (would have prefered hit rating to be honest).<br />
<br />
All in all I'd give it a 2.5/5 mainly because of how bad the fire talents are and how useless/poorly positioned some of the talents are.<br />
<br />
Any other mages out there wishing they would give us a talent to put a staff in our offhand like those battle mages in Strat Live side?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I seriously hope so. Am I the only one who thinks the Resto tree additions are totally underwhelming? Mana Tide still not trainable. Earth Shield was nerfed, and now they want us to spec talent points into additional charges and it still doesn't even get us to the pre-nerf level?? And it can still be spell-stolen or removed by a rogue. Nature's Guidance still taking up a slot in the Resto tree instead of the Enhancement tree, where it belongs. No improvements to Chain Heal? Really? Tidal Waves appears to have no effect on CH. Spirit Link, Blessing of the Eternals, and Ancestral Awakening are all pretty lackluster talents.<br />
<br />
I think the changes to the Elemental and Enhancement trees are definitely a step in the right direction, but Resto is far behind them, comparatively speaking. Yes, I know it's not complete yet, but so far I'm not optimistic. Tell me what I'm missing here....</div></div><hr />

<br />
51 dmg at level 80? <br />
It's actually 130 damage per person in the area for 3 ticks, followed by a 520 damage explosion at level 80. Don't forget that that will scale with spelldamage and targets in range. It could also be buffed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Seems like the ENHANCEMENT (not enchantment &gt;.&gt;) shamans and Resto shamans abilities aren't fully done - Stay tuned!!!!!<br />
Yeah, I noticed that too, put it in my feedback post to Blizzard a while ago.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Yeah, the lack of Tidal Waves affecting Chain Heal sucks, but look at the big picture. You can Spirit Link 3 players, and then proceed to Chain heal all three, dispersing the damage taken on a tank AND increasing the overall healing done in terms of HPS and HPM. <br />
<br />
When you're not doing that, using Healing wave with the increased 9% increased crit chance will mean that your target will get the healing wave buff, an armor buff, and anybody else in the raid taking damage will be healed. In addition, Earth Shield wasn't really nerfed. Sure, the charges were cut by 4, but the mana cost was halved. Now, for half the cost of a 10 charge ES, you get an 8 charge ES that heals 10% more.<br />
<br />
To top it all off, Blessing of the Eternals gives 4% to crit with all your spells, offensive and defensive. Not only will it improve all your crit based spells, but it'll give you an offensive edge.</div></div><hr />

When activated, your next Mage spell with a casting time less than 10 sec becomes an instant cast spell.<br />
3 min cooldown<br />

As the Talent Calculator itself is a more independent site (I mean, it doesn't even slightly look like it's related to this site apart from the link at the top), I prefered to have it opened in a new window/tab, just the way it is now ;)<br />
<br />
Edit: It's way more userfriendly to open it as a new tab than replacing the current site as it indeed looks like a completely different site, so one would expect it to open in a new tab without even looking at the tabs, therefore when closing that site, one would close down the entire mmo-champion-tab if it replaced it, and would have to re-enter the site instead of always staying on the REAL mmo-champion-site with an &quot;older&quot; tab.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Druid buffs seems good. At least ferals will be a bit more useful in PvP and resto getting a shorter heal will mean druids have every type of spell at there disposal now. Instants, Hots of every description, short sharp heals, long fat heals ... all other healers now obsolete :)<br />

Which in my opinion is VERY sad considering the game was made for PvE.<br />
<br />
The mages get some pretty nice stuff, i think its just not what we expected. Frostfire is very nice, since it'll make elementalist build a little more viable (IMO elementalist is still viable, but im in the minority sadly).<br />
<br />
One of the problems i think mages are suffering from is not having a gimmick talent. We seem to get more practical and ordinary buffs, rather then turning your self into a atomic power chicken and firing laser beams out of your beak.</div></div><hr />

Two of the frost talents are godly. Stop crying about it, seriously, if all these hits live I will consider mages fixed and probably one of the strongest classes out there. And please, don't look at the talents only, search a little around the web, you'll find that some of our current skills gets tweaks and changes, and some of our scaling gets way better as well. (This is from a PvP point of view.)<br />
<br />
The fire talents sucks. What the fuck is Blizzard thinking. But Arcane Barrage can be nice.<br />
<br />
Cripple was removed some time two weeks ago and is currently not in the alpha anymore. Blizzard stated that the talent was way overpowered and they have removed it. Currently Affliction is without a 51 pt talent. Oh, and, it used to share DR with Fear. AND in PvP it'd only have a 10 second duration.<br />
<br />
As far as I can see it deep frost with some talents in either fire or arcane will be the way to go for PvE. :&lt; But that might be a subject of change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dismantle will remove weapons, off-hands, and shields. Whatever you can use in your off-hand (whether it's a shield, weapon, book, or other +stat enhancing item) will be removed as well.<br />
<br />
It will likely also remove ranged weapons such as bows, guns, wands, etc.<br />

<br />
<br />
I have to dissagree. The reason for MF is to assist SW:pain till your mind blast cools.. Chances are if I'm MFing I got SW:pain up. And if I don't want SW:pain up for some boss that has a aggro reset then I'd rather have mind blast available to me to use then not since it would refresh a dot. Not only that but mind flay is more mana efficient and can't always afford to use mind blast if I wanted to take advantage of the tallent.<br />
<br />
Edit: btw if this tallent refreshes a whole new dot then this makes SP much much more mana effecent since SW:pain is a huge mana dump.</div></div><hr />

Improved Stormstrike also reduces the skill's cooldown by 1000 seconds. So, uh... by this logic, Shamans in WotLK will be able to hasslelessly punt gnomes from Orgrimmar and travel back in time.</div></div><hr />

As a PvPing shadow priest I am more than happy with the changes. I havent take a good look at the other classes yet tho.<br />
<br />
Right now my shadowy glow attracts every rogue within vision range.<br />
<br />
Fade is gonna be very, very usefull and right now its the most useless spell u can have for PvP. <br />
The imp. fade talent even more useless, even in PvE.<br />
<br />
Psychic Horror + Fade seems like a good escape option.<br />
I really hope they create level 80 rocket boots. else i'm really gonna miss them.<br />

Warlocks as a whole did not receive much if any true buffs in WoTLK.<br />
<br />
-Their single largest contribution to raid DPS - nerfed.<br />
<br />
-Demonology was the only tree that got any real buffs and that was only because it was the red-headed stepchild of the warlock talent trees. They gave them group synergy and raid viability. But they still will suck mightly on the DPS charts.<br />
<br />
-Demon Form, once you get past the whole &quot;Coolfactor&quot; is a crappy skill. <br />
<br />
a.) The Demon form abilities have their own coefficients and scaling that are subpar. <br />
b.) The SBolt volley is not considered a &quot;True Shadowbolt&quot; and thus gets no benefit from Shadowbolt specific talents. <br />
c.) You lose the ability to use your regular lock abilities (similar to shifting into bearform/catform and not being able to cast spells)<br />
d.) You are treated as a demon. And thus vulnerable to Banish and the now instacastable instarecharge Paladin demon/undead fear.<br />
e.) Lastly, as this is the warlock 51 point demo talent that means you can't pick up ruin in the destro tree making it a weak as hell dps build.<br />
<br />
Mages get frostfire bolt for FREE. And the new Mage Armor changes are crazy powerful and are also FREE.<br />
<br />
a.) Frostfire bolt counts as both a Fire and an Frost Spell (so if you grab talents from both trees)allowing you to get some crazy Ignite-Shatter combo effects in addition to all the talents from both tree that increase fire or cold damage or crit chance that will STACK with each other.<br />
<br />
b.) It does smart damage. Ie: whichever damage type would deal more damage.<br />
<br />
c.) Mage armor (which will also be non dispellable come 2.4.3) granting a 50% reduction to the duration of ALL DETRIMENTAL MAGICAL EFFECTS. Is the single largest buff any spell caster class has ever recieved (and I even rank that above the Shaman totem changes the devs were talking about). It basically gives you a free 50% damage redux pass verses all warlocks. Fear? Curse of tongues? Dots? Seduces? All will only last half of their duration. Now factor in diminishing returns? I don't ever want to hear a mage complain about warlocks in pvp EVER again and I don't even play a lock.<br />
<br />
<br />

PVE wise Mage armor still pales compared to locks - and those got bufffed for raiding. Helps against locks? Couldn't care less - and actually helps against affliction locks. Maybe WotLK will have a few gimmick fights where it is useful. <br />
<br />
IF PVE is hard to figure at this point, PVP is night on impossible, but I'm not seeing much of change. Regarding world PVP there are two mechanics that are OP (mechanics, not classes): stealth and fear. Until they get seriously changed - e.g. fear having a 50% change of aggroing either the feared or the fearing, dmg against you when stealth being 4 times the normal one or putting fade in/fade out time, they will remain OP mechanisms.<br />

<br />
Finally, frostfire bolt has all the markings of a AB - nice blast if you have an underperforming spec, or useful in some very specific situations. It will most likely be inferior to either Frostbolt and fireball if you aren't an elementalist - which probably you won't be. The proposed Fire tree (our raiding tree remember) is generally very unimpressive, with a 51 pointer that is just LMAO.<br />
<br />
Yes, it still is early in game dev, but lets face it - PVE wise mages have been a rather ... well a crappy class since day zero of TBC, and worst of all dev attitude towards - Kalgan in particular - was the equivalent of sleazy politician - and you can't get much worse than that, can you?<br />

<br />
<br />
IMHO Arcane should have been put as a raiding spec long ago. But so far it isn't and &quot;independent&quot; tree - you rely on fire or frost for a good chunk of the damage, and, tbqh, it has been underperforming but for some gear proc based short lived times (how many times was MSD changed FFS?).<br />
<br />
So in the end it has been underpowered and harder to pull off (lack of spell push back protection, mana cost, lack of range, low crits). I have no idea what Blizz had really planned for arcane, but whatever it was, it failed miserably.<br />
<br />
Given the sorry ass deep fire talents, Arcane + frost may very well become the base of mage raiding, although that will depend a lot on - namely - ABr spell coefficient. <br />
<br />
So it is much a &quot;wait and see&quot; approach in logical terms.</div></div><hr />

<br />
mmmh... Not TC arcane (much less WotLK), but for raiding (presuming that is a PVE build - ;)), it has, imho, some &quot;strange choices&quot;. IAM is not that interesting, not to say just quite bad. Should be a 3 pointer at most. But it seems that your tree is skipping on some interesting talents (like arcane impact) for others of extremely doubtful value (arcane fortitude???).<br />
<br />
Thing about AM is that is - and has been - a quite useless spell but for the the brief occasions when gear procs/exploits made it good. The DPS is lower - probably lower than and untalented FB. The DPM isn't all that good either. Being channeled makes it susceptible to interruption. And the mana cost is paid upfront. <br />
<br />
It would be interesting if it could be channeled on the move, even if at half movement speed. There it would find its place.<br />
<br />
So, in the end, the Arcane rotation is basically other school primary nuke between AB rotations. Not sure if ABr (actually, the only half decent 51 ptr of the mage, depending on coefficients) will take the place in the nuke rotation. So far it looks a lot like FireBlast. And whats up with Arcane Impact not affecting it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It is obvious that you don't play a lock. While yes they did nerf ISB by 5%, that isn't gamebreaking in the slightest. It looks like they're moving pve destruction towards a more fire-friendly setting, with eternal flames and backdraft. Also did you miss the buff to cataclysm which adds 5% hit to it? Warlocks have been lacking a true destro hit talent for far too long. Also, Empowered imp is in the wrong talent tree- wolkwiki.info says that it should be in the destruction tree. If you can keep your imp alive that is an insanely good talent. And don't discount the raid damage of Chaos bolt. Remember, you will be able to get 51 point talents at level 60, and the tooltip damage of Chaos bolt is 990-1256 at level 60. To put that in perspective, the tooltip damage of soul fire at level 60 is only 703-881. And that's only at a level 60 rank, and it has a mere 1.5 second cast, and a mere 8 second cooldown vs. a 1 min CD for soul fire.<br />
<br />
Demonform will mainly (only) be used in pvp, because it has little or no usefulness in raiding. I'm not certain what it's greatest function will be but it will at least be useful as a survival talent, bringing your health up to 100% and boosting armor by 360%. In pve however, demonology warlocks will finally be able to have a felguard AND ruin. That along with fel synergy and demonic pact will make demonology raiding much more viable than it currently is.<br />
<br />
Not sure about the affliction tree. Looks like it's gaining synergy with shadowpriests once again, and cripple looks to be OP in pvp, but beyond that I'm undecided.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This guy speaks the truth. Mages got love. I've been playing a mage for three years now and my two main mages together have clocked in about 160 days of played. But, I'm not certain if Frostfire Bolt works the way believed. From what I've heard and read, in an encounter where the Frostfire Bolt deals &quot;smart&quot; damage, only the highest damage will be affected. In other words, if it's a frost resistant boss and the FFB deals fire damage, only the fire talents will affect it. Otherwise FFB will be one of the most insane DPS-increases mages have ever recieved and it'll probably exceed nearly all other DPS classes. I strongly doubt that and I think there's more to how it works regarding talents than we're aware of by now.<br />
<br />
Oh and the Mage Armor will only half the duration of magic effects as it clearly states. It's still strong as fuck, yes, and an insane buff (I will never complain about warlocks again if this goes live!), but Curse of Tongues and Curse of Agony will not be halved, neither will Cyclone. Fear, Corruption, Siphon Life, on the other hand, will. Instead of 10, 5, 2, it'll be 5, 3, 1, I guess. That's pure awesomness. Haha.<br />
<br />
What's interesting though, is how this affects Drain Life and Drain Mana, as they are considered a magic debuff on the casted target, while it's a channeled spell for the warlock.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Awesome. I'll be sure to check out that 0/21/51 build when I hit 81...oh wait. <br />
<br />
Chaos bolt will rarely if ever see the light of day in pve because it's A) not considered a shadow spell so it's not going to gain benefit from [Improved Shadowbolt] [Shadow and Flame] or [Demonic Sacrifice] you know, the mainstays of the current Destro dps build. And soon not even the many new talents in WotLK that will increase the effect of various fire spells either. Not to mention that if you take Chaos bolt you won't even be able to reach Demonic Sacrifice in the Demonology tree.<br />
<br />
<br />
Chaos bolt will only serve one purpose in pvp: Ruining the day of Paladins and CD Rogues everywhere - But only before the desto lock is promply obliterated since the only true defense they will have is the now nerfed SL. There is a reason you only see SL/SL locks and no SL/Destro locks. <br />
<br />
On a sidenote: Hurray for them nerfing ISB procs by 5% and making them no longer affect dots or lasers. Shadowpriests and Afflocks everywhere are shedding tears.<br />
<br />
<br />
PVE wise Mage armor still pales compared to locks - and those got bufffed for raiding. <br />
<br />
Buffed? BUFFED? You mean where they completely removed the +20% (26 if talented - which it always is) healing off of their Fel Armor? <br />
<br />
<br />
Helps against locks? Couldn't care less - and actually helps against affliction locks.<br />
<br />
Because Destro and Demo locks don't use Howl of Terror? Seduce? FEAR?<br />
<br />
<br />
As for your thoughts on frostfire bolt: If you can't see how well this spell benefits from Ignite, Flamethrowing, Burning Soul, Incineration, Improved Scorch, Master of Elements, Critical Mass, Elemental Precision, Frostbite, Ice shards, Permafrost, Icy Veins, Piercing Ice, SHATTER, Frost Channeling, Arctic Reach, Winter's Chill, and Arctic Winds -you should just /delete your mage and go play checkers... or something<br />

<br />
<br />
They gave the healing to demon armor, I assume to distinguish between the pvp armor and the pve armor. Seriously though, if you need the +20% healing in rading as a warlock...you shouldn't be raiding. A minor inconvenience to be sure but nothing major.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You forget a few things. Firstly, full destruction locks cannot currently get soul link anyways. Even if it is a nerfed version it is still far superior to the current dead zero defense they have right now. Sl/destro locks currently cannot get any of the major talents in the top few tiers of the destruction tree while still retaining soul link- that is why you don't see Sl/destro locks.<br />
<br />
While yes Chaos bolt will not receive bonuses from the current mainstays of the destruction tree, you're missing the big picture- a soul fire equivalent every 8 second with a cast time shorter than shadow bolt or incinerate. The lack of DS for Chaos bolt would not be too farfetched for a fire/destro build which would benefit more from talents like backdraft, eternal flames, and molten core.</div></div><hr />

Subject to change? Definately as we are still in the alpha. But that is currently how it works -Benefits from both frost and fire at the same time.<br />
<br />
Confirmed via live client streams, SS from the alpha, Frapses, and from the Class Developers themselves at the WWI (i think they had the streams and screens posted on this site earlier in the week also).<br />
<br />
<br />
will not be halved, neither will Cyclone<br />
<br />
<br />
Cyclone will be halved. It's considered a magic effect and is a target for magical dispells. The problem however is that you go immune so the dispell can't hit you. Mage armor grants the effect passively so Cyclone is currenly reduced.</div></div><hr />

Fire builds still gain benefit from Demoic Sacrifice. Instead of sacrificing the succubus for +15% shadow damage you sacrifice the imp for +15% fire damage.</div></div><hr />

Put it this way: do you really think that FFB will be better than either Frostbolt (for deep frost) or Fireball (for deep fire) for anyone but an elementalist build? And do you really wager that elementalist will be the best raiding spec?<br />

Well, I don't think so. Consider why Blizzard created the FFB. IMO - shared by many, I might say - it is mainly for making immunity fights more excusable. Also it can come handy for farming without the need for respeccing. But logic dictates that the currently existing main nuke will be better for a deep build than the FFB.<br />
<br />
Am I sure? <br />
<br />
OFC not - only when beta comes out we will know a bit better what is the effective Blizzard vision. But I think some ppl are seeing too much into FFB. It is just another nuke, useful for some situations and may be very good for PVP (don't know and don't really care, but those 3s cast time...). Who knows if the elementalist will make a comeback?<br />
<br />
But I doubt. Blizzard has shown no consistent vision of the classe roles and, above all, the (variable) stated vision many times have a strong discrepancy regarding what really goes ingame. Put it down to incompetence or politics :P</div></div><hr />

I've been playing a mage for three years now and my two main mages together have clocked in about 160 days of played. But, I'm not certain if Frostfire Bolt works the way believed. From what I've heard and read, in an encounter where the Frostfire Bolt deals &quot;smart&quot; damage, only the highest damage will be affected. In other words, if it's a frost resistant boss and the FFB deals fire damage, only the fire talents will affect it. Otherwise FFB will be one of the most insane DPS-increases mages have ever recieved and it'll probably exceed nearly all other DPS classes. I strongly doubt that and I think there's more to how it works regarding talents than we're aware of by now.<br />
<br />
Oh and the Mage Armor will only half the duration of magic effects as it clearly states. It's still strong as fuck, yes, and an insane buff (I will never complain about warlocks again if this goes live!), but Curse of Tongues and Curse of Agony will not be halved, neither will Cyclone. Fear, Corruption, Siphon Life, on the other hand, will. Instead of 10, 5, 2, it'll be 5, 3, 1, I guess. That's pure awesomness. Haha.<br />
<br />
What's interesting though, is how this affects Drain Life and Drain Mana, as they are considered a magic debuff on the casted target, while it's a channeled spell for the warlock.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mages in my opinion hardly got love.... I could care less about Frostfire bolt. Why must Mages always be pigeonholed into a certain spec to be viable. I'm sure being elemental is fun and all but I'm more of a Frost spec kind of indiviual. I wish they buffed current spells since locks are getting a teleport they need to fix Blink already and maybe increase the distance you travel without talenting it. I think that would be a good start and add to a mages elusiveness. The buffs to armors should have been implemented from the jump. It's ridiculous you can have all your beneficial buffs dispelled then be wrecked like a newborn fawn. Mage armor halfing the duration of harmful spells is situational at best and does not become the end all be all for which armor you should be using during pvp or pve. Would be nice to have new ways to freeze ppl too sinc eother classes are getting a ton of stuff.</div></div><hr />

and the Mage Armor 50% duration reduction on dots LOL<br />

Blizzard did 1 wish for mages - warlocks won't beat us 100% sure on 80lvl if this goes live,<br />
even more, imagine every resist = ~750 mana for me (if avg mana pools grow from 10000 to 15000)<br />

<br />
100% sure it will be 10-20 yards similar to the new druid knockback they are getting.<br />

<br />
So has anyone else noticed Shaman enhancement Imp Stormstrike says reduces CD by 2000 seconds. I know thats a typo, but is it 20 seconds (lolwut?) or 2 seconds (okay saved 2 talent points)?<br />
<br />
<br />
90% sure it will be CD reduced by 2-4 secs most likely just 2...but the effects OF SS (improved nature damage) were not for Enhancement themselves (except for soloing and the like) but rather Druid/Elemental Shamans to do increased damage.<br />
<br />
Besides that - <br />
1. Enhancement will be a flame shock stacker for Elemental Shamans :P - looks like they're increasing the synergy between two players with two different specs. Rather than between two specs as it is better for Enhancement to still go over to Resto partially and grab the 3% hit. But we will see what else they bring to the table.<br />
2.Good to see that Ancestral Knowledge and the top of the enhancement tree being fixed up &quot;Increases your intellect by 6%.&quot; for 3 points is WAY better than 5% mana for 5 f'ing points.<br />
3. Shield Spec - down to 2 points. YAY this gay talent has no use and was improved even more. (two points to spend with when you have nothing else to get?)<br />
4. Weapon Specialization - interesting talent... they just laid out what weapons we use entirely. (MH Axe - OH Mace or Fist [will fist buff stack with sunder and the like?])</div></div><hr />

<br />
For those that aren't all that interested in warlock ganking (e.g. grow up), the talent tree don't seem to be that good. <br />
<br />
All I really care about WotLK mage is raiding/PVE. And sorry to say, but so far the message from Blizzard has been quite iffy at best. well, at least they finally recognized that locks were a superior version of mages (sort off). <br />
<br />
Granted, arcane shows some promise, but fire is quite appalling. And the &quot;AOE kings&quot; argument is rather poor and not even new.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nevbo</div><div class="date">2008-07-15, 07:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone know if frostfire bolt receives bonus's to all the frost/fire talents? or only the school of damage they are doing at the time?<br />
<br />
Because its a initial fire damage with a snare, so that basicly goes great with shatter but will it receive crit damage from both Ignite and the frost crit talents? If it does that basicly opens up the elementist build to be a heavy damage build.<br />
<br />
It also explains why fire is getting that increased fire dmg from crits lower in the tree.</div></div><hr />

The more i read into them for every class the more obvious it becomes that they were kind of a joke that blizzard released and possibly even intetnionally leaked. There is absolutely no way that talents like cripple, thunder, and metamorphosis are ever going live as is. No way in hell are they going to let one class spell lock someone for 20 seconds.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nevbo</div><div class="date">2008-07-15, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizz is putting in counter measures for Cripple, Almost every pvp spec now has a way to get out of movement impairing effects, or some type of berserk effect.<br />
Tho IMO it does need like a 10 second cooldown, so they cannot cast it right after its been dispelled.<br />
<br />
The books are still out on metamorphosis, You basicly throw all your talents into pet talents till the 51 point demo talent then all of a sudden you cant even have a pet? Seems kinda silly to me. If demonform was a toggle that slowly ate your life away instead of a 5 min cooldown 30 sec buff then it might be interesting. Not to mention you should still beable to have your pet.<br />
<br />
And thunder is not as bad as it seems, other classes are getting knock back type spells, and its definitly not 200 yards, I doubt its even 20 yards. Its probably gunna be like 5-10 yards. Its a get out of my face spell that elemental shamans really, REALLY need.<br />
<br />
Tho IMO druids dont need a knockback, they already can root and immobalize you....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And has ANYONE even noticed that feral charge can be used while in catform now? do you know how huge that is?!</div></div><hr />
