Patch 7.2 - Unlocking Artifact Traits<br />
Patch 7.2 brings new Artifact Traits (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/artifact-traits?filter-patch=23436) for everyone, along with higher Artifact Knowledge ranks. Unlocking these traits is done by completing a series of quests, with several different versions that depend on your role. <br />
<br />
The quest series starts by asking you to unlock all of the traits on your Artifact weapon (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/46744-greater-power-for-greater-threats). After this is done, you head to the Broken Shore to investigate (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/46765-the-broken-shore-investigating-the-legion), finding some kind of object. You bring this object back to the Council of Six in Dalaran and then head off on your role's specific quest line. <br />
<br />
At the end of the quest line, you return to Dalaran and the Council empowers your Artifact weapon, unlocking the new traits. You can see these new traits in our Artifact Calculator (http://ptr.wowdb.com/artifact-calculator). <br />

BlizzCon 2017 Contests – Mixing Things Up<br />
Greetings, cosplayers, moviemakers, and artists! BlizzCon 2017 is official, and some of you are already eager to get started on your contest creations—but before you set that creativity to full blast, we just wanted to have a quick chat.<br />
<br />
After 10 years of BlizzCon—and 10 years of contests—we’re taking a fresh look at our approach to BlizzCon contests. We’re considering some new approaches to how we handle things, and are taking another look at our contests’ structure and format at the show. Ultimately, our goal is to celebrate and showcase you guys the best way possible.<br />
<br />
What does this mean for our contestants, you ask? Right now, nothing. Right now we can tell you the Costume Contest is still incoming, so feel free to start crafting away! In the coming weeks however, we will be announcing a few tweaks, and just wanted to give you all a heads up as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
Thank you again for continuing to make BlizzCon so very special with all your incredible talents. It’s all of your who make BlizzCon something we look forward to year after year, and can’t wait to see what you create this year!<br />
<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
With that recent tire fire that was that Reddit post, you sure have some thick skin, Ben Brode mentioned that being sorta the face of a game opens you up to brunt of the community’s attacks when people asked why him and Yong Woo didn’t do more designer insights. Do you feel it’s important for a dev to have thick skin when dealing with this stuff.<br />
I don’t think you can be a good game designer if you have thin skin. You have to subject your ideas to the crucible of review, whether that happens internally or after players see your design.<br />
<br />
I do think you can be a good game designer if you have thick skin, but don’t have thick enough skin to open yourself up to direct communication with players. Some of my favorite games have been made by people that can barely stand to have a conversation with other humans, let alone open themselves up to the internet.<br />
<br />
But if you’re going to go that route, you just have to be really, really good at what you do. You need a purity of vision or an ability to foresee problems that just isn’t that common in developers. I don’t have that. Way back at Ensemble, when we weren’t sure if design A or design B made more sense, I said “Let’s just ask players what they think.” <br />
<br />
You don’t have to ask up front. You can launch a feature, monitor the response, and then iterate on that feature. But you have to get that feedback at some point. Lead Champion Designer Riot Scruffy the other day said something like “Even when you’ve really thought about it, tested and iterated, your chance of nailing a great design is about 70%. So you have to be prepared to iterate based on player feedback. You have to leave time for the follow-up work.” <br />
<br />
(I also don’t mean to imply that asking players on Reddit or forums is the only way we gather feedback.)<br />
<br />
Now, I don’t subscribe to the idea that players should just be able to say whatever the hell they want to, and developers should just suck it up because that’s their job. I value communication, and communication is easier if you treat each other like human beings. But I also recognize that players get emotional or frustrated, and I recognize that the power dynamic between passionate player and developer who just doesn’t get it can exacerbate that frustration.<br />
<br />
But there are limits.<br />
<br />
I don’t block a lot of players on Twitter, but I do block them. I don’t answer stupidly rude questions, except to make a point of the fact that they aren’t going to actually bring me to tears. Sorry.<br />
<br />
I’ve had weird phone calls in the middle of the night. I’ve had death threats. I've had Blizzard security offer to monitor my house. I’ve had designers who had to work with the FBI on threats. I’m also an upper class, straight, white dude, and I know developers who aren’t who have gotten much, much worse from players. There’s no reason for that. We all love games. That already gives us a lot in common.<br />
<br />
I try and remind players all the time that your communication is going to be more effective if you’re professional about it, because then you’re actually talking about the problem and not venting about how neglected you feel. If you have a job or go to school, you probably have coworkers or teachers you disagree with that you still have to treat like human beings. Developers deserve the same respect. I know it might score you internet points to attack someone in an over the top matter. You’re better than that. Resist the urge.

I honestly think it's closer to 95+% not doing it too. The numbers on an MMO Champ poll tend to be people who read the MMO Champ front page stuff, which includes micro holiday announcements. There are plenty of casual players who don't use external websites and also don't notice the postings on the launcher or calendar by Blizz, and probably way more who do see those things and just don't care.<br />
<br />
I liked the idea of the Silithus one because it was a memorial for a cool community event. I don't understand the ones like Un'goro Madness at all though.</div></div><hr />

Its designed to trick people into thinking ur getting lots of &quot;Compelling content&quot; when its just easy copy paste crap to make fanboys jump on people with real feedback about bad content, all we are getting now is just scaled up numbers and more AP grinds.<br />
<br />
People can hate me for saying it, but its the truth. I look forward to 7.2, but again its just re scaled old content.</div></div><hr />

I gave a shot for the hippogryph-event and the lure for me was the possibility to have something funny toy'ish to show off when playing with my friends (i.e. the bird on my shoulder). After getting it on with the multiple day duration, I soon did a daily casual arena just to notice the bird was gone for good already when zoning to the pvp-instance. Talk about mood killer.<br />
<br />
To me, these events don't seem to be tested enough. You may be able to accomplish the &quot;reward&quot; there is (should we thank PTR testers here?), but its integrability to the external world isn't confirmed even in a very basic level. I'm eagerly following when an event causes some serious troubles at the world, such as exploits.</div></div><hr />

Yes when you complete the quest to get refunded down to 35 your wepoan just gains the full paragon. Damage and Stan. So if you have it you keep it. If you don't you get it.</div></div><hr />

And thats fine, you don't have to take part in it.<br />
I had fun killing those dinos for an hour or two, traveling with a huge pack of players in an area we don't often go to anymore. If anyone didn't, well, nothing I can do about that.<br />
<br />
If it had any rewards, you wouldn't have had any more fun with it, but still feel compelled to do it, wouldn't that be worse?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mix both. I play for rewards if I play alone - but these rewards can vary (I am not only motivated by loot, but also by vanity items and achievements, and sometimes also for experience, this is the reason why I have at least one character of each class at a high level). But I also play for fun, like when I am doing things with guild buddies which I usually don't need much anymore.<br />
<br />
These micro-holidays have no value for me whatsoever. They don't have collectable rewards, and they don't have much of a special experience for me to offer, because they are completely disconnected from the current storyline. Normal holiday events at least have a connection to real-life holiday, interpreted through the PoV of Azeroth. These micro-events have nothing which would bother me, and none of my guild mates wanted to participate either, so I did not even had a social motivator to go there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My first event i partook in was the Diablo event, never going to do another event with CRZ in the game. Such a cluster fuck doing it and these mini events are no different, i think it's half the reason why people don't do it, along with what you said.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly, I don't think that's a fair comparison what so ever. <br />
<br />
1) Wrath and raiding, (and for myself currently), I raided for fun, I raided with people that I liked spending time with. The loot was needed to stay relevant, so I can keep playing with them. Every single item I needed in wrath was on a wait list (DKP system), hell even when it was my turn, if we had new raiders with less gear, I'd often give them it, I had my 4 piece bonus, I was next in line for shards for shadowmourne I was happy. Anyways my point being on this one, to keep having fun, you need the loot, they go hand in hand. Don't get loot = Fall behind = Hold team up = Benched<br />
<br />
2) I agree we shouldn't get raid type loot in these micro holidays, but I think it's plain ridiculous to have something ingame, where there's no sort of reward. I really don't care what it could have been, a pet, a mount, a toy to change you into a raptor or even cosmetic items or on use effect items with hilarious effects, think of the ape in the bubble type one. <br />
<br />
Personally, I thought the AQ event was great, if I had my way I'd of re released the black scarab for one person per server and a handful of scarab titles. But even just flying the colours for the year, that was a great little idea. <br />
<br />
So yes, I didn't do it because there was no type of reward, I thought it was pretty pointless, there is so much to do in legion currently, that if you want to introduce things like, you need to given the player base a incentive to do it. Raids? we get loot to show off, exclusive mounts and titles. Timewalking, we get stupidly high gear for stupidly easy content - we also get a cache with rewards us with a 875 + item for doing 5. Everything else in wow has a reward system of some kind, and I don't think theres anything wrong with that. But just because I'm getting a reward for something, doesn't mean it can't be fun.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't have to be much , a stupid achievement would add 50% more players involved .<br />
It really surprises me that blizzard did not know this .<br />
Are these devs all newbies or just lazy ?</div></div><hr />

They upscaled the Twilight Cultists during the Silithus event and then never returned them back to original levels, which is what they have done now to Devilsaurs. They will keep having these micro holidays until each old world zone has at lease a mob that auto scales.</div></div><hr />

If the boss happened to have that poison aoe adaptation, you were guaranteed to die if you didn't have a healer, because it was unavoidable. That's just dumb in this day and age where they facilitate not having to group up. Since there was no real point to doing the event, it shouldn't require grouping up.</div></div><hr />

the fix for AP is making AP bassicly no point in farming it once you get to the new paragon<br />
and AK is being doubled, brought to 50</div></div><hr />

A new 50 point paragon trait is added. Concordance of the Legionfall. It increases your primary stat by 2000 for 10 seconds, going up with every point.</div></div><hr />

Tried them twice and it was basically nothing to do except kill some mobs - really don't get how they're supposed to be fun. More fun to just keep doing the stuff I usually do like dungeons or raids. As I heard the dino thing was just dinos scaled to your level and if you killed them you got a temporary buff - not enough to make me bother to even fly down there and I guess a lot of people felt the same.</div></div><hr />

Hard to believe they can't come up with more ideas for the Darkmoon Faire. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fun&quot; is a moving target, tho - some players might like puzzles, some might like running around UnGoro for shits and giggles, some might like chasing easter eggs around town. They're trying stuff, which is better than nothing - how many years did the holiday events get untouched and un-updated? <br />
<br />
Overall, it's just more of the devs isolating everything into it's proper box. Can't get any sort of player progression or edge, or the raiders will cry because their raid leaders will force them to run it, so everything in the &quot;holiday&quot; box has to be meaningless or short-lived, as a reward. <br />
<br />
But then, on the other hand, they spend a lot of time making a fun puzzle set like the hidden artifact skins, and everyone throws a fit because they can't read exactly how to do it with no effort and get it done in 5 minutes. <br />
<br />
Nobody can win, not the devs, not the players, nobody. <br />
<br />
One of my favorite pets was the wolf puppy, that you got from the cave outside blackrock, and you had to catch one in UBRS during a boss encounter. Love to see them do more stuff like that. No, wait, not in today's game environment. &quot;Hey, I need to catch a pup here!&quot; &quot;GTFO newb dont slow us down&quot; *You have been removed from the party*<br />
<br />
Yeah, I'm cynical. Sue me.<br />

I don't know about that. Back in vanilla, we did all kinds of goofy things, just for the fun of it - and those times are the ones I remember the most. <br />
<br />
Granted, the game these days is all about &quot;stuff&quot;, where other players might as well be AI, for all of the interaction going on. The only time people seemed to want to talk to others, back when I played, was to show off &quot;stuff&quot; or shitpost in chat. <br />
<br />
I guess the view on the hamster wheel is different, huh? Gotta keep running! What? Stop running and do something that doesn't move the wheel? Crazy talk!</div></div><hr />

Fun is subjective.<br />

People can do things for fun without a carrot dangled in front of them.</div></div><hr />

Of course it is. But that almost 90% of all players didn't even touch the event says a lot. And I'd be surprised if all of the 10+% auf players, who tried the event did also enjoy it. I mean I participated in a few micro holidays and I certainly didn't enjoy them and as far as I heard neither did any of my ingame friends.</div></div><hr />
