<br />
This Week in WoW History<br />
We're taking a look back at old MMO-Champion posts and World of Warcraft news that occurred during this time in previous years.<br />
<br />
Reins of Poseidus<br />
The 4.1 PTR added a Bind on Equip mount drop in the Abyssal Depths. The Reins of Poseidus is an underwater mount usable in any underwater area. The Vashj’ir questline rewarded players with a similar mount that was only usable within the zone to make questing easier. This mount can still be obtained or sold in the game today if you manage to kill Poseidus.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Scarlet Monastery Revamp<br />
One of the original dungeons in the game received a full revamp and bumped up in level to make it relevant. The Graveyard area where the Hallow’s End event takes place got combined with the Cathedral into a single instance, and the same thing happened with the Armory and the Library. Quite a few aesthetic upgrades were made, such as monks training in the Cathedral area, and new mini-events added such as having to get across the archery training area hiding behind a target, or baiting the hounds to devour the Houndmaster.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
New Mounts<br />
The Ironbound Wraithcharger and two variants of the Armored Dragonhawk Mounts were added with Patch 5.3. The Dragonhawks were announced as a reward for the Mount Parade achievement, requiring players to collect 200 mounts. This mount has a Red variation for the Horde, and a blue one for the Alliance. The Ironbound Wraithcharger was not officially added to the game until the addition of the Wrath of the Lich King Timewalking event.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Challenge Mode Weapons<br />
The Warlords of Draenor Challenge mode rewards this this time around were unique weapons with very interesting animations. Each weapon type received at least one unique weapon, but most types had multiple weapons. These weapons could be unlocked after completing all of the dungeons in Gold time. Until the Legion Pre-Patch each class could only purchase weapons they could use, however after the Legion event all of them were unlocked for players who have completed the challenge.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Xavius Shoulders<br />
The last boss of Emerald Nightmare, Xavius, dropped one of the best Leather shoulders in the game so far. The First Satyr’s Spaulders can still be obtained on Heroic or Mythic difficulty. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Fox Mount<br />
The Reins of the Llothien Prowler was discovered on the Legion Beta. This mount can be obtained via a quest which is started by a unique item that can be obtained through a few ways. After going through the questline and interrupting the Fox Hunt, players are rewarded with this unique mount, which also has an interesting mount special.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft: Traveler<br />
The Traveler children’s book series was announced to be released late 2016. This book tells a story of a kid who finds himself lost, but has a magical compass guiding his way. The book is set in the World of Warcraft, but shown from a very different perspective than we’re used to. Part 1 and 2 of this book, both written by Greg Weisman can still be purchased today.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Patch 7.2<br />
The Broken Shore patch brought a number of changes to the game, which have been discussed in previous posts. The patch unlocked The Cathedral of Eternal Night dungeon, new class mounts, furthering the class order hall campaign, new music, multiple spell animation updates, flying, artifact challenges, the pet battle dungeon, and crafted legendary items. Tomb of Sargeras was also added in this patch, however it was only opened to players later down the line.<br />

The models have not received their tail upgrade yet. Until they do, it's a little ehhhhh to be sharing them like everyone seems to have freaked out over a brand new discovery.<br />
<br />
If anything, pointing out the official list of reputations for the expansion and which faction they belong to is more interesting, such as Tortollan being confirmed Neutral alongside Champions of Azeroth, Voldunai being confirmed Horde only, and the War Effort reputations being their own thing.</div></div><hr />

I was really hoping for a new Starcraft pet as a thing for the anniversary. I guess Blizz felt a 20th anniversary was appropriately celebrated with a FoS not rewarding a pet, mount, title, mog, or anything else actually usable in WoW.</div></div><hr />

1. they are special unique shoulders not with a set<br />
2. they are literally made of fur...<br />
<br />
