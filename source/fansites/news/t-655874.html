Hunters - Tame a Worgen Pet! 
All the cool kids have a worgen pet and you know you want one too! I took the time to make a short video to explain how to tame this pet but before going into the explanation I would like to point out that this is going to be hotfixed very soon and you might not keep the pet after the fix. It's still worth trying I guess.  
 As you put it Zennie, we are currently discussing this issue.

Hunters - Tame a Worgen Pet!<br />
All the cool kids have a worgen pet and you know you want one too! I took the time to make a short video to explain how to tame this pet but before going into the explanation I would like to point out that this is going to be hotfixed very soon and you might not keep the pet after the fix. It's still worth trying I guess. <br />
As you put it Zennie, we are currently discussing this issue.<br />
<br />
It is not intended that Garwal can be tamed while in worgen form and will be addressed via a hotfix in the near future. When we have determined how to handle situations where hunters have already tamed Garwal we will let you know.<br />
Now that you're aware that you can eventually lose this pet, here is how you get it:<br />
<br />
1. First you need the Alpha Worg (A) (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=11326) / Alpha Worg (H) (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=11324) quest. You won't be able to get the pet if you already completed this quest.<br />
2. Find Garwal and take him down to 59% life. % might vary slightly depending on people, just do a few tests on your own.<br />
3. Use Wyvern Sting. <br />
4. When there is 11 or 10 seconds left on the Wyvern Sting sleep effect, start taming Garwal. Again, the time might vary slightly depending on people.<br />
5. The goal here is to complete the taming process right when Garwal says: Enough of this charade! <br />
<br />
If you did it correctly, you will have your own worgen pet! If you want even more information about this before you give it a try, make sure you check the post on Mania's Arcania (http://www.maniasarcania.com/2009/07/04/pet-worgen/)<br />

Patch 3.2 - Item Comparison<br />
One of the nice minor feature added to the game with Patch 3.2 is the item comparison, you now have a stat summary when you compare an item with your current piece of equipment (hold Shift).<br />

Brew of the Month<br />
Brew of the Month is a new achievement that is being added and is part of the meta achievement. Brew of the Year is still there but is no longer part of the meta achievement. Brew of the Month can be obtained much much faster than 1 year. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/18313393541-brew-of-the-month--what-a-longstrange-trip.html))<br />
<br />
Random Loot in Vault of Archavon<br />
The loot tables for the bosses in the Vault aren't determined in a manner different than those used for generating loot for creatures in every other dungeon, or in the game world as a whole for that matter. A certain number of items are programmed to drop and there's a percentage-based algorithm used to pseudo-randomly determine what loot drops, regardless of any outside factors (i.e. who enters the instance first, what classes are present in the raid, who the raid leader is, etc). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/18312413906-fix-vault-loot.html))<br />
<br />
Emblems and Instance Drops<br />
We are not altering the emblem system, as you suggested, because it's easier than changing the way loot tables are generated. We are altering the emblem system to allow players to choose more how they spend their time at level 80 while gearing up, increase the appeal and relevance of 5-player dungeons, and allow newcomers to the end game a better chance of getting geared for the next tier of raiding.<br />
<br />
We feel the loot system is as fair as it is unfair and adds a bit of a need for diligence on the part of the player to seek a certain piece of gear. The Vault in particular would be a little bit too convenient if it very intelligently dropped items for the players who are present. The items that drop in the Vault are extremely good when compared to the time and effort required to kill the bosses that drop them, and we do not necessarily want players walking in with a great chance of getting such items every time they run the instance.

Yeah, I don't know why they had to add stuff like that to the game. We already had something like that from the mod authors and anyone with a reasonable computer wouldn't have any trouble with having a few mods if they wanted. Though my guild and I do joke sometimes about people who &quot;play on cash registers&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Steal concept of any previouos rpg/mmorpg: Check<br />
<br />
But actually I had to think of &quot;nigga stole my bike&quot;<br />
<br />
- they add this to the core game to make it a reliably source of information that doesn't brake with the next patch and needs days to work correctly again. also they can optimize performance by bypassing the addon interface (and I'm sure the addon interface leads to some overhead that can be minimized by integrating it into the core) - also not everyone knows of these good addons. hope they integrate something like altoholic too :D</div></div><hr />

If you don't like it - don't do it, this is not arena. You will have a lot of alternatives from Naxx 10 to Ulduar 25 Hard to get conquest badges and 4 Colloseum lockouts for new badges.<br />
<br />
P.S. If you rage about conquests I do not know if I should tell you that Colloseum 10 man normal that everyone and their dogs will pug will drop items on par/better than Ulduar 25 hard modes currently.</div></div><hr />

instead of complaining you could have written this exact same post to some blizzard staff..don't know ptr feedback forum or something, so they can fix it (that is what the ptr is for, not that you can look at all the new content and say &quot;i cleared it already&quot; when it goes live).<br />

<br />
I've been helping friends on my server and we tamed Garwal 10 times, using this technique (requires a friend of any class, can be used with any spec BM, MM, SV)<br />
<br />
Hunter<br />
<br />
wait for Garwal's respawn (2 minutes)<br />
attack him until he goes down to 6900-7000 health (no more, no less)<br />
stop DPS'ing and start taming<br />
<br />
<br />
Friend<br />
<br />
watch the Tame Beast timer on Garwal<br />
when timer is 1-2 second close to the end, attack Garwal<br />
<br />
<br />
Done. The trick here is just downing Garwal to 6900-7000 health. If your friend is able to shot him 1 second before the end of the taming process, you are done. Watch out for lag: if you have any, don't waste too much time. This method is safer (and faster) because it does not need any luck and/or specific gear. Anyone can do it, it's just a matter of reaching the 6900-7000 health point. Avoid attacking with full gear, just go with bare hands, 1hander or whatever: a low DPS will help you reach the perfect number.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;The items that drop in the Vault are extremely good when compared to the time and effort required to kill the bosses that drop them, and we do not necessarily want players walking in with a great chance of getting such items every time they run the instance&quot; I think that is why. Funny that at one point ppl complain how stuff apparently just drops when you look at a boss and then turn around and find another system also not to their liking?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you don't like it - don't do it, this is not arena. You will have a lot of alternatives from Naxx 10 to Ulduar 25 Hard to get conquest badges and 4 Colloseum lockouts for new badges.<br />
<br />
P.S. If you rage about conquests I do not know if I should tell you that Colloseum 10 man normal that everyone and their dogs will pug will drop items on par/better than Ulduar 25 hard modes currently.<br />
<br />
<br />
It IS working fine. We're not at the &quot;end game&quot; yet, a little bit far from it. No need to &quot;BoJusticesing&quot; the system, yet. Remember runing Karazhan forever even with heroics and other better raid option seven at the &quot;TBC end game&quot;? Wanna run Naxx forever? Or the same fastest heroics every day? That's where people will go for faster/easy badge epics! You're not going to, by some miracle, find pugs for every heroic and raid tier, but instead find pugs only for the daily heroic/regular (if they're not the fastest/easiest ones like AN/UK alread), naxx 10, naxx25, eoe 10, eoe 25, os 10, os 25, ulduar 10, ulduar 25... really think people will prefer to bang their heads in Ulduar instead of naxxlol? They don't have time to do it now, why they would have after the changes?!<br />
<br />
IF Blizzard really wanted to &quot;fix&quot;, they would increase the number of heroic emblems drop on heroics, reward valor for daily regular, reward conqueror for daily heroic, drop valor in both naxx 10 and 25 (same for eoe10/25 and os10/25), conqueror for both ulduar10 and 25, while also giving the option to turn in like 3 heroism for 1 valor, 3 valor for 1 conqueror (remember that you can only buy epic gems with heroism, so, not everyone will just upgrade for conqueror). And even implement a weekly quest for raid (like how WG quests work now) that would reward like 10 emblems of said raid or conqueror ones (maybe even 5/10 triumph).<br />
<br />
Done, system UPDATED, people doing more stuff and the system doesn't get &quot;BoJusticecised&quot; in 3.2 instead of at least in Arthas patch.<br />
<br />
But no... &quot;I pay, ME WANTS!&quot;<br />
<br />
About the Coliseum Pugs, its better to pug the latest ones instead of pugging the same old raid forever thanks to free badges.</div></div><hr />

Don't worry pro hunter, it will soon be hotfixed. Then you'll be able to QQ about that.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for VoA - nice to know that they have a system that actually likes to dick around with you and not drop the gear you need just because it feels like it. It then comes to the question - why is it there? To give players gear? But if it is made so that the loot is calculated and selected according to the raid setup and made sure that not everyone gets what they need... oooooooh. I get it. It says &quot;give players gear&quot; not &quot;give players gear they will use&quot;. Nice.<br />
<br />
Might seem like I am QQing about it (probably am), but this makes the questionable use of the instance even more questionable.</div></div><hr />

Do some reading, Garwal is a wolf when you start to attack it, it ticks over into his other form @ some point into the fight.<br />
The trick is that you start taming him in his wolf form and just when he transforms finish the taming.<br />
He will stay in his worgen form then, just check the movies, plenty of hunters doing fail tries too when they are to early or to late.</div></div><hr />

Are you guys QQing about vault serious? It's a freaking 15 minute start to finish loot pinata. So it doesnt always drop loot the raid can use? So what? Count yourself lucky there is such a loot/badge pinata. Complaining about it not dropping stuff the raid needs is ridiculous. Much harder bosses in much harder instances have been dropping stupid unused loot since day 1 lol.<br />

How about every time a goddamn idol/libram/sigil/totem drops that noone can use, or every druid/etc in the raid says &quot;it's terrible&quot;. That's been happening for years and is a far more annoying thing imo.<br />

I think people are complaining, and with good reason, that some of the ulduar hardmodes esp in 25 are damn hard, and to make the loot completely trivial in the following content patch is just a slap in the face.<br />
By all means make previous content easier so casuals can get it, but sometimes it feels like they just go too far and so far 3.2 feels like about 2 days before wotlk came out - ie all your epix are about to suck again.</div></div><hr />

same with PVE gear... with every new raid tier, the old raid tear becomes easier to get....<br />

this way, &quot;Mr. 600 days played&quot; has had his fun getting gear (which is starting to look old) and doing the raids (which are starting to get boring), can now move up to the next tier raid.<br />

If he's a beast why do you need to go through such lengths to tame him? Shouldn't he be tamable all the time no matter what form he's in? =) And are the other Worgen in the game beasts?<br />

Blizzard is also hotfixing this, probably they just misclassified him and that's all they need to change. Either way...since it is being hotfixed the point is ultimately moot.

Oh shut up already. If you so want I am working my ass off in Ulduar and I don't mind this system. It is not to please whining casuals. With the system I can spend my otherwise useless 200 emblems of valor gearing my alts with BoE bracers. I can buy orbs to craft stuff and still only fill 2-5 slots that way. It allows new recruits to gear up quicker inside our raidforce (especially now that attendance in summer is dropping). I also allows people who levelled slower, were ill, had to quit, went to the army..WHATEVER to join the current raiding tier more easily IF THEY SO WISH.<br />

<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how you got that from the quote.<br />
<br />
The loot tables for the bosses in the Vault aren't determined in a manner different than those used for generating loot for creatures in every other dungeon, or in the game world as a whole for that matter. A certain number of items are programmed to drop and there's a percentage-based algorithm used to pseudo-randomly determine what loot drops, regardless of any outside factors (i.e. who enters the instance first, what classes are present in the raid, who the raid leader is, etc).<br />
<br />
Is the phrase &quot;pseudo-random&quot; what is making you think it is weighted? A random number generated by a program can never be &quot;truly random&quot; so if I had to guess he was probably more referring to that. People love to come back and say &quot;it's not really random though! You have to seed of something so therefore it's not random!&quot;</div></div><hr />

Making emblems of conquest drop from heroics only decreases their relevance; people aren't suddenly going to enjoy heroics better, they'll only be doing them for the emblems, making the actual loot that drops from those heroics even less appealing.<br />
<br />
Nice roundabout way to break a system that worked fine, for the sake of &quot;fixing&quot; it, like regular Blizzard style.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Is not that the dungeons suck(theyre alright: even has its own hardmode), its that ppl want to catch up to their friends who are raiding t9 or alts that are getting geared for that matter. As for my main i do raid ulduar cuz ive been playing through t7 but as for my alt is hard finding ppl to do nax (hardly anyone wants to run it anymore) they all just want to raid ulduar. AS for dungeons that suck in wotlk are; Oculus(this instance seriously sucks), OK, and AN.</div></div><hr />

Then take the add-on after this. Heck, Ratingbuster could just update their add-on to just add the actual stats to the item comparison and become an even more lightweight add-on.<br />

Blizzard isn't trying to replace RatingBuster. They're just adding it for people that don't wish to get it, but still want to see the item comparisons.<br />
<br />
Heck, I'll be happy because this patch will take out 3 add-ons that I won't need anymore on my characters.

<br />
Will Bob really be able to go through all that content when it's now technically on farm? If all the guilds are going to Argent Tournament and all, why should they go to Naxxramas, Malygos, and OS if John's already geared out? Basically, if Bob got into the Lv. 80 game too late, but still wants to be raiding with John, why shouldn't he be able to?<br />
<br />
Look at it like this...because you now have a reason to run heroics and Naxx and such, Bob will be able to get the gear he needs to be competitive with John, and John can get badges that can help him finish up his T8 stuff or his gems. Everyone benefits.<br />
<br />
John shouldn't be punished to go through Naxx again to help Bob get geared up, and Bob shouldn't be punished to be too late in the game to play competitively with John. It's simple as that. <br />
<br />
And don't go &quot;Well, he can pug Naxx like everyone else.&quot; You get so much more benefit from just running with your guild. They'll see that you need gear and give you gear, and they can gear out anyone that's left behind.<br />
<br />
Edit: Also, could you please not say that people that are two tiers behind are &quot;bads&quot;? Just because a person was 80 a week after the game was released, that doesn't make them any better or the person that just got to 80 any worse.</div></div><hr />

Because he turned up late and hasn't worked hard enough yet to deserve his place in Ulduar. If he works hard then he'll be able to raid with John.

<br />
<br />
My day isn't complete until I read the ramblings of a complete moron on MMO-Champion.<br />
<br />
Don't be an ignorant tool. Just because you've been raiding for several months, doesn't make you &quot;good&quot; compared to people that haven't. I know several people that simply don't raid anymore (most have families now) that could still run circles around your so called &quot;goods&quot; any day if they so chose to raid again.<br />
<br />
Who are shortcuts annoying to? The person trying to catch up? Or the person that has some ass-backwards, egotistical look on how everything is &quot;supposed&quot; to be done? It's the latter, which is you.<br />
<br />
You need to realize that Blizzards main goal is to keep people playing, and not appeasing the few people that take this game far too seriously. By forcing Bob to go through tiers of content just to catch up, he's probably going to get frustrated doing so for a multitude of reasons. Trying to find a guild doing older content. Being ridiculed by people like you, etc. Either that, or simply be overwhelmed with the amount of work he needs to put in and not do it at all. <br />
<br />
Another thing you fools fail to realize, is that come next patch, when all these Conquest badges are readily accessible, Conquest will be obsolete. Ask yourself this. If you're the person that likes the challenge, and enjoys the progression of YOUR character.. then why are you concerning yourselves with what played A and B do? If you're so above these &quot;bads&quot; that entitles you to look down on them, then you are obviously in the next tier of raiding, and will be obtaining Triumph badges. While these &quot;bads&quot; are obtaining outdated tier and poorly itemized offset pieces by running heroics.<br />
<br />
Oh but wait, they can get Tier 9 through heroic badges too, right? They sure can. You should do the math and see how long it will take these people to get 2 pieces of Tier 9 (which will be inferior to the Tier 9 tokens that drop out of Colosseum)<br />
<br />
My point? The people whining about this, aren't thinking about the whole picture. This is not gamebreaking. In a nutshell, they are simply bringing the bar up. Instead of starting out with Heroism Badges, you now start out with Conquest badges. They are simply shifting the initial level of progression up a couple notches to promote their content. Get a clue. Hardcore in WoW means 1 thing... &quot;I did it first&quot;.<br />
<br />
And you obviously care enough to write a lengthy post whining about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Before 3.2, 1 Naxx 10-man versus 3 heroics was just as bad. You still get emblems of heroism for heroics and 10-man Naxx. And you'd also get much more gear from 10-man Naxx versus 3 heroics mentioned to get competitive enough for Ulduar10. This just makes it a bit easier for those who were late into the game to get the gear they need to play the end-game with others.<br />
You call it &quot;holding their hand&quot;, I call it &quot;helping the late ones get gear.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
John would be getting that regardless. Bob is getting a boost from Blizzard<br />
<br />
No, he wouldn't. Ulduar's like 15 badges or so. It's not exactly the best way to farm for those badges. With heroics, he is able to get those badges for everything he'd need, and he'd be able to get the Runed Orbs he needs for his crafted stuff, and he'd be able to get the badges for the new gems. [unless they decide to put gems on the Emblem of Triumph currency, which would be silly]<br />
<br />
Look, the fact is, John would benefit from this just as much as Bob would. Hell, we haven't even talked about the possibility that Bob might end up being a bigger asset for the raid team than John, but because Bob is two tiers below, pugging Naxx, they can't use him to their advantage yet. This solves it in a way. The problem next is people in the Argent Tournament tier not wanting to run Naxx, which my next point helps out.<br />
<br />
<br />
Going through Naxx isn't a punishment. 99% of people in Ulduar had to do it. Why shouldn't he?<br />
<br />
Because we're going into a new tier of content. Remember Karazhan? Would people in the Black Temple tier of content really want to go all the way back to Karazhan just to gear out two or three people? No. Kara was more like an off night clear. They'd be more likely to go through Tempest Keep or SSC, because they had the people and that content was closer to Black Temple than Kara.<br />
However, Karazhan had one benefit that was realized a bit later on into the game: Badges of Justice. Kara was an easy way to get badges for the gear that would help you out in Black Temple and, later, in Sunwell Plateau. That made Kara attractive enough to go through again, not so much as a serious raid, but more to help those who were late to the party and still need gear.<br />
<br />
Argent Tournament isn't going to be huge. I highly doubt we'd spend more than a few hours in a single raid lockout, non-hard mode considered. What's the most likely candidate for off-nights? Ulduar! That'll make Naxxramas and the other T7 content nigh-on worthless...an afterthought if anything. A Monday &quot;Oh, let's just DO something for the love of God&quot; raid.<br />
<br />
It's a preventive measure to make sure their tiers are all used to their fullest ability. And it's certainly not going to break the game, either.</div></div><hr />

Well..like you said: PPl still do Naxx 10 and 25. All guilds that now spring up on my server do Naxx 10 and 25 first. You just will NOT get all the gear handed to you in 3.2. 2-5 slots get filled with emblem gear....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TobiasX</div><div class="date">2009-07-07, 08:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Before 3.2, 1 Naxx 10-man versus 3 heroics was just as bad. You still get emblems of heroism for heroics and 10-man Naxx. And you'd also get much more gear from 10-man Naxx versus 3 heroics mentioned to get competitive enough for Ulduar10. This just makes it a bit easier for those who were late into the game to get the gear they need to play the end-game with others.<br />
Fair point, but why should it be that easy? Why should they be able to skip an entire tier of content? Again &quot;Because it's old&quot; isn't an excuse.<br />
<br />
<br />
You call it &quot;holding their hand&quot;, I call it &quot;helping the late ones get gear.&quot;No, he wouldn't. Ulduar's like 15 badges or so. It's not exactly the best way to farm for those badges. With heroics, he is able to get those badges for everything he'd need, and he'd be able to get the Runed Orbs he needs for his crafted stuff, and he'd be able to get the badges for the new gems. [unless they decide to put gems on the Emblem of Triumph currency, which would be silly]<br />
People who're 'late to the party' shouldn't get helped. They should have to earn their spot in Ulduar by working through Naxx, just like the rest of us did, regardless of when they started their raiding progression.<br />
<br />
<br />
Look, the fact is, John would benefit from this just as much as Bob would. Hell, we haven't even talked about the possibility that Bob might end up being a bigger asset for the raid team than John, but because Bob is two tiers below, pugging Naxx, they can't use him to their advantage yet. This solves it in a way. <br />
If you don't want to pugg naxx then do it with a guild that's progressing through Naxx. Oh, wait, those won't exist anymore in 3.2 thanks to this change.<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem next is people in the Argent Tournament tier not wanting to run Naxx, which my next point helps out.Because we're going into a new tier of content. <br />
The answer should be: 'tough luck'. Not everyone enjoyed the abomination that 10 and 25 man Naxxramas was compared to the 40 man version but we did it and we earned our spot in Ulduar by avoiding the poisonous lava, paying attention to debuffs and standing 10 feet apart so we didn't chain ice blocks. There's no guarantee that Bob has done any of these things (though he might of in TBC) so he should have to do it all over again with the new tier just like the rest of us did.<br />
<br />
<br />
Remember Karazhan? Would people in the Black Temple tier of content really want to go all the way back to Karazhan just to gear out two or three people? No. Kara was more like an off night clear. They'd be more likely to go through Tempest Keep or SSC, because they had the people and that content was closer to Black Temple than Kara.<br />
However, Karazhan had one benefit that was realized a bit later on into the game: Badges of Justice. Kara was an easy way to get badges for the gear that would help you out in Black Temple and, later, in Sunwell Plateau. That made Kara attractive enough to go through again, not so much as a serious raid, but more to help those who were late to the party and still need gear.<br />
Karazhan had a much bigger benefit that you seem to have missed: Idiot Check. Each boss showed you how well new recruits could cope with different situations and boss effects. Black Temple guilds would either gear people up through Kara / SSC / TK in 1 week or they'd only accept people with a certain level of gear, both of which are perfectly acceptable.<br />
<br />
<br />
Argent Tournament isn't going to be huge. I highly doubt we'd spend more than a few hours in a single raid lockout, non-hard mode considered. What's the most likely candidate for off-nights? Ulduar! That'll make Naxxramas and the other T7 content nigh-on worthless...an afterthought if anything. A Monday &quot;Oh, let's just DO something for the love of God&quot; raid.<br />
... for the people who worked through Naxxramas, and Eye of Eternity, and Obsidian Sanctum, and Ulduar. Those are the people who should be in the Argent Tournament raid and those were the people in Black Temple / Hyjal Summit / Sunwell Plateau: The people who worked their asses off and showed they had what it took to raid them by destroying 2 tiers of content.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's a preventive measure to make sure their tiers are all used to their fullest ability. And it's certainly not going to break the game, either.<br />
<br />
It's an excuse to make sure the majority of players are at the bleeding edge of content and it's an insult to the people who worked through Nax / EoE / OS; it cheapens their accomplishments and that won't be made up for by a higher achievement score.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well..like you said: PPl still do Naxx 10 and 25. All guilds that now spring up on my server do Naxx 10 and 25 first. You just will NOT get all the gear handed to you in 3.2. 2-5 slots get filled with emblem gear....<br />
<br />
And /bow to skylla05 and TobiasX <br />
<br />
There were guilds like that. There won't be in 3.2 because there's no point. Do heroics for a while longer and gear yourself up. The Naxx drops are obsolete.</div></div><hr />

It's obsolete to the people running Ulduar because they're raiding the next tier of content and they already have it. The badge change makes it obsolete to everyone. If people want to raid Tier 8 content they should need to raid Tier 7 content first.<br />
<br />
Why? Because the people before them did. <br />

<br />
Level 60 raiders had to clear UBRS / Onyxia / MC to gear up for BWL to gear up for AQ20 to gear up for AQ40 / Naxx 40.<br />
<br />
Level 70 raiders had to clear Kara / Gruul / Maggy to gear up for TK / SSC to gear up for BT / MH to gear up for SWP.<br />
<br />
Right now Level 80 raiders have to clear Naxx / OS / EoE to gear up for Ulduar.<br />

When 3.2 hits Level 80 raiders clear heroics for Argent Tournament, skipping 2 tiers.<br />

<br />
Don't be an ignorant tool. Just because you've been raiding for several months, doesn't make you &quot;good&quot; compared to people that haven't. I know several people that simply don't raid anymore (most have families now) that could still run circles around your so called &quot;goods&quot; any day if they so chose to raid again.<br />
<br />
Who are shortcuts annoying to? The person trying to catch up? Or the person that has some ass-backwards, egotistical look on how everything is &quot;supposed&quot; to be done? It's the latter, which is you.<br />
<br />
You need to realize that Blizzards main goal is to keep people playing, and not appeasing the few people that take this game far too seriously. By forcing Bob to go through tiers of content just to catch up, he's probably going to get frustrated doing so for a multitude of reasons. Trying to find a guild doing older content. Being ridiculed by people like you, etc. Either that, or simply be overwhelmed with the amount of work he needs to put in and not do it at all. <br />
<br />
Another thing you fools fail to realize, is that come next patch, when all these Conquest badges are readily accessible, Conquest will be obsolete. Ask yourself this. If you're the person that likes the challenge, and enjoys the progression of YOUR character.. then why are you concerning yourselves with what played A and B do? If you're so above these &quot;bads&quot; that entitles you to look down on them, then you are obviously in the next tier of raiding, and will be obtaining Triumph badges. While these &quot;bads&quot; are obtaining outdated tier and poorly itemized offset pieces by running heroics.<br />
<br />
Oh but wait, they can get Tier 9 through heroic badges too, right? They sure can. You should do the math and see how long it will take these people to get 2 pieces of Tier 9 (which will be inferior to the Tier 9 tokens that drop out of Colosseum)<br />
<br />
My point? The people whining about this, aren't thinking about the whole picture. This is not gamebreaking. In a nutshell, they are simply bringing the bar up. Instead of starting out with Heroism Badges, you now start out with Conquest badges. They are simply shifting the initial level of progression up a couple notches to promote their content. Get a clue. Hardcore in WoW means 1 thing... &quot;I did it first&quot;.<br />
<br />
And you obviously care enough to write a lengthy post whining about it.<br />

Depends on when you played...for someone who was raiding current tiers, yes, but not someone who was late to the game.

not exactly. there's items for every slot available with badges alone. What's happening is new 80s in quest greens and blues can farm some piss ant heroics, and have the gear to &quot;waltz into&quot; Ulduar and do well, espcially given the continued nerfs in content. Nax/OS/Maly are obsolete, except as a means of farming an extra 20 or so badges per week. <br />
<br />
I think Bliz is shooting themselves in the foot with this approach. I'm probably not going to be waiting in line at midnight when the next Xpac drops. Who gives a rats ass about achievement geek points? Why should I bother doing all the foot work when I can wait a month or 2 and have everything handed to me? It's not like anyone actually stands around looking up everyone's achievements. When some one come running by me with some crazy glowing weapon of ultimate death... that's what catches my attention. Or maybe some hidieously ugly shoulders or something. Titles all blend in with guild and player names. Pets are pointless. How many mounts do people really need?<br />

Kind of pissed off, because I was one of the first to get it on my server, and tamed him three hours after the news came out. I competed with no huners, and there was no real strategy to tame him, so I spent two hours of trial and error between how long to wait on wyvern, what percentage to get him at, and if haste was a factor. I was amazed when I got him, and felt like I really accomplished something that took me alot of work.<br />
<br />

If he works hard then he'll be able to raid with John. There are people still running Naxx with mains and alts; there would still be if 3.2 didn't make it pointless (1 naxx 10-man or 3 heroics, seriously...).<br />
John would be getting that regardless. Bob is getting a boost from Blizzard <br />
Going through Naxx isn't a punishment. 99% of people in Ulduar had to do it. Why shouldn't he? &quot;Because it's old&quot; has never been an excuse before but apparently now it is.<br />
<br />
<br />
So riddle me this, sparky: If you, who has worked SO hard to get your gear decide to run a Naxx10 pug, and a fresh 80 who is decked out in blues asks to come, are you going to be the type of retard that says &quot;this is a geared run&quot; or &quot;your gear sux&quot; or some shit? Or are you going to take them?<br />
<br />
You see, people like you have this awesome cyclic argument. There are SO many idiots that demand people go through the same experiences you have, yet don't take people on lower-tier raid content precisely because they lack the gear you do. It's stupid and this is the situation that Blizzard has recognised a large amount of their player base is in.<br />
<br />
Case in point - my druid is running Ulduar with guild. But my mage alt, who has all the BiS pre-naxx heroic items + emblem gear + enchants + appropriate gemming cannot get a Naxx10 run because every retard says I'm under geared. After literally 2 months of trying, I get into a Naxx10 raid the other day and only because I begged. The only people who out dps'd me were the conq geared locks. <br />
<br />
Now I have 1700+ sp and most still won't take me (I won 3 pieces of Naxx10 gear). Instead they prefer to take the 2k geared mages that don't need the gear because &quot;it's a fast run&quot;.<br />
<br />
I pay as much as anyone else to play this game. I have a char that is doing Uld. I know the fights for Naxx10. I'm more geared than any mage I ran Naxx10 with on my druid. I can pull more dps on my mage than ANYONE I ran Naxx10 with on my Druid. Thankfully, Blizzard has put a bit more thought into how they can help people in my situation. Thankfully, people like you aren't running the game, because you can be damn well sure that it wouldn't be nearly the success it is if you were. Why? You're an idiot.</div></div><hr />

Truth. My hunt was able to get a run with my guild who were in all blues at the time since it was the beginning of WoTLK. I steadily got gear there, and now I do Ulduar thanks to that. But my ele shaman, who has the heroic + badge gear, has NEVER gotten a run, and I try every week. I can pull more DPS than many of the epicc'd people there, but I'm told I'm undergeared for just Naxx 10. So instead, they're going to disenchant the gear I need because they're too elitist not to give me a chance.<br />

The worgen should not technically belong to any of the pet families and was therefore removed. This means the pet no longer has access to pet talents or abilities. Whether or not similar circumstances with hunter pets in the past have occurred isn't really relevant. Given the nature of the creature that was tamed in this case, we feel it should not belong to any of the eligible pet families from which a hunter can choose his or her combat companion.</div></div><hr />

Once again read it, they didn't want him to ever be tamed so they are making sure that those that have it will either choose to perma stable it or having the pet run away from not being fed so they lose the pet.</div></div><hr />

After literally 2 months of trying, I get into a Naxx10 raid the other day and only because I begged. The only people who out dps'd me were the conq geared locks. <br />
<br />
Now I have 1700+ sp and most still won't take me (I won 3 pieces of Naxx10 gear). Instead they prefer to take the 2k geared mages that don't need the gear because &quot;it's a fast run&quot;.<br />
<br />
I pay as much as anyone else to play this game. I have a char that is doing Uld. I know the fights for Naxx10. I'm more geared than any mage I ran Naxx10 with on my druid. I can pull more dps on my mage than ANYONE I ran Naxx10 with on my Druid. Thankfully, Blizzard has put a bit more thought into how they can help people in my situation. Thankfully, people like you aren't running the game, because you can be damn well sure that it wouldn't be nearly the success it is if you were. Why? You're an idiot.<br />

* 0. Petition: Worgen pets restoration 07/08/2009 06:32:30 AM PDT<br />
<br />
Seeing my original post got deleted on the Customer Service forum within 2 minutes.... I'll try once here see if it's deleted. Before I paste my original post however, I read the post re: Worgen as a playable and while that holds a little water for me... they'd have to make the Worgen another hero class rather than choosing &quot;warrior, shaman, shadowmage,etc&quot; as classes.... as well as, they'd have to either have humanoid and worgen form, or they'd have to have a travel presence instead of a mount... for flying I'm not sure what we'd do.... maybe a flying disc or something to stand on. I support removing Worgen _IF_ Worgen are becoming a new playable... as long as Worgen are done right.... fist weapons only perhaps, and the ability to imbue your weapons similarly to Runeforging... but I get off topic<br />
<br />
I'm a shaman, I'm petitioning for the Hunter class to restore their Worgen pet. Any hunter who has already tamed this pet should indeed be allowed to keep it as a viable usable pet as was done with any and all other &quot;limited time tames&quot; in the game.<br />
<br />
Ghostwolf - Originally labelled the &quot;Grimtotem Spirit Guide&quot;, this pet was summoned by a hostile mob and lived for 8 seconds (Tame Pet cast time is 20 secs). After several weeks of hunters frantically buying gear, recruiting friends (namely a shaman and a LWer if they were not one) to tame this elusive unique pet Blizzard decided to fix their mistake after being quoted that they were going to leave the Ghostwolf alone as a tamable pet. A brief hotfix removed the Grimtotem Spirit Guides from the game, HOWEVER hunters who had already spent the time to tame these pets were allowed to keep them.<br />
<br />
Hawkbane - Hawkbane was a little known about white tiger available from the start of Burning Crusade only until patch 2.1 when he was removed from the game. Blizzard never explained why this npc was removed from the game, although it's theorized that the revamp of Skettis conflicted with it's spawn points. Hunters were allowed to keep this pet, but the skin is not unique and shared by 2 other cat npcs.<br />
<br />
Death Ravager - This unique ravager skin is summoned from a level 10 Warrior quest, Alliance side. Another summoned beast that Blizzard has allowed to keep despite odd behaviors such as the hunter being the only person able to heal him, and sometimes glitchy pvp behavior. Despite these bugs, Hunters who tamed Death Ravager are allowed to keep him to this day, and Blizzard has not fixed the bugs related to him whereas he was never intended as a pet.<br />
<br />
Hunting Windroc - These strange behaving birds were abundant in Nagrand shortly after Burning Crusade's launch and would 'randomly' dive-bomb talbuks. Sometime before patch 2.3 these birds were removed from the game in a similar fashion as Hawkbane, with no explanation given. Also like Hawkbane, thankfully there are other brown and black owl skins available at the moment.<br />
<br />
Amongst the changes to Dustwallow Marsh it should also be mentioned that a number of normal pets were fully removed from the game. Any owners of the original tames were allowed to keep these as well.<br />
<br />
On the appropriate PTR the Amani Warbear was tamable, although when the patch went live the beast was not. This skin is not that far removed from the Shattered Hand Warhound which also has the saddle and bags and such, but is tamable by any hunter that wishes to get one.<br />
<br />
Torgos, a green carrion bird was tamable on the Burning Crusade beta, although was removed for seemingly no reason while regular carrion in the area are still tamable to this day.<br />
<br />
Though kind of a silly concept, worth mentioning none the less is the Arctic Grizzly Cub in Dragonblight was tamable during the Lich King beta, but was also removed when the game launched.<br />
<br />
These 3 while tamable at one point, were removed taking their unique skins with them.<br />
<br />
Sandfury Guardian - These green snakes were originally removed from the Hunter 'tame' list, but then readded. Previous to patch 1.3 these snakes were considered 'Wind Serpents' and were tamable, although were quickly removed only to be readded as a tamable pet with patch 2.0. The original skills had changed, though the pet was tamable again. Hunters who had tamed him back before patch 1.3 were allowed to keep him throughout it's removal from being a pet.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has also allowed hunters to keep other previously &quot;oopsed&quot; pets that were originally not designed to be tamed. Two examples of this are both &quot;Crocolisks&quot; by nature. The ghostly hydra that is summoned during the Oracles dailies was originally tamable, although with patch 3.0.8 he was removed from being tamable and once again hunters were allowed to keep him. Also related to the hydra would be the albino crocolisk who also previous to patch 3.0.8 was tamable, was patched in 3.0.8 to not allow him to be tamed and hunters who had him were allowed to keep him. Both of these pets had their skins removed from hunter options with these changes and are no longer available in any way for hunter pets.<br />
<br />
Final example of a pet that should never be allowed, although has been permitted to be kept, was strangely enough another Oracles dailies quest mob that also behaves as a Crocolisk. Previous to patch 3.0.8 hunters could tame a slime... yes a SLIME as a pet. This Slime has the classic green bubbling skin with the skull inside and weapons and such sticking out of him, but behaves as a crocolisk does. After patch 3.0.8 hunters were allowed to keep this pet for some reason, but no further tames were allowed.<br />
<br />
All of this needed to be pointed out before making a valid argument for Hunter Worgen pets.<br />
<br />
Many times in the past, Blizzard has either quietly patched in a pet to allow players some variety and some scouting for viable options in search of that one pet that will set them aside from everyone else, or has simply slipped up and forgot to encode something and players benefitted from a unique pet because of it. Over the last week there has been a large number of hunters out in Howling Fjord taming this unique 'Worg', ok his skin isn't a classic worg, but he 'behaves and reacts exactly as a' worg does which in turn makes him a worg. There was a blue post a few days ago made stating that Blizzard was intending to remove the Worg-en from being tamed during patch 3.2 but was swiftly deleted and now the hunter community knows why.<br />
<br />
Unlike every other pet that Blizzard has implemented then removed, the Worgen has lost it's skills, talent tree, and has been removed from 'valid pet mechanics'. Even the Serpent before 2.0 was still a pet, though couldn't be fed so was rarely used for fear of it abandoning it's master. Blizzard has removed the Worgen from new tames but has also robbed hunters who have already tamed him and in some cases having already abandoning other retired pets to obtain him.<br />
<br />
Blizzard, will you restore abandoned pets to these hunters if they ask?<br />
<br />
Likely the answer to this is no, as abandoning a pet is a player controlled action, but abandoning a pet to tame another then having that pet removed still has you left with no pet and is arguably not your fault that you have no pet.<br />
<br />
The largest argument against Worgen as hunter pets have been that they are sentient beings, therefore would rebel from the taming and wouldn't allow anyone to tame or control them.<br />
Exhibit A: Loque'nahak - the mate to a God. First off, this beast is the mate to a sentient talking Snow Leopard... what validation is there in saying that this beast, or it's mate would allow you to live while taming, or trying to control it.<br />
<br />
&quot;But but Worgen are humanoids&quot;<br />
Ordinarily yes, but in the case of Garwal you're wrong. Garwal when tamed is considered a beast, a wolf specifically and reacts, talents, growls, etc all exactly like a wolf. The fact that he is displayed with armor is irrelevent.<br />
<br />
&quot;But Worgen aren't from Azeroth, how can they be a pet&quot;<br />
Neither are warlock pets, and arguably ghouls but yet they are allowed due to class mechanics. Hunters have the exception where they can choose what they befriend which honestly should have been the case with warlocks....<br />
<br />
&quot;But Worgen are sentient! Srsly!!&quot;<br />
And how is a bubbling muck, a puddle of ooze, a SLIME tamable and controllable by a hunter? How does a hunter control a creature that simply reacts on base impulses in the same way that a bloodthirsty cursed creature such as the worg would?<br />
<br />
Quite simply, there is no validation in the removal of the Worgen as a pet beyond &quot;It's our game we'll do it if we want to&quot;. The evidence is here to defend the hunters and to allow them to keep their Worgen pet as a full viable pet option. The only time that a pet has been removed and permanently stabled has had the pet readded at the begging request of the community.<br />
<br />
I'm here to petition, it's either the Worgen being readded, or the Slime burried.... you cannot validate removing the Worgen without addressing the similar argument behind the Slime 'crocolisk'.<br />
<br />
Slime - Behaves, talents, and skills as a crocolisk<br />
Worgen - Behaves, talents, and skills as a worg/wolf.&quot;<br />

My brain is arguing over this one<br />
<br />
1 - It's a frikking skin, wtf is the big deal? - either way - for Bliz, or Hunters.<br />
<br />
2 - As pointed out in the above post, it's happened before and this worgen is the first to get skrood over like this.<br />
<br />
I have one, and I'm keeping it. I spent 50g for a respec and I threw away a L80 pet, and spent like 4 hours trying to tame him in bewteen lots of other hunters that came and went. It was a pretty epic tame, because of the split second timing required, and there was no formula to follow because everyone has a different haste rating and Wyvern damage ticks. If history repeats itself, the worgen will be back sooner or later. At the very least I can scare old ladies with it by taking him out for a quick stroll once a month or so. Hell, I have a useless Devilsaur stuck in my stable as well from when I expirimented with BM. He can't get out unless I respec, and BM sux so it would just be to release him anyway. I'd rather lose the stable slot than spend 100g to spec into BM and then out of it again. Luckily hunters only need one stable slot atm anyway, just to switch bewteen the PvE mandatory wolf type (that every hunter in the universe has), and the PvP pet of choice. It's not like any other pets are useful in any way.</div></div><hr />

Keep it, Blizzard isn't making you get rid of it, just don't expect to put talents into it. It was never intended to be tamed because it's a humanoid, not a simple beast. Unlike every other pet in the past, this one is intelligent and sapient as well as sentient.</div></div><hr />

I just posted this on Official EU (read ignored for the most by Blizzard), see how long it stays up and if I get banned.<br />

# So, I'd like my pet back please<br />
<br />
Yup, I had to abandon a pet to get the pet who's name we can't mention because certain people who ahem, work around here seem to be going on a banning spree because they feel this issue it a sore point (Wonder why that is...)<br />
<br />
So, should I choose to do so, and being as you give us little choice because of the manner you handled this situation, if I abandon the pet who's name we can't mention would you give me back the pet I had to abandon to get it, in fact could you?<br />
<br />
As it stands I lost out on one pet to tame another, now you rendered that pet useless when it was in fact a proper Hunters pet with abilities and talents when I got it, because I got it for those once it came out you could get it. Yes I made a choice to do so, but so did you when you decided to castrate this pet in the way you did in such haste it cannot have been properly thought out.<br />
<br />
Before the whole &quot;it was this or that and blah blah&quot; tirade of if it was a mistake, a bug or an exploit starts, the point is most if not all hunters who took this pet only did so because of how the majority of other pets that came about like this did by someone seeing a chance to gain something unusual rather than for any malicious of game breaking reasons or exploits. You encourage players to be creative and look for the unusual, such as Rare creatures and the like. Most Hunters played along with that especially with the previous unusual pets that have been introduced into the game and the way they were handled, they obviously thought that this one was going to be dealt with in the same manner.<br />
<br />
None of the current reasons given why we can't have the pet stand to reason, lore, please Cows from Space figured right into WoW lore, right? Can't tame Humanoids, where do Ghouls come from Mummy? Wasn't meant to be tamed, your mistake, your fault, don't be peevish about Hunters using their initiative when you encourage us to do so and seek out rare or exotic pets.<br />
<br />
Now you have not played it the way you previously have done and chose to go a whole different route some of us have lost a &quot;working&quot; pet a gained something that isn't even a vanity pet because we are penalised if we keep it because we lose a pet stable slot and have to go to strange lengths to keep it happy, can't use it to Hunt with so it's not a &quot;working&quot; pet. Add to that the cash many of us spent to respec to capture &quot;it&quot;, as well as the time taken to Tame &quot;It&quot;.<br />
<br />
Yes, it is your game and you will do as you see fit, we as paying customers are VERY aware of that, you show us often enough. Considering that Blue posts about this vanished which stated the pet wasn't getting touched till the next patch (More than a few sources state this and witnessed the posts for it to be just crap) the way you handled this situation is utterly shocking and I as a paying customer am disgusted something so fundamentally trivial as this in the grand scheme of things was dealt with so quickly when this game has MASSES of far more pressing issues deserving of immediate attention that get left for months and months without so much as a hotfix. We get fobbed off with the usual &quot;The Devs are aware of this issue and it is being looked into, thank you for making us aware of this!&quot; generic flannel.<br />
<br />
However, I as a paying customer have the right to air my views (yes here in public because that is what these forums are for - and if not a Blue response with the correct place or E-Mail address where I can do so would be appreciated) and also as I feel like I have had my gameplay affected I want something to be righted which you wronged. More importantly I am disgusted at how the money you take from me every month is being spent when this kind of thing shows such flagrant misuse of Dev/Coders time fixing something minor when larger issues are just left to fester for long periods of time.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, the bottom line is, take the pet that shall not be named away, give me my old Pet back and I also want my Talent Point respec costs covering, I'll let you off with the time I spent getting the pet as I got it rather fast and didn't waste much time from my usual daily gaming, thanks muchly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
blah blah blah... same rhetoric<br />
<br />
it isn't intelligent, sentient, sapient or anything else... it's a video game mob, that behaves like a wolf, that happened to be tamable. These arguments are all a bunch of crap. Every player has access to a pet &quot;Orphan&quot; or &quot;Squire&quot;... actual children as pets--that's way worse than a werewolf. The only thing that mattered to any hunter was the appearance. The most viable PvE pet we have right now is a wolf. Every SV and MM raiding hunter is using a wolf. A lot of BM hunters are even using wolves, because the Devilsaur is too irritating to be worth the marginal DPS gain over the wolf.<br />
<br />
That's what the outcry is about... no one really gave a rats ass about the other pets like the slime or hydra... because they were just mostly vanity pets anyway because crocolisks suck.<br />
<br />
For 1 brief shining night there was a chance to get a rare looking pet, that could actually be used on a regular basis to raid with. Now for all of the dumb ass reasons about walking on 2 legs, and looking like a humanoid race and whatever else all the detractors have speculated about.. it's gone. Now every hunter is back to using the same wolves every other hunter has.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is rather than fix the pet to take away whatever amazing OP advantage it had, that Blizz was sooo concerned about, they chose to make the pet worthless. If Blizz would quit farting around with beasts and program them right the first time, then hunters wouldn't get their hopes up every time a new creature pops up. How hard would it be to make the special creatures out there elite? Then Bliz could make them do whatever they want, and then when they got tamed they'd lose their elite status, and revert to a normal version of the pet with the same skin.<br />
<br />
It's all a load of crap, and really nothing worth crying about. Just another slip up by Blizz and a half-fast fix.</div></div><hr />
