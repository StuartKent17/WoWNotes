Worldwide Invitational - Extra Pictures<br />
I've got quite a few pictures of the WWI and didn't have time to post most of them during the week end. I would also like to thanks Stephan Zipperlen / Korred (http://www.f60-design.de/) who did the photo coverage for us during the event. <br />

Let's see. She plays WoW (+1), she's good looking (+2), she's very good at WoW (+1). I see nothing wrong about finding her attractive. I'm also very doubtful she or most of the people in Nihilum play all day. The best guilds tend to play only very hardcore when it counts, it's the &quot;sucks&quot; that must play constantly to get over their bad organization and lack of skill.</div></div><hr />

Very little was actually revealed and many no details given on how they are actually gonna make it all work. Lets take retribution paladins for example. THey can say this and that about them getting same items as DPS warriors and DK. But there was no info how and many players are very sceptic on these comments. Specially considering what has already been said for 2 years now - who is in charge and how that person is gonna make sure that even DPS warriors will be able to tank heroics while tending to a dps class that has no role. <br />
<br />
BTW - the msg from Blizzard for Retris was - Kick them out of raid ! It seems like the same goes for holy palas to.</div></div><hr />

I watched em live.. so I didn't have the need to look for them.. There were quite a few people filming, so maybe they aren't posted yet.

<br />
<br />
Both were female. I saw the Starcraft (not familiar with it so I've no idea what she was supposed to be) one out of costume (just had her hair done up).<br />
<br />
There were several official costumed folks. All female except for someone dressed sort of like death (may have been female but I don't think so). A couple of Jaina Proudmore lookalikes, 2 BloodElfs, the Starcraft and the Night Elf.<br />
<br />
The costume someone posted of a guy with long black hair was supposed to be Shade of Aran (haven't seen it in game so not sure how accurate it is)<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/june/wwi/wwi-3.jpg<br />
<br />
The crowds went wild everytime the Murloc came out (Even when he appeared at closing with L80ETC doing I am Murloc) but the tauren costume that won looked good.<br />
<br />
As to the dancer who did the Human Dance (2nd place) I think he should have won (i'd suggest he may be a trained dancer). Was definitely better than the 1st place. There was a really good nightelf male dance but he elaborated and did moonwalks in it so he probably lost out on that due to accuracy. None of the female dances were really that good.<br />
<br />
The Dance contest had more audience participation than the End show L80ETC and VideoGames Live. Lots of clapping to the music and cheering, really encouraging the dancers.</div></div><hr />

Damia is also female, just for the record.<br />
<br />
Guess their policy changed :p But I like how Chaoswex was like &quot;and someone called Sniffy&quot; when telling who was going to the WWI, looks like most of their IRC staff didden't know she was a girl :D</div></div><hr />

I don't think she's &quot;far from good looking&quot;... She has really nice hair, nice eyes, nice skin, slender.. She's no super model, but pretty darn good looking for a normal girl. However, i would agree... it's better to not have a gf that plays too..<br />
