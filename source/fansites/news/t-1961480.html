Legion - Arcane Mage Artifact Intro<br />
Arcane mages use Violet Hold, Coldarra, and the Nexus during their Artifact acquisition. You can see their weapon models here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/985-Legion-Artifact-Weapons#mage), including the sixth variation (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/february/ArcaneMageArtifactWep06.jpg).<br />

Ashran in Legion<br />
You will queue for Ashran similar to how you queue for battlegrounds. There will be no rewards unique to Ashran in Legion. The Ashran Dominance quest will reward honor and a strongbox similar to those you receive from winning a Battleground.

Queue Times<br />
Can we get faster que timer pops please? waiting 30-45 mins a match just seems nutty<br />
We're working on it. We want faster queues too (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/404061-faster-que-timers-please/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20742605140?page=1#5))<br />

Legion Tuning Hotfix Live at 7pm PST on 3/8<br />
A hotfix has been deployed to Alpha that will have significant impact on damage overall in PvP. Weapon damage, armor and secondary stats were incorrectly set for each class. Weapon damage was set to an extremely high value resulting in too much damage, especially from classes with fast attack speeds. In addition, we initially wanted secondary stats to be evenly distributed so that we can tune each spec appropriately based on feedback. You should now see an equal amount of each secondary stat when in PvP. Finally, armor was set to 4000 for all specializations resulting in some specs having too much armor.<br />
<br />
All of these issues have been fixed in the current version of Alpha. We look forward to hearing your feedback. Thanks!

DoT Spells Interrupting Actions<br />
Currently Dots are breaking Flag Caps and drinks. There is no way this is intended right with Corruption being 60 sec timer on players you can kill a solo defending lock and as long as he had corruption on you no way you are capping the node before he spawns. same thing with drinks you get out of combat to drink and the dots force break drinking I know every healer is going to hate this in arena.<br />
Thanks for the report. Do you know if a specific spell did this to you or have you had this experience with all damage over time effects?

Feral Druid Feedback -- Build 21232 -- 3-Mar<br />
Re: The cooldown on 'powershifting':<br />
<br />
This is indeed a philosophy change from live. Druids have been, and will continue to be, exceptionally good at breaking roots/snares. But that should be tied to shapeshifting, not macroing into skipping the shapeshift. It will provide better counterplay if thereâ€™s some cost (albeit still spammable and small) to shifting out of roots and snares.

Outlaw Rogue Feedback -- Build 21232 -- 3-Mar<br />
In the build after next, you'll find that Roll the Bones rolls 6 dice, instead of 5. That should solve the rerolling-for-5-buffs issue you were discussing.

Mana Tap talent looks exactly like Soulburn Haunt, Improved Soulfire 4.0. An obligatory buff to maintain.<br />
Do you think talents are a good place for gameplay styles that some people enjoy and some people don't? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/704579767786299392))<br />

<br />
Sometimes I find it quite frankly scary how little these blue posters seem to know what they're talking about. For those non-Ferals out there, there IS a design-wise reason why haste sucks for us: our bleeds - which comprise roundabouts half of our entire damage output - do NOT scale with haste. How blizzard can overlook that and simply put it down to tuning, I really can't fathom...</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, those PVP Rooms in the Faction part of the city it should be some Sort of Faction Soldiers Barraks, we could have 1 room with troops that are raning and another where soldiers are chilling, just to keep up the immersion, and maybe we can have come cool and simple Daily quests (Something simple and easy, that would target the other faction inside the Walls of Dalaran, example: steal Items, make Soldiers get Drunk at the bar ECC...), The key is &quot;immersion&quot; make the world feel alive ^^<br />
<br />
Thanks for hearing me out.<br />
<br />
PS: BLIZZARD... A PLAGUE CART INSIDE THE FACTION AREA WITHIN THE CITY OF DALARAN!!!! remove it NOW!!! (if you dont have some plans for it) but hey... a Plague cart inside a Living city is like making a Kindergarden inside a Nuklear Facility.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
Btw, Talking about the Horde Faction Area in dalaran, how about you give us some more Exits to the main city (nothing to special) just some sort of corridors or stairs), I would love to have more small Corridors and smaller rooms around in Dalaran,<br />
<br />
BLizzard you are dong a good job, keep it up, my Ideas are just &quot;fanatic and Warcraft Love&quot; Toughts ^^<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
PS: about the Faction area PVP rooms, dont make more Static portals around (first it destorys Immersion, second it is just poor game design)<br />
<br />
Idea, when we queue for battlegrounds, and we get inn, let us travel to the entrace of the battle ground, so atleast we get a feeling where the battle happens in the World (since we are playing WORLD OF WARCRAFT... and not Portals of Warcraft)<br />
<br />
I would apply this same idea to DUNGEONS, just to make us get more Immersed to the World and where thing is in that WORLD.<br />
<br />
Thanks for understanding.</div></div><hr />
