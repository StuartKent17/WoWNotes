Armory Stats - Artifact Challenge Appearances<br />
Today we are taking a look at the number of characters that have the Artifact Challenge appearance equipped. <br />
<br />
<br />
This data set includes 4.5 million Level 110 characters active in the last month, across the US and EU. <br />
We only considered what artifact appearance a character had equipped when they logged out. <br />
The percentage shown is the percentage of characters that logged out with the listed spec that have the challenge appearance equipped. <br />
We don't have a good way to know if a character has the challenge appearance unlocked unless they have it equipped. <br />
This means that player preference for spec and appearances plays a role in the numbers below and that they don't represent a true comparison of difficulty between the specs. <br />
For example, in terms of absolute numbers, more Havoc Demon Hunter have their challenge appearance equipped than Assassination rogues, but there are many more Havoc Demon Hunter characters than Assassination Rogue characters, making the percentage of characters logged out as that spec lower. <br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
How do you approach the risk that comes with taking away an interaction that players have grew fond of versus the potential gain in game health?<br />
At the end of the day, it’s a cost benefit analysis. How bad is the current state of game health and how likely are you to improve it by taking away the interaction you mention? If you’re going to improve health by 1% but losing the interaction makes players like the game 10% less, then that’s not a trade I would take.<br />
<br />
A really typical situation where this manifests is when the interaction is fun for some players, but part of the reason why it’s fun is because it’s overpowered, hard to counter, or maybe really easy to execute. For the player having fun it feels like you are squashing their fun and they don’t understand what the big deal is. But for other players, the interaction feels like bullshit. <br />
<br />
I don’t mean to imply that players are so shallow that they only enjoy unbalanced things. However, we used to have a saying that anything overpowered is fun. It’s sometimes hard to distinguish whether players are enjoying the cause (the interaction) or the effect (being overpowered).<br />
<br />
All that said, I also try to preach that developers should not stomp on an interaction just because it is unintended. As a developer, it can be easy to reflexively nerf or change something just because players aren’t doing something the way you imagined. But if it’s not actually hurting anything, I’d let them keep doing it. (Source (https://askghostcrawler.tumblr.com/post/160201166408/how-do-you-approach-the-risk-that-comes-with))<br />

I think I would like to see a &quot;Percent of Characters of {Class} with at least one Challenge Appearance&quot; graph. Since the per-spec graph is a bit difficult (I have a challenge appearance that I don't log out in). It might be less precise, but it would provide more accurate data.<br />

We only have 97k characters that have one of the appearance equipped and 120k players that have earned the achievement as of a week ago in our database.

I find it hilarious that people are complaining about catering to the few at the top. I rarely get more than 4-5h of play a week and have not gone into any kind of organised raid content other than a few NM Nighthold runs through the group finder. I've done a few Mythic+ runs but the bulk of the effort has been solo, with some heavy time and WA optimizations.

Cry harder. Not everything has to be open to all players at the same time. In a few months you will be able to roll through it like it was nothing. at 898 holydin I completed it in 8 tries. First 7 tries was just getting past first stage. Once I got past the first stage of it I 1 shotted the rest. I don't like this patch either, but this is stupid to complain about. Just because you aren't good enough to do it doesn't mean Blizzard &quot;caters&quot; to other people.</div></div><hr />

Good to know. At least having the official infographic does help give some amount of estimated upper and lower bounds for how complete your character/player sets are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Amount of players per spec + legendaries, along with skill. Destro is a CC fest that requires more awareness about cast bars than we're used to in raiding/dungeons (see: nowhere near as many pvp players as pve). Aff requires kiting and at least one utility legendary, and if that legendary is the Corruption ring then you just have to worry about staying away from the swordsman and killing the hands after you interrupt them. For me it was Destro &gt; Demo &gt; Aff.</div></div><hr />

Healer specs have the highest average item level. This is because people don't usually play healer specs unless they are a part of an organized raiding group.<br />
<br />
Restoration druid . 878.0<br />
Mistweaver monk ... 876.2<br />
Holy paladin ...... 878.0<br />
Holy priest ....... 875.5<br />
Restoration shaman. 877.0<br />
<br />
The same goes probably with tanks, but the effect is smaller because specs like Blood and Vengeance are also played outside of organized raiding.<br />
<br />
Guardian druid .... 875.2<br />
Brewmaster monk ... 872.6<br />
Protection paladin. 871.2<br />
<br />
Only three DPS specs have average item level over 870. No clue why.<br />
<br />
Balance druid ..... 871.3<br />
Elemental shaman .. 870.8<br />
Affliction warlock. 870.9<br />
<br />
And only two specs have average item level below 860. I know that Feral has AoE problems, but wasn't Outlaw the best rogue spec somewhere in Legion.<br />
<br />
Feral druid ....... 859.4<br />
Outlaw rogue ...... 857.9</div></div><hr />

Nothing more than a gear check especially ones that require you to have specific legendaries.<br />

Honestly, I've only completed the destro lock one. Even if you were 930-940. They still have the one shot mechanic in there. If you continue to miss that, you will die. Same with Aff, that fight is super buggy, but you get literally one shot if you mess up. I don't think a huge ilvl will fix those mechanics.

Average item level data is per character, accounts weren't used to generate those. Assuming we got an item level per account, it would probably be even higher. <br />

<br />
Is it because most destro locks have no interest in the skin? Or is it because the class feels generally easy to play, so people have generally learnt to not rely on things like interrupts/fears much (since destro for example doesn't use felhunter)? I have obtained it and I really like it to be honest. Now trying to win 10 rbgs with it to get the fel version. ^^<br />
<br />
My best guess would be that most warlocks run around etc as affliction, rather than demo or destro.<br />
<br />
I personally completed all three with ~ 10 ilvl less than the average. The only annoying thing about the destro (and demo) one is that they are very reactive, so it took me some time to get used to the timings, as I had no timers from bigwigs.</div></div><hr />

That's not at all what to take from it.<br />
<br />
What to take from it is that the challenge is shoved behind a gear wall that only organised raiders will be able to hurdle. Skill plays no part when the average player is 40 item levels short. What's even more embarrassing for Blizzard is that, with their item-level scaling technology, there was absolutely no reason for it to be this way.<br />
<br />
If skill is the meant to be the barometer, there's no need for a gear wall; yet there it is, to keep people grinding up gear for a bonus artifact skin.<br />

<br />
But the whole gear grind has been a part of the game since the genre's inception. Maybe the challenge does incentivize the whole gear grind, but it certainly isn't the main reason why someone would grind gear. It's just a part of the game, you need gear to progress. <br />
<br />
Obviously gear will trivialize the content, and I don't think that's an issue. You will get it eventually. I personally completed it at 892 ilvl, after many hours and over 100 attempts. I feel like that ilvl is fairly easy to get to without needing to been on an organized raid team.<br />
<br />
I would say skill is the dominate factor with gear eventually overshadowing it as we move through the expansion.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I used no cheap addons either to beat it. I hate using anything else other than dbm and exorsus raid tools for raiding and nothing else. I like to play blindly through the game when my performance won't affect others. I defeated the destro challenge as 889 myself :)<br />

The &quot;average&quot; player being 865-870 isn't that average. I have two characters, one with which the only raiding I did was PUG normal nightholds that's like 902 or 903, which I completed the Artifact Challenge back when I was 895 or so (Ret Paladin), and one character with which I run Mythic+ one night a week, which is 898 or something.<br />
<br />
It's not hard to gear up to the 890s at all, especially with the new rewards for M+. There is no gear wall for this skin, you either are good and you get it, or you're bad and you don't.</div></div><hr />

MMO-C community only makes up a very few percentage of the actual playerbase.

Ontop of that Blizzard went out of their way to make Armory even more difficult to collect data from. Hopefully this was done before the new changes or I'd feel really bad for the person(s) having to manually look at every person with the achievement to see which spec they had it with.<br />

Because Blizzard doesn't care about sub numbers anymore. They probably make more money now with WoW Tokens then they did with subscriptions alone.<br />

They've become a shallow cashgrab of their former self. They'd rather 1 player spend $1000 on the battle.net store than have 50-100 players spend a subscription.</div></div><hr />

You're going to have to eventually stop drinking the Kool-Aid and realize Blizzard does nothing but lie to its customers. It's their standard operating procedure, Trump-style. Anything anyone else reports -- even using their own databases and their own tools -- is &quot;fake news.&quot; Only Blizzard and Blizzard alone knows the truth of all things relating to the game. They tell us so, and you will fucking believe them. They have no reason to make anything up, especially in defense of their shitty implementation and mechanics. And why shouldn't you trust them even with basic database information? They've proven time and time again how flawless their programmers are.

No it's not. Companies just need to stop trying to mimic Blizzard. Blizzard doesn't even understand why WoW became popular, yet all these other companies keep trying to duplicate them despite them getting worse and worse with every expansion. (Case in point is how they misuse the word &quot;expansion.&quot; Blizzard has never created a single expansion for their game. The word &quot;expansion&quot; implies that you're enlarging the game, not shrinking it. Each of their so-called expansions instead shrinks the game by making more and more of itself irrelevant. As of Legion, more than 90% of the game is totally pointless; just five little repetitive zones only a fraction of the size of some of their older ones. Pathetic.)</div></div><hr />

Seriously what a pointless post. Nobody even thinks this is particularly accurate but the chances are that a good enough proportion of people who've done it will have the appearance equipped either for cosmetic reasons, or just to show off, that we can make a reasonable estimate as to the percentage of players who've done it thus far. Still, I guess cheers for pointing out the blindingly obvious there?<br />
<br />
Again it's not a good measurement. Transmog is mainly used for cosmetic reasons and if your class has a subpar challenge one compared to other classes you're simply not gonna use it for transmog.

I'm not interested in whose challenge is easier for the same reason that you're wrong on this - it's subjective. <br />
<br />
Let's go over the areas where you're reaching:<br />
<br />
- 'Appearance X doesn't look good' is very much subjective. Just because you wouldn't use it doesn't mean that others won't.<br />
<br />
- 'People won't ever use a transmog that doesn't look good.' Again, you're generalising from your own experience. Somebody else might value displaying the challenge appearance to show that they've done it over using an appearance that they feel looks better. <br />
<br />
The simple fact is that for myriad reasons, people will use their challenge appearances. Maybe not all people, but the fact that every spec has representation proves this to be the case. <br />
<br />
You've managed to confuse yourself, but I can help. Nobody said that it was a 'good measurement'. it provides an indication, and to that end the method is entirely fit for purpose. By all means, if you have data other than your own personal experience to suggest that spec X or spec Y may be underrepresented due to an overwhelming perception that the appearance is so ugly as to preclude a significant number of players from using it, then go ahead - share it. <br />
<br />
Otherwise, we can see that the data is largely in line with what we would reasonably expect to see. In each of the classes, the completion rate per spec correlates with the proportion of players who are actively using that spec. No surprises there. Tank challenges are known to have tuning issues, and tank representation is lower than any other role, as we would expect. If the aesthetics of a particular appearance were so poor as to dramatically reduce the representation of that particular spec, we would see that effect in the data. We do not, and we can reliably conclude that it is not a significant enough factor to bring into question the veracity of the method as a indication READ: NOT MEASUREMENT of the representation of specs who have completed the challenge relative to one another. <br />
<br />
Tl;dr: You're just straight up wrong. What you think is not at all reflected in the data.<br />
<br />
Subjectiveness has nothing to do with it. If the challenge looked like a piece of turd you still think people would use it equal to other challenge looks just because they have their own taste? In a piece of turd i mean literally as piece of turd if you didn't get it. Some things looks better than others and are therefore more popular. But I guess in your world all transmogs are equally used if you factor out availability.<br />
<br />
Doesn't matter what I think. If a look is very unpopular it will be used as transmog less and will greatly affect the charts. It's a transmog look after all. And no you can't say how much it affects the data in numbers, naturally. you could compare how many has the achievement to how many are using the actual look, but then again there is no way to bind the logged out spec/artifact look to the actual achievement. It's just enough to know it's a factor dismiss &quot;the indication&quot; you are speaking of and say it has to be taken with a huge scoop of salt.<br />
<br />
Speaking of tank challenge. Guardian has much more representation than the other tanks, 2-4 times more. Interesting, why is that? Its the same challenge, and I guess looks has nothing to do with it at all? Guardian is just soo much easier and more powerful than other tanks at high ilvls, right?<br />
<br />
TL;DR nice try</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">barackohmama</div><div class="date">2017-05-16, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're terrible at looking at statistics, but you want to be right so badly that you're willing to ignore all of the facts.<br />
<br />
Before I get to that, I'm going to explain the word 'indication' to you like an idiot, because it's clearly the only way to get it through your skull. <br />
<br />
Indication: Not exact. Gives you an idea of. Doesn't necessarily point to the truth of a thing. For example, your complete failure to understand simple concepts gives me an indication that you're not very bright. That might not be accurate, but the signs point that way. Similarly, unless there's a spec where the numbers are wildly different from the others, we can probably surmise that there are no outside factors which are significant enough to suggest that these numbers don't point us in the general area of the reality of things.<br />
<br />
That brings me neatly onto Guardian Druids. You're right, they are over-represented (albeit at about 2% of the total population vs about 0.6 for the other tank specs, a staggering difference of less than 2%) and that does suggest that something could be different in their case. Spoilers: it's still not the skin. Instead of just guessing like you did, I did some research, and it turns out that on release, Guardian druids could cheese the encounter, which neatly explains the disparity. <br />
<br />
An indication, by its very nature, is to be taken with a pinch of salt. The available evidence, however, would tend to suggest that your assertion that some skins are so ugly that significant numbers of players will not use it, relative to other specs, is either incorrect, or does not apply in enough cases to make a significant enough effect on the data to render it unreliable as a ball-park indicator of numbers. <br />
<br />
So, I've explained Guardian Druids; tell us, wise one, which are these specs whose challenge appearances are stopping huge swathes of players from using them, and what is your evidence?<br />
<br />
You just proved my point. Things like cheesing hugely affects the poll. Therefore the poll is even less an indication of pure difficulty. If you want to know which skins are more popular than others i'm sure you can find that information in a poll somewhere. You still haven't answered why popularity among skins wouldn't affect what skins people are using and therefore also affect the poll in the same matter though. Even if it happends to be a small factor it's still there and have to be taken into account together with all the other things. Including difficulty of course.<br />
<br />
My whole point with my post was that people don't seem to be able to critically evaluate what is presented infront of them. I'm glad you finally did though and therefore you deserve a medal. Most people in this thread are still struggeling with that, therefore i'm done with this thread.</div></div><hr />

Thats why you lash out at the end .<br />
Maybe i completed it yet , you just dont know that do ya ?<br />
I just stated that catering towards a small % of your base isnt alway a good idea .<br />
Your narrow mindedness made it about my skill .Rofl !!:rolleyes:<br />

Again its not about the skill i am talking about .Its about a game that is seeing its sub numbers in free fall .<br />
And in all stubbornness keeps catering towards a tiny selection of its player base .<br />
Is that smart ? It remains to be seen but in my book it can only cost them subs they cant afford losing .<br />
Do things like this at the start of the xp pack so people have all kins of things to do .<br />
Now its just entering content almost none can enjoy . That's dumb .<br />
<br />
In the end, I am the one that is right. The Mage Tower Challenge is balanced around us having ToS level gear. That will be what, 50 ilvls more than we currently have? Making it a walk in the park for A LOT more players.<br />
<br />
And I doubt you got it, to be honest. But feel free to prove me wrong, if it really matters to you.<br />
<br />
.rofl !!:rolleyes:<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, Legion is hardly catering towards the small percentage of playes that are playing for the challenge. It is more about playing a lot and farming, something everyone and their grand-aunt can do if they want to. No skill needed at all. <br />
So I find it fine to have one thing in this game, that really tests our skill. And I wish it would scale with ilvl, making it hard for the rest of the expansion, so we got one item that is extremely hard to obtain that shows how good you are at this game. But nooo, that would be a shame! Everyone needs to be able to obtain it.</div></div><hr />

&quot;I'm having fun, ergo, Blizzard isn't lying about anything!&quot;<br />
<br />
Brilliant fucking logic, kiddo.<br />
<br />
<br />
No it's not. Companies just need to stop trying to mimic Blizzard. Blizzard doesn't even understand why WoW became popular, yet all these other companies keep trying to duplicate them despite them getting worse and worse with every expansion. (Case in point is how they misuse the word &quot;expansion.&quot; Blizzard has never created a single expansion for their game. The word &quot;expansion&quot; implies that you're enlarging the game, not shrinking it. Each of their so-called expansions instead shrinks the game by making more and more of itself irrelevant. As of Legion, more than 90% of the game is totally pointless; just five little repetitive zones only a fraction of the size of some of their older ones. Pathetic.)<br />
<br />
Blizzards idea of expansion differs from other game developers how? Name one expansion for any game that doesn't make the older content less appealing simply because it is new? If you hate WoW you're only making yourself look stupid to continue to play it. If there are so many other games out there that are better then go play those. Lets use a little, maybe a fraction of common sense here. The starting zones are larger in comparison because they were intended to get us from level 1 - 60, why would new zones need to be as large to get us from 90-100, 100-110? That would leave a very large portion of the content unplayed if there were 60 levels worth of content put into an expansion meant to get us only 10 levels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah because we all know all those millions rolling in every month are from the people who &quot;try a bit harder&quot;...But you go ahead and believe what you will. Your money will still be distributed to me with every share I own.</div></div><hr />
