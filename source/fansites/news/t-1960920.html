Legion - Tier 3 BMAH Gear Transmog Restrictions<br />
The developers answered one of the questions about transmogging BMAH gear again (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5500-Eye-of-Azshara-Dalaran-Updates-Wardrobe-System-Class-Updates-Prot-Paladin-Preview#bmah) today.<br />
Tier 3 pieces obtained via the BMAH will have their appearances unlocked account-wide within current transmogrification restrictions. The Frostfire Regalia (www.wowdb.com/item-sets/526-frostfire-regalia) set can be transmogged on a Warlock, for example.

Secondary Stat Scaling in Legion<br />
The thing I realized then is, that a single-stat item has as much stats as an evenly distributed item on the same ilvl, and even more than an unevenly distributed item.<br />
This was originally done to encourage players to diversify secondary stats -- the closer an item was to a single-stat secondary, the more it suffered from this penalty. We reevaluated the method we were doing this by in 6.2, finding that most people were just confused by it and it didn't affect balance in any significant way, so we changed it. Your secondary stat ratings should add up to a consistent value no matter what the combination is from here on out. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/403410-secondary-stat-scaling-in-legion/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20742704730?page=4#62))<br />

Ability Damage in PvP<br />
We've discovered a bug where weapon damage is being calculated incorrectly in our PvP stat templates. A lot of damage is overtuned as a result. We're working on fix it as soon as possible. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/403911-overtuned-abilities/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20742714777?page=2#21))<br />

Ashran in Legion<br />
Level 110 players will be able to queue for Ashran from the UI in Legion. It will work similar to battlegrounds, you can queue with up to 5 players.

[Request] Equal Gear for Factions/Vendor<br />
Can we get a vendor or something so we can have equal gear regaurdless of which faction we choose?<br />
<br />
It's kind of weird how Horde and Alliance Shadow Priests have different gear. Alliance gets the RPPM caster DPS trinket, while horde gets the on-use versatility caster trinket. Not to mention for whatever reason, I have 2% more crit on Horde, but 5% more haste on Alliance before BG scaling.<br />
Are there any other cases of this or just Shadow Priests? (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/403884-request-equal-gear-for-factions-vendor/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20742785047?page=1#2))<br />
<br />
Greatly reduced skill plays?<br />
At least for warrior, there seems to be nothing. No spell reflects, no fear, no intervene. It seems like all of our pvp talents are just &quot;more ways to deal damage&quot; with maybe 2 or 3 exceptions. When I look through other dps classes it seems mostly the same. Most every class has become a gigantic damage bot with little else to offer. Especially from a tournament standpoint it seems like a very *boring* route to take. I dunno. Maybe I'm wrong.<br />
There are some specializations we agree may feel &quot;flat&quot; with lack of utility tools right now on alpha. It would be useful for us to hear which specializations testers feel are in a bad/good/too good spot in that regard (with reasons why). <br />
<br />
While the gameplay of specializations without PvP talents is important, it's most useful to us to hear feedback with full PvP talents. Some specs may feel flat baseline, but with talents feel like they're in a good/too good spot.

Demon Hunters and Flag Carrying<br />
Demon Hunters are able to zoom across the map before it even has time to appear on the mini map. Timed it and it was 23 seconds from point of pick up to capture. Is it worth stunting their mobility like several other abilities while carrying the flag? It isn't fun when the flag is picked up and then captured before you really have time to react.<br />
Agreed. We're making changes very soon. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/403878-demon-hunters-and-flag-carrying/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20742714996?page=1#3))<br />

Discipline Priest Feedback -- Build 21232 -- 3-Mar<br />
Note that AoE damage spells don't (by default) fall off after 6 targets; that's only healing spells. For damage it's a much higher number of targets.<br />
<br />
Correct though, the bulk of the value of Divine Star and Halo is still in the direct healing effect. Their gameplay is still meant to be focused on their use as healing spells when it comes to aiming/positioning.

Outlaw Rogue Feedback -- Build 21232 -- 3-Mar<br />
Do we have everything available to us atm? I miss a few of the &quot;combat&quot; spec had. As far as lvling goes and using Roll the Bones, its fun in the world, but i can see where it will be a hinder in a raid environment, to busy seeing what buff you got (miss an interrupt, stand in some poo, ect).<br />
The intention is not for you to keep fishing for the lucky 5-buff Roll the Bones. If you have theorycraft indicating that it's optimal to keep using Roll the Bones, when you already have a buff (apart from the Health one), we'd love to review that.

Demonology Warlock Feedback -- Build 21232 -- 3-Mar<br />
I havent seen anyone talk about this but it seems that the dreadstalker imps are hitting significantly harder then imps summoned from impending doom and hand of guldan. Also they are not scaling with the infernal furnace tallent. <br />
The Dreadstalker riders should 100% count the same as, and deal the same damage as, regular wild imps. There are just likely some bugs with that.

You're joking right? Bladestorm has never looked so good lol. And to think that you picked that spell to be the &quot;main offender&quot; is just plain stupid. The main offender of these spells should be &quot;Avatar&quot;.. Look.. now you actually look like a blue avatar.. xD</div></div><hr />

No the bladestorm looks horrible... those daggers just appear, and wth... daggers??? its a warrior not a rogue fan of knives.<br />

The old bladestorm was much better, it merely showed a red whirlwind to emphazise the storm... not some silly daggers appearing out of nowhere.<br />
<br />
I Don't think that this 'new' Bladestorm animation is final. It's a re-use and not on par with the much better looking Whirlwind.</div></div><hr />

The developers finally answered one of the questions about transmogging BMAH gear today&quot;<br />
<br />
have you been asleep comrade chaud? They confirmed this some weeks ago again. (I was one of the posters the blue quoted!)<br />

sorryforbeingpicky. :(<br />
<br />
They very funny part is that I have been asking some very legitimate transmog questions on twitter for weeks and all that every gets any mention is about the T3 gear which maybe .005% of the player base has either earned or purchased.</div></div><hr />

There is an awful simple solution to that: Implement personal loot retroactively in old content. Problem solved.</div></div><hr />

Bladestorm has never looked so good lol. And to think that you picked that spell to be the &quot;main offender&quot; is just plain stupid. The main offender of these spells should be &quot;Avatar&quot;.. Look.. now you actually look like a blue avatar.. xD<br />
<br />
As Otaka said, it looks like FoK and it's so over the top. The ability is you swirling around with your weapon, where the hell did all the knives come from. And while Avatar looks strange, it still looks better than what we have currently. I like the added graphics to make swings look heavier, but I'm not entirely sold overall. Maybe it will grow on me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would also like to know. Why do they prevent us to unlock things when it's bound. If anyone can unlock all, there is no &quot;favored plate&quot;. Also, if someone wants to steal a model (needing an item without wanting to use it), he WILL do it regardless of any rules, on his alt. We need the answer.<br />
<br />
All it does is forcing us to play alts to make our main char more progressed in his collections.</div></div><hr />

If your main is a clothy, why do you want all the plate unlocks with him?<br />
<br />
Other than that, their answer is probably the same as to the questions &quot;Why isn't reputation account-wide?&quot; or &quot;Why can't I mail last season's epics to my alt?&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Simple : I want to unlock the plate to increase the transmog counter. For my collection. Just like we're collecting mount and pets, they presented the system as a collecting system.<br />
<br />
As for their answer, I really don't know, why is rep acc wide, well because you're supposed to have a main and progression tied to it, just like you're supposed to complete a collection on your main. Sure alts helps farming mounts, but having transmog unlocking tied to armor type is just like them saying : okay, only the night elf can unlock the tiger in the mount tab, only dwarf can unlock ram and so on. Makes no sense. You unlock all mounts for all char regardless of race. So you should unlock transmog with no restriction (obviously transmog rules still apply).<br />
<br />
Else you don't call that an account wide collection system.</div></div><hr />

So you're obsessed enough to want that 1077/1077 on your interface, but not obsessed enough to have every class at max level anyways?</div></div><hr />

Big up for the Charge/Pummel animation. That shoulder-kick move is very realistic.</div></div><hr />

You're right - it didn't. It's a common misconception that the original Tier3 had class restrictions. Only the ring did because it was a boss drop. The quest could only be aquired per class, but the items did not have restrictions.</div></div><hr />

Come on, all animations looked cool, but this one is silly and over the top. Aside of that, Avatar and Commanding Shout are made of blue (so much blue!) and perhaps they could give Enraged Regeneration a little more visibility... but no biggie. Just get rid of the &quot;blades&quot; in Bladestorm... there are enough blades with our weapons alone, thank you! :P</div></div><hr />

I like it, but it would make more sense if they blades were magically summoned and then dispersed instead of coming in and out of the skeletons center point. I am no doctor but i think that would kill someone lol.</div></div><hr />

Yes I like to collect all, and I'd like to do it with my main char. Not everyone are into alts. I'd like to have all char maxed for the achi though, but the main problem here is having to grind loremaster multiple time to unlock all which is silly. Now that's an extreme alt playstyle, and hard to understand from Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Bladestorm really needs work. It actually almost looks like fan of knives and it makes no sense to be on a warrior's arsenal.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guardian_titan</div><div class="date">2016-03-08, 08:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why would you need to do loremaster on alts to unlock everything? First toon can do loremaster and unlock a good chunk. Every toon after can do selective quests to unlock things. And many pieces have the same look so even if a quest rewards it, you might find the same look from a BoE off the AH or from the salvage yard. So questing isn't required for everything.<br />
<br />
You only really need 4 classes to unlock everything. Warrior can unlock pretty much every weapon and the plate. Hunter for the bows/guns/crossbows and mail pieces. Any leather wearer for the leather although need a demon hunter for warglaives. And then pretty much any of the cloth wearers for any cloth. You don't need to do loremaster 12 times to unlock everything. There's very little that's class specific while leveling. Only thing that's really class specific is tier and even a good many of those have non-class lookalike sets. Earlier sets don't really have them, but later ones often do. So again, why would you need a lot of max alts? You can do it with 4.<br />
<br />
Can't say I like the restrictions since I have some items like a BoP epic cloth chest on my rogue that I got in Sunken Temple I likely won't be able to unlock as a result, though. I can understand restrictions to transmog to an item, but to unlock it? If it is bound it to us, it should be unlocked. BoEs would have to be equipped to unlock.</div></div><hr />

Could a solution be to use the skin of the quipped weapon (and maybe reduce de number of weapons turning around the character to make it more clear) ?<br />
Some RPG provide spells in this spirit. <br />

But maybe the technicality behind it is too high.</div></div><hr />
