If you ever wondered if you suck more than that other guy in your raid, or if your spec is just slightly underpowered compared to his on the boss you're currently fighting, RaidBots.com (http://raidbots.com/dpsbot/)'s statistics is probably the answer to your questions!<br />
<br />
It features spec scores and DPS stats for all classes in the game based on WorldofLogs (http://worldoflogs.com/) parses and it should help you get an idea of how you're supposed to perform. You can also filter stats by boss/instance/difficulty through the menu on the right and if you're a little desperate, it might be an interesting way to know which classes you want to stack to defeat a specific boss ... but please don't hate me for saying that. <br />
<br />
The picture below is the current ranking of classes in 25-Man heroic mode, keep in mind that guilds are still working on those bosses and it will take a few more weeks for them to stabilize. And yes, the mages going up to 52000 DPS is most likely a bug from the Alysrazor fight, but I'm going to point it out just in case. <br />

Masterwork Elementium Deathblade (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/70164/masterwork-elementium-deathblade/) changed to 3.5 Speed<br />
The reason for this confusion stemmed from a quirk in the way item hotfixes have to be applied, unfortunately. We hope to have the item's data completely corrected soon so others are not caught off guard by what the tooltip currently states.<br />
<br />
Yes, obviously Blizzard needs to fix the tooltip on the pattern and the item if they're not going to just make it 3.80 like it ought to be. But, I think the real question ought to be:<br />
<br />
Why isn't it 3.80 anyway?<br />
At 3.80 speed, the weapon was over-performing relative to its cost and the ease with which it can be obtained. <br />
<br />
[...] We wanted this weapon to be roughly on par with weapons from the previous tier, since it can be purchased from the Auction House. It wasn't intended to compete as much with current raid drops, as it felt weird that a strength-based DPS crafted weapon was more attractive than some of its counterparts.<br />

Hmm, I'm not really sure it's the same thing. This 3.50 change wasn't changed like... today. It's been 3.5 since before the patch launched, the tooltip was sadly just bugged. So it's a bug, not really a change. But I guess we'll see where they go with it, my guess is not much.</div></div><hr />

Sub can do good btw<br />
<br />
The people that can play it?<br />
<br />
Yeah they can play it VERY well, Sub isn't exactly ''the pvp'' spec but it is the prefered spec; It can be used in pvE and the people that play it can do good as well and in addition it can be better then both combat / assassination depending on the encounter and of course<br />
<br />
The player itself<br />

Id assume its Alysrazor. hard cast pyroblast, then cast combustion to hit the two adds that channel=400K DPS<br />
At least, Id assume so</div></div><hr />

<br />
you assume they dont have this data (or better data). they aren't as worried about certain specs sucking compared to others. dks are not in bad shape, just unholy is. but as you can see frost is up with rest of the dps. That's not as big as say shaman in generla always being on bottom, but the recent hotfix shows they acknowledged that much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In that case, please read(and its references) for clarity regarding my argument on this topic: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2878698161?page=19#363<br />
<br />
I was one of the first few people to access new BS recipes(I raced for 1H axes for myself) on my server, however, to my knowledge the correct tooltip was only displayed in Wowhead's database, and the clarity on weapon's performance was only available when one of them was crafted and equipped, resulting in the player seeing the weapon having a base speed of 3.50 rather than 3.80(The tooltip for both recipe and the weapon is still not fixed as of the last hour) upon checking their stats window.<br />
<br />
In the end, this is a bigger mistake on a smaller scale on Blizzard's side(compared to 371-honor gear incident), hope they attempt for a form of compensation as they did with the 4k honor compensation(I have offered solutions in the official forum, check the link if you want), and hope they don't repeat such mistakes again, as they are getting their credibility getting hurt little by little through such things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
...and first(for the first time) :)To my knowledge the wep was 3.5 on the PTR but somehow made it to live with bugged tooltip. It still acted as a 3.5 speed with lower DMG than 3.8 etc. So people who have it already won't really notice DPS change.<br />

Nothing is wrong with him - i can understand his point. Shaman and Paladins are a hybrid class - Blizzard in the past stated that hybrid classes should be 3%-5% lower in DPS as pure DPS classes.

<br />
1. the only subpar dps spec was unholy, and they did buff unholy in 4.2, notice how the line goes up.<br />
<br />
2. blizz doesn't balance the game around what the 100 best cases ever in the history of the world accomplished<br />
<br />
3. gl getting a blue response on mmo-champ lawl<br />

Shaman and Paladins are a hybrid class - Blizzard in the past stated that hybrid classes should be 3%-5% lower in DPS as pure DPS classes. I exchanged versatility for DPS by choosing a pure DPS class. If i could i would roll a hybrid but 6 years playing rogue that attached me to my class.<br />
<br />
3 hybrid classes performing way better as rogues and that's sad.<br />
<br />
I logged in just to stop you right their. Blizz went back on that a LOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG time ago. You can stop this stupid little fantasy you got in your head that your rogue should be topping hybrids. <br />
<br />
What healing is a Ret Paladin, Feral Druid, Enchancment Shaman going to do in a 25 man heroic raid? None.<br />
How long is a Ret Paladin or a Frost DK going to tank a 25 Heroic boss? A lot less than a rogue can with Evasion<br />
<br />
The utility that hybrid classes bring is nothing anymore except for CC. The ONLY thing that matters if your DPS is DPS. Rogues have fare far utility than most hybrid classes in 25 man raids, so by your incredibly stupid logic they should have less DPS than a Ret Paladin. <br />
<br />
Stop spreading this retarded bullshit propaganda that Blizz wants hybrids to be lower than non hybrids because they changed their mind on that before WotLK. Nobody believes you except for yourself and you sound like a stupid asshole.</div></div><hr />

Here's a chart from Heroic Baleroc, a single-target fight where the numbers will make a lot more sense to most people. Since only the top few guilds have contributed H-Baleroc parses, the numbers should also be free of the &quot;derp&quot; factor.<br />

Other specs do not appear in the top 100 H-Baleroc parses.<br />

That list makes a good bit more sense, classes with shitty movement, or target switching, slightly outperform the rest on a patchwerk fight, with everyone else pretty much equal. 8% variance between specs is pretty rock solid balance.</div></div><hr />

*Of course* it is. That's why you never see anyone, particularily top guilds who are most aware of the optimal raid compositions, bring any rogues or hunters to their raids, never, ever.<br />
<br />
Because clearly *each and every* raid member should be able to off-tank, off-heal or both at a moment's notice. I mean, how can you even consider raiding without that?</div></div><hr />

lol. You must not pvp much eh? The reason feral is currently fotm has nothing to do how much dps they do. What matters is how they do it. Bleeds are the problem. They're undispellable, unresistable, and unmitigated by armor. Since ferals derive a far higher portion of their dps from bleeds than any other spec it can create problems.</div></div><hr />

We run a 10 man raid ... and our hybrid can and have to heal/dps dps/tank ... we do not have a big player pool - so our hybrids have to fit in other roles and they do. It is easier to get a good DPS random player as a healer or a tank.<br />

<br />
The numbers in the front page are the median of the top 100 logs of each of the first 6 fights in firelands, meaning the sample is made of 600 logs of 6 different fights mixed together and that number is the 300th best log of this sample.<br />
<br />
Median is the 50th percentile of a sample or, simply put, the exact center of the sample Remember median is different from average and is not biased by extreme high or extreme low numbers, but it's biased by the number of samples. <br />
That spike in the fire mages graphic line was caused by the low number of samples. The spike happened because the fire mage sample had less then 200 logs (100 logs from alysrazor and less than 100 from other fights), so the median was a log from alysrazor, as the number of logs from other fights got higher the median went from alysrazor to some other fight where fire mages perform a lot worse.<br />
<br />
Of course mixing logs from 6 different fights and trying to get an absolut number we'll give us a meaningless number. If you want to know how classes are performing I suggest you enter the site and check the data separated by fights.</div></div><hr />

Since haste increases dots and your crits apply dots, the combustion cooldown when the bird it taking extra damage can easily tick for 100k+ (that's every second, so kind of like a flat 100k dps increase for its duration).Gotta give it to fire mages, they are the gimmick masters.</div></div><hr />

You don't even understand what the hybrid tax was and you don't even know what your talking about. The hybrid tax, which is now gone and does not exist, was not switching specs between fights, because that didn't exist before wotlk. The hybrid tax was how much healing a class could do in a non healing spec or or how much tanking a class with a tank spec could do when not in that tanking spec. It had NOTHING to do with switching specs between fights. <br />
<br />
In case you didnt get the memo, Blizz changed the classes so you don't HAVE to bring one spec/class to a fight because their are no more unique raid buffs. Its bring the player not the class now.<br />
<br />
<br />
The hybrid tax was a long time ago and is long gone. DPS spec does DPS now, they dont do anything else.</div></div><hr />

Alts do not rank top 100, also a lot of top guilds do not use public logs, also you can set the data to all data avaiable instead of top 100.<br />

All this does is under represent hybrid classes and make them look worse than they really are, compared to say, mages and hunters who only really have one viable spec (and thus that spec is more popular, and the top 100 ranks make up a smaller percentage of the class). <br />
<br />
Here we can see the difference between most specs is marginal: http://raidbots.com/dpsbot/Overall_DPS/25H/all/14/30/default/ <br />
Here we can see the relative popularity between specs: http://raidbots.com/dpsbot/Overall_DPS/25H/all/14/30/samples/#3vv <br />
<br />
Using this as a tool to directly compare where players 'should' be is a bad idea, since you're effectively just setting a higher bar for people playing Arcane, MM, Shadow, etc. It's the same reason less popular classes get ranks on WoL far more easily even when under performing. Comparing their DPS to overall DPS, rather than a specific number of players, is a far better idea.</div></div><hr />

(less now, since Firelands)<br />
<br />
Here is an example:<br />
<br />
http://www.worldoflogs.com/reports/6i15wcs2vaijin4t/sum/damageDone/?s=0&amp;e=20#Rasgal<br />
<br />
20 seconds Alyzrazor fight? I don't think so. It's either a bug or someone manufactured it so that the log lasts for the combustion duration with potions, bloodlust etc. all up. The mage spike on the chart? Fire mages ofc. As long as these &quot;fake logs&quot; or bugged logs are on WoL the numbers will be skewed in favor of haste scaling and high cooldown classes like dot classes and mages.<br />
<br />
What can we take from this chart? Some specs don't see much use in high-end guilds either because their gimmick doesnt function well on certain bosses (rogue/feral having to stay behind target is being worked on) or they are sub-par by maybe 1k dps. So those specs become &quot;fun-specs&quot; for lower end guilds and their dps numbers will be that much lower. Any high-end dk will be running frost atm - it's almost the same gear for 2h anyway. So come back on dps bots and look at the chart when WoL has fixed those bugged/fake logs and take a look at the dps numbers past that date and you'll get a better picture.<br />

I exchanged versatility for DPS by choosing a pure DPS class.<br />
Lies. You chose &quot;in your face&quot; class in roguecraft times.<br />
Times when nowadays &quot;hybrids&quot; had to pay (at that time) whopping 100g, put on crappy gear to go farm a bit gold, then pay another 100g, to tank or to stare at health bars and heal your selfish ass in raids.<br />
<br />
Now go cry me a river about &quot;not choosing versatility&quot;.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fangless</div><div class="date">2011-07-29, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is an example:<br />
<br />
http://www.worldoflogs.com/reports/6i15wcs2vaijin4t/sum/damageDone/?s=0&amp;e=20#Rasgal<br />
<br />
20 seconds Alyzrazor fight? I don't think so. It's either a bug or someone manufactured it so that the log lasts for the combustion duration with potions, bloodlust etc. all up. The mage spike on the chart? Fire mages ofc. As long as these &quot;fake logs&quot; or bugged logs are on WoL the numbers will be skewed in favor of haste scaling and high cooldown classes like dot classes and mages.<br />
<br />
What can we take from this chart? Some specs don't see much use in high-end guilds either because their gimmick doesnt function well on certain bosses (rogue/feral having to stay behind target is being worked on) or they are sub-par by maybe 1k dps. So those specs become &quot;fun-specs&quot; for lower end guilds and their dps numbers will be that much lower. Any high-end dk will be running frost atm - it's almost the same gear for 2h anyway. So come back on dps bots and look at the chart when WoL has fixed those bugged/fake logs and take a look at the dps numbers past that date and you'll get a better picture.<br />
<br />
PS. I just bought that damn Masterwork Elementium Deathblade and now you nerf it?? Goddamn it.<br />
<br />
The top mage dps is shown as 112k, not the 300k+ from a 0:20 second log. There are only 3 out of a 100 logs that are 100k+, the rest seem to be more down to earth. So, seems like the site is smarter than you think.</div></div><hr />

The hybrid tax, which is now gone and does not exist, was not switching specs between fights, because that didn't exist before wotlk. The hybrid tax was how much healing a class could do in a non healing spec or or how much tanking a class with a tank spec could do when not in that tanking spec. It had NOTHING to do with switching specs between fights. <br />
<br />
The thought was that DPS-only classes should be able to do a higher amount of dps than hybrid classes in general. It had nothing to do with them being able to heal and dps in the same fight. It was simply because of the fact that they could switch specs and heal or tank if needed. The intent was to increase the popularity of dps-only classes, as hybrid classes are more common. <br />
<br />
<br />
The hybrid tax was a long time ago and is long gone. DPS spec does DPS now, they dont do anything else.<br />
<br />
Stop spreading this retarded bullshit propaganda that Blizz wants hybrids to be lower than non hybrids because they changed their mind on that before WotLK. Nobody believes you except for yourself and you sound like a stupid asshole. <br />
<br />
As of April 2010 the hybrid tax still existed, per a blue post at the bottom of this article http://www.warcrafthuntersunion.com/2011/06/history-of-the-hybrix-tax-with-ghostcrawler-quotes/<br />
<br />
I'd suggest you give it a read, as the hybrid tax is not at all what you think it is.</div></div><hr />

The reason feral is currently fotm has nothing to do how much dps they do. What matters is how they do it. Bleeds are the problem. They're undispellable, unresistable, and unmitigated by armor. Since ferals derive a far higher portion of their dps from bleeds than any other spec it can create problems.<br />
<br />
No they are not! Bleed damage is directly affected by cat mastery. It would be just ridiculous that any class ability could negate other class/spec mastery effect. <br />
<br />
Do you really think it would be &quot;wise&quot; that any class would be able to negate /or dispell entire stat. For exact same reason Armor Penetration was removed from the game!<br />
<br />
If at all this is a math problem and here you can clearly see that in PvE Feral are not that much OP. Compared to others they are even underpowered. <br />
<br />
On the other hand WoW PvP is based on CC then burst, burst, burst with crits in between (even with resilience). That is how players set up their kills even without Ferals! Feral is not the only class designed that way. Even Ret when they pop all their dps CD, can obliterate player if they are lucky with crits. <br />
<br />
If you are incapable to hide your back (and force him to use mangle) from a feral when they pop all their dps CD YOU DESERVE TO DIE.</div></div><hr />

Because Sucking != being in the middle.<br />
<br />
Because someon HAS to be the best and someone HAS to be the worst.<br />
<br />
Because ALL classes have strengths and weaknesses.<br />
<br />
Because it is mathematically impossible to balance everything within 0.0001% and retain class / spec flavor.<br />

Because you want to? Because you like the class? The concept of &quot;pures&quot; = more DPS kinda went out the window a while ago. Same with &quot;hybrids&quot; and certain necessary buffs only they brought. You should have figured this out when two &quot;pures&quot; got Heroism/Bloodlust and one &quot;pure&quot; received some of the best self-healing in the game. You are supposed to actually play your class good and have your skill speak for you if you want invites and stuff now, rather than winning the &quot;my class is FOTM&quot; lottery.</div></div><hr />

Simply put, if you go over the logs over at WoL, you will see several fights only lasting 1 minute or less. This is because people are either cheating the system to get top ranked or starting their logs late on a fight. This makes the data they are gathering pretty much worthless and the current state of WoL makes it worthless until they actually put in a minimum damage done number (or duration) for each fight on WoL. So, take this table with a grain of salt, because it is HIGHLY inaccurate data.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">anyaka21</div><div class="date">2011-07-29, 08:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess most people here do not understand those numbers, so i'll try to explain. <br />
<br />
The numbers in the front page are the median of the top 100 logs of each of the first 6 fights in firelands, meaning the sample is made of 600 logs of 6 different fights mixed together and that number is the 300th best log of this sample.<br />
<br />
Median is the 50th percentile of a sample or, simply put, the exact center of the sample Remember median is different from average and is not biased by extreme high or extreme low numbers, but it's biased by the number of samples. <br />
That spike in the fire mages graphic line was caused by the low number of samples. The spike happened because the fire mage sample had less then 200 logs (100 logs from alysrazor and less than 100 from other fights), so the median was a log from alysrazor, as the number of logs from other fights got higher the median went from alysrazor to some other fight where fire mages perform a lot worse.<br />
<br />
Of course mixing logs from 6 different fights and trying to get an absolut number we'll give us a meaningless number. If you want to know how classes are performing I suggest you enter the site and check the data separated by fights.<br />
<br />
This is where you are uninformed. Sure it is the 50th percentile, but it's the 50th percentile of the top 100, or essentially top 50. That's the TOP 50 LOGS IN THE WORLD. Not even remotely close to an average of a decent raider. Add that this is from the top parses of HEROIC level raiding. In other words, people of immensely better gear. Why? Because a) it's heroic b) in order to get the top parses, they are going to have to have serious gear c) since a lot of parses and classes have a lot of RNG based crits, then you will see the top RNG numbers, not even remotely close to average numbers.</div></div><hr />

The point is the site is great for data analysis, the problem is the misuse by people who can't understand what the data means.<br />
<br />
While true, how do you know that alts don't rank? You have no proof. My high ranking guilds run multiple raids gearing up alts at the same time as mains for the simple reason of finding the best composition to do a boss. Remember Heroic Nef25 by Paragon? How many druids? So you're saying alts don't matter? Are you saying those alts weren't geared?<br />
<br />
Head back to ICC, how many raids did Paragon or Ensidia do per week? They ran like 3 or 4 in conjunction to get tons of attempts on bosses with limited attempts. All those toons got geared.<br />
<br />
Add that, the top parses, aren't necessarilty the top 100. Chances are it's top 50 because I'm sure there are multiple instances of the same toon on a different fight on a different week.<br />
<br />
A real true use of the site, is as you say, taking all the fights, only kills, on normal and heroic. And then comparing. Not taking the top 100 parses of Heroic fights.<br />
<br />
---------- Post added 2011-07-29 at 08:52 PM ----------<br />
<br />
<br />
The bugged logs don't matter since those numbers are not an average, 100k dps or 1 trillion dps the median stays the same.<br />
<br />
again, more inaccuracies in regards to statistics. Especially since we are talking top 100. Sure the top ones are taken out. But that also means that the higher parses get moved DOWN in relation because of the bugged parses. The result is inaccuracies.</div></div><hr />

Blizz went back on that a LOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG time ago. You can stop this stupid little fantasy you got in your head that your rogue should be topping hybrids. <br />
<br />
What healing is a Ret Paladin, Feral Druid, Enchancment Shaman going to do in a 25 man heroic raid? None.<br />
How long is a Ret Paladin or a Frost DK going to tank a 25 Heroic boss? A lot less than a rogue can with Evasion<br />
<br />
The utility that hybrid classes bring is nothing anymore except for CC. The ONLY thing that matters if your DPS is DPS. Rogues have fare far utility than most hybrid classes in 25 man raids, so by your incredibly stupid logic they should have less DPS than a Ret Paladin. <br />
<br />
Stop spreading this retarded bullshit propaganda that Blizz wants hybrids to be lower than non hybrids because they changed their mind on that before WotLK. Nobody believes you except for yourself and you sound like a stupid asshole.<br />
<br />
Chad great response in proving ignorant points. <br />
<br />
During our progression raids, bringing hybrids is a huge advantage. First of all, a hybrid could switch at any time out of combat in the raid and fill another position (Tank, Healer, or DPS depending on the hybrid) that raid required them to play to help complete current content. So tell me that is not an advantage. Also, if you have never had a feral/boomkin druid pop tranquility in almost raid wipe situations your are lying(or healing rains). Secondly, it is insanely easy to gear hybrids compared to pure dps classes. Please talk to Blizz about getting me under a 40 minute que for heroics.. (definitely not an advantage to gearing a hybrid)</div></div><hr />

During our progression raids, bringing hybrids is a huge advantage. First of all, a hybrid could switch at any time out of combat in the raid and fill another position (Tank, Healer, or DPS depending on the hybrid) that raid required them to play to help complete current content. So tell me that is not an advantage. Also, if you have never had a feral/boomkin druid pop tranquility in almost raid wipe situations your are lying(or healing rains). Secondly, it is insanely easy to gear hybrids compared to pure dps classes. Please talk to Blizz about getting me under a 40 minute que for heroics.. (definitely not an advantage to gearing a hybrid)<br />

Where is this off set gear going to come from since this is so called progression? Oh right, they have to get it, literally taking them twice as long to get a set for that off-role, while you could bring and gear up an alt nearly as fast. Not to mention there is a far bigger difference between switching specs as a rogue and switching specs as a paladin or druid or whatever. The role changes completely so you have to learn fights from a completely different perspective and be good enough to raid with said spec as well. Not to mention you can pick the best of your 3 DPS specs for a particular fight while they are stuck with one or maybe two depending on class. And that is even IF they want to switch specs, because many never do. Blizzard realized a long time ago that penalizing people for an extra option when they already had to go through that extra work was stupid, and they don't do it anymore. Popping Tranq does not suddenly make a Boomkin a healer any more than a Rogue popping Evasion makes them a tank, it's just something the class/spec can do to help.<br />

So yea, please don't attempt to call people ignorant just because they don't agree with you. Learn to be respectful and agree to disagree and move on rather than calling people ignorant just for disagreeing with your outdated mindset.</div></div><hr />

Well, first Kenai.. You are right ignorant was a bit harsh. My apologies! <br />
On to the gearing off set: Yes you are gearing your TOON with valor points for your Tier items typically at the start. So instant to almost instant ques are nice and beneficial. Now on to the next point: In our 10 man progression our core raiders get off set pieces all the time, considering Druids, Pallies, and Shammies don’t have lot to compete with when there gear drops... Doubt that rouge wants that intellect leather.. Point being that IMO it is way easier gearing hybrids. And you can’t compare Evasion with a boomkin popping Tranq.. really.. That hardly ever happens.. and typically is fail… And finally, the best of our three dps specs… Well, typically the other 2 blow(low dps) and you can’t use them if you want to be competitive. And for all you tools that say play the spec you like… your dps shouldn’t matter, then why are you reading this forum.</div></div><hr />
