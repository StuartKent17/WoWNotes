Description from the Youtube video<br />
Soloing Patchwerk 25-man version was something I had been meaning to do for a while. The main reason I did not attempt it sooner was because of all the trash leading up to him. I had no idea how to handle trash re-spawning or if any of my ideas would even work. I spent a great deal of time thinking about how I would handle every aspect of the fight but I had to resolve numerous issues during the thought process and had to overcome various things which I thought would make the fight impossible. Eventually, I came up with 2 and in most cases 3 ways of handling every problem Patchwerk could throw at me. However, I also came into this fight with a technique I figured out elsewhere, a Shadowstep technique I dub Jiderstep. This technique involves an Unconscious Dig Rat (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/5052/unconscious-dig-rat/) which is considered a critter and it is just like any other rat/critter in game except for the fact you can drop it where you like and it stays put and lasts until it is killed or the server is restarted. You can shadowstep to it just like any other critter. Due to the significant increase in his health pool I tested my methods successfully on live servers in 10-man before moving on to kill it on 25-man live server. <br />
<br />
The fight takes places in two positions, one in the tunnel past Grobbulus, the other on the floor along Patchwerk's patrol path. The setup begins by Shadowstepping to Grobbulus on the platform he tosses his slimes from. I then go into the poison tunnel that leads to Gluth to drop an Unconscious Dig Rat at a key location inside the tunnel where there is a hole that leads back to Patchwerk's room. This position and the floor position are important as they are beyond the leash points for Grobbulus and they allow me to Shadowstep up and drop down whenever I need to. Once the Unconscious Dig Rat is in the right position I jump down and buff and get ready to pull Patchwerk. I execute the pull by pre-potting and launching a Hand-Mounted Pyro Rocket (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/54998/hand-mounted-pyro-rocket/). The use of a ranged attack to pull is important as it will require him to path all the way to that point to reset/full heal after a Vanish or Shadowmeld.<br />
<br />
After that, the fight basically becomes a repetition involving a few key ideas. Firstly, I never engage Patchwerk without Evasion. Anytime I am attacking and Evasion is about to wear off, I either Shadowstep up to the tunnel or drop down to the floor. This forces him to spend a great deal of time pathing which enables me to wait for the Evasion cooldown and to heal myself. Another key point is using Vanish and Shadowmeld appropriately. On the initial aggro of Patchwerk, his trash is also put into combat which requires me to Vanish it off but I also use it during the fight to reset his enrage timer which eliminates the need to deal with the increased damage and slime bolts. To do this, I wait for Preparation to come back up, and then I wait until Patchwerk reaches the poison tunnel position. I jump off and immediately Shadowmeld which gets me out of combat and gives me time to eat and/or rebuff as needed. My potion timer also resets. Since I am no longer in combat Patchwerk is in evade mode and begins his pathing back from the tunnel through Grobbulus' room. This is where the pull positioning comes in to play as I am already waiting to intercept him well before his final reset point which would heal him to full. When I engage him his trash aggros again which forces me to Vanish. I watch carefully and if that Vanish fails to reset the trash I burn Preparation and Vanish again. This cycle is repeated until the boss is dead which resulted in a fight lasting 4 hours 45 minutes on my kill.<br />

Both weapons are enchanted with mongoose and Instant poison main-hand and Deadly poison off-hand. The reason behind using Purified Shard of the Flame (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49463/purified-shard-of-the-flame/) was to counter the significant nature damage from the tunnel (ticks added up to ~2 million damage) and provide extra healing. Other methods of healing included eating, bandages, and Dense Stone Statues (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/32809/dense-stone-statue/). The talent spec (http://www.wowhead.com/talent#fZ0gqb0cZtMcdI0kdVuAcRx:oqdzmc) used was 0/18/53 and glyphs were Hemo/evasion/ghostly strike. Besides Shadowstep, many of the talents chosen are very useful for this encounter by providing extra survivability (Enveloping Shadows, Cheat Death), increased damage (Dirty Deeds, Setup), or both (Sinister Calling, Lightning Reflexes, Endurance).<br />

Jay Mohr at BlizzCon 2010<br />
Comedian and actor Jay Mohr will be returning to BlizzCon this year to serve as master of ceremonies for the live costume contest and other contests on the first night of the show. Jay is the star of the popular television show Gary Unmarried, and is known for his roles in movies like Jerry Maguire and for creating, producing, and hosting the successful TV series Last Comic Standing. We'll have more info to share about the Friday-night contests and other events at BlizzCon in the months leading up to the show, so keep your eye on BlizzCon.com for more details.

Blizzcon on the east coast?<br />
We're always open to the idea of hosting BlizzCon elsewhere. Consider though that every BlizzCon and Worldwide Invitational in the past took place in cities where we have local Blizzard offices.<br />
<br />
The primary issue with hosting BlizzCon on the east coast is one of logistics. A large number of people helping to set up and run BlizzCon are actually Blizzard employees. Set up and rehearsals begin days before the start of the event. Sending at least 75% of our Irvine staff to the east coast for at least a week could easily cause major logistical issues with maintaining daily operations, in addition to the substantial extra costs.

The deathknight killed Sarth 10 man with full tank gear and the healing abilities of a deathknight.<br />
<br />
The rogue killed patchwerk 25 man, a boss that hits very hard.<br />
<br />
<br />
So go take your DK fanboyisms somewhere else.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah he killed the boss, making sure Evasion was up everytime he engaged him making sure he never got hit + exploiting the encounter by avoiding enrage, thus taking him almost 5 hours to kill him. The idea is of course clever, it was still an exploit.</div></div><hr />

Shadowstepping at rat, waiting for patchwerk to come to him, jump down use pot and bandage then continue.... Nope, not impressive at all.<br />
<br />
Oh and banning mutliboxing, GO FOR IT!<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe it's because you're a DK?<br />
<br />
I guess I'm just harder to impress than you, but I believe every video of DKs or Pallies soloing stuff are boring as hell, because both classes have tools to solo pretty much anything. And where's the challenge when you have the mitigation of a tank and the healing capabilities of a hybrid healer while tanking? <br />
<br />
No, I was not impressed at all by the DK soloing Sartharion. Because we all know the class is OP for those kind of encounters, and we know stuff like that is bound to happen one time or another.<br />
<br />
Now, a Rogue soloing Patchwerk? A Warlock soloing Hydross/Quagmirran (back in BC)? A Rogue tanking Gruul and Illidan? Exploit or not, those are impressing. Because it's not something the normal ragtag player can pull. It's not something you see every day. <br />
<br />
Faxmonkey soloing Onyxia was far more impressive than RandomPaladinOrDK #4812474.</div></div><hr />

Now that was impressive. This was merely exploiting however clever it may have been to come up with the tactics. Resetting the encounter without letting the boss get new health is the exact same exploit that a lot of people got banned for when 2 manning FL+4(25).<br />
<br />
Would I have done the same if I had come up with it first? Of course! I love doing challenges like this for myself. But I wouldn't brag about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Eziel, so you really think the Patchwerk fight was intended to be drawn out over hours, so he could be beat regardless of DPS, making the enrage timer completely useless?<br />
<br />
Man why so negative common. He used smart tactics and managed to do it witch is really impressive(and nobody is arguing that its not an exploit but who cares only the dedication for 5 hours straight of doing 1 and the same thing without making mistakes is more then what an averange raider can do)</div></div><hr />

I don't think anyone is arguing about how's this not an exploit, it's pretty clear it is. <br />
<br />
I also don't see how's that an excuse for something to not be impressive as well. Even if it's an exploit, it still took FIVE HOURS to do it. Most players don't have the stamina to do a 20-minute random, imagine fighting the same thing for FIVE. HOURS.<br />

<br />
You know, I don't see the Rogue or it's abilities as an exploit, but the Dig Rat itself.<br />
<br />
Critters &quot;captured&quot; with Critter Bites run away from you after 5 minutes. The Dig Rat works in a similar fashion and I don't see why it's supposed to stay alive and kicking after 5 hours. Nerfing this would be the most sane thing to do. <br />
<br />
He exploited the fact that he could set a Shadowstep dummy indifinitely. <br />
<br />
I might be wrong and he might have summoned more than one, but according to his video he only used one (he even mentioned it stays there till server restarts and all, so that adds to my theory) and that's where the exploit lies.</div></div><hr />

The bug he used, therefore exploiting game mechanics, is the fact that patchwork does not reset his hp pool when he goes into evade mode, while keeping him off the enrage. Sorry to say but the only thing I can compliment here is the endurance of that guy, and the fact that he found this exploid to beginn with, using a shadowstep makro to jump some critter/pet/what ever was up there and using evasion every cd is not that much of a show of skill as some make it out to be. Still, a feat showing how sloppy some game mechanics are and that some encounter coding does not seem to be copy and paste afterall :P<br />

<br />
<br />
Wrong.<br />
<br />
The leashing out bug is that a mob won't reset his health to full, till said mob reaches the spot he was before engaging in combat. Patchwerk has a pretty long patrolling path so Jider would've pulled him as far as he could from the Gluth tunnel, heal himself, and abusing the bug to not let him heal. <br />
<br />
If what you said was indeed true, then anyone could solo Patchwerk given enough patience and gold for repairs, since the mobs go into evade mode when they wipe a raid.</div></div><hr />

I think Blizzard's going to find this as an exploit, not so much the evading/getting out of combat but more along the lines of it resetting his enrage timer. Being able to evade something, and then get it back in combat without it resetting health has been around, and I'd bet is most likely something Blizzard would/has had problems fixing. However, the intended use of the enrage timer on that fight is to prevent you from fighting him for 5 hours - being able to avoid that won't be seen as &quot;clever use of game mechanics&quot; to Blizzard. Remember all that crap about the Yogg+0 exploit? They were clearly being clever, but they were still exploiting. That being said, I don't think Blizzard would ban the guy for this, Patchwerk is old news. They'll most likely just use it as a reference to tweak things in the future to prevent something like this - especially since this will be plastered all over the place now.<br />
<br />
So congrats on the 5 hour fight, the rat/shadowstep thing was cool, but an exploit is an exploit. This fight will more than likely be truly solo'd by a DK tank before anyone else - Probably in some end tier Cata gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To enter Naxx, you have to be in a raid, but the other members didn't give him any help.<br />
<br />
Also, if you read the description, he drops combat using vanish and shadowmeld in order to reset the enrage timer.<br />
<br />
Edit: Also, I find it pretty impressive someone managing this: nice job. <br />
<br />
I expect Blizzard won't ban him because the gear from Naxx 25 is worse than the stuff you obtain from HCs, and the extreme amount of time and effort for one boss makes it pretty damn useless for gear grinding. That's not to say they won't fix it though.</div></div><hr />

&quot;On the initial aggro of Patchwerk, his trash is also put into combat which requires me to Vanish it off but I also use it during the fight to reset his enrage timer which eliminates the need to deal with the increased damage and slime bolts&quot;</div></div><hr />

Sadly, there are many people who simply can not deal with someone else doing something cool. I mean, we even got the stupid guy saying it was fake that seems to appear in all of those threads. The point is that, if you had not seen this and would have asked whether it would be possible to solo patchwerk 25, you would have said that it is simply impossible. This is the one thing that makes it so impressive. Most people would not even have thought about trying it, and not because they do not care, but because they simply would not see the slightest possibility of success.</div></div><hr />

It also adresses your first comment &quot;If it was a bug developers would have fixed it.&quot; Evading mechanic is the fix (like 4,5 years old). Before that you could attack mob that cannot reach you and the mob would just stand there doing nothing.<br />
<br />
Have you never ever used the ZG bug to solo Thekal? You have to evade him by using a tree stump, then re-engage him while his adds reset. The check &quot;whether the adds are alive&quot; would fail and he would go into Phase 2.</div></div><hr />

This. Just cause all the proles whining about this being an exploit could never dream of doing this for themselves doesn't mean it's wrong, nor does it in any way diminish the achievement of being the first person in the world to solo a 25-man raid boss using the mechanics blizzard put in place, whether or not they intended them(which imo they did, although maybe not for this purpose.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Again. Mage soloed 25-man Naxx using only buffs and debuffs available in the instance. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ggLGj37qI<br />

Did you even to begin to think that if you met 5 players you would be dead anyway? This argument against multiboxing is invalid. If he pays for 5 accounts, what difference does it make if he controls them himself or has 4 other friends ganking with him? <br />

Nothing stops you from doing the exact thing he does. Unless you fail too much to control 5 characters at once in which case you should go back to The Sims.</div></div><hr />

The Fail is strong in this one.<br />

<br />
In PvP, if you met 5 opposing players you will get smoked, regardless if they are multi-boxed or individual players.<br />
Good luck trying to get a decent arena rating while multi-boxing.<br />
<br />
In PvE, you can multi-box easy 5-man heroics and some lower level raids, not progression content.<br />
Good luck trying to effectively multibox progression content.<br />
<br />
It may give an in-game advantage in some ways, but only really in the time-saver department (level up all at once or farm badges all at once). Maybe it allows you to tackle some group content without involving other players, but it really isn't that difficult to find other players.</div></div><hr />

Pardon me, Sir, but honestly, you cannot simply compare Raegwyn to this guy, at all.<br />

Can you really compare this guy to anything Raegwynn has done? Raegwynn even posted in one of the earlier threads last week giving props to this guy. Pro attitude on Raegwynn too.<br />
<br />
This achievment, even though i couldn't have been possible without usage of pathing exploits and combat exploits, is the very essence of humanity. We will ALWAYS manage to evade by the rules, avoid complications, be creative and succeed. <br />
<br />
My faith in humanity gets renewed everytime i see something exceptionall like this, only to be eaten bit by bit later.</div></div><hr />

NO ONE CARES about a DK TANK, who overgeared the content soloing quite possibly one of the easiest encounters for said class. DK fanbois are obvious. Theres a reason almost every guild used a DK to do 3 Drake 10 man, when it was the hardest encounter available at the time, since he could completely ignore the large amount of incoming Magic Damage. Any half brained DK tank with current gear can do this, hes not special. (No offense intended towards Raegwyn)</div></div><hr />

It's not even fun to watch. I'm sorry but where is the skill? Is it in using evasion? Is that where his skill shines? Oh no wait, it must be when he shadowsteps skillfully. NO WAIT, his skill is clearly evident when he vanishes and Patchwerk doesn't.<br />
<br />
Shadowstepping up and jumping down isn't really kiting a mob, as actual kiting would take some skill especially if you were kiting for hours. Basically all he does is pop all his cooldowns and when they're down he gets out of combat until they are up again. Repeat. That's all he does for the entire duration of the video, set to some unfitting techno music.<br />
<br />
<br />
Do it your self and prove it's so damn easy, NO fuckups during that amount of time is impressive, but that isn't really the most impressive part about his accomplishment. Coming up with this way of killing a boss that was said to be impossible to solo, the guy is a freaking genious.<br />

If Sarth 10 is solo easy to solo why has Ragewyn been the only one to solo it?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Pardon me, Sir, but honestly, you cannot simply compare Raegwyn to this guy, at all.<br />
<br />
1) Thinking outside the box (really, who thought EVER about soloing patchwerk)<br />
2) Probably hours of analysing problems that could come up, gear choices, glyph choices, spec;<br />

4) Brutal dedication: he never gave up.Do you really think that he got it right the very first time? everything here has been trial and error for him<br />

6) Perfection: you have the video. THERE it is, for 5 straight hours this person made no mistakes under the pressure.<br />
<br />
<br />
First let me state that I'm sorry if you think that I do not give this guy mad props, as I said in an earlier post. I agree with all that you posted, but think about this.<br />
<br />
1) Thinking outside the box - Whoever thought of soloing Sarth? Whoever thought of using the spec that Ragewyn used?<br />
2) Probably hours of analysing problems - Ragewyn had to deal with an enrage, and he had to use the right balance of gear to survive while doing enough damage. In addition he made his own spec up in an attempt to deal more damage while still surviving.<br />
3) Inhuman effort - Ragewyn took over 100 attemts at soloing Sarth (with each of them being about 15 min ... that's 25 hours not including corspe running, going to repair, etc).<br />
4) Brutal dedication: he never gave up.Do you really think that he got it right the very first time? everything here has been trial and error for him - Same for Ragewyn, he got it after 100 attempts, but never gave up before that<br />
6) Perfection: you have the video. THERE it is, for 5 straight hours this person made no mistakes under the pressure - Your forgetting that he wasn't &quot;feeling the pressure&quot; for all 5 hours. While tanking Patchwerk he didn't take much damage from him (he was over 102.7% avoidence), and while kiting Patchwerk he would just Jiderstep up, wait, jump down, JS up, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
5 would just be repetition, but w/e<br />
5) 5 hours spent on achieving this; no mention about how many it took to come up with a strategy, attempts, failed attempts etc; - Ragewyn spent over 100 attempts, each being about 15 min long, trying to down him, not to mention how long it took him to find a strat to deal with the enrage timer and the adds, and a spec to do it with.<br />
<br />
Next, Who was talking about one having a bigger e-peen than the other? I just don't understand why Boub would post a solo (again, it was incredible, not denying that) that clearly used an exploit and not a solo that did not use an exploit, both of which on WotLK content. In addition, who cares if it is on 25 man? 25-man raiding is the same content as 10-man raiding, so why does it make a difference when soloing? <br />
<br />
Side Note: All of you talking about the mage that soloed Military Quarter and therefore soloed Patchwerk ... Patchwerk is in in the Construct Quarter, not the Military Quarter.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deckon</div><div class="date">2010-05-22, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This. Just cause all the proles whining about this being an exploit could never dream of doing this for themselves doesn't mean it's wrong, nor does it in any way diminish the achievement of being the first person in the world to solo a 25-man raid boss using the mechanics blizzard put in place, whether or not they intended them(which imo they did, although maybe not for this purpose.)<br />
<br />
<br />
But he's not the first person to solo a 25m raid boss. I do not recall the name of the mage who solo'd the military wing at the beginning of WotLKm but he solo'd 4 bosses. (I know he had help with a sacrificial lamb in the forms of a friend aggroing the first 2 pulls so his invisibility, and invis pot would last long enough to get him to the death knights downstairs) but he did solo the 4 bosses of that wing with out the help of any other player using, at that time, in game mechanics. His result was a perma ban if I recall, and the nerfing of IA, and making the bone shield un-spellstealable.</div></div><hr />

There's no support for multi-boxing on our end. We tolerate it. For now.<br />
Looks like the stance on multi-boxing is starting to change. While it's been a known fact that Blizz does not support, nor cater to, multi-boxers, the change in terminology is somewhat alarming. I've followed MBrs for a while, as far back as Lineage 2 in early 2004 before WoW even had its first Open Beta. I've never seen Blizz give an indication that they may be displeased with this style of play, but saying &quot;We tolerate it.&quot; indicates someone stepped on some toes somewhere along the way and now they're taking a closer look at that aspect of the community. Will be interesting to see what happens down the road.</div></div><hr />

Now, a Rogue soloing Patchwerk? A Warlock soloing Hydross/Quagmirran (back in BC)? A Rogue tanking Gruul and Illidan? Exploit or not, those are impressing. Because it's not something the normal ragtag player can pull. It's not something you see every day. <br />

I frankly don't care if it was a bug, exploit or not. It was still pretty damn cool, and it took a lot of time and dedication, not to mention skill. So grats to the man! Was a good show.<br />
<br />
<br />
You're right, so much could have gone wrong...<br />
<br />
like his Health resetting properly, his Enrage timer NOT resetting, being unable to re-pot in combat...<br />
<br />
Yeah, had the encounter gone the way it was designed and he'd still solo'd it, nobody would be giving him any grief.<br />
<br />
Instead, it's just another video of someone finding a bug and exploiting it.<br />
<br />
The only thing I applaud is his persistence and patience. That's a LONG time, and it's not like you can just get up and take a break. <br />
<br />
<br />
Full video or it didn't happen. How can we be positive that he didn't bring in other players during the edited parts?<br />
<br />
There isn't a hosting site in the world that would allow a 5-hour video of that quality to be uploaded in one piece. He'd have to break it up into dozens of small videos, and then people like you would say &quot;NAH IT'S DIFFERENT ATTEMPS LOLS HE CHEATED&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Honestly I don't believe any other character was involved in. Even if it's moving at 4x speed do you really want an hour long video?<br />
<br />
That being said I don't even want to watch it a second time. I'll give the man some credit for sticking it out that long but you fight a boss for, probably, 30 minutes.. and woop-de-do you hop up and down for the other 4 hours. Using the exploits of mechanics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, exactly the same thing. Exploit boss pathing. Only difference here is time taken, as rogue does less damage, and use of shadow step instead of discovering the route across the pipes where hydross cannot follow you.<br />
<br />
Though I'm honestly not sure about the time. I recall warlock's gear being all broken from casting spells for so long by the time hydross died :)</div></div><hr />

I remember using the blink thru deadmines to explore and post outlands info back in the day. Basically owuld take you to nagrand. I never got banned nor punished at all. Eventually because of letting them and the community know how, it forces them to do their job that people's money, pays them to do.<br />
<br />
This guy spent almost 5 hours (and I'm sure countless hours perfecting it). <br />
<br />
As for blizzard and multi boxing. Thats been blizzards stand on it since WoW came out. I remember seeing countless people running around with 5 accounts and owning it up. These people 100% of the time will sell these accounts. Only a VERY few I know of, and including myself. Would level like.. 1-2 extra people with the main guy I was playing. Doing 5 was just.. boring as shit. I'd level my friends alt and my alt with my main, or level 2 alts and a friends. <br />
<br />
Blizzard will never and has never done anything AGAINST multi boxing. Why? For every account is 15 dollars a month. 15 X 5 = 75 a month vs the regular 15. So a 60 dollar profit off someone who has nothing better to do. <br />
<br />
Blizzard enjoys your money. Hell you people buy virtual pets, cards, etc. off them for $$. You think they are going to suddenly put a stop to this? Hahaha... that'll be the day.</div></div><hr />

That depends on the cheat, now if someone would cheat in stockcar races that would be bad.<br />

But the guy figured out a way to solo patch and nobody (and I do mean nobody) got cheated or hurt by it. So kudos to him, and nobody should be as jaded as you guys are.<br />

No, I was not impressed at all by the DK soloing Sartharion. Because we all know the class is OP for those kind of encounters, and we know stuff like that is bound to happen one time or another.<br />

An exploit is an exploit, not matter how serious it is. I to doubt that he will get perma-banned. Your example is not legit, as there is a major difference between what you did and what he did. You hid your exploiting, but he made a video of actually doing.<br />

<br />
how was he able to regain agro on patchwork before he went to agro point and reset?..it was my understanding that when a mob is &quot;reset&quot; they are unable to re-enter combat till they return to their initial agro point, meaning they have to reset before being able to be confronted again..i've tested this on numbers of mobs, including boss's in several places, and its always the same thing. they return to their agro point, without anyone being able to hit or engage them. how does this work without some sort of exploit?<br />
<br />
<br />
with all that said, i do congratulate the rogue in doing something many others definitely couldn't. just expect nerfs to your methids in the future, as this is clearly an exploit and abuse of that exploit to manipulate a boss encounter. enrage timers are there for a reason.</div></div><hr />

If it was simple patting it prolly would not get fixxed.<br />
But because he gets out of combat and is able to potion every 2minutes , it is a bug.<br />
<br />
<br />
It IS pathing, mobs don't go back to full health until they get back to their leash point and they evade on the way there, that's normal.<br />
<br />
The only thing that gets him out of combat is Vanish and Shadowmeld. Otherwise the entire time he is in combat and Patchwerk is running to him but he's very far away because of the dropping down and shadowstepping up to the tunnel.<br />
<br />
There is no &quot;bug&quot; here. The 2 key elements that allow him to do this is normal mob pathing and Shadowstepping to a spot that takes said mob a long time to get there.</div></div><hr />

Ahh I didn't even think of this until you said it, I have noticed this many times, but I certainly do remember times where I have aggroed mobs while they were on their way back to their agro point. Not sure what circumstances allow this to happen.<br />

On the other hand its not like doing this actualy grants him an advantage. He probably used up more gold in repairing his weapons and all those consumables than he got from the boss and it took almost 5 hours. This is more equivalent to the aflic lock soloing hydros in SSC. ya it can be done but why bother other than to say you did. will they eventualy change the evade buging? probably but evade/reset is already so bugy (in non exploitable ways) that it could take a while and I'd doubt this would be a high priority fix. as I said it probably cost him more than he gained and thats 5ish hours he'll never get back :P<br />

I'm not really impressed by rogues soloing anything for similar reasons you mentioned about DKs and Paladins. Rogues are one of the &quot;chosen classes&quot; with overpowered cooldowns who can do these kind of things. Now, a warrior, hunter or priest soloing a boss is impressive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it was simple patting it prolly would not get fixxed.<br />
But because he gets out of combat and is able to potion every 2minutes , it is a bug.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually it IS simple mob behavior. Mobs have been doing this same exact thing since vanilla. People used this trick to get Less, Rabi. In instances if you reset a mob but someone is in its path as it resets it will attack that person. This is not new this shouldn't be surprising. He used a game mechanic blizzard left in since release not an exploit. If you had said GIMMICKY that would have been correct.</div></div><hr />

I agree, mad respect to Jider for doing this. I agree, it does not seem like an exploit, but Blizzard will (probably) see it in a different way. Technically, he did get an unfair advantage by abusing a partial reset bug. He got loot and could have gotten the fast kill achievement if he didn't already have it (if he reset the enrage timer when Patch had 10k health or something).<br />
<br />
Note: Again, I do not think what Jider did should be considered an exploit, but I am simply stating the viewpoint Blizzard could possibly have. What Jider did is truly amazing, and haters should not hate.</div></div><hr />

Technically, it wasn't soloing, it involved 2 rogues and a stack of broken daggers by the end to &quot;One-Shot&quot; Kazzak and it was hotfixed within 24 hours of its occurrence.<br />
<br />
The talent was &quot;Reckoning&quot; and a Paladin who had stacked tons of it was a &quot;Reckoning Bomb&quot;. Homage is paid to it in the way of the Argent Crusade Quest Line in Icecrown when you have to defend the Crusade base from an attack from Scourgeholme. The attack you build up for that more or less kills everything in front of you is called the &quot;Reckoning Bomb&quot;</div></div><hr />

You see, the issue here is where do you draw the line? It's ok for a rogue to solo patchwerk by intentionally resetting the encounter to have his cool downs available for it but it's not ok for Ensidia to use an exploit to get a kill on LK? It has nothing to do with how much time is spent on soloing it but everything on how it's done and this is an obvious exploit. I'm not saying he should be banned for it, just that something should be done and people shouldn't necessarily congratulate him for bugging an encounter so he could solo it just to get attention. There should be no double standard just because he does something impressive for 5 hours, just as there wasn't one for a high end guild.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Except that he did, by resetting patchwerk it allowed him to have his cool downs available for when he engaged him, therein exploiting the encounter. It may not be loot that anyone wants anymore, but he did get loot from it, so your argument as to why it shouldn't be considered an exploit nullifies itself with that. Just because it's loot no one wants doesn't mean he didn't exploit the encounter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What approaches can they take:<br />
<br />
Stop WoW launching twice on one machine. - not guna happen, way to easy to get round, VMs etc<br />
Make WoW use so much resources you can only run it once - NEVER EVER going to happen<br />
Only allow so many connections per IP - again, never ever going to happen<br />
Remove loads of the macro commands that make it work - can't see this happening ever<br />
<br />
So uh.. yeah. COnsidering many/most of the 'professional' boxers out there use a couple of machines and some KVM (Which in case you didn't know is almost impossible to detect if its a proper switch) how can they ever get rid of it?<br />
<br />
A new clause in the ToS that states you cannot control multiple characters at the same time by any means? How on earth would they enforce that? Nothing can be done to those who want to multibox. It's just not doable without wrecking the interface which would piss off the greater majority of the players... who don't multibox.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess I'm just harder to impress than you, but I believe every video of DKs or Pallies soloing stuff are boring as hell, because both classes have tools to solo pretty much anything. And where's the challenge when you have the mitigation of a tank and the healing capabilities of a hybrid healer while tanking? <br />
<br />
No, I was not impressed at all by the DK soloing Sartharion. Because we all know the class is OP for those kind of encounters, and we know stuff like that is bound to happen one time or another.<br />
<br />
Now, a Rogue soloing Patchwerk? A Warlock soloing Hydross/Quagmirran (back in BC)? A Rogue tanking Gruul and Illidan? Exploit or not, those are impressing. Because it's not something the normal ragtag player can pull. It's not something you see every day. <br />
<br />
Faxmonkey soloing Onyxia was far more impressive than RandomPaladinOrDK #4812474.<br />
<br />
<br />
Every video yes, but the video of the DK soloing sartharion was not lame, or easy. <br />
That took a lot of work, you cant call something easy when you cant continue to fight after the boss enrages. Not that im saying the rogue had an easy time. <br />

Yes it was clever use of ingame mechanics that have been around for ages and yes rogues should probably get nerfed to prevent this from happening. Personally though i dont think id have the focus or stamina to do the same thing for 5 hours where 1 mistake would probably cost you the kill. These kind of kills, exploits or not usually involve a lot of effort and i personally find them very impressive. Most of the haters need to lighten up and laugh for once.</div></div><hr />

Sorry don't agree, he's using a exploit and apparently a 'rat' somewhere to jink himself out of battle and out of combat, it be nice if we all could do that for Raid Bosses life would be much simpler<br />
<br />
When the aforementioned rogue can go toe-to-toe with PW for the entire fight without using an exploit, and defeat him, then ill give him some respect, til then he's just another trigger happy DPS Type<br />
<br />
<br />
Yea, I can see by the all the careful planning that he's totally a &quot;trigger happy DPS Type&quot;.<br />

<br />
That is clever use of game mechanics, the exploit was resetting Patchwerk's enrage timer without resetting his health.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You see, the issue here is where do you draw the line? It's ok for a rogue to solo patchwerk by intentionally resetting the encounter to have his cool downs available for it but it's not ok for Ensidia to use an exploit to get a kill on LK? It has nothing to do with how much time is spent on soloing it but everything on how it's done and this is an obvious exploit. I'm not saying he should be banned for it, just that something should be done and people shouldn't necessarily congratulate him for bugging an encounter so he could solo it just to get attention. There should be no double standard just because he does something impressive for 5 hours, just as there wasn't one for a high end guild. <br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly, I think anything in the game should be legal provided you don't hack or cheat. I love abusing bugs and exploits in WoW, so I think what Exodus did for Yogg +0, what Ensidia did for LK 25, and what Jider did for Patchwerk. All I'm doing is pointing out the way Blizzard could (and probably will) see it as, since no one else will.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: I believe soloing Patchwerk, even through exploiting, is an impressive feat on its' own, so I believe what Jider did is awesome.</div></div><hr />

Patchwerk (25) Solo Kill by a Rogue<br />
Description from the Youtube video<br />
Soloing Patchwerk 25-man version was something I had been meaning to do for a while. The main reason I did not attempt it sooner was because of all the trash leading up to him. I had no idea how to handle trash re-spawning or if any of my ideas would even work. I spent a great deal of time thinking about how I would handle every aspect of the fight but I had to resolve numerous issues during the thought process and had to overcome various things which I thought would make the fight impossible. Eventually, I came up with 2 and in most cases 3 ways of handling every problem Patchwerk could throw at me. However, I also came into this fight with a technique I figured out elsewhere, a Shadowstep technique I dub Jiderstep. This technique involves an Unconscious Dig Rat (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/5052/unconscious-dig-rat/) which is considered a critter and it is just like any other rat/critter in game except for the fact you can drop it where you like and it stays put and lasts until it is killed or the server is restarted. You can shadowstep to it just like any other critter. Due to the significant increase in his health pool I tested my methods successfully on live servers in 10-man before moving on to kill it on 25-man live server. <br />
<br />
The fight takes places in two positions, one in the tunnel past Grobbulus, the other on the floor along Patchwerk's patrol path. The setup begins by Shadowstepping to Grobbulus on the platform he tosses his slimes from. I then go into the poison tunnel that leads to Gluth to drop an Unconscious Dig Rat at a key location inside the tunnel where there is a hole that leads back to Patchwerk's room. This position and the floor position are important as they are beyond the leash points for Grobbulus and they allow me to Shadowstep up and drop down whenever I need to. Once the Unconscious Dig Rat is in the right position I jump down and buff and get ready to pull Patchwerk. I execute the pull by pre-potting and launching a Hand-Mounted Pyro Rocket (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/54998/hand-mounted-pyro-rocket/). The use of a ranged attack to pull is important as it will require him to path all the way to that point to reset/full heal after a Vanish or Shadowmeld.<br />
<br />
After that, the fight basically becomes a repetition involving a few key ideas. Firstly, I never engage Patchwerk without Evasion. Anytime I am attacking and Evasion is about to wear off, I either Shadowstep up to the tunnel or drop down to the floor. This forces him to spend a great deal of time pathing which enables me to wait for the Evasion cooldown and to heal myself. Another key point is using Vanish and Shadowmeld appropriately. On the initial aggro of Patchwerk, his trash is also put into combat which requires me to Vanish it off but I also use it during the fight to reset his enrage timer which eliminates the need to deal with the increased damage and slime bolts. To do this, I wait for Preparation to come back up, and then I wait until Patchwerk reaches the poison tunnel position. I jump off and immediately Shadowmeld which gets me out of combat and gives me time to eat and/or rebuff as needed. My potion timer also resets. Since I am no longer in combat Patchwerk is in evade mode and begins his pathing back from the tunnel through Grobbulus' room. This is where the pull positioning comes in to play as I am already waiting to intercept him well before his final reset point which would heal him to full. When I engage him his trash aggros again which forces me to Vanish. I watch carefully and if that Vanish fails to reset the trash I burn Preparation and Vanish again. This cycle is repeated until the boss is dead which resulted in a fight lasting 4 hours 45 minutes on my kill.<br />

Jewel-crafting and Engineering professions. Gear used can be viewed here (http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Stormreaver&amp;cn=Jider&amp;gn=Impervious.). Both weapons are enchanted with mongoose and Instant poison main-hand and Deadly poison off-hand. The reason behind using Purified Shard of the Flame (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49463/purified-shard-of-the-flame/) was to counter the significant nature damage from the tunnel (ticks added up to ~2 million damage) and provide extra healing. Other methods of healing included eating, bandages, and Dense Stone Statues (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/32809/dense-stone-statue/). The talent spec (http://www.wowhead.com/talent#fZ0gqb0cZtMcdI0kdVuAcRx:oqdzmc) used was 0/18/53 and glyphs were Hemo/evasion/ghostly strike. Besides Shadowstep, many of the talents chosen are very useful for this encounter by providing extra survivability (Enveloping Shadows, Cheat Death), increased damage (Dirty Deeds, Setup), or both (Sinister Calling, Lightning Reflexes, Endurance).<br />
