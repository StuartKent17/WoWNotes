It won't. That requires server maintenance. This is just a minor bug fix patch.<br />
<br />
This bug fix patch also includes a fix for an issue with buffs/debuffs that affected raid performance (fps). Your fps should increase slightly in raids.</div></div><hr />

The creators of Cartographer have to release a new version for the fps to be fixed. Its their coding thats causing the problem.</div></div><hr />

Could you explain a bit further what this bug is? I've seen a few people in trade chat with socketing issues, but I couldn't find out what's up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sometimes you can't socket new items when there's still time left to trade it or give it back to the vendor. You can try to socket and click 'yes' but the gems won't stick in the item. Had this issue with a new item and had to enchant it first before socketing...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Which is funny, because I *haven't* had that issue. I bought a piece of gear for honor, immediately socketed THEN enchanted it.<br />
<br />
After the socket the &quot;you can return this item for a full refund in X&quot; dialog DID disappear, but it still told me &quot;this item will no longer be tradable&quot; afterwards when I enchanted it, so I think it was just a display bug.</div></div><hr />

I had this bug yesterday with only one item.<br />
<br />
I had a guildy tell me this error can be fixed with a macro.<br />
<br />
/script AcceptSockets()<br />
<br />
I didn't get a chance to try it,since the trading timer on my item expired and I was able to socket it, but he guaranteed it worked. And my guildies are not known for spreading false information.</div></div><hr />

Only issue is with rings for those who aren't enchanters, it would seem. After 2 hours, once the item becomes non-tradeable, however, you can socket the ring.</div></div><hr />
