You can lose. Later in the week on the Horde side people started to lose a few of them when it was only AFK alts. It's possible.<br />

Yes, you can lose a dungeon - when a team disbands after a wipe or ten.<br />
You can only lose a warfront if at least half of your team AFKs and you'd be stupid not to AFK at this point.</div></div><hr />

You can lose if your main npc dies, for the horde that is Eitrigg. Either at the beginning or as an assault force comes in.<br />
<br />
It's unlikely to happen yes. But it can definitely happen.<br />
<br />
At any rate I did it all through the week and up until the last day we had it and I never encountered more than 2 people who were afk. Most people just wanted to get it done as fast as possible.</div></div><hr />

Going AFK causes you to lose. Also you would be stupid to not go AFK.<br />

Losing by giving up is not losing - thats just giving up. In a Warfront you can actually be defeated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I'm not mistaken, based on my experience:<br />
- T1 is unranked chest rewards + airdrops (ilvl 325+)<br />
- T2 is warfronts (340+)<br />
- T3 is &quot;conquest points bar&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't know about ranked 'cause I don't do them, but htye probably award T2 / T3</div></div><hr />

It's been like that in Legion too. Since it's all region wide, the amount of players that could influence it is huge, so Blizzard has no idea how long it would take.<br />
They want to have full control over it so it completes at roughly consistent rate all the time.</div></div><hr />

Your donations do matter. Of course there is an underlying &quot;base&quot; progression rate because otherwise one faction could indefinitely stall out the warfront cycle, but your donations provide an additional rate of progress on top of this.</div></div><hr />

They either matter to an extend or there is a random range involved. Remember, EU Horde got their scenario alnost 1d earlier, even with the US Horde headstart due to server maintenance. And now US Alliance got it before EU Alliance. So it's shifting.</div></div><hr />

Nice hyperbole. That's 4 M+ dungeons? Are you saying you get the same amount of gear from 4 M+ dungeons as you do from 40?<br />
Yeah you can get a 370 piece, but you need to be lucky for it to be an actual itemlevel upgrade.<br />
<br />
What are you doing in those 2 hours that keeps your gear on-par with someone who raids heroic and pushes M+10?<br />

Horde outgear alliance because of warfronts &quot;by FAR&quot;? You can't be so delusional as to think some shitty 340s with a slight chance of titanforging is the reason for that (if its even true that horde outgears alliance).

You can't be so delusional as to think some shitty 340s with a slight chance of titanforging is the reason for that (if its even true that horde outgears alliance). Those same 340s that will be replaced after a few keystones and normal uldir.<br />
<br />
It basically did this... Horde was given iLevel 340 to start the game with. I mean in a couple hours they could have full 340+ gear. That means they were jamming mythics and pushing higher due to the welfare gearset. And getting better gear. This also means all their alts as well allowing for a greater raid diversity and flexibility. Raiding progression was skewed higher Horde than previous tiers.<br />
<br />
Basically how Blizz now gives catchup mechanisms each patch... Horde was given one at the start of the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If I'm not mistaken, based on my experience:<br />
- T1 is unranked chest rewards + airdrops (ilvl 325+)<br />
- T2 is warfronts (340+)<br />
- T3 is &quot;conquest points bar&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't know about ranked 'cause I don't do them, but htye probably award T2 / T3<br />
Not true, my conquest chest piece last week was definitely tier 2.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry, but you are the one not good with logic here.<br />
<br />
When Warfront was opened (which took ~5-6 days) everyone from Method and Limit had already farmed gear from Mythic+, rendering Warfront useless for gearing when it comes to actual World First race.<br />
<br />
After that, why would or should there be a rush in gearing up asap? I for one did Warfront only once, but it's so goddamn boring since there's no challenge whatsoever, that I went back to Mythic+, as it's more challenging and more rewarding.<br />

Yeah? How about Horde getting it first and there being NO minimum iLevel to participate? The Horde outgear Allioance because of this... by FAR.<br />
<br />
Warfront does not enable outgearing. Getting 340 gear is not outgearing. Getting 1x370 is not outgearing BY FAR. People that are in a hurry to gear up spam M+ and &quot;outgear&quot; others by doing that as much as possible.<br />
Warfront is, if anything, just there for Alts to &quot;catch-up&quot; and be able to raid after 2 days from hitting 120. (Getting 320 ilvl does not take that long, and if it does take several days for you, then the whole &quot;outgearing&quot; argument is kinda null...)</div></div><hr />

Man... it is such a simple concept but a few just can't get it.<br />
<br />
Horde didn't have an iLevel requirement. They added that after they saw what a clusterfreak it turned out to be. Certinaly Alliance were at 320 before they FINALLY got their chance to get into a warfront.<br />
<br />
The point is, literally within a few hours, Horde walked into Mythic+ in 340+ gear. This made is MUCH easy to push higher M+. Much easier to gear higher iLevel... before Alliance even got into a single warfront!<br />
<br />
Hordes progression was made laughably simple... and given the headstart to boot.<br />
<br />
I really don;t care as I didn;t buy BfA and am not going to. But to say Horde didn't have a pretty big advantage this expansion? Completely wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And here is why speaking out of ignorance a bad thing. It took Horde 1 week to even open up Warfront! That means that both Horde and Alliance had 4 weeks(!!) of time to gear up. 1 week before Warfront even opened for Horde both factions ran M+, Normal Raid and Heroic Raid. When Warfront got released (not opened mind you!), M+ got released as well. Do you seriously think that Alliance sat there for 1 week doing nothing because they didn't have access to Warfront?<br />
<br />
As I said, Warfront if anything is an alternativ method for alts to catch-up, because everyone else that played since BFA release had outgeared Warfront by then. So again, no, Horde did not get a &quot;Big Advantage&quot;, and by the time Warfront opened it was no use for the guilds that raced for World First or anyone that had been 120 for a week or longer. So no, Warfront did not enable outgearing. The only logic if Warfront enabled outgearing was if you HAD to do Warfront instead of Heroics and M0 to get gear.<br />
<br />
You are just clearly riding on the whine-wagon, complaining without even fact-checking your arguments first...<br />

Again, it took 1 week to open up Warfront. Horde had 1 week of time to push M+ as high as possible before they had access to Warfront. By the time Warfront opened they had already outgeared Warfront drops, so for gearing purposes Warfront was useless, except for 1 single item.

You do know that Method and Limit both are Horde faction, right? You do know that it wasn't gear alone that decided the progression? Gear helps, but it is most of the time not the deciding factor. If gear was the only factor in this, then how come there actually were Alliance guilds that was at 7/8 at the same time as Limit and Method? Did they secretly open/exploit into Warfront to outgear their fellow Alliance players?<br />
<br />
You can facepalm as much as you want, but you are grasping for straws. If you think 1x370 gear from Warfront makes such huge differense, then I will start believeing that you aren't even playing BFA.<br />
<br />
&quot;both have chance in M+, but with bad luck you might fked&quot;? That makes no sense at all. Both have chance? There's no chance in that. Both factions did farm M+ (both factions farmed M0 until M+ got unlocked). No one got &quot;bad luck you might fked&quot;, whatever that is supposed to mean. <br />
<br />
Now, if you read my full response, you might notice that getting 340 from Warfront DOES NOT EQUAL TO OUTGEARING. You can get your 340+ from Mythic0, so just go do that. You could get 340+ gear from PvP alone, so just go do that. Warfront is for alts to catch-up gearwise. Anyone that was 120 before Warfront got released (and had decent time to play) had good enough gear that it rendered Warfront completely worthless. I did not rush with my Shaman, but I had already outgeared Warfront that there was no point for me to do it when it got unlocked. Everyone complaining about it is just riding the whine-wagon that is ongoing.<br />
<br />
Stop thinking that Warfront is THE way to get high-end gear. It isn't. A friend of mine spammed Warfront to get his 340 gear, yet I outgeared him because I decided to do M+ instead, and PvP. When he had an average ilvl of 345 I was sitting at 355 already. You don't get 355 from Warfront alone, you average to 340, which is the same if you had farmed M0. <br />
Next time, skip the &quot;Still with me?&quot; bs, since clearly you don't understand the concept &quot;OUTGEARING&quot; or &quot;ADVANTAGE&quot;. I suggest you look it up. Horde getting advantage in getting M0 gear 1 week after M+ has been released? Just laughable.</div></div><hr />

Then I certainly stand corrected. You're right, what was I thinking! Blizzard always releases content with rewards that are already useless. Well in that case, it doesn't matter that warfronts provide useless junk.. in fact.. it seems like the only thing to actually play is M+... screw the rest of the game. Brilliant design!<br />

Warfronts could be ran doing absolutely nothing... getting 340-370 gear... You just spam it and completely gear out going AFK.<br />
<br />
FACT. So while maybe some dummy was running M+... some other dude was sitting in Warfronts getting dozens of gear items getting war and titan forge procs.</div></div><hr />

You're right, what was I thinking! Blizzard always releases content with rewards that are already useless. Well in that case, it doesn't matter that warfronts provide useless junk.. in fact.. it seems like the only thing to actually play is M+... screw the rest of the game. Brilliant design!<br />

I never said Warfront was good Game Design. On the contratry, I've complained that Warfront is useless and boring, as there's no challenge in it.<br />
<br />
Also; FACT. So while maybe some dummy was running Warfront... some other dude was farming M+ getting 360+ ilvl items getting war and titan forge procs.<br />
Your point was that Warfront was about outgearing, while the ilvl on the gear is the same as M0, which, as I stated, people already had from doing M0 prior it being released, and did 1 week of M+ and Uldir before Warfront opened.<br />

I'll link whatever I want. My point, &quot;fact&quot;, is that you could completely gear out in 2 hours and easily push M10+. You could not do that starting in Mythic.</div></div><hr />
