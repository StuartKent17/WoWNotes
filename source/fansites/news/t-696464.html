There is a nice interview of Tom Chilton (http://gameinformer.com/games/world_of_warcraft_wrath_of_the_lich_king/b/pc/archive/2010/02/17/afterwords-world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king.aspx) (Kalgan) on Gameinformer.com (http://www.gameinformer.com). We learn a couple of new things here, including an almost-confirmed upcoming single-boss raid encounter: The Ruby Sanctum in the Chamber of Aspects under the Wyrmrest Temple. <br />
<br />
The Dungeon Finder tool might be extended &quot;at the very least&quot; to 10-person raids at some point in the future.<br />
The next addition to raid content will probably be a single-boss encounter in the Ruby Sanctum of the Chamber of Aspects. &quot;It’s a little too early to have a lot of details on that, but I wouldn’t characterize it as a huge chunk of content. [...] I think of it more as an extension of patch 3.3.&quot;<br />
<br />
They are the two major announcements of the interview, I suggest that you read the full article on GameInformer.com (http://gameinformer.com/games/world_of_warcraft_wrath_of_the_lich_king/b/pc/archive/2010/02/17/afterwords-world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king.aspx) if you want to read the rest, there are a couple of interesting commentaries about Wrath of the Lich King's development after the original release and how it will affect Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Making end-level content more approachable has been another big change for the game. It’s easier to get more powerful badge gear, you created the Dungeon Finder tool, etc. I know there’s always been that hardcore versus casual debate that rages on the WOW forums, where some people hate that stuff and some people love it. How do you feel like the general feedback among WOW players has been?<br />
<br />
The general feedback has been positive. We definitely plan to keep going in the direction that we’re going right now. We’re really happy with the Dungeon Finder. I’d like to find a way to extend that at the very least to 10-person raids at some point in the future. There are a lot of complexities with making that work, but anything we can do to alleviate the annoyances or pains associated with players having to arrange their own groups would be great. Being able to extend that into raiding would be awesome if we could do it.<br />
<br />
We also have plans to continue making PvP more accessible also. It’s interesting that in Burning Crusade our raiding game was extremely hardcore, and in a lot of ways the PvP was a lot more casual player-friendly. Through the course of Lich King, those have flipped around. A lot of that is just because of the development in our PvE game. We had really aggressive development in solving the problems that we saw in PvE in Burning Crusade as far as making PvE more accessible and easier to get into and more rewarding. Almost simultaneously, PvP either stayed the same or got more hardcore in some ways.<br />
<br />
Those flipped roles in Lich King, and we really want to balance them out better than we have before in Cataclysm. We want to continue to advance on that front with PvE, and with PvP we really want to make sure that it feels better-balanced against PvP as far as how much effort it takes to organize stuff and how much reward you get for your time and effort spent.[/b]<br />
<br />
For the final question, there’s been some rumors going around and I wanted to clear them up. You guys have wrapped up the main Lich King storyline. Icecrown is out there, which you guys have said is the final major raid for this expansion. But there are some rumors that there might be another content patch of some sort before Cataclysm releases.<br />
<br />
That is a possibility. We can’t say for sure at this point, but we are looking into the possibility of having a boss in the Ruby Sanctum, which is another part of Wyrmrest Temple. It’s a little too early to have a lot of details on that, but I wouldn’t characterize it as a huge chunk of content. It’s not a patch 3.4 or anything.</div></div><hr />

Please don't make it like Malygos or Ony. Those were boring raids. Give us some mini-bosses, give us some hard modes, etc.</div></div><hr />

I REALLY hope that's what the ruby raid will be about. Otherwise it makes the least sense of all of the other chambers. Green, bronze, blue, they would all make sense. Nightmare, infinite, and Malygos followers.<br />

Either the Black Dragons in their base, stealin' all their eggs.<br />

I am aware that they might make a more powerfull need/greed tool - but still. <br />
<br />
I think that Blizzard did alot for the casual community, and I myself enjoy that at the moment since I was recently hacked and had to level up from scratch - I would not have done that if it was Vanilla grindin I had to do. <br />
<br />
But I seriously think that if they keep up this track - meh. <br />

<br />
I didn't read it, thanks for pointing it out.<br />

<br />
More than anything else with Ulduar, I think it was just bigger than it needed to be and more hardcore than it needed to be. Those were the biggest lessons for us along with making the connection to the main story arc clearer if there’s going to be one.<br />
<br />
Wow, they regret something about the best raid instance in the WotLk except ICC (which I can't really judge since I quitted before the second wing was released). Ulduar was just very well tuned in both normal and hard modes, and very well desgined as well.<br />
Nice, this really doesn't give me hope for Cataclysm anymore.</div></div><hr />

Shame that they thought it was too hard core, Yogg was a perfect fight. Anub was way too easy and just boring.</div></div><hr />

I'm sticking with it. Here's the set up: Nalice has access to Alexstrasza on the pretense of cooperating against Arthas, but has really all along been observing and seeing signs of weakness and opportunity for Deathwing to return. With Arthas dead and gone, the moment to strike has come -- she attacks from within and takes control of the Ruby Sanctum. We're there to remove her for Alexstrasza. When she dies, everyone will get to let out a huge sigh of relief that things didn't get farther and there's no reason to think Deathwing is coming back.<br />
<br />
If that's true, the achievement for killing her needs to be named &quot;Nalice Doesn't Live Here Anymore&quot;.</div></div><hr />

One of the best encounters that is just a dps race before the drakes become active, right. I don't even need to mention the countless problems it had when it was first released.<br />

Besides, an encounter that involves multiple boss's in one fight is now overused.<br />

i figured theyd do something like Alexstraza giving you a quest &quot;oh noez the ruby sanctum is under attack by some meanies and even though i have 139 bajillion HP in dragon form, i cant go down and help stop it cuz im a quest giver so i need you to do it, heres 15 gold plzkthx&quot;</div></div><hr />

Idd.. I loved Ulduar.. enjoyed every single fight. Was looking forward for more raids like this in Cataclysm, but now reading this post I realise the only thing we'll get is ToC-like raids. Also they will upgrade Dungeon Finder for 25man raids so yeah why have a guild anymore when you can just pug everything? Only for the guild talents and crap? Meh...</div></div><hr />

No I'm happy with another single-boss raid, and maybe Blizz would think about having it drop a decent healing trinket since there are none of those in ICC. And another Valithria-like fight would be welcome :)</div></div><hr />

What happens is - Alexstrasa will eat a poisoned apple in her ruby sanktum. Her powers will then drain, you will go see her and she'll tell you to inspect the ruby sanctem. When you go there you'll see<br />
<br />
A BUNCH OF DANCING TROLLS<br />
<br />
ZOMG<br />
<br />
The trolls under teh influence of drakkari poisened all of alexstrasa bootiful garden. AND NOW THEY HAVE BREAK DANCING TOURNYS. Nah not really, they use the area for powarfull magixs. They harness fire and fiery magixxs to ward off players from stopping dem. And while the worshippers try to summon drakkari to this world the players have to stop them by severing the cults ties to the old god. <br />
<br />
But hang on wasn't that like zg where you'd kill the troll dudes and hakkar got easier?<br />
<br />
NOOOO because suprise suprise drakkari makes it out alive, and gets stronger every second!!!<br />
<br />
the players must kill him as soon as possible before he becomes too strong and wipes out the raid with powerful moves like<br />
<br />
BRAKEDANCE MOJO - Aoe knock back (serisouly how cool would that be? he does a breakdance windmill and ppl get knocked back)<br />
<br />
BURNING FIRE IN WATER GOBLET - Player starts getting consumed by flames, while in a goblet of water. Damage is taken over time and time attack speed and casting speed is slowed, and stacks every time drakkari buffs. Not dispellable and COMPLETELY RNG.<br />
<br />
MAKE BADS CLEAR CATA IN 264 - This spell is epic, what it does is it makes the fight completely trivial, making all those lazor beams, deep breaths, shockwaves do 10% of their intended damage. So the bads that don't understand the fight the first few 50 times dont die when they 'forget to move out of fire' since it only ticks for 5 hp every 2 minutes. That way if it drops a mount as well every bad on the realm will want to be raid leader so they can ninja the 1% drake. Also its no longer a drake ITS AN RIDEABLE HAKKAR MOUNT.<br />
<br />

that's all I can say.<br />
They should have added that boss together with totc, not now after the lich king?<br />
WHat are they gonna do, make it drop some super epic items everyone needs.<br />
It destroys the whole feeling of raiding ICC.<br />
<br />
As I expected this is just a filler to keep people entertained until cata release in november or something.<br />
You fail blizz, you make good games but this one is a fail.<br />

And yeah, it's probably Neltharion (Deathwing)'s flight attacking the Ruby Sanctum to get hold of an item of value to their flight, possible to make contact with Deathwing or awaken him, and we're probably gonna be &quot;indirectly&quot; responsible for the Cataclysm. Just like that whole Loken-Algalon thing...<br />

Anyways, hope it's 264 content atleast, I really don't want a raid that is lower than ICC, but defintly don't want one that is higher. Equal or slightly lower.</div></div><hr />

Here's my opinion though, and it's kind of a long shot. Yeah Nalice is just a mole in the council for Deathwing and the reason she infiltrates the ruby dragon shrine is because due to it being the shrine of the ruby queen, it holds immense power.

But all single boss raids where dragon raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, it seems interesting. The attacker (new raid boss) will most likely be a raid boss in Cataclysm as well, in a different place. Although I do not really hope for this kind of a boss.<br />

I want an Ember Wyrm Boss already.</div></div><hr />

Is it'll probably wreck a lot of 10man guilds. If a player can do a 10man without needing a guild then that guild won't be able to hold players. <br />

Blizzard has to be careful. Raid content is a guilds bread and butter, its what holds them together.</div></div><hr />

Wowwiki:<br />

There's a lot of red, or Ruby if you like, drakes guarding along the way up to Grim Batol.<br />

Wowwiki about Grim Batol:<br />
&quot;In the novel Night of the Dragon, it is revealed that Deathwing, the insane Black Aspect and ancient enemy of Alexstrasza, resides deep inside Grim Batol.&quot;<br />

The drakes would come after 90 secs or so. So you had to kill each dragon within 90 secs.<br />

I think of it more as an extension of patch 3.3.<br />

I want to grab Blizzard, shake them and say &quot;don't you see what you are doing?&quot;. Games have always been about challenge, it's a chat room or something the like if there's no proper challenges. A casual player doesn't need to see all of the game's content. Isn't that quite logical? I'm casual myself, I don't want to see all content. There should be raids that I can't access or can only down couple first bosses. For the same reason I don't become a professional guitar player, I don't spend enough time on it. I've played WoW for long time and I still like it, but patch by patch the game becomes more bland and easy. Anyone saying that is good thing is simply stupid or has joined gaming after millennium and is stupid. Sorry, but it's true.<br />
<br />
EVE Online that started as a indie project and was looking pretty bad at the start is growing after seven or so years and it hasn't lost it's spark. Why? Because it's damn difficult. It's extreme though, WoW should find a balance. TBC was pretty balanced when it comes to raiding and there were a bunch of great, fun raids. Please, Blizzard, wake up. Most actual gamers want challenges and REASONABLE casuals settle for seeing &quot;only&quot; most of the content, but not all.</div></div><hr />

Just give us cataclysm beta QQ<br />
<br />
If they are going to progress like i feel by releasing each one of the sanctums every few months up untill cataclysm then none raiders may aswell quit untill the cataclysm release.<br />
<br />
Its basically just a cheap trick to keep players subscribed with the minimal amount of content updates on offer.<br />
<br />
Cataclysm is obviously more than 6months away thanks to the lack of beta so i guess it will be a boring 6months for none raiders...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, because that was always what happened after the release of a new raid, the next wouldn't come until some months later.<br />
They already sped up that process in WotLK, compared to BC, so sit tf down and enjoy and finish your current meal instead of just clearing the first wing and then scream for &quot;new content&quot;.</div></div><hr />

But WotlK came right after... Zul Aman is the most forgotten raid now i think ;-) So no telling how fast Cataclysm will arrive after the next (small) raid expansion.<br />
<br />
2) - Random-raid-finder for 10 mans... I hope they will NOT include the latest raids in there... i hate to see pugs wipe on every single boss in ICC10 now...<br />
The &quot;Lower&quot; content like; Naxx - OS - EoE - Ulduar and ToC are ok to find random players.<br />
The &quot;Bigger&quot; raids (Naxx &amp; Ulduar) should be divided into seperate smaller raids per wing / part<br />
And will they do the typical 2T-3H-5D setup or leave room to tinker....<br />
And what about special needs? (Interupters on for example Faction Champs, dispellers, CC-ers, rogues to find traps)</div></div><hr />

Doesn't this pretty much confirm; if it hasn't already, that there is also going to be a 3.4 along with this 3.3.x (Ruby Sanctum) which means that a troll raid could still be a possibility?<br />
<br />
If so that ties in better with<br />

... but I wouldn’t characterize it as a huge chunk of content ...<br />

I'm thinking something along the lines of the Sanctum has been attacked, and its Keeper subdued. Now, you must heal her up, like Dreamwalker, so you can get rid of the invaders. Maybe it's being attacked by Scourge, Black Dragons, Gorlocs, Trolls, Baby Seals, who knows?</div></div><hr />

A dungeon with a big Dragon inside is the classic RPG element, it'll never ever get old :) It just works!<br />
If its a red dragon, though I doubt it because as mentioned before insanity has been used to much. I'd guess it'll be another big fire aoe fest.<br />
But more likely we'll help a red dragon against some other force, perhaps a prologue for Cata so its some black flight stragglers? <br />
Have to keep the red dragon alive while she/he fights another big ass black dragon, while we also keep swarms of smaller ones busy thats coming in waves. Or something like that.</div></div><hr />

Alas, WoW isn't just aimed at this kind of player. New 5mans come with expansions, and maybe some inbetween (Maraudon, Dire Maul, Magister's Terrace, Trial of the Champion, the 3 Icecrown ones) but if you don't do dailies, pvp or raids, you're gonna be very, very bored. And that's completely intended.<br />
You, on the other hand, act like you watch a TV show, and after the opening sequence you complain that there isn't more of that music and quick cuts of scenes, instead of boring talking and story.</div></div><hr />

c) How will we flush out the bads?<br />
<br />
<br />
If you don't want to deal with &quot;bads&quot; then don't pug by any method. Is it really that horrible if one or two people in your raid are not the best players in the game? Of course, obviously, the vast majority of guilds and pugs are not the best players in the game. DEAL WITH IT! <br />
<br />
On another note, I can see this doing damage to a lot of guilds. Why be in a guild if you can raid at any given time just by joining a raid finder? Of course, this would also mean the end of lock outs, hopefully. Raid lock outs are by far the stupidest concept that Blizzard ever came up with (seeing its one of the only unique concepts they ever had I'm not that surprised...Blizzard is at its best when its fine polishing stolen ideas not when it is creating new ones). <br />
<br />
Personally, although I feel that Blizzard will never bust guilds apart intentionally, I for one would absolutely love it if there was never a reason to be in a guild. I hate guilds. I think the downfall of most online games is guilds. Games should be more focused on the individual player not some sort of collective BS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard only puts hard modes into the game for the &quot;hardcore&quot; whiners that want to have a &quot;challenge&quot; (because all they have to brag about in their lives is how well they can do in a video game). Eventually, Blizzard will wise up and realize you can NEVER please these &quot;hardcore&quot; whiners and cater to the masses. Don't be surprised if we see hard modes phased out completely in an upcoming expansion. Especially if they are intent on making this game be much more player friendly (catering to the masses).</div></div><hr />

Could likely be another eventuality, but here's some speculation at least.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daez</div><div class="date">2010-02-19, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you not read the part where he said that ulduar was too hardcore ? . Wtf. I loved ulduar because it was not just another pugfuck. (atleast 25 hm's) - Don't take that away aswell.. <br />
<br />
<br />
Uludar, for the time and place it was in the continuation of the expansion WAS to hardcore. If they were smart, Blizzard wouldn't implement hard modes until the final dungeon. I have no problem with hard modes being in a final dungeon of an expansion, but they have NO place in the rest of the raiding arc for that expansion. Uludar did a crap load of damage to this expansion. They had to release TOC with superior gear because most people didn't even bother to finish Uludar (especially in hard modes). Blizzard has caught on to the fact that the majority of players want easy raids where they can get easy epics and that will eventually push out the hardcore players. <br />
<br />
Of course, hard modes do belong in the final arc because by the time most people have managed to clear them they will be absolutely pointless to clear anyways (new expansion with completely new gear). Then again it could be argued that the same is true of all hard modes in this expansion (by the time you managed to clear hard modes there was no point to clear them because the new gear in the next patch was easier to get and better gear).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And the 10 man lfg.. Seriously, it sounds so retardet. <br />
<br />
<br />
10 man and 25 man raids will eventually be available through the looking for group tool. &quot;Hardcore&quot; players are gradually being shoved out of the way so that Blizzard can cater to those that actually pay the bills instead of the 10%. This was obvious. Why the hell do you think Blizzard &quot;reasigned&quot; Tigole (hardcore elitist fanatic) to an online card playing game? Blizzard was sick of losing money by catering to &quot;hardcore&quot; players. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PallaPalla - X-realm says: Ooops .. Missclicked..<br />
PallaPalla - X-realm Recieves Monster epic mount<br />
PallaPalla - X-realm Leaves the group. <br />
---<br />
<br />
<br />
This example is bogus because in a pug raid with open random loot you are ALL going to roll need on anything you want. If you don't roll need on it you are beyond stupid. As for your other example, even guilds have players that stand in the fires. The truth is that its hard to fill out 25 man raids for the amount of people that want to raid unless you take 1-5 bad players to just fill the damn raid. Stuff still gets accomplished. Deal with it!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I think that Blizzard did alot for the casual community, and I myself enjoy that at the moment since I was recently hacked and had to level up from scratch - I would not have done that if it was Vanilla grindin I had to do. <br />
<br />
<br />
I call BS. Blizzard has ALWAYS returned everything to players that legitimately got hacked. Either 1) you bought your account from a plethora of different websites or 2) you weren't hacked and are making this up as a way to say you were better than everyone before but not now cause you were umm... &quot;hacked.&quot; Hell, they even return everything if you nerd rage delete your characters. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But I seriously think that if they keep up this track - meh. <br />
<br />
<br />
They are keeping it up. They are tired of trying to please people, such as yourself, that, lets face it, are NEVER pleased. They have lost countless amounts of money trying to do that, and in the end they finally realized where the money comes from and are going to cater to those players.</div></div><hr />

OS was always fun for reasons i dont know<br />
<br />
<br />
It was fun because it was incredibly easy unless you wanted to make it harder and then it had various degrees of hard (not just switch on=hard and switch off=easy). It also took less than 30 minutes to get some really awesome loot. It was fun for many of the same reasons that VOA (like it or hate it) is fun. People love to have free gear thrown at them then complain because free gear is thrown at others. Its just how MMOs work.</div></div><hr />

No I'm happy with another single-boss raid, and maybe Blizz would think about having it drop a decent healing trinket since there are none of those in ICC. And another Valithria-like fight would be welcome :)<br />
<br />
<br />
One of the best healing trinkets available is bought with badges. The others drop in ICC 5H. Seriously, you can't be whining about a lack of decent healing trinkets.</div></div><hr />

Thats also what i think he ment, they do feel like they were all done in the wrong order. Totc is like a backward step in difficulty in terms of scale and difficulty after doing ulduar hardmodes. Its all went a bit out of line there</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This really can't surprise you. ICC was actually a challenge to the elitist of the elites and in true gaming fashion that means most people already stopped worrying about it. This new dungeon will be super easy compared to ICC on easy mode and will throw loot at us that is equivalent to loot dropped by the Lich King himself. Blizzard knows where its money comes from and more people quit because this game is to &quot;hard&quot; than quit because its to &quot;easy.&quot; At a certain point, beating your head against the wall ceases to be fun unless you already lack brain activity.<br />
<br />

<br />
As I expected this is just a filler to keep people entertained until cata release in november or something.<br />
You fail blizz, you make good games but this one is a fail.<br />
Learn from your mistakes and you would do so much better.<br />
<br />
<br />
I still think that Cataclysm will release in August at the latest. The whole thing screams summer from a marketing ploy, and Blizzard has the best marketing team available (its the true secret to their success...they aren't the best game just the best marketed one).</div></div><hr />

Try to figure out the strat for Sarth 3D before it becomes zergable.<br />
<br />
<br />
IT WAS ALWAYS A DPS RACE. All strats related to, burn this drake before the next one comes. That means they all required a DPS race. Of course, it could be argued that 99.9% of raiding is a dps race. If you don't have the dps then it becomes a healer/mana balance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You can not possibly be this clueless. THE ONLY REASON THE ZERG WORKS is because the drakes activate every 45 seconds. It has nothing to do with percentage. If it did, you would not be able to do the zerg method because you would have three drakes on you before you got Sarth down.</div></div><hr />

I guess that's why i assumed it was based on % of Sartharions health.<br />

Games have always been about challenge, it's a chat room or something the like if there's no proper challenges.<br />
<br />
<br />
No, games have always been about FUN. Name one single game that was truly successful that was truly challenging. Here is a hint: THERE ISN'T ONE!! Games cater to the masses, and the masses want something that is time consuming but easily beatable. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A casual player doesn't need to see all of the game's content. Isn't that quite logical?<br />
<br />
<br />
If you only go to the store once a week you shouldn't be able to buy the same quality as someone that goes there every single day is able to buy. You should be charged the same price of course, but you shouldn't get the same quality. Isn't that quite logical? (Wait...you mean its not, then how come you think we shouldn't get what we pay for in a game, but I'm betting you would complain like crazy in any place that wasn't the game).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm casual myself, I don't want to see all content. There should be raids that I can't access or can only down couple first bosses. For the same reason I don't become a professional guitar player, I don't spend enough time on it. I've played WoW for long time and I still like it, but patch by patch the game becomes more bland and easy. Anyone saying that is good thing is simply stupid or has joined gaming after millennium and is stupid. Sorry, but it's true.<br />
<br />
<br />
Either you are lying or you are in the minority. Using your example. Lets say, you spend years paying for guitar lessons, but you still have no clue how to play the guitar. Do you stop paying for lessons or not? That is the real question.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
EVE Online that started as a indie project and was looking pretty bad at the start is growing after seven or so years and it hasn't lost it's spark. Why? Because it's damn difficult. It's extreme though, WoW should find a balance.<br />
<br />
<br />
It couldn't have anything to do with it being the ONLY MMO out there that markets to space fans could it? Nah, that can't possibly be it. After Star Trek Online gets off the ground and starts to become successful please return with that analogy. Until then, it is simply spurious correlation.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
TBC was pretty balanced when it comes to raiding and there were a bunch of great, fun raids.<br />
<br />
<br />
TBC was &quot;balanced?&quot; You have to be kidding. 90% of the population not seeing the end game content, 50% of the population never getting past Karazhan until the final patch, and 25% quitting out of pure disgust at the catering to &quot;hardcore&quot; players is balanced to you?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Please, Blizzard, wake up. Most actual gamers want challenges and REASONABLE casuals settle for seeing &quot;only&quot; most of the content, but not all.<br />
<br />
<br />
They did wake up. They felt guilty for spending development dollars that came from 90% of the population on content they would NEVER see.</div></div><hr />

I hope they will NOT include the latest raids in there... i hate to see pugs wipe on every single boss in ICC10 now...<br />
The &quot;Lower&quot; content like; Naxx - OS - EoE - Ulduar and ToC are ok to find random players.<br />
The &quot;Bigger&quot; raids (Naxx &amp; Ulduar) should be divided into seperate smaller raids per wing / part<br />
And will they do the typical 2T-3H-5D setup or leave room to tinker....<br />
And what about special needs? (Interupters on for example Faction Champs, dispellers, CC-ers, rogues to find traps)<br />
<br />
<br />
The random system will still have gear matching, and yes the top tier should be included. The new raid structure, as hinted at by Blizzard, will look something more like 1T-2H-7D. They are really trying to get away from requiring a crap load of healers and tanks in the average raid because they finally realized very few people actually enjoy playing tanks and healers as compared to dps. Almost every class has some sort of interupt ability. Every healer class gets remove magic in Cataclysm and there are plenty of ways to offensively dispel. There are few fights in this game that actually require CC. Hopefully, Blizzard will realize how stupid the &quot;lets force them to have a rouge in the raid&quot; concept was, and even now you don't NEED a rogue to find traps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Please, show me a single quote by Blizzard, that says that that is completely intended. EVERYTHING they have quoted recently is JUST the opposite, and don't be surprised when there is a new dungeon and new question zone released with every single patch in Cataclysm. Oh, and btw, that was the case in classic. They opened the zones slowly for exactly the type of player you are disagreeing with.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You, on the other hand, act like you watch a TV show, and after the opening sequence you complain that there isn't more of that music and quick cuts of scenes, instead of boring talking and story.<br />
<br />
<br />
FOR YOU, raiding is the television show. For other players, raiding is the ending credits (they have no desire to watch them at all) and the quests/dungeons are the actual television show. Blizzard will continue to cater to both you and the other person.</div></div><hr />

Really, I think where we are at now is just fine - if you want something more hardcore then go find another MMO as WoW was designed to be less hardcore than its predecessors and if you want something more casual just go buy a DVD set or something to entertain your laughably small attention span and patience.</div></div><hr />

Wrong. <br />
<br />
Sartharion wasn't zergable on 25m 3D before high-end T8/T9. In T7, you actually had to deal with each drake, their henchmen behind the portal, their buffs to Sarth and the usual mechanics of the fight before killing the boss, thus making the encounter challenging.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't this pretty much confirm; if it hasn't already, that there is also going to be a 3.4 along with this 3.3.x (Ruby Sanctum) which means that a troll raid could still be a possibility?<br />

Well, it depends on you believing what Blizz said or not.<br />

I loved it, and its 10-man version was very challening, before Ulduar was released. I don't see how can you call it a DPS race :p<br />
Killing the first two drakes was a DPS race, but that's just part of a bigger and complex fight. And even while killing the first drakes you had few other stuff going on. People who love to stay in the fire don't like Sartharion 3D :P</div></div><hr />

I think we'll fight Alexstrazsa in the Ruby Sanctum. Bear with me here.<br />
<br />
She hasn't gone nuts or anything. Feeling the oncoming cataclysm (though not being sure of it's exact nature), she feels the need to test herself in battle to make sure she's strong enough to assist the world she's sworn to protect. So she decides to test herself against powerful heroes.<br />

To that end, we wouldn't kill her, she would simply yield at a certain percentage. She would have an enrage timer, but as opposed to her berserking, she would port everyone to the Sanctum entrance, scolding them for not fighting hard enough.<br />
<br />

10man raids with Dungeon Finder?<br />
<br />
Are you insane?<br />
<br />
a) Will they have a cooldown?<br />
b) How many bads do you expect to bring?<br />
c) How will we flush out the bads?<br />
d) FUUUUUUUUU.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well all of us who never get a chance because we don't have an achivement or measure up to the elites way of thinking need to have a way to do it as well. And where is the problem - you do it and have a cooldown - just like normal, except you get a group across the battlezone. Its about time they do that.</div></div><hr />

Malygos, Sartharion his little dudes may technically count as bosses but Im not buying it just cause they dropped badges. New Onyxia and now whatever dragon we fight in there. Dragons really seem to have trouble finding strong friends to help them out.<br />

I want to grab Blizzard, shake them and say &quot;don't you see what you are doing?&quot;. Games have always been about challenge, it's a chat room or something the like if there's no proper challenges. A casual player doesn't need to see all of the game's content. Isn't that quite logical? I'm casual myself, I don't want to see all content. There should be raids that I can't access or can only down couple first bosses. For the same reason I don't become a professional guitar player, I don't spend enough time on it. I've played WoW for long time and I still like it, but patch by patch the game becomes more bland and easy. Anyone saying that is good thing is simply stupid or has joined gaming after millennium and is stupid. Sorry, but it's true.<br />
<br />
EVE Online that started as a indie project and was looking pretty bad at the start is growing after seven or so years and it hasn't lost it's spark. Why? Because it's damn difficult. It's extreme though, WoW should find a balance. TBC was pretty balanced when it comes to raiding and there were a bunch of great, fun raids. Please, Blizzard, wake up. Most actual gamers want challenges and REASONABLE casuals settle for seeing &quot;only&quot; most of the content, but not all.<br />
<br />
OK, I'm going to say this in the nicest possible way. Your definitions of &quot;casual&quot; is *completely* skewed. If you have a) Cleared Ulduar on 10 or 25 mode past any of the keepers b) Finished ToC 25 or even 10 c) Passed Marrowgar in ICC 10 let alone 25, then you are doing better than 70% of the WoW population. I pulled that number out of my ass, but I'd actually be surprised if it wasn't higher. Seriously, most people *still* find the content hard.<br />
<br />
My guild is a bunch of great people. I like them. We're not awesome at the game. We cleared the Keepers while they were relevant in ten man, finished ToC 10, and have cleared through Saurfang in ICC 10. We're nothing special, but we try. Nearly every one of our mains is in the top 500 for the realm on WoW-Heroes. Several of us have more than one toon in the top 500. There are 20,000 toons listed at level 80 on Wow-Heroes for my server, representing between 5-10 thousand actual accounts, and people from my scruby little ten man guild are all in the top 500, I'm personally in the top 100. Gear score is not skill of course, but if you have a better gear score than someone, it's quite likely that you've played through more content than they have (unless they've gotten really unlucky). <br />
<br />
By &quot;dumbing down&quot; the game to the point that they have, Blizzard has gone from letting the top 5-10% see raid content while it's relevant to letting maybe the top 30-40% see it. They *still* aren't catering to even the *majority* of the player base, let alone the worst scrubs out there. Is it reasonable to expect that everyone will see all the content? No, of course not. There has to be some level of skill involved or people get bored. Is it reasonable to expect at least 30 or 40% to see all the content? I think it probably is.</div></div><hr />

Now I'm sure that some pugs will go horribly so I say that an hour and a half in to two hours in you get a message if you have still not cleared the boss your on to disband the group with out any repercussions. That or have it so you can que for a full run vs a farm run. Just asking because it pisses me off when some one skips to the last boss in old kingdoms because that place is worth 7 emblems and they just throw it all away for there 2 frost ones :P</div></div><hr />

Assign loot lock outs per boss you kill that week. That way if you get into a horrible pug that kills 1 or 2 bosses and then collapses, you can still go into a fresh run or one that may have 4 or 5 down. In the fresh run, you won't be able to get any items from the bosses you already killed for the week, but at least you have a shot at the others. If you go into the one that has more bosses down than you, it would operate like it does now and locks you out of those bosses with the more progressed raid ID. However, even that system will still have many negatives that would need to be weighed.</div></div><hr />

With the new expansion having a dragon as the main bad guy...I think we should get to know whats going on with these guys a little more. <br />

With difficulty of raids, ICC is pretty tough stuff, not everyone has even gotten past 6/12 encounters in there... The guild that I am in finally 10/12 bosses and that was because we were on a roll last night. So i can't say some lowly guild with a bunch of scrubs is going to get that far in ICC. One little mistake causes the whole raid to go down in to the shitter. <br />
<br />
I am excited they are still putting stuff in and not charging for it still. <br />

No troll raid does kind of suck... But i guess another &quot;Dragon&quot; will be fun... Stay away from tail, void zones, cleave breath, and the same old mechanics. This should be do able for a lot of people.... lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
TBC been hardcore pve, is the blue retarded I know absolutely loads of people who were running kara and ZA who didn't have the time for 25man progression.<br />
<br />
I don't mind what they have done with ICC there is some difficulty in the end wing bosses, but anyone with a brain can do the non end wing bosses. What pisses me off more than anything is the sheer amount of ways to get raiding vendor items there is simply no need for it. VOA is a joke for both pve and pvp players. <br />

I never knew people couldn't get passed kara in tbc since i did it with blues on several chars. I'm sorry but out of that 90%, were alts that the players didn't care and the rest probably skipped karazhan. U CANNOT seriously claim karazhan was that hard. TBC was decent, not saying it was perfect (we've all seen 2.4 and most prooly know that ZA was their atempt to kill 2 birds with 1 stone, solving the amani lore + cheap gear for casuals and overall boosting for Sunwell + BT too soon and other faults) but it wasn't that hard as vanilla, dunno if u have played back then but that was hardcore tailored not TBC. Would also like to point out that contrary to what u've said the population of WoW continued to grow in TBC (and had i think it's biggest growth), while guess what in Wotlk it is atm stagnating. Yes u can blame this perhaps on the fact that people are getting bored of the game as they do of anything, but is that the only thing? Doubt it. It's not all bad u did have good points about the rest of what that guy said.<br />

BLEAH! This is laaaaame. But as i assumed all along, in case u didn't notice in wotlk they've added dungeons and content in general after they had done something off the game (in comics or books) to introduce the content. This is it the introduction to Cataclysm: Be Happy!!! it will probably suck as an encounter but it will be full of lore! It's not meant to introduce a new mechanic or to be a ground breaking instance, it's meant to tell newbies and the rest of us a bit about Deathwing and what's going to happen in Cataclysm and shizzle. Probably the spark of the Cataclysm will be in here (as someone above stated). <br />

That's what made most (if not all, except for who didn't read the text) believe that we would find him inside ICC (or ICC5 instances) trying to kill the Lich King.<br />
<br />
In the end, we came and did the job before he could do it. So he'll probably be very pissed with us in a, maybe, who knows, new burning legion related (and end of story line for it) xpac after Cataclysm. :P<br />
<br />
<br />
So basically you assumed too much on your part, then want to put blame for his absence on Blizzards decision on lore because your expectations were betrayed... Good choice.<br />

<br />
This is the farthest thing from 'logical' I can think of, it more closely resembles communist Russia, whereby the privileged only gain access to certain aspects of the game. I am a newbie, have only been raiding seriously for a year or so, but I am doing all the heroic content that seasoned players have been doing for years..idk.. but getting out of fire seemed logical right off the bat, so the simple mechanics of wow were not that hard to grasp, but it definitely doesn’t detract from the fun of the game, not by a longshot. <br />
<br />
The problem is, if you do not have access to other skilled players, i.e. being in a guild (a good guild), you obviously cant partake in the content..I have tried to no avail; to solo Ulduar, but damnit.. I keep getting one shotted, and inevitably have to rely on other players to advance *sigh*<br />
<br />
There are maybe 4% of guilds (9% of players)* who actually breeze through these encounters, leaving 91% of the 'rest of us' to enjoy ourselves, I vote that the top players and guilds go find another game :) that would solve all these issues.<br />
<br />
