Reminder - Mists of Pandaria Press Tour Next Week<br />
We are getting closer to the March 13-15 Mists of Pandaria Press Tour which will bring even more new Mists of Pandaria information! The NDA on the info revealed during the tour lifts on March 19 and will hopefully followed by the Alpha/Beta test shortly after. You can still discuss the new expansion in our Mists of Pandaria General Discussions Forum (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/340-Mists-of-Pandaria-General-Discussions) and check out the Mists of Pandaria Blizzcon 2011 Summary (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1007250-Mists-of-Pandaria-Blizzcon-2011-Summary) for a recap of what we already know.<br />
<br />
In any case, it's only 2 weeks before things get interesting again, stay tuned! <br />
<br />
<br />
Statistics: Thori'dal, the Stars' Fury<br />
Today we take a look at the rate at which people are acquiring Thori'dal, the Stars' Fury (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/34334/thoridal-the-stars-fury/)! The sample size was ~5.8 million level 85 characters with a total of ~8,400 that have the achievement. You can find an alternative form of the graph in the comments (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1091409-Mists-of-Pandaria-Press-Tour-Soon-Thori-dal-Statistics-War-College-The-Daily-Blink?p=15761730&amp;viewfull=1#post15761730), broken down by class. <br />
<br />
It's very interesting to see that even if you can't transmogrify legendary items, the announcement of Transmogrification at the end of August considerably increased the amount of people farming old raid instances such as Sunwell for gear. <br />

War College - Isle of Conquest<br />
The battlefields of World of Warcraft are littered with the bones of those who have become casualties in the ongoing conflict between the Horde and the Alliance. You do not need to become one of them. One of the keys to victory is knowledge, and that is where the World of Warcraft War College enters the picture. In these discussions between players, you can learn and share strategies with other players to improve your tactics and improve your odds of emerging victorious from the field of battle.<br />
<br />
Are you a veteran Gladiator with countless victories tallied? Are you new to World of Warcraft and striving to improve your PvP skills? In this weekly feature, we invite players of all skill levels to ask questions, share tips and tactics, and join a conversation dedicated to surviving and thriving in World of Warcraft PvP.<br />
<br />
This week, the topic of discussion is:<br />
Isle of Conquest - Which strategies are most effective in Isle of Conquest for your faction? Which locations are most important? What tips, tricks and tactics have you discovered? What common mistakes have you witnessed?<br />
<br />

IMO its the best looking bow in the game followed closely by the Golden Bow from Twins. But yeah except for the few weeks before they changed stady shot to scale with ammo dps it was only good because it saved you on arrows and you didnt have to worry about reloading. I think it funny that so many more people have Dragonwrath and its only been available for a few months.</div></div><hr />

I think you're confusing &quot;luck&quot; with &quot;skill.&quot; Any person that cleared sunwell (or BT, for that matter) back in BC put in the exact same &quot;effort&quot; as the person that won thor'idal or the glaives... the latter people were just lucky enough to see it drop and subsequently win it. And as dungeon rolls have been teaching us since WoW existed, luck doesn't exactly follow with people that &quot;deserve&quot; something. <br />
<br />
If the ring off of Hagara was instead a 1% drop, or if the &quot;A legendary engagement&quot; quest were given via an item that had a 1% droprate off of the first firelands boss you kill, would it cut down the number of legendaries floating around? Yes. But would it ensure that only the most studious, cutting-edge progression raiders had it? No, it wouldn't. It would still boil down to nothing but luck.</div></div><hr />

It was only used if your Hunter didn't have the Golden Bow of Quel'thalas. It was largely a useless legendary as hardly anyone got it, it was a marginal upgrade from the Golden Bow, and after the 3.0 patch (2 months before Wrath) it became worse than the Golden Bow by roughly 75 DPS. At that point, that was a decent drop.</div></div><hr />

Yea this bow seems pretty generic to me..for a legendary at least. Bristleblitz Striker, Black Bow of the Betrayer, and Melmorta's Twilight Longbow all are better in my opinion. PLUS they are transmogable :)</div></div><hr />

Your 70 isnt included in the number in the chart, its only lvl 85 characters with the ach. More characters have it than the graph shows since some never leveled to 85.<br />

Bristle is nicely detailed and black bow is kind of blocky looking but they are all unique models. The best thing about Thoridal is it shoots magical arrows which look different from normal arrow animations. I would transmog to it just for that.</div></div><hr />

They say theses words because it's their fucking job to keep it subbed.Rogues are getting completly demolished, and I dont care how much damage they going to do, they are demolishing that class. Shuriken ? Great idea, so creative ? It was pretty much the only new ability of Burning crusade, Aka Deadly throw (which they are removing! it was baseline now its only a IF-you-get-it, thats called one step forward 2 backward), we remove deadly throw we give you shuriken, cheer up! The 75 talent line is complety useless, I mean no fun, no graphics, nothing, this is PASSIVE, forget it. So we are down with 5 talents instead of 6. That's some serious stuff to wet your pants. The 15 one being 20% speed in stealth, does that even count ? the 30 one, are basicly stuff we had ALL and now we have to choose. So same here one step forward 2 backwards. Same for 60, they take 2 abilities off, and we choose one (that WE HAD ALRDY).Do I need to draw a picture to tell you that your 90 rogue get raped by a 85 rogue at equal gear, stats ? It's like 85 rogues are using a golden dagger, and 90 rogues are going to use a wooden spoon ?Oh btw I forgot to say that they nerf base Ambush damage by about 20%, they remove Opportunity, Shadow Step and Improved Ambush. Wow I would even be surprised that this does more damage than sinister strike. Worse according to what we know so far, all 3 specs will hit the same with ambush, so this is no longer a sub flavor. To be fucking honest, is there any fucking flavor left to any of theses 3 specs ? ok so assass will probably stay poisons oriented, then what ? what is sub ? backstab ? that looks like sinister strike now except you have to hit from behind? is that a joke?Take your 85 rogue, remove all of your abilities and flavor, and you have your newly shiny packaged 90 rogues. 1337. Blizzard's brain is fuming for inputing that incredible work.So stop with your MoP &quot;TOUR&quot;, I don't give a damn. Seeing what they have done between Blizzcon, and now, &quot;shuriken&quot;. Right, I go chills, probably got hit by one.</div></div><hr />

Nah, the smart players started playing on vanilla, left somewhere in the middle of TBC to play other MMORPGS, missed WotlK and then came again just before Cataclysm. Because that's why I did and so it can be extrapolated to other people and used to judge them.</div></div><hr />

I guess you played the internal alpha and found out how rogues will play at 90. Oh wait...<br />
<br />
You have absolutely no idea how anything will be balanced at level 90 end game and it seems like you're just going down the line of awesome and flavored talents just saying &quot;SHIT, SHIT, SHIT, THIS IS SHIT&quot; because you're already determined to hate it.<br />
<br />
If you want to hate pandas, go right ahead, but don't try to disguise it as some sort of analysis of game mechanics it's 100% impossible to know anything about at this stage.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think it looks like rogues will get significantly greater variety and versatility, especially in pvp. But as opposed to you I realize that I know absolutely nothing about how it will actually play at 90.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm totally expecting an image of a boss on the level of a gigantic flaming skull constructed from rotting pandaren corpses who bleed orphan blood out if its eye sockets. :P<br />
<br />
I second that.<br />
<br />
The garbage we have seen and the the polar opposite blizzard has stated will come into clear vision with this press tour.<br />

I feel blizzard will do their best up-play the so called &quot;war&quot;.</div></div><hr />

They say theses words because it's their fucking job to keep it subbed.Rogues are getting completly demolished, and I dont care how much damage they going to do, they are demolishing that class. Shuriken ? Great idea, so creative ? It was pretty much the only new ability of Burning crusade, Aka Deadly throw (which they are removing! it was baseline now its only a IF-you-get-it, thats called one step forward 2 backward), we remove deadly throw we give you shuriken, cheer up! The 75 talent line is complety useless, I mean no fun, no graphics, nothing, this is PASSIVE, forget it. So we are down with 5 talents instead of 6. That's some serious stuff to wet your pants. The 15 one being 20% speed in stealth, does that even count ? the 30 one, are basicly stuff we had ALL and now we have to choose. So same here one step forward 2 backwards. Same for 60, they take 2 abilities off, and we choose one (that WE HAD ALRDY).Do I need to draw a picture to tell you that your 90 rogue get raped by a 85 rogue at equal gear, stats ? It's like 85 rogues are using a golden dagger, and 90 rogues are going to use a wooden spoon ?Oh btw I forgot to say that they nerf base Ambush damage by about 20%, they remove Opportunity, Shadow Step and Improved Ambush. Wow I would even be surprised that this does more damage than sinister strike. Worse according to what we know so far, all 3 specs will hit the same with ambush, so this is no longer a sub flavor. To be fucking honest, is there any fucking flavor left to any of theses 3 specs ? ok so assass will probably stay poisons oriented, then what ? what is sub ? backstab ? that looks like sinister strike now except you have to hit from behind? is that a joke?Take your 85 rogue, remove all of your abilities and flavor, and you have your newly shiny packaged 90 rogues. 1337. Blizzard's brain is fuming for inputing that incredible work.So stop with your MoP &quot;TOUR&quot;, I don't give a damn. Seeing what they have done between Blizzcon, and now, &quot;shuriken&quot;. Right, I go chills, probably got hit by one.<br />
wow this guy is mad as hell</div></div><hr />

I'd love have my smourne or other legendaries as mog but it's better that we can't.<br />
<br />
i bet they really wish they could make legendary's transmoggable...but because most of them are still able to be obtain, they probably won't ever. It really isn't fair for anyone who got the legendary back when it was new (even if it was just luck of the drop) because people can still go back and get them today. Even with the argument that well so and so only got it back then because it was a lucky drop...at least they were in a proper raid and the content was still somewhat challenging at the time. Now a days you can take 1 or 2, maybe a couple more 85s and annihilate the raids just to see a drop.</div></div><hr />

If people go back doing old, useless, dungeons/raids whatever, big deal. Seems blizzard found a way to recycle old content and keep people playing after all, without doing anything. I don't care about achievements, mounts, companions and fluff like that. But most of you do and the likes of you make blizzard happy. To me it's just another boring waste of time for things that won't matter when the game goes down the gutter or you switch to another. Right, whatever, cool story bro, gg.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mackeyser</div><div class="date">2012-03-05, 11:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I post this not because I'm one of those that enjoys putting my business onto the digital street as it were, but because I hope it gives some perspective. Us old folks like that perspective thing. Yeah... I'm old...LOL. Not as old as the study participants, but... grey..ing.... Not surprised at the NCSU study. I'm a service-connected disabled vet with a seizure disorder accompanied with chronic daily migraines and cluster headaches. Yeah, it's a grind. At one point just watching TV, my cognitive impairment had gotten so bad that I couldn't understand my wife (she sounded like Charlie Brown's Teacher) and I had a hard time remembering how to write. I started my recovery using puzzle books and have done enough sudoku to become part Japanese. But that wasn't enough. As the exhaustive neuropsych eval made clear, I needed stimulus. I had been a multimedia and network engineer. I'd built things others had never done and solved problems first. Going from that to watching daytime tv was quite literally killing my brain. A few things helped including a group of forum buddies I've had since 2000, but one thing that really accelerated that growth and got me back at least close to where I was... was WoW. I don't use opiates for my pain management and the task management, item management, lore cataloging, prioritization of my time and resources, SOCIALIZATION which as a housebound vet I don't have at all, and bunches of other benefits have made themselves manifest. WoW turned parts of my brain that had been turned off for quite some time. I'm to the point now where my wife may be able to go out and get a job rather than solely care for me, which considering my medical history is pretty amazing. Not saying it's all on WoW, by any stretch. I've had amazing doctors, faith and providence as well as worked unbelievably hard. People who don't live in chronic pain don't know what it means to do it without opiates. But WoW has definitely been a HUGE factor, I'd even go so far as to say one of the main factors in my improvement over the last 6 years. From the NCSU press release: “The people who needed it most – those who performed the worst on the initial testing – saw the most improvement,” says Dr. Jason Allaire, an associate professor of psychology at NC State and co-author of a paper on the study. Which coincides with my experience. When I was at my worst, the things that WoW helped was the things I most needed (and Diablo 2 before that, though as much as I initially thought WoW players were dupes for paying $15/mo for a video game, Diablo 2 just wasn't enough stimulus... and after trying it, I had to admit I was wrong about WoW). My focus and short term memory have VASTLY improved which is especially helpful as I have short term memory loss from my seizure disorder, so anything that helps improve that is important. For some, WoW is a game. For others, it's a hobby. For still others, it's a negative addiction and they need help. For me, it's therapeutic. I've found nothing else that has been able to keep my brain stimulated other than when I worked as an engineer and I can't work anymore. I know people make jokes about WoW and all that and I do, too. At the end of the day, for me anyway, WoW does real good for one person. (Note: I raid as an Ele shaman and have mainly since BC. Been banned on the official forums, even, for going at GC regarding Ele issues. So, I'm not a Blizz fan boy. I'm a pretty passionate player, though, and at the end of the day, I am thankful for WoW in ways that words will never fully express, even if they break Ele into a thousand pieces.../mumble...LOL)</div></div><hr />

Hm...when sin rogues topped damage at the beginning of icc, they were nerfed 3-4 times in less than 2 weeks. And that was also when it was implemented that all their stuns would share DR and they received nothing in return. They were a joke for the rest of that season, as were most melee. Rogues have gotten plenty of nerfs in cata as well. Improved recuperate used to heal for a lot more and they shortened the duration of smokebomb.<br />
