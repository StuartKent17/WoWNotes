Garrisons, Followers, and Outposts Ashran has been re-enabled as a potential daily strategic assault choice. This reverts a change from November 21 (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/16561637/#nov21). Garrison Buildings[Requires a realm restart.] Work orders for the following Horde buildings (Mine, Herb Garden, Goblin Workshop, War Mill, and Trading Post) and Alliance buildings (Dwarven Bunker, Gnomish Workshop, Trading Post) should now correctly contribute credit towards the achievements for Working Some Orders and Working More Orders. Gem Boutique: Followers assigned to the building should now always offer a daily quest. Gladiator's Sanctum: Highmaul Coliseum gladiator tournament should no longer incorrectly be awarding PvP gear and items that require reputation with Vol'jin's Spear or Wrynn's Vanguard to equip. Gladiator's Sanctum: Work orders were awarding much more gold and items than intended. The amount of items and gold awarded has been reduced to be more comparable to other buildings. Herb Garden: Visitors can no longer harvest the player's Frostweed. Salvage Yard: Awards for salvage have been split into 3 tiers based on the level of the Garrison Mission (Levels 90-94, Levels 95-99, and Level 100). Additionally, the mission needs to be successful for a chance to receive salvage with Level 100 missions having a guaranteed chance on success. Garrison InvasionsShadow Council Invasion: Concubine of Sin no longer awards points when defeated.<br />
<br />
Quests Shadowmoon ValleyThe Fate of Karabor: Yrel should now always assist the player with Krull. Additionally, Krull's Brutal Smash now has a reduced range of 6 yards. TaladorNot In Your House: Fort Wrynn Laborers should now always flee after defeating Ripgut. Send Them Running: Peons should now always flee after defeating Vicegnaw.<br />
<br />
Creatures and NPCs Grom'kar NPCs in the Frostfire Iron Siegeworks and Gorgrond Blackrock Foundry areas should now correctly have a chance to drop Iron Horde scraps for characters with a Dwarven Bunker / War Mill in their Garrisons. Shadowmoon ValleyShinri should no longer be getting stuck in evade mode.<br />
<br />
Dungeons, Raids, and Scenarios RaidsHighmaulTectus: Visual markers for Earthen Pillar, Fracture, Meteoric Earthspire, and Radiating Poison should now be easier to see. Tectus: Meteoric Earthspire now deals less damage on Normal and Heroic difficulties. Tectus' targeting circle for Crystalline Barrage should now still be visible for users with projected textures disabled. Twin Ogron's Fierce Disposition, Savage Disposition, and Aggressive Disposition should now be showing up in combat logs. Imperator Mar'gok's Arcane mines for Destructive Resonance should now be easier to see for users with projected textures disabled. Imperator Mar'gok: Visuals for Destructive Resonance should now be visible from anywhere in the Throne of the Imperator area. Imperator Mar'gok's Arcane Wrath ability should no longer incorrectly jump to a player that has been Branded during Phase 4 with the Power of Replication. DungeonsAuchindounDisabled the cutscene for Teron'gor that plays after defeating Azzakel on Challenge Mode. SkyreachRanjit should no longer occasionally target the tank with Lens Flare and Windwall.<br />
<br />
PvP AshranHonor and reputation increases for turning in Artifact Fragments first noted on December 3 (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/16561637/#dec3_ashran), are now out of testing and have been implemented. Disabled health regeneration for Kronus, Fangraal, Grand Marshal Tremblade, and High Warlord Volrath when they leash or drop out of combat. Creatures outside of Ashran should no longer incorrectly have a chance to drop Artifact Fragments.<br />
<br />
Battlegrounds and Arenas Rated Battlegrounds should no longer incorrectly be awarding PvP gear and items that require reputation with Vol'jin's Spear or Wrynn's Vanguard to equip.<br />
<br />
Professions ArcheologyPristine Ancestral Talisman and Pristine Cracked Ivory Idol should no longer be incorrectly awarded again if the character has already obtained the item.<br />
<br />
Items Follower Weapon and Armor enhancements can now stack up to 20. Temporary buffs that increase Critical Strike should now correctly increase Parry through Riposte for tanking specializations. Cracked Potion Vials should no longer drop for non-Alchemists. Everburning Candle was buffed much more than intended. The amount of mana granted has been reduced to 10,456 (down from 20,916). Additional information on the reasoning for this change can be found in the forum thread: Everburning Candle Changes (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/15538974728). Gently Squeezed Toad is no longer usable while in a Challenge Mode Dungeon.<br />

Everburning Candle Hotfix<br />
It look's like The Everburning Candle will be getting a nerf.<br />
<br />
The Everburning Candle will receive a hotfix today which will reduce the amount of mana restored on use from roughly 20,000 to roughly 10,000. Similar to the issue with Scabbard of Kyanos, our previous adjustment left the power level of the item drastically beyond the range of even Mythic raid trinkets. After this hotfix, the trinket will still be an ideal item for any healer, and we will not be adjusting the Intellect passive of the trinket which will remain at 334.<br />
<br />
With regard to developer comments made yesterday during the Final Boss podcast interview, we understand changing our minds about not adjusting this item may be frustrating. At the time, we absolutely meant that we were okay with it being over-budget in terms of what it provides (reference the unchanged Intellect). However, when designers took a closer look at the item this morning, they realized that the mana being granted was excessive to the point that it risked undermining healer and encounter balance, and creating a world where healers with the Everburning Candle would play a different game with respect to mana longevity than those without.<br />

For Rets it's an entirely different situation. It's their 2-set from PvP combined with Holy Avenger and Wings stacking that makes them powerful, not the damage output from abilities.</div></div><hr />

PC for frost is basically mandatory. Not sure what you're saying.<br />
<br />
Frostbolt does little damage. High burst to start a fight and then it's a complete free-fall to mid-pack. Most mages will tell you this change was absolutely necessary.</div></div><hr />

I am very sorry for all the guys that spent 250 k gold on this trinket in the last week, especially after a blizz guy stating they wont be nerfed, and within a day, they are nerfed. Doing this with items worth 200 k+ gold is just absurd.<br />
<br />
Wonder why them warlocks complain so much, they are pretty strong right now?. Edit: they didnt &quot;admit&quot; it was wrong to nerf rain of fire, they sait they were unhappy with it beeing without an announcement. Any warlock that has his senses together would agree, that using a ae spell for singletarget resource regeneration is stupid as hell. And Destro are actually doing fine without it.<br />
<br />
Mage buff was needed, ele/enha too. WW nerf was way to little, they could use a -10 % dps hit with the nerfbat to come even with other classes.<br />
Fury buff: so all those tanks can get their tank gear, and all the dps warrior can actually play dps warrie, and not some stupid shockadin shield spec.</div></div><hr />

Locks aren't asking to be top caster DPS. We are asking to be fixed. We have seen group finder for Challenge Modes asking for DPS, with the tag..&quot;No Locks&quot;. Asked a few of them &quot;why? Do you have a lock already?&quot; and was told &quot;No, their dps is to low&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Again, that was all covered in the video. They said if you need cleave damage there's Blade Fury for Combat. If you need quick poison spread there's Assassination. Currently it's at a point that they like. If they buff it too much it's like Garalon where you equip a blue mace and top meters with Blade Fury. Though they said internal data, logs, etc all show they are in a good spot. It's currently classes that are above and below that make things look out of proportion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally some good changes. Fury is going to be main dps spec for sure. And I'm going to keep playing the game because they didn't touch glad warriors thank god. Good updates. Just ret and druids need some toning down next...<br />
<br />
Out of curiosity what is there to adjust for Ret Paladins? The only thing that can be adjusted is our 2 Set for PvP, because with Wings and (I believe) Holy Avenger things can hit pretty hard. Our level 100 talents are bleh and only Final Verdict (converts Templar's Weapon Damage to pure holy damage) is worth taking which is what people will say hits &quot;too hard&quot;.<br />
<br />
It's easy to say &quot;so and so needs nerfed&quot; without giving any input as to why you think they need nerfed. Druids/Paladins had a little bit stronger healing needed and that was hit.</div></div><hr />

It's kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy, though. <br />
<br />
After they homogenized everything just before WOTLK, people started wondering &quot;why not just roll hybrids if all classes do same DPS?&quot;. At the time, Blizz said those 4 classes would remain relevant by doing 5% more DPS than hybrids. Then after WOTLK, that kind of went away. <br />
<br />
Nowadays, it's almost like they're saying &quot;we'll bother tuning 1 specfor PvE then kinda hope the other 2 are balanced. If we have time, we'll give you a separate PvP spec&quot;.<br />
<br />
I could care less for alts. I don't enjoy alts, I do enjoy playing the crap out of 1 character though, and explore each and every talent/spec that character has. That's how most RPGs are played.<br />
<br />
May as well give all non-Pala/Druid/Monk classes 2 specs instead of 3, then let Talents/Glyphs flesh the rest out. This might be a bit extreme but please Blizzard, quality of choice not quantity of choice.</div></div><hr />

I QQ because we are a class that ONLY deals damage. I play a Warlock to DEAL DAMAGE. Why are classes which have much more mobility, in terms of switching roles, higher than Warlocks when it comes to damage output? It doesn't make sense. At all. I would NOT be complaining if Warlocks were on par with other pure damage classes. Which is certainly NOT the case now. We are the lowest pure damage class, and not by a little, it's a lot. I'm not making this up, just look at the data from SimCraft and Warcraft logs (just look at a Patchwork fight like Butcher). I would provide the link, but I don't have enough posts.<br />
<br />
It is not a matter of opinion, it is a matter of fact. <br />

Because if your hybrid class's DPS spec is lacking, then you can easily switch to another spec. Pure damage classes don't have this option, our only option is to switch to main an alt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
(Check warcraftlogs, I cant post links)<br />
<br />
As you can see from the data mined so far, its clear and present which classes required a buff and which required a nerf. In my opinion the hunter is where DPS should be. (Nerf Druid/Pally/Monk, Buff those below)<br />
<br />
Druid's slipped through although there dominating the charts in both AoE and Single target fights.<br />
<br />
As a hunter I did some numbers, based of my last butcher fight my DPS was 22,720. Taking those numbers and removing 10% from Aimed and Killshot *although not perfect* leaves me at 21,557 dps. Totaling a 5.11% loss in damage.<br />
<br />
Not to mention this actually affects all spec's for a hunter and further decreases the significance of Survival/Beast Mastery.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, this nerf will create a new imbalance. (Mages likely to now sit at the 25k mark and hunters fall to where mages currently are... whats the point)</div></div><hr />

Thing is you dont role a spec to deal most damage, you role a spec becuse u LIKE IT, and it should be relevant. wich you actually are, you are just qqing for wrong reasons thats all i am saying.<br />
<br />
If all had your mentality, lets not have classes then.<br />
<br />
lets screw hybrids no HYBRIDS! less tanks, less ppl enjoy the game less healers, and you kinda know the answer what will happen.<br />
<br />
Play a spec/class you like, not to min/max it wich is an unhealthy and wrong way to look at it.<br />
Only if u try to get world first and got limitless time.<br />
<br />
and even there who cares? you got world first YAY! gz very hard try to win a tournament instead in csgo or dota. there you have skill and things to brag about, where skill actually matters more than this game.<br />
<br />
Ive played in hardcore guilds myself i was young once, i get it.<br />
<br />
But you will soon realise this is the wrong way to play these games.<br />

You play games to have fun, not to be #1 on the board but to have fun.</div></div><hr />

So most hybrids are in the same godamn seat as you.<br />

<br />
You really think a hybrid can just swap role and you raid will be happy with that? By talking about spec, you just shoot yourself in the foot. If a dps spec from a hybrid suck, he got between 1 to 0 other possibility to choose from. If Spriest or Ret Paladin are broken, every one that want to dps with those class can only reroll. Pure dps got 2 others spec to swap too. It's extremly rare that all 3 dps of a pure class are broken.<br />
<br />
Also, most hybrid most change their weapons or 8 non-armor piece to be able to do something in a different spec. SMF fury vs arm. Elemental vs Enchancement, Boomkin vs Cat. On the pure side, only the rogue got an issue with their weapons. The stats might not be optinal when you swap spec but with the removal of reforge and the &quot;better&quot; balancing of stats, this is less then a issue.<br />
<br />
So, most hybrid are stuck in a role from their raid setup and they have fewer spec to choose from. Who should have more solid spec now?</div></div><hr />

<br />
100% effective: Pure 3 spec DPS like Mage, Rogue, Warlock and Hunter do 100% damage in any of their specs.<br />
<br />
90% effective: 2 to one classes have their double role as 90% effective, so Priest heal at 90% effectiveness while Shamans, DKs and Warriors DPS at 90% effectiveness.<br />
<br />
80% effective: Classes with only one of each role in their class have each role only run at 80% effectiveness. So Monks, Paladins and Druids are only 80% effective in all their roles.<br />
<br />
<br />
By this logic, every raid's DPS should consist of only Hunter, Rogue, Warlock and Mages. This is because every other class in the game can do multiple roles, thus are suboptimal; especially triple role classes. Why on earth would I fill a DPS slot with something such as a shadow priest or feral druid which is only 80% effective at DPS (sorry shadow and feral, you were meant for PvE questing only).<br />
<br />
The only healer should ever be priest. It has two healing specs while all other healing classes have only one healing spec so why should they be as good at healing as a priest right?<br />
<br />
Tanks are unaffected since there are no classes with more than one tank spec available to them, but if one ever came out with more than one tank spec, it should clearly make all the other tank capable classes obsolete right?<br />

<br />
If you have three DPS specs and go to a raid and only one of them is the current FOTM doing competitive damage, yes, you are likely going to be forced to use that spec by your raid leader (like many warriors were likely feeling forced to be glad even if they enjoy the other specs more. Rogues were in the same boat too).<br />

If a three role class has only one DPS spec and that spec is currently under preforming, they have no other spec to fall back on if they want to continue DPSing so they will likely be forced to either change class or change role. If you ONLY like to DPS, three DPS role classes are a good choice since you have more fallback plans if one or two of your specs are not doing well at the current game balance (but I admit, mages were pooched in all three specs, some more than others until today's patch). I chose priest originally since I love healing above all else so if one of my healing specs ever sucks, I can just use the other (hopefully).<br />
<br />
Classes should be looked at as nothing more than a theme with each spec inside that class being treated as its own playable entity. That being said, in a perfect world ON AVERAGE every DPS SPEC (not class) in the game should be performing about the same (ditto for healing and tanking) regardless of class. I say 'on average' since some specs are clearly intended to perform better than others in specific circumstances (something classes with more than one spec in the same role can take advantage of).</div></div><hr />

Just because it isn't your form of fun, doesn't mean others feel the same. As someone who claims to be an older person, you should have already obtained that wisdom.<br />
<br />
You dont get what i meant i see, we all have diffrent things we find fun in games, some likes Roleplaying, some like pve, some like pvp etc etc.<br />
the issue and what i pointed out is that if you play the game to just be #1 in dps always due to a freaking PATCH! then you are playing wrong game.<br />
<br />
just as above ppl play for diffrent reasons, but how many plays for such a sick reason the game to be #1 on dps otherwise they rages? like really?<br />
<br />
And i never said either that locks never needed some tuning but they way you/he said it was like the class is broken, wich is not if some class is broken and abilities are flawed its my own but you dont see me qq? do you? i hope they fix it. But i gotta wait until 6.1 atleast we got the buff on our howling blast frost strike and obliterate, wich will not change much.<br />
<br />
But do you see me qq? nope im dealing with it. and playing the class for fun, acting like the guys, OH no flying quiting my account that attitude is so immature and not needed by anyone so quit then? some classes will get bumped down some upwards now and then.<br />
<br />
If you played like myself since vanilla you would know this is common.<br />
<br />
Vanilla was fury warriors topping the charts with rogues not far behind.<br />
tbc was Locks and rogues hunters.<br />
Wotlk was dk/retri locks and rogues</div></div><hr />

I think it is you who misunderstood me. I'm not saying that people who rage, qq, and whine over every little change should stick around. I simply pointed at the fact that for some, aiming for #1 on the charts is fun. So of course you will see some people providing feedback, when the class they play for fun and top the charts is nerfed and no longer allows them to remain competitive.<br />
<br />
I am in no way saying that classes should be #1 on all fights, all the time. However, people need to aim for that #1 dps spot, it sparks competition and improves the overall quality of players, through optimization and fine tuning. Which amplifies their reactions to nerfs, because it directly impacts their fun.<br />

Look. Someone has to be on the bottom of the charts. It might as well be the class that was on fucking top for two whole years, an entire expansion. Cry some more, locks.<br />
<br />
Let me start by saying I am not a lock so no bias here.<br />
<br />
Of course a spec needs to be bottome dps on some fights. But in no way should a spec always be bottom, and I am not claiming that warlocks are. But let's look at warlocks since you brought them up. A class that brings very little utility to a raid and only has their dps, should not be horrible at it. It is as simple as that. Destro is in an ok spot for ST, but their aoe is fucked atm. Demo and affliction need to be brought up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep, I can't work it out either. wowhead and the like list it as having its name changed from purification to restorative waves back in 6.0.2. I can only find purification in my spell book and the tooltip only mentions +5% mastery. wowhead also says you get it at level 10, but purification (the mastery one) says you get it at 90.<br />
<br />
We're on 6.0.3 now, so either the name wasn't changed and the tooltip is screwed, or its a hidden passive, or our toons are bugged :)</div></div><hr />

Doesn't take a genius to see where this will leave rogues now. Not to mention we've been pleading to the developers to take a serious look at our talents for a looooong time and we keep getting &quot;rogues are fine, they don't need anything else&quot; as a response.</div></div><hr />

Rofl, okay, now I've seen it all. People complaining about Fire Mages not getting buffed enough(a few raid tiers worth of Crit Chance if you look at it in rating, plus the crit perk), and yes, I've seen plenty saying the 10% nerfs on the 2 hunter abilities has now made them 'unplayable' and 'bottom of the pack'.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ater</div><div class="date">2014-12-09, 08:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because if your hybrid class's DPS spec is lacking, then you can easily switch to another spec. Pure damage classes don't have this option, our only option is to switch to main an alt.<br />
<br />
And in what way does it all of a sudden magically appear a spot for that spec in the raid team when the other go bad? If you play a feral (I don't play a feral) in your raid team and that spec is week, then you just can't go tank at take a tanking spot in the team, since your team already have the tanks that they need. You get put at the bench or have to reroll, the same way as a Warlock gets put on the bench or have to reroll if dps is low.<br />
<br />
And also If you choose to play feral you did it because you want to dps, not because you want to tank.<br />
<br />
Actually I would say that everything is the other way around compare to what you say. My first char in this game was my mage, it has not always been my main but when it's not I still have been raiding actively on it during most tiers. I prefer fire but most of the times when fire is weak another of the specs is ok, if arcane is stronger I play arcane and when frost is stronger I play frost.<br />
<br />
But what if I was playing a windwalker monk? (I'm not) if windwalker was bad I had no choice, I had to reroll another class or get benched. That's a lot worse situation then on my mage when I just have to change spec.<br />
<br />
Same with all the healers out there, if a resto shaman was very weak, it's not likely that he would just leave his healing spot and start dpsing as an enhancement, he would sit out or reroll resto druid, holy paladin, mistweaver....</div></div><hr />

If you spec combat/sub and optimize gear for those 2 specs and switch accordingly to fights you will do allright. Assa and combat single target dps might need a slight - SLIGHT dps increase.<br />

All simcrafts and logs have them sitting in the middle of the pack along with Rogues so I don't see a problem.

<br />
Monks should have been hit harder. I think blizzard thinks the nerf to rising sun kick is an actual 5% nerf to their damage(wich in itself is on the low side of what they need).<br />
<br />
Mages needs buffs<br />
<br />
Unholy DKs are strong, Frost DKs are weak. They buffed Frost DKs.<br />
<br />
Monk nerf was fine. Considering Rising Sun Kick debuff is pretty much 100% uptime, it actually is a straight 5% nerf to their overall damage. This nerf, combined with other class buffs, is actually a solid change.<br />
<br />
Arcane/Fire desperately needed buffs, which they both received. Frost Mages were actually strong, and well-represented on damage logs for every fight, so the buff is a little mysterious, but overall the changes were good (though Warlocks could've used a small buff)</div></div><hr />

Even after buff Frost DK is still 10% below Unholy for single target and even more for cleave/multitarget. It is not because Unholy is so good, it is on par with most other melee specs. So, this change doesnt change anything, frost still wont be played.</div></div><hr />

So deal with it, that there are always a few speccs that do better then the rest for an amount of time, so you either wait till they nerf that class or buff your class or you reroll to the op classes if you cant bear it to be middle of the pack. <br />
<br />
I repeat YOU WONT GET ALL BALANCED DAMAGE/HEAL/TANK Speccs<br />
<br />
<br />
You're right, if course, we all have a roll to play and some of those rolls are lower in dmg as compared to the rest. <br />
<br />
I cannot speak for anyone else and that said I will share that I'm personally not offended if my dmg is lower than someone else's provided I also have something else to offer. The problem with the current iteration is the theory blizzard has been force feeding us since wrath which was that they wanted raid leaders to take the player and not the class and by some measure related to that, the spec. <br />
<br />
Speaking as a raid leader though I will say that regardless of the player if my raid isn't making an enrage timer because all the players I want to take are taking dps classes that are VASTLY inferior than I've no choice but to replace them or attempt to force them to play something they didn't chose to play initially. For some people that's okay. Having to switch mains is not the end of the world. <br />
<br />
But at the end of the day I pay to play the class/spec *I* choose to play. Not what someone else dictates I should play and if buffs and nerfs in their cycle do not happen then we cannot continue to bring the player. <br />
<br />
My original statement of complaint isn't actually against blizzard so much as its against this ridiculous idea that one type of class (pure versus &quot;hybrid&quot;) has it worse than all the rest. <br />
<br />
They do not. I play a shadow priest. I no longer retain the ability to make myself valuable with mana returns and while I personally like the change to vamp embrace it's not what it was. My off heals take me out of shadow form and cost a fortune which would in turn force me to take mind bender 100% of the time if I had to rely on my secondary ability to heal heavily. <br />
<br />
As a hybrid I do not even have the off healing abilities of some of the other &quot;hybrid&quot; classes and indeed when we did...well I covered the nerf...and don't get me started on holding back halo(which again gimped our dmg) to time with burst dmg. <br />
<br />
These are not options. Not in the true sense. <br />
<br />
Yes classes seem to take a flavor of the expansion route and yes that should be ok. Provided, as I said, we have something valuable to offer outside our witty commentary, cookies and occasional niche use of side talents.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, hybrid classes cannot just switch specs. If I tell my raid my Elemental Shaman is switching to Resto because Elemental and Enhancement aren't competitive they will tell me &quot;That's nice. Good luck in your future endeavors. We don't need another healer right now.&quot; Tank specs are even worse in that regard. Roughly 60% of raid slots are DPS slots. 4 out of 11 classes are pure. Your suggestion is that 4 classes should be given preference in access to 60% of raid slots over the other 7 classes because those classes are locked into the 40% of the raid that is tanks and healers.<br />
<br />
As to what my Elemental Shaman brings that a Mages doesn't bring, 5% Haste. Mages bring 5% Crit and superior raid healing cooldown (mine have all be gutted), so if Mages always did more damage then what is the point of ever taking an Elemental or Enhancement Shaman? 5% Haste? No, you get that from a Resto Shaman or other class. What actually happens is Shaman become Resto or they get out and there aren't enough healer slots for them all to become Resto, so many just get out or, more likely, reroll to a pure. DKs and Warriors would be even more screwed as there are only two tank slots in a raid and they are competing for them with all DKs and Warriors as well as Druids, Monks and Paladins. If you say, well Druids, Monks and Paladins can heal so their tanking specs should be weaker than DKs and Warriors, you may as well remove their tanking specs as nobody will gimp their raid by using tank that makes the fight harder to win.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure, but I do know that at least the ability tooltips on my fury warrior (which will be getting quite a few buffs) haven't changed as of like 2 hours ago, when I logged in to kick all my garrison stuff off before heading to work.

<br />
Run some Sims/Monte Carlo type exercises and then adjust accordingly. I don't get why it needs to always feel so complicated.<br />
<br />
Also, if there is baseline variability, I would think that &quot;pure&quot; DPS specs should never be below average. I takes away the only role the class can play. Likewise, I just think all the classes should be balanced for the average player and that high skill levels could get a 15-25% bonus out of pure DPS specs and 10-20% out of &quot;hybrid&quot; specs.</div></div><hr />

Not yet but its somewhat of an indirect nerf. We have to see the simcrafts come out but this just means Fury (im assuming) will be back on top and if you want to be as efficient as possible in a raid the leaders will ask you to change specs so all that glad gear was for nothing. Wish it had never been as strong as it is cause now its just an awkward situation should the other specs catch up or pass Glad dps.</div></div><hr />

All simcrafts and logs have them sitting in the middle of the pack along with Rogues so I don't see a problem. Monks look like they will still be top at least at current gear levels so maybe they'll get touched on again, and first simcrafts would suggest that Mages perhaps got overbuffed when looking at higher iLvLs.<br />

No, but just because they said it, that's what they go by. Simcrafts only tell part of the story and aren't always accurate as much as everyone wants to think they are. There's so many factors that could be messing with them. Apparently their internal data is showing otherwise from raids? I figure the CP issue is because people are use to them resetting and/or not tracking buffs/debuffs. I don't know as I haven't touched my rogue since end of Cata. Either way that's what they said and why they haven't been buffed/nerfed.<br />
<br />

I agree in some ways, but then why bring any DPS classes at all then? Why not just have dual role hybrids dominate the game? Why bring a class that deals damage and damage alone when I can slot a caster that I can ask to heal, or find someone that can do both? Same for tanking. Raid utility is a thing there too. If a &quot;pure&quot; DPS class has very little raid utility beyond a buff bot, or a battle rez, what the hell does that do for raid groups?</div></div><hr />

Same for tanking.<br />
<br />
One of us must live in a strange parallel universe. <br />
<br />
In mine when a question like &quot;should we take that ret pally or that mage?&quot; comes up the answer &quot;we need magic ranged more than yet another melee dps, lets take the mage&quot; has about a zillion times higher chance of occurring than &quot;we might need another/new tank/healer, the ret pally might have a tank or heal offspec, might have the gear for it, might be skilled in it and might be willing to use it, lets take him&quot;.<br />
<br />
People choose a dps because they need a certain type of dps, the players item level, the utility the class brings in their current spec (and not other specs) and the current dps performance of their class &amp; spec. <br />
<br />
&quot;They could switch to tank/healer&quot; isn't something I have ever seen as reason. People desperate for a healer asking random dpsers with the theoretical capability if they want to join as tank/healer, sure, but then they are looking for a tank/healer. It is increasing a dpsers chance to join groups if they are willing to switch to that role, but it isn't increasing their chance to join groups as dps one bit.</div></div><hr />

Everyone saying &quot;hybrid&quot; classes can do everything are clearly trolling. I could start going into detail but it would be a waste of time trying to explain it to them if they simply ignore all the changes to &quot;hybrid classes&quot; in recent years.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hybrids can switch specs but we pure dps can't&quot; *whine* <br />
Because your class doesn't have 3 specs like any other class and because say Shadow Priests want to heal, thats why they play Shadow in the first place...<br />
<br />
I main a Druid, I want pures to do more dps.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmocfe2bab4c21</div><div class="date">2014-12-10, 12:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unholy DKs are strong, Frost DKs are weak. They buffed Frost DKs.<br />
<br />
Monk nerf was fine. Considering Rising Sun Kick debuff is pretty much 100% uptime, it actually is a straight 5% nerf to their overall damage. This nerf, combined with other class buffs, is actually a solid change.<br />
<br />
Arcane/Fire desperately needed buffs, which they both received. Frost Mages were actually strong, and well-represented on damage logs for every fight, so the buff is a little mysterious, but overall the changes were good (though Warlocks could've used a small buff)<br />
<br />
Unless you are really bad its definately up 100% of the time(Rising Sun Kick).<br />
<br />
But, what people who dont know much about monks wont know, is that the damage buff does not apply to all damage the monks do. Like for example their autoattacks. They arent affected by the rising sun kick debuff at all and they are a large part of the monks damage.<br />
<br />
So the buff is roughly 2,5-3% overall damage nerf instead of 5% overall. Monks are far ahead of others on some fights and personally i do think they will recieve more tuning. Especially since they also have some very nice unique things they bring to groups.<br />
<br />
Mages needed buffs, DK's didnt. Sure frost is worse then unholy, but unholy is really, really strong. Why not buff combat, Survival etc. aswell then.<br />
<br />
Rogues in general need at least 1 spec that competes in top 7, and after todays changes it doesnt. That is pretty ridiculus</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skrax</div><div class="date">2014-12-10, 04:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wish they would fix survival hunter. I have no idea how they perform in pvp as I only do pve stuff. But at the moment it's completey unplayable. I mean just check out world of logs, highest mm hunter is above 30k and highest survival is at 23.9 for butcher fight, and that is the top rankings in the world atm.. So as an average/good player i can't expect to do much. I refuse to play mm cause if that was the only solution to do dps as a hunter then they might aswell remove bm and surv from the spec tree</div></div><hr />
