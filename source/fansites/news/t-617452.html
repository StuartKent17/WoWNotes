If Blizzard supports this why:<br />
- do they claim to balance on 5on5 when all tournaments are 2on2 or 3on3 and the imbalances in these brackets are pretty big OH HAI DRUIDZ ROGUEZ <br />
- its possible to watch ongoing games during these tournaments yet not on live?<br />
- the teams get premade Equip and can choose their race/class at will<br />
<br />
Arenas destroyed real MMORPG PvP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-you use Z instead of S HAI SAHAQUIELZ<br />
<br />
Yes you are 1400 rated and its 100% cause of rogues and druids. We know. Now stfu and watch the stream.<br />

Arenas as e-sport have nothing to do with MMORPG PvP, that's why the tournaments are played on private realms, numbnut. Nobody forces you to play arenas either, they havent destroyed anything. You're just jealous cause in AV you feel like god smacking noobs in mid field, while in arena when actual skill counts, you get smacked.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panoramixe</div><div class="date">2008-10-04, 03:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The 5vs5 comment is old, from early tbc. Far before they realised 5vs5 tournaments are unlikely to happen.<br />
The classes that are used the most often in 3vs3 seem to be:<br />
druid<br />
rogue<br />
warlock<br />
mage<br />
warrior<br />
priest<br />
<br />
6 out of 9 classes that are used a lot, just means there are 3 classes that aren't balanced. Hunters are a bit on the edge, some comps use them very well but it's less cookiecutter.<br />
So you have shamans and paladins that needs buffs, we'll see how they do in wotlk.<br />
<br />
----------------------<br />
<br />
You compare 3-4 games going on at the same time with their own server to hundreds? Blizzard will likely enable it in the future, but without plenty of research it would be an insane strain on the servers.<br />
<br />
----------------------<br />
<br />
On test/beta realms we often get premades too, I don't see why you should get them on live realms though. The largest part of this game is pve, which includes levelling. I don't see tournament force people to level new characters though.<br />
<br />
You seem extremely frustrated with a game, take a break of it ...</div></div><hr />

Sorry to disapoint you my very mature yet angry PvPer, but I have no intention playing in the arenas. Want to use skill in a game? Play Starcraft or something other where RNG does not play that much of a part and factions are actually balanced.</div></div><hr />

Wow isnt perfect, if some1 disagree with arena its their right to do so. This game will allways have pvp problem and im pretty sure paladin and shaman will be allways last in utility for arena, its Blizzard way of making this game. <br />
Sure its fun to watch arena tournament here and there but its hardly to say that arena is where you can show skills, its all about whats your comp is, and who will die first, its just deathmatch fights, no big plaining no high creative strategy cause there isnt any bigger goal then smacking fast other team.<br />
Im pretty sure if i would love playing druid/rouge/warior/priest maybe i would be on other side and defend arena but i play paladin and shaman so im not.<br />
Anyway enjoy in this streaming cause its fun and very well done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So tell me why almost all top PVP gear is only available through arena. &quot;Not forced&quot; haha.<br />
<br />
So tell me why my class trees are constantly being retuned to avoid arena imbalance.<br />
<br />
So tell me why despite retuning, 3 classes never had their primary issues in 2v2 addressed, and 3 of them make up the majority above 2.2k. I guess that's &quot;Balanced&quot;, (-1)x3 + (0)x3 + (+1)x3 = 0 amirite?<br />
<br />
So tell me why, in an MMO's PVP, every class is pidgeonholed into virtually the same spec, and follows virtually the same gear route, with the only exception being Paladins (lol 2v2) or Shamans (lol 2v2) and *some* priests or hunters (lol 2v2).<br />
<br />
Glad I have NoScript on so I'm not automatically adding to the # of views, giving Blizzard the idea that people actually want this. I love the site, but shame on you for auto-playing it :(</div></div><hr />

it involves a bit more... pay to play onto the tournament realm, then from there you qualify for this tournament.</div></div><hr />

All you do is sign up to play in a tournament. It really has nothing to do with being professional or not. It is just open tournament. One that can let unknown players try their hand at taking on the best.</div></div><hr />

Playing arena in their stupid competition, means you are best player in the world ? hmm.. ok. <br />
From my point of view.. those players are there for comercial and marketing porpose only. So you watch them and think they are your gods and you play wow more, cause maybe 1 day, you think, you will be at least 50% of what they are and you can be &quot;almost gladiator&quot; maybe. <br />

I think its sick the way that there are soooo many people ini these forums and who play the game who complain 24/7 about wow PvP and Arenas even tho they don't like / enjoy it? I seriously don't get it because the only reason I ever complain about balance, arena and what not is because I care about it and would like to see it become easier to access and enjoy.<br />
<br />
I see no reason for all this e-nerd-rage coming from PvE players who keep saying / thinking that the arena is destroying the game. Blizzard have and not doupt will ensure that the PvE progress is always fun, interesting and 1 or 2 steps ahead of PvP. Why is it so hard for people to just leave us PvP folk to it?</div></div><hr />

Don't get me wrong. I'm not mad at all, they deserved it, 'nuff said. But then again, I saw no pallies, hunters nor shamans in the tournament. I did love to see an Enh or a Retri owning it up there.</div></div><hr />

I must admit, so would I.. I personally think that Gravitas Gaming could have taken ORZ had they played a paladin, warrior, shaman since it was clear to me that Hafu could have easily been gibbed in her PvE gear and the extra dispells, termor totem, freedom would have help prevent those imba peels from Rhaegyn the problem being is that in these comps you have a maxium of 4 people and the likely hood of being able to find pro players who can handle their main combo and nail an off spec combo for specifically counter is just too hard.<br />
<br />
And even tho it's not on mmo-champion I swear I saw Gotgame West playing a hunter VS ORZ in the last game of their series in the lower brackets?</div></div><hr />

And please stop overreacting about arena If you don't care for it, please stop fucking caring then <br />
I me myself like seeing these kind of events and so do a lot of other people, why should you decide what we get to see and what not?<br />
The same goes for arena itself, there are millions of people who care for it and millions of people who don't so don't try to say what millions of people should think just because you think the world is all about you.</div></div><hr />

I'm not a big fan of WoW PvP at all, but I actually find Warhammer to be a really fun game. Lots of cool ideas they implemented in the game, like public quests, and having more focused, race specific classes is something WoW should have had (instead of, for example, having shadow priests of all the races instead of just Forsaken as goes the lore). Of course, the big problems I have with it so far is really long queues for scenarios and dead RvR zones when nobody else is around. The few crafting professions that exist seem cumbersome as well.</div></div><hr />

Clearly a lot of people do care about it, otherwise there wouldn't be any tourneys. Get over yourself, you're not the center of the entire world.<br />

See the bolded and underlined part, frankly I don't care what you think. If there weren'tenough people interested in these kind of tourneys they wouldn't exist.<br />

Yeah you tell em! If you wanna sit in your season 2.. <br />
<br />
I find it funny that someone is giving a way money in a game with a notoriously broken PvP system. Warrior,Druid,Warlock? against a mage,warrior and priest? in this game Class&gt;skill. That won't change as long as blizzards idea of balancing classes is based around stuns and snares and roots and all that crap.</div></div><hr />

yeah i mean why would only arenas provide pvpers reall good pvp stuff ?<br />
that suppose that BGs are for lowbies/noobz/kidz/whatever while the &quot;true&quot; pvpers are the arenas ones ?<br />
crap. <br />
<br />
arena is all about 5 man max. Bgs are mass pvp. so it's really totally ununderstandable the way blizzard consider the BG mongers (and yes there are quite a few). what's the use to go in a BG with your S2/S1 stuff when you get rolled on by S3/S4 stuffed teams ?<br />
no need to be really skilled to win in those cases. stuff does it all. and that is def even crappier then class/team comp &gt;&gt;&gt; skillz in arenas.</div></div><hr />

If they could fix the damn AFKers I wouldn't mind if they made BG sets, with costs 30,000 for one piece! why? because i love BG's and it's fun to play them. BG's have always been bad but with the introduction of arena gear for honor it's made it feel more like a job then fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The old days of BG faction rewards that rivaled raid gear actually made them a part of the storyline; today BGs are nothing but a detached honor grind.</div></div><hr />
