Greetings!<br />
<br />
While the Midsummer Fire Festival event has begun, we wanted to take some time to explain that there are some currently known issues with the Festival, and to let the community know that we are working on resolving them.<br />
<br />
The first issue, and what seems to be the most prevalent reported issue, is regarding gaining Fire Blossoms from fire quests that were completed last year. This affects the Honor the Fires and Desecrate the Fires quests, as they appear to have not reset from last year. We understand the concerns many players have about being able to obtain enough blossoms for this year to buy what they wish, and we are actively working on the issue.<br />
<br />
Second, there have been many reports that the quest “Unusual Activity” has not reset from last year. This is being investigated by development.<br />
<br />
In addition, we have had many players report that Crown of the Fire Festival from last year is not granting achievement credit for King of the Fire Festival. This appears to be a result of the quest not having been completed while the achievement system was live (as last Midsummer was before the achievement system was implemented). If it were to grant retroactive achievement for King of the Fire Festival, it would have been granted upon launch of the achievement system.<br />
<br />
While we do apologize for any frustration, we want to actively assure the community that we are working on resolving these issues, and any others that may appear.<br />
<br />
We will update this information as it becomes available. The thread will continue on our Customer Service Forum here: http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=17899684390&amp;sid=1 (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=17899684390&amp;sid=1)<br />

Blue posts<br />
More 3.2 related blue posts, it wouldn't be surprising to see the PTR going live this week, stay tuned!<br />
3.2 Resilience Changes<br />
Resilience affecting heals<br />
We considered the idea that resilience acts like a debuff for heals, but we're not happy with what that might do to the game. You'd be in a situaiton where sometimes you might not want extra resilience since it lowers your healing. Resilience is already something of a trade-off since it often comes at the expense of other stats (though hopfully less after these changes).<br />
<br />
There is a possibility that if fights go on for too long that dps casters may run OOM more than they should. That is something we may have to adjust, but we don't think it's simple to math out what kind of buff casters should be given at the moment. Note that the intent is not to turn every Arena match into a 20 minute slog. The intent is to have fewer 30 second matches.<br />
<br />
I do see some people saying that healers were already in god mode and this will only buff them. Just realize that player perceptions or intentions are different. For one person, a healer in a 2 vs. 2 shouldn't be able to keep their partner up alone. For another, having a 1 healer, 4 dps team in a 5 should be perfectly viable. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17899681400-resilience-change.html))<br />
<br />
DoT Damage reduction<br />
Dots were (and currently are) lowered when they do normal damage and lowered when they crit. I don't think anyone is arguing that fact. What dot-classes often contended was that this design wasn't fair, while our position was that they were balanced around that design. It didn't make sense to us that dots that couldn't crit (say the player didn't take those talents) should be able to do more relative damage. If anything it made those talents a mixed blessing.<br />
<br />
What is changing is that we decided not to continue this design going forward since warlocks and shadow priests could stand to be buffed. If anything, you could say everyone got the warlock design, and perhaps that is a more sensible design in the first place. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17899681400-resilience-change.html))<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
Bring the player, not the class<br />
The design intent is very simple, though it gets lawyered a lot by players asking for buffs.<br />
<br />
We want to promote diversity and flexibility in the raid group.<br />
<br />
Here are examples of what we DON'T want:<br />
<br />
You have to have a shaman in every 5-player group within a raid.<br />
You have to have 1 Holy paladin, 1 Disc priest, 2 Holy priests, 2 Resto shamans, 2 Resto druids.<br />
You have 2 have 2 Holy paladins to heal the tanks.<br />
You have to have an Unholy DK for Ebon Plague.<br />
You have to have a warrior MT and a druid OT.<br />
Etc.<br />
<br />
We push niches for healers, to a small extent, so that players don't just say &quot;Well, druids are the best healers. Let's take 6 of them.&quot; We want you to get a couple of druid healers and then think that you are probably better off getting a few different kinds of healers to balance out your raid. We want you to be able to raid if your best Holy priest is sick that night by getting a paladin, shaman or druid instead.<br />
<br />
Some players like to claim the sky is falling after every set of patch notes, and to be fair, it's a pretty understandable reaction. But the fact is that the Ulduar raid groups have been more diverse than at any point in the history of WoW. Even the most competitive, cutting-edge guilds in the world don't all raid with the same mix of classes. From that perspective, the &quot;bring the player&quot; philosophy has been pretty succesful. This doesn't mean there are no balance problems (or even quality of life or fun issues) left to address. Let's just keep it in perspective. Not many guilds are running with 8 [fill in the blank of the preceived overpowered healer of the month, probably Resto druids currently], and nobody is going to start doing that in 3.2. <br />
<br />
I'm still having a hard time seeing why you can't substitute DPS classes into this statement and have it be any different... except you don't push niches for DPS, you do the opposite. Because you realized that &quot;niches&quot; were holding people back. <br />
First, there are more dps slots in the typical raid so even if you bring say 5 mages, you have plenty of room for everyone else. Second, if you stack too many of one particular class then you risk not having enough of the buffs and debuffs you need. Third, there are niches for dps classes too, but they are also not overly rigid niches. If you bring too much melee, you suffer on some fights. If you lack strong crowd control, your pulls may be a little messy.<br />
<br />
All I am saying is that the design is, more and less, working. Players are still concerned about being curbed, sometimes only when they are trying to look into the future or having bad memories of the past. But for most guilds out there, it isn't a problem. In most cases, bringing a more skilled player of any class will have a bigger net effect on your raiding success than bringing someone for their buff or narrow healing or damage niche, provided you have your bases covered.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, man did that soundbite stick. :) I don't think anything I could say at Blizzcon this year could have that kind of staying power. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/17900053896-bring-the-player-not-the-class-except-healers.html))<br />

Roar of Sacrifice changes in 3.2<br />
The Roar of Sacrifice change we are trying in 3.2 is to give hunters back a little of the utility they lost when we changed it to be hunter only. Relating the ability to crits is to make sure hunters don't use it to keep the MT alive. Before we made the change to its current, live version, this was happening, and we didn't want to have to start balancing around the assumption that hunters were RoS'ing the tank. This would have led to making sure other classes had a mandatory buff, and so on.<br />
<br />
The 3.2 change is intended to restor RoS to the PvP functionality it had before, which is something a lot of hunters said they liked since they could use it on team-members and not just themselves. The cooldown is something we could iterate on, though we needed to start fairly conservatively with it to avoid having to nerf it right away. We can't change the ability back to damage reduction for anyone or we'd be back with the same tanking problem as before. But this is intended to be a buff to utility not a nerf to the ability itself. Feel free to offer your feedback on the change in this thread.<br />
<br />
This thread has gotten into some other hunter topics as well. While, I have no problem with you discussing them, I am going to confine my comments to RoS for now. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17900023373-hunters-dont-go-through-with-the-ros-change.html))<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (3.1 Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=610) / 3.1 Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?paladin))<br />
Illumination nerf<br />
<br />
If it matters, we changed Illumination first to correspond with the Beacon of Light changes. Then when we agreed on changing resilience (and it was a very long discussion) we knew we would have to look at healing, or at least the healing by prominent Arena specs. Resto and Disc almost certainly needed attention. We thought paladins might be okay since their mana regen had already been nerfed and Beacon isn't a huge factor in PvP.<br />
<br />
I understand some paladins who don't like the change are trying to somehow trap us into admitting the Illumination nerf was for PvP. This strategy of questioning our motives always perplexes me, because we try to be up front about when we think something is too powerful -- we don't try to hide it. We would rather face player ire directly by stating something is getting nerfed because it was too good rather than try and sneak the nerfs in under questionable justification that smart players would see through anyway.<br />
<br />
Illumination was nerfed for PvE reasons. Having made that nerf convinced us we didn't need additional PvP changes (for now anyway). We always consider what effect changes will have on PvP and PvE (and 5-player dungeons, soloing and the level-up experience as well). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17899681400-resilience-change.html))<br />
<br />
[...] The nerf to Illumination was almost entirely because of the buff to Beacon of Light. Beacon can now provide massively more healing in some situations. If paladins still had the mana return they do currently, they would be the best healer in the game by a pretty wide margin. It is difficult to argue that point. Now you can argue that you prefer the current model (HL on the tank and nearly unlimited mana) better. But it's hard to argue the new Beacon would be balanced without other changes.<br />
<br />
I'm going to throw out some made-up numbers. These are not from actual stats, but are hopefully typical of say a 25-player, 10-min hard fight (something like XT). Feel free to disagree but they shouldn't be off by orders of magnitude.<br />
<br />
A Holy paladin's mana regen might look like this:<br />
<br />
Illumination 70,000<br />
Divine Plea 50,000<br />
Replenishment 36,000<br />
Other sources of mana 30,000<br />
Mana from gear 10,000<br />
Overhealing 60%<br />
<br />
A Holy priest's mana regen might look like this:<br />
<br />
Replenishment 30,000 (remember, the paladin has more mana)<br />
Other sources of mana 40,000<br />
Mana from gear 25,000<br />
Overhealng 30%<br />
<br />
See the problem? We're not talking about mana regen that is slightly off from other classes.<br />
<br />
This situation is acceptable (somewhat) in current content because you can only do so much with such high levels of regen since you generally have to target one heal at a time. We could pretty much just make paladin spells free and the outcome wouldn't change that much. That's an exaggeration, but you get the point: paladins are generally GCD limited much more than they are mana limited. I'm not sure anyone is that mana limited in current content (though slightly more so on the hard modes), but whatever it is, paladins feel it the least.<br />
<br />
Now we change Beacon so that the overhealing counts. Paladin healing is going to go up, probably by a lot. We can argue how much it's going to go up or how of that will be effective healing. But it will go up a lot, especially considering the glyph of HL will get more use. Considering how much higher paladin regen is than other healers, it has a long way to fall before it would even be at parity.<br />
<br />
Remember, we are also nerfing Penance, Prayer of Healing and Lifebloom. The latter won't be felt as much in PvE, but also realize we are talking about 3.2 changes here and the current druid set bonuses (which might be slightly overpowered) won't be around.

The nerf of divine intellect from 15% increase down to 10% increase.

Go take a look at some WWS reports instead of whining and supposing from the get go that he's just spouting nonsense. The numbers i find on mine are actually worse (in terms of paladins getting much more than others thanks to illumination) than those he gave.<br />

If you want to argue on spell cost difference or others, or the fact that you go OOM, fine. In this case however you are the one being stupid.</div></div><hr />

GC, you should go and (1) read George Orwell (2) Watch Tail Wag Dog (3) read something of Soviet Russia propaganda - that would teach you do deliver bullshit with a little bit more professionalism. <br />
<br />
The true story around is would be the following:<br />
1) We decided to nerf holy in PVP as our rogue friends think they are healing too good in arena. The best solution would be to nerf mana regen in many different way. <br />
2) We understood that the paladin community would be very unhappy about illumination (the key spec ability) double nerf, so based on our assumption that our player base is full of idiots, we decided to communicate this PVP nerf as a necessary addition to huge PVE buff (what a great idea).<br />
3) So we put the bullshit post, about our &quot;paladin class rework to make it better&quot; and communicated this bullshit. We says unusual amount of time how great healers paladins become thanks to Beacon of Light buff! (which is pure and complete lie and as such need to be repeated as many times as possible for people to believe). <br />
4) Unfortunately a) not all of paladins around are idiots b) some naive member of our team posted on absolutely different topic that &quot;we nerfed illumination to address burst healing problem&quot;. <br />
5) So, we got to trouble and GC was have to put this post, about how honest we are and even gather some numbers! <br />
6) So, now the accent of our communication is moving ( as with previous communication bullshit with Vindication). Illumination was massively overpowered! We were letting it be because paladin sucked and didn't have much to do with this mana. But now we nerf it because of the great BoL buff now holy paladins are so good, so good, bla bla<br />
<br />
Leave holy paladins alone, you liers, that would save a lot of effort on continuous lying.</div></div><hr />

Paladin healing is going to go up, probably by a lot. We can argue how much it's going to go up or how of that will be effective healing. But it will go up a lot, especially considering the glyph of HL will get more use. Considering how much higher paladin regen is than other healers, it has a long way to fall before it would even be at parity(Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/17899683428-a-misconception-that-must-be-cleared.html))<br />
<br />
Except that it won't really, exactly because of the mana regen nerfs that are going to be put into place.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying it isn't going to get used, and it'll certainly be more effective with the proposed changes to beacon, but it's highly unlikely we'll be in a position to spam it in a way that'll make it overly effective during a long fight.<br />
<br />

Now you can argue that you prefer the current model (HL on the tank and nearly unlimited mana) better. But it's hard to argue the new Beacon would be balanced without other changes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't call &quot;the current model&quot; what you perception of the current model is!<br />
<br />
&quot;The current model&quot; perfectly can be BoL MT and HL the raid after the massive AOE damage was done or some people got huge burst damage.* And the *current, unbuffed* BoL is just fine.* It's the model which can be used on Ignis (BoL MT, HL the person taken by Ignis),* on XT-002 (BoL MT, HL the person who has damaged by being bomb during tremor), on Kalagorn (BoL MT, HL the person gripped). <br />
<br />
Also, on encounters where 2 tanks got massive damage (like Patchwerk) BoL one spam heal another is the &quot;current model&quot;. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, there are encounters you created which *requires* holy pala to spam HL the MT. And while now we are still able to heal after the period of spam, after your so called buff we will be staying OOM and thinking about how powerfull our BoL is. <br />
<br />
If you wanted to nerf Illumination - fine, nobody but rogue could be safe from your arbitrary nerfing. But please, don't lie and don't call it &quot;buff&quot; let alone argument about &quot;current model&quot;,* or any other kind of models, you have no idea about.* You know, drop your precious rogue for a while, take holy paladin and heal couple of hard modes. Then come back and say something about &quot;models&quot; being aware about what are you talking about. <br />
<br />
Interesting, that the only 3.2 topic on elitist jerks paladin's forum is about protection, so people who knows the class hope this &quot;buff&quot; will never see life....</div></div><hr />

.25% less mana every 5 seconds isn't a buff ;)<br />

Replenishment: This buff now grants 1% of the target's maximum mana over 5 seconds instead of 0.25% per second. This applies to all 5 sources of Replenishment (Vampiric Touch, Judgements of the Wise, Hunting Party, Enduring Winter Frostbolts and Soul Leech).<br />

That will not help much, I am afraid. This nerf is changing what we are doing. Gathering mp5 in all slots and at all gems won't allow to keep it. We will see, how bad it's gonna be.<br />
<br />

That's answer your last question. I am not trying to offend you, but if you are saying that replenishment is buffed while in reality it was nerfed, I doubt you have enough information to judge about paladins. <br />
<br />

<br />
At the moment for most hard battles I am OOM right about the end of the battle, with LoH being used. Not sure why you put &quot;Hard mode&quot; in quotation - hard mode is official Blizzard's term.<br />
<br />
4) Yes, we will sure learn to adjust to this nerf, point is they call it buff<br />
a) But with the buff to BoL so the pally is better at raid healing is a buff no? <br />
<br />
No. For paladins, who did know how to use BoL for most effect not much will change.<br />
<br />
<br />
5) Priests have their advantages and disadvantages. Paladins used to have too, before 3.2. After 3.2 they will probably be out of the competetive raiding, while Blizzard are lying about them being &quot;the best healers&quot;.<br />

When I say competitive raiding I mean those guilds/groups which are trying to get first kills of the bosses or at least to have boss killed as soon as possible. Sure, at some level of raid gear this mana regen nerf won't matter. But on the edge paladins could found themself right below threshold and outta raid.<br />

<br />
<br />
Look, we&#8217;re not haggling over the price of a used car here. The designers make the changes we think are right for the game. If you disagree with the changes, you are welcome to provide feedback. Sometimes when players seem to have trouble understanding our design direction I might throw out some numbers of the kind of thing we are seeing. Players typically attack those numbers, which does almost nothing to further their cause, because those are the numbers we see and are balancing around. Those are the numbers we feel are correct. It is different when players come up with their own numbers because then you are campaigning for us to change something. The obligation is on your end to convince us to make a change. The obligation is not on our end to ask permission for us to change the numbers in the game (though we will ask for feedback). <br />
<br />
[...]<br />
<br />
We don&#8217;t have to justify our decisions at all, and often don&#8217;t. Given that, when we try to explain why we are making a particular change, it might behoove you to consider things from our point of view instead of always concluding &#8220;Their numbers are just wrong.&#8221; This is why we provide numbers so rarely &#8211; because the community as a whole stops looking at the broader design issue (which is of far more interest to us) and wants to quibble about whether the numbers are accurate. We aren&#8217;t looking for feedback on our numbers. We are looking for feedback based on the design changes we might make as a result of those numbers.<br />
<br />
In this case those problems included that many paladins where casting HL on the MT forever and doing almost nothing else. We wanted to make paladin healing a little more dynamic. We wanted you to change targets and consider who you were healing. To do this we think we needed to nerf mana regen to avoid paladins from becoming enormously more powerful. <br />
<br />
[...]<br />
<br />
When 99% of the paladin community says something, we will listen. When a few dozen forum posters who might not have a problem with paladins being the best healer in the game have an axe to grind then you have to understand if we take it with a grain of salt. <br />
<br />
[...]<br />
<br />
Again, it doesn&#8217;t really matter. It doesn&#8217;t change anything if you believe the numbers or not. They are reasonably accurate numbers. My point was that paladin regen was much higher than that of other healers, perhaps even double or triple. That works okay in a world when paladins can&#8217;t be counted on to heal more than one target at a time. The Beacon change lets you much more reliably (though of course not at 100%) heal two targets at a time.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The right answer, in all honesty, would be for all holy paladins to cancel they account right after 3.2 is alive and to put an appropriate comment. Then probably GC would find the connection between &quot;99% of paladin community&quot; and &quot;few dozen of forum poster&quot;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hypocratus</div><div class="date">2009-06-22, 11:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=17899683428&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=20&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, poster Kerenia:<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not sure if GC or many of the posters get the point still. While XT Hard is definitely a decently difficult test of healing, it's not the fight we're concerned about - we don't have to thread nonstop holy light in between the boss swing timers for the tanks to survive there, and the only nonstop HL usage really comes during tantrum.<br />
<br />
What we're really worried about is those hard-mode fights on the margins that require non-stop stop-casted holy lights for several minutes, like Iron Council Hard. In order to justify our raid spots we *need* to cast holy lights nonstop without breaks, and empirically we run out of mana in those situations unless we stop-cast at the risk of killing the tank.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would love to see a mechanic that would allow us to MT heal efficiently without stopcasting but unless either flash of light's scaling comes up to about 6-7K non-crit or we can stack and roll multiple FoL HOTs on the tank we will not have the throughput for an alternate strategy to be competitive. As a result, what we're worried about is that our current holy light spam situation on the tank just gets worse by 30% less illumination return and consequently more penalties for not stopcasting, with no alternatives available.<br />
<br />
A great example of our inability to compete on a throughput or efficiency standpoint without illumination is the current fairly horrible situation for paladins on hard mode Vezax - holy paladins are often left to melee the boss until the Saronite Animus shows up, at which point they blow all of their mana.<br />
<br />
While I understand that the beacon change requires an illumination nerf when considering the vast majority of bosses in Naxx and Ulduar, I believe what worries me and other paladins is that you've offered no reassurance that during the most difficult encounters in the game we will continue to have the longevity and throughput necessary to justify our position in raids. Bumping flash of light up to be competitive again or even better, allowing multiple SS's and stacking HOTs would go a long way in fixing that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Very resonable concerns explanation from the same thread... One that, I am pretty sure, won't be addressed by GCmoron, as it can't be in a &quot;we're not haggling over the price of a used car here&quot; style.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Come 3.2 though a lot of players are going to be focused predominantly on the new content, so what happens in those fights will feel a lot more relevant than Patchwerk or XT. <br />
[...]<br />
No, you will not be able to spam Holy Light for 5 minutes on one target without stopping. We don&#8217;t think that design is good for the game. We are willing to balance the new content around that change if need be. <br />
<br />
<br />
Here is our answer. (1) New content will be adjusted to new paladins, no heavy continuous damage on tank, which would require paladin to spam-HL.* <br />
(2) They don't care much about old content (3) If you want to finish hard mode on current content, better do it now. <br />
<br />
And the pattern is also visible - they make the change, then when they realize that something is wrong with the change, they don't accept they make mistake, no, they make another change to compensate the previous one.* Here's what I mean on other place when I said GC and gang are killing the game by increasing disbalance.* <br />
<br />
To say, we will design new bosses in the way that would hide our mistake with the premature change and we don't care about existing boses* - that's the way to go....* <br />
<br />
On the other hand, if new bosses are adjusted to new paladins, that's probably not as bad in the end of the day, as old hard modes will be probably doable just because of gear advantage from new content - as 10 man Sarth 3D is currently doable pretty easy - kill Sarth before second drake lands.</div></div><hr />

- most of the fights are designed for high dmg, that means we need to cast HL no stop since FoL wont keep anything alive at current content.<br />
- pally regen its too high, of course it should be high, HL should be the most mana expensive healing in all game.<br />
- pally regen its too high still, of course, they made all the pallies to go that way with relic, tier x4 pieces set bonnus, grypho of wis, all the crit from naxx gear and divine plea benefit from intellect really well.<br />
<br />
They praticaly made all pallies to HL spamm to be viable at PvE and now they are forcing us to change becouse ours regen its too high? BS.<br />
If i can recall all the nerfs we got for mana regen i ll try to list them:<br />
- divine plea debuff increased from 20% less healing to 50% while ticking;<br />
- BoW dont stack with mana totem anymore;<br />
- all the raid replenishment regen nerf;<br />
- Ulduar gear dont have crit or less crit than naxx gear (i dont want mp5 gear blizz);<br />
- SS only castable at 1 target per time;<br />
- Guardian nerfed to pally max health;<br />
- BoS nerfed to pally max health;<br />
<br />
I could keep going... but i guess those are more than enoff.<br />
<br />
Those are old nerfs, i dont even want to talk about ours next nerfs, they make me wander what should we do to compensate it and i dont have a answer for it yet.</div></div><hr />
