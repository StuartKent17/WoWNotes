Legends - Part one: The Gathering<br />
It's been a while since the last time we saw a huge machinima project (the last one was probably Tales of the Past). &quot;Legends&quot; is a machinima created by Lucas Cedergren, the first part is 1 hour long (split in 5 Youtube Videos) and is the result of months of work in cooperation with a lot of people from the machinima scene, see the description below for more information!<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;object width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;385&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/p/EAF93660DBDEC831?hl=en_US&amp;amp;fs=1&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowscriptaccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/p/EAF93660DBDEC831?hl=en_US&amp;amp;fs=1&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;385&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br />
<br />
Background<br />
After centuries of conflict the world of Azeroth has found, at long last, sense of peace and well being. New generations rise and new allegiances are forged in a brave and exciting new world with hope of an even brighter tomorrow - but in these times there are those who would seek to crush hope and extinguish the light. Minds dark and twisted, focused only on spreading the darkness that clings to their very being. Unaware of this rising darkness Azeroth continues, in blissful ignorance, to enjoy new-found freedoms, unknowingly walking towards their demise. But there are remnants of wars past. Heroes of old... Some would say... Legends. Brave warriors who selflessly sacrificed themselves to protect their people. But that was long ago, things have changed and the heroes of old have been scattered and forgotten, un-needed, until now. Maybe if they could be found in time.. Maybe the course of this dark destruction could be averted.<br />
<br />
All hope now rests on the shoulders of two young, fresh faced Warriors, as they rush to save Azeroth and reunite these heroes so that they can once more restore peace to the world.<br />
<br />
Quick Note From Lucas &quot;Lima&quot; Cedergren<br />
Most movies are made in Modelviewer. But this is recorded 90% in-game. We've had the help of some of the best voice actors in the machinima community, additional sound design by Glenn Xaydin Govan and special effects by Johan VÃ¥gstedt I think we have created something to be proud of. I very much hope that all of the viewers will enjoy it! This is the first part of three. We are currently writing the script for the second one and we are sure that it won't take 4 years to complete it this time. This movie is more of a prologue for the upcoming 2 that will contain a lot more action and delve deeper into the plot. If you want more information about the movie and our upcoming ones please visit www.cedergren-productions.com.<br />

Guild Leveling and Rewards - Blue Posts<br />
Dark Phoenix Mount Reward<br />
The guild rewards you guys are seeing in game are not hooked up yet. Guild rewards have 3 requirements that must be be met before you can use them. First and foremost, they must be unlocked via a guild achievement. Let's just say, that for example, you need to complete the new guild achievement &quot;We are Legendary&quot; in order to unlock the Dark Phoenix. That achievement requires the guild to gain access to all 6 legendary weapons currently available in the game. (note that all guild achievements start on Cataclysm launch, so anything you have now will not matter, it must be done with your guild after launch)<br />
<br />
So, let's say that your guild get's this achievement and thereby unlocks the Dark Phoenix on the guild vendor. At this point anyone in the guild can see the item on the vendor, but they will need a specific amount of guild faction to be able to purchase it. In this case, let's say exalted. Now, once you have the guild faction, you can purchase the item for its gold price. (prices will vary based on the reward)<br />
<br />
I am using the Dark Phoenix and the We are Legendary guild achievement as examples here but you should get the idea. Don't worry, we wont be handing out all the goodies so easily. =) <br />
<br />
Guild Heirlooms<br />
The heirlooms on the guild vendor are just like other heirlooms in the game except that these must be unlocked via a guild achievement and you must have the required guild faction to purchase them. After that, you can use them just like normal heirloom items.<br />
<br />
We did have thoughts of making these items guild bound a long time ago but we came to the conclusion that that was just too limiting of a design. Imagine leaving a guild and losing all the guild rewards that you worked so hard to get? Taking items away from players is something that we would like to avoid at all costs. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435506689/guild-vendor/))<br />
<br />
Guild Leveling<br />
Guild experience can be earned in any of four ways:<br />
<br />
1. Completing quests / daily quests that reward experience<br />
2. Killing any dungeon / raid boss with a guild group/raid<br />
3. Winning a rated battleground with a guild group/raid<br />
4. Earning a guild achievement (these are nice, fat chunks of experience so they feel great when you get em)<br />
<br />
A guild group/raid is 4/5, 8/10, 12/15 or 20/25 members of the group/raid being guild members. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435456436/guild-xp/))<br />
<br />
Guild Reputation<br />
Any quest that rewards experience to you will also reward guild experience. The amount of guild reputation earned is based on the amount of guild experience rewarded. Note that daily quests will also reward guild experience.<br />
<br />
All guild reputation is gained as a factor of guild experience. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435286221/guild-reputation/))<br />
<br />
[...] As I mentioned in the other post, anything that grants guild xp will also grant guild facton. So that means that winning a rated BG with your guild or completing specific guild achievments will reward faction as well as completing quests or killing instance bosses. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435286221/guild-reputation/))<br />
<br />
Guilds Q&amp;A (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435506685/the-questions-that-need-answers/))<br />
1.) No matter how hard you work at your own guild rep, even if you farm it like a psyco, can a GM just &quot;Deny&quot; you of the guild rep rewards. <br />
1. GM's have no control over the guild rewards. As long as your guild has unlocked the item via the achievement and you have the required guild rep, you can purchase the item.<br />
<br />
2.) Are all the standard guild control functions staying the same? (GBank control, inv and remove settings, ect) <br />
2. Yes, most all of the guild control functions are remaining the same. We are however introducing a new ui for guild ranks that will allow you much more control.<br />
<br />
3.) I understand there is going to be an exp cap per day, but as per reward and ability, will this at least be the determining factor that a 10 and 25 guild are not equals. (its an mmo ppl, go make friends) <br />
3. The experience cap is in place to help balance out the experience curve between large and small guilds. We tuned the cap to be be high enough that in most cases, you will never hit it. (when I say most, I mean average size guilds which make up the majority of wow's guilds) <br />
<br />
Guild Ranks system overhaul<br />
The entire guild rank system in the process of being overhauled. The new interface for this will be much better and allow you to actually move ranks up and down as well as copy an existing ranks permissions into a new one.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the inconvenience on this right now but it will be fixed up in an upcoming build. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435176567/guild-bank/))<br />
<br />
Guild UI<br />
A lot of the UI for the guild advancement system is in progress. The &quot;at war&quot; box will be removed from the guild faction at some point in the future. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435396308/at-war-with-guild-rep/))<br />

Beta Servers - Characters stuck in Moonglade<br />
We've investigated this issue and believe we've determined a fix to be released in the near future. I'm unable to say for sure in what build the fix will appear, or when that build will be released.<br />
<br />
I have a character stuck as well. :p (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435397940/moonglade-fix-eta/))<br />
<br />
Guild Leveling Speed<br />
We are looking for as much feedback as we can get on the guild advancement leveling speed and experience gain. Please use this thread to report any feedback you have. As much info as you can give on the size of the guild, active members and what you were doing to earn the guild experience would be extremely helpful.<br />
<br />
We know that not all of the ways to earn guild experience are active yet (rated bg's for example), but they will be soon. The feedback on how it feels with just quests / bosses now would still be useful.<br />
<br />
We will be tuning the values to get where we need to be until they feel right. Your input on this is greatly appreciated. =)<br />
<br />
Thanks! (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435397268/leveling-speed/))<br />

Hammer of the Righteous<br />
I think if Hammer of the Righteous went back to its old design of hitting 3 targets, you'd see the forums swarming with paladins in a few weeks demanding some way to AE, such as... removing the cooldown on Consecrate again. There is no way to change the Prot paladin rotation up without changing some core abilities, and we are committed to changing the Prot rotation up.<br />
<br />
We have some room to experiment with the proc rates for Grand Crusader, but remember that the more often it procs, the weaker it has to hit. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435176608/protection-paladin/))<br />

Elemental Changes<br />
In the next beta build (or the one after that), you will see two important changes to Elemental shaman. First, you will use Lightning Shield (for damage!) instead of Water Shield. Second, you will want to use Earthquake for AE over Fire Nova. These changes, especially the former, will provide Elemental shaman with a bit of an upgrade in the rotation over what you're used to in LK.<br />
<br />
I don't want to oversell it, because players have a tendency to imagine herds of glittering ponies when left to their own imaginations, but it should be a fun change. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435458370/how-to-make-improved-shield-wanted-by-ele/))</div></div><hr />

I really hope they change this. Not that I mind going back and doing the old instances, it's just my guild already has 1 thunderfury (at least), 1 shadowmourne (almost got our second), a sulfuras and Val'anyr. <br />
<br />
Seems kinda lame we have to get another one of each.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Looks like the way to go.<br />
<br />
You get your FOS for equipping the item. So you can make Sulfuras and Thunderfury before cataclysm, then equip them after launch.<br />
This seems awfully convoluted.<br />
<br />
I don't see why any legendary your guild already has couldn't count towards the achievement.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok guys we have 3 thunderfuries, 2 sulfuras' 4 Shadowmournes, 2 Val'anyrs, 2 sets of War Glavies (that's 2 sets of 2), 1 sunwell bow. But not a single one counts for the guild achievement. Fuck, guess what we are doing when we aren't raiding new content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They say they didn't want to give things away easily, I cannot even imagine why you complain about this.<br />
WotLK have been so insanly faceroll and that is making me sick.<br />
I LOVE that you have to farm for this again, finally you have to WORK for items and mounts instead of just getting them for free 2 days after Launch, because that's pretty much what you want.<br />
Anyone who disagrees with me should be ashamed if they concider themselves hardcore players.<br />
I'm saying this because I do not want WotLK all over again, as soon as naxx was over.. no1 raided it.<br />
As soon as Ulduar was over, only like 5% continued raiding it, then with ToC it was just farm for anyone who was newly dinged to get easy epics and achivements so they could later on progress into ICC with total lack of knowledge of any previous content.</div></div><hr />

Lol, it probably won't be too hard to farm that content at 85... Ulduar isn't even hard anymore and Icecrown isn't really either, LK is puggable with this 30% buff (on some servers).</div></div><hr />

And obviously, this^.<br />
It wont be that hard anymore, just require some farm and WORK.<br />
This is what I miss! I hope they don't screw this up and just gives the mount to any guild that alraedy has the legendarys.<br />
That would be insanly stupid and ignorant of they way that their game once was and should be once again.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Also, I do like that they finally give elemental a real shield to use (=<br />
Also probably improving earthquake, nice one.</div></div><hr />

The voice acting was lousy, the volume of the voices were poor, the story is boring and pretty dumb, the captions look like they weren't spell checked at all, and it all feels rushed. They could have done much better than this.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Btw, it doesn't make any sense at all for the horde to just pick up and follow Gul'dan with no reason. It makes even less sense that Thrall, Craine, Lor'themar, Sylvanas, and Vol'jin don't do anything about it at all. &quot;Follow me and I'll give you freedom.&quot;?

Yeah I know, but I'm standing with what I said.<br />
Farming the legendarys again should be obligatory for completing the achivement.<br />
Wether it gives you a mount or a tabard or even a banner that gives you &quot;10% lolz&quot;.<br />
Get it?<br />
If however the mount should be easier or harder, I don't care.<br />
My point is made to the legendary achivement itself, even tho I may have mentioned the mount.</div></div><hr />

Personally, I hope We are legendary is requirement of getting the mount. I just feel any legendaries your guild currently has, should count towards the We are legendary achievement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then everyone will have the mount the first day.<br />
Seriously, you are one of those people that just come online, facerolls them game through &amp; gets free items.<br />
Why? Because that is what WotLK is all about, there is also NO WAY that you played Vanilla or even TBC.<br />
<br />
Concidering those times were 100x better than whole WotLK, sure may have been balance issues in PvP.<br />
Buhu, atleast the PvE was AWESOME and HARD. The PvP balance and the 10/25man normal/HC destroyed raiding SOO MUCH.<br />
I can't wait until the endles farming days again, actually PLAYING the game.<br />
No more watching a movie while spamming 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1.<br />
<br />
Oh god I miss the old days, I miss hard content.. I hate all new people that complain if something takes more than 2 minute to do.<br />
And people leaving after 1 wipe in PuGs because they can obviously not handle the repair bills when they buy endless amount of golds online. Also, having no more time? That's a lousy excuse, why'd you even join in the first place then?<br />
Seriously, I can go on and on and on about how easy this game has become and how stupid people are.<br />
<br />
That is why I wan't the harder content back, and the harder achivements.. then all the ignorant fools will finally go away or just stick to casual or heroic farming.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Story<br />
<br />
The story is pretty solid. I giggled a bit when you mentioned Nihilum attempting to bring Gul'dan back. The only thing I wasn't fond of was how they always referred to the Heroes as they, or them, which starts to make them sound like Mary Sues. Also, the ending did seem a little out of the blue.<br />
<br />
<br />
Voice acting <br />
<br />
Very good. None of the voices seemed out of line for their character. Although the person who played the paladin didn't have the best quality of microphone, it was still good. However! I think we can all agree Jesse should have voiced the Gnome, since he can do that sick high pitched Gnome-y voice.<br />
<br />
<br />
Video<br />
<br />
Not as exciting or action packed, but you did say most of the action will be in part 2, so it's understandable. Also, I'm not sure if it's more trouble filming using the model viewer or in-game, but the model viewer scenes were much better.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall, I'd say it was good, can't wait to watch part 2!</div></div><hr />

This however, is NOT well tought through, NOT well directed, not horribly, but bad voice acting.<br />
They should also have had more plea on the players they were using in the movie.<br />
In the beginning Gul'dans army hated both the alliance and the horde, yet only attacked the alliance, which means their resources were also lacking greatly. The horde just stood and watched.<br />
<br />
Anyone comparing Tales of the Past with this and saying &quot;They are alike&quot;, &quot;Could be as big as&quot;, &quot;Almost better than&quot;.. well.. the words I will not even express, just imagine what I would have said. :&gt;<br />

Yeah, but we've have all seen how easy reputation farming is, don't be stupid now.<br />
Also, someone mentioned guild-hopping just to give guilds the achivement.. which they would earn insane cash on.<br />
So no, just no. If you really enjoy farming for stuff, you shouldn't mind AT ALL.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure how I feel about &quot;We Are Legendary&quot;. I like the idea of it, but the supposed execution is... hrm. They're absolutely right that most people won't get it done, because I imagine they'll just ignore it. I don't have any real problem with needing to go back and do all of that stuff again, but I can understand why someone might not want to bother considering there's an entire expansion filled with new content to dig through. For those that don't mind, though, it's there to dig your claws into. Not every aspect of the game is going to be appealing to everyone.<br />
<br />
The movie was embarrassing. Moving on.<br />
<br />
Jesse's dwarf voice is awesome and hilarious. Seriously, that's going to be the best quest in the game. It's available at a fairly low level, too. I was hoping that Blizzard would use their revision of the old world to build on the more game-defining stuff that they introduced with Wrath and so far they haven't really let me down there. The entire Worgen and Goblin starting zones, the new Troll areas, the early quests in Stonetalon and Azshara, and now this. There's a lot more, too. Blizzard has come a long way since the old design and put a lot of polish on everything from the old, wonky quest content with shitty item rewards to the boring, EverQuest-lite raiding scene. I may not think that everything in the higher tier is excellent, but I think most of the current end-game content beats the hell out of what I suffered through in vanilla.<br />
<br />
Curious as to what they're doing with Elemental during the next push. I've been thinking of swapping specs from Enhancement, but I've put so much time into building my gear that I'm hesitant to change.</div></div><hr />

But on the other hand, I'm a tad sad that a small part of the community probably will suffer som losses from the system. Playing on an RP realm, our raids are mostly performed by raid groups, since guilds are usually used for RP specific reasons. Heck, my 10man group alone are like 5-7 different guilds, even one-man guilds just for the sake of RP.<br />
Now we have to consider abandoning all that to be a single guild, so we can enjoy the rewards from guild experience and working together like we always do.<br />

WotLK have been so insanly faceroll and that is making me sick.<br />
I LOVE that you have to farm for this again, finally you have to WORK for items and mounts instead of just getting them for free 2 days after Launch, because that's pretty much what you want.<br />
Anyone who disagrees with me should be ashamed if they concider themselves hardcore players.<br />
I'm saying this because I do not want WotLK all over again, as soon as naxx was over.. no1 raided it.<br />
As soon as Ulduar was over, only like 5% continued raiding it, then with ToC it was just farm for anyone who was newly dinged to get easy epics and achivements so they could later on progress into ICC with total lack of knowledge of any previous content.<br />

About the machinima: I tried to watch the whole thing, I really did.... but I had to stop at part 2. Sorry but the story is boring, the script is terribly written, and the voice acting... well... you know. Good effort though.<br />
<br />
About guild leveling: I'm loving it! This will certainly bring more unity and fun to the guilds. <br />
<br />
A guild group/raid is 4/5, 8/10, 12/15 or 20/25 members of the group/raid being guild members.<br />
That sounds quite reasonable, although I was expecting the amount of guild experience gained to be proportional to the number of guildies in the group. So even having only 2/5 guildies in a HC would give you some guild exp, even if very little.</div></div><hr />

Did you even read what I was commenting on? Or did you just quote me on accident instead of the poster I was commenting on...<br />
<br />
Ok,<br />
<br />
So, tell me how, since you have to act as a guild if you want a legendary item count, you could ever see a guild hiring players JUST for the legendary items they ALREADY have (that anyway will NOT count for the achievement) ?<br />
<br />
edit : I think you missed my point, I wasn't reacting over the fact that this specific achievement should or souldn't be necessary, but over the fact that anyway this &quot;abuse&quot; can't happen if you have to get the legendaries required as a guild.<br />
<br />
Well, anyway.</div></div><hr />

His point was that people are whining about legendarys already owned SHOULD count towards achivement.<br />
Therefore he made an EXAMPLE of the downsides, get it now? He never said that was the case.<br />
He just stated it would be BAD.<br />

It's a dumb talk, I was exactly talking about his &quot;downside example&quot; which is wrong anyway.<br />
This implies side-effects on his statement toward the achievement obtaining process. So what's wrong ?<br />

He knows it's wrong, that's why he made the example.<br />
It was an example of why they should NOT make the achivement obtainable with already owned legendary items.<br />
So it was not wrong, cuz it was never true, nor did he imply that it ever would become true.<br />
It was JUST an example, if anything.. you should'v wrote that message to one of the 10 others that actually wanned it to be that way. Please just read the post again, word for word:P<br />
<br />
And yeh, this conversation should stop. Never a good forum with people disliking eachother. (=<br />
<br />
EDIT: This is what he wrote.. &quot;There is one reason that will never happen.... ABUSE. Imagine the following in trade chat &quot; X guild WTB players with the following legendaries......, paying 100k per&quot; Yeah...not gonna happen. Players with legendaries could guild hop and make a fortune.&quot;<br />
As you can see, he clearly said this to everyone that wants already owned legendarys to count towards achivement, which would mean guild hopping for money is possible.. just to explain to people that want it that way, that it really CANNOT be that way. :D<br />
<br />
I think we should understand eachother now :3<br />

I do hope the Dark Phoenix requires some work to get, but the key word there is &quot;some&quot;. An achievement like We Are Legendary is a bit extreme and I certainly hope that it remains an example and nothing more. I see no reason to not have a mount like that available to the majority (notice I said majority, not all).<br />
<br />
It shouldn't even be availible to even half the players, barley to a minority.. IMO.<br />
Hard farming should pay greatly, extreme farming should pay legendary.<br />
Not saying specificly that the mount is indeed the reward for farming the legendarys.<br />
It might aswell be the reward for guild repairing with 1,000,000 gold through guild bank.<br />
Or even just reaching level 20 with your guild, however.. the achivement &quot;We are Legendary&quot; itself, is not really that extreme.<br />
Most mats are easily farmed with a little help and luck, it just takes time! Like old times.. :)</div></div><hr />

Which is wrong is not the way to obtain the achievement, but the example he chose.<br />
<br />
In short : I reacted when I saw his example, I don't care wether he wants or doesn't want this achievement to work that way, all I said was that there couldn't be any &quot;abuse&quot; BECAUSE the way guild progression/achievement apparently work already prevents the &quot;Hey LFM owning [legendary X], 100k gold reward&quot;.<br />
<br />
Just like those who are still reacting like :<br />
&quot;OMG that's DUMB if your gm wants it, he can abuse ppl in his guild ! If he kicks them they're gonna lose the mount !&quot;<br />
while blizzard stated they didn't want rewards to go away if someone leaves/get kicked from a guild.<br />

I did too hope that the machinima would be better.. especially when they mentioned Tales of the Past.<br />
But I guess nothing will ever beat Tales of the Past, maybe not even Blizzards upcoming movie..<br />
Tho, I kinda expect that one to be epic. :&gt; Keeping my hopes up, for once..<br />

And that's the entire first part.<br />
<br />
Yeah it compeltely fell apart for me there too. I didn't watch more then the first part.<br />
<br />
All these &quot;great&quot; machinimas have such nonsense storylines and from an RP point of view, are often bland or very &quot;lorelol&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
What I'd like to see a machinima do is center it's story around something more normal. Not about armies and evil and impending doom, but about people and their lives in Azeroth, something that makes sense in the world and something that doesn't destroy lore by being too pompous.<br />

It's good to see that the devs are really on the ball. The shaman elemental changes sound very promising. Finaly a shield for elementals.<br />
<br />
Though it would seem that Fire Nova is gonna get useless for Elemental. Which makes me wonder why we get a talent to reduce the CD on it and increase its damage.<br />
Could someone explain that?</div></div><hr />

Blizzards idea to tell people wo really put much time and effort in legendarys to fuck themselfs and give nice mounts only to guys who faceroll through old raidcontent to get some random drop is just stupid. My opinion.</div></div><hr />

Lemme get this straight: This means you'll have to farm MC/Ulduar/BT etc again to get this guild achievement? Hmm... interesting.<br />
<br />
All i can say about that is WOOT for me. I've been 1 binding away for a while so maybe I'll finally be able to get some people to help me gain the other. Though thinking about it...getting another Valanyr may suck nuts.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zaerix</div><div class="date">2010-08-18, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the main problem people have with the legendaries you already have not counting is because you could spend literally years farming for the parts for vanilla legendaries and never see either of the Bindings or the Eye. I remember farming Baron Geddon and Garr every reset for about 4 months and never seeing either of the bindings. I saw the entirety of the rest of their loot tables, but never the bindings. Everything else required for Thunderfury and Sulfuras would be incredibly easy to get because they're almost 100% sure things (Except for the Sulfuron Ingots but you'll probably get 8 just trying to get the Eye), but the drops required in the beginning take such a massive amount of time to get, that's the main obstacle. <br />
<br />
That said, every other legendary has a much higher drop rate and could easily be gotten by a decent group. You could probably get everything else in the time it takes for you to get one binding.<br />
<br />
They could always increase the drop rate on these things, but that poses its own problems when you talk to the people that would go &quot;NOOOOO ITS LESS LEGENDARY NOW THAT IT TAKES 6 MONTHS TO GET COMPARED TO 2 YEARS!!!!&quot;. While true to a degree, I think they will do something to make these easier to get. Compare the time and difficulty required to get the old and new legendaries and you'll see the old ones required more time to start but everything was easier while the new ones required less time to start but overall were harder.<br />
<br />
I'll use Thunderfury and Shadowmourne as examples. For Thunderfury, once you managed to get the bindings to drop, all you had to do was go raid BWL (Which was probably on farm) to get enough ore to make the Elementium Bars and go kill Ragnaros (Who was also probably on farm). Then summon and kill Prince Thunderaan (Who was reportedly a disappointingly easy boss back in the day) and all you have to do is turn in 2 more quests and you have Thunderfury.<br />
<br />
For Shadowmourne, you first had to do a raid quest to get Light's Vengeance, do various things to get 25 Primordial Saronite (Whether buy them or have them drop), and then do Festergut and Rotface on 25 man. This gets you Shadow's Edge, which you must use to kill 1000 Scourge in Icecrown Citadel. Then you have to go do special things during the Sindragosa, Putricide, and Blood Queen Lana'thel fights and finish them without dying. Lastly, you have to get 50 Shadowfrost Shards, which have a 25-50% from 25 man normal bosses and a 50-99% from 25 man Heroic bosses.<br />
<br />
Overall, the second sounds harder. But the first takes longer because of the damned bindings.</div></div><hr />

what does a guild today when someone farms thunderfury? right, nothing. and with cata? right, nothing. i will still be able to farm it alone, but i have to be in the guild to get credit for it. so whats the point in not retroactively giving credit for it? the only time when a guild really was necessary to get the legendaries in mc was in classic. and exactly these guilds should be &quot;punished&quot; for it?<br />
<br />
how will it be with direct drops like the glaives and thoridal? is it required to loot them in a guild run with 20 people? that would be retarded. half of the people will be bored to death when clearing bt on 85 just to get the glaives in a &quot;guild run&quot;.</div></div><hr />

The old 'glory days' of Vanilla are gone, hopefully forever. Gone are the days that only a tiny percentage of the players got to experience end game content, gone are the days of Korean style grind fests -- or mostly anyway, there's still some stuff that has retarded drop rates. RNG = Rotten Number Generator, there's little Random about it sometimes. :) Or perhaps RNG = Really? Nope. G'day. :)<br />
<br />
The problem is that there's two VERY extreme views - the old school hard cores that want everything to take months and months and the faceroll twits that want everything yesterday and without any effort needed.<br />
<br />
I wish there was something in between, hopefully that will be what they end up with. <br />
<br />
I get bored endlessly grinding, but I don't mind a reasonable amount of grind -- a perfect example is the Venomhide Ravasaur -- it takes 20 days of somewhat varied effort that leads to a nice in game reward. The best part of the Venomhide quest is that you can actually see the little fella grow as you go, which is way cool. The Winterspring Frostsaber quest was not nearly as rewarding, or interesting being a simple rep grind that I was able to burn through in three days of hellish tedium.</div></div><hr />

The mish-mash of mounts, armors, tabards, weapons etc. .... meh. <br />
Given how many more or less famous machinima people and voice actors seem to have worked on this I would have expected more.<br />
Malkuth ie. had good voice-acting, really, but the sound-quality sucked.<br />
Also - please check and spell-check the subtitles, countless errors there.<br />
<br />
Another thing, may just be personal preference - but imo they should have a) used less of the ... &quot;fantastic&quot; armor, ie. Malkuth's shoulders and stuck to more... normal pieces and b) not used weapon enchants etc.<br />
If those .... *cough* .... &quot;Legends&quot; have this awesome gear... ok, fine. But every damn one in this &quot;Horde&quot;...?<br />
<br />
Also, the voices and voice acting should suit the characters. The two night elf heroes' voices and way of talking just didn't fit imo. But they didn't have &quot;fantastic&quot; gear, they had no shoulders, a regular sword - I liked them far better than those epic equipped characters.<br />
<br />
When those &quot;Legends&quot; finally came to Stormwind their epic gear, their imposing presence would have had far more of an impact if we hadn't seen squads of goons wearing even more imposing gear before.<br />
<br />
The Nine Inch Nails song could have been used better in action scene imo.<br />
<br />
<br />
.... also.... &quot;enslaved Kazzak AND fought a Horde army at the same time&quot;....? Paladin/Warrior Commander of the Alliance? A ten year old Master Assassin of the Alliance?! How about being *a little bit* more humble? For Frak's Sake...<br />
<br />
I'm surprised none of them is Arthas never-heard-of-before long-lost brother, Turalyon's sister etc.<br />
<br />
Or maybe one of them is, this Malkuth's seems to have some ooooh epic/secret/bad bloodline or whatever.<br />
<br />
Imo there's a reason that other machinima are being made in other programs to a large part, ModelViewer, Vegas etc. - it works better. <br />
Being 90% ingame is not a badge of quality imo. I know it takes more effort to organize things this way and I appreciate this but ie. Blind was not made 90% ingame but it was fucking amazing. Same for Boom de Yada. <br />
<br />
One time it's pronounced &quot;aSians&quot;, another time &quot;aSHians&quot;. Get these things straight.<br />
<br />
Setting up camp.... in the open... on snow, with a campfire... when there's perfectly good ruins to sleep in, providing a little protection from the wind etc. ... seriously...<br />
<br />
Starting a shot by showing the ass of a tiger also may not have been the best choice...<br />
<br />
I know I'm hard to please and some of those criticisms may be a bit too harsh but I feel at least some of them are warranted.</div></div><hr />

That's all.<br />

<br />
Exactly. There's no way to know what guild the person was in for this achievement.<br />
<br />
Just like there was no way to know if people killed any vanilla bosses before achievements were implemented without it completing a quest chain or them having an item on hand.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is the ONLY way they could do this achievement as a guild achievement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm very disappointed with this mentality. This is one of the worst ideas they could add to the game. We are legendary is as much about having done the stuff in the past as it is about doing it again.<br />
<br />
I think this will be generally considered annoying and really poor for any of the current established players.<br />
<br />
C'mon Blizzard, are you going to do anything for the established players? Or are you going to implement every single change with the mindset of &quot;anyone who played in WOTLK or prior should be on the exact same level as any fresh player&quot;? Please. Stop kicking your dedicated, long term, players around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyone in a relatively stable guild WILL sooner or later get the phoenix mount and all of the coolest rewards (which will render the whole system useless). They won't make it hard enough to get, just as they always hand out stuff.<br />
Also, there are guilds without 1000 people who grind daily lolquests or who want to farm old instances after wiping there often enough when they were the current raiding content already. <br />
<br />
Whole system is retarded in my eyes, it will just favor overpopulated guilds regardless of their actual skill level or raiding progress. The rewards will be too common and I think, the way to earn experience just isn't right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the problem with current WoW players. Every quest &quot;takes too long.&quot; I, for one, am going back to do all of these quests, regardless of how long they take, because *gasp* I enjoy them and don't care to powerlevel! Seriously, how do people play this game without having fun? It boggles me. Everything now is just &quot;gimme my exp, gimme my reward so I can use Questhelper to blaze through this next one.&quot;<br />
<br />
As for the guild cheevos, that sucks. I'm not much of a guild person (I like to float around the server in PuGs) but not making them retroactive is just, wow. Especially since these legendaries take weeks, unless you get lucky on KJ/Ill. I guess it makes people go back to the old content in WoW, maybe a little nostalgia.</div></div><hr />

I stopped watching the Machinima halfway through the second, and it was effort to get that far. It had a promising start. But...the voice acting was Lol, and not in a good way. Especially Tyrande. When they got to the part about Nihilum and Black Temple...<br />

There will be one, but If it is in the third tier instance than we're going to have to wait at least another year after the launch of Cata to access that legendary. The implementation of Atiesh was the worst of any legendary. It was in the last raid instance before an expansion so people were losing interest anyway, required bosses that were unkillable by all except a handful of the most elite guilds, an item in competition between healers and spell DPS. After all of this it was quickly replaced when players hit 70, while for tanking the heavily nerfed Thunderfury remained viable through most of Sunwell due to its superior threat. After all of that Blizzard decided to remove the only legendary caster DPS had access to. <br />
<br />
I have over 400 days played on my main, multiple server firsts. I've been in a top 50-100 world guild with 90% and higher attendance for the last four years killing every boss during progression, including stuff like pre-nerf Gruul, pre-nerf Shahraz, and other pound your head against the wall fights. Seeing semi-casuals running around with Shadowmourne is kind of infuriating. I'm glad after 7 years Blizzard finally might give caster DPS a viable legendary.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, I always thought that the elemental spec liked Imp. Shields for the extra mana regen. Whoopsie? :confused:<br />
<br />
We take it because there's really nothing better on the table, but when all is said and done it's really not a deciding factor in... well, anything, really, since mana regen is so far from a problem in WotLK that no one even considers it anymore.<br />
<br />
What confuses me is that I thought longevity was going to be re-introduced and stressed as an issue in Cataclysm. Maybe that's just for healers? Is Thunderstorm supposed to solve all of our mana issues? If we're supposed to be using Lightning Shield now it's pretty much gonna have to.<br />
<br />
By the way, kudos to you for using an FFT avatar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can someone with access to the Cata beta forums please post the question:<br />
<br />
What is the guild player requirement for farming OLD 20-man or 40-man raids? Because you don't need the full raid (which if you keep the same 4:5 ratio would mean 16/20 and 32/40 to be guild runs)<br />
<br />
If 2 people from the same guild 2-man Molten Core, does that count as a guild run? If they bring a 3rd non-guild player, does that no longer make it a guild run? What about 8/10 or 12/15 running a 20 or 40 man raid?<br />
<br />
This is especially important in light of farming old legendaries. We can 2-man (or even solo) MC but BWL and BT usually requires we drag a couple non-guild healers along with us. But it's usually around 10-15 people tops, which is problematic since if we had, say, 3-non guildies and 8 guildies in BWL if that meets the criteria for &quot;guild run&quot; or not.<br />
<br />
I'd imagine when you can similarly outgear Naxx etc the same question would apply.<br />
<br />
So I'd really appreciate if someone with post access on the Cata forums would ask for us so they figure it out now instead of after it goes live.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

Voice Acting was ok, but the sound quality ruined it. And some people you could tell was just reading a script, no life to their voice. The Plot was decent except it followed an entire Alliance Fanboy Playbase without even going into the Horde Side of things. I mean such as Apparently all the horde was bad and had joined Gul'dan even though in the start of the movie his own minions say that can't get the Horde to help. <br />
<br />
I was personally waiting for someone from the horde to walk in on the Undercity scene and be like &quot;Why have you come here?&quot;..I mean, the story starts off saying there is somewhat of a peace between them, but gives nothing else to it. They just go in there &quot;OH NO THEY SENSED US&quot; and they kill Forsaken. Nothing to it. If they can actually get some story with the horde in there (not saying have an entire movie to it) just stating that the horde are not part of Gul'dan's army, then I will feel better. But right now, the story line of it just seems completely off.</div></div><hr />

The voice acting killed it for me,they used Lord of The Rings music in several scenes.<br />
Some of the camera angles were horrible.<br />
<br />
Not only did they use the LOTR music in some parts, but I'm pretty sure that line &quot;leave none alive&quot; and at least 2 other quotes by that Guldan character were taken directly from LOTR dialogue. &quot;leave none alive&quot; is what Saruman says during his speech to the orcs he sent to Helms Deep.<br />

yup that is exactly what i was thinking also. the voice acting is completely terrible. and sadly those are apparently the better voice actors in the Machinima Community? no offense, but i didnt even get past the 2nd part of the video either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A shame that Nick Shaw(voice of Blazer in TotP) agreed to be voicing in the movie. It's far to un-legendary for him.<br />
Script was very poor tbh. <br />
The into was quite good but would have been more suited for a later chapter and not as introducion to the whole series. Not the voice part but the music and landscape shots.<br />
Using every single &quot;epic&quot; music you can find and slash it all together does not make good background music and does not give the story an epic touch.<br />
With the high standards of todays machinimas, in-game shoots wont do. More model viewer and after effects are a must.<br />
And please enough with the over-used movie quotes.<br />
<br />
Overall, for a machinima that claims to be &quot;the next big machinima project like TotP&quot; it was a HUGE let-down but atleast you'll get ALOT of feedback on what to improve(everything) but atleast someone is trying. Season 3 of chronicles of the annoying quest is taking forever and most of the good old creators are chilling or have quit so there's deffinetly need for new faces.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Midgardian</div><div class="date">2010-08-19, 01:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It really makes me sad that people actually spend four years of their life making a &quot;movie&quot; from video game scenes (regardless of whether it's 'good' or not, which is subjective). I mean, people make wonderful movies that are enjoyed by millions of people in less time than that, and actually have some impact. You can do a lot in four years. But this?<br />
<br />
This relates to the subjective part. This Machinima was just a generic fantasy story, with no regard for lore, that was a lot of random gank scenes, a lot of overused dramatic film music, and a lot of unoriginal plot. Not only are they using music, quotes, and plot from other movies, they are using an entire video game universe as their setting, so there is absolutely nothing original, except the fact that they are putting RP stories with no connection to lore in the Warcraft universe. And they are narrowing that universe. The reason a lot of fantasy stories are 'epic' is because they allow the audience to explore a universe simultaneously with the characters. LOTR was successful as a movie adaptation because it allowed fans, and others, to visually explore Middle-Earth, and see it through the eyes of a variety of characters (what was mere words, and an epic setting, became an actual working universe). However, we already have a visual of the Warcraft universe. We can play it whenever we want. So why spend four years crafting a very narrow interpretation of that universe?<br />
<br />
Edit: And I certainly mean no offense. I know it's difficult when you spend a lot of time on something, and it receives a lot of negative criticism. I merely want to point out that there are plenty of things you can do, in less than four years, that would reach even wider audiences. It's hard to be taken seriously when you are devoting your time to being a &quot;WoW&quot; celebrity. You will have some fans, of course. But the question I'd ask myself, if it were me, is: What am I actually contributing to people? Am I actually contributing something meaningful? Something that is enjoyable, and that will leave a lasting impression?</div></div><hr />

Unlike Jesse, I'm not a nice guy at all and will happily flatten you with my ego :&gt; Jesse and I do the best Cataclysm videos on the internet. Fact. Nobody gives a flying fuck about your dumb opinion. Both of us get paid to talk about videogames on the internet, you don't. Why? Because nobody gives a flying fuck about your dumb opinion. Both of us are paid voice-actors and presenters and have the resumes to prove it. This is why nobody gives a flying fuck about your dumb opinion of our voices or presentation styles. Just as your negative opinion about a professional footballer who is vastly better at football than you is dumb and doesn't matter, so your opinion on professional commentators who are vastly better at talking about videogames than you doesn't matter. <br />
<br />
Basically, we &gt; you, this will always be the case and that is why you are so angry. Sadly, you're also so impotent and nothing you can say, do or posture is going to change the fact that we &gt; you. To ensure you remember this fact, I wrote you a short poem.<br />

<br />
Well, he should say what he means then..<br />
<br />
And anyway that Legendary was still BIS for many caster dps despite the healing proc on it. In Ulduar I would have fricken LOVED to have had one of those bad boys.</div></div><hr />

Unlike Jesse, I'm not a nice guy at all and will happily flatten you with my ego :&gt; Jesse and I do the best Cataclysm videos on the internet. Fact. Nobody gives a flying fuck about your dumb opinion. Both of us get paid to talk about videogames on the internet, you don't. Why?

Basically, we &gt; you, this will always be the case and that is why you are so angry. Sadly, you're also so impotent and nothing you can say, do or posture is going to change the fact that we &gt; you. To ensure you remember this fact, I wrote you a short poem.<br />

Well, now I know what 'Biscuit' is a euphemism for. :P<br />
<br />
Honestly, I'm more in the 'I'm jealous but I don't dislike you' crowd. I started watching the Tauren Paladin video and thought it was pretty cool... I only stopped because playing WoW &gt; than watching videos. Especially at raid time.</div></div><hr />

From that bout of nerd rage your more like a limpbiscuit now buddy.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Edited because hey, I love stupid people with big ego's. So allow me to point out the jist of your rant here on the forums for the masses. Everyone who critiqued your videos are unable to do so without retribution because our opinions are &quot;dumb&quot; and no one gives a &quot;flying fuck&quot;? Last I checked freedom of speech was ever prevelant on the internet. If you think people are going to stop calling your crap out because you have an overinflated ego over a podcast that you uncreatively made over someone elses game, think again. Though seeing you respond to my post was rather heartening, it made me see that under the podcast, your just as much an annoying blowhard as you are when you vibrate your vocal cords to produce the whining sounds that appear in your videos.<br />

Also means nobody can like the videos either, because we're not all voice actors who get paid for voice acting, so our opinions are 'dumb' and no one gives a 'flying fuck'...<br />

Surprisingly I think the people agree with totalbiscuit. He's alot more loveable than you my friend. You just seem like some pissed off nerd?. And i'm also pretty sure 'people' who call this 'crap' out. Is pretty much just you on this thread. And by replying to his post your ego is as massive as biscuits. Also, when it comes to commenting gaming<br />

<br />
Your close-mindedness makes sure you forget one important detail. If someone is liked, there is surely an equal amount of people that dislike that person as well. Idiots like yourself are too shut in to realize that. I do like how you called my trolling nerd rage though, that gave me a giggle. I lurk this cesspit in the hopes of getting lulz and pissing off imbeciles, followers, and mongoloids much like yourself. To actually call &quot;trolling&quot; nerd rage, is a pathetic attempt at trolling the troller. LimpBiscuit however, is nerd raging by defending his WoW podcast in the manner he did. Its really simple to see, but it eludes brown nosers like yourself. No surprise there considering LimpBiscuit and Jesse Cocks are just massive money consuming assholes, taking off WoW's success because they are too uncreative to form their own podcast, how could someone so deep in that hole even see the other side?<br />
<br />
Since I'm feeling particularly in a good mood, I'll address that second half of your brown nosing with simply this: Why do I care LimpBiscuit is better at commenting on games than me. If that's really your only way of showing how he is better than me, just please stop fueling the embers of this dead thread right now. Your only looking more stupid than you already are. Lastly, and I'm going to be blunt here, I couldn't give a flying fuck (Hurr hurr, like what I did there LimpBiscuit?) if some wanna-be troll combatant/podcaster is more lovable. To just as many, he isn't and never will be because of his ego, and the fact he is an uncreative hack leeching off of WoW's success. Jesse Cocks and LimpBiscuit DO have something however that makes them unique and ACTUALLY talented however, and that is a podcasters voice. Its a shame its wasted on them.<br />
<br />

Yeah, now I'm definitely not watching your videos anymore. You don't know what people here do. You think you are better than any other random person because you make videos about World of Warcraft? That's particularly sad, actually. I honestly have no problems with your voices. You could sound eight hundred times more annoying and I wouldn't care, because it's the actual content of what you say that matters to me. (So, basically, what I'm saying is, the fact that you think that your voice entitles you to be better than everyone else is very silly).<br />
<br />
Fact. What I've seen you talk about in your videos, anyone can do. You ramble, and are often wrong. That's fine. But don't pretend you're better than anyone else. &quot;This may be that, or that, or this.&quot; Yeah, thanks, I can figure that out on my own. You speculate about World of Warcraft in videos, and you do &quot;voice acting.&quot; Yay for you. You're doing great things for the world.<br />
<br />
Then you have the gall to say something like that?</div></div><hr />

It's still pretty arrogant.</div></div><hr />
