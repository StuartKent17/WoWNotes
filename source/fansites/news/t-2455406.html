Tides of Vengeance Updated Patch Notes<br />
<br />
The war raging across Azeroth between Alliance and Horde has intensified. As the Alliance lays plans to retake Darkshore and regain a foothold in Kalimdor, both factions have redoubled their attacks across the zones of Kul Tiras and Zandalar.<br />
<br />
War Campaign<br />
<br />
<br />
New Questlines<br />
<br />
<br />
New chapters in the War Campaign are now available. Head to Boralus or Zuldazar to rejoin your faction’s war efforts.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
New Missions<br />
<br />
<br />
Several new Missions are now available at both your War Table, as well as from new drops from various activities, such as Island Expeditions. Look for new Missions to upgrade your faction’s outposts, level up followers so that they gain access to a new equipment slot, send your followers on lucrative new weekly treasure hunts, and unlock a vendor who offers the opposing faction’s pets.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Faction Assaults <br />
<br />
<br />
Periodically, the Alliance or the Horde will launch an assault against a hostile position in Kul Tiras or Zandalar. When an Assault is active, a group of new World Quests will be available to both factions in that area. Rally to the location to fight on behalf of your faction and earn new Honorbound or 7th Legion Service Medals that can be exchanged for a variety of rewards.<br />
Players who have unlocked World Quests at level 120 on at least one character will have Assault World Quests available to any of their other characters.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Warfront: The Battle for Darkshore<br />
<br />
The conflict over the home of the night elves has reached a fever pitch, and new questlines will lead you to the all-new Battle for Darkshore. In this new Warfront, you’ll unlock access to powerful hero transformations that give you temporary abilities themed around your role as a tank, healer, or damage dealer.<br />
<br />
<br />
Contributions for Darkshore as well as the Stromgarde Warfront now operate on a daily cycle. When resources are being mustered, three quartermasters will each put out a request for a different contribution each day. The requested turn-ins have also been adjusted to be more consistent in their value.<br />
When your faction controls either Arathi Highlands or Darkshore, world quests will now be available in those zones, in place of the once-per-cycle kill quests that were previously offered for Arathi.<br />
<br />
<br />
Heritage Armor Questlines<br />
<br />
New questlines to find and obtain new Heritage armor are available to two mighty races – the dwarves and the blood elves. Available at level 120 to dwarves who are Exalted with Ironforge and blood elves who are exalted with Silvermoon, look for “Keep Yer Feet on the Ground” at the Stormwind Embassy, or “The Pride of the Sin’dorei” at the Orgrimmar Embassy, and get started rediscovering your heritage.<br />
<br />
Island Expeditions<br />
<br />
Scouts have discovered two new destinations for Island Expeditions – the vrykul land of Jorundall and the Gilnean town of Havenswood. These, as well as the previous Island Expeditions, now feature new enemies, achievements, events, items, and vendors.<br />
<br />
<br />
The logic used to spawn Island Expeditions has been adjusted to favor more organic concentrations of foes, with more clear paths in between, to make it easier to navigate without being forced into combat.<br />
The chance for cosmetic rewards are now based on all the enemies and Azerite present on the island, and no longer tied to only the enemy camps your team defeats. Completing an Island Expedition at a higher difficulty increases the chance of receiving these bonus rewards.<br />
Battle pets rewarded from the completion of islands that were previously uncageable can now be caged.<br />
The weekly quest to recover Azerite now requires 36,000 Azerite (was 40,000).<br />
Mythic and PvP Islands now reward 350 Artifact Power (was 300), and PvP Islands now award 50 Conquest on a win (was 8).<br />
The weekly Island Expedition quest, and progress towards it, are now visible on the world map.<br />
The Island Expedition weekly quest now rewards lucrative new treasure map Missions for your followers.<br />
Look for new vendors in Boralus and Dazar’alor who offer exclusive rewards in exchange for your Seafarer’s Dubloons.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons and Raids<br />
<br />
<br />
You can now speak to Archmage Timear in Dalaran above the Broken Isles to access Legion Raid Finder solo or with a private group.<br />
Siege of Boralus and Kings’ Rest are now available on Heroic difficulty.<br />
Mythic Keystones can no longer be deleted.<br />
The new Raid: Battle of Dazar’alor, and Season 2 for PvP and Mythic Keystone Dungeons will begin with the weekly reset in each region starting on January 22, 2019.<br />
<br />
<br />
Achievements<br />
<br />
<br />
Many new achievements related to the new Assaults, Island Expeditions, and Warfront are now available.<br />
Two new Mythic Keystone Feats of Strength are now available. To earn them, complete all available Battle for Azeroth Mythic Keystone dungeons before the time limit, at +10 and +15 difficulty, by the end of the season.<br />
The Family Battler achievement has arrived. Complete 10 challenging family-only pet battle achievements in Kul Tiras and Zandalar to earn your new Wicker Wraith pet.<br />
Progress toward the new 100 Exalted Reputations achievement is account-wide. Complete it to earn the Pureheart Courser mount and the “Esteemed” title.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items and Rewards<br />
<br />
<br />
Account-bound maps to unlock many flight points on Kul Tiras and Zandalar can be purchased from the War Campaign emissary to send to your alts.<br />

Azerite Gear Vendor<br />
<br />
<br />
You can now target specific kinds of Azerite armor by earning Titan Residuum, which can be used to purchase Azerite armor from everyone’s favorite purveyor of exquisite furnishings: Thaumaturge Vashreen.<br />
The item contained in your Mythic Keystone weekly cache can no longer be a piece of Azerite gear. You’ll now receive an amount of Titan Residuum in addition to your weekly item.<br />
Higher-level Keystones return greater amounts of Titan Residuum from your weekly cache.<br />
Scrapping or disenchanting new epic-quality Azerite gear obtained in Tides of Vengeance (from any source) also provides Titan Residuum.<br />
Thaumaturge Vashreen currently offers slot-specific tokens for Azerite gear, equivalent to item levels from Normal, Heroic, and Mythic Uldir.<br />
Additionally, specific pieces of Mythic Raid item level Azerite gear may be purchased at a premium price.<br />
There is no cap on the amount of Titan Residuum you may collect.<br />
When Season 2 begins, Thaumaturge Vashreen will offer new, higher item-level Azerite items at higher Residuum asking prices, while the weekly Mythic Keystone chest reward and the Residuum obtained from destroying higher item-level Azerite pieces increases proportionally.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
You’re called to an all-new pet dungeon experience. Pick up your first quest to head to Gnomeregan from Radek Fuselock in Dazar’alor or Tizzy Gearjolt in Boralus. You’ll find the new vendor Micro Zoox just outside Gnomeregan, offering four new companions: Mechanical Cockroach, Leper Rat, Mechantula (a schematic for Engineers to craft and trade), and everyone’s best friend, Alarm-o-Dog.<br />
<br />
<br />
Completing the normal version of the pet dungeon rewards an Ultimate Battle-Training Stone, and completing the Challenge version rewards your very own Mini Spider Tank pet.<br />
<br />

If you have a transmogrified appearance that isn’t considered valid for the race you change in to, the transmog will be removed and your equipped armor will show, subject to the same faction split.<br />

Have you tried it?<br />
<br />
I haven't but I'm hoping its fun. When they first announced pet dungeons a while back, I was pumped until I tried one and it was a faceroll with no strategy or difficulty. If I remember correctly, you just equipped 3 zandalari pets and destroyed it. Basically boring as f#.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd love to see them get back to more interesting and challenging pet content like the MoP celestial tournament. That thing was frustrating at times but also a lot of fun, challenging, and you felt like it was a real event. It also forced you to go out and get specific pets to be able to beat it.<br />
<br />
Will check this one out and fingers crossed.</div></div><hr />

I'm starting to think you are one of those that just joins, uses a spell and then wait while you see netflix on the other screen. <br />
<br />
So.. you are alone with shitty gear (fresh 120 not 110)... you get into one of those 5 mans group :D<br />
<br />
And in the case you have a friend, you truly can't kill it using cd's? the both of you? or the friend thing you said was just an excuse so you could continue just grouping with 20 people to kill a rare and just hit it with a basic spell, bad news it seems, you have to make more effort and actually work with less people and that requires more communication than 20 randoms killing it in 10 seconds, so your &quot;social&quot; argument os also flawed.</div></div><hr />
