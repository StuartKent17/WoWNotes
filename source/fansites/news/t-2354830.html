Why did he turn red suddenly? I expected Sargeras to take control of him which would turn him red, but it doesn't seem like that's the case. The transition between the two phases is completely identical as well, and the phase is just... slightly different. It doesn't feel unique like the Mythic Gul'dan encounter did. Really a shame that the first tier ended with a much cooler mythic only phase than the final raid of the expansion.</div></div><hr />

sargeras is the clouds. they're a part of a titan's body.<br />

No constellation phase in mythic. The phase is too easy for a mythic group so they probably just decided to skip it since it just prolongs the fight.</div></div><hr />

This. If they would want to use Sargeras, he would be in every difficulty. Blizz clearly saved him for another expansion.<br />
<br />
I think Void Lords will get him at some point (oh the irony) and he will be final boss, maybe even for WoW last (important) expansion.</div></div><hr />

It's kind of a disservice to method and anyone chasing world firsts to put down such an accomplishment and say it wasn't what you hoped for. These guys worked long, tireless hours to get this done. Was it as hard as TOS? Clearly not, but it was still a good fight. Maybe you're expecting too much.<br />

Also, do we have confirmation that this is the last raid of Legion? I've read that this ties up the legion storyline, but I've never seen anything official stating it is the final raid zone unless I'm missing something.</div></div><hr />

They aren't putting down method. They are disappointed in a boss fight with someone who was ~20 years in the making and turned out to be a bunch of nothing. Like that's really how we end the whole Sargeras/Burning Legion plotline? They've been in game since original Warcraft and it turned into kind of a joke in game. Lich King and Garrosh had WAY cooler endings. This was just... oh hey he's red now. I'm sure the boss is hard and it's not making light of their accomplishment in getting a WF kill. Just the boss fight itself was a big nothing burger.</div></div><hr />

Such shortsightedness. His story isn't done yet. We fought the Argus world soul. A pretty epic conclusion to the burning legion storyline. But the mad titan's story-line is still ongoing and will most likely be a big part of our encounter with the void lords some day. They're just trying to not make the same mistake they made with illidan and kill off a long beloved and heavily developed character too soon when he could play a sweet role in later expansions. Considering they plan at least 2 expansions ahead of the current, I'm sure they already have a plan for him.</div></div><hr />

They did not come off their asses, but they did help. One of them does the air/water orbs, Eonar does the revive tree, Khaz'goroth titanforges and Aman'thul hits Argus so hard that he transitions from phase 2 to 3.<br />

Don't be silly. We're just &quot;a group of heroes&quot; in the lore and always will be. It's easy and necessary to write that off.<br />
It just feels stupid to kill a hard boss and have Thrall swoop in to claim the victory. That was a major point of backlash in Cataclysm.</div></div><hr />

Highmaul we had the extra cho'gall phase,<br />
HFC we had the extra archimond phase in the twisting nether.<br />
Antorus we have a colour swap empowered Argus. <br />
<br />
Nothing visually amazing, nothing encounterwise amazing. Many of the abilities are just empowered versions of earlier abilities (the scythe and the exploding orb) or abilities from earlier in the fight (death fog and the mythic only spread circles). The only new thing is the orbs that can't reach the boss. Compared to previous mythic only encounters/phases this one has the least new stuff going on.<br />
<br />
I guess part of the disappointment comes from the fact its an ending to a long going story with the burning legion and sargeras.<br />
<br />
My secret hope was that aman'thul cleansed argus, argus powered us up and with his power up we flew to azeroth and stabbed sargeras in the face to weaken him so that the titans can rip him away from azeroth. Would have been a much more visually appealing ending to it all and more in line with previous mythic only stuff.</div></div><hr />

I hoped so much for this too.<br />
Pretty disappointed by this.<br />
I mean it's clear that blizzard is keeping him in the background until we truly go against the voidlords but this shouldn't have stopped us from a phase were we weaken him as you said.<br />
Not be able to actually fight against the 20 year build up big baddie is just such a letdown. The next time he will get relevant he probably helps us out against the voidlords and we wont fight him either.</div></div><hr />

It's probably the fact that we all keept watching harder bosses (which these guilds struggled a lot more) and then the end to one of the longest storylines from Warcraft is just &quot;meh&quot; instead of something like LK fight was for the entire scourge/LK storyline.</div></div><hr />

On normal/hc scythes are way too obvious. It was a nice tactic to call the whole raid to release simultaneously. <br />

It is clear that Sargeras should have been the final raid boss, even if we didn't kill him. Argus just dropped out of nowhere and nobody cares. He went red boys. Wooow! So epic!</div></div><hr />

They did not come off their asses, but they did help. One of them does the air/water orbs, Eonar does the revive tree, Khaz'goroth titanforges and Aman'thul hits Argus so hard that he transitions from phase 2 to 3.<br />

No new phase, really, just a different set of 'drop poo and move' type of thing.<br />

That make just no sense to compare them<br />

Im Pretty sure the only reason why they wiped so often was the Enrage Timer. 12 Minutes this was a 11:30 Minutes Fight. With Gear from the Second Week. So im PRETTY DAMN SURE they just wiped so often because it was nearly impossible with the First gear to kill Argus before he Enrage.</div></div><hr />

I won't count the Sargy's debuffs as they're here throughout the encounter anyway.<br />

I dunno, I have the feeling we're missing something here. Gul'dan's Mythic phase was impressive, this one is meh (and it replaces 2 entirely different phases of the regular encounter).<br />

GD's mythic phase wasn't that impressive, it was impressive un-nerfed, but when it was nerfed it was almost a total pushover once you got there, unless your mages fucked up the orbs (obviously). The problem with their mythic only phases in the past is that they are generally just a way to prolong to fight and they generally tune it that easily you won't spend much time there either, just getting there is the more difficult part (looking at Garrosh, Imperator, GD).<br />
<br />
I think Sha of Fear H and Argus M are one of the few mythic/heroic only phases that weren't real pushovers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand what you are saying but I'm more speaking about the overall entertainment of these phases. Either by the fact it's lore-heavy, or mechanics-wise.<br />
<br />
I kinda liked the Mar'gok's mythic phase (on a general way I really enjoyed this fight), Gul'dan's phase I only did it very, very late so I couldn't really judge, but at least it was really interesting to encounter Illidan's demon within.<br />
And in this point of view, Argus seems lackluster. Because everything is mainly recolor from Heroic, and that may be the first time in WoW's history that you have a phase entirely disappearing from the encounter. Plus, the mythic phase itself is very bland with no new lore element (could've been tons of things, Void stuff, Sargeras' manifestation through whatever, Azeroth's manifestation through whatever...), and the most disappointing fact, in my opinion, is that there was no implication from any important lore character.<br />
<br />
I mean, come on, we killed Kil'jaeden with Velen and Illidan far far behind us, now we kill Argus with literally nobody near us. Lich King was killed thanks to Tyrion, Khadgar fights with us against Gul'dan, and during the complete Antorus raid, those heroes are nowhere to be found, except Magni who's here as a master in teleportation.<br />
<br />
Edit : well, ok, we have the Pantheon :D<br />
<br />
I would've hope that any of these characters would've intervene during this fight. They didn't (except for the cinematic where they spawn from nowhere).</div></div><hr />
