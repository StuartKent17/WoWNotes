Patch 4.3.2 64-bit Client Available<br />
A 64-bit client is once again available for use with Patch 4.3.2. Before being able to launch WoW in 64-bit mode you will need to download the 64-bit client for PC/Mac (using one of the links below), and unzip it into your World of Warcraft directory. Once you extract the files you can start the 64-bit client by opening the Launcher as normal (Run as Administrator if applicable). To switch back to the 32-bit client, go into Options -&gt; Game Preferences, and check the Launch 32-bit client setting. The game will display which version you are using at the bottom left hand corner of the login screen. ex: Version 4.3.2 (15211) (Release x64)<br />
<br />
Build 4.3.2.15211 - PC link (http://us.media.battle.net.edgesuite.net/downloads/wow-installers/live/WoWLive-64-Win-15211.zip), Mac link (http://us.media.battle.net.edgesuite.net/downloads/wow-installers/live/WoWLive-64-Mac-15211.zip)<br />
<br />
**Important things to keep in mind**<br />
<br />
The 64-bit client is being distributed separately from the Retail version as it is not yet supported for use with World of Warcraft. Launching the game in 64-bit mode can only be done after patching the game to version 4.3.2, downloading and extracting the necessary files. The game’s built in voice chat does not currently work when using the 64-bit client. [Mac] The 64-bit Mac client does not currently support the in-game movie recording functionality. [Mac] The 64-bit Mac client iTunes' Remote feature does not work at the present time. [Mac] The 64-bit Mac client does not currently support the customized LCD display for the Logitech G15 series of keyboards. [Mac] The 64-bit Mac client is currently not supported on 10.5 systems. You will need 10.6.8 or later for this version.<br />
<br />
<br />

Mists of Pandaria Blue Posts<br />
Mists of Pandaria and a Change in Attitude<br />
It's great to see some positive discussion and speculation about where this game is headed.<br />
<br />
We're definitely very focused on opening the doors a little wider to new ideas to really grasp onto what will make this game as fun as possible. It's 7 years old after all. We're not going to reinvent the wheel in Mists of Pandaria, but we want to introduce new types of compelling content with meaningful reward structures so your progression paths don't feel quite as redundant.<br />
<br />
You'll get a captivating story, breathtaking new lands to explore, a wide array of new and awesome good/bad guys (from what I've seen, REALLY awesome), a slew of new dungeons and raids, a new playable race, a new class, many outstanding systems improvements, etc.<br />
<br />
We hope these features are more or less to be expected with virtually every expansion. But this time we're also pouring our heart and soul into some really fun new features that'll allow you to progress in slightly less conventional ways.<br />
<br />
I get so excited every time I meet with Greg Street, Cory Stockton, Dave Kosak, and Tom Chilton to discuss everything they're working on each week. It's even got me logging into some of the characters I haven't played in a while more often lately, just because I want to be fully prepared to diversify my gameplay and explore different avenues of content on different characters.<br />
<br />
I think it's really going to be about playing the game the way you want to play it, without feeling entirely like you're missing out on valuable rewards. <br />
<br />
[...] Yesterday we discussed low-population and faction-imbalanced realms with our developers. They have some pretty bold and spectacular plans for addressing this in anticipation of implementing some of the features we plan to in Mists. I just don't have a lot of information to share with you at this stage of programming and development. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/216714-wow-is-having-a-turn-around-back-to-quality/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3988400920?page=2#40))<br />
<br />
Pandaren Mounts<br />
The pandaren mount is still being finalized, so what you’ve heard (or seen) are just rumors at this point. Obviously we want the mount to be something awesome, which will take some time to perfect. In addition to the pandaren mount, expect to see a ton of new mounts in Mists of Pandaria. In fact, if any of the new creatures being added in the next expansion look up to the task, I’m sure the developers are looking for ways to throw a saddle on them so they can adventure through Azeroth with our heroes. Though I’m sure some are more comical looking than others. :P Anyway, once the information is ready, we’ll get it out to all of you. Trust! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/216678-sopanda-mounts/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3988231087?page=2#24))<br />
<br />
Future Mists of Pandaria News<br />
We'll be keeping everyone informed. Don't worry. We can't give time frames right now. As you know, we usually say it will be ready when it's ready. That said, I can reiterate that we are pushing forward very well on the next expansion and again point out that we were able to show so much at BlizzCon for a reason. I am not going to reassure you of when we intend for this to come out since I don't have that authority or permission to do so as of yet. <br />
<br />
We're completely aware of how quickly players consume content. We're also aware that not all players have consumed all of the current content either. Does that make us less aware that there are many who are ready for more? No. But, we want to make sure we deliver our best with Mists of Pandaria and it won't be long until you start seeing a lot more of what we have in store for it and for you. <br />
<br />
There are a lot of misconceptions floating around and being repeated that are based on what you believe is correct information or at least suppositions. Again, I am not in a position to clarify or negate those misconceptions beyond what I've said here. At least not yet. Hopefully, it won't be long before you will get that &quot;big picture&quot; look that you've been hoping for.<br />
<br />
We do have a plan to update the calculator with all of the changes that have been made (thus far based on constructive community feedback and internal testing) in the near future. I don't want to promise any particular date as of yet, though it could be mid-month that we're able to make those updates. As always, this is not a firm date/promise right now, it's just a guesstimate of when we may be able to update again. When we do update, we'll make sure to let you all know.<br />
<br />
We did have a lot to show during BlizzCon including zone fly-throughs, the starting area for the pandaren etc. (It was definitely a lot.) <br />
<br />
I can't give you an update on where we are currently (that has to wait for the media), but I think the media event will be a great way for everyone to get a good look at it again and see for themselves. The female pandaren model is in progress. We're just not quite ready to show her yet though or discuss her. I can say though that it will not be the male model with a title over her head that says, &quot;I'm a girl&quot; any longer though. <br />
<br />
We are most definitely not dismissing concerns. We have regular meetings and do reports each week specifically to point out the current concerns and issues the community is discussing. Perhaps it may seem dismissive if we aren't agreeing with an idea or sentiment, but that doesn't mean that we aren't still discussing it in some way.<br />
<br />
You have no need to ask for forgiveness for wanting to know more. We fully intend to deliver more and we did cover a lot of it during BlizzCon as well. We'll be refreshing that information however and moving you all forward with us by letting you know how things have advanced/changed and developed since then though. <br />
<br />
We love your questions. We just may not be able to answer them all when or how you want. We may on occasion be a bit more silent about things than you (or we) might like, but as I've said in the past, there is a method to the madness.<br />
<br />
What we always want to make sure of though, is that if people are asking questions or sharing feedback, that it be done constructively. We don't mind negative or viewpoints that aren't shiny and happy as long as they are done in a way that is constructive and doesn't become defamatory toward other posters or Blizzard employees. This is a place for discussions and it's important that when we come here to discuss, we do so with some thought and care for the people sitting behind the keyboards on both ends of the spectrum. <br />
<br />
In short, we care. We care a lot. We may not always show it perfectly, but we love the community we have and we love the work we do.<br />
<br />
Neth, I don't suppose you have any comment on how beta invites will be working for Annual Subs?<br />
<br />
I can't comment on this yet, but we will be putting together information on how everyone will be getting into the beta including those that signed up for the World of Warcraft Annual Pass. We know it's something people are concerned about and we want to make sure that we're as clear as possible on the process.

Blacksmithing and Epic Gems<br />
This is only the case if you assume that everyone is fully decked out in the epic Jewelcrafting gems. Due to the drop-rate being quite low and the cost to buy them quite high, it is not really feasible that the average player will be able to acquire enough of these gems while the 4.3 content is still current to create an issue. We feel the benefits that Blacksmithing offers balance out very well when compared to the difficulty of obtaining epic gems, as such we do not currently have any changes planned in regards to this. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/216697-jewelcrafting-issue/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3313061541#3))<br />
<br />
Transmogrification and the Future<br />
Remember that Transmogrification isn't 'done', and that more changes might come in the future. At first, we had concerns that if we allowed non-ranged weapons to be transmogrified into completely different weapons that they would lose a sense of flavor and identity. Our perspective may be changing on that front, though, and over time the current restrictions could be eased further.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it's because hunter ranged weapons each make a distinct sound that they were a bit more loosely restricted in this first pass. I'm sure that the hunters in the audience can explain why that's valuable. <br />
<br />
We really, really want to avoid accidentally going to far then find ourselves in the position of having to take options away. There's not really a specific timeline established, no. I think it's reasonable to look forward to incremental changes, as we have time to implement them, and as they make sense. We're also looking at finding new ways of making Transmogrification fun and rewarding.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I don't currently see a future where all restrictions are dropped completely, but I've learned that it's also generally wise to avoid the word &quot;never&quot;. <br />
<br />
What about lightening up on restrictions?<br />
We still want Transmogrification to evolve, so that's still likely.<br />
<br />
Why aren't there anymore 2H caster maces? Or strength polearms?<br />
We've moved away from making really &quot;wacky&quot; decisions about item stat assignment to make weapon selection more intuitive. These aren't rules that are written in stone, of course, just general guidelines we've been following to make it more clear which classes a particular type of item is likely to be good for. <br />
<br />
How about the main hand weapons, is there any reason we cant mog these?<br />
The one hand/main hand/offhand restriction is also something we're looking at. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/216709-transmogging-weapons/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3988231744#16))<br />

Glyph Inscription Leveling<br />
The Book of Glyph Mastery (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/45912/book-of-glyph-mastery/) is actually a topic we’ve been discussing in our meetings. I can’t make any promises just yet but can at least acknowledge that we’re tossing around ideas for the book and for researching new Inscription glyphs. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/216659-glyph-inscription-leveling/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3988399966?page=1#2))<br />
<br />
Changes Made to WoW<br />
Take LFG. Yes, convenient, it's quick, it's good! But at the same time it destroyed server communities and turned the whole experience of going to dungeons from a fun adventure into a mini-game grindfest. Overal? Bad change in my opinion.<br />
The option to manually find people for your group and travel to the dungeon is still there, so you're totally free to continue doing it that way if you wish. But LFD is a very handy and convenient tool for most people, its popularity demonstrates that beyond a doubt.<br />
<br />
Having said that, we're very aware of these concerns, and we're working hard on ways to get players out of the cities and back into the world again in Mists.<br />
<br />
Take talent trees. They are forcing us to choose. Okay, neat, that's a bit more interesting. Downside? Only 6 points, means levelling will be even more boring. Can't really judge this one yet though.<br />
So currently you get to pick a new talent point every two levels. If, like me, you’ve researched your optimum spec online, gaining a point simply means selecting whichever talent my favoured guide tells me to choose. This could mean, for instance, a very small increase in the effectiveness of one particular skill, which isn’t terrible exciting, and doesn’t always make a huge immediate difference to your game play. With the new talent trees, every time you get to spend a point, it should be on something very significant and useful.<br />
<br />
Instantly learning abilities as you level up without a need to visit a trainer. Convenient? Yes. But also completely ruining what little experience you had left of living in an actual world of warcraft. BAD change.<br />
Bearing in mind how quickly it’s possible to level, it’s not always fun to break from questing just to take a trip back to town when you gain access to a new skill. Personally speaking, I tend to wait until I need to return for a few reasons, such as using the Auction House, bank, visiting the profession trainer etc. meaning I will sometimes go for a few levels without picking up that new skill. There are still plenty of things to keep you travelling to the cities and back while levelling, but when it’s convenient for you to do so, not when you ‘should’.<br />
<br />
You're basically telling us that we're wrong for not liking these features of WoW, because the numbers are against us. A lot of people use LFG, so that must mean it is fantastic?<br />
No I'm not saying that at all, but it's clear that many people appreciate it. The point you make about a path of least resistance is true, but it's a fine balance. Make something too easy (such as a free gear vendor) and it's no fun, no challenge. LFD keeps the challenge part (the dungeon) but alleviates the often-long-winded group-finding part, allowing people to quest or gather mats, just go about other tasks while a group is found for them. Granted, it's not for everyone, some people enjoy putting a group together personally but, again, we're not forcing anyone to use it.<br />
<br />
As I said just now, we've acknowledged people might have issues with some of the changes LFD made to the game. We're hearing it loud and clear, and we're working to address some of these in the expansion.

They tried saying this for instances too. Whether there's a 15% health/healing/damage increase, or easy bosses, or free and instant teleports to the instance/raid, there will always be a bias toward their LFG system.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The point most are trying to make is LFG is the reason their isn't any semi balance of community anymore. People can group with four other random people from a group of over 10m(?). If someone wasn't dpsing properly most groups just kick them and have a new person in there faster then it would be to tell them the best rotation for them or actually just help them to be a better player. People stopped helping each other when the lfg thing came around. No one will stop to explain boss fights any more, No one listens to anyone else in the party anymore. No one matters. Prime example, is when you tell the dps to kill the ghosty adds at the end of zg because you're a druid healer and they will stick to you like glue... Then they dont. Then you die. Then you do it again... and again. Then the healer gets blamed each time after telling them to kill the adds... Only for the healer to not be listened to and thus.. wipe again resulting in people either leaving or the healer getting /kicked for being a &quot;bad.&quot; cause hes unable to withstand a few dozen ghosts wacking away at his health with 20k hits... Not that I couldn't kite them but when they get to a certain point..... Its a smidge hard to dodge out of range for each one.. while staying WITHIN range to heal them. kinda gets a litttttle crowded.<br />
<br />
Which that sort of attitude is all thanks to LFG its easier to leave party or kick someone then it is to actually listen or explain. Where as, if you're restricted by server then being a douchebag, or a ninja, or what have you has repercussions and people actually act like human beings to one another instead of treating them like a health buffer, a meatshield.. people actually respect one another when you stay within your community. With lfg. No one cares about another person and they're all to quick to blame someone else or w/e. Sure lfg was great for the fact it helped balance out the server's for dungeons and what not... Sure it makes running dungeons easier. But going cross server, made the way you treat other people... Not matter. just my .02% based solely on what i've encountered while dpsing and healing.</div></div><hr />

No, that's why they removed the option to disable it. There's no buff to disable.</div></div><hr />

Roughly half of the European servers are pretty much wastelands and people just transfer their guilds to about 10 servers which rose to 20-25k population when guild transfers became available. We just transfered our guild too, since our server was unbelievably dead. They could easily merge the low pop realms and just take offline about 20 realms. I'd agree that all this automatisation takes some fun out of the game, where you have to actually do something instead of placing yourself in queues, but it is also convenient most of the time, and now once it was introduced we're simply spoiled. I couldn't really live without LFD (if I want to do a dungeon) since it's slow as hell to just fly to the instance portal, let alone find a group of people. I even go this far, that without the guild summoning perk, I wouldn't even bother going to raids - we're just lazy. Bottomline is, it is to late to remove LFD and Battleground queues. As for douche bags in LFD, I don't even listen, I just zone out and do my job and hope that it's over soon, not because of bad groups, you can finish any instance with a 3 guys AFK, but because dungeons get boring as hell. Altho they said they can't do it properly, they should really invest in procedural generated dungeons - at least then you get something new each dungeon. They could have some static dungeons like we have now and some procedural generated - would be a lot more fun seeing something &quot;new&quot; each time as to do the same old same old all the time.</div></div><hr />

The pandaren mount is still being finalized, so what you’ve heard (or seen) are just rumors at this point. Obviously we want the mount to be something awesome, which will take some time to perfect. In addition to the pandaren mount, expect to see a ton of new mounts in Mists of Pandaria. In fact, if any of the new creatures being added in the next expansion look up to the task, I’m sure the developers are looking for ways to throw a saddle on them so they can adventure through Azeroth with our heroes. Though I’m sure some are more comical looking than others. :P Anyway, once the information is ready, we’ll get it out to all of you. Trust! (Blue Tracker / Official Forums)<br />
<br />
Wait... wouldn't it be weird for bears to be riding mounts.... I mean it was oblivious that it would be weird for werewolves aka worgen to ride mounts. God<br />
blizzard is such a a mess its really its pathetic, but I'm sure blizzard will think of something more interesting than more horses, oh excuse me bareback horses, oh i know lets let the panderan ride bareback wolves thats new and fresh right.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I do understand that you don't want every class to have every option to choose between new cooldowns, spells, and dramatic passives but looking at the Shaman tree makes me rather play another class that I have less interest in making my main because their tree offers more exciting talents to look forward to in Mist.</div></div><hr />

I think it's quite the opposite, most guilds would rather be near the top on progress on their realm (even they may not be the fastest) as to jump to a realm where they will end up being in the top 200.<br />
<br />
Well, whatever the cause, servers are pretty much empty, aside a few which are close to overpopulated, and it's understandable. If you just look at AH prices on dead realms, you pay 1500G for leg armor as opposed to 350-500g on populated realms, 250g for a Greater Celestial Essence ~~~, I'd rather move to a realm where I don't spend 100k gold per week for basic stuff.</div></div><hr />

No, there's not. You only get that from using the LFD tool. Before LFD you had a daily to kill the end boss to get the highest tier emblem, now you queue up for a random LFD.</div></div><hr />

Ah well, 6 years is a long time to be playing one game. Canceled both my accounts last week...thought it would be hard, that I'd miss it...Other then the habit of checking the news/forums, hanging around with guildies on TS, life goes one without wow just fine. <br />

Actually that's true, not for every case, but it happens. When they launched the Brazilian servers, ppl flooded the server where most of the best guilds went (actually even the best guilds from each US server avaiable to transfer decided to chase each other on the same server, lol).<br />
<br />
Basically ppl that follow want to have guilds were they can join waiting for a &quot;free ride to epics&quot; and other guilds want to be able to get good players from each other.<br />

64bit: One big plus is the improved loading screen times; seconds instead of a half-minute to minute load times in the old 32bit.<br />
<br />
Humm... loading screen times are more like to be affected by faster HDs... unless you keep coming back and forth the same place like teleport to the same dungeon, teleport back to the place you were, then teleport back to the same dungeon... and only if you have enough ram for that. Even that way, at least the 1st time you load both places, they'll take as long as others.<br />
<br />
Anytime you're loading a new place, you'll start reading from your HD.<br />

People will bitch about anything won't they? Blizzard removes stupid requirements like seeing trainers, people complain. Really? REALLY? Removal of any pointless inconvenience is a good thing.<br />
<br />
Lol, arcade/fps player talking here, right? lol. In other games, they have trainers everywhere in those small towns. Even WoW used to have trainers in towns the size like goldshire (wich happens to show up in almost every questing map, there is always a decent town hub). Blizzard's fault deciding that everything should happen in Stormwind/Orgrimmar/Shattrat/Dalaran...<br />
<br />
Adds flavor to a game that isn't supposed to be a arcade/fps game.</div></div><hr />

1) make your own 5 man group<br />

3) join as a party ...<br />

switching to 64 bit MAC client gave me:<br />
3x faster logging on (loading into SW trade district)<br />
No lag in SW trade district (usually lagging a lot), although have not tested this at peak time yet as at work<br />
Approx increase in FPS by 10-15<br />
Graphics whilst flying around stormwind seemed much more fluid (no FPS spikes/drops)<br />
<br />
Into BGs: less lag, higher FPS, game seemed a lot more responsive<br />
<br />
No errors/crashes so far, addons working fine, but only tested for about 45 minutes before work.<br />
<br />
Also although I ran optomiser last night, this difference is between playing last night with 32 bit client and after using 64 bit client today = optomiser makes no difference</div></div><hr />

I've done it tons of times with my guild. We get 5 of us in a group, then use the LFD tool just so we get VP along with guild exp/rep.<br />

If you love flying to the instance yourself, just portal out once you're in and fly manually.<br />

I somewhat agree. While I wouldn't remove gems from the raid, I'd adjust their quality.<br />
<br />
Raid gems would be suitable for the content, and if you got one you'd want to use it.<br />
<br />
Crafted gems would be above-average for the content, and if you got one you'd even replace your raid gem for it.</div></div><hr />
