<br />
It might be the giant statue alluded to in the previous front page news post with the breakdown of the map. <br />
<br />
Almost all art of Sargeras features a giant burning beard. <br />
<br />
<br />
Why is gallywix flashing his penis in the bottom right panel?<br />
<br />
An unfortunate effect of sillohuete with his hand, it seems.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, I'm glad to see he's getting a proper model.<br />
<br />
Now Baine needs one so he can stop wearing that silly feather band and wear a proper headdress.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its not. Remember that the Tomb of Sargeras was built to house the remains of the Avatar of Sargeras. We're going to be fighting it, and that's it. Not Varian. Doesn't even look like Varian.</div></div><hr />

still waiting for this to be tuned....it's easy to run into mobs with 25million hp in just +10, thats 5 million damage over 4 seconds to the party?<br />
<br />
or +15 easily 60m hp mobs, thats 12 million over 4 seconds? any aoe'in of mobs is also a wipe.<br />

basically killing mobs on +10 is a wipe everytime? yeh no-one is doing mythic+ that week it's not difficult it's just boring to lose 400% of your maximum hp over 4 seconds for killing a mob.</div></div><hr />

No, 20% of the player's max health, not the mob's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
too much il'gynoth mythic, wow thats a joke then, doesn't even scale with difficulty, on harder mythics 10-15 you won't care most mobs can hurt you for much more than 20% of your hp, you won't be keeping them alive.<br />
<br />
my idea was much more crazy and scary, instead another affix thats just not volcanic so i don't care.<br />
<br />
the counter will probably be everyone running fighter chow, so as the mobs die you drop combat and food starts healing your ass so the healer doesn't have to constantly top the group after every pack.</div></div><hr />

So if you didn't start the exp. at the beginning you are fucked. One of my friend started the game in december. He doesn't even have the 35th trait... and most of my guild members are at 52+ <br />
That means -10% raw damage... He has only one legendary and it is a healing one. So we cannot inv him into our raid because he will fall back with -15% anyway on every fight (skill doesn't matter). <br />

<br />
Or realise the fact that they made it super easy to catch up and that everything is tuned without the 35+ traits or legendaries even factored into it. So the fact you keep someone with only 35 traits and 1 legendary out of your raiding guild just mean you guys are pseudo-elitists and must be pretty horrible if you need people to be that over geared to clear content<br />

Just speculation, but I think this is probably like the Mists of Pandaria bonus rep gain thing for alts. They mentioned at Blizzcon making it easier to catch up on some of these reputations like you could in MoP. Maybe Paragon rep = double reputation gains.</div></div><hr />

One of the worst things about transmog is that it literally does nothing ingame and people still somehow make it a scrub/elite thing. No one cares about what mogs you like and don't like, players are going to wear whatever they want and there's nothing you can do about it.</div></div><hr />

I kinda hope the mount variations aren't locked to the specs. Would be nice if we could just choose. I always go for the classic blue theme with my DK even though I don't play frost.<br />
<br />
there is 4 rogue and pali ones, so i doudt it<br />

<br />
It's a Titan Construct. So it could be a Vessel for Sageras, or it could just be a Fel Corrupted Titan creation.<br />

the thing with the massive horns? its the avatar of sargeras we know that... its allready been ffing said,... and its odvious<br />

- - - Updated - - -<br />

<br />
Yeah, I think the Avatar of Sargeras is Varian. Or his corpse, at any rate.<br />
<br />
uhh no its a giant titan creation like a statue, it is battle damaged from losing against aegwyn<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
I was almost convinced that the 'demonThing.jpg' was a corrupt Bolvar for a moment considering the look, if you look at it without the steroids and green stuff. Lich King being the creation of the Legion makes it entirely possible I think but story wise I doubt it.<br />
<br />

Nope. I use Tier 1, Tier 10 or Tier 15 on my Shaman. Except the Helm from Tier 1 because that just ruins it imo. I don't like the Skyshatter one personally.<br />

One of the worst things about transmog is that it literally does nothing ingame and people still somehow make it a scrub/elite thing. No one cares about what mogs you like and don't like, players are going to wear whatever they want and there's nothing you can do about it.<br />

It's the Avatar of Sargeras that Aegwynn fought ages ago. She sealed it inside the Tomb of Sargeras. That's why it's called the Tomb of Sargeras.<br />

Well, some people need SOME way to feel superior. The transmog hipsters are a laugh, best treat them as such seeing as how style and what looks good is entirely subjective. I've seen hipster transmogs that looked like something Tim Burton threw up... but, as long as they're happy with it, that's all fine and dandy! If they try to enforce their taste on others, that's just a waste of their own time.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like the PTR. If stabilty is something you're looking for, the PTR is not for you. I recall during testing in WOD, the'd break the garrisons and not fix them for a week at a time on the PTR. Especially the first couple of weeks, they're probably doing a bunch of under the hood stuff that will make the whole thing unstable. <br />
<br />
Again, if you're looking for stable and reliable, the PTR is not for you.</div></div><hr />

They arnt just texture updates. They are completely new models. New textures. The only thing that they share is the idea. And the general look. Look at the mythic hunter or druid and dare say &quot;its just a reskin of the t6 atmor&quot;<br />

it the same set, it looks way too similar to be considered as a new separate set. im a fanboi, just like you, not that much of slave it seems tho. <br />
<br />
tell me this, would you consider this, the same armor sets (mythic changing the helm and shoulder slots a bit and sticking on some 3d poopbits all over) done in todays standards OR whole new armor sets? even class hall sets could be considered less of a ripoff of the original CM armor sets. &gt;.&gt;</div></div><hr />

1. The challenger mode to class hall sets are no where near the same as this. Those where simply slightly altered. But more or less recolours with only the helm and shoulders bring somewhat different models<br />
2. I'm. Not saying these are original<br />
But other then the appearance of the old set. This set is 100% from fresh. No simply adjustments. No simple recolours. It has the exact same amount of work put into it then any brand new their set. Other then the concept art is done.</div></div><hr />

except your wrong, and hating just to hate it is 100% clear to anyone who isnt blinded by &quot;OH FUCK BLIZZ FUCK DEM DEY ZTUPID&quot;<br />
<br />
The class hall sets other then minor diferences on some peices like shoulders, helm, and belt, are recolours, hell the priest one is literally JUST a recolour, no difference<br />
<br />
these sets are 100% made from scrap, the only thing that was kept from the old sets is the appearance... the model, texture, and spell effects are all brand fucking new<br />

class hall, notice how the shoulders and helm are slightly different? the rest of the set is the EXACT SAME MODEL with different colours, that is a recolour... but aparently to you that took more effort then<br />

u can not be mistaken with anyone else on this forum &quot;CUZ OF UR L33T NERDZ TALK&quot;<br />

class hall sets atleast altered something u know? smaller horns, less weighty shoulders, etc.<br />
<br />
anyway, do you honestly consider these the NEW sets?<br />

yes they are made from ground up, but apart from monk, dk and dh, they are all copied exactly, adding some pointy bits instead of texture in some places.<br />

stand your old t6 in front of ya and remake it in todays standards, oh boy, that sure as hell takes creativity.<br />

the class hall sets were 80% the same set recoloured, and then the helm and shoulders slightly changed, some of them the belt slightly changed aswell, or for the priest just a right out recolour<br />
<br />
these sets were made from the ground up, new models, new textures, new 3d elementes andthe mythic versions add even more stuff ,upgrading the sets and making them look even cooler<br />
<br />
and who said the creativity mattered? every time they make a new set people complain to fucking hell, its nice to have updated versions of old sets people would/and do love to use, but dont/hate to because of how shitty they look these days<br />

Meh, as much as I am pissed at the tier 8 upgrade sets, idk..I feel kind of proud at the same time. Was about time some old sets that everyone loved got upgraded, and updated to new content. Hell, we all LOVED the old sets. Coming from tier 8, to tier 7, to tier 6, they're all old sets that deserve an upgrade. <br />
<br />
It makes WOW feel new, ya know. :)<br />
