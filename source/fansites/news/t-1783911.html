Warcraft Movie - Updated Preview of Orgrim<br />
Wired posted (http://www.wired.com/2015/05/warcraft-orgrim-reveal-exclusive/) an updated preview of Orgrim from the Warcraft movie this morning.

<br />
I saw the teaser trailer at Blizzcon last year and they indeed made the faces extremely expressive. It was stunning. Same motion capture technology they used for Gollum in LOTR, etc. But better. <br />
<br />
Can't say anything about the rest of the movie, but it'll at least LOOK good!</div></div><hr />

<br />
That doesn't even make any sense, why should people be limited to seeing only one movie per year? Can quite easily see the &quot;other huge films&quot; and see this one too.<br />
<br />
If there is a reason it's not going be successful, it's definitely not that, it'll be because not enough people know about the background/warcraft in general and will label it &quot;just another crappy fantasy film&quot;. Thing is Blizzard will have anticipated this, they know it's not going to be a worldwide record breaker, they are doing this for their fans and to generate more interest in their games from other sources.</div></div><hr />

He's just being realistic and I share his sentiment. Movie adaptations of video games have had a poor trend in film history. They tend to flop.<br />
<br />
I am a bit optimistic about Warcraft though considering how vast and deep the lore is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard wanted the Comic-Con teaser from two years ago to be public. Comic-Con didn't. Blizzard wanted last Blizzcon's teaser to be public. Universal didn't.<br />
<br />
The first official public trailer is supposed to be released with Jurassic World, about a month from now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Generally trailers are released within the 6 months coming up to the release of the movie. I'd say probably expect it around Dec/Jan.</div></div><hr />

Orcs are green because of fel corruption, not the demon blood. Stated in the Rise of the Horde book :&gt;<br />

To be fair, none of those had a good cast, director, CGI team or source material (story-wise). This time, everyone wants to get it right, and they have everything they need for it. It's more of a book adaptation than a game adaptation, and the plot is simple enough for them to build their own cinematographic lore around it.</div></div><hr />

Demon blood makes them even greener. Orgrim never drank, so he's less green than others.<br />
<br />
Since he's a Blackrock he'd most likely be Grey-green.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only the resident evil movies have been a moderate success. The rest failed miserably and barely made any money. You can't just look at Wikipedia numbers either. A 100m budget for 200m profit is considered a flop.</div></div><hr />

There should be a teaser/trailer out soon since a game movie really needs to get there marketing up for the world wide community to get into a game movie to go see it.<br />
This movie will be the key for alot of game movies if its good if it becomes a flop we can wait again for another 5-10 years to see a big budget game movie being made.</div></div><hr />

<br />
*sigh* For the billionth time, it's not up to Blizzard, it's up to Legendary. Why would Blizzard not want to show the trailer, exactly? Maybe they're just waiting for people to stop constantly being angry pissants. Or it could just be to annoy you, and only you.<br />
<br />
<br />
You mean Blackhand i think.<br />

<br />
Nope, he means Ogrim. The Black Plate and Doomhammer that Thrall now wears were Ogrim Doomhammers before they were Thralls. Ogrim was also still wearing the Black Plate in WoDs timeline too.<br />
<br />

<br />
I'm pretty sure he'll wear it though, it would be fuckin' wierd if he didn't, though I find it strange that they didn't release one of him in the Black Plate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After seeing this, this has improved my impressions over this movie greatly :D<br />
<br />
Though I'm going to have to read up on Warcraft lore, (sadly I never played coz I was too little please don't hate me) so that I can understand the characters and stuff more :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fantastic, because you probably couldn't make orcs more realistic even if you created them via genetic science. Yet, I withhold my final judgement for when I've seen them talk, move and fight.<br />
<br />
Worrying because as you noticed he is grey/brown and not wearing his famous breastplate. This could be because it is a flashback or the story goes back to before the war against the Draenei or early in it. I would say it is the former, as Blizzard probably focusses on the war of the Horde against the Kingdom of Azeroth. The breastplate could just be laid off for the evening, as even orcs don't need to be wear their armour 24 a day. Yet, at worst these could be signs of Blizzard abandoning some of the major parts of the lore in Warcraft.<br />
<br />

The Orcs only become green-skinned after drinking the demon's blood (And their children born after I believe). Those that refused will remain brown skinned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh heh, you'll likely end up with a more complete knowledge of the characters reading about them than you will having played WC 1 +2 (you should totally play WC3 though), WC 1 + 2 were great, great games, but characters aren't really fleshed out all that much, especially in WC 1. THere's also been a bit of revisionism since then too.</div></div><hr />

Think of it as how Marvel doesn't copy the comics 100% ( Thor would probably beat all the other Avengers together in the comics ).<br />
<br />
Don't hype up expecting it to be 100% Warcraft 1 because it won't be.<br />
<br />
There will be changes. The movie mentions The Alliance as existing ( in canon lore it was created in Year 5/6, during the Second War ), Dalaran is up in the skies and Lothar is much younger. Don't mistake it as a movie for the fans, it's a movie for the masses and is meant to attract them towards the Warcraft universe ( which is why Dalaran is up and the Alliance exists, so it's easy for them to link the game and the movie. The good orcs will also be brown, rather than green. )<br />
<br />
That being said it's going to be awesome and I'll try not to let negativity get the best of me. It looks amazing so far.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This movie literally takes place before and during the first war. They wouldn't be green yet since they have yet to drink the blood and get all fel corrupted. That is of course assuming that this shot shows him before they drink the blood.<br />

If they think brown will work better for a movie because otherwise we got 1000x a hulk on the screen then i would say let the hole turning green theme lose. (you can always work with the eyes turning red ect) <br />
If the Battle armor looks not realistic on the character in the CGI movie then let it go and make new armor. (you still have doomhammer)<br />

I'm not really sure that it's really anything to do with it &quot;Working better for a movie&quot; or even slightly related to the Hulk.<br />
Orgrim Doomhammer is not green in the image, because he isn't green in the story. It's really as simple as that and the same applies to the armour.<br />
The Orcs that drank the blood of Mannoroth are green. The orcs that did not are brown/red/terracotta however you wanna define it. This is why Garrosh is not green, it's why Grom has been depicted as both green and brown depending on where in the timeline you meet him in regards to if he has, or has not drank the blood of Mannoroth. (Doomhammer never drank the blood at any point.)<br />
<br />

<br />
Also, Doomhammer without his iconic black plate armour. IE, he didn't always have it.<br />

<br />
1) The previous version showed Ogrim as green, even though the lighting made him look a little brown, still green.<br />
<br />
2) The still above could be from when they're in Draenor and before they drink Mannoroth's blood, hence why he's still brown. (Edit: He didn't even drink the blood in the lore, so he's brown anyways)<br />
<br />
3) If ^ is the case, then he doesn't have his iconic armor and will obtain it in the movie.<br />
<br />
<br />
Guys, they know the story, we know the story, it's all good. Ogrim is going to be green. This whole &quot;Good Orcs are Brown, Evil Orcs are Green&quot; or &quot;Brown may work better&quot; nonsense is well simply nonsense. The movie is going to tell the story from 2 perspectives, and they're probably gonna show how it all started for the Orcs using flashbacks or just show the beginning and move forward. Stop freaking out, it's one picture from a movie that we know and don't know everything about.</div></div><hr />

I actually have good hopes for this movie. the impression I got from blizzcon panel is that those guys actually give a shit. which might make all the difference.<br />

The Frostwolf Clan refused to drink the Blood of Mannoroth, but their skin still turned green. These shots could easily be of an Orgrim before said event occurring, or else they just chose to keep him brown (perhaps for contrast).</div></div><hr />

Time will tell whether the movie itself is a flop or not. Given the frequency that video game licensed movies bomb, I am not getting my hopes up.<br />

I am a bit optimistic about Warcraft though considering how vast and deep the lore is.<br />
<br />
well if anyone cared to look at who is involved in this film u could tell that it is nothing like the other VGM adaptations. from the directors to ILM to the actors casted. also having a rich deep lore is not gonna be the reason why the movie is good. tons of VGM adaptation has rich deep lore. This movie will be good if the script is good, the dialogue is good, and the acting is good. Just like any other movie.</div></div><hr />

Think of it like the marvel comics. <br />
<br />
It's based on the first war from the game and the novels but it's kinda like a different universe. Hence the flying Dalaran and all that other stuff.</div></div><hr />

Lets face it some things work in a game others work better in a movie.<br />
They should take things from the game that they think will work and change/remove plots that they think will not work.<br />

<br />
Draka is pregnant with Thrall by what it seems the end more or less. If what I saw at Blizzcon is any indication, but he won't be in the movie.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then how will they explain Thrall being Green?<br />
<br />
Everyone will be 'green' at some point during the movie, the frostwolfs will take the longest to change due to being exiled and not drinking the Blood. But remember that everyone turned green even without drinking the blood.</div></div><hr />

After they drank the demon blood.<br />
<br />
The movie includes scenes taking place before the Dark Portal was built, when the orcs still had brown skin.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It's cool and all that, but are they going to keep the story cannon?<br />
They've already said that the movies will have their own continuity, like the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which means that they're going to diverge from the canon in some parts of the story.<br />
<br />

There won't be any plot twists lol. Unless they don't plan on making a Warcraft 2 movie based on the second game.<br />
<br />
i meant the idea that only people who drank the blood is green and not the fel magic thing that is cannon. You know that they won't adapt everything 100% right?</div></div><hr />

After they drank the demon blood.<br />

The movie includes scenes taking place before the Dark Portal was built, when the orcs still had brown skin.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
They've already said that the movies will have their own continuity, like the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which means that they're going to diverge from the canon in some parts of the story.<br />

That's because they were quarantined. They had a plague like disease. The Warlocks didn't go there 'cuz they wanted to avoid the plague. It's why Nagrand is so uncorrupted compared to say Hellfire or Shadowmoon.</div></div><hr />

It's inconceivable that Warcraft could ever do worse than Clash of the Titans. Absolute worst case scenario, it's a heartless CGI spectacle, which is what Clash was. However, everyone involved in Warcraft is way more talented and more passionate than that film's crew, and it's got a built in fanbase that will turn out to see it.<br />

Intelligent/hive-minded zombies with shiny light blue eyes in an extremely cold enviroment kind of are. Although I guess the Scourge has a lot more going for them, with abominations, zombie dragons and nerubians...</div></div><hr />

The glowing blue eyes and snowy environments for all the Scourge stuff were definitely inspired by A Song of Ice and Fire. In WC2 the death knights and undead didn't have any ice-based powers at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most of the game is inspired by other things. Now that they've run out of those inspirations things have taken a turn for the worse... I guess we'll see how this derivative movie does. I'm just not hopeful, even with graphics done by the same team that does the Avengers. I've already seen their amazing work and while it does aid in storytelling, you still have to tell that story. And 2-2.5 hours of split between horde and alliance establishing characters and story that most people are unfamiliar with doesn't instill confidence. I honestly think people will go see Age of Apocalypse if they have to choose between the two(and they will with Warcraft the week after X-Men). Especially with the shots I've seen that make people my age go all fuzzy with nostalgia for the cartoon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but the decision to make a second one didn't come from what it made on the opening weekend.<br />
Clash had a Budget of $125,000,000 and it's end gross domestic was: $191,204,754<br />
<br />
International Box Office pulled another $293,800,000	for a grand total Worldwide Box Office of: 485,004,754	<br />
<br />
Thats what got it a sequel not what it did on opening. (sourcehttp://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-Turtles-(2014)#tab=box-office )<br />
<br />
<br />
It's inconceivable that Warcraft could ever do worse than Clash of the Titans. Absolute worst case scenario, it's a heartless CGI spectacle, which is what Clash was. <br />
<br />
I disagree. This is another video game turned movie and all the best hopes in the world wont save it from that genera and how the majority of those do.<br />
<br />
Will this movie be one of the few exceptions? You sure as hell cannot tell from 2 CGI stills alone.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
While the first 2 movies you mentioned are indeed not competition. TMNT 2 will be. It grossed 65M in it's opening weekend and I don't expect a game to movie to do better than that no matter how loyal a fan base it has. Even with it dropping 57% in it's second weekend, grossing 28M, it will be competition for a video game turned movie like wow.<br />
<br />
I'd wager more know about TMNT for as long as they have been around and for how good the first movie did overall vs the ones that will go see a WOW movie and less of the population knows about. If you take the 28M out of the second weekend gross TMNT had, its going to hurt anything WOW could hope to grasp. (that is of course if either of them are worth a damn)</div></div><hr />

The books lore &gt; the game lore imo.<br />

Demon Blood contains Fel Energy. Thats why they had to drink the blood of a pit lord. It contains some of the most powerful energy. That way the change in the orcs would be quicker.</div></div><hr />

So you're arguing that not that many people know WoW, yet everybody will know it's a 'videogame movie'? For most people, this will just be another Lord of the Rings/Hobbit thing, and they'll see the trailer, they'll see pretty CGI, and they'll go watch the movie.<br />
<br />
<br />
We're not going to agree on that either.<br />
<br />
Why? The director is good, his two previous movies show the kind of potential you only see with guys like Christopher Nolan, and he knows the source material. The cast is good, maybe not Hollywood superstars, but not B-movie level by any stretch. A few of them are players, too. The CGI team is one of the best in the world, and their director is also a fan of the series. Talent? Check. Passion? Check.<br />
<br />
Even the composser is known for pretty amazing stuff like Game of Thrones or Pacific Rim.</div></div><hr />

Not a chance in hell will it be the same comparrion or popularity. LoTR's and it's material has been around for way to long. WOW is nothing more than a game turned movie. Will it be one of the better ones? Maybe, but 2 Average CGI still doesn't scream amazing.<br />

Why? The director is good, his two previous movies show the kind of potential you only see with guys like Christopher Nolan, and he knows the source material. <br />

I don't think they are viewed the same. Anything and everything can happen in comics. It has and has been done for years with some minor backlash but nothing ever devastating.<br />
<br />
Game to movies don't seem to have that resilience similar to some book to movies. Change to much and fans go ape $h!t. It's a fine line they will have to walk here. If they go to far I just don't think a fans will be all that grateful. <br />

You put a lot of weight into your opinion. No way this film doesn't open to ~65 million or more. The advertising blitz will ensure that. The fan base is not comprised of bitter internet trolls either, if you honestly think MASSES of fans are not going to swarm the movies to see this, you are just plain touched in the head.<br />
<br />
Will the movie be any good? Shit I dont know, not a whole lot to go on at this point. Will it flop? lol no chance in hell. It will be a profitable movie.<br />

<br />
Yeah, not deep and complex, but I know enough to know that Orcs aren't the only race in the Warcraft universe. I'd much rather see a game-turned-movie have a nice, fair-share of screen time for multiple races, such as Dwarves, Night Elves, High Elves, Trolls, Tauren, hell even some Gnomes would be great. If I wanted to go see a huge battle with Orcs and Humans fighting, along with some Dwarves and Elves, I'd watch a LotR/Hobbit movie. Not a game-turned-movie.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gadzooks</div><div class="date">2015-05-18, 08:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Impressive CGI. I'd like to see it in action, I'm glad to see they got the tusks to work out. The tusk thing has always amused me - if orcs were real, they wouldn't be able to speak as clearly as they do in the game, because the lower lip would be constrained by being wrapped around those huge teeth - try it, pull your lower lip out and try to talk - you can do it, but it would effect how they talk. Had a long BS session about it once on vent in a raid back in TBC. If Orcs really had tusks, they'd use them as weapons, because animals that have them, like boars or hippos, use them to slash and stab with - how freaking badass would it be to show an Orc fighting someone, parry a sword thrust, yank the opponent, in, and then slash his jugular with his tusks? Highly doubt that will ever happen in the movie. They'd also be pretty much constantly drooling. They'd never be invited to fancy parties at the Alliance Embassy, because if they drank wine from a goblet the'd spill half of it all over themselves or the table, and eating would be stomach turning to watch. <br />
<br />
Yeah, we used to get really bored in raids, waiting for everyone to get there, lol. We used to argue about stuff like that for hours.</div></div><hr />

Think of it as how Marvel doesn't copy the comics 100% ( Thor would probably beat all the other Avengers together in the comics ).<br />
<br />
Don't hype up expecting it to be 100% Warcraft 1 because it won't be.<br />
<br />
There will be changes. The movie mentions The Alliance as existing ( in canon lore it was created in Year 5/6, during the Second War ), Dalaran is up in the skies and Lothar is much younger. Don't mistake it as a movie for the fans, it's a movie for the masses and is meant to attract them towards the Warcraft universe ( which is why Dalaran is up and the Alliance exists, so it's easy for them to link the game and the movie. The good orcs will also be brown, rather than green. )<br />
<br />
That being said it's going to be awesome and I'll try not to let negativity get the best of me. It looks amazing so far.<br />
<br />
It's also just as well that they make those changes, since it would make the plot more complicated down the line if they made sequels/prequels. Having to explain why Dalaran floats and other things the games and books fleshed out would cram the movie full of unnecessary exposition. As long as the characters are fleshed out properly and the movie does not commit any major sins towards established WarCraft canon, I'll be fine. At least they have quite a lot of room to make changes and expand the story considering how flimsy the first WarCraft game was in terms of story.<br />

The movie is about the First War. The races we'll likely see are Orcs (maybe Ogres and Forest Trolls), Humans (maybe Dwarves and Gnomes), and High Elves. Unless they make a War of the Ancients movie I doubt we'll see Night Elves any time soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fans will see it. Don't kid yourself. Not that their opinion matters anyway, they're a drop in the bucket when it comes to a mass-market release. Adaptations of any sort typically start with the audience knowing nothing about the source material. A film's success is typically determined by marketing and, to a lesser extent, a film's quality.<br />
<br />
And your opinion regarding games to films is...flawed. Video games being adapted to film has never been done seriously...ever. Go through the list. B-movie talent, B-movie budgets. This is the most serious attempt at adapting a game into a movie that has ever been done. The only attempt that can even be put in the same category in terms of a serious attempt was Final Fantasy: The Spirit Within. And in that case, while a serious attempt was made, it was a serious attempt with individuals who lacked the pedigree to create a blockbuster film.<br />
<br />
Regardless of your opinion, the individuals making this film have taken this venture very seriously. It cannot be compared with the previous game-to-movie ventures, because it has nothing in common with them. I don't know why it's taken so many years for a studio to put forward a serious attempt, but it's never been any mystery why previous attempts at video game film adaptations have failed. It certainly has nothing to do with the fact that they're based on video games. So please, put aside that point of cynicism, as it has no basis in reality.<br />

Could it still fail? Of course it could. But not because it's based on a video game.</div></div><hr />

Jesus Christ, dude, the word is &quot;genre.&quot; How is anyone supposed to take your opinion seriously?<br />

And &quot;adapted from a video game&quot; is not a genre. FFS, that's like saying Lord of the Rings and The Great Gatsby are in the same genre.<br />
<br />
And it doesn't matter that other video games were adapted poorly. The vast majority of video game adaptations so far have been cheap, poorly executed cash grabs, mostly directed by Uwe Boll who was only doing them to take advantage of a tax loophole in Germany to make more money.<br />
<br />
The fact is that you could say the same thing about comic book adaptations 13 years ago, before Spider-man came out and broke box office records. Now Hollywood is releasing like 10 comic book adaptations a year, making billions of dollars.<br />

There's no telling if Warcraft will be the first succesful video game adaptation, but they've certainly got the studio support, funding, and crew to make it happen.

I watched that movie and enjoyed it, then found it was based on a computer game. There's your problem.<br />
<br />
It would be better if Blizzard just didn't use wow in the title. Wow players are going to know about it anyway, but putting the name in the title is just asking for piss-poor movie reviewers to make lazy allusions to South Park and the Simpsons without watching it properly.<br />
<br />
Try telling friends who know nothing about wow the lore of, say, Arthas. If they enjoy stories they'll generally like it and be quite surprised when you tell them its a video game. You get this reaction particulary off women who won't touch the game.</div></div><hr />

I doubt it's something you'd want to be wearing all the time. Maybe he wears leather armor for hunting, and plate armor in battle.<br />
<br />
Or maybe his armor hasn't even been forged yet at this point. He's not green yet, so this has to be some time before the invasion.</div></div><hr />

So I have a big issue with the hair. Orcs don't have body hair, Thrall having eyebrows being the one and only exception. And yes eyebrows are technically body hair. But they gave Orgrim eyebrows and chest hair, and the facial hair looks like glued on scraps from a barbershop floor.<br />
<br />
Ditch the chest hair and eyebrows, and make it so it doesn't look like he has a 70's porn star's balls sack glued on his face and it will be perfect. Not saying the facial hair has to go, it just needs to not look like shit.</div></div><hr />

There not the same subject but they are books made into movies. One doing much better than the other I might add. However, game to movies are not historically known to do great. There are a few but everyone met with skepticism. There just not normally that good and even ones that are still running like REsident Evil are more because they can be made for a relatively cheap price and profit margins are high. It's not because the stories are that great thats for sure.<br />

somewhat true but what makes you think a warcraft movie will be different. 2 CGI screen shots and your sold? I think you are just a bit too hopeful?<br />
<br />
<br />
The fact is that you could say the same thing about comic book adaptations 13 years ago, before Spider-man came out and broke box office records. Now Hollywood is releasing like 10 comic book adaptations a year, making billions of dollars.<br />
<br />
and until I'm proven wrong, I'll stick with what I know. Video games to movies do not in general do all that well and blizzard will have to do more than show some average CGI screenshot for todays standards to impress.<br />
<br />
<br />
There's no telling if Warcraft will be the first succesful video game adaptation, but they've certainly got the studio support, funding, and crew to make it happen. Which is more than can be said for pretty much every other adaptation, with the possible exception of Prince of Persia.<br />
<br />
as far as Prince of Persia goes, it was a flop in the states. Thank goodness for international markets. Maybe thats what blizzard is banking on. International sales. PoP cost nearly $200M to make and it made $90,759,680 in the states. If it wasn't for the international market PoP would have been an epic flop and was considered so in the starts Now that I'm looking at the numbers, I'm really thinking a Warcraft movie will only do average in the states but kill it in Asian markets where wow is a bit bigger. <br />
<br />
But you are right, there is no way to know if it will be successful just yet. Not enough information on the movie but given past video game to movie adaptions. I'm starting out with no hope and working up from there as needed. That way, it will be hard to be disappointed.<br />
<br />
The movie will have to be really impressive, not stray to far from the lore that the fan base really knows and like and still offer more than just CGI.</div></div><hr />

Yeah...so I'm lost on how to respond to your comment. So if the 2/3 of the audience that was intended to see it and who did see it - didn't see it...then it would have been a flop?<br />
<br />
So are you thinking movie makers make movies thinking only people in the U.S. will watch them? So you don't think movie makers figure there will be a few other viewers among the worlds other 95% of the people on this planet?

I think it's safe to assume that there's some time before the orcs invade <br />
where we'll see some of them brown. That, or the Frostwolves (who he's <br />
with in the movie-verse) don't turn green. (yet)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kinda, but not really. (though truth be told, Thrall shouldn't be &quot;spring green&quot; either. Orgrim (and Thrall's parents) didn't drink Mannoroth's blood. So they had some hues of green about them due to the Warlocks screwing around with fel magic, but he wouldn't have been bright green like most.</div></div><hr />

Yeah...so I'm lost on how to respond to your comment. So if the 2/3 of the audience that was intended to see it and who did see it - didn't see it...then it would have been a flop?<br />
<br />
So are you thinking movie makers make movies thinking only people in the U.S. will watch them? So you don't think movie makers figure there will be a few other viewers among the worlds other 95% of the people on this planet? I just find it interesting that 5% of the world population made up for 1/2 of movie cost and you call it a bust noting that only the other 95% of the world's population made up for it.<br />

The Orcs turned green years before the first war, so unless it's in a flash back, we won't see it.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, he looks pretty brown-ish but I dunno. I instantly thought flashbacks. I can imagine some good ones. Humans are pretty simple but we could keep on getting more and more information on why the Orcs are in this situation. Maybe they look &quot;evil&quot; at the beginning but as time goes on you get to see more and more that their choices aren't as black and white as the general audience of non-players would think &quot;Orcs&quot; are.</div></div><hr />

Mortal Kombat wasn't just successful for a videogame movie it was successful period. Back in the nineties it burst into cinemas with amazing action, some pretty big stars, decent enough acting (for the material) a decent plot (amazing considering the source material), cool effects and an awesome soundtrack. It was like a yard stick in the 90's, if you hadn't seen MK you were not cool.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just watched it the other day on Netflix...it hasn't aged well, lol.<br />
<br />
It was successful yes, but the thing lacking MK was the fatalities, because let's be honest; MK was about blood and gore, the movie just gives the illusion something's going on, while you don't see anything. I guess it has something to do with rating, but it kinda bummed me out. Also it wasn't how I remembered it at all, so I guess it was impressive at the time.</div></div><hr />

Then there's the thing with the Frostwolf emblem stamped on the Doomhammer which Duncan Jones apparently says is intended. They might end up making him Durotan's brother, or clan member just to make their bromance easier to explain. Sad really, the only reason their friendship was so significant is because they belonged to different clans, as it was well known that orcs of different clans didn't necessarily get along that well.<br />

I somehow get the feeling that the movie will end up having minor differences here and there (such as flying Dalaran) that will cause a huge uproar in the community.</div></div><hr />

I know the series will have changes. I know I will dislike quite a few. Regradles, I felt the same way about LotR, and it's still one of the greatest fantasy movies ever made. Call me suckered in, but having read a couple of interviews from Rob Kazinsky and seeing the movie panel, I just can't contain my hype. Warcraft could be a thing. The possibility is there! *squee*<br />
<br />
Slightly OT: There's something about Kazinsky that I just can't hate or be cynical about. He's a fan made manifest and his joy is like a disease: Infectious and probably not good for you. :D</div></div><hr />

No that's just the old Doomplate model they made for Thrall back in vanilla. The vanilla one was supposed to resemble what he wore in Warcraft 3. They just never updated the model for Orgrim hence why it looks like crap :P</div></div><hr />

That is CGI. ILM is doing the Orcs. He looks amazing and ILM supposedly developed a new technique for the Orcs, but the real test is how they move. Which the wider public hasn't gotten to see yet.</div></div><hr />
