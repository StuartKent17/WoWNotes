<br />
No, sorry but your point is wrong. A parody singer is extremely unusual and it's very much tailored to a specific audience. While Linkin Park and Metallica are Hard Rock they are extremely mainstream and while they're people who probably don't care for them, they grab a wider audience than Al. Weird Al is out of date by like 20 years now, he hasn't done anything remotely current that is good, great for an older crowd, not so good for a younger crowd.<br />
<br />
These are facts. <br />
<br />
I liked Al as a kid but I'd rather leave him there.</div></div><hr />

Weird Al is fun and I'm willing to wager most Blizzard fans enjoy his work. I think it is a fantastic choice. This may have sold the ticket for me.. wasn't planning on it but sounds fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard is all about parodies in their game, and as far as blizzard products go, Weird Al is a great fit.<br />
<br />
I think a lot of people want these big named bands, but we have to keep in mind Blizzard likely sends several invites and the one that returns the call is likely the winner. <br />
<br />
With each game blizzard makes having a very similar since of humor to Weird Al, it is a solid fit. <br />
<br />
I think a lot of people are lost to the fact that the people who make the games are picking the artists so is likely going to be something that blends well with they are doing.<br />
<br />
The big benefit is Weird Al is actually and accomplished song writer, strange though he sings only mostly parodies. Weird Al is not as costly and maybe able to make tailored songs for blizzard which is something that may appeal to blizzard as since the E.T.C they haven't really had blizzard game tailored songs.<br />
<br />
Either way flame him or Blizzard is silly as its a great fit for both of them, and we will never really know if it is good or bad till the concert is over.</div></div><hr />

A parody singer is extremely unusual and it's very much tailored to a specific audience. While Linkin Park and Metallica are Hard Rock they are extremely mainstream and while they're people who probably don't care for them, they grab a wider audience than Al. Weird Al is out of date by like 20 years now, he hasn't done anything remotely current that is good, great for an older crowd, not so good for a younger crowd.<br />
<br />
These are facts. <br />
<br />
I liked Al as a kid but I'd rather leave him there.<br />
<br />
Urgh, I hate to be that guy (I don't actually), but Linkin Park is Alt. Nu Metal and Metallica are classic heavy metal. Not hard rock.</div></div><hr />

As a metal fan, this is a better choice than most of the BS they've brought out before who didn't give a shit they were playing a video game convention. This will be up there with the D as one of the better shows.</div></div><hr />

Look at it this way, he will be hitting across so many genres of music, it will make your head spin. Weird Al is actually doing the best thing possible to keep relevant, with how pop culture moves so much more rapidly now. He finished his last album, Mandatory Fun (which, might I add, all the videos were done not through the label he was with, but through different social media sites that got early exclusivity to the one they helped with), he is now going to a digital-release medium, so he can hit one song here or there when the subject matter arises, to keep on top of pop culture and reference.<br />

The Metallica s/t didn't come out till '91, and that's when they achieved huge mainstream success. From Kill 'em All through Ride the Lightening they were on independent record labels. Their first big hit and major record release Master of Puppets received virtually no radio play and had no music videos.

I can ofcourse be wrong since I don't follow album charts and thus don't know how high soundtracks usually goes, but IF the Suicide Squad album is higher than other soundtracks I would guess that it is because &quot;heathens&quot; is on it. <br />
<br />
And while I personally like the track itself I don't think it's the quality of the track that is the important part, but rather the artists behind it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nah, I'm just pointing out that they pretty much only stick to what is considered &quot;alternative to popular music&quot; from 2005. Would it kill them to bring a more recent artist? You do know there is more to modern music than pop artists?</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be fair I can understand the legendary argument if it's that godawful ring.<br />
<br />
Also to the people saying he's a nobody what have you done in the past 20 years that's relevant or won 4 Grammies, a spot in the Billboard top 10 and platinum and gold records? One of them being last year actually in terms of the Grammy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On topic: Weird Al was great when I was growing up and seeing Blizzard mixing it up once in a while is great. <br />
<br />
Personally out of the 6 BlizzCons I've watched, only 3 of the artists are ones I actually cared for; Tenacious D, Ozzy and Metallica. The rest of the bands did not interest me one bit, they're actually literal trash to me, but that's fine, people can have opinions and Blizzard choosing them was a-okay by me even when I didn't like them. I can just not watch them perform.</div></div><hr />

Weird Al is still making content and doing quite well. So just because *you* aren't aware doesn't make him not relevant silly narcissists.<br />

Amen! He's a great vocalist, musician and writer surrounded by his likes. He's made plenty of songs that, with a different text, could've hit it big on charts due to their melody. I listen regularly to &quot;The Saga Begins&quot;, the lyrics are amazing... and I don't even like Star Wars! <br />

He sticks with what he loves doing, and that's something to respect. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyclone Duke</div><div class="date">2016-10-28, 01:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wierd Al has always been - decade after decade - current/relevant, successful, funny, and a good listen to 9/10 times so long as you don't [make a point of hating his music because of what his music is]. Just like how the public perception of people who play WoW are basement dwelling shut-ins and tie negativity to that group of people because of the stigma - don't do the same yourself to Wierd Al. <br />
Yes, his music is not typical pop / rock - and he's mostly known for parodies. But they are GOOD parodies. He does a marvellous job - in his musical recreation, his video creations, and his personality, to make a fantastically fun and enjoyable act. <br />
<br />
Check his music videos - Fat, The Saga Begins, White &amp; Nerdy, just to name some off my head. They are fantastic examples of musical parody - perhaps you may not love what the genre is - but for what it is, it is very well done. So long as you don't have a stick up your ass then I recommend &quot;When in Rome, do as the Romans do&quot;. Just enjoy it as it is - let go of any stigma &quot;defaulted&quot; into your mind - and I'm sure anyone could have a great time with Al, at blizzcon, surrounded by people having a good time and up for some laughs and cheers!<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
Finally - In part, as you can see, decade after decade - Wierld Al is in-tune and in-touch with the world, and the geeky people! His lyrics about geeky-topics, is fantastic and you know he's genuine in all the jokes he makes. He's like us! He is a perfect fit, and hell I think he'd do a great job hosting the whole event probably haha!</div></div><hr />

To each his own man. I happened to enjoy them quite a bit (they actually kind of turned me into a fan based on that performance) and would put blink-182 dead last by a wide margin. I think the crowd was quite into it as well. <br />
<br />
You are also grading them against a pretty high bar; Foo Fighters, Tenacious D, Metallica, Offspring all had fantastic performances and even Video Games Live is at least enjoyable for the artistry and nostalgia, despite it not exactly being a show you can get crazy at.</div></div><hr />
