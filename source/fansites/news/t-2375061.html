Brawl - Tarren Mill vs. Southshore<br />
Originally introduced as a part of the World of Warcraft 10-Year Anniversary event, this Brawl harkens back to the early days of WoW PvP, with an epic battle between the two towns of Tarren Mill and Southshore. In this game of war, you’ll need to work as a team and deplete your foes’ resources to claim victory.</div></div><hr />

Same as it is every year. You have to buy the game twice. If you pre-purchase now to play the new races, then later get CE and add it to your account they refund you the license, but no money. So you will have an extra BfA license you can either sell, give to a friend, or add to another account.</div></div><hr />

The character panel still shows the old face while in the dressing room you can see the new. <br />
I hate the new one!<br />

Don't get your hopes up on that front. =/<br />
<br />
(I mean, sure they'll eventually have to speak up on the matter. Just be prepared to be disappointed yet again.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
In WoD they refunded the difference between the CE and the one you bought. They should do that every time. I guess the issue is that they don't actually sell the CE and it all becomes too much work to sort the refunds.</div></div><hr />
