Raid Testing Schedule - August 28<br />
On Wednesday, August 28, we will continue testing raid encounters in the Siege of Orgrimmar raid. <br />
<br />
Each encounter should be available at approximately the listed times below for all Public Test Realms.<br />
<br />
Wednesday, August 28<br />
<br />
Sha of Pride - 25 Player Heroic - 10:30 PDT (13:30 EDT, 19:30 CEST)<br />
Malkorok - 25 Player Heroic - 13:30 PDT (16:30 EDT, 22:30 CEST)<br />
<br />
<br />
As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a beta environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the boss being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br />

Item Level Squish<br />
Fair enough. How about we compromise and still do the squish, but - hear me out - but allow you to still do 100% of your damage?<br />
<br />
Is there a technical reason for a squish or is it just because some developers don't like big numbers?<br />
I hear that it's actually approaching some database integer limitation, but I don't know anything about it so I couldn't offer much insight. Aside from that though if I do 183468312 damage or 18346831 those numbers are just difficult to tell apart during combat.

<br />
Reducing Ability Bloat<br />
Reducing ability bloat is something that's been talked about fairly recently in interviews and tweeters, it's also something we've attempted to address as recently as this expansion. It's a balance, of course, between having depth of complexity through abilities without making the complexity just a ton of different buttons to push. There's also perception issues of taking away abilities, even if they're never used, as undermining the viability or versatility of a class. Classes are largely defined by their abilities, so taking things away can be a touchy subject. It's something that we will need to give another go at addressing, because classes getting new abilities as level caps raise is essentially a given. In any case we tend to save these kinds of big sweeping changes for expansions.<br />
<br />
STOP DUMBING DOWN THE GAME.<br />
Having tons of different buttons to push doesn't make you smart or good at the game. Having fewer buttons doesn't make you dumb or worse at the game. A literal comparison of # of abilities to # of abilities is not a valid comparison for depth of play or complexity that a skillful player can use.<br />
<br />
If you have 30 buttons and your rotation is to push each button in order from 1-&gt;30, is that a smart game? Can you as a skillful and smart player press those buttons from 1-&gt;30 better than a worse player? Now what about if you have 5 buttons that require situational awareness, combo off each other, and a skilled player can achieve let's say a ~10% DPS gain over someone else using those same 5 buttons just by making smart decisions of when to press them.<br />
<br />
What's your opinion now on what number of abilities means to making combat complex, smart, or skillful? Do fewer skills actually mean a &quot;dumber&quot; game? Does more of something just seem better? Is context of mechanics/gameplay/skill trumped by counting how many of something there is?

World of Warcraft and Nostalgia<br />
Have you ever considered that some people may have genuinely enjoyed vanilla? <br />
I have no doubt that there are people out there who remember Vanilla World of Warcraft for how it really was, who can list all Vanilla gameplay systems and features in exact detail, and who still prefer the game as it was back then despite all the progress and additions that have happened since. These people would certainly enjoy playing the Vanilla game if they could, and I can understand if it is frustrating for these people to be placed into the same group as those people who actually are nostalgic.<br />
<br />
The thing is though, that there are a lot more people who are nostalgic than people who are not. Those people who are nostalgic have some great memories of fun times they had back when the game was new and when they were playing with their first characters in their first guilds. But often these people are treasuring their good memories, while at the same time forgetting (or downplaying) the not so great things from back then. If they could play Vanilla today, they would most likely not find the same level of fun they had back when they were new to the game, and they would most likely be annoyed by the lack of many of the quality-of-life improvements that have been added to the game since then.<br />
<br />
Whether or not people are nostalgic is certainly something that there are a lot of different opinions on, and we fully acknowledge and appreciate that. That being said however (and I know this may come across as being harsh or dismissing to some), the developers have the final word in the end. Their preference currently is to keep the game moving forward, and this means that their philosophy is to keep evolving and expanding the World of Warcraft universe - supporting old versions of the game does not fit well with that philosophy.

Following the exciting showing at gamescom in Cologne, Germany, the Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft team has an announcement to make—the European closed beta test is nearly here!<br />
<br />
In a few weeks, assuming all the cards have been properly shuffled, the murlocs have all been corralled, and the mana crystals have all been polished, we’ll start inviting players who’ve opted in to start playing. Exciting times!<br />
<br />
We’re really looking forward to you all getting a chance to check out this game, and we think everyone’s going to enjoy it—whether you love card games or have never played them before.<br />
<br />
There’s still time to sign up, so don’t delay! Once the EU closed beta test starts, we’ll begin working through the list of everyone who’s signed up, letting in a few groups at a time, so please be patient if you don’t get in straight away. Those murloc minions take a while to enter Battle.net addresses. Once you’ve been checked off the list, you’ll receive an email with instructions on how to download the game and start playing. Happy dueling!<br />

You hardly use this talent in raids, and when you do, you don't need to use it quickly in succession, what is the logic behind this? Sure I understand it's used in PvP alot, why don't they put that 4pc bonus on pvp gear? Such a waste of 4pc bonus, looks like most locks only need 2pc set now<br />

I guess your not raiding any heroics such as Lei Shen or dark animus then.</div></div><hr />

Having to hardcast a 2.5s healing spell (excluding instants every 1 minute) for an eclipse damage bonus is.. really meh imo. I'm still sticking to Heart of the Wild for tranquility on steroids or crazy movement phases like durumu.</div></div><hr />

Rogue Tier-15 4-piece set bonus now causes Shadow Blades to reduce the cost of all abilities by 15% (down from 40%).<br />
<br />
Seriously? They're going to wait until the PTR for the next flipping patch to nerf the set bonus to Shadow Blades? I would just LOVE to hear the reasoning behind this, which will be a huge nerf to the rogues in my guild. I don't think for one second it's fair for the other PTR nerf/unnerf cycle pawns like Assassin's resolve to &quot;make up&quot; for this. Those came after the fact in the first place!<br />

The reason was people were using T15 over T16 because it's just so incredible. Through all of the PTR testing I was using it with the set helm and just destroying, pair that with the CD reducing trinket and you've got some insane damage. It's just stupid though because it puts rogues in an awful place when SoO launches, that's a big nerf until we replace gear.</div></div><hr />

Jesus you really should not read patch note updates in isolation.<br />
<br />
So lets see.....<br />
<br />
Purification doubles power of healing rain so still 40% buff and 20% buff to range.<br />
<br />
Chain Heal does not lose power each jump and glyph change (lower CD on double length)<br />
<br />
HTT now baseline.<br />
<br />
New Talent that makes HST 220% more powerful.<br />
<br />
Conductivity rework.<br />
<br />
Yeah they are nerfing us to the ground.</div></div><hr />

Healing is slightly reduced cause the change to healingrain also involves being able to keep it up for 40 seconds and its radius is increased :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
cough gw2.......<br />
<br />
I would not mind FIVE buttons, but don't bring GW2's shadow boxing combat to this game, its horrid. One of the aspects of WOW's combat model I love is for example, when I parry it looks like it, when I use an ability that requires a target, well it requires a target. I hate GW2's combat engine, its cheap - its lazy developers, getting stuck on CD because an ability fires off with no target is hilariously lazy combat. The idea of 5 or so simple actions governed by weapon equipped was neat,but it does not make up for laziness elsewhere. <br />
<br />
My only ability issue with wow is having to use more than two bars for combat items, tanking is annoying as I usually end up flipping action bars for group/solo fights... Now, if I could stack abilities like Rift does in Macros - it fires off if its available, if not next ability fires - that would reduce key bloat<br />
<br />
They don't just have ability bloat in wow, they have spec bloat. Really, three specs for dps classes is a bit much - at least in the non-magic types. Its no wonder they cannot differentiate easily between them (rogue/hunter are worst, warriors aren't far behind)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I completely agree!<br />
<br />
I guess nobody wants the original game back, with bugs, lacking QoL improvements (like dual-spec and other engine/in game system tunnings, etc...).<br />
<br />
What ppl actually talk about vanilla and want back is gameplay aspect of it. Wich Blizzard, in a smart way, dismiss as asking for the original game back because ppl want the bugs back, the original lower quality graphics, etc. by saying that everything they did since Vanilla was just QoL stuff.<br />
<br />
Class homogenization isn't QoL for example. Broken specs is another one. The thing is that Blizzard don't want to say or admit it, but their own actions show that even them support that &quot;nostalgia&quot; by wanting ppl to go back to the world instead of sitting in a capital city spamming LFD/LFR. Guess when you used to go around the world instead of that? Vanilla/TBC/Half of WotLK... even in a bad way they do this by bringing back things like Inquistion that ppl asked to remove back then (not Inquisition itself, but the concept of keeping up a extreme low duration buff that is very important for performance. Back in vanilla used to be 30 segs Seals).<br />
<br />
Nobody wants to surf internet at 56k again, but I can see ppl wanting back a less stupid/agressive kind of internet back for example. Guess that it's impossible, but it can be for a game.</div></div><hr />

Would traffic actually decrease from wow now to vanilla or would it be like battle field barrens, where it was fun for about a week? Also I wouldnt mind the 5 button abilities bar as long as I could still have the other action bars for other stuff.</div></div><hr />

Yeah exactly, not like there's 10 buttons + dodge though &quot;cough idiots everywhere cough&quot;<br />

On that same note, somehow WoW is more dumbed down than anything i've seen even with the &quot;50 buttons to press&quot; approach, WoW is easy.<br />
