AE Tanking<br />
Here are ways we could make AE tanking trivial. None of these are things we would actually do, though players have suggested some things dangerously close to them.<br />
<br />
-- Challenging Shout has no cooldown. Everything is pretty much taunted to you the whole time.<br />
-- You can tank everything by spamming Commanding Shout. (Back when say warriors tanked the pre-Nef adds, they could do it by spamming Battle or Demo Shout, which generated terrible threat but just enough to actually work on that encounter. Now it really won't work... but it could with the right numbers.)<br />
-- Thunder Clap hits so freaking hard that you hit it once and never really have to again.<br />
-- Thunder Clap puts a dot on everything (stronger than Deep Wounds) so that you hit it once and never really have to again.<br />
-- Defensive Stance has an 8000% threat modifier.<br />
<br />
Those ideas would all work if we wanted you to never lose threat. That's not the goal. On the other hand, the goal also is NOT:<br />
<br />
-- Some tank classes just generate a lot more AE threat than others.<br />
-- Some tank classes just AE tank a lot easier than others.<br />
-- AE tanking gets harder and harder over time as dps specs gear up.<br />
-- AE tanking is really, really challenging and you're at the constant risk of losing aggro.<br />
-- Just for completeness, I'll add the original one above, which is that you never, ever lose threat no matter what.<br />
<br />
What we like about the warrior AE tanking model that is worth extending to other classes without just duplicating the warrior abilities:<br />
<br />
-- You hit more than one button.<br />
-- You hit different buttons than you do when handling single targets.<br />
-- You have to pay attention to crowd controlled targets.<br />
-- You don't totally ignore your single-target abilities.<br />
-- You might switch targets on some pulls. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/23767608815-please-do-away-with-faceroll-aoe-tanking.html))<br />

Beast Mastery<br />
If you're talking best possible gear, we think BM is pretty close to Survival in 3.3.3. Marks is ahead, and that's largely a function of armor pen, but again you are talking about absolute best gear. If you aren't in Icecrown 25 hard modes, then gear is likely to have just as much effect on your damage as spec. Ideally, things are balanced at all levels between level 1 and 80 with BiS gear, but there are going to be a lot of points along the way where that's probably not true. We see Survival hunters beat Marks hunters all the time in what I would categorize as average (meaning not server first guilds but capable of progressing) raids. Hopefully we'll see some BM guys up there too, but it may take higher gear levels. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23767539635-bm-hunters-still-need-help.html))<br />
<br />
I would be pretty surprised if guilds doing hard modes w/ access to lvl 80 BiS gear have hunters raiding as BM, or would be happy with a hunter choosing a spec that isn't min/max'd.<br />
My suspicion is that the hunters with the gear you are describing will have a propensity to go Marks, because that currently yields the highest damage and raiders tend to play whatever does the highest damage. In a world without armor pen, that might not be the case (though I haven't done the math lately).<br />
<br />
Nonetheless, it is also true today that Marks can beat Survival, and yet there are a lot of Survival hunters raiding. Our hope is that in 3.3.3 that there will be as many BM hunters as Survival raiding, which would be a really nice bump for BM. Maybe the estimates (ours and those I've read) about the boost BM is getting are overly optimistic. We'll see.<br />
<br />
It's possible the Survival hunters are only going Survival for Replenishment, though all 3 hunters bring some pretty solid raid benefits these days. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23767539635-bm-hunters-still-need-help.html))<br />

Shield Block<br />
If you don't think Shield Block is interesting enough today, that's a fine discussion to have. I'm a little surprised to see any nostalgia for the old model though. Hitting a relatively common dps button that plays into other talents and abilities is one thing. Having to constantly mash &quot;make me slightly more survivable&quot; is another. I'll grant you that it was fun on Illidan, but it took that mechanic specifically to make it fun.<br />
<br />
Imagine how you'd react to this scenario:<br />
<br />
GC: Good news, everyone! We lowered the cooldown of Shield Wall to 5 sec and balanced assuming you hit it every 5 sec.<br />
<br />
Tanks: Um.... Thanks? Could you maybe just make it a passive at that point?<br />
<br />
GC: But hitting buttons is fun! (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/23767557794-just-get-rid-of-dodge-and-parry-altogether.html))</div></div><hr />

our threat is fine, other classes are just spoiled - take it as a challenge and stop complaining...<br />
if you still want your class to be unique (i for one do) then we dont need to copy other classes all the time.<br />

not everything comes easy, you shouldnt want everything to be easy - it takes the fun out of playing, yet you would all still compain if it became to easy.</div></div><hr />

Because they didn't feel like it? What would posting a LK10-HC video do? It's sure as hell not going to allow people who are not 100% prepared to do it to suddenly begin downing it.

Quite obviously because it might give some tactical input on how to do the 25-man version, which is what matters. The release of this video might help some of those guilds that are close to a 25-man kill, but just needs that last bit of tweaking.</div></div><hr />

Yes it is. Many guilds out there never did anything else but execute existing tactics - and are quite good at it.<br />
If you release a video of a tactical fight, people will adopt and eventually kill it much faster.<br />
<br />
It's been that way for years.</div></div><hr />

Some people just realize by themselves if they misbehave , some don't. As far as i know, the guild who makes the firstkill posts a video, others wait for that. If you don't care, we all know now. Thanks for info.<br />
<br />
<br />
This just in: No one cares. News at 11.<br />
<br />
Seriously it's a video. In a few months it's not going to matter anyway, and right now it's only epeen points.</div></div><hr />

I understand some classes have it easier (Bear/paladin) while some don't (warrior/DK) but isn't that what makes the classes unique and makes some better than others in some aspect of tanking. I understand that people want everything easier but god forbid you have to work at tanking. I'm just waiting for the 5.0 patch to be along the lines of &quot;Tanking classes removed from the game, replaced with 'Tank' that has all tank abilities currently in game.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Not sure what everyone is getting at with the hate on this video, given that the race for 10m HM is over (if there really was one since 25m is where most people consider the real WF to be) then publishing a video really doesn't matter, even if people do use this to get some tactics, knowing them doesn't help at all, being able to execute them effectively is what matters, and I'd wager that most couldn't do this even with this video being shown.<br />
<br />
Watching that video actually showed the aspects of WOW that I wish more people would embrace, it actually sounded like the guys doing it were enjoying themselves and were able to be relaxed whilst taking on a really awesome encounter. People seem to have forgotten the fun in the game by hammering for WF, or at least thats how other top world guilds videos appear. Perhaps there was alot of raging on previous attempts, but seemed like a very awesome atmosphere to raid in.</div></div><hr />

Having to constantly mash &quot;make me slightly more survivable&quot; is another. I'll grant you that it was fun on Illidan, but it took that mechanic specifically to make it fun.<br />
<br />
Imagine how you'd react to this scenario:<br />
<br />
GC: Good news, everyone! We lowered the cooldown of Shield Wall to 5 sec and balanced assuming you hit it every 5 sec.<br />
<br />
Tanks: Um.... Thanks? Could you maybe just make it a passive at that point?<br />

If your a warrior, theres no &quot;MIGHT Switch&quot; at all. I have all 4 tank classes and my warrior is my main from day 1.....<br />
the ae tanking for a warrior is way under anything else, but blizz seems to have zero clue about that. they act like its not good, but they dont seem<br />

This is idiotic. No one like such skills like you said about your cooldowns and stuff. <br />
Put your AOE threat in your ass, we needed fix like months ago, not like now while we getting new expansion, you have not done anything to warriors since year and stop doing it now. Fucking idiot warrior developers have no any vote to make our class equal. <br />

I do agree, partly. But this boss have been standing for some time on the US-servers so it indicates that he is infact hard, even though you use 25man gear. And a hard boss beeing downed is impressive.</div></div><hr />

If you had any notion of how hard the 10m fight actually is, you would realize that it is kind of impressive. 10m HM LK is harder than almost any 25 man fight that came in wotlk, barring a small handful. Go get past HM Marrowgar and stfu until then.</div></div><hr />

Our Guild killed that boss already, and i have produced around 40 video guides for almost all bosses in wotlk. So you are right, i must be sucking like hell. For all those who are a little more informed than this deeply impressive young dude: <br />
<br />
My only worry concerns showing and spoilering tactics to the whole world in a very early state of kill progress. 3 kills in the world is not &quot;already boring bossfights&quot; nor &quot;some old and done content&quot;. Besides i'd bet we'll see 10 more kills this ID due to this video. And for those armory sniffers, yes, i did not participate in that kill, but being involved in pr and community issues for our guild, i think i am pretty well informed. <br />

you dont know, what you wanne tell the world, arent you.<br />
you are just mad, that they get some credits for releasing the video<br />

there is nothing like such a rule.<br />
only a bunch of guilds, thinking, they can get advantage of not showing anything.<br />
and if 1 guild decides to release the movie for every other 5mio ppl, because they enjoy it and are not to selfish, you are mad?^^<br />
<br />
i dont get it. you are one of those, that cant even say grats or thank for a competition. did you ever? ^^<br />

I find it funny that you think that 0.4 parts of a second for such a vast amount of information to travel between continents over a whole ocean, is actually slow.<br />
<br />
Sure according to standards of net speed, it is a bit slow. But come on! 0.4 seconds over a friggin' ocean! It would take weeks to travel that distance on a boat a hundred years ago! <br />
Those signals are going through cabels right? Think about that. Be glad Cthulhu hasn't tapped into your connection.<br />
<br />
<br />
So I can't complain that, at best, I'm half a second behind my guildies playing in the US, because at one point in history it would have taken 6 months to travel there?<br />
Thats pretty stupid. We ARE talking about the standards of internet speed, which could potentially be very near 'light speed'.<br />
400ms latency is LOW compared to what I get (600+, with the best residential net connection available in australia). 600ms latency means I'm standing in fire for at least one tick before I even know it is there; it means that Quartz or a similar addon is required for me to cast spells, otherwise I would spend half the time doing nothing. It means my 'instant cast' cleanses are sniped half a second before I cast them, even when I'm at the top of my game.<br />
<br />
Bottom line... congrats to Adept for the amazing kill, for overcoming the obstacles of lag to beat out US people.<br />
<br />
And please... oceanic servers in AUS please. Or singapore. Or NZ. And make our shut-down times not in the middle of prime raiding time on Tues night.</div></div><hr />

You make it seem that WF's come from not being the best players, but rather due to which guild has the best strategy.<br />
<br />
So what if other guilds copy your tactics and strategy, if your good enough you should down it before them. If they down it before you then simply put, they are better than you.<br />
<br />
Using an easier strategy =/= world best, seems you forgot that.</div></div><hr />

After watching that video a couple of times, my guild and I were able to waltz into 10-man Lich King HM, and easily 2-shot the boss. There is no way we would have done this without the video. Until we saw that, we had no idea we needed to move OUT OF the Shadow Trap or DODGE the Spirits. It was shocking. We were truly shocked.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alemayehu</div><div class="date">2010-03-19, 05:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Few things to comment on:<br />
<br />
Warriors: Bladestorm nerf, oh well won't be a big dent anyways. I mean, am I the only one who bladestorms after say a pummel or a warstomp (tauren war)? If some rogue is smart enough to sprint over and disarm me props to that dude. <br />
<br />
Also, on AOE tanking, I just spam cleave as well as shockwave (when off cd) and TC and I do great. If I notice something is not on my ass 100% I hit it upside the head with a shield slam and a few devastate/heroic strikes. Learning to switch targets is pretty easy seeing as how we stance dance to just utilize certain moves, maybe target a caster mob to see what its doing (you can nearly 1 shot mobs in heroic Old Kingdom for example by timing a spell reflect), IMO PvP more if you are tunnel-visioning so bad that you can't tab or left click another undead monster.<br />
<br />
People complaining about the warrior: We have a class that is wonderful at PvP, brings so many features, and is really really fun to play (just managing stances alone is tough when you are starting out). And if we are focusing on PvE...spell reflect? No other class has that. I mean count your blessings.<br />
<br />
Adept: Thank you for the video :D Will help a lot of people with Arthas.<br />
<br />
Tyrannitroll: Look buddy you have over 9000 achievement points. Work on RL for a while you already beat the game. Games are made so people have fun and it seems you got your money's worth. In my opinion, relax with some buddies (that don't play WoW), go out with your girlfriend, and give it a rest. <br />
<br />
Just because you don't like to help others doesn't mean someone else doesn't either. Why the hell should someone spend hours in frustration and agony??? Oh...because you did? You sound like those pretentious pricks at med schools who make students study subjects unrelated to medicine, work 90+ hours during a residency, etc. We have things like Magnetic Resonance Imaging and you think they can't shorten a kid's work-week? They make others do it because THEY had to do it. Don't try and drag people's name through the mud because they want to help others beat this game.<br />
<br />
Plus, if you have that much of a sense of accomplishment over destroying a computer-generated character, you have invested to much into this game (and I am not talking about money). SAVING LIVES or making MILLIONS of dollars does not make you better than another human being. If you think beating a computer game does you need to change your life bud. <br />
<br />
Life for your own life and accomplishments the horde means nothing in the real world.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fnx</div><div class="date">2010-03-19, 06:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After watching that video a couple of times, my guild and I were able to waltz into 10-man Lich King HM, and easily 2-shot the boss. There is no way we would have done this without the video. Until we saw that, we had no idea we needed to move OUT OF the Shadow Trap or DODGE the Spirits. It was shocking. We were truly shocked. Our performance and execution on that fight almost quadrupled simply by clicking on the Youtube video. Yes indeed after watching this video, with only many many attempts of just phase 1 under our belt we were able to waltz in and kill the boss, executing every phase, formation, and tactic flawlessly. <br />
<br />
Truly, 10-man Lich King HM will be on farm for every major world top 1,000 guild now. <br />
<br />
All thanks to that video. <br />
<br />
<br />
Tell me: Is there any really hard boss in the entire history of wow you killed before it got nerfed and/or tactics (or even encounter mechanics) were made public?<br />
I really doubt so. Because if you did, you would know that knowing these videos/tactics often makes you skip a major part of all the effort it takes to kill it, even if you don't realize it yourself. especially if there is more than one plausible direction to advance your tactics.</div></div><hr />
