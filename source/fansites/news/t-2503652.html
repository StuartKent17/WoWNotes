Based on name reservations so far, the Shazzrah realm is looking to be massively overpopulated. If all existing players on this server remain there, login queues in excess of 10,000 players are a certainty, and possibly much higher than that.<br />
<br />
We recently opened up the Gehennas realm, and we urge players on Shazzrah to consider moving there. There are a lot of players currently on Shazzrah and we want Gehennas to fill up before we open any new PvP realms. This is so that player population is spread as evenly as possible before launch, in order to provide the best play experience.<br />
<br />
While we are able to fit several times more players on a single realm in 2019 than was the case in 2006, we are not going to raise that cap any further, even though we have the technical capacity to do so. Raising realm caps would simply forestall the problem, letting more players in at launch but creating an unsustainable situation down the line, with severe queues when we turn off layering permanently before Phase 2 of our content unlock plan.<br />
<br />
Please also note that our realm population estimates of Low, Medium, High, and Full are based on this increased capacity – a Medium realm today already has more characters on it than even the most crowded realms did back in 2006.<br />
<br />
Our top priority in planning for WoW Classic’s launch has been ensuring that we are laying the groundwork for strong realm communities that will endure over the months and years to follow, which is why we’re cautiously opening new servers to meet demand.<br />

If that was how blizz did things, we'd be down to 25-30 retail realms crunched together.<br />
<br />
Blizz is the type to let dead realms fester, and even then, those who get &quot;consolidated&quot; are 2nd class when it comes to names, guild names, etc.<br />

And that would be a good thing. They can solve the name problem by allowing us last names, aliases or something like that. Or just expand on layering technology so that the server thinks players XX and XX are two different players - surely there has to be a back-end way to do this without being obvious to the player.</div></div><hr />

I'll jump on the example of ESO here specifically, because I know too little about the other MMO's that do Megaservers and what the situation is like there, but last I checked in with ESO (a few weeks ago), Both NA and EU Megaservers were riddled with horrible lag and have been for a while. Which makes playing the game properly (light-weaving, yada yada so on so forth) a lot more annoying than it should be. Megaservers done right I can get behind, don't care. But if your supposed 'fix' to the problem is to go with the trend of other MMO's, no thank you. I'd like to actually keep that laggy shitshow out of both modern WoW and WoW Classic.<br />

That sounds like a you PC kinda thing. I play ESO and have never once experienced a second of lag? I see more lag in BFA than i do ESO, no lie.<br />

Megaservers work just fine in ESO, they work fine in SWTOR, they work fine in plenty of other MMO's.<br />

Don't ff14's use megaservers or nah? I can't remember.<br />

Not one of these games comes even remotely close to the amount of players wow has. If 10 people wanna use a bus - all fit just fine but if a 100 wanna use it - it simply doesnt work. You either wait for the next bus or you use another one. Simple as that.</div></div><hr />

ESO has more players than WoW does. Granted, it's b2p but it has more players across PC, XB, and PS combined than wow. FF14 has also caught up and passed them in sub count (if you haven't been paying attention). Also, OSRS has more players than ANY of them so... yeah</div></div><hr />

They have layering in mind. But in a couple months they expect still FAR more players on these servers than what would be healthy for the game.<br />

their MAU and shareholder meetings (I do own stock in them and listen in) tell the story, plus anyone can see BFA is prolly the lowest population wise wow has ever been.<br />

The higher population the server, the better the odds it will have a healthy and vibrant population long term.<br />

And more trash. This is so much bullshit its not even worth arguing about.<br />
<br />
Besides that back to topic. Blizzard said: &quot;Medium realm today already has more characters on it than even the most crowded realms did back in 2006.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now imagine this without layering. How would this be healthy for the game? 30 people constantly waiting for a quest mob at all levels. No ore/herbs on the map. The game would be destroyed. <br />
<br />
So they can technically even add more players if they want to. &quot;While we are able to fit several times more players on a single realm in 2019 than was the case in 2006, we are not going to raise that cap any further, even though we have the technical capacity to do so.&quot;<br />

Its just not good for the game. Understand that.</div></div><hr />

They do have better tech, it's used on retail and it's a mix of CRZ and sharding. For the sake of classic, an altered version of sharding, called &quot;layering&quot;, will ease the launch rush of classic but then get disabled.<br />
<br />
We wanted the standard server experience for classic. It's an &quot;us&quot; problem, not a &quot;blizzard&quot; problem.<br />

What I find hilarious is that the community worked together across regions to choose streamer and &quot;people&quot; servers. Blizzard gave both US and EU the same warning.</div></div><hr />

Well, if people were warned and yet they still went with option A I guess queue times wont mater versus a dead server. Best of luck to all the players figuring out ways to keep themselves logged in so as to avoid a long queue.</div></div><hr />

I just remember i did this back in vanilla, and the realm they recommended to me ended up as a complete ghost town by the time TBC came out. I had to pay them to transfer, lost my original name, and i will not be taking that path twice.<br />
<br />
If it means i gotta have queues for the first months, so be it.</div></div><hr />

They announced beforehand that these new servers will be added. You could have done your name reservation on these servers just like on the other ones as well. No damage to be fixed. Just people beeing stubborn and stupid.</div></div><hr />

That's the exact shitty thing that happened that caused the lack of community in this game we have today. Instead of just increasing the number of people that can be on a server, which they straight up admit they can do, they're adding in new servers that won't have the population to start with and will lose just as many people as the other servers resulting in dead servers.<br />
<br />
That leaves them two options; forced mergers, which screws people over on their names or cross realms, which kills the community.<br />
<br />
They need to just get their heads out of their own asses and just increase the servers capacity. Sure, at start you'll be a faceless name in a massive crowd, but it's better than any of the alternatives.</div></div><hr />

no its not better. Its far worse. Extremly overcrowded servers means no one will be able to play the game. NOT AT ALL. There is a reason for why they dont let more people play on these servers. ITS NOT HEALTHY FOR THE GAME. Gosh why people dont understand that.<br />

Sure you could wait in a 10k queue and assume that a server that is more populated than any server 2006 was, will die out in a couple months OR you listen to blizzard and dont wait in a 10k queue and enjoy the game. All up to you. As i said blizzard cant fix you.</div></div><hr />

From what i read, the only lag is in the megapvp zone Cyrodiil (which explains why i didn't see any, i didn't touch cyrodiil in my return to ESO). And to be fair, i did say that eso was b2p and had the benefit of consoles for population too. <br />
<br />

tell me about it, i started Stormscale EU as alliance, then Bronze Dragonflight, then Ghostlands as horde until it literally died and had like 3 max lvl characters online at rush hours, left game for 3 years, Bladefist until it started dying, 2 years, then Twisting Nether and f8ck it and no way EVER to even think of go to f8cking dead servers again<br />
Ghostlands is ranked 'medium' and it literally had for weeks a max of 3 max lvl characters horde, u can't even think of go a dungeon not talking about raids, Ghostlands was amazing in wrath but i bet so was entire wow back then when we had 12 million sub with zero from china which had 5 million during TBC (because china banned wrath, u can even check how wrath zones look in china, heck death knight is renamed unhappy knight in china)</div></div><hr />

I'd rather wait in a que every time for the first few months and 100% know that my server would be populated 1 year down the road than move to the consolation realm and be trapped on essentially a lower pop server after the rush dies down.<br />

This is a YOU problem blizzard, fix it.<br />

ESO, and every other MMO's out there do MEGAservers that have all the players in a SINGLE server.<br />

Maybe you guys should invest in better tech? kk thanks for classic tho<br />

This is the same mentality why PVP sharding is messed up. People jump to the shards where their side is winning, and people are leaving the shards where they are losing.<br />

This is the worst thing they could ever do, and they do everything they can to avoid this. In the MMO world, merging servers is the same as saying &quot;Our game is dying&quot; and they don't want to send that signal to the community even when its false.</div></div><hr />

That's pretty funny about the unhappy knight. I've heard about china banning wotlk before, but i never heard about &quot;Unhappy knight&quot; so i got a good chuckle there.<br />

<br />
<br />
From the post:<br />
<br />
Please also note that our realm population estimates of Low, Medium, High, and Full are based on this increased capacity – a Medium realm today already has more characters on it than even the most crowded realms did back in 2006.<br />
<br />
They increased server capacity quite substantially in recent years on Live. And yes, the servers show pop based on how many are logged in, NOT how many characters they have in total. If a server is shown as Full, that is A LOT of players online at that moment.<br />
<br />
Classic servers are not Live servers, as they said in the post they could increase their capacity using tech that applies to Live, but they don't want to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizz is the type to let dead realms fester, and even then, those who get &quot;consolidated&quot; are 2nd class when it comes to names, guild names, etc.<br />

This is a blizz problem, not a player count problem.<br />

You clearly were not taught to read properly. I am not going to take a chance and play on a lesser populated realm. I would rather suffer through queues and feel secure that my wow classic experience will be great still a year or 2 from now.<br />
<br />
Not that i think the other realms will die out overnight or anything, but it's inevitable in an MMORPG that one realm is viewed as THE realm of that type. I can give you countless examples throughout other games, hell, look at CURRENT WoW and you'll see only 3-5 realms that people flock to in droves.<br />
<br />
Once that snowball affect starts happening and people start migrating from the lower realms to THE realm, it can't be stopped and it is inevitable; make no mistake about it.<br />

The worst part for me is that they aren't even increasing the player created character limit... so if i want to &quot;risk&quot; starting over on stalagg, i have to toss out my primo names on Herod and who wants to do that?<br />
<br />
maybe if they increased the reserved name count and people could attempt to grab the names on Stalagg too without consequence, this would be received better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can't imagine that you have that suggestion following a statement about the intelligence of a multi-billion dollar company. <br />
<br />
Adding 30 or 40 more servers and not take population and long-term engagement into account would be a surefire way to end up with entirely dead servers though. Won't that be fun in a version of the game where people can't transfer characters?<br />
<br />
They'll add more servers for sure if they see a need for it down the line once the initial hype rush has mellowed out and long-term numbers and patterns become discernable.</div></div><hr />

If you were old enough to understand, you'd know that with servers that it is INEVITABLE that one server will become THE server to be at for each type (pve, pvp, etc) and that it happens in every single MMORPG with realms that has EVER existed. it's human nature<br />
<br />
even in retail wow, there are a handful of realms seen as the S tier realms, and everything else is inferior. /crys in skullcrusher<br />
<br />
It's always a great sign of maturity when you dismiss another persons argument by referring to their assumed age. As if saying &quot;if you were old enough&quot; makes you seem trustworthy and mature. Fuck off and get over yourself and learn a thing or two about forming an argument that doesn't involve talking down to people to make yourself seem more appealing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, when people throw out how ESO has surpassed WOW in terms of population, lets not forget that Xbox, Play Station, and PC are figured into those numbers, where as wow was number 1 in terms of Subs for years and only had Pc to rely on for those numbers. <br />
<br />
As per the stability of these over crowded servers, sadly Blizzard will have to implement some other measures to remedy the issue because there is no way in hell any one who has already reserved a name is going to move to another server on their own free will.<br />
<br />
ESO has like 500k players and Wow have around 5 million. People are pulling numbers out of their asses and saying things they have no clue about.</div></div><hr />

Yeah everybody is missing the point that they have created 2-3 mega servers of each realm type. The important part of the post was:<br />
<br />
&quot;Please also note that our realm population estimates of Low, Medium, High, and Full are based on this increased capacity – a Medium realm today already has more characters on it than even the most crowded realms did back in 2006&quot;<br />
<br />
Even if there is the inevitable drop, the small number of large servers they have launched with will likely avoid any server becoming a &quot;ghost town&quot;.<br />

You've missed the entire point of Classic. Blizzard could as well just have 1 big realm and use sharding to deal with overcrowding, but that's not how vanilla used to be and that's certainly not what the players who've asked for classic want either.</div></div><hr />

ESO has 500k subs, not players. There is a difference since it's b2p. Also they have consoles as an edge that WOW doesn't so it's hard to really compare them straight up.<br />
<br />
I was only pointing out that those games ARE popular since the previous person utterly dismissed them as beneath wow, when both are easily WOW's biggest competition they've ever faced. FF14, in particular, has really challenged WoW for sub counts (no, i'm not a ff14 player. it's too jrpg for me)</div></div><hr />

Not that i think the other realms will die out overnight or anything, but it's inevitable in an MMORPG that one realm is viewed as THE realm of that type. I can give you countless examples throughout other games, hell, look at CURRENT WoW and you'll see only 3-5 realms that people flock to in droves.<br />
<br />
Once that snowball affect starts happening and people start migrating from the lower realms to THE realm, it can't be stopped and it is inevitable; make no mistake about it.<br />

in 2 years, if you're still playing classic, i'll be on herod waiting to say &quot;I told you so&quot;<br />

Why dont they stop people from creating new characters on Herod, just like FFXIV does with Balmung?<br />
<br />
Maybe they have?<br />
<br />
When they say &quot;move&quot;, they then suggest people having reserved names move to a new server where they might not get their reserved name.<br />
Not very surprising if many won't take them up on that. Especially considering how newly opened servers can become ghost towns down the line, and Classic doesn't offer character transfers. <br />

This should be on them to solve, not the customers, imo.</div></div><hr />

I didn't paint WoW at any number. I suspect it's prolly around 3 mil if i had to guess but it's just speculation based on MAU in qtrly reports and best guess work.<br />
<br />
FF14 isn't for me tho and i'm not out here trying to fanboy over a game i don't play.<br />

i just remember reading that it was close to, if not already, passed wow in sub counts with the recent expac that people seem to love. /shrug.<br />

I don't care for your argument or the servers. It's just so damn frustrating to see someone like you take a persons argument and dismiss it completely by referring to something as irrelevant as his age. How does his age have anything to do with a discussion about whether players have a tendency to aggregate on certain realms? Is it because that during your long life, you have witnessed countless situations like this and now have to teach us lesser younglings your infinite wisdom?

Source? Everything I can find regarding SE's claim that it has X million players is them referring to any accounts made during the lifetime of the game. <br />
<br />
&quot;This number includes registered players, both free trial ones and paid users, over the last five years since the game relaunched as A Realm Reborn.”<br />

Even worse Queen of Hamsters, they aren't raising the limit on character creation that we can make from 3 :( so if people have names they are attached to on Herod, or the EU populated server... they aren't gonna delete them for a chance to secure them on the other realm.<br />

I admit he may have got under my skin, but he literally ignored several good arguments of mine and went to 12 year old insults which i eventually (after the third time) responded in a condescending manner.<br />
<br />
Go re-read it, he was being an absolute troll lobbing insults.<br />
<br />
That said, i apologize if we got off on the wrong foot wiltrold &lt;3.<br />
<br />
I have been a victim of this in every MMORPG i've ever played, and WoW itself has burned me with this same move twice in the past by recommending X server... only for it to die a slow death and i'm forced to open the wallet again.<br />
<br />
WoW isn't alone in this either, it happens in every MMORPG ever with servers.<br />
<br />
For SWTOR, i remember watching everyone migrate to fatman.<br />
<br />
Once one server is viewed as THE server of that type for a community; it will remain that basically forever. I'd rather suffer through long queues for a few months and feel 100% confident my server will still be heavy populated long term, then risk the newest server they are recommending and being in the same spot a year or 2 from now of having to move to herod anyway.<br />
<br />
Also, blizz could really do themselves a favor here and increase the count from 3 to 5 characters able to be created. They want us to migrate to stalagg, but i'd have to actually delete the characters on herod with the names i want to even take a chance at the names on stalagg... why risk that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Players might be hyped to hell and back right now, but it wouldn't be good business to just preemptively throw servers at Classic only to see massive drop offs and spread of players.<br />
<br />
After all, the server someone chooses to level on will be where that character is then stuck, even if it becomes a dead server eventually. <br />

Where is the problem to have everybody log in and make a character on the same realm at the same time? It is not hard to organize. I mean, the only problem would be when a friend comes couple of months later and wants to play with you. Then it might be that he has to wait some more days to make a character on your realm. This happened for me in AION, a friend wanted to try this game too, months after it was released. He had to wait for like 3 days until he could make a character on my realm. I still think that is a little price for a perfect balance on the realms. <br />
<br />
And if a release is about to happen, and you and your friends all wanna play this game. (classic in this particular case) then it shouldn't be to hard to have everyone make their characters on the same day on the same realm. And if someone doesn't want to do that, then it is the reason I mentioned, none wants to make character on low pop realms, not even with a group of friends. But, that would be a non issue if a system like AION would be used, then there would be almost no low pop realm.</div></div><hr />

Players might be hyped to hell and back right now, but it wouldn't be good business to just preemptively throw servers at Classic only to see massive drop offs and spread of players.<br />
<br />
After all, the server someone chooses to level on will be where that character is then stuck, even if it becomes a dead server eventually. <br />
<br />
I still don't understand why they can't increase server capacity and maybe decrease it if the population sinks? If they can add, surely they can remove...?I assume because no amount of extra server capacity and hardware can fix a certain number of players in the same location causing lag and the bigger you make the overall server capacity the more you run into problems of local concentrations.</div></div><hr />

If my friend who hasn't ever played wow, logged in and i had to tell him &quot;try to make a toon next week, blizz said no this week&quot; blizz would be out of several subs.<br />

That is absolute lunacy, and AION probably lost hundreds of players over that stupid forcefeeding decision.<br />

Although this is right, but in this particular case, its about creating a server architecture that comes as close as possible to the one used in 2006, while also managing some of its problems. I think if blizzard would create WoW2 today with all their experience they could come up with something better than anyone else uses.</div></div><hr />

If someone really wants to play a game with a friend. And he has to wait from Monday to Wednesday to make a toon. And he is not capable of waiting that &quot;long&quot; then sorry, the game wouldn't have been something for this particular person to find interesting in the first place and/or is not really interested in playing with you in general. We never had to wait 1 week btw. none said that. You are making things up now.</div></div><hr />

It's more about the principle of the matter tbh.<br />
<br />
If he is told he has to wait to play because blizz arbitrarily decided his server for them, they'd just unsub.<br />
<br />
I guarantee AION lost more players over that decision than they gained.<br />
<br />
it is a lose/lose proposition, both for gamers and for blizzard and would only be done by a desperate dev team with a lack of imagination, IMHO</div></div><hr />

True, but i don't think limiting new players or banning players from a server is the answer either.<br />
<br />
And like i told the kindly Queen of Hamsters, blizz wants us to migrate to Stalagg or the other server... but didn't increase the character creation limit, so we'd have to give up and delete our reserved names for a mere chance at that name on the lower populated server.<br />

True, and we can agree to disagree my friend.<br />
<br />
What we can agree on is, like you said, that this has been handled poorly in almost every regard... from not having quite enough realms listed to begin with, to limiting character creation (thus discouraging people from stalagg since who's gonna delete from herod to do so?), begging the players, etc...<br />
<br />

Blizz fk'd up big time, it's like selling 1000 tickets to ride a 30 man bus, All they thought about was the poss money coming in and not were the hell there customers would go, and these are the people running the game these days, no wonder things are such a mess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem for me, and i imagine others; is that blizz begged us to abandon herod but didn't raise the character creation limit... so to move, i'd have to literally delete my reserved good names to take a wild gamble that those names MAY be available on stalagg or the other realms (they won't be)<br />
<br />
So i'm now stuck between a rock and a hard place of staying on herod and living with queues (my real only choice) or risking it all on a chance, for a realm that will definitely be lower population than herod down the road.<br />
<br />
It just isn't worth it, but if blizz let people make MORE characters and i could try reserving names without /deleting my others, well, maybe i'd have considered it.</div></div><hr />

Why risk that?I completely agree with you, I probably wouldn't switch server either.<br />
If they could add space to reserve names on the new servers specifically that would be nice but it also runs into why there is a limit in the first place. <br />
<br />
With a limit its much more reliable to draw data from those numbers since less people will simply reserve their names on every server. Now Blizzard can see who plans to play where (to a certain degree). And with an extended limit there is no real way to see how many people actually plan to switch to the new server instead of the completely full ones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They announced the new servers beforehand. People could reserve their names on them just as well. There is simply no problem that blizzard is capable of fixing. If people are so extremly stubborn and stupid, how could they handle them? The server for the 2006 classic experience is full. Thats a fact. They cant just magically make it not full. Its all in the hands of the people - they move and make it for themselves work or they dont.<br />
<br />
Again if you use the metapher of the bus. If 100 people are waiting for the bus and there can only go 25 in - how should the bus driver fix it to make every 100 go in? They could send a bigger bus beforehand but that would not be the classic bus everyone wanted. So you can just hope that the people go for another bus. :D</div></div><hr />

Limited servers is because of fear of player retention.<br />

at first i was happy with the word 'overcrowded' then,, 10k ?<br />
server can hold only 10k !? that low!? and no one even talking about it ?<br />
does that mean that retail wow has less than a million player, since server most capacity is just 10k, and there are like only 5 full servers total rest are desert ? (less than a million, heck at that rate entire wow playerbase is a miserable joke of 100k in eu)<br />
<br />
does my post answer u ? if full servers can hold max 10k, and seriously other servers are just desert and probably all of them combined don't even have 10k, make the math, or just throw a random guess based on the confirmed number of only a miserable sh8tty number of just 10k MAX at server<br />
<br />
where are you getting the 10k number from? the login queue? that doesn't indicate that the max cap of a server is 10k, that is talking about the login queue. two completely seperate things</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're mistaken, the reason why there's no sub dip in WotLK was because it's released in China around the end of its era in other regions. While people were leaving in other regions because of the content drought millions of people were finally able to play WotLK in China. I played on Chinese realms back then, it's a very short-lived xpack as well, it's replaced w/ Cata fairly soon after.<br />
<br />
And don't forget how they counted Chinese subs, it wasn't a one month sub there, we could pay hourly, but even paying for 1hr would make you count as a legit sub, people were always complaining about how Blizz counted subs, but, unfortunately, we'll never know how many real subs there's in 2009 &gt;_&gt;</div></div><hr />

Yeah, you're right to not trust that statement.<br />

1.7 million might seem realistic to someone from the good old &quot;lol dead gaem&quot;-crowd, but that crowd was always grossly underestimating the game, even when subs were revealed. <br />

<br />
Now you have time to talk to your friends about maybe starting on the new server instead.<br />
<br />
I basically agree with this...for Classic to succeed...because of no CRZ/ Cross realm LFD/LFR and 40 man raid size...it needs fairly strong server communities and Blizzard being conservative at the start is the best approach imho.<br />
<br />
There's also the issue that if they increase the size of Herod (which they acknowledge they have the capacity to do) that even more will flock to it and when the inevitable population drops happens Herod's population will be reasonable but the other servers will become low population because they didn't have as many people to begin with or flock to the busier server (Herod).<br />

The problem for Blizzard is that they really don't know what the drop off rate will be and when it will happen because Classic is a giant ongoing experiment. Blizzard isn't faultless in all this. They probably actually should have lowered the total capacity of the servers and limited name reservations to 1 (think about it - you never got to reserve your name before to begin with and you definitely didn't get to reserve names for Alts). If they were worried about nostalgia in this regard reserving 1 name still would have been good enough because most people that had alts gained 1 toon in Vanilla and if that name wasn't available they could use their second best known character name to potentially reconnect with friends. If you won't play Classic because you didn't get a specific name you probably weren't sticking around long anyway.</div></div><hr />

I do take ff14 subs with a grain of salt. I’ve said I’m not a player of ff14 but to dismiss them as nothing is ignorant as they are gaining popularity and it gets good reviews. /shrug not my cup of tea tho and that’s ok<br />
<br />
Swtor has always ran poorly because they chose a poor game engine, but they have come a long way in terms of cleaning it up over the years. <br />
<br />
Eso runs like a dream outside of cyrodiil, and to be fair, no mmo runs great with pvp the size and scope of cyrodiil. Wow doesn’t either, see big pvp clashes on the wow classic beta or in bfa for proof. Around 100 players fighting in a small area and wow starts to suffer too<br />
<br />
Swtor definitely is not a threat to wow but eso and ff14 are popular and pretty well received</div></div><hr />

ff14 was bragging all over the internet about the sales of their recent expac and how many people bought it etc.<br />
<br />
For the record, i don't play ff14 so i'm not gonna beat the drum for it or anything. <br />

All i was doing was pointing out to the person who dismissed it as nothing, that, FF14 is probably the biggest threat WoW has faced in this generation (the 2010's).<br />

To be fair saying top sub could just be &quot;top sub by review from x.&quot;<br />

Wow has it's issues, but the core game is solid. You press a button and things happen. It's not like ESO or SW where you press buttons and you wait a second for something to happen (not lag, actual just poor responsiveness).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marrilaife</div><div class="date">2019-08-17, 02:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">tell me about it, i started Stormscale EU as alliance, then Bronze Dragonflight, then Ghostlands as horde until it literally died and had like 3 max lvl characters online at rush hours, left game for 3 years, Bladefist until it started dying, 2 years, then Twisting Nether and f8ck it and no way EVER to even think of go to f8cking dead servers again<br />
Ghostlands is ranked 'medium' and it literally had for weeks a max of 3 max lvl characters horde, u can't even think of go a dungeon not talking about raids, Ghostlands was amazing in wrath but i bet so was entire wow back then when we had 12 million sub with zero from china which had 5 million during TBC (because china banned wrath, u can even check how wrath zones look in china, heck death knight is renamed unhappy knight in china) Yep, I remember back in wotlk they gave me (and everyone else) &quot;free transfers&quot; off Argent Dawn EU because it was full and often queued. Guess what, I dumped some alts on these &quot;transfer servers&quot; (Moonglade and Darkmoon Faire) and kept playing on AD, until I left to look for better raiding opportunities. Fast forward few years and I wanted to check out playing my old alts... holy hell, both Moonglade and Darkmoon Faire are deader than dead. <br />
<br />
Oh yeah, Chamber of Aspects was another EU server where they tried to dump overpopulation from other servers. Guess what, it's dead too! <br />
<br />
Which servers aren't dead? The ones that were full pop since basically TBC. Well not even that is guaranteed, since Sylvanas, Frostmane and Al'Akir used to be full and are semi dead now. <br />
<br />
I'm also regretting letting myself be milked for hundreds of euro on transfers over the years until I got wiser and settled down on a server that is full and has raiding population (Argent Dawn didn't really cuz it's RP). <br />
<br />
Now remember Classic has 40 man raids so you need even more people than you need on &quot;retail&quot; for it to work. <br />
<br />
Imo best thing would be to leave many servers up but then aggressively merge them as the population drops because it always drops faster on low pop than high pop (people quit equally but then low pop migrates to high pop making low even lower but compensating for the ones who quit on high pop). Since they failed to do it on retail, they are expected to be equally or more negligent on Classic, because &quot;Classic is about realm communities&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure ESO recently had server troubles because the population spiked to almost 2M concurent players in a very short period and the devs weren't expecting it.Led to horrible stuff such as several hours long queues and cyrodiil being unreachable.

<br />
<br />
Because what you're saying is opinion, not fact. <br />
<br />
I can state examples of things that have been implemented that on paper show they've been bad for the games health, but if they've actually been the direct cause and not just correlation are debatable. <br />
<br />
- CRZ. They came about to make the world feel more alive with people in them when there were very few on your particular realm in that area. Instead, you're sharded into the zone with other people who are also in the zone. The good; more people there to do things with. The bad; more competition for things like rares, herbs, ore, mobs, etc.<br />
- LFG. Implemented to make group finding easier. The good; a heck of a lot easier to find people to group with. The bad; hard to make consistent connections in the game as you're being matched with people on dozens of realms instead of just yours, easily replaceable so people don't try to stick around and learn fights, instead just quitting and finding others, and a watered down level of content to compensate for all the negatives it brings.<br />
- Overpowered catch up gear. This lowers player engagement as they know they can sub for a month, do the dungeons / raids 1 time and then unsub because they will be given catch up gear in the next patch that is easy to obtain and will put them up to a higher level than if they stuck around and farmed gear for the entire time.<br />
<br />
All of those have clear examples in the sub numbers throughout time that have shown just how bad they are for the health of the game. The game is not healthy when its subs swing wildly month to month, patch to patch, expansion to expansion. <br />
<br />
<br />
So looking at all those, your argument kind of loses its oomph. How layering more people onto a server, which again they admit they can do, and having those layers slowly drop to fewer and fewer layers as the server pop drops is a bad thing, I just don't get why you think that's bad. It won't increase queue times, in fact it lowers them as those people are layered. It won't have the negative effects that other &quot;fixes&quot; have had over time.</div></div><hr />

If you let all people freely on these realms they cant turn off layering. It's literally in the blue post.<br />
<br />
Raising realm caps would simply forestall the problem, letting more players in at launch but creating an unsustainable situation down the line, with severe queues when we turn off layering permanently before Phase 2 of our content unlock plan.<br />

If the highest classic server only reaches medium on it's starting day it's a stillbirth.<br />

You can't compare things like &quot;Yeah, what was full back then is medium today, it will be healthy&quot; because nobody will be online for 10 hours a day just for grinding like a lot of people were 10 years ago.

Anybody should know that, especially those clamoring about how much community matters in Vanilla. Wanting a retarded amount of servers is absolutely retarded.<br />
<br />
Every single server is going to be healthy at the start, it's what happens long term. Considering the technology is actually there, I don't care if I end up on a 'dead' server months down the road because they will eventually merge Classic realms if population gets too low anyway. They mentioned this was a love letter to their fans, allowing a dead server to persist for any length of time seems like something they wouldn't/shouldn't do.<br />
<br />
For those of you against merging servers, I ask, why? You realize you don't lose your name and that it's just merely attached to your initial server like it does on the live version of the game. In the events of merged server down the road, it wouldn't be anything like what we have on live simply because none of the social or anti-social (whatever you want to call them) would be present in the game either. It would literally be a merging of AH and populations with nothing more. Connected realms get a bad wrap because it was around the same time period when they started adding sharding, which wouldn't be the case.<br />
<br />
They literally flat out said they COULD increase server caps, but that wouldn't really fix the problem. Why? Because they're committed to removing layering when or before phase 2 hits, and while they could add additional layers to increase the theoretical cap people don't want them to do that because people have a seething hatred for layering for some reason. In a world where people were more okay with layering, they could have added more layers and this wouldn't be nearly an issue. You essentially could have had your cake and eaten it too, but anti-layering sentiments basically remove that option.<br />
<br />
So what are we left with? You have a giant amount of people on Herod hoping that others on Herod will leave to make the server more stable, while those very same people have the exact same attitude. Some will heed the warning and jump ship, and we're left with loads of people on one server that are likely going to be on these very forums or Blizzard forums for 'x' amount of time claiming how retarded it is and what a shit company Blizzard is for having queues for simply logging into the game. People setting aside hours each evening or taking a few weeks off work, stuck on a server where it might take them hours to get on (not even accounting for possibly disconnects) in the first place.<br />
<br />
I played the game 15 years ago and it was an unmitigated disaster for the first few weeks, and one of the only reasons it got better is because people got fucking sick of sitting in queues and simply changed servers within the first few days. I remember getting home from school when I was 18 and immediately going to my computer to login just so I could get into the queue. From that moment I knew I had well over 45 minutes of wait time before hopefully getting into the game (permitting that I didn't disconnect on the login screen). A little unknown fact, but the game never use to kick for being idle too long when WoW was first released. They added this in because people would literally never logout of the game just so they could get around waiting in the fucking queue.<br />
<br />
Personally I don't give a shit, and would rather get to play the game as opposed to not. If it gets dire enough on the server that I rolled on where the community is dying, I'll patiently wait for them to merge servers, or just potentially transfer if that option exists. What I'm not dealing with is a repeat of what happened 15 years ago where you waited in enormous queues and the game was a slide show when you got in anyways.

Megaservers work just fine in ESO, they work fine in SWTOR, they work fine in plenty of other MMO's.<br />
<br />
Don't ff14's use megaservers or nah? I can't remember.<br />
<br />
It's 10 years past time for WoW to do that<br />
<br />
you never experienced lag in ESO? have you even been to Cyrodiil? that place can get as bad as wintergrasp or worse... I played ESO casually, once in a while to check the content i can solo and use it as a bridge between skyrim and tes6, but hell no to ESO being lag free</div></div><hr />

The overdramatics of this post have me cackling. “Hold Blizzard responsible” :,,,,,) like they’ve committed a damn murder or something. Have you even tried checking to see if the name is available on another realm? I’m sure the numbers will even out or in reality not be that bad on launch day. There’s always queues with launches anyway, it’s no biggie.</div></div><hr />

Guessing many People will just try to get their name again on the other server or just go with a different name. Not everyone is so anal about the name their character has to the point they'd rather be in massive queues.</div></div><hr />

Oh really? Thats not my experience playing wow since launch. Several servers I have played on have been affected by this. You login one day, and find out the whole eastern EU has migrated to your realm for some reason and suddenly english is the rare language. I have seen servers die out from this.

It's not like this is my opinion or something. This is fact.<br />
<br />
They can't turn off layering permanently before Phase 2 for those realms. I fail to see how that's a problem. So what that the layering on those realms takes until Phase 4 of their content drop?

You can't compare things like &quot;Yeah, what was full back then is medium today, it will be healthy&quot; because nobody will be online for 10 hours a day just for grinding like a lot of people were 10 years ago.

It's not like this is my opinion or something. This is fact.<br />
<br />
as long as you have layers active, people can abuse jumping between those layers just as connected servers... no cohesive world, jumping to rares, nodes and away from players you ganked... <br />

layer hopping does not require an extensive LFG tool but just the ability to search for groups in a channel/friends/communities etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reality is you won't be able to play for a long time. You should expect literally 10 hour queues AT LEAST. Honestly that's lowballing it hard on Shazz EU. <br />
<br />
Also, people that are in will try to cheat the system, by adding anti afk bots (PLEASE BAN THOSE PEOPLE BLIZZ) to stay in when they sleep (not work, these guys have no life). <br />
<br />
Queue can end at 4AM. There you go, wake up in the middle of the night and play until you have to go to work.<br />
<br />
This is not just a launch day thing either. It will last for a LONG time. Fast forward a month. You still have queues. <br />
<br />
You barely have had time to play the game. All because you were too stubborn to change realm, when everyone, including Blizzard, told you this would happen.<br />
<br />
And the guild channels and community channels that refuse to change realm. Your discords will be a complete drama madhouse if you decide to not change realm. Your guildies won't be able to log in to level either, they will be stuck in their 30s while people on low pop realms will hit 60 and start raiding.<br />
<br />
Also, if you have been waiting for Classic for as long as many people here has. Thinking you have the self control to sit in a queue while everyone else is enjoying the best game that has ever been created... More power to you</div></div><hr />

Is that really a huge risk though? You delete your Herod characters one at a time and make them on the other server. If the name is taken you could always just switch back unless you're worried someone is going to take the name in the &lt;5 minutes this takes.<br />

If 100 people are waiting for the bus and there can only go 25 in - how should the bus driver fix it to make every 100 go in? They could send a bigger bus beforehand but that would not be the classic bus everyone wanted. So you can just hope that the people go for another bus. :D<br />
<br />
Your example doesn't really work though. If I was on a bus that could only fit 25 people and there were 100 of us, I would happily get on the second bus because I don't want to be cramped and there is no incentive for me to stay. <br />
<br />
This is what I'm saying the problem is - if they let people now reserve names on the new servers in addition to their current reserved names you will get a lot more people swapping. What a lot of people don't want is to lose their name. Some people have concerns about becoming a ghost server which is a separate thing.</div></div><hr />

It's not a tech issue, it's a game design issue.<br />

I guess queue times wont mater versus a dead server<br />
Ah yes, i suppose that if you don't have a job/family, 1+ hour queue at EVERY login for MONTHS does not matter at all. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
I was on one of those realms at that time and i can assure you that even if at that time i had all the time in the world, waiting 1+ hours EVERY single time i wanted to play, for MONTHS, was really BAD. We all moved to a low-pop realm and lived happily till today.<br />

The idea of classic is to recreate the classic feel. There were neither Megaservers nor Sharding in Classic. I understand that they might use a bit of the latter tech at launch, but classic wasn't meant to be able to crump all players into one server.<br />
<br />
For example...<br />
I guess that they'll also recreate the classic resource node and spawn timers. Meaning NO dynamic spawn based on player pop. Letting more people into the same server at the same time will inevitably result in a massive competition for the few existing resources. <br />
<br />
In other words: You want classic? Deal with it!</div></div><hr />

And don't forget how they counted Chinese subs, it wasn't a one month sub there, we could pay hourly, but even paying for 1hr would make you count as a legit sub, people were always complaining about how Blizz counted subs, but, unfortunately, we'll never know how many real subs there's in 2009 &gt;_&gt;<br />
i know it got released less than a month from cata patch, also i know how sub count, they do same for Korea<br />
it is why there is sh8tload of chineese goldfarmers, because they don't buy entire game, just pay per hour as the deal between blizz and china, not to mention blizz don't get full profit from china/korea as they do in eu<br />
BUT<br />
it doesn't change fact that mid-wrath exp, when it peaked at 12 million, it was without any chineese player (legally at least, i know some chineese played on korean server but that was real risk), making wow profit insanely massive that it eclipsed some countries<br />

Classic servers are not Live servers, as they said in the post they could increase their capacity using tech that applies to Live, but they don't want to.<br />
nothing in what u said says that wow classic server will hold less ppl than retail, in fact it says exact opposite that servers now will hold more than in 2006<br />

where are you getting the 10k number from? the login queue? that doesn't indicate that the max cap of a server is 10k, that is talking about the login queue. two completely seperate things<br />
It indicates that when more than 10 k player log on server, u start to get a login queue<br />
and login queue is something i didn't see since Cata launch, even Legion launch didn't have a login queue for me, and I play now on Twisting Nether one of most populated servers in wow</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reality is you won't be able to play for a long time. You should expect literally 10 hour queues AT LEAST. Honestly that's lowballing it hard on Shazz EU. <br />
<br />
Also, people that are in will try to cheat the system, by adding anti afk bots (PLEASE BAN THOSE PEOPLE BLIZZ) to stay in when they sleep (not work, these guys have no life). <br />
<br />
Queue can end at 4AM. There you go, wake up in the middle of the night and play until you have to go to work.<br />
<br />
This is not just a launch day thing either. It will last for a LONG time. Fast forward a month. You still have queues. <br />
<br />
<br />
There will be no queues at launch and months after - that's what layering is for.<br />
Read the OP - the blue post mentions queues being a thing after layering is turned off.</div></div><hr />

Wrong.<br />
<br />
&quot;If all existing players on this server remain there, login queues in excess of 10,000 players are a certainty, and possibly much higher than that.&quot;<br />
<br />
They are talking about on release.<br />
<br />
The phase 2 stuff is a whole other beast to swallow. They are hoping the population has been severely reduced by that point.</div></div><hr />

So, Blizzard. Please realize that a significant amount of players are currently not subbed to WoW and will come back for Classic. I expect at least +50% more players worldwide.</div></div><hr />

just wait 6 month for announcement that due to too high ques they will keep layering.<br />

If that happens only the players are to blame. It won't. But it would be 100 percent the players fault.<br />

My prediction is this. They will turn off layering. Queues will go 20k on some servers. The players will cry. Blizzard will offer free transfers. The players will not transfer but continue to bitch and moan.</div></div><hr />

Its only cost 30 euro . I know how is to be in a dead server . I was in one of them for many years . After the Wotlk my server Genjuros EU starting to die slowly . On MoP was complity dead and I couldn't find a guild or pug some raids for relax weekend but after merge of the server everything went back to life . And when I find out I can pay 30 euro for transfer I was feel so good for leave that realm for ever and go to a more populated one . Oh yeah, let's get milked for 60-90 eu for 2-3 characters and &quot;it feels so good&quot;, yeah, nope, if you can prevent it in the first place. These &quot;only 30 euro&quot; transfer fees added up to 600+ for me after years and years of moving characters because for several expansions I would move to a guild, then move my alts to it after few months, then see it disband later down the line and since dead server and no other proper guild there could take me, hey let's transfer again. If I realized it earlier it's best to stick to high pop well developed server even if it means &quot;missing out&quot; on that super cool guild on a low pop server, I could have bought a new pc by now or at least have decent amount of funds saved towards it. Haven't moved since WOD and if they kill off my server again, I'm seriously out (which seems to be the direction since Alliance is a dying faction on retail and they are doing nothing to stop it). <br />
<br />
The prices of transfers are plain daylight robbery knowing most people have alts, it's best to keep alts together with your main for professions, sharing gold etc., and they don't offer any package transfer for a discounted price, not even mentioning some other MMOs give free transfers with a lengthy cooldown, and you don't even get that in WOW despite having to pay sub. <br />
<br />
Oh, they also don't bother to merge / connect servers after 5+ years of them being low pop, too much effort.</div></div><hr />

Not if you played back in wotlk and remember the pleads and long threads about how Blizzard should open new servers, and when they did, they became tumbleweed rolling deserts in under a year. Opening too many servers and spreading population too thin is definitely a risk. <br />
<br />
People wouldn't have this &quot;irrational fear&quot; if history didn't prove them right, and didn't show them Blizzard's complete laziness and denial about low pop server situation. What should happen is either server merges, or server shutdowns and free migration off them, instead of keeping these zombies of a server running for years. But nope.

<br />
First off, yes it is as easy as “waving a magic wand” as you so eloquently put it. They themselves even admit they COULD do it and have the power but won’t. <br />
<br />
Secondly, many of us have listened to blizzards advice on realms in the past only to be burned by it down the road when we’re stuck on a low/dying realm instead of the full one we originally chose. <br />
<br />
This has happened to me 3x<br />
<br />
So again, I will suffer long queues gladly for the first bit if it means a year or 2 down the road I’m still on THE server to be on<br />
<br />
I’ve been burned by them “suggesting” a server 3x in the past and had to pay cash to fix it. Never again. This also has happened in other mmos with servers; example, in swtor my guild and I chose Fatman only to have them suggest another server. Over that first year, Fatman became THE pvp server and all others bled out into it. For city of heroes, it was freedom server. This is human nature and happens to every MMORPG with servers, and It’s a slow, painful death that I will never suffer through again <br />
<br />
So yeah, I’m turning this down for these reasons. Plus, I’m old and attached to my names I got and won’t take the chance at losing them unless Blizz opens up more character creates limit from 3 to 5<br />
<br />
Edit: this isn’t about the realms dying in a month lol don’t be ridiculous. We are talking long term like 1-2 years. One pvp server always emerges as the alpha pvp server and everyone will flock to it whether Blizz likes t or not. It happened in retail too. There’s about 5 alpha realms in retail and 200 dead ones. Everyone migrated the top realms. I wonder why that is...<br />

Worst case scenario, they leave layering on through phase 2. They’ll have no choice. Not a big deal<br />

They only have themselves to blame by not opening more realms faster, and not letting more names be made<br />

You can achieve the same result by having queues. But they didn't want them, so they are layering.<br />

I know NEW players interested in classic who can't wait. when i made them try retail post beta, it was almost like insulting them. not one made it to 10 in retail, but all made it to 15 in beta for classic.<br />
<br />
Turns out, they are two different games that APPEAL to two different audiences. Shocking i know.<br />
<br />
Retail wow is more Diablo 3 and ARPG than classic wow/eq<br />
<br />
Classic WoW is more MMORPG/EQ<br />
<br />
Retail is typically for people who hated the old style of wow, and the people who liked the old wow typically loathe the new style of wow.<br />
<br />
There's no need for you to be such a toxic you know what about classic, all it does it show you insecurity off. You obviously are scared for the state of your retail guild/friends list moving to classic or you wouldn't be on every classic thread acting like a juvenile spouting nonsense</div></div><hr />

There will be no queues at launch, they posted just that.<br />
And there is a very big need for layering after a 50k population is spread out in different zones.<br />
<br />
They specifically state that they don't want to increase the population too much. They don't want megaservers. It's the whole point of the post. 50k population is never going to happen, even while layering is enabled.</div></div><hr />

You do realize you’ve never won a debate on this site, right? Every time you try you have 10 people telling you that you basically embarrassed yourself. <br />

Debate? I'm not trying to have a debate. No point trying to with people who have their heads shoved so far up their asses.<br />
I just tell it like it is and the Classic fanboys lose their collective shit. If anyone should be embarrassed, it's you lot.</div></div><hr />

You are basically suggesting something that Vanilla didn't have. Vanilla is known for its server tight-knit communities. By making a mega server, this will immediately go away.<br />

<br />
I have 3 irl friends who are DEEP into wow classic, but the thought of retail disgusts them. One in particular did retail post beta and couldn't even believe they were the same game before he /logged until classic. These guys still play MUDs so classics grind is insignificant to them.<br />
<br />
Don't underestimate the appeal of vanilla to bring back old, and new players, in a way that retail wow and quite frankly, no other mmorpg ever, can have.<br />
<br />
I have friends who play retail and already know they will try classic at launch but won't stay for long.<br />

Hey look, I have irrelevant anecdotal evidence as well, what a time to be alive.<br />

Despite that you're clearly being facetious and trolling; i too, have friends who love BFA and have no interest in classic. that's fine.<br />
<br />
my only issue with it is that it pretty much split our guild (that's been together since vanilla raiding) 50/50 and created a bit of animosity from the pro BFA crowd who feels classic is undercutting BFA, the guild, etc.<br />
<br />
Half of my friends basically are all in on classic until the servers close, and half are like &quot;nah&quot;. That's ok, plenty of wow for us all</div></div><hr />

You think it is as simple as waving a magic wand called &quot;tech&quot;? The game itself doesn't operate that way. I'm a big critic of Blizz, but I'm also not an idiot. There is only so much they can do with code that old. These last 2 sentences are truly facepalm level...<br />
Again, it's not a code issue.<br />
<br />
The game WORLD and GAMEPLAY is simply NOT designed to have more than XXXXX players at the same time. Not enough mobs, not enough resources to gather, NPCs not even clickable, etc. etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And yet people used to do that, back in Classic. Queues were just a part of life back then. And on patch Tuesday, when the servers were laggy and kept going down? Queues then could be even longer. Why do you think there were so many servers that they kept opening up? I can remember a stretch where all they were doing were offering free transfers off of the same two or three servers. <br />
<br />
As somebody else said - you wanted Classic? Here you go.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldn't be surprised if the transfers start out free, if nothing more than to alleviate the population imbalance. They have a precedent for this</div></div><hr />
