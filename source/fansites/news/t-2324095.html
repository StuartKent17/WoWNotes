World of Warcraft Novel - Before the Storm<br />
Christie Golden is writing (https://twitter.com/ChristieGolden/status/922188708119379968) another WoW book! Before the Storm will release on May 15, 2018. The book may have been previously titled &quot;Lightning Crashes (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/october/lightning.jpg)&quot;.<br />
<br />

<br />
An all-new, official tie-in novel to Blizzard Entertainmentâ€™s critically acclaimed World of Warcraft, from New York Times bestselling author Christie Golden<br />
<br />
Taking place after the climactic events of Shadows of Argus, World of Warcraft: Before the Storm tells the story of what awaits the heroes of the Horde and the Alliance in the wake of their struggle against the demonic Burning Legion.<br />

Patch 7.3 - Character Races<br />
This weekend there has been lots of excitement in the Expansion Hype Thread (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2249901-Official-Patch-8-0-Speculation-thread/page982?p=47647131#post47647131) about the addition of entries to the ChrRaces database file. <br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 7.3 added entries to the file for the Nightborne, Highmountain Tauren, Void Elves, and Lightforged Draenei.<br />
Many of the races in this file are playable character races, but some are just NPCs, such as the Naga, Vrykul, Tuskarr, and others.<br />
The last NPC race was added to this database during Wrath of the Lich King.<br />
All four entries have a character select screen background set.<br />
None of the new races are used in-game on a creature except Lightforged Draenei.<br />
All four entries are flagged as being unplayable, set to a Neutral faction, and have reputations linked to existing reputations in the game. <br />
There are no entries specifying race-class combinations for these new races. <br />
Data in other linked files are not consistent with being playable races. <br />
The data left behind is not consistent with something complete that has been intentionally hidden. It is possible that we are seeing a work in progress.<br />
Patch 7.3 added an additional model related file to allow models to have bones used for customization but share animations with other models. <br />
In Patch 7.3.2, the Lightforged Draenei and Draenei are the only models in the game to have this new file. <br />
TL;DR: There is a chance we are seeing the groundwork being laid for playable subraces, but we will probably have to wait until BlizzCon for confirmation of sub-races. <br />
Maybe Mag'har Orcs, Dark Iron Dwarves, and other (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/410581357136330752) sub-races finally got bumped up the priority list (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/402859789283110912)! <br />

Build of the Month - October 2017<br />
Each month or so we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
All of the parts on this page are Amazon affiliate links. When you purchase your parts through them it helps support the site!<br />

<br />
<br />
This month<br />
New CPUs from Intel have been released but are proving challenging to actually find in stock. If you aren't in a hurry to build, it is worth waiting for next month when stock should improve for these new CPUs. They will require a new motherboard as well. We will update our build list with the 8600K and other Coffee Lake CPUs when stock improves. <br />
<br />
The current SSD prices (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/september/ssdgraph.gif) are fairly flat right now, with most SSDs under $0.50 per gigabyte when on sale.<br />
<br />
Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D15 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L7UZMAK?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00L7UZMAK). <br />
<br />
Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or streaming, you do not need the 7700K and would get more performance from spending that money elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date.<br />

Subrace Fan Art<br />
Shoc put together some nice subrace mockups on the forum (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1415502-Sub-Race-Photoshop-Mockups?) back in 2013. Keep in mind this is just fan art!<br />

When they introduce sub races, I'd guess that is an extensible feature. That means they can and most probably will add more sub races in the future, e.g. 9.0, 10.0, ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
That would make sense. Also new starting grounds with high probability to starting as high level toon, since you don't want to level up your Lightforged Draenei in the vanilla content. <br />
Perfect.<br />
<br />
What bothers me is what we get with the sub-races besides the looks. Don't get me wrong, I don't give s**** about new look. This may be a nice feature for transmog fans, but for regular players I would count on something like path of the titans with cusomization depending on the subrace. Minor difference, but you choose two ways, just like crucible works in 7.3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure about that. In the past when discussing the idea, they seemed more intent on tying them into gameplay somehow and making them &quot;unlockable.&quot;<br />
<br />
My instinct is that they would probably each have some kind questline / scenario and campaign, similar to the artifact weapon acquisition quests and order hall scenarios, which will unlock the subrace. Completing let's you change for free (have to be the same base race), with later changes costing gold. If you do a boost you can probably unlock them immediately and start as that race, jumping right into a tutorial version of the scenario.<br />
<br />
But maybe not. Guess we'll see.</div></div><hr />

Draenor orcs are just different skinned orcs, maybe they'll add extra customisation to allow it? Same with the Dark Iron and tattoos for wildhammer.<br />
<br />
I'd rather not see any more elves and how the bugger will they suddenly turn highmountain tauren from neutral to horde? I really hope there's going to be stories in game to explain all this crap, if it happens, which it might not.</div></div><hr />

Yes I did, different situation though, the nightborne for example share too many animations with the night elves, they don't have proper facial animations and their options for customization are laughably small, like female tauren choices of customization small, they'll need a lot of work if they're to become playable and be up to the standards of the other playable models.<br />
<br />
I'd rather see Vrykul than more bloody elves, the vrykul, at least the males have fully functioning models on par with player models, the females simply need facial animations added since they don't currently have any and poof, job done.</div></div><hr />

At the very very minimum, they need to add existing skin color change to barber, some races can (fur), but most can't change without paying right now.<br />

Seeing how you can change faces, I don't see why skin color would be a problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know that, still silly to lock out 1 option. <br />
<br />
Especially since there's like special skins for like DH/DK.<br />
<br />
Only reason right now is $, and I think that's fine for Gender/Race/Faction swaps as that's vastly different then a simple color.<br />
<br />
And I don't mean change from green to brown orc. Just like Lightgreen to Darkgreen or whatever is possible now. <br />
<br />
Like really, there's a sun, changing a white to tan human/dwarf isnt too crazy :D<br />
<br />
Sub-race, they can do anything, questline/cooldown/paid/whatever. That's completely different. <br />

Personally I hope Sub-race is Barber shop with a cooldown, or currency attainable in-game.</div></div><hr />

I don't think that would happen, i think they are more likely to add somethings such as rep gain tokens that increases the rep you get for so much time. Possibly even gear box's that have chance of rare pets/mounts and current gear. I just can't see blizzard putting a paywall between that sort of player customization.</div></div><hr />

Neither of those things will happen. They are quite aware of the backlash that would take place should they go down that road if nothing else. Just look at what happened to transmog items on the store, or when they were planning on adding the Grove Warden to the store in WoD.</div></div><hr />

IDK think they are sort of different as not permanent such as a skin that will be seen all the time. <br />

You can transfer gold these days into account balance. So they could use that to justify it.</div></div><hr />

Justify =/= the backlash wouldn't be too huge to handle. I'm called &quot;fanboy&quot; by shits on these forums regularly and I'd be seriously pissed off should Blizzard take that route. Mounts and pets are one thing, we have those in spades from in-game sources. Lootboxes awarding unique things + relevant gear though? Locking an expansion feature like Subraces behind it? Nah.</div></div><hr />

I always thought if they were ever going to add sub-races it would have to be as a main expansion feature and if these leaks hold any truth it seems that's finally coming true. The character select backgrounds are probably the most telling part. The seeming neutrality of these races is strange though, Draenei being in the Horde would make little sense while Tauren in the Alliance does make some, but I believe these to be sub-races with the Nightborne being the Night Elven sub-race and Void Elves being the Blood Elven counterpart. Some major lore needs to happen with Alleria before that makes sense though. Maybe it'll happen in the book.<br />
<br />
Also Before the Storm is clearly leading into the South Seas expansion, finally. I was always in support of Nagas as a playable race but I doubt it'll happen now that they're going to be the expansion villain and probably create a huge storm in an attempt to drown the world.</div></div><hr />

I hope they're not neutral. I can't see Lightforged Draenei walking around in Orgrimmar, it's too unfitting. Same for Highmountain Tauren walking around in Stormwind.</div></div><hr />

LOL, every little breadcrumb before expansion reveals for the last 3 expansions was &quot;proof of the South Seas expansion!&quot; I remain skeptical, especially after one of the lead devs said that they've tried to pencil out the idea, but it's never worked. I can't remember when, but I think it was one of the discussions/interviews after the meeting with that pirate server's people. <br />
<br />
I'd lean more towards Kul Tiras and such being the focus, but the whole &quot;we ride around in boats like pirates&quot; thing? I just don't think it's gonna happen. I don't get why this &quot;South Seas&quot; thing is such a unicorn, anyway, nothing about it really sounds that cool or fun.</div></div><hr />

WoW is amazing on an Ultra wide, it is the single biggest change you can make to the look and feel of the game. Your Unicorn build is also lacking. If someone wants to play WoW at Ultra+ it takes an incredible system. I run an i9-7900x w/ 2 1080 Tis in a full custom water loop and still can't max everything while pushing the render to 200% at 3440x1440. For Unicorn it should be something that is what someone would get when they want bleeding edge of possibility with current tech, price be damned, not a mediocre build. Just my 2 cents.<br />
<br />
Edit: Forgot storage and RAM. Samsung 960 Evos not plain old SATA. 32 GB at least of G.skill or Corsair or any other top brand of Memory at 3200Mhz. I also wouldn't recommend a 7900x for gaming, I have one for other reasons. At least a 7700k though since WoW is rather CPU heavy. an 8700k would probably be the best right now without going to x299.</div></div><hr />

Why 200%? Try 100 for best graphics.</div></div><hr />

Get an used Xeon E5 (2011 Socket). Or a new i3 (because of hyperthreading). Or a AMD Ryzen 3. They are cheaper and much better!<br />
<br />
I am pretty sure there is some massive bias here. Month after month AMD is not mentioned. Both on the CPU and GPU side.<br />
<br />
480/580 are on par with the 1060.<br />
<br />
CPU wise ryzen destroys intel when it comes to price for performance. The only time intel should be considered is if you are going to be putting a 1070/1080 in your machine. At that point go for a 6700k or better.<br />
<br />
It drives me nuts seeing these &quot;builds of the month&quot; but it just boils down to clear bias.</div></div><hr />
