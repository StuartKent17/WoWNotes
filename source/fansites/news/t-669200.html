<br />
A Tribute to Dedicated Insanity<br />
Here's the breakdown. <br />
<br />
You can use:<br />
Any item below item level 245.<br />
The item level 245 set pieces that drop from 25-player Trial of the Crusader but also appear in the 10-player Tribute Chest.<br />
Any gear that drops in 10-player Trial of the Crusader or Trial of the Grand Crusader, including item level 245 Trial of the Grand Crusader drops and item level 258 cloaks from the 10-player Tribute Chest<br />
Any item level 245 items purchased with Badges of Triumph.<br />
Any item level 245 Bind on Equip item, including crafted pieces.<br />
<br />
You cannot use:<br />
Any item level 245 item not included above (primarily Bind on Pickup drops from 25-player Trial of the Crusader, but also notably Valâ€™anyr).<br />
Any item over item level 245 except for the 10-player Tribute cloak.<br />
Any higher item level loot introduced in future patches (25 player Onyxia 245s, Icecrown loot in the future, etc.) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/12/19820876298-a-tribute-to-dedicated-insanity.html))<br />

Instance Attunements<br />
Attunements tended to cause more frustration than benefit so we have aimed to put the story parts into optional quests and allow players to have easier access to the dungeons. I don't remember when heading to Onyxia anybody being excited to help someone do the attunement again. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/12/19820417161-bwl--will-we-ever-see-a-raid-like-it-again.html))<br />
<br />
Amount of tanks needed in a raid<br />
We think we can design better encounters that generally take 1-3 tanks in 25-player content and 1-2 in 10-player content. There will probably be exceptions from time to time, such as the occasional caster tank (Maulgar and Razuvious perhaps).<br />
<br />
It's very easy to get burned out on raiding, and we think having fights that all felt the same would contribute to that. That goes as far as comparing raid tiers. We don't want it to be &quot;Here's the Patchwerk fight. Here's the council fight. Oh, interesting, they switched the lots-of-adds fight to position 3 this time.&quot; ToC is fairly small as instances go, so you're not going to get the diversity that you do in larger raids. Heck, the Eye of Eternity is one boss with no trash. There is no way to make that a typical fight with a sample size of one.<br />
<br />
We want you to approach every fight differently, and that includes shifting people around to different roles. Sometimes you need more healers and sometimes you need less. Sometimes the casters have to handle the adds and sometimes the melee have to be on interrupt duty. Sometimes you need to split the group up. Sometimes your OTs have to go dps since the fight only requires one tank.<br />
<br />
It only gets to be a problem, in our minds, if the OT is such a liability on single-tank fights that she gets swapped out for another rogue or whatever. That has happened in the past in the history of WoW. It doesn't seem to be happening too much these days. All of the tanking classes can do much higher damage in a tanking spec with dps gear than they used to be able to do, and there is always dual-spec if that isn't enough for you. (The truth is also that very few fights only ever require a single tank.)<br />
<br />
It's awesome so many players are interested in the tanking role, but no, we're never going to promise that every encounter will require 4 tanks. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/19820877680-cataclysm-raids-requiring-23-tanks-.html))<br />

Reasons behind the changes to Gnaw's cooldown<br />
Yes. To spin an infamous old phrase of mine, being kited forever isn't fun. However, casters do need to actually be able to cast sometimes.<br />
<br />
We don't find the argument that a longer cooldown makes the ability easier to use compelling.<br />
<br />
We also don't buy that under-represented specs should be allowed to have frustratingly overpowered abilities. I'm not saying Gnaw falls into this category, but there are a couple of posts above slipping into the &quot;So what, as long as we aren't at 10% of Arena representation balance doesn't matter&quot; camp.

Beast Mastery's popularity<br />
BM is actually more popular than MM among level 80s. BM is also the most popular secondary spec, though maybe it could just be to play Pokemon with Spirit Beasts. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19820327060-hunter-mechanics-questions.html))<br />

Weapon Swapping with the new 3.2.2 Master Poisoner (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/58410/master-poisoner/)<br />
There is some theorycrafting that suggests swapping weapons like this will be a net dps increase. It's not a huge dps increase, and the conditions in which the simulation were done were extremely generous.<br />
<br />
Short story: we're not convinced ROUGES are really going to be doing this. If they end up doing it, we'll probably take some action because we agree it's a clunky mechanic. In the meanwhile, there are some legit and slightly less clunky opportunities to swap weapons and we'd rather not make those collateral damage if we don't have to. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19820877709-assassinationweapon-swap-gimmick.html))<br />
<br />
Subtlety spec<br />
<br />
Now, we do want Subtlety to be more attractive. All of the pure dps classes have a spec that isn't as popular as the others. Mages may be the closest because at least Frost has a viable PvP use, but there are also plenty of mages who want to be able to use Frost in end-game PvE too.<br />
<br />
Subtlety (and Frost for that matter) are specs focused around utility. The problem is that players understandably nearly always choose damage over utility for raiding and often choose utility over damage for PvP, unless the damage is really high or the utility just doesn't cut it for some reason.<br />
<br />
What we are talking about doing is sharing more of the utility among other specs, or the core class, so that there aren't &quot;utility trees.&quot; To do that though, we have to make the way the different specs do damage different enough so that players might choose a play-style preference over highest damage. This is particularly challenging for rogues, who have a history of giving up a preferred spec or play style for one with a sub 1% dps increase.<br />
<br />
I think we are closest with the Arcane vs. Fire mage specs at the moment. They play a little differently, which goes beyond just the type of magic damage they do. While Fire might still do the highest damage overall, Arcane is close enough and plays different enough that even competitive players don't feel stupid for playing that spec. There are a lot more Arcane mages out there than I think a lot of players assume.<br />
<br />
That is harder with rogues. &quot;I'm the sneaky one&quot; doesn't translate into sustained raid dps. Assassination feels like it emphasizes poisons more and Combat feels like it emphasizes weapons more, so we're a little closer there. Subtelty needs a stronger yet damage-oriented niche.<br />
<br />
HaT, sadly, is not a niche. HaT has scaling problems. It's appropriate for a 5-player group, but gets too in larger groups with all of their raid buffs. We don't want HaT to be the one talent that pushes players into Subtlety. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19820517131-dead-tree--as-intended.html))</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Before the grab, the OT on arhavon (Who's tanking koralon) taunted archavon so that he was second on threat (druid gained threat on archavon an few seconds later). Than, as you know, archavon grabs whoever is tanking and switches to whoever is second in his threat list, which is the bear tank now :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Looks like around 18-19</div></div><hr />

Yep, 1 healer, 1 tank, and the rest of the dps looks like. Must have some gewd dps through to get him down before koralon / archavon enrage :)</div></div><hr />

Emalon was tanked in his place.<br />
1 tank, 1 healer and 4 dps went over to kill Emalon, while the 2 other tanks and 2 healers were on Koralon and Archavon.<br />

<br />
You only really need to worry about the 5Min Hard Enrage on Archavon from you engaged him you have about 5 mins before he enrages, Koralon on the other hand does not have a Hard enrage timer but instead have a soft enrage since he stacks Burning Fury that Increases damage dealt by 5% each time it stacks (Every 20Seconds) but that should not be a big problem if you got strong tanks and healers.</div></div><hr />

And still a caster can't cast with a rogue on him/her. So the reason of changing gnaw that was mentioned in the blue post is just bs. &quot;casters need to be able to cast sometimes&quot;, can't he come up with something better?<br />

Sanctified Retribution	Rank 1<br />
Increases the damage caused by Retribution Aura by 50% and all damage caused by friendly targets affected by ANY of your Auras is increased by 3%. <br />
so no need for bm as long as the pally uses a aura</div></div><hr />

<br />
you can't cast with any melee on you (hi@kick/mindfreeze/pummel)<br />
GC is talking about gap closers, and DK already have two very strong ones regardless of specc: chains of ice and deathgrip plus range silence. and they think that gnaw is a bit over the top at 30sek cd, especially considering your casts are getting pushed back all the time by the ghul autoattacking</div></div><hr />

Wow, I wasn't aware they nerfed Eye of Eternity. I completely remember a trash phase. Hmm.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It's awesome so many players are interested in the tanking role, but no, we're never going to promise that every encounter will require 4 tanks. <br />
<br />
<br />
People are not &quot;interested&quot; in the tanking role. They are interested in playing their character in raids and there is only so much room for non-tank melee dps and tanks are always in demand. The result is people that could care less about tanking are tanking in raids.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
BM is actually more popular than MM among level 80s. BM is also the most popular secondary spec, though maybe it could just be to play Pokemon with Spirit Beasts. <br />
<br />
<br />
BM is the most played by gold farmers. Gold farmers are 80. They therefore spec BM for easy farming and account in this &quot;BM is more popular&quot; crap. The truth is that when you are a raider you go after the highest dps spec regardless of what it is unless you bring a much needed raid buff otherwise. I don't buy that BM is more popular than MM in a serious context among level 80 raiders.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daez</div><div class="date">2009-09-18, 07:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe I'm a jerk for thinking this but 10 man content when you over gear it insanely is not an &quot;achievement&quot;. Hell, you could solo heal Archavon in level 70 gear in 10 man if the rest of the people weren't idiots. All raiding content is balanced on the backs of healers in this game. When someone does this on 25 man where Koralon can one shot whirl anyone not capped off completely at the time that doesn't have at least 22k hp then I'll be &quot;impressed&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Than, as you know, archavon grabs whoever is tanking and switches to whoever is second in his threat list, which is the bear tank now :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Archavon also hits like a 1 year old. Hell, we used to do him in 10 man with only one tank and just heal the dps through the throws. Its not like he does that much damage to worry about in the first place on 10 man.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Emalon has to be last since you need full dps on the overcharged adds, so stressing the fight even longer wont do you any good.<br />
Altho a good geared tank can solotank it tho, which i gues they did.<br />
<br />
Archavon has a hard enrage, so he has to be second.<br />
Koralon is the only one without a real enrage timer, his damage just increases overtime, which can be out healed.<br />
<br />
<br />
So Koralon,Archavon,Emalon is at least the &quot;easy&quot; way to go.</div></div><hr />

I'm really interested what people have to say about the gnaw changes or BM changes but they are mix in with guilds progress and these posts are just pages and pages of 'grats'. Nothing against the top guilds but I don't understand why all the news is mixed together. Maybe I'm the only one who feels this way or this would be the norm already i guess.<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe you could use class specific forums to talk about those subjects. These front page posts aren't exactly the place for debate and discussion imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a mana intensive encounter, yes, but it's still a 7min fight. If a healer's supposed to be at 0% by the end of the fight, Illidan would be simply impossible.</div></div><hr />

When someone does this on 25 man where Koralon can one shot whirl anyone not capped off completely at the time that doesn't have at least 22k hp then I'll be &quot;impressed&quot;.<br />

You sir are being ridiculous this achievment in 25 man is the most challenging PvE one of this partch -.-... &quot;impressed&quot;... ridiculous people are ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you talk about Archavon only...<br />
you forgot the fact that 2 tanks stay on archavon + koralon tanking with 18-20 stacks.<br />
you also froget that only 6 people went to down Emalon (1 tank, 1 healer, 4dps) which means you need insane dps on the adds, insane healing on the tank and raid from 1 person. (you should try 6 manning Emalon once, and see what I mean)<br />
<br />
I wasn't there on the kill, but I'm pretty impressed that they managed to do this, since it's hard even if you overgear it.<br />
it's an achievement which doesn't count as progression, but it's an achievement which is made for fun, and doest involve the &quot;10 man instance = cleared with 10 man gear)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
woot ! Vala'nyr shield absorbs damage !<br />
that's why the whirl does lower damage.</div></div><hr />

Respect your Classics man, remember them. :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Posokhov</div><div class="date">2009-09-19, 08:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes. To spin an infamous old phrase of mine, being kited forever isn't fun. However, casters do need to actually be able to cast sometimes.<br />
<br />
We don't find the argument that a longer cooldown makes the ability easier to use compelling.<br />
<br />
We also don't buy that under-represented specs should be allowed to have frustratingly overpowered abilities.<br />
<br />
So, does this mean rogue nerfs are coming, since they're able to lock down casters better than DKs? Or is this just a &quot;It's broken if it's not a rogue doing it&quot; thing again?</div></div><hr />
