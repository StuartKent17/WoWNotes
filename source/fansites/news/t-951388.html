I’m sure adding a trigger at 10% HP to despawn a few mobs kept the entire raid development team busy all week.</div></div><hr />

I dont care if it was 1 man hour only, it was 1 man hour too much. They should not change something because some DK finds a smart way of beating LK solo, this was not a fix it was just a change of something that was already perfect. The instance is designed for 10 and/or 25 people so if you decide to solo it and want your loot you better make sure you kill those valkyrs.<br />
<br />
Yes it was probably a 'fix' done quickly but it shows that blizzard got their priorities wrong, they could have fixed trash farming in FL by letting mobs run 40% faster so that shamans cant outrun them with ghost wolf form but instead blizzard decided to fix something inside ICC HERP DERP.</div></div><hr />

It doesnt matter if it only took 15 minutes there are still things out there a lot more important such as shamans farming trash packs in Firelands. They can litterally become wow millionaires with just a few hours of trash farming and all you would have to do to prevent this is change the run speed of the two mobs from 100% to 140%</div></div><hr />

Prolly more, but many maybe just don't care about posting a video or talking about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First if shamans are becoming MILLIONAIRES farming FL trash, well good for them. They haven't had any love from this game in a long time. Somehow I doubt that's the case. <br />
<br />
Second, you're just whining about something that doesn't matter. They fixed it - so what. I'm sure the decision they faced was not &quot;fix all current content&quot; or &quot;make a tiny almost inconsequential ICC change.&quot; <br />
<br />
Honestly I'm pretty sure the next hero class is Whiner and most of the people on here are going to roll several....</div></div><hr />

In the last 10%, LK doesn't have an aggro table (I don't think). Either that or Terenas has aggro. Either way, nobody is tanking at the end and the valks carried the dk off the platform.</div></div><hr />

Maybe they acknowledge the feat he did and noticed the bug, besideas no point complaing i bet they just did a copy/paste on some code BAM DONE.<br />
<br />
quit your whining i think the fact he solod with valkrs is an achievement enough even if they didnt die and it was self gratitude mionelol did it for not loot so stop having a moan about it and its no like it has any affect on your either hell im enjoing the fact people can farm firelands trash, more epics = lower value = easier on people.</div></div><hr />

They grab you after you get resurrected since there is no longer an aggro table. So you have to sit there and wait ten minutes while Fordring hits LK for ticks of damage at a time, then release after LK gets killed, run back, and get the loot.<br />

Always been number 1 by far on that server. Finished Sunwell before the big 30% nerf. Top 100 for Sunwell (I think), top 100ish for most of WOTLK (except ICC when the gm quit and they couldn't recruit because the gm had all admin rights....) etc.<br />

<br />
Ascendance has never once disbanded or stopped raiding since it was formed about 5-6 years ago. I was there raiding for over 3 years from Tier 5 till I quit the game a few months ago and it has never disbanded. Yes, a lot of new members have joined between ICC and now as many old members have gone casual (although many remain in the guild even if it's with different character names) or quit the game but that's what happens to most guilds. You have to keep recruiting if you want to be able to continue to raid.<br />
<br />
As for them being cocky or arrogant, these are simply the same comments that any decent guild hears from idiots who probably don't even know any of the members and have probably had no interaction with any of them. I read the same things in chat channels every day and I know i'd never been anything but helpful when asked for advice and polite when in pugs despite that not being true of many people I played with. The worst thing anyone has ever been honestly able to say is that they didn't get a reply when they whispered a member (only true of a handful of members).... but that's because some people get tired of answering the same questions that someone could easily find out on MMO or any other forum if they weren't lazy. I suspect you are just repeating what other idiots have said with no actual evidence.... (a common trait among wow players unfortunately).<br />
<br />
It probably isn't the hardest meta achievement in the world. It's a lot smaller than older meta's and other than the hard modes, none of the achievements sound that difficult with the the exception of &quot;do a barrell roll&quot; which sounds like it could be tricky. I'm sure other guilds could have got the world 1st if they had gone for it but I guess they preferred to farm hard modes for gear and put 100% into heroic rag BUT it's still a world 1st and still something to be proud of for a guild which isn't one of the world known 1s.</div></div><hr />

Especially guilds who have killed Ragnaros Hardmode already. The question is: Is it a really difficult to do the achievements if you have killed the first 6 Hardmodes, or is this guild simply the first that prefers doing the achievement instead of farming gear for Ragnaros Hardmode? From reading the descriptions the achievements don't seem to be very difficult if you do them on normal-difficulty.<br />
<br />
They probably were as surprise as you were that no one else had gotten the achievement as well, saw that they were out of the race for a world first kill so they opted to concentrate on the achievements instead.<br />
<br />
However, I'm not surprised it took this long. Look at how long it took anyone to get the final achievement in Bastion of Twilight, it was about 4-5 months before that one was achieved.<br />

lolz @ ICC hotfix So blizz saw the video :o<br />
<br />
Yeah, wrong fix in my mind. Should made them attack a tank when they're the only ones left, oh well. It's not awful that they allow bosses to be solo'd, but I don't think they should go out of their way to make them soloable.</div></div><hr />

It was still doable though, just had to be done on the first attempt as we did.</div></div><hr />

Well PH2 is when they should grab people.<br />
But if you solo it it doesn't target the tank.</div></div><hr />

Speaking as a Software Engineer, when you get a new person on the team, you typically assign them a task that is: a) easy to fix and b) low enough priority that if something breaks as a result of the fix you are not impacting tons of users. Doing so you give the new person a chance to get their feet wet in the system so they can make changes to bigger issues. The change to the LK encounter certainly fits these parameters. <br />
<br />
Of course it is also likely that Daelo (or another of the dungeon designers) saw the video and said &quot;Hey that's an odd bug, I can take 5 minutes and fix this&quot;. In the grand scheme of things, either of these is not really impacting their schedule.</div></div><hr />

Does not matter if 75% of the guild are not the old ppl from back in the days, they where number 1 on Alonsus since i transfered to that realm at the start of TBC. They could have been nr1 before that, i don't know. Point is they where the top Alonsus guild back then and still are. <br />

Totally justified facepalm u did there btw. :')<br />

They should not change something because some DK finds a smart way of beating LK solo, this was not a fix it was just a change of something that was already perfect. The instance is designed for 10 and/or 25 people so if you decide to solo it and want your loot you better make sure you kill those valkyrs.You are very wrong here.Blizzard showed many times they do care about players soloing some content.</div></div><hr />

A drake or hippogryph lol? Well if it were one of those two, I'll grant ya, it would be pretty ugly by that standard.</div></div><hr />

Second, you're just whining about something that doesn't matter. They fixed it - so what. I'm sure the decision they faced was not &quot;fix all current content&quot; or &quot;make a tiny almost inconsequential ICC change.&quot; <br />
<br />
Honestly I'm pretty sure the next hero class is Whiner and most of the people on here are going to roll several....<br />

This is so true !</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raegwyn</div><div class="date">2011-08-06, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guess is that the hotfix was already applied in when Raegwyn did it. If you watch my video, you'll see that I *do* taunt the LK, but it doesn't matter I get thrown away regardless:p<br />
On his vid, he gets grabbed, but the Val'kyrs release him instantly.<br />
<br />
Blizzard usually doesn't list hotfixes exactly when they go live (espcially for minor hotfixes such as this one), and they can have a few days of difference, so that wouldn't be too surprising.<br />
<br />
im pretty sure the hotfix wasnt done when i did him because they write that the valkyr will despawn when he reaches 10% so i think they will despawn like the vile spirits while the roleplaying part happens, what they didnt for me<br />
the only difference i can see is that they grabbed me and let me instantly fall down while lk had the debuff of my taunt what made me to the tank<br />
but anyway it doesnt really care</div></div><hr />
