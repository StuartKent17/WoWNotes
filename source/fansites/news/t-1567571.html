<br />
most likely because of the char wipe and will have to lvl to 100 for the third time.meaning every time there is a char wipe our chars &quot;die&quot; and are &quot;reborn&quot; the next build hence the phrasing circle of life</div></div><hr />

I had started to make some progress on my Garrison, and was finally going to get to test out some Level 2 structures. Is it just me or has this Beta had an unusually high number of wipes? Second one just in my short time testing. Though to be fair, the leveling has proven smoother each successive time so far. Without checking, can you do free faction change on a character in Beta? Figure I'd level other faction, but would really prefer to use my main.</div></div><hr />

I don't know what happened to monk, but most changes reflect the flat +20% damage from the perks. So sorry, no buffs :)<br />

Yeah it's a different model, but my first thought was that it's the same. It definitely looks a bit like a green version of it with a bit different-looking fur.<br />

I had to read the name of the picture to make sure it's actually supposed to be a wolf pup. It's cute, but it didn't look like a wolf pup to me. And why why why is it green? What have the orcs done to the poor thing?</div></div><hr />

They can't balance the class around the broken Sudden Death, but the really should fix that first since they've known for weeks that it's broken.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I fully expect probably 8-10+ more of these tuning passes before live and some major warrior nerfs will probably come. If I were a warrior I wouldn't get my hopes up of anything close to the current state going live. If it doesn't come, they'll be the the pretty clear fotm class for wod. I suppose it would be a cheap way to add more tanks though, a lot of bad ones, but it would be more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
100k is way overpriced. I mean the bike lost and now Blizzard is going out of their way to appeal to a new and younger player base. These people will not have 100k to blow on a mount. I been playing almost 10 years and only have 250k banked but I also refuse to play the AH and buy what I want when I need or want it. I spend the gold to make my Jeweled Black Panther mount. Didn't agree with having to make the other four again so I didn't. <br />
<br />
If Blizzard was looking for a gold sink. This wasn't the place to put it and I feel bad for anyone in advance who pays for one.</div></div><hr />

Agree 100%. For a faction specific mount that is way too steep. They should have just put it on the cash shop. A price this huge is just... I got no words for it.</div></div><hr />

Alliance really shouldn't be getting any sort of mount IMO so this will keep it rare. Its funny though how people think 100k is nothing. It is a lot of gold no matter how you look at it. Of course the people that play the auction house religiously come out to say it's pennies. <br />
<br />
Inb4 &quot;I spend maybe 10 minutes at the AH every day and I have gold capped&quot;</div></div><hr />

No it isn't. Watch your mouth too.<br />
<br />
Ok mage wiped, was not enjoying. Time for new class this weekend.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How is it not? The most expensive mount in the current game is the Grand Expedition Yak, and that<br />
one is absurdly overpriced as well. It's only arguably justifiable feature was having a reforger, but<br />
evidently that's leaving upon WoD, so it's nothing more than an overglorified and overpriced mount<br />
that does the same as the Traveler's Mammoth does. Yet at the very least, it still comes with vendors.<br />
<br />
So a 120k mount with lots of stuff vs. a 100k mount with absolutely nothing. Yes, that's completely<br />
fair and justified. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Watch your mouth too.<br />
<br />
Until you have actual authority, don't presume to tell me how to speak thank you very much.</div></div><hr />

I'm horde..and got mine for free. Doesnt matter that everyone else is riding it, the fact is that i got it for free while you alliance have to pay for it. Hilarious!</div></div><hr />

For a faction specific mount that is way too steep. They should have just put it on the cash shop. A price this huge is just... I got no words for it.<br />
<br />
Hmm pay real money or imaginary money, think I know what I'd rather do :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Calm down guys its just an optional mount, the other version of which you can get for free, doesn't matter if you don't play horde the option is there easily for you to obtain it. Its a bit harder for a primary horde player to obtain the other factions version.<br />
<br />
Not that I really give a shit about either mount I only ride my brown kodo anyway.</div></div><hr />

You don't get it, do you? Mount collectors who collect ALL they can don't give a crap - they have all the gold they need to afford any price up to gold cap. Others who don't collect all, have two choices: a) have a mount everybody own and therefor not being to show off it, or b) gather some gold and have moderatly rare mount to inflict jelousy over their peers.<br />
To put it in numbers:<br />
http://www.guildox.com/go/g.aspx?a=30<br />
297 Reins of the Grand Expedition Yak - same price level.<br />
1 Subdued Abyssal Seahorse - given to everybody who quested through Vajshir.<br />
So... What value does the mount own by literary EVERYONE will have?</div></div><hr />

Guess the community is so anti-competitive they even cant take a chopper contest as it is.</div></div><hr />

You really should have read my post...<br />
I'll get my mount, so I did not lose. And it would not matter what the price will be - it will be in the game and it will be easily acsessable. But yeah, if you have hard on for another free mount and don't care for it's value who am I to defy you of pleasure - feel free to celebrate, bro.</div></div><hr />
