Get to Your Choppa! - Claiming Your Mount<br />
The Horde chopper is on its way, and you need to log in now to claim it!<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/july/azChopper.jpg <br />
<br />
Your votes for Azeroth Choppers were counted, and one factionâ€™s war cry roared loudest: the Horde bike will now be turned into a mount in World of Warcraft! Anyone who logs in to the game between now and September 30, 2014 will automatically have their account flagged to receive the Horde chopper upon the release of the upcoming Warlords of Draenor expansion. Everyone can (and should!) claim their chopper by logging in now, but as a reminder, only your Horde characters will be able to mount up and take it for a ride.</div></div><hr />

Not really, I'm pretty sure it'll count towards the total mounts for Alliance also, just wont be usable on Alliance toons, similar to if you aren't a tailor you cant use the tailoring carpets but they still are listed, etc.</div></div><hr />

It was a vote left completely up to the fans and the Horde bike won. They said from the start that only the winning bike would be added and only for the winning faction. How does that favor the Horde again?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard knew from the beginning that Horde would win, as did anyone who pays attention to the community.<br />
Horde is always more vocal and more involved in faction-based community events, see the battlecry mosaic years ago.<br />
<br />
So really, it is partially Blizzards fault for know this was going to be the outcome and still deciding that introducing a brand new unique model mount to one faction based on a popularity contest was a good idea.<br />
<br />
<br />
Its easy to make a Horde character... instead of complaining, maybe just make such one? :P<br />
<br />
Hard to do that when you don't have any character slots to make a Horde character.<br />
Also pretty stupid to expect people to make a character on the opposite faction from their friends, guild, etc.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Anyone who logs in to the game between now and September 30, 2014 will automatically have their account flagged to receive the Horde chopper upon the release of the upcoming Warlords of Draenor expansion.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Fantastic, horde voting smashed alliance voting as everyone said it would have, even if the alliance bike was vastly superior the horde bike would have won.<br />
<br />
Not impressed about not getting the alliance bike, and if i have to end up paying for it which wouldnt suprise me in the slightest Blizz can go F themselves. with the vast amounts of money rolls they have</div></div><hr />

just Create a lvl 1 horde char then you're flagged and will get the mount once WoD is released :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
not rly..its 2 months, which I can guarantee will fly past!<br />
<br />
Alliance players generally have more alts. Just because there are more Alliance characters does not mean there are more players. Horde outnumber Ally on active accounts, hands down.<br />
<br />
Ally never had a shot at the bike, didn't matter what it looked like. The game is world of Hordecraft.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everyone knew from the beginning that the horde would win this. EVERYONE. So there is no way Blizz themselves didn't know this as Horde is the more popular faction. Or more vocal. Or the one with more pride and they will show up to vote. Was it done fairly by letting it be a vote? Of course. But we all knew how it would turn out. <br />
<br />
Also, having this login b/t now and September 30th is a greedy money grab on their part. They know people are unsubbed b/c of the lack of content. So basically they are saying that you have to give them $15 by 9/30 to get it (if you are taking a break from the game).<br />
<br />
Next; this is also a &quot;make our numbers look good&quot; move. This will boost up the sub numbers for this quarter some. Which is shady if you ask me.<br />

<br />
But once again; I don't care either way. The horde bike looks like it will be cool in-game. I play ally mainly but always have at least one max level horde toon per xpack so I'll be riding the bike. And I fully expect them to release the ally one at some point. But all three of those things I mentioned above seem pretty negative and to me, outweigh the positive aspect of this bike looking pretty cool.<br />

First off, you didn't have to sign in to battle.net to vote. That leaves it open to abuse. Secondly, from the looks of the official forums, many people were under the impression they were voting for the best bike - NOT which faction would be able to ride it. Which means anybody who plays Alliance who voted for the nicer looking bike screwed themselves. They wont be able to use it. Thirdly, it was a forgone conclusion before voting even began. Even if Alliance has 2% more players, the Horde has many more &quot;fans&quot; - see Blizzcon, Battle Mosaic, etc - who care about &quot;faction pride&quot; thanks to Blizzard's childish actions propping them up (like endorsing somebody who calls Alliance players &quot;fags&quot; on stage, and pissing all over the story then wondering why we're not happy with a mechano-kitten quest).

Gotta agree with you on this. I've been unsubbed for over 6 months now, and well yeah i kinda want the mount as i play horde mainly, BUT now im forced to spend money on getting a mount they said all from that facion would get for free, well for it its not &quot;free&quot; as now i have to pay just to get it, why not just flag all accounts tbh, even if they dont have a horde char, would make it soo much easier , but as you said, they want to boost the subs for this Q so it looks better. I really dont like that in any way not at all.</div></div><hr />

Because the &quot;majority&quot; are those demented sickos populating Goldshire with their ERP business, describing their female characters as being futas, some of them having two or even three male organs. Yeah, they're not true players because they're not even 90, don't PvE in meaningful ways (that is, not just using LFR for PvE progression), and same PvP wise. And they think Pet Battles was worth losing a raid tier or two.<br />

<br />
Then do something about it, instead of whining that it was rigged. If you didn't do something, it's all your fault that your faction lost. Make a campaign for your side. Set up voting bots. Make videos to vote for a side just like how the community made a massive campaign for Josh Wise to get into the NASCAR All-Star Race, and they suceeded!</div></div><hr />

Thats not quite true. Sure you can't fly with it in the new zones. But you can still use it as a ground mount + flying in all other zones.</div></div><hr />

Even if it didn't, I don't get the whole &quot;It throws off the numbers count&quot;, so many mounts removed that others have to inflate their numbers, and another example of the wolf mount for killing Garrosh before WoD, that will be removed and throw off numbers for people who didn't get it in time or are new players.<br />
<br />
The differense with those mount like kor'kron wolf and the choppa is that 1 is obtainable for both faction while the other isnt.<br />
Also there was similair things during wrath when they added achievements about how it was easier for the alliance to get the 100mount achievement than it was for the horde. So they added a horde version of Winterspring Frostsaber, the Venomhide Ravasaur, ontop of 3 normal faciton mounts for orc, undead and taurens.</div></div><hr />

The Skyreaver has been out for months, the people who bought it have already gotten use out of it.<br />

There's lots of places in the game where you can't fly. Like, every single place that's relevant in MoP is currently no-fly. Draenor will just be another one.<br />

Whether the playerbase voted for the horde is irrelevant, they shouldn't limit it to one faction only. I voted for the Alliance, I think the horde is just another shitty goblin trike with horns attached but I'd take it because it's still a new mount.<br />
<br />
The players may have voted but it's Blizzard who decided to simply reward one faction over another for choices alot of people made a decade ago.<br />
<br />
But like a number of people have said, theres no way they'll keep the alliance one out, the fact that a large faction of the player base wanted the alliance means they'll add it in at another point. You know for Â£20 so you know you've been taken for a ride. <br />

Oh please. I never even voted and was barely able to get through 1 episode before i couldn't take it anymore. I couldn't care-less about the whole Alliance VS Horde bullshit attached to this whole situation, not to mention the show itself was just typical reality TV show tier garbage. <br />
<br />
I know some people will like this mount and for those that are currently subbed and enjoying the game, congrats to them they don't have to do anything and get a mount.<br />
Still you're blind and dumb if you can't see this as an obvious ploy to get people to re-sub for Q3. With the countless other mounts in the game - anyone who isn't playing and would really re-sub JUST for this mount, shame on them. <br />

Exactly, plus I know Alliance friends that voted for the Horde bike because they liked it better. I also got a lot of my Facebook friends to vote for the Horde bike. Alliance players could have done the same.<br />

I have to admit that I wouldn't be surprised if starter accounts couldn't get flagged, therefore making players having to resub to guarantee their pass to get the bike. Would be a douchy move from Blizz but I guess is all about making money, right?<br />
<br />
Also not giving the Alliance bike makes me wonder if they'll add it in the store... THAT would be kind of a douche move.<br />

That's not even remotely close to the point, at all. The point should have been that people should vote for the style of bike they like more, and instead rewarded one faction, and the other faction wasn't awarded at all. It wouldn't exactly be a &quot;win&quot; if Alliance players voted for the Horde one, only to later realize they wouldn't even be able to use the bike (even though it was stated before the vote). They should be able to use the item they liked better, regardless of faction.</div></div><hr />

Most players I talk to, Alliance or Horde, say the Alliance bike sucks. It was downright being laughed at, and people were saying how the contest was rigged from the start with how stupid the bike looked for Alliance. Needless to say, most of the Alliance players I know voted Horde just because of how ridiculous the Alliance bike was. Nowhere in the competition did they mention that only the bike's faction would have access to it, after all. <br />
<br />
If they had been up front and honest, letting Alliance and Horde know that only the faction that wins gets access to the bike, that would have been one thing... and then there's the subbing in this quarter. That just reeks of shady business. Maybe the intended 6.0 release is around that time, but atm it just sounds like a grab for more subscribers. <br />
<br />
Interesting event, but it's being handled very poorly and is alienating, quite literally, more than half of their fan base.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
First, we want to make it clear that players globally will be able to vote for their favorite faction bikeâ€”either Alliance or Horde. Second, the bike that receives the most votes will then be made into a faction-specific-only mount and be available FREE to all players (usable when playing characters of the winning faction, of course).<br />
<br />
It's still not very fair, in my opinion. But they did clearly state it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard knew from the beginning that Horde would win, as did anyone who pays attention to the community.<br />
Horde is always more vocal and more involved in faction-based community events, see the battlecry mosaic years ago.<br />
<br />
So really, it is partially Blizzards fault for know this was going to be the outcome and still deciding that introducing a brand new unique model mount to one faction based on a popularity contest was a good idea.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hard to do that when you don't have any character slots to make a Horde character.<br />
Also pretty stupid to expect people to make a character on the opposite faction from their friends, guild, etc.<br />

Like you are? No, I play to collect mounts. Some people play for PVP or raid progression. My take on the hobby is just as legitimate as anyone's and I think that the two factions should continue having an equal mount total.<br />
<br />
In what way am I trolling? All I'm asking for is the promotional mount to count for the sake of equality. The same equality that drove them to do the Ravasaur quest for the Horde and later the 2 Worgen horses for the Alliance. There's plenty of precedent for faction equality.</div></div><hr />

Hell, I used my boosted thinger from WoD preorder for a Belf mage so I can see the mists horde story. Doesn't make me any less of a Alliance player since every other toon I own is Alliance.

Also there was similair things during wrath when they added achievements about how it was easier for the alliance to get the 100mount achievement than it was for the horde. So they added a horde version of Winterspring Frostsaber, the Venomhide Ravasaur, ontop of 3 normal faciton mounts for orc, undead and taurens.<br />

This doesn't matter anymore. In WoD the mount tab shows mounts from both factions.</div></div><hr />

Also pretty stupid to expect people to make a character on the opposite faction from their friends, guild, etc.<br />
<br />
Unless you're telling me you have 50 characters, just make a Hordie on a different server to claim the mount. Not hard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same, I voted for the Alliance bike as well cause I like it better and I have a human DK I could use it on. Oh well, Horde won, so I still get to use a cool looking bike on characters in my main faction. No big deal as the only losers here are sore losers and people who don't play both factions.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenavn</div><div class="date">2014-07-25, 06:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And if the Alliance bike had won, would all the Horde bros telling the Alliance to suck it up and quit &quot;crying&quot; be taking the loss any better? And how many of the Alliance kids, vehemently frothing about fairness would also be sticking up for the Horde bike had they lost--and surely there wouldn't be any from the Alliance descending on the Horde for belly-aching about losing a contest?<br />
The contest wasn't a bad idea in looking at the external community and fanbase of Warcraft, asking the public about which faction-themed bike looked the coolest, but when they started promising in game goodies or &quot;tangible&quot; consequences for the vote, it conjured up an unfortunate personal investment from in game Alliance/Horde players. <br />
The game is centered around divisive themes, but the community is successful because it can agree on commonly enjoying Warcraft. Creating an event to praise one faction or the other through popularity contests is constructive--because in the end it doesn't ultimately affect the playable &quot;hobby,&quot; it promotes it--however, by adding the in game incentive to &quot;win&quot; the contest, it manufactured that emotional investment and created an (ultimately insignificant) threat of permanent loss to some element that the &quot;other team&quot; would then get to tote and flaunt.<br />
To some people, it is &quot;just a promotional contest,&quot; but to others it's the loss of an in-game objective that they were powerless to obtain and unable to influence the ultimate outcome of.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sandz</div><div class="date">2014-07-25, 06:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all; As long as the mount is account bound, and I just can't use it as Alliance, I don't care. I wouldn't have used the mount either way, as I don't generally like those bikes. The voting was a disgrace though as they set them self up for abuse with it not requiring you to log in, that said I still think Horde would've won, but that doesn't make it any less of a mistake.<br />
<br />
And the back and forth on player numbers is useless and won't get you anywhere, there's more Alliance characters created, but that doesn't automatically mean there's more Alliance players in total. We are able to play both factions and have several characters on the same account, after all.<br />
<br />
All that said, I think both mounts are ugly, just give me a +1 doesn't matter if I can ride it or not, and I'm happy with this contest. Hopefully they won't do it again though.<br />
<br />
And please, do not put the Alliance bike on the store.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If Blizzard didn't want that type of rigging to happen, they could have made it so that a WoW account (non-Starter Version to prevent vote flooding) is required to vote. But since they didn't, it's safe to say that it was intended, and Horde pulled it off.<br />

Wow that is retarded I thought the Horde version comes out first or something not that all Alliance players would be completely denied a mount. <br />

The factions are already imbalanced to the point where top end guilds faction change to horde because they have an advantage.

Except then the vote doesn't come down to &quot;which bike is better&quot;, which it was originally said to be, but rather &quot;which faction do you play more&quot;. I personally liked the Horde mount better, so apparently voting for it meant 1 more vote AGAINST me even receiving a bike (because I don't play Horde). Do you not understand how stupid this is?<br />

This is fucking high school all over again with class president votes. The most popular kid wins even though they'll be the worst at student council. I'm honestly baffled that they chose to do it this way and alienate half their playerbase.</div></div><hr />

Why else would they explicitly state a time period within which your account can be flagged for the mount? Why don't they just flag all accounts as a default or just say logging in from any time after now will secure you the mount at the launch of WoD and even post-launch? Cause they intend to sell it eventually.</div></div><hr />

Even if they show the mount or not it will still be a faction inbalance with the mounts which they tried to fix for 2patches in wotlk.<br />

Wow that is retarded I thought the Horde version comes out first or something not that all Alliance players would be completely denied a mount. <br />

WOW. Who else remembers when they originally said &quot;Both factions will be able to claim the mount and ride it&quot; when they started this stupid series?<br />
<br />
Nobody remembers it because it was never said outside your ridiculous imagination.<br />

Good job, Blizzard. You coulda had my $15, but you chose to be assholes again.<br />
<br />
They made over a billion dollars last year. I'm sure they'll be drying their tears with it just thinking about your $15.</div></div><hr />

The people who donÂ´t want to play anymore wonÂ´t magically be motvated to resub because of a mount. Those who are subbed get one for free. Stop being paranoid</div></div><hr />

Fixed that for you because it is not usable for alliance characters, and since I almost never play Horde....<br />

I respect that kind of marketing PR. Great example to get engagement from your audience. <br />
<br />
I really don't get the outcry of players. People knew in advance how this would play out, winner takes all. If the alliance mount was voted best, probably some of the horde playerbase would've be like this as well though. What i'd like to say to them: &quot;don't be such a bad loser and be a good sport&quot;. You can always roll a horde character to just 'get it' for your horde toons.<br />
<br />
It is idiotic to make that kind of campaign and then leave half of your players in the dust.</div></div><hr />

PS: I still think they're gonna get the Alliance bike in-game as a purchasable item.</div></div><hr />

That was the whole point, right from the start. I don't understand why people are whining about it now. They were very clear.<br />

Like other's have said I wouldn't have really used it (mostly cause I hate the sound that engineering mechanical mounts have in game) but the fact that they alienate a large portion of their player base is pretty stupid. The factions are already imbalanced to the point where top end guilds faction change to horde because they have an advantage. I just don't understand why it's not something for everyone and something only for a select population. That's so biased and fucked up. Shit. That's down right racist.<br />
<br />
It is widely agreed upon that the Alliance will have better racial abilities come WOD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I bet the Alliance players won't be crying for long though, this is a +1 to Horde meaning they'll have to make it equal.<br />
<br />
Dude. It's a bike. Not a flower pot. It's at least a +5. And the only way to make it even is to make the council of three hammers lead the alliance faction. :D</div></div><hr />

no that means sign up for another month of wow during this lull of content or you don't get the mount. That's all it means</div></div><hr />

You living in some country where if a team loses or people lose in an event, they just announce both winners?<br />
<br />
Bullshit, I'm a paying subscriber. I didn't sign up to the world cup, I voted in a competition. The competition is over, use the bike the majority voted for but theres no reason why one faction should be rewarded and the other told to go fuck themselves.</div></div><hr />
