Warrior's Gurth bonus is that the proc works with their mastery and inflated crit values. DK's Gurth bonus is that the proc scales with their mastery. Ret's Gurth &quot;bonus&quot; was a very small chance to possibly proc the tentacle more often, which is basically what Gurth does with the Arms warrior strike mastery (who already have insane damage output in DS). If Gurth is intended to be the only i416 2H weapon in the game, why does it support bonuses for DKs and warriors while at the same time denying ret any kind of bonus and, on top of that, guaranteeing a much lower proc rate than either DKs or warriors? The problem is the sword, not the spec. Fix the weapon to be even between DKs, warriors, and paladins.</div></div><hr />

There was a thread with several blue posts (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/215283-darkmoon-faire-known-issues/) and an MMO Champion post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1059466-Coming-in-Patch-4.3.2-Cross-Realm-Raids?p=14957997#post14957997) regarding this posted BEFORE the end of the faire. It had specific instructions to contact support for ticket reimbursement. Using the link provided I got my tickets in under an hour.<br />
<br />
They did what they could and they fixed it for next month. I'm sure the ticket reimbursement still stands. Submit a ticket.</div></div><hr />

Fixed that for you... <br />
These are not buffs, they are simply bugs and errors that were completely overlooked regarding hunters to begin with... But then again I was not overly surprised. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
A very small chance doesn't equal up to 20% of a rets damage on any given boss fight....The extra proc pallys were getting was almost on NO CD, thus making it a VERY large portion of their dps. Clearly not intended.</div></div><hr />

The Corrupted Parasite debuff is removed from a character who leaves the zone.<br />
<br />
Aww, why couldn't they not fix this for once? Would have liked to see people get killed en mass in cities.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Remember the debuff from Ignis's guards? Or that static shock thing from Halls of Lightning? All of the cool debuffs you can use to kill mass numbers of people in cities are eventually removed.</div></div><hr />

WTH are you talking about? I have it and it wass no more than 8-12% on average fight. My guildie arms warrior has it too and it was pretty much the same for us, RNG involved. His tentacles even beat mine sometimes. Now mine do half of his. &quot;The extra proc with almost no CD&quot; is nothing more than a chance from our attacks that proc Seal of truth to proc the tentacle too. So those attacks had 2 chances to proc it, the attack itself and it's SoT proc. That was balanced because we don't have that much melee attacks to proc it otherwise and our mastery does not affect it like arms warriors and UH death knights do. Now it's mostly arms warrior sword, when arms is the one that needs it the least.</div></div><hr />

Buffs? lol this and the other fixes are from bugs that should never of gotten off the PTR... fixing them 2 months after the patch goes live isn't really all that much to get happy about IMO... people have really low expectations if fixing a broken game 2 months after it comes out of testing is a good thing :(</div></div><hr />
