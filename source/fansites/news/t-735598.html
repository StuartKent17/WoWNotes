Blue posts<br />
Old Dungeons in Cataclysm<br />
The old dungeons are getting some love, including some new quests. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25968666885/if-you-re-locked-into-a-tree-at-level-10/))<br />
<br />
Leveling with a Healing spec<br />
We are going to make leveling easier for healing specs. You still shouldn't expect to do anywhere near the damage of a dps spec though (otherwise, why would you ever level as dps?).<br />
<br />
You can use your healing spec to use Dungeon Finder as you level. [...] But even if you don't use dungeons, you can level with a healer spec. I've done it a few times -- it's not super fast, but it's not horribly broken either, and it will be better in Cataclysm. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25968666885/if-you-re-locked-into-a-tree-at-level-10/))<br />
<br />
Pet scaling and Mastery bonus<br />
We can make the pet damage scale with mastery even if they aren't getting the same benefit you are (because in many cases that won't make sense). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626290470/31pt-talent-trees/))<br />
<br />
Not enough build choices in the new trees?<br />
WoW shipped with trees roughly the size the ones Cataclysm will be and I don't recall a lot of players at the time thinking that there weren't enough choices.<br />
<br />
In terms of pure numbers, the new trees offer fewer maximum number of combinations than the old ones. But many of the old combinations were not viable ones anyway. The new design is fewer meaningful choices rather than having lots of trivial (or even bad) choices. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626290470/31pt-talent-trees/))<br />
<br />
Exponential inflation of stats<br />
You're confusing relative to absolute effects in a couple of cases here. It is not harder to balance big numbers. Math works the same way on big numbers as it does on small numbers. It's harder to balance big numbers to small numbers, which might be a problem if we expected say level 85 characters to PvP against level 35 characters, but that's not how we design the game. It isn't important to us at all that level 75 characters can hold their own vs. level 80 characters. It's more fun to become more powerful as you level rather than see only slight improvements in your stats.<br />
<br />
Fresh level 85 content won't be trivialized by level 85 characters until a new patch comes out, at which point it's not fresh content any longer.<br />
<br />
The point I think has the most merit is your point A, but I think that one is a worthy sacrifice in order to be able to provide more content and a sense of progression to existing characters.<br />
<br />
There's a magic number that we've found over time to feel satisfying to players, and that's about the 13 item level jump between tiers of content. When the numbers are less than that, players see for example their health only go up by 10 or 100 points, which doesn't feel meaningful. They don't feel rewarded for their efforts and have less interest in doing the quests or dungeons or the new PvP season. If players gain a level or two and still have trouble with that raptor that gave them a hard time before, then they don't feel like the process of improving their character is worth it. Everything else is derived for the need to have that meaningful jump. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25969017999/exponential-inflation-is-bad-okay/))<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/271-Hunter) / 3.3.5 Talent Calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?hunter))<br />
Hunters in Cataclysm<br />
Chimera vs. Arcane &#8211; Chimera should have a higher DPCT/damage than Arcane as a tradeoff for having a cooldown. You should be casting Chimera before Arcane in any situation where it's not on cooldown. There numbers may not be tuned quite right yet.<br />
<br />
Serpent Sting &#8211; You&#8217;ll find it's not efficient to cast your damage-over-time on targets that die before Serpent Sting lasts the full duration. This is similar to other classes. Druids don&#8217;t use all of their bleeds on targets that die in 8 seconds; it's just not efficient. Chimera refreshing Serpent Sting is a bonus for fights that take longer, like boss fights or &#8220;epic&#8221; creatures. It isn&#8217;t factored into the &#8220;budget&#8221; of the ability, so don&#8217;t feel like you wasted a Chimera just because you couldn&#8217;t utilize the &#8220;refresh Serpent Sting&#8221; mechanic.<br />
<br />
Tranq Shot &#8211; We want this to have a focus cost. There may be opportunities where you want to use two Tranqs in a row, and it's your decision if you want to do that or not. I think most Hunters dislike it having a focus cost because they feel their raid leaders may mandate them to dispel something on an encounter, and because they have to spend focus it sucks because you lose DPS. That's legitimate, but also the same kind of decision that a lot of other classes have to make.<br />
<br />
Venoms &#8211; We hear you on some of their issues. We might try things like giving them some damage, reducing the focus cost, and / or have them last 5 minutes on PvE creatures. Again, shooting a Venom isn&#8217;t really ideal on targets that you kill quickly. You shouldn&#8217;t cast one on every trash mob, for example. That said, we don&#8217;t want them to become too &#8220;maintenance-y&#8221; on boss fights.<br />
<br />
Aspects &#8211; We would like Aspect of the Fox to be as good as it can be, which we feel is 30%. Any higher than that and we lose the Steady Shot focus-generating gameplay. It seems that some hunters are, not surprisingly, somewhat turned off from doing less damage while moving as they are on live, but this is intended. A ranged class that can do almost as much damage moving as it can standing still is not going to be fair, and often is what restricts us from doing cool things with the class.<br />
<br />
Trap Launcher &#8211; We'd like to take it off the GCD. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25969516735/initial-mm-hunter-thoughts-80-81/))<br />

Holy Paladins in LK<br />
I'm exaggerating slightly here, but our LK model for Holy paladins was that they could only do one thing well so they might as well be overpowered at it. We could essentially just balance incoming tank damage around outgoing paladin healing. The paladin niche was very small, so if they weren't good at single target and mostly tank healing, they'd be replaced. Yet because it was small, there wasn't much risk of overstacking them as healers.<br />
<br />
That model worked okay but it ultimately wasn't what we wanted, so we're going to change it in Cataclysm as much as we can without all of the healers playing identically. You should feel more comfortable having a paladin heal the raid and a druid heal the tank than most groups typically do now.

Sunder Armor<br />
Making Sunder do damage just felt too much like Devastate. [...] I've seen suggestions to have something you normally hit renew a Sunder. That might be the kind of thing we mess around with. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25969017063/bloodsurge-procs/))<br />
<br />
Enrage proc from damage done?<br />
Is there any chance this means the talent Enrage in the fury tree will proc off of damage done instead of damage taken? It seems unlikely warriors will be able to pick up Wrecking Crew with the new talent system, so I think the fury signature Enrage should work the way fury does; dealing damage. Not taking it. <br />
It's possible, but Fury also has Bloodrage, Berserker Rage and Death Wish. If Enrage included AE damage it would proc a lot more in PvE too. Like I said above, we want Fury to be angry a lot, but not 100% of the time so we may need to tweak things to get to that point. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25969017063/bloodsurge-procs/))<br />
<br />
Enrage-linked attack (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25969017063/bloodsurge-procs/))<br />
We are experimenting with an attack linked to enrage. Fury has a lot of ways to get angry now, and it has good synergy with their mastery and distinction from Arms. <br />
<br />
Please this, but don't consume the enrages. Requiring a rage to activate is fine, like GC said, fury warriors have lots of ways to get angry. But losing an 18% damage increasing enrage which we are balanced around having up 100% of the time is not worth an attack. Unless it is made so that it can only consume specific enrages (Blood Craze, Bloodthirst, etc.)<br />
Yeah, I actually think it's cooler if the enrage is not consumed. When you give up damage over time for sudden damage, it turns out to be a math problem, and you can see lots of examples where we've ended up reverting or letting you talent out of a &quot;consumes the charges&quot; mechanic. If Fury isn't enraged 100% of the time (but isn't enraged 5% of the time either), and they have an attack that can only be used when enraged, but can be used frequently at that time, then you might have a pretty interesting rotation. <br />
<br />
Arms is a gladiator, Fury is half naked (Sorry. Don't hate me warriors!)<br />
We view Arms as a soldier, like a career military infantryman. Think Gladiator. We view Fury as the wild berserker from up in the hills. Think Braveheart or Conan. It's easy to argue that bleeds or mobility fit one or the other depending on your point of view. Arms feels tactical (in the sense of having an answer for various situations) and Fury feels reckless. The Arms warrior has pet names for all his weapons, while the Fury warrior shows up for battle drunk and half clothed. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25969017063/bloodsurge-procs/))<br />

I really think they just need to give both trees the wrecking crew like arms has. Its the only way to make it work. Getting hit in pve as fury is suicide even on trash mobs. <br />

For what? Doing what she normally does? Fight Alliance and lead the undead?<br />
<br />
And let's be honest here.... Undead can't make babies. They make other undead. And to make an undead, you start with a dead person. And if you can't start with a dead person, you start with a living one. They have to propagate their kind somehow! :)<br />
<br />
AFAIK, the undead of Lordaeron have a very legitimate complaint against the living of Gilneas; if they didn't turtle away behind their wall the outcome of the 3rd war may have been different. Think of it as the Forsaken getting further revenge against the living that left them to rot (lol), since they've now dealt with the traitor prince that doomed them all in the first place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
they went into isolation and locked the gates at the end of the 2nd when they left the Alliance of Lordaron approx 5 years before the 3rd war even started.<br />
<br />
so pay close attention to this because ive seen a lot of people make the same basic lore mistake:<br />
<br />
The Greymane Wall was closed at the end of the second war as a result of Gilneas cutting all ties with the Alliance AND NOT at the start of the third when faced with the spread of the undead plague.<br />
<br />
<br />
on top of that its not the Forsakens idea to attack Gilneas.<br />
<br />
they are ordered to do it by Garrosh to secure a major port for the Horde on the Eastern Kingdoms.<br />
<br />
<br />
in short its a completely unjustified, unwarranted, surprise attack on a nation that wasn't an enemy beforehand and in all probablity has been completely unaware of the events outside its own borders for the past 13 years or so and that includeds the coming of the plague and the Scourge.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First off, THEY didn't deal with their traitor prince. They hindered the process with the Wrathgate and other aggressions before it. Pun intended, they were dead weight.<br />
<br />
Second, they don't have a means to procreate...and they shouldn't. There's no argument that Forsaken are unnatural...to force someone to come back and serve you is just the selfish whim of a long-useless bitch.<br />
<br />
Third, the outcome wouldn't have been different...at least not in a good way. Perhaps Lordaeron AND Gilneas would have been destroyed, but neither would have been saved. The plague wasn't a foe that could be stopped by force of will or number of troops.</div></div><hr />

WoW shipped with trees roughly the size the ones Cataclysm will be and I don't recall a lot of players at the time thinking that there weren't enough choices.<br />

In terms of pure numbers, the new trees offer fewer maximum number of combinations than the old ones. But many of the old combinations were not viable ones anyway. The new design is fewer meaningful choices rather than having lots of trivial (or even bad) choices.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />

I lold. Nice way of shutting ones eyes to the obvious problem of not being able to customize your character uniquely, but rather being forced (and even more so in Cata) into the same spec as everybody else, if you want to matter.</div></div><hr />

The only thing that limited the talent choices in vanilla was the fact that many talents and even whole trees were so bad they did not make any sense (hello balance &amp; feral!). Since this finally no longer the case after 5 years the Cataclysm talent trees will surely provide enough usable builds.</div></div><hr />

no, the thing is that it is stupid to force people to put 31 points into the same tree.<br />

Why?<br />
<br />
At the moment you're going to be putting 51 points in 1 tree so I'm not seeing much of a difference at top end. <br />
<br />
OK, so levelling could be interesting, but it isn't going to make THAT much difference to veterans (considering that it's all being redesigned, not just locked out in its current state, and newbies will find it a lot easier to get into if they're only trying to deal with 1 tree than picking out choices from 3.</div></div><hr />

This is going to happen regardless of what talents they make and they already know that. Somebody, somewhere, will work out the 'Perfect' spec and if you don't have that spec then &quot;you're a nub&quot;.

<br />
Well thats the problem, isn't it? WoW's talent trees are a useless piece of design - atleast when implemented along with the other functions of WoW, where people again are forced to do one or two things alone to achieve some sense of success. Now they are showing us they have given up on making it good, and instead chooses to make it even more simple and stupid. Why not use the expansion for a chance to completely ditch the fucking talent trees, or atleast burn em down and build em up again, completely different. Instead of making them deep, make them broad. Have many, many alternatives among talents, side by side, and let people choose one or two of them.<br />
Then create boss encounters etc that require some skill of every kind at some point to make it easier to beat. This isn't perfect, but it will create 10 or 20 different viable specs for each class, instead of 2-3.</div></div><hr />

Realize that:<br />
A. Even now, splitting your talents before 60 isn't the best way to go <br />
B. Dual spec still exists at 40<br />
C. You will still have points left over by level cap to put in a sub-tree</div></div><hr />

That's terrible design and completely hypocritical when you're complaining for &quot;more choice&quot;. When raid leaders will turn around and say &quot;Okay go respec in to Talent-That-Makes-This-Boss-Easier-or-Negates-a-Mechanic&quot; how does that give the player choice? And come on, '10 to 20 viable specs'? How naive are you if you think 100-200 specs are even remotely feasible to balance.<br />
<br />
Edit: Unless you're saying those skills should be shared amongst classes. In which case, enjoy many people complaining about &quot;lazy, homogenised design&quot;.<br />
<br />
The whole point of the new system is that you can choose talents that you find fun or exciting with, at worst, a negligible loss in efficiency. When choosing ABC talents instead of EFG results in 3% less DPS rather than 15%, people will stop being so anal about them.</div></div><hr />

Same here. I'm all for story and character development, but making the Horde (appear to) be more on the side of &quot;evil&quot;... C'mon, how does it make sense? :/<br />
<br />
Even so, I definitely will be taking my goblin through that place once Catacylsm goes live later this year.</div></div><hr />

humm........ the horde have always been the &quot;Bad&quot; guys from the get go. not saying they are evil, but deff on the darker side of life.<br />
think about it, the whole series started with the horde fighting the alliance. only to find out they were working &quot;for the legion&quot;. now you can argue it was due to the blood pact they had with that one demon, but they were still a tool for evil. continueing on horde never had the &quot;lets perserve nature and work friendly like&quot; with other races even once they were free'ed. there will always bee the good guys and the bad guys and depending on what side of the line you live on you see things differently. heh, though i would like to see a big baddie rise out of the horde side as most seem to come from the alliance side so far; see illiadan and arthus</div></div><hr />

Thats what fury get for mastery? It makes no sence to give them a damage bonus when they get hit. In raids and dungeons the idea is normally to not get hit.<br />

<br />
You have a point for druids - mixing up trees too much for a druid is and has always been a pretty bad idea, and has to be, or druids would be way too powerful. But what about pure dps classes? When you've got a maximum of 3 valid specs for each dps class, doesn't that seem a little boring to anyone other than me? Druids are probably the one class that needs to have a more strict list of talents to make them viable, because druids are the only class that has 4 different roles (tank, heals, phys. dps, caster dps). Homogenizing the pure dps classes tho is gonna be boring.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure that's more of the case for hunters and rogues rather than mages or warlocks since casters have specific school +damage talents. I don't think that having three interesting viable specs with varying gameplay options are boring at all. Blizzard wants three types of play for every class (four for druids). That's 31 different play styles that they need to keep balanced and interesting. Hybrid specs may be interesting, but that interest was born out of frustration with older mechanics.</div></div><hr />

You're pretty much in a crypt and just died becoming forsaken.. i fail to see the difference between this and raising humans as forsaken.<br />
<br />
only difference is there was no plague involved from the 2nd, but as you've seen in becoming a Death Knight where you kill the person you knew in a previous life as a DK, they try and make you remember your previous life and YOUR ARE NOT A MONSTER. (even at that time, you were pretty much a mindless slave of the lich king).<br />
<br />
So i fail to see the issue, if she doesn't find a way to make more forsaken there won't be a faction at all. And it'll be a weak chain in the horde especially with the focus being War. They wouldn't be able to hold territory or face a siege (especially with losses sustained from the rebellion and war in nothrend).<br />
<br />
All she's doing is bringing humans back from the dead and giving them a new chance as one of the forsaken. They have their own minds and souls, they essentially become a starting player. <br />
<br />
necromancy is mostly about binding souls to the necromancer, so the undead become mindless servants. she isn't doing necromancy as such, she's just raising the population of the forsaken (not the scourge, as she hates those with a passion).<br />
<br />

<br />
Here, I think you touch on the central issue of creation of new Forsaken: whether or not the corpses Sylvannas reanimates are a product of the Forsaken or their allies killing someone living.<br />
<br />
The way I see it, IF the Forsaken simply approached a living race with a deal: &quot;We'll give you the option that if you die naturally, by accident or by violence against someone besides us, we'll bring you back as one of us provided you consent to it.&quot; then replenishment of the Forsaken population would be fine and dandy for alot of folks.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, seeing as the Forsaken are assaulting Gilneas, I very much doubt anyone they're raising died from anything other than by Forsaken hands. It doesn't seem very possible that anyone consented to becoming new Forsaken here. <br />
<br />
I sympathize for the Forsaken, as I'd be pissed off too for being murdered and brought back as a cadaverous slave, only to be shunned by my countrymen upon regaining my free will. Though, if further developments continue to point to them intending to just kill everyone who's alive so that they can reanimate them as more Forsaken, I say &quot;Beware the Living&quot; indeed because I'll be ready to send them into the Afterlife they're apparantly too much of cowards to enter themselves.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Salz</div><div class="date">2010-07-13, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's funny how many people seem to think that the only race in the Horde are orcs and therefore all orc lore suddenly becomes Horde lore. They may have been the main driving force behind the formation of the Horde but it's best to remember that several races make up the collective there weren't any tauren guzzling down vats of demon blood were there? Perhaps it is good that Blizzard are pushing the other races to have greater roles in what direction the factions take. I mean when was the last time that any gnomes/dwaves/draenei shaped Alliance politics, probably as often as the tauren or trolls have.<br />
<br />
I don't necessarily like what Sylvanas is up to but at least she's not sitting around up a tree with her finger up her nose wondering when her boyfriend will wake up. The guys at Blizzard really need to spice up the Alliance goings on seriously, all the way through WoTLK we've had the various Horde short falls/angst/tendency to murder giving some sense action the whole back story and even though Varian came back they didn't really run with it apart from a few arguments with Garrosh or Thrall, bring the rest of the Alliance in from the cold.<br />
