Developer Interviews<br />
Several developer interviews will be coming this week, and Gamebreaker (http://www.gamebreaker.tv/video-game-shows/world-of-warcraft-video/legendary-world-of-warcraft-show/exclusive-interview-with-blizzards-ghostcrawler/) has released their interview with Ghostcrawler. A summary of the main points is below, but watching the full interview is worth it if you want to hear the full answers!<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
World<br />
<br />
Mists of Pandaria daily quests have shown that competing with other players for mob tagging and such is not fun. You should be excited when there are other players around, not grumpy! Blizzard is still actively looking for a solution to make it a nice thing to have other people around. <br />
It isn't likely that the concept of servers will ever disappear, but solutions for low population realms are still being looked for. <br />
There is a lot of variation in realm population as new patches come out, so merging and unmerging realms as the population goes up and down wouldn't make a lot of sense. <br />
<br />
<br />
Questing / Reputation<br />
<br />
Blizzard may have overdone the daily quests a little bit in pursuit of the goal of always having something for players to do when they log in. If they had to do it again, something like the Golden Lotus unlocking more and more areas would have been changed to just unlock a new area that replaces the old one, keeping the number of quests that you have to do every day the same. <br />
Golden Lotus and Klaxxi have enough daily quests to burn players out, while August Celestial and Shado-Pan have a more reasonable amount of quests.<br />
Lowering the rep requirements on some of the rewards was an attempt to make the amount of rep required before you could spend Valor Points more reasonable. If they had to do it again, it might have been nice to lower the requirements on some of the gear more so that there were some things to spend Valor Points on without grinding so many reputations. <br />
Historically, players would use alts as something to do after they were mostly finished with what they wanted to do on their main character. Mists of Pandaria's goal was to provide enough to do so that you never ran out of things to do, which is nice with one character, but less nice with many. Solutions to this problem are being looked at, but they want to avoid the extreme of giving every character everything or making everything account wide. <br />
One alternative being considered for reputation leveling is bonus reputation from your first scenario of the day.<br />
<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
<br />
The difference in difficulty between 10 and 25 man this time around was much smaller than before.<br />
When looking at raid DPS parses, you have to be aware of sampling bias. If all of the good players are playing one spec, then the DPS of the other two specs will be lower, as those players are messing around or don't know what they are doing. <br />
It isn't okay for a class to be really really bad on certain fights, but it is okay if some classes are somewhat better on some fights. It is more important to have fun encounters than it is to have an encounter where each spec is the best.<br />
Ideally we will never see a 5 or 6 boss raid tier again. <br />
The new loot system has worked out well, as players don't have any reason to be mad at each other over loot in LFR anymore. It is possible that we could see it being used in dungeons as well, but that is still under discussion. <br />
One thing being considered is offering another choice to players that get the same item from a boss repeatedly. This would be some consolation prize like loot, not another item from the boss.<br />
The use of PvP gear in PvE is okay, as grinding points to get an item rather than relying on a random drop is an idea that some players like. The item levels are lower than what the player would get in PvE, so the gear isn't overpowered. Players shouldn't have to go and do PvP to get gear to use in PvE or vice versa. <br />
Patch 5.2 is going to take a look at what talents are very popular or very unpopular and try and bring them back in line. Overall though, the new talent system is working out well. Ideally there should be at least two talent choices per tier that are good, if not three. <br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
<br />
PvP will never be perfectly balanced, but it can be balanced enough to be fun and fair. The balance in Mists of Pandaria still has some tweaking to do before it is at that point. <br />
Hybrids could see some PvP power going towards their off role damage or healing. It is okay for a DPS to throw out a few heals, but not okay if they are as good as a healer for their team. <br />
It is possible that base resilience could be increased to compensate for the PvP Power increase on Conquest weapons, but they need more than a few days of observation before a decision can be made.<br />
We may see some changes in the future to make things better for people who PvP on multiple characters, as far as earning Conquest Points goes. <br />
Many of the changes in Patch 5.1 were to address issues of PvP balance, and most didn't have a big impact on PvE.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 5.1 - Old Raid Encounter Changes<br />
We believe there was a lot of confusion when we originally announced this change and we're certainly at fault for said confusion. The original patch note was very vague to the point of being misleading. It was never our intent to weaken old raid boss encounters to allow anyone to have a chance to solo them, regardless of class, spec, or skill. <br />
<br />
What we did change were encounters that were mechanically impossible for one person to accomplish, solely for the purpose of ensuring players have easier access to the hunt for the new rare companion pets -- the drop rates of which are actually set to account for a group of three players, not one. <br />
<br />
Moving forward, though, we do not plan to adjust encounters for tougher raid bosses to be solo’able by all classes and specs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Battleground Queues and Addons<br />
if you break it down, what does a full oQueue premade bring to the table that is unfair?<br />
I’ll try to break it down as clearly as I can:<br />
<br />
Any addon that enables a full, organized Battleground group to queue against a randomly assembled group is creating a scenario where that coordinated group has a huge advantage. That is not in the spirit of the experience we want to provide in the normal Battleground queue. Playing with friends is fun and important, but it shouldn't come at the expense of the spirit of the game nor the fun of others.<br />
<br />
The normal Battleground queue is for players to jump in and play against other players in a similar situation. We realize that it's not a perfect system, and we're still looking at ways to improve normal Battleground queues further. Regardless, it's not meant for organized groups to &quot;pug stomp&quot; and get quick Honor. We have built in outlets for players that want to organize--if a competitive, social experience was really the goal, then there are clear ways to achieve that.<br />
<br />
The ultimate effect that this kind of queuing has had is to drive players away from PvP. Perhaps it's been a long time since you've been in a random group, but a lot of players will see that they're up against a premade and simply quit. At best, they suffer through it. To an extent premade groups count on this. Heck, one of the popular addons announces opposing players that appear to have rage quit.<br />
<br />
Addons aren’t really a viable solution for botting issues, but we do take those issues seriously and we'll continue our work on improvements to the Battleground system, including better ways to deal with botting and other exploitative gameplay.<br />
<br />
Now let us be honest, due to these addons and people like Rathamus and Tiny, regular Battleground PVP had picked up and was growing by leaps and bounds. That is what alerted you. More and more people were turning to the &quot;coordinated&quot; PVP and fewer and fewer &quot;random groups&quot; were being formed. The BG's were no longer sitting idle.<br />
False. That is neither what 'alerted' us, nor were Battlegrounds ever even close to sitting idle.<br />
<br />
What is true that there's been an increase in pre-made groups disrupting the PvP experience for other players, though. Pre-mades in the normal queue, however they are formed, are not something that we've ever been particularly fond of. It had become more of an issue of late, so we addressed it accordingly.<br />
<br />
I know for a fact, that more and more of our games were against other &quot;coordinated&quot; opposing players. Battles became longer, harder and a whole hell of a lot more fun! They were not the Farm fest you claim they were, they were true Player vs Player games. Not scripted, not forced on anyone, not the repetitive grind of the normal wow game.<br />
Perhaps this seemed to be your personal experience, but I assure you that this was far from generally the case. Regardless, what of the games that you played that weren't against other pre-mades? Just hapless casualties to your fun, I suppose?<br />
<br />
Based on your enthusiasm for &quot;true Player vs Player&quot; combat, I'm sure that you'll find War Games and Rated Battlegrounds quite compelling.<br />
<br />
You gave us everything we needed, including the idea, but then turned around and slapped our hands, pointed a finger, called us a name and said, this is NOT for you, it is for the REAL players.<br />
You've made the assumption that all those things were accomplished expressly so that you could queue into battlegrounds as an organized group against disorganized opponents? That assumption is mistaken. If you want organized PvP against organized opponents, as you claim, that experience is readily available.<br />
<br />
No one's wrist was slapped. There have been no suspensions over this issue. We're just making our stance on the subject clear, so that there's no room for misunderstanding.<br />
<br />
Fix the bot problem and you'll see the premade &quot;problem&quot; fix itself.<br />
Bots are a separate problem, with a separate solution. Please stop conflating the two, because, and I'll say this as respectfully as I can: this is complete nonsense.<br />
<br />
Put simply, this argument is a red herring. For as long as there's been Battleground PvP, there have been players looking for a way to destroy their enemies to quickly and easily get fast rewards with a minimal time investment. That's the bottom line here, or the variety of other options available would be more compelling.<br />
<br />
Bots aren't an issue in War Games or Rated Battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
We love a premade PvP, and we love challenges. You guys could've come out with a premade PvP random battleground where we can match against other 10m/15m/40m premades PvP and go all out. Provide less honor point/conquest point. It's like an RBG, but without the ratings involved. Doesn't this solves all the problem everyone's having?<br />
We're open to exploring the possibility of creating a pre-made queue for Battlegrounds, or improving the War Game system in some way. <br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Posts<br />
Battle.net Balance and Blizzard Store<br />
Using Battle.net Balance for more goods and services is certainly something we're working toward. We're kind of in an in-between stage where we have some services working together but not others, and unfortunately it's just not a simple thing to get as many systems and platforms (some dating back to the original release of WoW) as we have updated and integrated into a more cohesive experience. We'll get there though, and in the meantime I do apologize you weren't able to get the Cinder Kitten yet using Battle.net Balance. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/247086-how-to-really-help-red-cross/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7317191648?page=1#10))<br />
<br />
Purpose of X.1 Patches<br />
You forgot to mention those patches took months(I think ulduar was 5 month after Wrath launch) where as 5.1 was release in 2 months time. This was never meant to be a raid teir especially considering most people have not even downed most of the normal/heroic bosses.<br />
Yeah, the main difference is really timing. In our quest to provide content faster we've been shaking up the patch cycles and how we approach our content roll out through the life of an expansion. Not wanting to speak too soon, but it looks like the cadence of this expansion is a lot closer to what we've been promising for years. It makes sense to me that if most people are not progressed through the initial content that the first x.1 patch (if it's going to arrive as quickly as 5.1 did) doesn't include an additional tier. And if that then means there are regular content releases thereafter... I don't know, at least for as much time I have to play and as progressed as I am, it sounds pretty good to me.

<br />
Patch 5.2 Farm Changes<br />
How about a fishing pond, where we can chum the waters and get a school of fish we want/need? Dunno if that current pool is deep enough. Pfft.<br />
That was actually mentined in our last meeting with the development team. While I can't make you any promises, I can tell you they geeked out a bit thinking about that one.

<br />
WoW Graphics Engine<br />
If the game had received absolutely zero graphical updates since release, I could definitely get behind the idea of a complete revamp. But that's really not the case. There's been a steady stream of updates over the course of WoW's existence. A huge number of models and textures have been improved. Yes, character models are still on the to-do list, but we've acknowledged that many times and have said we're working on them. I'm as eager to be sharing news on that with you as you are to hear it, trust me.

<br />
Upcoming Transmog Restriction Changes<br />
Yup, definitely planning to lift this restriction down the line. As Zarhym said, we're currently hoping it'll make 5.2, but that's not 100% yet. We're working to allow you to transmogrify items that share animations, such as polearms and staves.

Easy solution remove tag for kills/quest loots but keep it for normal loot.<br />
You hit first a &quot;kill 10 of these mobs&quot; you are the only one eligible for the normal loot but everyone who hits it too gets the quest drop or the quest kill.</div></div><hr />

Making the game less rewarding is harmful and will only cause them to bleed subs. Telling players to go slowly makes content BORING because wow is a game driven by progression.

The system could be more intelligent. It's not cool getting an item you don't need sent to your bag and not get that one you really need from LFR.<br />
In the old LFR i could pass on stuff i didn't need and roll on stuff i need. As long as other players did the same, i had a higher chance than currently to get the items i need.<br />

how can you say the talents are boring, when you play for 2 weeks of new content and hardly put them to use? <br />
PVP will always be unbalanced it even says that in the posts. <br />

They can fix the obvious class issues but the constant tweaking of reputation and whatnot is just a waste of time if you would get a whole new 5 man dungeon for it in return. Fun new content &gt; tweaking grinds to fit everyones schedule/preferences.<br />

Yes I know, they have different teams for different parts of the game. Like they can't cut back on one team and get more people for another team or something.

Sure we're not whining at each other any more, but that's because players have no way of controlling the loot destribution, not because we agree with the system. Doing looking for raid should have a reasonable chance of giving you whatever item it is that you want. This chance seems -&gt;0 to me, which is simply wrong.

The LFR loot system is NOT good and it should NOT be added to dungeons or heroic dungeons.. or anything else. In fact it should be changed in LFR. Even the old system was better.<br />
Instead of having people ninjaloot, like you did before, you now have people disenchanting / vendoring items they never wanted in the first place. How is that better? How could that ever even be considered better? In what world is that better? It's a hell of a lot worse than ninjalooting. Atleast ninjalooting usually means that the item gets used by whoever ninjad it, because the player wanted it that badly.<br />
I know all of the above is just my opinion, but I am one of those guys going LFR to get the last items I need for my heroic progress, and I do it every week and I often get items, which I don't want, so I disenchant them, while I never get the items that I do want (the amount of items that I want is obviously less than the amount of items that I don't want).<br />

Ice block or deterence for pvp, lock portal and life grip if called for in pve or at worse pick a 3 min damage reducing CD like fortifying brew or icebound fortitude. If you're not using one of those for raiding you're doing it wrong.</div></div><hr />

The loot system is a LOT better then it was. The number of times I saw someone with the normal or heroic version of the item win the roll and then say that this was for his friend in the raid was completely stupid. The amount of times I was begged for an item because the other person had run it a million times and not won the roll, to the point I had to use the ignore function, was ridiculous. <br />
<br />
The system is now fair, balanced and can't be &quot;Gamed&quot;. <br />
<br />
While the multiple version of the same item is annoying, it can also be used to maximize your reforges depending on your spec. I have two of the same bracers, one for combat, the other for assassination, both with a different reforge. <br />
<br />
Your chances of getting an item are mathematically the same as before, the only difference is that it doesn't matter if my token is over or under represented in the group, my chances at loot don't change weekly. I no longer cringe when I see a dozen death knights in my LFR, because I am rolling against the system.</div></div><hr />

While i´m not that much of a fan of the new loot system having some friends roll on everything and then distributing it among themselves is what was wrong with the old system.<br />

I am amazed how quickly players forget how awful the old LFR loot system was. These posts using sad arguments about &quot;we could trade!&quot;<br />
Yeah, but apparently you've chosen to ignore all the times you had loot taken by someone who rolled just to be an asshole.<br />
<br />
And that's why arguments about the new system being objectively worse is simply wrong. The new system completely removed the factor of how many people that could roll on &quot;your&quot; items (oh, what's that? people have forgotten?)<br />
I remember dropping LFRs because there was &quot;too many&quot; who could roll on &quot;my&quot; tier token.<br />
I've dropped Madness runs because there was more hunters than me.<br />
<br />
The old system was retarded. And apparently your brain has done a good job of making up some bogus on how it was still better than the new system.<br />
You're not getting less loot on average. If you are, you're unlucky. I've had items I've needed desperately for weeks disenchanted in front of me, but that can't happen now. Only thing that decides now is not other players, but the random loot distributor. And that's the system that should be used in an unorganised cross-realm clusterfuck</div></div><hr />

This is nothing new. Since GC came on board they think that new expansions are great places to scratch great old ideas and implement new awful ones. Then the traditional backpeddling ensues after a few months when subs/interest drops a ton. <br />

Dailes are optional after you hit Revered. Up until then you NEED to do them to gain access to the Valor items. Of course technically you don't NEED anything in the game but if there was anything in the game that could be described as something you NEED it would be the gear that you use valor to buy. If you don't unlock revered you run out of things to buy with Valor very fast. If you have nothing to buy with Valor then you stop seeking it then what? Do you fish all day?</div></div><hr />

Overall though, the new talent system is working out well. Ideally there should be at least two talent choices per tier that are good, if not three. <br />
<br />
Here is a suggestion how about take the new and the old talent tree and combining them at one, have the point system from the old talent tree for the in between the levels and have the new one as per level required. Its not that I am enjoying the new talent tree its to has something different from the rest of the mmos out there. <br />
<br />
A few more suggestions that I would like to bring are the personal bank need more space I would like to see this increase, and well rep in my opinion sure be like the achievements account wide.

http://www.wowhead.com/talent#r|<br />
<br />
The only exciting talents are prep, shadowstep, and shuriken throw. Putting prep and shadowstep there is a massive nerf. Shuriken throw is the only one both new and exciting.<br />
<br />
You can make a side case for paralytic poison / prey on the weak, but even the mechanically powerful nerve strike is still hard to call exciting. And every tier here except the last one composes some old rogue power you have to give up.<br />

No class has ever been in as bad a position as 5.0 rogues. There's a difference between unbalanced and utterly fucking gutted. 5.1 rogues are a bit stronger, but time will tell whether they can pull out of &quot;worst repped class in wow history&quot;.<br />

Y is rolled on by 4 people who need it and 3 who just Need because they have had items &quot;stolen&quot; from them before.<br />
In the end, you don't get shit.<br />
___<br />
Every boss has a chance of &quot;dropping&quot; all items.<br />
Gold. Gold. Gold. Item!<br />
No loot drama.<br />
<br />
I am amazed how quickly players forget how awful the old LFR loot system was. These posts using sad arguments about &quot;we could trade!&quot;<br />
Yeah, but apparently you've chosen to ignore all the times you had loot taken by someone who rolled just to be an asshole.<br />
<br />
And that's why arguments about the new system being objectively worse is simply wrong. The new system completely removed the factor of how many people that could roll on &quot;your&quot; items (oh, what's that? people have forgotten?)<br />
I remember dropping LFRs because there was &quot;too many&quot; who could roll on &quot;my&quot; tier token.<br />
I've dropped Madness runs because there was more hunters than me.<br />
<br />
The old system was retarded. And apparently your brain has done a good job of making up some bogus on how it was still better than the new system.<br />
You're not getting less loot on average. If you are, you're unlucky. I've had items I've needed desperately for weeks disenchanted in front of me, but that can't happen now. Only thing that decides now is not other players, but the random loot distributor. And that's the system that should be used in an unorganised cross-realm clusterfuck<br />
<br />
The old system was bad - but it doesn't make the new system any good.<br />
<br />
WOW is not black and white like LFR system makes it look like. Many classes can use items that dont fit exactly the spec you are in the raid. For example - healers that dont need anything anymore from LFR are forced to go in LFR as DPS to increase their dps for Brawlers Guild. At the same time there are long queues because healers are needed in LFR....<br />
<br />
Thats just one example of how this new system actually makes the game WORSE than what it should be. We are now seeing the least amount of hybrid classes beeing played in ANY expansion. Most of it has to do with the fact that you are not rewarded as playing hybrid. <br />
<br />
http://www.warcraftrealms.com/census.php?serverid=-1<br />
<br />
I blame the current LFR system 100% for this - and it will get much worse the longer this goes on. Noone is asking for best gear in the game. Healers and tanks need dps items to do Brawlers guild and they also need items to make daily questing less painfull. If all players go DPS because of this - then the ques will become endless - so this LFR loot system does not work.<br />
<br />
All of this is very easy to fix. You give ppl the choise of what items they take from each boss. If they win - they get a list of items ... and they pick one. This also reduces the randomness of the system and doesn't make ppl ragequit after every week.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately the tabard system led to naught but faster burnouts and handling out too much reward for one repetitive task, i.e dungeons<br />
It's not coming back, but as mentioned they're looking for alternatives that doesn't funnel players into a single area.</div></div><hr />

They don't WANT to reduce the loot randomness. And letting people choose? What would this lead to other than picking the items you need (and of course in a set order from best to &quot;worst&quot; upgrade) and then stopping?<br />

<br />
Ye thats also true. I feel very strongly about this one spec drop system cause I think it could do soo much damage to the game in very short time. If we loose the hybrid classes out of the game or they all go dps now to do Brawlers guild (that is without a doubt based on DPS gear progression) then not only will LFR and LFD end up with lack of tank and healing roles.. but even normal raids will suffer. <br />
<br />
This system discourages ppl to try other specs. DPS players might do few LFR as healers or tanks if they had gear. They will NEVER do it in 463 gear or worse. And they will NEVER buy healing or tanking gear for Valor. <br />
<br />
This new loot system creates MORE unbalance than ever before in the game. This gets blown up even more with new systems like ilvl for valor and then more need for higher DPS gear with Brawlers guild and endless number of dailies. <br />
<br />
For me - BLizzard has failed horribly this expansion to create balanced - fair and rewarding system for all roles. If the game was balanced based on roles ppl would not need to stand in queues for half an hour. The CURRENT LFR system is increasing this unbalance. And it will only get worse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They will have to suffer from it forever then. Cause we will have fewer and fewer ppl playing healers - longer and longer queues until they are FORCED to do something.<br />
<br />
<br />
Im not saying ppl get a pick list of every item if they win. They get a list of items they can use (in any of their spec) from that boss. This leads to a healer that is now beeing forced to go DPS (to get dps gear) beeing able to queue up as healer - shorten the queue times for all and STILL be able to upgrade his offspec gear.</div></div><hr />

Because they are interesting. If you were, say, a resto druid, exactly two tiers of your class offers to trade something you had for something new (you can trade incarnation for a passive benefit or healing treants, you can trade nature's swiftness for two other healing tricks), while giving you mobility on a tier, a choice about how to be able to deal damage (a capability you never had), an entire tier of control, ranging from an instant cast non-dodgeable stun to more situational choices, and a tier relating to kiting and positioning.<br />
<br />
Paladins have a tier about movement (how do you want to be more mobile than a rogue?), a tier offering control (a ret could give up repentance here), two defensive tiers (mostly new with a couple redesigned / buffed abilities), a tier that controls how damage is dealt (in bursts? sustained?), and a healing / damage tier of entirely new stuff.<br />

I play on a low pop RP server and I see the same three servers on CRZ most of the time, so take Sentinels, Steamwheedle &amp; Scryers and just permanently link them. The tech solves the issue of having duplicate names and guild names as the home server is shown as a sort of 'surname'. Once you permanently link servers, you can now have them share an AH and enable cross server guilding and raiding for only those servers that are flagged as linked. In one step you take three low pop servers and triple their population without the hassle of true server merges. It seems like the best solution to me and the only tech they need to add would be cross realm guilds and AH. I am sure they could sort that out.</div></div><hr />

It's a case of 'you can't have your cake and eat it too'. The last thing I need is every druid and monk whispering me after every kill to ask if I won something I could give to them, because I already have better in the slot that boss drops. People complained about people ninja'ing their loot and people winning loot they didn't need to the point where Blizzard made everything individual, now they want it changed again cuz they realize the new system will actually gear you up more slowly than the old one, even with all the 'ninja' looters we had in Cata. I for one don't miss all the whining, complaining, griefing, begging, and trolling that went on with the old loot system and I don't want to see them do anything that may make it return, which includes making loot tradeable. The only change I'd like to see is an option to select the spec you want to gear for, without having to play it. Otherwise, leave LFR alone and let me vendor my purple trash.</div></div><hr />

It is but don't expect anybody here to understand that. In reality they are extremely selfish and wouldn't spread the loot around anyway. Like the guy above who couldn't be bothered to respond to players asking him to be a nice guy. Yet somehow they have the gal to call out the old system as being selfish because people loot traded with one and other. Whatever. This expac has just been frustration on top of frustration.

Tabards lead to burn out but dailies don't.How much double think will you people spew? Check this out. Tabards virtually removed any sense of grind from reputation factions in this game. Grind being the primary cause of burn out. Tabards were a vastly superior system and the fact that the developers don't recognize this basically means they will never understand that making the game less rewarding is not the answer to curing boredom. It just causes MORE BOREDOM.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're confusing it though. He states that the hubs with 4-5 dailies to do were a success and the ones like GL that has 12-15 quests were causing burn out. There has to be the grind or else it won't meet their goal of keeping people out doing them, but TOO MUCH and it causes the burn out he discribes. You need the grind to get the sense of accomplishment from the RPG, but they have to still make it fun. Tabard compelling gameplay decision is to remember to wear the right tabard that you aren't exalted. Obviously a step in the wrong direction for their design goal.<br />
<br />
Also I don't think he meant that the tabards cause burn out. They trivialize the rep grinds and leave you with nothing to do. Being burnt out means there's stuff to do but &quot;you've bitten off more than you can chew&quot;. If they were going to introduce the tabards back in as a means to gain rep with Shado-Pan while randomly queuing into Scholomance, so that you can gain rep doing something not at all related to that rep, then why is there reputation system in the game at that point?</div></div><hr />

Right. I fail to understand a internet fuckwad theory but the developers create CRZ which combines all the jackasses and assholes into one big soup with the decent folk. You guys are hilarious. Yea LFR had issues before. If this is the cure for it then it's worse than the disease.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The question was in response to mob tagging in CRZ not Pandaria, although I suppose mob tagging exists in lvl 90 dailies?<br />
<br />
It exists but respawns are fast enough that it has never been an issue for me. Other objectives which could have been potentially bad, like freeing the prisoner or killing the dragons/behemoth for GL, are already shared so Blizz had some good foresight on those.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes I think he got this totally wrong. Dungeons can be a burnout - but at LEAST its a grouping up experince that offers variety over the stagnant and totally dead daily quests. I still do my dungeon run for Valor every day rather than doing dailies. <br />
<br />
If BLizzard now thinks grouping up and socializing is now more chance of burnout than solo.... then I dont know why they call it MMO....<br />

<br />
The fact of the matter is that LFR is a huge and utter failure in the first place. If ppl are doing it every week for loot then why on earth does BLizzard not create 10 or 25 man normal content that ppl can do in guilds with that difficulty? Thats the thing. LFR is probably the worst experience in the entire game atm in any other than loot. Many ppl are not doing normal raids because that requires &quot;effort&quot; that in most cases is beeing online at certain time for 3-4 hours for 2-4 days per week. If GUILDS could do LFR and distribute the loot themselfs - then more ppl would probably fill up a 25 man raid and go for it on that LFR easy difficulty - have fun and work as a GUILD to help guildies out.<br />
<br />
LFR is a total and utter failure in all sence of the word. Blizzard should just give ppl 15 rolls per week per character to get 476 items.</div></div><hr />

I agree with you but peoples fail to understand what was the point of the new looting system; it was developed for the sake of removing loot drama from lfr and it worked, but intested many players think that personal loot = more loot sorry but it's not like this. As always if the rng god don't feel it you can do 50 runs and waste tonload of charms without your precious loot appearing in your bag, much like the raiders that do it on normal/heroic need to wait for the damn &quot;insert loot name here&quot; to drop.</div></div><hr />

If they fixed the drop rate and general items that are included (loot like you would expect from world drops - gold, misc gear etc) I wouldn't feel so ripped off for doing every LFR raid for 2 months and getting only 2 items. <br />
<br />
Why not include a wide-range of transmog only gear that can also drop, and perhaps some more profession patterns and companion pets?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm just going to quote what I said before this interview, which only stated the obvious, came out:<br />
<br />
<br />
You know it's truly Dailycraft when you grind daily upon daily to unlock the awe-inspiring reward of (ZOMFG!!111one) more dailies. <br />
<br />
That's probably why I had more fun with Tillers, you actually got more farm spaces = more gold and rep with the members. Every other zone just seems to reward more daily quests to grind.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure that is what people hated the most about Molten Front, not even the length, but the perception that you complete dailies just to get more dailies. A much more compelling reward would be better and more varieties of dailies as GC only now just figured out. And I believe that dailies rewarding charms and VP is good enough, there shouldn't be any gear tied to rep. Just mounts, pets, and vanity rewards. Maybe a nice VP bonus once you finish a quest chain.</div></div><hr />

Well the sad thing is that there was a lot of complaints about the Molten Front in regards to the way of starting out with only a few dailies and then being gated off from doing more. Then they go in and then place a gate on two fractions behind one that has a lot of gating going on.<br />
<br />
And I believe that dailies rewarding charms and VP is good enough, there shouldn't be any gear tied to rep. Just mounts, pets, and vanity rewards. <br />
Isnt odd that the ones that players seem to be enjoying in general are the ones that only offer cosmetic rewards and the painful ones are the ones that gear is gated behind. Seems more like a psychological test on the community.</div></div><hr />

Even more base resil would completely wreck the 70s bracket, healers and fc's in this bracket(myself included) are already at 80%+ resil and we have no wish for becoming immune again. <br />

Easy solution remove tag for kills/quest loots but keep it for normal loot.<br />
You hit first a &quot;kill 10 of these mobs&quot; you are the only one eligible for the normal loot but everyone who hits it too gets the quest drop or the quest kill.<br />
<br />
But that just makes it way too easy. As a feral druid, I could just run through the GL mogul area and faerie fire every mob that someone else is fighting.. I would be done my quest in 30 seconds with no effort at all. After awhile, everyone would be doing that.. using their lowest threat attack to tag their 10 mobs as quick as possible. heck, tag 20 in case someone does kill the first 10 fast enough.<br />
<br />
The real solution is to have rotating quest areas like AC, but have them random per player, not per server... for factions like AC, that would divide the population by 4 right away. Form a group before pickign up the quest, and everyone in the quest gets the same quest.<br />

<br />
Really? Do you remember grinding mobs endlessly in Sithilis for pages? Do you remember doing the same 4 quests every day for 2 months in BC for Ogrilla? The game is certainly not perfect, but anyone who thinks the game ´got worse´isn´t being honest.<br />
<br />
I am not kidding.. for probably 12 months, éndgame´ for non-raiders was killing human mobs in Sith for cen rep. You could also run 1 of about 3 dungeons for dungeon sets. That was it.<br />
<br />
The tabard system was a stupid way to do rep. Why even have the rep at all, just take the epics and put them as random drops on the heroic bosses in dungeons. Same thing. The reputations now are well done, the progress the story, they give you lore for going into dungeon and raids.<br />
<br />
Seriously, you might as well remove the graphics for mobs and dungeons.. just make it a white room you go into and roll for ´gear´ with plus 10 ilvls.</div></div><hr />

So now you want people to play loot Santa. The system is fine the way it is. As for people asking me to be to be a nice guy, if more than 5% actually asked nicely, then maybe that would work. You have no idea who I am, how I play the game and how I treat other people. It was people whining and complaining that they didn't get what they wanted that got the system changed. In my opinion the new system has drastically improved the experience in LFR., however people still aren't getting the shinies fast enough, so surprise, let's complain about it again. If I could trade loot I didn't need, I actually would, but at my discretion, not because people say &quot;GIMME&quot;, which is what would happen. The problem right now is the expectation that you should be able to run LFR 3 times and have all the loot you need. It's not designed that way, nor should it be. You still have two months minimum til the next patch, so why the hell do you need to have all your drops already? That's not the way raid gearing is meant to work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really. The ones where you need gear, for the entry tier, are ones you have to do to be competitive.<br />
<br />
The ones where you get cosmetic rewards are, as Blizzard tries to bleat on and on (like the goats, pun?) for all dailies, actually optional meaning you can just do them at your own pace.</div></div><hr />

And if you didn't know... 3 million is a number that is playing per week.... And this does not include Asia.<br />
<br />
No, that's not accurate. Warcraftrealm numbers aren't consistent with what the devs tell us (more rets than rogues, paladin the most popular class, rogue the least popular, druid extremely popular (read second most popular) ). That site is simply totally wrong.<br />
<br />
It should also go by common sense- go to any realm and /who. I don't know what's wrong with their addon, but if it's showing 4% druids and 5% paladins and 10% rogues, it is trivially incorrect. Look at who is in your BGs, your arenas, your LFRs, everything. You have picked one thing that you think argues something you believe, and it's bad data.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Your link is wrong cause its based on whole population of classes that are not even active.<br />
<br />
The 90s didn't all just give up bro. That argument makes no sense.<br />
<br />
<br />
Brawlers guild is pushing more and more dps classes into the picture in the last week. BLizzard needs to react now before it goes out of hand and queues will become over 1 hour long.<br />
<br />
I have no idea what you are talking about.<br />
<br />
warcraftrealms is garbage data. I linked you a real one, and GC has told you outright that paladins are the most popular class, and that at times like now, there are more rets than rogues.</div></div><hr />
