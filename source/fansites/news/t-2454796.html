<br />
Mythic Cache Next Week has Titan Residuum<br />
Immediately after the Tides of Vengeance update goes live with scheduled maintenance in each region, you’ll now be able to target specific kinds of Azerite armor by earning Titan Residuum (https://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1718-titan-residuum), which can be used to purchase Azerite armor from everyone’s favorite purveyor of exquisite furnishings: Thaumaturge Vashreen (https://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/149045-thaumaturge-vashreen), who can be found alongside his fellow ethereals in either Boralus or Dazar’alor.<br />
<br />
In the weekly cache, you’ll now receive an amount of Titan Residuum in addition to your weekly item. Completing higher-level Keystones will award greater amounts of Titan Residuum from your weekly cache. Scrapping or disenchanting new epic-quality Azerite gear obtained in Tides of Vengeance (from any source) also provides Titan Residuum, with more powerful items yielding more Residuum.<br />
<br />
After the update goes live, your weekly cache will contain Titan Residuum, and will not have a chance to contain a piece of Azerite Armor. We suggest you complete at least one Mythic Keystone dungeon before the update to make sure that you earn Titan Residuum when you open your cache after the update.<br />
<br />
There isn’t a cap on how much Titan Residuum you can hold, and we do not plan to reset Titan Residuum at the start of Season 2. When Season 2 begins, the vendor will offer higher item-level pieces (iLvl 400 or 415) at significantly higher costs than the Season 1 items. Also at that time, the weekly Mythic Keystone cache will begin rewarding proportionally more Residuum, and new iLvl 400+ Azerite armor will yield more Residuum when scrapped or disenchanted.<br />
See you in the dungeons!<br />
<br />
Yes. Completing Mythic Keystones higher than level 10 will yield more Residuum for each additional level, with diminishing returns.</div></div><hr />

I scrapped the WQ reward on the PTR (ilvl 370), it gave 12 of the currency.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are also vendors on the ptr - to gear people for testing purposes - that give you any 415 gear of your choice. And that 415-azerite is also scrappable and yields 365 titan residuum (TR). You can use that to buy azerite from the titan residuum vendor to find out the numbers for the different ilvl.<br />
355 yields 3 TR upon scrapping, 370 yields 12 TR, 385 yields 35 TR, didn't find a source for 400 (but someone sure can fit those datapoints a find a likely value) and as I already said 415 yields 365 TR.<br />
On the TR-vendor a random 355 azerite piece costs 15 TR, a random 370 50 TR and a random 385 165 TR, a specific 385 costs 675 TR.<br />
The values do not differ for slot - shoulder, helmet and breastpiece cost and yield all the same value.<br />
<br />
Addendum: There was a wq up for 325 azerite - that yielded no (!) TR upon scrapping.</div></div><hr />

Care to explain it a bit more? What is wrong with TR? Now you'll have something sure to work towards. Why is that a un-imaginative thing? What would you want instead, care to give an example? I'm curious cause I think TR is fine, might not be the best but I'm totally ok with it.</div></div><hr />

1. You cant farm it, beside from weekly cache, its all down to rng atleast for the pieces which gives you a decent amount (ilvl 385j. This is, atleast for me, by far the biggest issue. In terms of AP and good gear, you cant farm, only pray for TF in m+ or pvp. Im fine with not being able to farm bisgear first week but when they cannot even give the content people consider fun a decent AP reward, i dont know. You can farm cosmetics, toys and partially AP through the content people greatly dislike (WQs, Islands) but m+ and pvp gives close to nothing in that regard. Atleast legion had decent AP rewards for the stuff people actually enjoyed farming. Literally Zero players enjoy farming Islands. Sure a few enjoy a few, but farming? Noone. <br />
<br />
2. With PL, people will be even more likely to keep/not even loot a duplicate azerite piece, just so they dont have to trade and later can scrap it.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, this is what that I was focusing on for the majority of my time reading this update. Even if a guildie/friend, why give a piece away that is going to pay for an upgrade you will need later (and the only aspect of this system that is not complete RNG).<br />
<br />
Guess it's an option later...after your friend/guildie no longer needs that piece of gear. Rando-giveaway?</div></div><hr />

If you don’t find it interesting then how is that Blizzards fault? There are plenty of people who do find it interesting and enjoy it still.

what about the people that REALLY play the game for M+... Chances are they have this gear already.. <br />

this is not really an enhancement, it is more of a solution to get people to do more M+.. But, most players just do the M+ for the weekly chest, which as we all know tends to give the SAME gear all the time rofl.</div></div><hr />

You can farm it some though, by doing m0, right? That's epic quality azerite pieces. It's a very random cap per week though. We'll see how it turns out, you also get TR from weekly chest which scales with completed m+. I assume that means a +14 gives more TR than a +10.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, the fact that the cache won’t even drop Azerite gear anymore is fucking stupid. Haven’t gotten a piece in weeks and I would’ve been due soonish with Bad Luck Protection. So, I’m now stuck targetting them without a chance of getting even a chance of acquiring one elsewhere?<br />
<br />
This system doesn’t make it easier; It’s gonna take longer now. I get residuum from my weekly cache or from scrapping epics. Well, where the fuck do you get those epics if Caches don’t drop em?? Hope everyone raids Mythic, cuz Blizzard just fucked you if you don’t. Especially if you consider that only 385s give you a remotely decent yield of the currency.<br />
<br />
Oh, and the classes that are getting buffed in the form of new Azerite traits, well fuck you especially.<br />
<br />
Finally, the classes that are so poorly balanced that you don’t get taken to the highest keys which would award more Residuum, well triple fuck you.<br />
<br />
This system is a classic step forward and two steps back.</div></div><hr />

There is no such thing as bad luck protection. It's just a fairy tale blizz spun to keep people from quitting and keep trying. Obviously you're going to get a gear to drop sooner or later and with rng being rng there is no proof it even exists</div></div><hr />

Looks at months and months of shitty RNG based boring grinding in a broken game system<br />
Looks at Credit Card crying in the corner<br />

Now you'll have something sure to work towards. Why is that a un-imaginative thing? What would you want instead, care to give an example? I'm curious cause I think TR is fine, might not be the best but I'm totally ok with it.<br />
<br />
I have no problem with there being an item to help 'buy' what you want.<br />
<br />
I was referring to the un-imaginative shit name they gave it.<br />

Time to log out, go outside for a walk and then get a good night's sleep.<br />
<br />
I would but....I don't play, so I am unable to log out. I am lazy so I drive instead of walk. I would get a good nights sleep, but because I actually work for a living, I stress over shit that needs to get done.</div></div><hr />

There are plenty of people who do find it interesting and enjoy it still. The game has plenty of content beyond mythics and raiding, but people choose not to do it and then blame blizzard for their boredom and their lack of interest.<br />

Just wondering which game you've been playing so I can activate a subscription to it.</div></div><hr />
