Welcome to our World of Warcraft: Legion class preview series. In this entry, we’re exploring the Warlock—to find out what’s in store for a different class, check out the overview. <br />
<br />
We continue our early look at class and specialization design with the Warlock. In these blogs, we’ll be exploring class identity, discussing Legion’s new designs, and presenting core combat abilities for each specialization—laying out the foundation upon which talents and Artifacts will build further. With that in mind, let’s delve into what it means to be a Warlock in World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
Warlocks are the most volatile and insatiable of spellcasters. Though they often pledge themselves to the service of noble causes and are not innately evil, their desire to understand darker magics and exercise unwavering command over demonic forces breeds mistrust among even their closest allies.<br />
Warlocks peer into the Void without hesitation, leveraging the chaos they glimpse within to devastating ends in battle—their greatest abilities are fueled by the souls they’ve harvested from their victims. They exploit powerful Shadow magic to manipulate and degrade the minds and bodies of their enemies. They employ Fire magic, dropping hellish rain from the sky, to immolate the opposition. They summon and command indomitable demons from the Twisting Nether to do their bidding, or even to be sacrificed as the Warlock sees fit, empowering and protecting the dark caster from harm.<br />
<br />
The foundation of the Warlock class has been long and well established in Warcraft lore. However, while Affliction and Destruction Warlocks have maintained consistent, distinguished fantasies, the core identity of the Demonology Warlock has strayed too far from its roots in recent years. A primary goal for Warlocks in Legion is to accentuate the existing motifs for Affliction and Destruction, while returning Demonology back to its roots of summoning, utilizing, and empowering demons.<br />
<br />
Warlock resources have also become too cumbersome, causing confusion that outweighed their depth. To this end, we’re going to once again standardize Warlocks on their most class-defining resources: Mana and Soul Shards. Finally, demons have always served various utility purposes, but most of them are very niche, while the same one or two demons see the vast majority of limelight. We want to re-incentivize demon variety, strengthening the various utilities that each demon supplies, and causing some demons to be favored based on the Warlock’s spec.<br />
<br />
Affliction[/b][/size][/center]<br />
Affliction warlocks are masters of shadow-touched powers, but unlike shadow priests—deadliest when pushed to the brink of insanity—these warlocks delight in using fel forces to cause intense pain and suffering in others. They revel in corrupting minds and agonizing souls, leaving enemies in a state of torment that would see them undone in due time. Even the most battle-hardened warriors can be deceived, landing blow after blow against the warlock, only to succumb to their suffering as their very vitality is siphoned away by the dark spellcaster. <br />
<br />
&quot;These warlocks delight in using fel forces to cause intense pain and suffering in others&quot;<br />
<br />
Gameplay<br />
Affliction Warlocks’ gameplay has always aligned well with their character, but in terms of abilities, we want to avoid the feeling that DoTs are amplifiers for your channeled single-target damage. Applying spells that do damage over time is very core to Affliction, so we want to reinforce these spells as the primary source of damage, with other “filler” spells feeling more secondary. We’re adjusting the Affliction rotation so that DoTs are stronger, and your focus is more on figuring out how best to juggle those DoTs to maximize damage output.<br />
<br />
Mechanically, we’re altering how Soul Shards are generated and spent, in part to better deliver on the more DoT-driven damage. Soul Shards are now generated by each Agony you have up on your targets, instead of only by your most recent Corruption cast, to favor placing DoTs on several targets rapidly (multi-dotting). You’ll then spend Soul Shards on an extremely strong DoT in Unstable Affliction, reinforcing the focus on DoTs.<br />
<br />
Finally, in keeping with the Affliction theme, Drain Life serves as the main filler spell, instead of Malefic Grasp or Drain Soul. This better matches the Affliction identity because its damage stays secondary to the DoTs, which should be the primary focus of damage, instead of dwarfing them. It also adds significant self-healing, further playing to the Affliction motif.<br />
<br />
To give you an idea of the Affliction Warlock in action, here’s a basic look at their core combat abilities:<br />
<br />
Corruption<br />
<br />
3% Mana, 40 yd range, Instant<br />
Corrupts the target, causing moderate Shadow damage over 14 sec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Agony<br />
<br />
3% Mana, 40 yd range, Instant<br />
Inflicts increasing agony on the target, causing up to a huge amount of Shadow damage over 18 sec. Damage starts low and increases over the duration. Refreshing Agony maintains its current damage level.<br />
When Agony deals damage, you have a chance to regain a Soul Shard.<br />
<br />
<br />
Unstable Affliction<br />
<br />
1 Soul Shard, 40 yd range, 1.5 sec cast<br />
An especially insidious affliction that deals strong Shadow damage over 8 sec.<br />
If the target dies, the Soul Shard will be refunded.<br />
If Unstable Affliction is dispelled, the dispeller suffers strong Shadow damage and is silenced for 4 sec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Drain Life<br />
<br />
3% Mana, plus 4,800 per sec, 40 yd range, Channeled<br />
Drains life from the target, causing moderate shadow damage and restoring 18% of the caster’s health over 6 sec.<br />
Drain Life’s damage is increased by 50% for each of your Corruption, Agony, and Unstable Affliction effects on the target.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mastery: Potent Afflictions<br />
<br />
Increases the damage of Agony, Corruption, and Unstable Affliction by 62.5% (with Mastery from typical gear).<br />
<br />
<br />
Additionally, to provide a glimpse at how some talents may build upon this, here’s one example of an Affliction-specific talent:<br />
<br />
Contagion<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
After you cast Unstable Affliction, you can cast a second one for free, within 3 seconds.<br />
<br />
<br />
Demonology[/b][/size][/center]<br />
By their very nature, demons are leeches on the living universe—but the demonologist has mastered harnessing the power of these malefic beings on the field of battle. Warlocks harvest the souls of their defeated enemies; those specialized in the ways of demonology use this life essence to tap into the Void, pulling all manner of abomination from the chaos of the Twisting Nether. While such a practice is often considered by outsiders to be wicked and reckless, the demonologist maintains absolute control over the summoned creatures. These malignant entities are fully beholden to—and empowered by—the will of the warlock, until banished to the realm from whence they came. <br />
<br />
&quot;The demonologist has mastered harnessing the power of malefic beings on the field of battle&quot;<br />
<br />
Gameplay<br />
While all Warlocks maintain the power to summon demons, Demonology is distinguished by the ability to call forth waves of demons to overwhelm the opposition, and also to further empower the demons they summon. Over the years we strayed too far from this design, to the extent that Demonology gameplay was defined more by the Warlock becoming a demon. Legion provides a fitting opportunity for us to realign the spec around its core function of mastering control of demons, not transforming into them.<br />
<br />
We also recognize that Demonology had a large array of intertwined mechanics that weren’t intuitive, and they’ve undergone a greater degree of redesign as a result. For those who played Demonology during Warlords of Draenor, the gameplay will feel quite different in Legion. Beta test feedback will be essential in helping us to ensure that the new spec feels strong and enjoyable and that we’ve accomplished our goal of returning Demonology to its foundations.<br />
<br />
To give you an idea of the Demonology Warlock in action, here’s a basic look at their core combat abilities:<br />
<br />
Shadow Bolt<br />
<br />
6% Mana, 40 yd range, 2.5 sec cast<br />
Sends a shadowy bolt at the enemy, causing minor Shadow damage. Generates 1 Soul Shard.<br />
<br />
<br />
Call Dreadstalkers<br />
<br />
2 Soul Shards, 40 yd range, 2 sec cast, 15 sec cooldown<br />
Summon 2 ferocious Dreadstalkers to attack the target for 12 sec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hand of Gul’dan<br />
<br />
1 to 5 Soul Shards, 40 yd range, 1.5 sec cast<br />
Calls down a demonic meteor full of Wild Imps which burst forth to attack the target for 12 sec.<br />
Deals up to a strong amount of Shadow damage to all enemies within 8 yds and summons up to 5 Wild Imps, based on Soul Shards consumed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Demonic Empowerment<br />
<br />
6% Mana, 1.5 sec cast, 12 sec recharge, 3 charges<br />
Empowers up to 3 of your active demons with dark energies, increasing their Haste and health by 50% for 12 sec.<br />
Prefers stronger demons first.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mastery: Master Demonologist<br />
<br />
Demonic Empowerment also increases the damage of your demons by 50% (with Mastery from typical gear).<br />
<br />
<br />
Doom<br />
<br />
2% Mana, 40 yd range, Instant<br />
Inflicts impending doom upon the target, causing absolutely massive Shadow damage after 20 seconds<br />
Generates a Soul Shard when it deals damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Demonwrath<br />
<br />
2.5% Mana per sec, Channeled<br />
Your demons crackle with demonic energy. Every 1 sec, all enemies within 10 yds of any of your demons take minor Shadow damage.<br />
Each time Demonwrath deals damage, it has a 15% chance to generate a Soul Shard.<br />
May be channeled while moving.<br />
<br />
<br />
Additionally, to provide a glimpse at how some talents may build upon this, here’s one example of a Demonology-specific talent:<br />
<br />
Implosion<br />
<br />
6% Mana, Instant<br />
Causes all of your Wild Imps to be violently yanked toward the target, and then explode, dealing moderate Shadow damage to all enemies near them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Destruction[/b][/size][/center]<br />
Warlocks who command the power of destruction favor incantations of pure chaos and aggression in battle. In this regard, they’d find a stronger kinship with fire mages than warlocks of other disciplines—if not for their propensity to make use of magic deemed detestable by all mage orders. The destruction warlock is well-versed in discharging a dizzying array of shadow, fel, fire, and chaos magics upon opponents that rattle souls and conflagrate bodies. They require little motivation for the havoc they wreak, happy to revel in the destruction they cause—thrilled at any opportunity to watch the world erupt in discord around them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Warlocks who command the power of destruction favor incantations of pure chaos and aggression&quot;<br />
<br />
Gameplay<br />
Destruction mechanics are in a solid place overall and are already a good match thematically, so we’re taking the opportunity in Legion to provide additional polish on existing gameplay. While resource mechanic functionality isn’t being drastically overhauled, we’ve changed Burning Embers back to Soul Shards. Not only does this return consistency across all Warlock specs, it also reestablishes the Soul Shard as the iconic source of Warlock power.<br />
<br />
To give you an idea of the Destruction Warlock in action, here’s a basic look at their core combat abilities:<br />
<br />
Incinerate<br />
<br />
6% Mana, 40 yd range, 2 sec cast<br />
Draws fire toward the enemy, dealing moderate Fire damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Immolate<br />
<br />
6% Mana, 40 yd range, 1.5 sec cast<br />
Burns the enemy with fire, causing minor Fire damage and an additional strong Fire damage over 15 sec.<br />
Immolate critical strikes have a 30% chance to generate a Soul Shard.<br />
<br />
<br />
Conflagrate<br />
<br />
2% Mana, 40 yd range, Instant, 8 sec recharge, 2 charges<br />
Triggers an explosion of fire on the target, dealing moderate Fire damage and generating a Soul Shard.<br />
Also causes Backdraft, reducing the cast times of Incinerate and Chaos Bolt by 30% for 5 sec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Chaos Bolt<br />
<br />
2 Soul Shards, 40 yd range, 2.5 sec cast<br />
Unleashes a devastating blast of chaos, causing huge Shadow damage. Chaos Bolt always critically strikes and your critical strike chance increases its damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Havoc<br />
<br />
8% Mana, 40 yd range, Instant, 20 sec cooldown<br />
Mark a target with Havoc for 8 sec, causing your single target spells to also strike them. Limit 1.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mastery: Chaotic Energies<br />
<br />
Your Destruction spells deal up to 40% (with Mastery from typical gear) additional damage, randomly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Additionally, to provide a glimpse at how some talents may build upon this, here’s one example of a Destruction-specific talent:<br />
<br />
Channel Demonfire<br />
<br />
4.8% Mana, Channeled, 12 se cooldown<br />
Launches 15 bolts of felfire at Immolated enemies within 40 yds, over 3 sec. Each bolt deals moderate Fire damage.<br />
<br />

Affliction has always been my favorite spec and it seems that they are replacing the soul shard aspect of Haunt with UA. I was set to go DH for this expansion until I was reading some of the early changes and decided it was time to go back to my purple roots. I cannot wait to see demonology on the PTR, this could really make me have fun in this game again.</div></div><hr />

Kind of wish they would have kept Corruption to have it work as a damage amplification for Hand of Guldan, Demon Wrath, and Imp'sfiend Grasp (talent shown because that is what it is, and Implosion sounds underwhelming) for a slightly higher aoe skill cap, but it seems interesting enough. <br />
<br />
Also does Incenerate take the place of a complete filler, with no soul shard generation mechanic now? <br />
<br />
Last thing:<br />
<br />
Not only does this return consistency across all Warlock specs, it also reestablishes the Soul Shard as the iconic source of Warlock power.<br />
WTB the ability to capture souls outside of dungeon/raid environment and be able to use them as a Intellect Potion alternative.</div></div><hr />

Then, it got nerfed in WOD to be a filler spell in the rotation. That sucked, but I lived with it. Now they are just removing it completely? That's the last straw! I was hoping for the exact opposite - buffing Drain Soul so that it became AOE (like chain lightning) through a talent or something.

Demo sounds pretty neat though and Implosion sounds hilarious. Please lower the cast time on Shadowbolt a bit though, it's odd that a low damage filler spell that is really quite necessary to do any damage takes so absurdly long to get off. I guess the destro changes are fine.<br />
<br />
Edit: also, what about Soulburn? Do all specs get it, or is it being removed entirely? Do shards fade outside of combat, or can we start a fight with full shards every time?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, to be fair, they didn't say they were removing it, just that it wouldn't be our primary filler. It may be that it's something we use for quick soul shard regeneration at a slight dps loss, or maybe they're going back to it being our &quot;execute&quot; thing, where we want to switch to it when the target is under 25%.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's no channeling AOE for Affliction, unless I am missing something. MOP had Harvest Life in the beginning, but they removed it, unfortunately. It was probably my favorite spell in the game (next to chain lightning).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know about them being too cumbersome, but as someone who remembers (with equal parts fondness and ruefulness...) spending the hour before raid sucking the souls out of random creatures to fill my bags with shards, it did feel like some essential part of the class was lost the day they made it an affliction only thing.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qaenos</div><div class="date">2015-11-10, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, to be fair, they didn't say they were removing it, just that it wouldn't be our primary filler.

<br />
Technically, they didn't say they were removing it, but they said they were replacing it with Drain Life in the rotation. If it was meant to be the execute (like it used to be), wouldn't it have been mentioned as one of the &quot;core&quot; spells?<br />
<br />
I can only hope that Drain Soul is still in the game, perhaps as a talent. Of course if they extended it to be AOE (particularly with a chain lightning like effect), I would be ecstatic, but for now I'm just hoping that they didn't get rid of it.</div></div><hr />

Blizzars tried numerous fillers and none felt really affliction-like, Drain Life always has been the most suitable filler.<br />
<br />
For once BLZ make perfect sense. I dislike haunt as well. Perhaps it is gone but then I wonder what burst we get when the target is above execute range.<br />
Anyhow I would love to once again be able to play affliction in bgs like it is meant to be, multidotting.</div></div><hr />

On topic, I've played demo on my lock since I created her (then him) back in Cataclysm. I like this change very much and look forward to blowing my imps up all over my enemies. Also, I may finally try affliction now, considering it looks like fun (it didn't before).</div></div><hr />

Drain Life is gonna be insanely OP in PvP. 18% health over 6 seconds? Come on!<br />

Yeah, I'm sure an Aff lock will be able to sit there and freely channel all that health back. It would still take over 30 seconds of just channeling to restore 100% hp.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coils</div><div class="date">2015-11-10, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Affliction: doesn't seem like much has changed, other than replacing Haunt with UA, which simplifies the rotation. Multi-doting being encouraged makes sense. Drain Life now the new MG/DS (I remember devs specifically saying they didn't want DL as a filler two or so years ago...), which really is a flavor only change. I don't see much reason to be excited about Affliction yet.<br />
<br />
Demo: Sounds like what they were hinting at. Rotational abilities that summon demons are neat, though the novelty may wear thin and there may be pet issues. Implosion looks really fun and adds some depth. Demon-empowering abilities sound like it will be a little unsatisfying to press though. <br />
<br />
Destro: shards fulfill the destroy fantasy less than embers, but just optics. Incinerate no longer generates resources along with CB costing two shards will slow the spec down a lot. <br />
<br />
Ultimately, the driving message these previews leave me with is that the core specs are very basic and simple to play, and that most of the additional complexity and depth will be coming from the talents and artifacts. Eagerly shifting my attention towards waiting for beta.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We don't know it isn't coming back, given how they describe only one &quot;core&quot; talent for each spec.<br />
Given the use of Drain Life as the Affliction filler then it makes sense at least one talent will be altering it.<br />
I think that gives a good opportunity for it to return, especially as Affliction needs better AoE than Seed of Corruption in its current state.<br />
<br />
Also interesting is that shards are increased in quantity to 5, as shown by the Hand of Gul'dan usage, as a spender with greater effect the more you spend.<br />
I said previously that warlocks were a generator/consumer of the simplest form with fixed discrete costs for the spending.<br />
This is a welcome extension to the dynamic that combo points offer in terms of spending.<br />

Affliction was too reliant on haunt, taking too much away from the DoTs themselves.<br />
They hit like a wet fish without it.<br />
This is an early preview of what they deem to be the core abilities and mechanics of each spec.<br />
This is by no means meant to be the full set of tools each spec will have, and we only see one talent for each spec.<br />
There will be more.</div></div><hr />

I do really like the new Demo changes! I always loved Affli, been one since I started playing lock 8 years ago .. but those Demo changes are intriguing might make it my off-spec ..

Also I must say being a lover of the class (Warlock) all the specs still seems the same for example Affl can summon out pets so can Demo and Destro, I don't think I have to mention they are all the same pets. And all the specs have at least 1 dot to keep up that's the same across the board (Corruption/Immolate) at least fire mages have a dot baked into there spells.

The abilities listed are the base core mechanics. Through talents, you'll be able to choose from a variety of active abilities to add into your normal rotation. For Fury, a dev had said they have a choice of up to FIVE more active short cool down abilities to make their normal rotation personalized and meaningful. <br />

As a Warlock playing since EU release Feb. 2005, these changes look very good. Demo, back to the &quot;roots&quot; and removing this transform shit which was never a real Warlock thing. Pushing affliction to once again, DOT as a main damage source like it used to be. If haunt is gone, i wouldnt complain, if dots do much more damage then its ok. Less to cast in arena/bg. and UA beeing a very srong dot for 8 seconds, sounds very promising. As you always had to cast it anyway, that it seems to be the strongest dot as affliction, and not agony. Thats how it always should have been imho.<br />
<br />
Only thign i can complain about is destrution getting back soulshards. Yes, its a core thing of Warlocks, but i think Embers are fitting really well to the felfire caster type of Warlock.</div></div><hr />

Destro, my favorite spec for sure... Eh...<br />

It feels kind of boring, really. To be fair, I don't feel they needed to change anything, except giving us a spell that can be cast while moving, as movement is a really big issue, particularly in PvP.<br />

<br />
Not exactly. The Shadow Priest preview didn't mention a thing about Shadow Word: Death, except their Mastery increased the damage done from it -- the reason we know it's staying around. As that's an execute ability, it would follow that they wouldn't mention an execute ability here either.</div></div><hr />

Demonology though sounds spectacular and far more what I've thought the spec should be about - throwing demons at enemies to torment and hurt and kill them. I'll be dusting off my Warlock alt for sure to try this out.</div></div><hr />

Destro used to be the random spec back in vanilla, with various talents and effects to make spells randomly deal up to five times their normal damage. So it's retro. It was also quite fun when you got really big numbers.</div></div><hr />

They could have just delineated between the demo appearance and the DH look for the spell, and made the Demo meta more about empowering spells/demons. <br />
<br />
Nonetheless, what I see here are good ideas. I hope the spec will retain Hellfire for reliable AOE, although HoG, followed by Demonwrath, could be sick.<br />
<br />
Destro... do they honestly think it's in a good place? It's more simplistic than ever. I liked the ISF variant in Cata, even though it was clunky. Also not happy about the loss of Embers, as they fit destro very well thematically. Why no mention of Conflagrate's synergistic slow?<br />
<br />
Also, use a goddamn BE instead of a gnome. They have more to do with fel than gnomes.<br />
<br />
This quote:<br />
<br />
<br />
Warlocks are the most volatile and insatiable of spellcasters. Though they often pledge themselves to the service of noble causes and are not innately evil, their desire to understand darker magics and exercise unwavering command over demonic forces breeds mistrust among even their closest allies.<br />
<br />
is interesting, as it dispels the misconception that warlocks are inherently 'evil'.</div></div><hr />

The satisfying build to 4 massive charges of demon bolt, coupled with weaving doom and corruption, poping in and out of meta to maximize dps in add or ST situations; demo 6.1 is the most fun I've ever had with a warlock. Too bad that's been nerfed into obsolescence, and will be gone during the next expac. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure how much enjoyment I'll get out of consistently summoning demons and having them have all the fun/deal the damage, but maybe I'm being pessimistic.</div></div><hr />

As much as I adore fire classes, I shelved my poor lock because zzzzzz sooo boring, and the lack of any mobility was annoying to me, particularly in HFC (no KJC doesn't count, as taking it over others was a major DPS loss). But at least it kinda made sense with embers, and our ember generation was predictable. These changes seem like you've just taken an already boring spec, removed an identity thing that made total sense (embers), and made it more RNG based. So what, the RNG is supposed to make it less boring due to unpredictability? Yeah, no thanks. I was really hoping for Destro to be spiced up, especially after seeing the changes to other classes so far. Disappointed on this one, but I'm going to hold out hope that talent options and beta will resolve it.<br />

That's unbelievable! Drain Soul is my favorite single target spell in the entire game and the whole reason I played Warlock! The channeling animation was beautiful and quite unique. Drain Sould was THE defining spell for an Affliction Warlock - it used to be our execute and the method by which we gained soul shards - everything else was just setting it up. Then, it got nerfed in WOD to be a filler spell in the rotation. That sucked, but I lived with it. Now they are just removing it completely? That's the last straw! I was hoping for the exact opposite - buffing Drain Soul so that it became AOE (like chain lightning) through a talent or something. They used to have Drain Life AOE (called Harvest Life) but they removed it because it was doing too much self-healing. If Drain Soul is gone, I'm gone.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pitakos</div><div class="date">2015-11-10, 08:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, you get the awful mechanic of random generation of soul shards that I hated so much in Affliction, and apply it to the other 2 specs with the 2 better resources.<br />
<br />
<br />
Demo has to cast a 2 sec skill to 2 summon 2 demons that do the dmg for him , then summon with the remaining 3 shards 3 imps with Hand of Gul'dan, use every 12 seconds Demonic Empowerment, Doom and a filler 2.5 sec cast Shadow bolt to get as much shards as you can before repeating the same process ? PvE wise seems way to immobile, and not viable at all in PvP.<br />
<br />
Affliction seems almost the same to me, with random soul shard generation going from corruption to Agony, with only 1 filler to cast between dots. If they buff the dot's damage to do the same damage as they do now when haunt is up, it can be a boost in PvE and PvP, but I highly doubt that will be the case. PvP wise I see it as a bit worse than now, since haunt and drain soul was your only way to push some damage and be a threat for the enemy team. Drain Life might make you a bit tankier when they don't interrupt you, but who is gonna bother with a class that is no threat at all.<br />
<br />
Destruction was the spec I mainly used. The changes seem like a joke to me. Conflagrate is our shard generation ? Only 5 seconds to cast 3 Incinerates ? So if you soul shards work the same as live, you start with 4 shards. You precast chaos bolt -&gt; immolate -&gt; conflagrate -&gt; 3x incinerate -&gt; chaos bolt -&gt; conflagrate -&gt; 3x incinerate -&gt; chaos bolt -&gt; conflagrate -&gt; 3x incinerate-&gt; pray to God immolate critted and gave you a soul shard for chaos bolt -&gt; conflagrate -&gt; 3x incinerate -&gt; pray to god for immolate to give you a soul shard ? And the dmg you dealt is based on the RNG mastery ?<br />

Unless it has some talents that makes it more similar to the way destro worked in wotlk. I want voidwalker to give shield again and to be able to fast swap between pets. Also CC needs to be fixed, because to chose between howl, coil &amp; sfury broke our class pvp-wise. But sure, continue to give us new abilities then nerf them, then remove them from warlock and give them to other classes. Do they even know how devestating it is to see other classes being twice as strong and running around with spells we originally got? (Running&amp;casting was a lock thing at first, that talent is crap now + hunters &amp; mages run around while casting. Hunters not even being able to interupt without a stun. Our chaos bolt is a weaker starsurge, and balance druid gets procs so that it is instant, but our chaos bolt needs a extra resource AND is the longest cast in the game. Also got more heals. Like... I dont even.) I dont want destro to be about heals, more about shields.<br />
What I see between the lines of these blog entries is just the same as when wod &amp; mop was here &quot;we want to remove as many abilities as possible&quot;, these talents that they talk about WILL disappoint everyone.

Other than demo's new gameplay looking fun everything else looks boring. Destro's losing the theme of burning embers makes no sense, soul shards seem tacked on whereas burning embers seemed to fit the motif of &quot;destro lock&quot;. On top of that destro's gameplay looks like it'll still be boring, which was the main issue of that over simplified spec.<br />
<br />
Also Will destro be losing it's self heal? Will each spec get the soul burn mechanic like they use to have back in cataclysm, because we all know it well that was...<br />
<br />
The whole &quot;let's just tack on soul shards to all specs again&quot; seems like a big step back from making each spec unique and different. Not saying it's not going to work, but theme wise I think it just seems like they're going backwards from where they were with each spec having a unique resource that help define what each class was about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Demo is now entirely focused on pet based damage and now we have the ability so summon even more demons on demand. No longer tied to Meta for damage, which never made sense to me.<br />
<br />
Affliction DoTs can now deal enough damage by themselves instead of requiring Haunt application, which I felt limited our potential multi-dotting ability. Affliction was pushed towards high single target damage with the DoTs needing the amp and they simply buff up the filler. No longer. Drain Life sounds fitting for a filler as well.

Really? I couldn't tell. DO THEY COMPLETELY IGNORED WHAT IS SAYING? No, they did not. However, you are not &quot;everyone&quot; and just because they didn't change what you wanted or expected doesn't mean they didn't listen. It either means they didn't agree or &quot;everyone&quot; isn't as everyone as you believe.<br />
<br />
I'm personally not happy with the tentative changes to affliction. I think it plays well now in a PvE environment. It flows well for me and I don't have a lot of downtime where I'm wondering what to cast next. BUT. This is a preview. It does not include all abilities and it can not possibly include all the tweaks, changes, reversions, complete redesigns, etc. that are bound to happen in the next 6 months to a year. I'm not going to freak out, insta-reroll and say that the class I've mained since vanilla is SHIT from a preview of a xpac that isn't even in beta.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moyga</div><div class="date">2015-11-11, 01:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, they have dramatically reduced the skill cap of all of the specs and added more RNG that takes control away from the player. They keep reducing the performance gap between average players and more skilled players. For example, with the new Destro mastery it seems like it will be pure luck whether it procs on your chaos bolt or your immolate and whether you get good procs during the right times or not, massively changing your parses pull to pull even more than how it is right now. They also removed the ability to triple shadowburn cleave with havoc which was one of the only things that raised the skill cap of Destruction. Backdraft no longer has stacks. Unclear whether FnB still exists.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Apparently FnB and Shadowburn are talents and you can triple shadowburn cleave with havoc. The way the Mastery works is a little less RNG than it sounds but still more RNG than the current mastery.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Expat</div><div class="date">2015-11-11, 03:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">These Warlock changes are very uninspiring. It seems like Blizzard are determined to undo everything that Xelnath achieved when he revamped the Warlock class and gave each spec a unique identity. <br />
<br />
Affliction: Now has Zero direct damage spells? Ever since the removal of Dot Snap shotting and Skillcaps gameplay in general, this has been one of the most boring specs in the game to play and looks like it will only be heading further down the casuals-must-be-within-2%-of-pros path. <br />
<br />
Demo: This looks interesting and quite different... but I thoroughly enjoyed Demo with its complex stance dancing, resource management and burn phases (And before that with its snapshotting) so I am sad to see they have decided to go in a new direction. Seems like its becoming another &quot;death by a thousand cuts&quot; spec where you don't feel like your doing much damage. The thing I most liked about Demon Bolt was the IMMACHARGINMYLAZERZ feeling as you had to position yourself well, line up buffs and you got rewarded for it with big numbers. Also sad to see metamorphosis go, whatever the devs say about &quot;summoning&quot; versus &quot;becoming&quot; we all know its just because your trying to give Demon Hunters demo's art. <br />
<br />
Destro: Not sure changing Burning embers to soul shards makes sense. Also dislike the idea of adding more RNG into the spec that players have no means of artfully controlling. This spec could do with some new mechanics or something interesting to the rotation - its very boring to play. Strongly disagree that it doesn't need any work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Haha, I see a lot of these types of comments, and I can only assume this is from people who have not played during The Burning Crusade xpac. These changes are almost identical to how locks USE to be back in BC, and I LOVED them back then. Locks were not OP during this time, but if an intelligent played played his character well, he could drain tank while doing some nasty damage. But as soon as that lock slips up and gets near a melee class...lights out. I loved drain tanking, especially when questing/leveling, pulling massive mobs, dotting, drain tank, and capitalizing on the XP. I can't wait for BC 2.0!:cool:</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Multiabuse</div><div class="date">2015-11-11, 10:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Demo &quot;sounds&quot; fun but trying to get a sense on just how often one can use these abilities and I feel like they will be few and far between. Unless there is another, as yet unreleased way to gain soul shards, we are gonna be doing a LOT of shadow bolt casting to slowly build up shards.<br />
<br />
Assuming like Aff they regenerate out of combat over time we start with 5 (why 5 now idk). If we use them all on a HoG + Implosion (say for big trash AoE) it will then take 12.5 seconds of casting shadowbolt to get us back to full to repeat this fun sounding imp explosion mayhem. On Bosses the whole HoG+Implosion will be too costly to even bother with, considering the rotation will be summoning+buffing+shadowbolting/doom to recoup the shards. Jury is still out for me until I see it in action. Shadowbolt taking as long as Chaos Bolt to cast is a bit silly imo...<br />
<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, CB costing 2 shards means no more pooling up 4 embers (or shards now) and unleashing CB after CB inside of trinket procs. I liked being able to fire off 4 chaos bolts in a row without worrying about anything else. That cycle is cut in half by what I'm reading. Going to have to hope Immolate crits or save the Conflag charges for a CB dump to get anywhere near the burst it has now.<br />
<br />
Really really hope I get a beta key. Never been more interested in seeing if what they have on paper and actual gameplay meet expectations. I was very unhappy with Warlock changes coming back to WoD after a break in SoO. It felt like they not only nerfed our damage (something which was needed for sure) but also stole the fluidity of all of our mechanics and made them much more cumbersome (Aff Soulburn+SS costing 2 shards.... Drain Soul only refunding 1 shard... made for a VERY shard starved and unpleasant experience). Idk trying to stay positive...<br />

Please please please give us a minor glyph to transform these poor imps into Gnomes. I wouldn't feel as cruel with a spell that sends gnomes in to blow up my enemies as I would sending innocent imps. Also, instead of a meteor if the gnomes could all be loaded into a tiny wind up clown car rigged with TNT the spell would be perfect. Blizzard has been CC'd on this.</div></div><hr />

Kind of wish they would have kept Corruption to have it work as a damage amplification for Hand of Guldan, Demon Wrath, and Imp'sfiend Grasp (talent shown because that is what it is, and Implosion sounds underwhelming) for a slightly higher aoe skill cap, but it seems interesting enough. <br />
<br />
Also does Incenerate take the place of a complete filler, with no soul shard generation mechanic now? <br />

WTB the ability to capture souls outside of dungeon/raid environment and be able to use them as a Intellect Potion alternative.<br />
