Do you guys think they working on racial flying mounts or sumthing? I mean, Teldrassil and Undercity going down - Forsaken Bat and Nelf hippogriff coming up?<br />

And it looks like an updated model for the original Hippogryph mount instead of the new ones they use. Thats nice I always prefered the original armoured ones over the newer ones.<br />

Azerite is looking great though. It's like a bunch of both Artifact Major Traits and Tier Bonuses. Look forward to more coming out and to see if different Raid tiers will add Azerite Perks that are different to change things up.</div></div><hr />

Yeah they really should get DKs. I bet they don’t because Blizz is worried about everyone rolling a DK to get heritage armor</div></div><hr />

<br />
If that is Blizzards logic, then that is silly. Getting 1-60 is the shortest part of the journey to max level. Monks still get their daily exp boost for example but they still let a lot of the new races be monks.<br />
<br />
As a DK main, I really do not care for all these allied races being locked out of DK.</div></div><hr />

Wowhead is reporting they can be:<br />
<br />
Dark Iron Dwarves can be Warrior, Hunter, Mage, Monk, Paladin, Priest, Rogue, Shaman, Warlock<br />
Mag'har Orcs can be Warrior, Hunter, Mage, Monk, Priest, Rogue, Shaman<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
This has two easy solutions: don't let Death Knights get the armor; or don't give a shit, because Monks already have a similarly huge leveling advantage and that seems a-okay.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You do realize these are AU Draenor orcs, right?<br />
<br />
AU Ner'zhul is dead and the orc clans of AU Draenor never got into creating death knights the way the MU orcs did. They have never experienced Ner'zhul creating death knights or the lichking creating death nights and thus have no death knights. Plus, if Blizz is going to use the logic of new DKs being created then Panda and every single Allied Race would need to get the DK option.</div></div><hr />

The fiery darkhound with the armor above seems to be the official DI unlock quest mount.

Why would Dark Irons be Death Knights? They never left Blackrock Mountain (Outside of Brewfest Raids) until Cataclysm. The scourge never went that far south.<br />

You don't really know what a Placeholder is, right<br />
<br />
These things datamined are not placeholders but likely the traits that will go live, with just a few numbers tuning (of course, as most are showing &quot;0&quot; as value). Maybe some of course will be completely scrapped but they are not &quot;placeholders&quot;.<br />
<br />
And these ones are lazy. Hopefully, maybe raid azerite tiers (??) will be a bit more interesting but from what we can see now, we can't really be optimistic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Any reason why she can't teach to them how to be a &quot;priest&quot;? <br />
<br />
Is something that got me crazy... why the hell a race to be in touch with others races, cant be interested in study another kind of discipline. <br />
Dont make any sense...<br />
<br />
and btw, how can Mag'har Orcs be monk? <br />
<br />
Also, on WoWhead both can be priest!</div></div><hr />

This is based on the Draenor Clans. What do you think Shadowmoon Clan was, if not a mix of mages and priests?</div></div><hr />

It's clearly for Shadowmoon clan, so orcs that were harnessing Void powers. If you played in WoD as Alliance you would see it quite clearly. Gotta say their portrayal was very good and I'm happy they're a thing. a Nice distinction from other orcs.</div></div><hr />

*its class specific not spec (traits on armor wont change , when you change spec)<br />
* For example if i am playing paladin and i am in ret spec i see prot and holy traits too and they are shared<br />
*so really in most rows theres only 1 choice: the one thats for your spec<br />
*you cant change trait after selecting one.<br />
* For offspecs , if youi want same armor you need to get same armor twice or three times and just select different traits</div></div><hr />

Maybe because it is a Night Elf mount?<br />
<br />
Undead also gets a new flying mount, the bat or gargoyle or whatever it is called.</div></div><hr />

I’m hoping all the DK class hall stuff is opening the door to more DK options in the future. /fingerscrossed</div></div><hr />

That's pretty exciting stuff. I had not seen anything about a new undead mount.</div></div><hr />

That only explains a third of the complete package called &quot;Priest&quot;. I can imagine Discipline Priests as well (lashing their targets to make them feel less pain overall, that kinda thing), but even this is kinda reaching, and for the life of me I can't see Holy Priests as Orcs, of any form.</div></div><hr />

Any game forum needs to have an ignore feature. Any time a user posts something full of low IQ whine, you should be able to ignore them so the interesting forum discussions I want to spend my time reading are not polluted with crap from small minded idiots.</div></div><hr />

Edit: Oh well they just updated the models.<br />
Do you guys think they working on racial flying mounts or sumthing? I mean, Teldrassil and Undercity going down - Forsaken Bat and Nelf hippogriff coming up?<br />
Maybe that bad flammy doggie can sprout wings, like the hearthsteed or the Suramar kitty cats mounts for example.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking this one don't have both oars in the water<br />

New NPC chat!! :D<br />
