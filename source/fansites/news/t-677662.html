Thanks for putting the shitty stream on the front page, even my alienware machine struggles to handle this crappy stream projection. <br />

I hate it when MLG streams come along, not because of the stream prompts (I don't wanna watch it, so i push one button and scroll down...is that really so hard???) but because of whiny-ass people like this.<br />
<br />
These video pop-ups are here EVERY TIME you check here...?<br />

The HD audio problem now appears to be a freezing problem after a few seconds of flawless play. I'm currently surrounded by at least a dozen intense looking tech team members that are working on this. Again, we will have this fixed and everyone here apologizes for the issues.<br />

Wait...you paid? You paid real money to watch people pvp? No one has a problem with any other company charging to watch douchebags pvp..but when blizzard introduces something for you to buy..for 10$...like say a pet...you want to burn them at the stake.</div></div><hr />

- If you think the quality is shit, pay for it. Nothing is for free in this world, get over it. Also, the HD quality is 10x better this time around than it was last time.<br />
<br />
- For the ppl whining that &quot;omg its at the top of my screen everytime i go to mmochamp&quot;... If you have that problem you are refreshing the page too many times. Also, MMO-champion.com is free for you to use, so expect ads/popups. As i said, nothing is for free in this world.</div></div><hr />

Last time around they were talking about how good it was to finnaly see some decent support from online viewers, and the benefit it would have to thier cause of getting the wow PVP into the higher end MLG status. They talked about how they had the small tables off to the side, and if the high amount of viewership kept up they would someday have the main stage for this stuff.<br />
<br />
This time around, they gouge us for 10 bucks or we cant see the names and spells of the chars or even make out the most basic graphics of the fights. Thanks for giving back to the fans.</div></div><hr />

Yes it is. Try watching it. MLG are ripping the piss out of the wow fans out there and trying to gouge you for 10 bux. If you can't spot this deliberate ploy you either a) dont care, b) are actually blind (how are you posting here :?), c) a stooge posting. Yeah their HD stream is better than last time but holy shit $10 to watch it?<br />
<br />
I'm not even going to get into my stride about octoshape.</div></div><hr />

All the same, saying the word &quot;Alienware&quot; in a sentence is looking to get targeted; you're paying for a name, 'cause honestly, you can find prebuilt machines that're the same specs as an AW machine for a fraction of the cost (the machine I'm on was $750 and, at the time I purchased it, inline with $2000 AW machines for hardware). It's not always about not being able to afford something but sensibility and laughing your ass off at people who're willing to pay two and a half times the cost because something is &quot;cool&quot; (and shitty, since it was bought out by Dell and the overall quality:price has gone down). <br />
<br />
That said - the stream's a problem, but hell, it's easy to avoid it. AdBlock or NoScript on a real browser. Problem solved.</div></div><hr />

Given that preferences are subjective, these statements are a bit of a surprise. From old clichés such as 'beauty the eye of the beholder,' to Adam Smith's argument that a central planner is not needed to obtain a socially optimum distribution of goods because each person has his or her own set of preferences, and profit maximizing firms will seek to accommodate those preferences, to mundane dining experiences where one person says he enjoys meat well done, and another says she enjoys it medium rare, one can see that the notion of differing preferences is common.<br />
<br />
To criticize someone for enjoying a stream of a WoW tournament to the point he or she would pay for it is on par with criticizing someone for enjoying American football or cricket to the point he or she would pay for it. It misses the point to try to wiggle out by saying, &quot;Sure, but that's different because uh... because it's football and it's widely accepted that a lot of people pay for it.&quot; Making fun of someone for a purchase of, say, a pass to view a WoW tournament only 'works' (and I use that term loosely) because it's making fun of a stigmatized group. There is no conceptual difference between paying to watch a PvP tournament of some type, or paying a monthly fee for a game, or paying for a video game when one could walk through the park for free--the list goes on and on. It's all just an expression of preference quantified in monetary terms.<br />
<br />
Also, as an aside--you all realize you're on a forum for--wait for it--a mmorpg, and you're making fun of people for being nerdy by 'wasting' their money on something you think is nerdy and laughable. I don't want to shock you, but some might 'wonder what kind of loser' plays a game like WoW. Worse still, there are probably WoW players who 'wonder what kind of losers' are so obsessed with the game they frequent news websites about it--horrifying, I know, but I fear it's the truth.<br />

The point is that you shouldn't have to let security addons handle occasional annoying stuff on an otherwise trustworthy site. It just undermines the respect that MMO-Champion has.<br />

Nobody would complain over a simple 480x200 banner, but this thing takes up a whole 1024x768 screen.<br />
<br />
I'm considering to reduce my daily visits to the front page from around 10 to 0.5-1, luckily I think we probably won't see any more PTR revelations in a while, maybe not even before it goes live.<br />
Or wait, I can just RSS this forum... not that many people would get ideas like this.</div></div><hr />

Ok first of all do not ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever everrrrrrrrrrrrr use lines from the greatest tv show ever made, How I Met Your Mother, again. Its not funny when you or anyone else does it and it is an insult to that show. Moving on. <br />
<br />
You cant compare it to going to a football game or any sporting event. If they paid money for a ticket to go to where the event is taking place, then yes you could. Paying to watch this is the equivalent of someone paying to watch football on tv. You also cant really compare football to video game player vs player. You watch sports because you appreciate the athletes you are watching. You watch pvp...because...I cannot even think of a reason.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It stops being a revenue stream when the player on the front page makes many of your visitors stop visiting the front page, thus skipping the ads that are there. <br />
<br />
Yes, they can do what they like on their own website, but every time those streams go up, there are floods of complaints about people having to skip the front page, seems massively counter-productive to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
These video pop-ups are here EVERY TIME you check here...?<br />

I have ad block built into my brain. It's called &quot;not giving a shit.&quot;</div></div><hr />

The beautiful thing, if you are not satisfied on any level - dispute the charges. The credit card company (or paypal) will usually side with you 100% of the time. Not to mention, especially for credit cards, the company that charged you will get hit with a $20-30 chargeback for each dispute. So if the service is crap, they'll figure it out quick as the costs start racking up.</div></div><hr />

Add both of those to your AdBlock list if you don't want the stream every time you go to the homepage.<br />

I'm just making an assumption here, but streaming the MLG tournaments gives the site mad kick backs from the stream sponsors (Old Spice, Dr Pepper, etc). MMO-Champion puts up the stream to pay the bills to host a forum for people to bitch about putting up a stream on their forum.<br />
<br />
<br />
Once people start realizing that MMO-Champion and MLG are one in the same, then hopefully these complaining threads will end. Like Psilo said, MLG doesn't charge us for using MMO-Champion, so this is one of the ways it draws revenue from the site.</div></div><hr />

All your foreign games dont count as sports, just men in shorts running around each other.<br />
more like BASE-BORE. if i wanted to watch something incredibly slow and boring I would watch paint dry or watch old people play bingo. hockey is where it's at my friend..</div></div><hr />

Totally defeats the point of an interactive game if all you are doing is watching other people play it. Probably why I have no interest in sports in general, waste of time. I really hope there aren't people out there that idolize these people, that would be ridiculous. Along the lines of idolizing pro sports players.</div></div><hr />
