Today<br />
<br />
<br />
The team is looking at how tapping works in the outdoor world. Rather than one person hitting a mob and getting it, it would be nice if several people could tap it to get credit for quests and loot. No need to group with people you come across when questing. Open tapping will remain for larger NPCs like quest and world bosses.<br />
<br />
<br />
July '14 <br />
http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1561740-Mob-tapping-system-stays-Blizz-feels-it-encourages-social-gameplay<br />
<br />
<br />
There's no question that when spawning or quest objectives are not handled properly on our side, the tap system can create negative and anti-social experiences, wherein seeing players of your own faction nearby becomes a nuisance. We very much want to limit and rectify those situations. The most helpful thing you can do in that regard during beta is to bring to our attention specific quests or areas in which you felt competition for spawns was overly detrimental to your experience. We have a number of ways of fixing those problems, ranging from simply adding additional spawns, to dynamic spawn thresholds that ramp up density as player density increases, to making specific targets open tap.<br />
<br />
The main reason we don't embrace a fully open-tap world is that we feel that those mechanics are asocial. To be fair, that is certainly better than antisocial - no question there, and antisocial experiences usually reflect spawning and mechanics that we need to adjust. However, while a world in which everyone runs around damaging things a few times (or however much is needed to qualify for credit) may be one in which you don't feel bad about other players being around, at some point it also makes those players nearly indistinguishable from NPCs or bots with decent AI. You don't need to talk, or ask if someone has room in their group or would like to join yours. You just attack a few times, and then move on. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, mob tagging rules inherently reward and encourage social gameplay. Even in solo areas like daily quest hubs in Mists, we'd commonly see transient pickup groups form for the sake of efficiency, and stick together through that hub or maybe even another (&quot;hey, anyone up for Klaxxi after this?&quot;). But once again, it's incumbent upon us to make sure that we avoid situations where that is outweighed by negatives like competing for underspawned quest targets or objects.<br />
<br />
Philosophically, for a while now, we've made sure that any time multiple players are sent to kill a single specific target that has a respawn timer (be it named quest boss, world boss, or an event like the Battlefield: Barrens commanders in patch 5.3), the mob is open to credit for all. We're certainly open to extending that treatment where it makes sense, and where it serves to improve the overall experience. But I wouldn't expect a wholesale overhaul of our tap mechanics in the near future.</div></div><hr />

lol someone got angry. What's the matter, you got offended because someone thinks flying isn't as critical to the game as you do? <br />
And too bad Cata and MoP had no content near the end of the game. WoD had little content from launch, and will have 0 relevant content till Legion releases. At least back in Cata and MoP, they had patches worth playing.</div></div><hr />

I think they mean that you can switch between all your specs at any time, not just between two out of three and if you want the third you need to go back to your trainer and unlearn one of the two and select another, like you do now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have people really not put 2 and 2 together to see that the artifact chooses the spec for you? It's just like FF14.<br />
<br />
If you want to heal on your druid (and use healing talents), equip the resto druid artifact. If you want to tank with tank talents, equip your tank artifact. It will actually be nice to just equip a weapon and everything will change, including gear. This isn't class homogenization, it's just making it easier. At least that's what I'm understanding.</div></div><hr />

I don't necessarily want it faster. Larger chunks of content that last longer would be fine. What's most important is that they consistenty support the expansion with new patch content.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I wouldn't even really mind if there was a bit of a content drought at the end of each expansion if it was because they gave us three or four really big patches. I'd rather have 14 months of lots of patch content followed by a 10 month drought than yearly expansions with nothing in between.</div></div><hr />

Every bit of lore right now points toward Alliance and Horde characters saying, to quote Varian, 'For Azeroth!'. They've put no new BGs in, no word about world PvP. Language barrier is still there apparently, but DHs won't have that as they'll be able to communicate in Demonic.<br />
<br />
Will we (ever) be able to group across factions for PvE content, or even just raids and guild chat?<br />
<br />
All I want to be able to do is group and guild across faction. I'm not talking care-bear world peace hippie happy land. I'm talking about being able to do what NPC factions have done all the way since vanilla WoW (Argent Dawn, much)... say 'We've got bigger problems than Alliance vs Horde' and group and guild with opposing faction members. There's still conflict, there's still PvP. Rift did it wonderfully. It's been a fluke of circumstance that all the friends I've made have been Alliance for the most part. I've always wanted to experience Horde content, but leaving my guild and friends behind would suck. Just... want to log on as my Tauren and still be able to run dungeons with my friends when I hit 100.</div></div><hr />

Its where a hardcore guild/raidgroup splits their raid into, say two raidgroups, consisting of 50% mains and 50% alts. Both groups give all the loot to the mains in each group to gear up the main characters as much as possible within a reset.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, it seemed that my question popped up. I don't know if I'm happy or disappointed at it but, like I said, specs could be changed at the swap of weapon.<br />
<br />
Take for example Warrior class, Spec are the weapon you wield not this imaginary tab you click from time to time. You need dual wield for Fury, You need 2 handed Weapon for Arms and you need a sword and Shield for Tank<br />
<br />
So in essence the WEAPON itself is a spec and this in itself eliminated the need for Class specification similar to FFXIV which done in itself, I can see how this works but I think the Specs will remain until level 100 and then the weapon itself is in the form of the class specs, when you reach level 100 and beyond you should be classed as a &quot;hero&quot; class.</div></div><hr />

Nope, the spec you choose is the weapon you wield, you don't get to play heals, tanks and dps all at once, this should be the case now since your a level 100 not a freaking level 10 which you been playing since vanilla.<br />
<br />

More and more people want to play and maintain alts, so the team is aware of the need to make things faster when you play it again. <br />
<br />
There's an easy way to do this, nominate one of your characters on the server or your account as your &quot;main&quot; and this character should be a representative on yourself on the forums and so forth in game and outside the game anything involving blizzard and World of Warcraft site. This would be quite interesting as the other characters are considered alts and blizzard can then therefore speed up the process on other characters allowing skipping cutscene and other bonuses when you play other characters other than you main... Maybe see your main with the main story quest giver, or maybe assisting you time to time..... adding Easter Eggs and feeling more immersed in the game.<br />
<br />
And if you want to change your &quot;main&quot; do an Blizzard bastard route and charge them a fee for doing it and I would support this cause you know screw those people who flip flop all the time.</div></div><hr />

The handful of classic illegal servers are faking it with MySQL and a BestBuy sale special box in someone's basement or closet. <br />

<br />
&quot;Guilds are very important to the social structure of the game. It would be ideal if you could be in multiple guilds at some point, one for PvP, one for Raids. Maybe a secondary guild system? Still in progress.&quot;<br />
<br />
Good that they're looking at that, I've been saying for a while a single-guild system doesn't work anymore - players want to have a reason to be in a guild, but if you're in a guild that's all friends who raid, but you want to be in a PvP guild, the only way to do it is to have alts. Secondary and tertiary guilds are a good thing, or have a structure like guilds for raiding and social, and clans for pvp. Now that guild perks are gone, there's really no reason to make it so impactful to be in one guild. <br />
<br />
A lot of this stuff is not worth getting too attached to - the whole &quot;secrets of Dalaran&quot; sounds like the blather Kosak was going on about in the WoD Q&amp;A, that never materialized (Blood elfs and paladins).</div></div><hr />

Be interesting if the mythic raiding scene survives another expansion at 20m TBH.<br />
<br />
Did you actually to listen the answer? The root cause is the isnt around the number of people in a raid. The root cause is guilds and the fixed number requirements. There is always point where you don't have 20 people to raid. Or if Mythic was flex the right number for the optimal break-point. Which was also referred to in the answer. <br />
<br />
They see the problem, but unlike a majority of the population they are looking at the root cause of a problem and not a quick fix which just pushes the problem out for a few months.<br />

Think long-term for once and apply some critical thinking.<br />

It's a meme, so they have to address it so they seem like they're cool and in on the joke. It's dumb, but it surely does not affect them getting content out quicker...<br />
<br />
I have two questions...<br />
<br />
-What is Split Raiding?<br />
<br />
-Wtf does this mean? &quot;Nefarian will get an update for a Demon Hunter class call, maybe using double jumps.&quot;<br />
Your first question was already answered by someone. As for Nefarian, it's mainly a joke at this point. Nefarian as a boss in BWL (yes, the level 60 raid) has an ability where he singles out entire classes and makes them do something that is iconic to their class that either buffs Nefarian in some way or hurts the raid (similar to a mind control, but not). Obviously, there are more classes now then there were in Vanilla. They went back and added a DK &quot;class call,&quot; and even a Monk one too.<br />

Versatility has a defensive component, useful for PvP, tanks, not a fantasy problem. Each stat should have a special identity and purpose. Do people hate Versatility because it is not strong enough or because of how it works?<br />
How about because it's boring as hell? Doing everything x% better is not interesting. That's what gear is for, not an entire type of stat.</div></div><hr />

I have to agree. This kinda breaks basic logic - classes are banded together to fight common enemy, but... cannot communicate to one another. How exactly do you think they can work together? By pointing fingers? Drawing signs? <br />
And, of course, the NPC's who always were able to do that. For the players, well, &quot;Makes some strange gestures&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let me just say: I read Versatility as though it were a missing value. It being on my gear means I have a missing stat. That means any gear with versatility on it(far too much of it) is immediately useless. SO yes! I hate it because it has no value and because of how it doesn't work. It's negligible enough to just remove with 0 impact. &quot;Each stat should have a special identity and purpose&quot; - versatility has neither. My hunter PVPs. My Paladin and Warrior tank. Most of my other toons are heals. <br />
<br />
For it to be of use to say, my hunter, it would need to be MUCH stronger. <br />

<br />
Splitting up raids between mains and multiple alts. Say you have 20 players, 5 go on mains and 15 go on alts. You can then funnel all loot onto those 5 players. You then repeat this 3 times, cycling through alts and mains. This way you get more loot on mains so you can get through content faster. It's a lot of work because not only do you need to do a raid 4 times, you also have to maintain 3+ alts well enough so they can raid high end. Top guilds hate doing it but it's necessary if you want to go for world first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Moonkin spec will get a revamp<br />
new druid talent : all others specs, you chose 1 and got some major spells from it. Example atm : guardian who pick balance receives moonking form<br />
<br />
Demonology : spec will work like the bonus set T18 , examples given : hand of guldan will proc imps (up to 5), others spells will proc others demons<br />
along the cycle waves of demons proc , some weaks, some more powerfull<br />
No new demons, art team is using the new demons art, takes too much time to create specific art for a class for pets<br />
<br />
Holy priest : Most big mono heal spell in game, half life non crit, can full heal if crit, long CD<br />
<br />
Per spec UI ( bindings ) are coming<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
Death knight : 6 runes , no 2 2 2<br />
They spoke about a new mechanic, a delayed effect from hits, you put a debuff on the target which become wounded, the wound effect only proc later in combo with another spell<br />
Shaman : no more mana, maelstrom ressource, classic ressource builder/depleter<br />
Marksmanship : no more pet<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
they want you to chose a spec and stick with it<br />
have 2 top specs will require a lot of work however 1 powerfull and 1 slighty less should be ok with the catchup mechanic<br />

I'd really appreciate it if they made Reputation Account-Wide, that's the main reason I quit... I hated being forced to play a Class I don't like, PURELY because all of my achievements/time was spent on grinding Reputations on that Character (some Reputations that are no longer possible to even get) thus forcing me to continue on them if I want to get the top end Rep Achievements, instead of actually playing the Class I ACTUALLY want to play... -.-&quot;<br />
<br />
I played/raided with a Class I hated for 7 years out of sheer laziness to reroll (it was so slow back in Vanilla to level,) then I played a [different] Class I didn't want to for 2 or so more years (I liked it at first, but it wasn't really where my heart lied)... Now I finally play the original Class I wanted to play all those years ago in Vanilla, but didn't get a chance to play due to a twist of fate, and if I do so I lose all of my prior accomplishments and can't enjoy my favorite part of the game (rep grinding) because I'd have to redo it all.. &gt;_&lt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can make anything you want up but in essence regardless of the 98% of &quot;other content&quot; you want to do. IT was the Garrisons that killed WOW.... So much promise yet so much broken in just one part of the game, your playing essentailly one character and garrison should of been either account wide or server wide by the least. Having 7 Qina Moonshadows doing the same mission 7 times along with 7 Harrison Jones and 7 Garonas on different alts does massively impact on the immersion of the game and makes you feel like a third rate wheel rather than involve you in the quest against the WOD. You felt more alienated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-no flying for first half of year +<br />
-no legion in azeroth old oznes which woudl allow to renew them and make them relevant again - big big shame blizz such a chance wasted :(<br />
-loads of rehashed old content aka karazhan etc<br />
-next expansion will be probably wolk bis since hwy not after all bolvar is ocming back<br />
-mythic still 20 man and usless they learned nothing out of wod raiding<br />
- guilds still usless as cross real pugging is more beneficial <br />
-class halls will eat up shitload of resource and allow their dev team to claim that we wont get 3rd raid tier cause shitty class halls<br />
-destroyable keystones - cant wait to see drama and no liefer crying - &quot;omg you scrub you costed us keystone we worked weeks to upgrade cause something irl came up ? /gkick:<br />
<br />
will be as shitty expansion as wod if not worse<br />
<br />
but nobody cares cause &quot;doublejump&quot; <br />
<br />
you deserve the shitty expansion you are getting one after another for not forcing blizz to make better gameo nly accepting anything they throw at you<br />
<br />
Loads of useless whine here.. but one thing will probably be a valid concern later on, and that's the destructible keystones... I also foresee a lot of drama around failed and broken keys, blamegames and whatnot..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well- Quality of content always starts to degrade over time in video games. Subscribers in WOW are paying for the quality of service overall. Not just for the box that is thrown out every 2 years. Subscription based game HAS to provide this quality of service over time or they will loose their subscribers. If a subscription based game can not hold their subscribers and looses half of the player base every time - but the devs still talk like they are thinking about quality control... then they are hypocrites. <br />
<br />
Players that are subscribing to WOW now are staring at 15 months of nothingness ONCE AGAIN. There is zero quality in that. Cause the game is SUBSCRIPTION based... not just buy the box based.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Obviously having no new content for over a year is the opposite of good quality. Don't know why anyone would defend Blizzard on this one. Reminds me of people defending their partner even when she or he beats them.<br />
<br />
Having all 3-4 specs easily available will be cool. It still comes down to how easy it will be to keep two artifacts as upgraded as possible. Can't imagine having to choose between feral and guardian. Having to do it with the ring now has pretty much made me stop playing feral and soon the game.</div></div><hr />

Just look at the legion website . 2 of them 100% gets alot of story. So im pretty sure that the no was to no alliances chars dying. Not for no story.<br />
<br />
Remember all of the questions in the q&amp;a were known to the devs aswell as the answers.<br />
<br />
Alliance characters are definitely going to die. The question was answered sarcastically and Heroic Alliance Sacrifices are pretty much a staple for Warcraft. However characters can have poor deaths/disappearances too such as Alleria, Turalyon, &amp; Admiral Taylor. The last two expansion had terrible Alliance story despite a &quot;Alliance fistpumping moment,&quot; &quot;character development for Varian,&quot; and &quot;the full might of the Alliance being brought to Draenor.&quot; What happened was an absurd &amp; controversial threat, the cowing of faction leaders to show how mighty &amp; wise Varian is, and Ashran respectively. The fact that a few Alliance characters get blurbs on the Legion website means more likely that they get characterization through Books, Comics, youtube videos, or short stories in lieu of actually seeing them do anything within the game or gameplay. The question which bluntly address a legitimate Alliance lore concern was dismissed casually and not given an answer. At best I expect WoD's lack of Alliance lore and at worst I expect MoP's treatment of making the Alliance completely irrelevant to the overarching story. To expect anything better within the game is to disregard the historical trend of dismissing the Alliance lore/characters.</div></div><hr />

Regarding extending the tapping to open tapping for more mobs.<br />
<br />
I would say that the tapping the current open tapping (of larger mobs) actually promotes anti-social behaviour to some extent, so I'm hoping that they actually find a better system if they extend open tapping to all mobs.<br />
<br />
At least anti-social is how I would describe it when you fight one of the open tap mobs and someone else does one attack (which increases the hp) and then runs off to attack other mobs, herb or whatever - knowing that they will get credit (and keeping you busy for longer).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it promotes alittle better behaviour in an MMO. You won't feel like shite if you see another player in your vicinity. When you were out gathering or questing the presence of another player was not a fun social thing. It was a bother. At least now you will feel like playing with others in an MMO.</div></div><hr />

As long as it's a new dungeon and does not alter the current karazhan in any way, then that's perfectly fine. I'm sure tons of players would love to revisit karazhan. If they changed the raid into a revamped dungeon like they did with ZG/ZA, then lots of people will be pissed. Especially since it drops a mount.</div></div><hr />

It should be the first time walking raid. The experience is worth it for players to experience, if they weren't around when it was current, it's one of the best showcases for storytelling in a raid they've done - and it's a fun raid. <br />
<br />
There has to be a way for them to keep both versions, like they did with the Blasted Lands and the WoD intro quests.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I want dual spec to be removed there is no use for it and why would you want to be unique from other class? Your already unique enough from other classes, just by being that class !!! Sure you can look different but I rather have the 4 specs on hand due to the weapon + your already lvl 110 you all should have access to whatever spec whenever just by equipping that weapon type. If your level 10 I can see your point but the game has to evolve and being lvl 110 you can't use the same old system.0<br />
<br />
Also you can wield many weapons why aren't you being unique and wielding a 2 hand mythic mace with inferior stats rather than than 2 hand sword with the superior stats, you already done a Non Sequitur fallacy just by not doing exactly that, it just doesn't follow all your doing is min-max cause your required to do it and using transmog by being unique? It doesn't follow at all.<br />
<br />
At least in legion they are enforcing different specs by weapon slots by different weapon types as everyone hasn't noticed yet.<br />
<br />
DKs have mace for blood<br />
Dual wield for frost<br />
Sword for unholy<br />
<br />
Druids have Polearm for balance<br />
Dual Wield daggers for Feral<br />
Dual Wield Gloves for Guardian (like in WC3)<br />
Staff for resto<br />
<br />
and so forth they are using all the resources and the various weapon types the class can use to distinguish from one spec from another, getting sick of doomsayers saying &quot;WE should all spend half n hour going to the trainer to change specs&quot;<br />
<br />
This is more like saying &quot;Mommy, please don't allow this I want to be unique cause then people can play my spec probably half the time and do it much better than I can&quot;... you lot have a lot of insecurities and it's showing in this thread.<br />
<br />
I have a feeling half of you don't know how to play the game properly yet.<br />

<br />
I wouldn't write off the game just yet.... The having all specs all time is quite interesting, imagine an Ashran type battleground with this (bar the &quot;Various fixes&quot; which blizzard done to make the battleground boring as fuck).<br />
<br />
Anything could change in a minutes notice. Not enough healers? After a losing a grand scale battle people swap weapons and become healers changing the next battle and flow. It would be much more dynamic as you can't read what is going on and would be more of a constant rock-paper-scissor evolving battleground rather than one-side stomping the other.<br />
<br />
But probably you like that having one-sided battles, I'm more interested in this all specs at all times and I hope it works out the way I think it is. It would make the game much more dynamic and less boring.</div></div><hr />
