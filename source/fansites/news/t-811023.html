Cataclysm Raid Progress - All Bosses Dead!<br />
The russian guild Exorsus (http://exorsus.ru/) defeated Nefarian in 10-Man mode tonight, 25-man attempts are crippled by a respawn bug and I guess it's pretty much the same thing since Blizzard stated that 10-man and 25-man raids should have pretty much the same difficulty. Congratulations to them!<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Paragon (http://www.paragon.fi/node/179) killed Nefarian shortly after, also in 10-man mode. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blackrock Caverns / Throne of Tides Loot Upgraded<br />
All the items from the first dungeons in Cataclysm have been upgraded! The first tier of items had a pretty low ilvl and Blizzard decided to boost them from ilvl 279 to ilvl 303, the stat gain is considerable and it might be a nice help for people trying to meet ilvl requirements to enter heroic instances. A few examples below.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Somewhere over the rainbow ...<br />
Due to the insane pressure from the thousands of people sending me messages about this, I decided to news the most powerful item of the expansion: Rainbow Generator (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/65357/rainbow-generator/). <br />
<br />
Everything starts in Felwood with Arcanist Delaris and Do the Imp-Possible (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/28000/do-the-imp-possible/). <br />
<br />

<br />
After a few more quests (it won't take more than 5 minutes if you're level 80/85) you will eventually get the final quest of the chain Open Their Eyes (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/28288/open-their-eyes/), where you will learn that imps are terrified of rainbows.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2010/december/rainbow2_small.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2010/december/rainbow2.jpg)<br />
<br />
The quest will reward you with your very own Rainbow Generator (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/65357/rainbow-generator/), the cooldown is a little long (10 Minutes) but you can imagine how awesome it will look on your next boss kill video when 25 people starts shooting rainbows at the boss to pull him!<br />

<br />
I agree. I dont see to much why it matters when they have a cap on how much we can earn. If they want it to go slower, lower the cap. I can understand them wanting to push slightly bigger guilds (ie, bigger then 5-10 people who are actually active), but my guild gets bent over on that one. only about 7 people have cata and are level 85. and im getting my copy soon. : /</div></div><hr />

Comparing raid difficulty using that standard is going to be a pretty terrible gauge. The addition of heroic mode changes a ton.<br />
<br />
In terms of raid weeks and lock outs, they were both cleared in the first week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only reason Nefarian didn't die earlier is because he despawns when the instance soft resets. Both guilds cleared the instance for the second time this week in order to kill him. That's the reason why both of them killed him in 10 man too. It's pretty hard to get another 25 players to clear the instance again after your mains are already locked out..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, That hunters UI is amazing. If anyone finds out what he uses, I would also like to look into it. xD<br />
<br />
Guild leveling is intended to be a progression that requires effort. Before the change any 10man guild could hit the cap every day.<br />
<br />
Your &lt;Staines Alley Holiday Folk Guild&gt; is not entitled to hit level 25, nor is it going to unless it makes an effort. GET OVER IT.</div></div><hr />

I guess it's first nerf stick because of kids QQing HC's are too hard :) Well, let's see if it'll work, because I think it wont :D Having better gear doesn't mean you can play better, and if total gearscore is higher, people will be able to join harder HC's which equals for me more QQing :)</div></div><hr />

&quot;Focusing&quot;? A big guild with a bigger group effort SHOULD be leveling faster than a small guild. This is called logic.</div></div><hr />

I do get the point that it shouldnt be super easy to powerlevel your guild, but the way I see it the whole point of having the daily XP cap was so that smaller guilds would stand a chance and not just get overrun. This is kind of a big nerf for guild consisting of below 20 players and imo and it doesn't really affect bigger guilds nearly as much. Imo they should just have lowered the daily cap and lowered the XP gain from quest to perhaps 70%-60% of what the quest gives to the player.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, this is pretty awful. <br />
<br />
They have destroyed a small social guild's chance of leveling at a rate anything other than insanely slow now. Forget level 25, level 5 seems like its going to take months and months to achieve at this rate, if it's even possible...<br />
<br />
If they want the leveling to go slower... lower the cap...<br />
<br />
I'm just not sure that this achieves anything else than directly penalizing a small guild that would rather play with RL friends instead of joining some big (but still crappy) guild that has 200 members but only 10 raid a week because if you attempt a 25 man, 15 people people shouldn't even be in there in the first place and then the guild ends up dissolving months later anyways because the name &quot;Lords of Burning Vengeance&quot; isn't cool, so they changed the name to &quot;Enlightened Insightful Light Warriors&quot; (both names are fake, sorry for the run-on).<br />
<br />
I understand the intention of this system, but i think the reasonable way to implement it is to have XP gains scale with guild size and with guild cooperation (aka run a 10 man with 5 guildies gets you less xp per kill than 7 guildies, but still gives xp).<br />
<br />
Big guilds or even medium sized guilds will still have no trouble hitting the cap, but small guilds are absolutely screwed now.</div></div><hr />

This makes me very, very happy.<br />
<br />
Like others said, you can hardly use Naxx as a gauge to compare this..and how long did it really take? Under a week to level to 85 and clear the first raidtier. Done by 2 guilds (one on 10 man, one on 25 man) who raid &quot;professionally&quot;. <br />
Plus: bolding 10 man non-heroic is just twisting the facts. In WotLk it was ofc easier to clear 10 mans because you did it in 25 man gear - and quicker. Now 10 and 25 mans are supposed to be equal in difficulty and loot.<br />
<br />
So there seems to be a step up in difficulty, which the vocal people here were shouting for...lets see how long the heroics take and how fast the community catches up - yet the pro-guilds continue to be as fast as ever before.</div></div><hr />

I'm extremely peeved at this guild leveling crap. <br />
Basically a small guild of say, 20 people who do 10-man raids but are organized and tight are at a severe disadvantage vs a large guild of 300 people who don't even know each other. 300 people questing will earn more guild levels than 20 people running content together.<br />
<br />
That should not be the case.<br />

I agree with a previous poster, lower the cap, not the gains. (100% might be excessive, but 25% is also excessive on the other end.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now that guilds aren't able to cheese 10 mans with 25 man gear, the two raid setups are surprisingly similar. Some fights are easier on 10 man, some are easier on 25 man, but blizzard did a good job (at least this tier) keeping the difficulty the same. To those that say 25 mans are still much harder and have actually attempted both raid setups on this new tier, I'd say you'd might want to look at who you're raiding with in both groups and replace the variables in your 25 man.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd argue 25 was casual.. more resses, less risk when one or two dps die, more loot per boss, bigger range of dps allowing people to be just mediocre and still pass content for gear. Methinks you have the term casual confused with something else.</div></div><hr />

My husband has this UI on his Rogue. I keep forgetting to copy it over...<br />
<br />
Smaller guilds can keep up if they work harder. I personally like the challenge. There are perks for managing and recruiting more people, get over it. <br />
<br />
And yes, I'm in a small guild of about 10-13 active people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to agree with Taiki420, I think you're mistaking &quot;easier to set up&quot; as meaning casual. It is always easier to find 10 skilled players with the same raid schedule than 25. <br />
<br />
There are main things that made 25 mans harder than 10 mans in Wrath, and Blizzard has (for the most part) taken care of two<br /> 
<br />
1. 10 mans were easier b/c you could run them in 25 man/25 man heroic gear, where as there was nothing to overgear 25 mans. Same loot fixes this.<br />
<br />
2. Encounter scaling mechanics were a work in progress, since this was new in Wrath, a lot of encounters (such as Faction Champions) were way easier in 10 man as compared to 25 man, whereas many Naxx encounters (4 Horsemen is a prime example) which were originally designed as 40 man encounters scaled much better for 25 mans then they did 10 mans. Blizzard has worked out most of the scaling problems in the first Cata tier raids, although some still exist and it can never be perfect.<br />
<br />
3. Human error. It is much easier to move 10 people out of defile, away from frost tombs, away from ghosts, etc. than it is 25 people. It is also easier to ensure everyone bites correctly, passes plague correctly, etc. when there are only 10 players. Blizzard can't fix this. HOWEVER, if your 25 man raid group consists of 100% skilled, aware, and intelligent players, it will be no different than your 10 man full of 100% skilled, aware, and intelligent players. <br />
<br />
10 player content will always go down faster than 25 player, but that is because most serious 10 man raid groups have to deal with much less human error that 25 man raid groups do.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ever made an attempt on nef 10 and 25 man? Do you know that you need to spread 8 8 9 people on 3 tiny pillars in 25 and 3 3 4 in 10 man? Do you know how intense the healing is, resulting from one or two players standing too near to eachother? No? Then Stfu you inbred hillbilly<br />
<br />
Like I said, scaling mechanics can never be perfect, but it sounds more like you need to kick a few of the people in your 25 man who don't know how to spread out properly.</div></div><hr />

Lol yeah true. The space issue between 10 and 25 man is one I can't argue on, b/c when it comes to the same amount of space, less people always have an easier time spreading out (Blood Queen anyone?), but how many 25 man guilds were able to get the spacing done correctly for that fight and kill her, i'm guessing a lot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard did this before; people that have/had Tier 4 (Karazhan/Gruul/Magtheridon) should remember a similar stat increase.<br />
These items that you have now or receive later are going to have the new stats.</div></div><hr />
