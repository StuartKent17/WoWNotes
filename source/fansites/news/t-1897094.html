Welcome to our World of Warcraft: Legion class preview series. In this entry, we’re exploring the Shaman—to find out what’s in store for a different class, check out the overview. <br />
<br />
We continue our early look at class and specialization design with the Shaman. In these blogs, we’ll be exploring class identity, discussing Legion’s new designs, and presenting core combat abilities for each specialization—laying out the foundation upon which talents and Artifacts will build further. With that in mind, let’s delve into what it means to be a Shaman in World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
For millennia, since the primitive tribal cultures of Azeroth and Draenor, the natural elements of the physical universe have been celebrated, feared, and even worshipped. Mystics sought communion with the earth, air, fire, and water, and learned to tap into their raw power. In time, these spiritual guides came to understand that nature’s elemental forces aren’t wholly benevolent, but have, in fact, been locked in an unending conflict of chaos and primal fury that once consumed the physical realm. So began the calling of the Shaman, to bring balance to these volatile energies, leveraging their intensity to mend wounds . . . or inflict them.<br />
<br />
The use of totems is integral to the Shaman archetype, and we’re addressing some persistent issues with their mechanics. For a long time there have been significant constraints associated with totems, like the fact that they can only be dropped at the Shaman’s feet, or that they only have 5 health, or that no more than one of the same elemental type can be active at one time. While these constraints were intended to ensure that totems felt unique, they ultimately drove us to creating strange tools to allow the Shaman to bypass such constraints, such as Totemic Projection or Totemic Persistence. In Legion, we’re eliminating this awkwardness and simply removing the constraints.<br />
<br />
Totems of the same nature type can now be summoned together, allowing you to have Healing Stream Totem and Healing Tide Totem up at the same time. Elementals are no longer tied to totems, but are guardians that follow and assist you. Totems’ maximum health will always equal a percentage of your maximum health. In addition, totems that need to be placed at a specific location will be directly placed using a targeting reticle. If you want to place Earthgrab Totem in the middle of a big pack of nasty orcs, you can do that without having to run into that nastiness or use a separate spell to throw the totem there. In general, totem mechanics are concentrated around temporary effects (either beneficial or hostile) in a localized area, as opposed to “maintenance buff” cooldowns you need to make sure are up at all times.<br />
<br />
Finally, we’re bringing needed clarity to Shaman resources, particularly to move away from disguising a couple key resources as buffs. Lightning Shield charges for Elemental Shaman, Maelstrom Weapon charges for Enhancement Shaman, and Mana have all been replaced for Elemental and Enhancement with a new resource: Maelstrom. Mana is a fitting Restoration Shaman resource and will remain for that spec.<br />
<br />
Elemental<br />
Certain shaman have dedicated themselves above all else to forging a deep bond with the elements. They have peered beyond the Elemental Plane, gleaning visions of an ancient past where manifestations of volatile energies once raged unimpeded across primordial Azeroth. Through careful study and dedication, the elemental shaman is able to channel such power into destructive magical surges. Through the body of the shaman flows bolts of lightning, as if from storm, and bursts of fire, as if from molten earth. They manipulate the land itself and summon spirits of earth, fire, and storm to their aid. To battle an elemental shaman is to taunt the very forces of nature. <br />
<br />
&quot;Through the body of the shaman flows bolts of lightning, as if from storm, and bursts of fire, as if from molten earth&quot;<br />
<br />
Gameplay<br />
Elemental Shaman already have a strong, thematic ability repertoire. We’re retaining much of that existing gameplay in Legion, while smoothing the rough edges. The previously mentioned switch to Maelstrom as a resource is most significant. Elemental Shaman will build Maelstrom through their Lightning Bolt, Lava Burst, and Chain Lightning, and spend it on abilities like Shocks and Earthquake. This change also allows us to remove the cooldown on Shocks, since they instead compete for resources. Shock usage is now more flexible for Elemental Shaman, such as using more of their Maelstrom on Flame Shock to DoT multiple targets. Another notable change is the return of Elemental Overload as their Mastery; Molten Earth never lived up to our hopes, being too non-interactive and confusing.<br />
<br />
To give you an idea of the Elemental Shaman in action, here’s a basic look at their core combat abilities:<br />
<br />
Lightning Bolt<br />
<br />
40 yd range, 2 sec cast<br />
Fires a bolt of lightning at the target, dealing moderate Nature damage, and generating 15 Maelstrom.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lava Burst<br />
<br />
40 yd range, 2 sec cast, 8 sec cooldown<br />
Hurl molten lava at the target, dealing strong Fire damage. If your Flame Shock is on the target, Lava Burst will deal 50% additional damage. Generates 15 Maelstom.<br />
<br />
<br />
Flame Shock<br />
<br />
0 to 20 Maelstrom, 45 yd range, Instant<br />
Sears the target with fire, causing minor Fire damage and then an additional minor Fire damage every 2 sec. Lasts 10 to 30 sec based on Maelstrom spent.<br />
<br />
<br />
Earth Shock<br />
<br />
10 to 100 Maelstrom, 45 yd range, Instant<br />
Instantly shocks the target with concussive force, causing massive Nature damage, based on Maelstrom spent.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lava Surge<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
Your Flame Shock damage over time has a chance to reset the cooldown of Lava Burst and cause your next Lava Burst to be instant.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mastery: Elemental Overload<br />
<br />
Grants a 40% (with Mastery from typical gear) chance for Elemental Overload to occur. Elemental Overload causes a Lightning Bolt, Chain lightning, or Lava Burst spell you cast to trigger a second, similar spell on the same target that causes 75% of normal damage and Maelstrom generation, and no threat.<br />
<br />
<br />
Additionally, to provide a glimpse at how some talents may build upon this, here’s one example of an Elemental-specific talent:<br />
<br />
Maelstrom Totem<br />
<br />
40 yd range, Instant, 30 sec cooldown<br />
Summons a Maelstrom Totem near the target for 15 sec that repeatedly attacks an enemy within 30 yards for moderate Nature damage. Every time the Maelstrom Totem attacks, it will generate 5 Maelstrom for you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enhancement<br />
Intense communion with fire, earth, air, and water isn’t exclusive to the elemental shaman. In many ways, enhancement shaman similarly bond with nature and leverage its power on the battlefield. What distinguishes them in their training—and in their connection with the elements—is their combat methodology. These shaman favor empowering their physical attacks with elemental energies and facing their adversaries up close. They don’t shy from the frontlines, wielding magically augmented weapons, potent elemental attacks, and totems that shape the tide of battle. <br />
<br />
&quot;These shaman favor empowering their physical attacks with elemental energies and facing their adversaries up close&quot;<br />
<br />
Gameplay<br />
The identity of the Enhancement Shaman is cool, but we don’t feel that the mechanics do well to establish that. We want this spec to be more than a melee-range Elemental Shaman, while having a distinct “Battle Mage” feel. Enhancement’s niche focuses on dishing out devastating spells and punishing strikes at melee range to destroy their enemy. Rather than leaving you with a multitude of buttons, many of which are inconsequential, we’re emphasizing empowering your weapons and allies in the fray. Enhancement Shaman become increasingly deadly as they build their power through Maelstrom generation. They must be careful not to let it overflow, while maintaining enough to utilize their most dominant attacks at critical moments.<br />
<br />
To give you an idea of the Enhancement Shaman in action, here’s a basic look at their core combat abilities:<br />
<br />
Rockbiter<br />
<br />
10 yd range, Instant<br />
Assault your target with earthen power, dealing moderate Nature damage, and generating 15 Maelstrom.<br />
<br />
<br />
Flametongue<br />
<br />
10 yd range, Instant, 12 sec cooldown<br />
Scorch your target with fiery power, dealing moderate Fire damage, and enhancing your weapons.<br />
Each of your weapon attacks cause up to minor additional Fire damage, based on weapon speed. Lasts 16 sec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Windfury<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
Each of your main-hand attacks has a 7% chance of triggering three extra attacks, dealing minor Physical damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lava Lash<br />
<br />
30 Maelstrom, Melee Range, Instant<br />
Charge your off-hand weapon with lava and strike your target, dealing strong Fire damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Stormstrike<br />
<br />
60 Maelstrom, Melee Range, Instant, 16 sec cooldown<br />
Energize your weapons with lightning and deliver a massive blow to your target, dealing heavy Physical damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Maelstrom Weapon<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
When you deal damage with a melee weapon, you generate 5 Maelstrom.<br />
<br />
<br />
Stormfury<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
Each of your attacks has a 2% chance to cause Stormfury, resetting the cooldown on Stormstrike, and causing your next Stormstrike to cost 50% less Maelstrom and to trigger no cooldown.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mastery: Enhanced Elements<br />
<br />
Increases the chance for Stormfury and Windfury to trigger by 5% (with Mastery from typical gear), and increases all Fire and Nature damage done by 40% (with Mastery from typical gear).<br />
<br />
<br />
Additionally, to provide a glimpse at how some talents may build upon this, here’s one example of an Enhancement-specific talent:<br />
<br />
Sundering<br />
<br />
60 Maelstrom, Instant, 20 sec cooldown<br />
Shatter a line of earth before you, causing strong Physical damage and knocking enemies to the side.<br />
<br />
<br />
Restoration<br />
Some shaman find a serene affinity for the restorative properties of water. These shaman do not necessarily seek the Light or turn to the divine, yet they feel a profound spiritual connection with the source from which all mortal life took root. So strong is their connection with water that the shaman is able to restore life and heal afflictions. They balance this with a command of the other elements, finding harmony in nature and purifying their allies as a tidal surge washes across a sandy shore. <br />
<br />
&quot;Restoration shaman feel a profound spiritual connection with the source from which all mortal life took root&quot;<br />
<br />
Gameplay<br />
Restoration mechanics are informed well by the themes of the spec, and we want to avoid disrupting what healers already like about it. What has changed has primarily been in terms of tweaking their gameplay in more fun directions. There’s now slightly more emphasis on targeted healing, and slightly less on Chain Heal spam. We’ve also significantly improved their talents, offering more impactful and varied options. Additionally, Restoration gains the most from the removal of totem restrictions.<br />
<br />
To give you an idea of the Restoration Shaman in action, here’s a basic look at their core combat abilities:<br />
<br />
Healing Wave<br />
<br />
2.1% Mana, 40 yd range, 2.5 sec cast<br />
A slow but efficient wave of healing energy that restores a moderate amount of a friendly target’s health.<br />
<br />
<br />
Healing Surge<br />
<br />
4.1% Mana, 40 yd range, 1.5 sec cast<br />
A quick but expensive surge of healing energy that restores a moderate amount of a friendly target’s health.<br />
<br />
<br />
Chain Heal<br />
<br />
5.6% Mana, 40 yd range, 2.5 sec cast<br />
Heals the friendly target for a moderate amount, then jumps to heal the most injured nearby party or raid members. Healing is reduced by 30% after each jump. Heals 4 total targets.<br />
<br />
<br />
Riptide<br />
<br />
1.5% Mana, 40 yd range, Instant, 6 sec cooldown<br />
Restorative waters wash over a friendly target, healing them for a moderate amount and an additional moderate amount over 18 sec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Healing Rain<br />
<br />
4.3% Mana, 40 yd range, 2 sec cast, 10 sec cooldown<br />
Blanket the target area in healing rains, restoring a moderate amount of health to up to 6 allies in the area over 10 sec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Healing Stream Totem<br />
<br />
1.7% Mana, Instant, 30 sec cooldown<br />
Summons a Water Totem at the feet of the Shaman that heals an injured party or raid member within 40 yards for a minor amount every 2 sec. Lasts 15 sec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tidal Waves<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
When you cast Chain Heal or Riptide, you gain the Tidal Waves effect, which reduces the cast time of your next Healing Wave by 40% or increases the critical effect chance of your next Healing Surge by 40%. Stacks up to 2 times.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mastery: Deep Healing<br />
<br />
Increases the potency of your healing spells by up to 60% (with Mastery from typical gear), based on the current health level of your target (lower health targets are healed for more).<br />
<br />
<br />
Additionally, to provide a glimpse at how some talents may build upon this, here’s one example of a Restoration-specific talent:<br />
<br />
Wellspring<br />
<br />
2.4% Mana, 30 yd range, 1.5 sec cast, 12 sec cooldown<br />
Create a surge of water that flows forward, healing all friendly targets in a wide arc in front of you for a strong amount.<br />
<br />

<br />
I'm the opposite. I found it irritating not having a resource to pool for burn phases and trinket procs and what not. This gives us a tad more control over our rotation rather than just a rotation of &quot;Is it on cooldown? No? Stop being bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Edit: Hopefully</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a changed resource sure, but Elemental is still 95% exactly the same in terms of priority. Instead of Fulmination and Charges, it's now powered by...charges in another form. Still the same core rotation, abilities, etc.<br />
<br />
Enhancement seems to be whack-a-mole again and Resto seems almost exactly the same.</div></div><hr />

I know they can't list all our attacks, but, <br />
<br />
no mention of shocks.<br />
I assume Old Maelstrom is gone? No more LB casting &quot;/<br />
only 1 attack that generates maelstrom?<br />
No mention of totems? :s<br />
what about our wolves?<br />
<br />
there's sooo much info missing from this so really impossible to make up an opinion just from this<br />
<br />
the maelstrom system might be interesting, but what they showed here can't be more than 50% of it..<br />
(if this is most of it, as in, core rotation consists of this + 1 or 2 attacks, this will suuuuck :p)</div></div><hr />

Hope maelstrom will regen passively as well right, otherwise we won't be able to use any shocks to start combat. They didn't bring back lighting bolt on the move, so rip mobility. And still no 2h enhanc, sad...<br />

But, I welcome overload again, much better than boring molten earth.<br />

Will this change our ability to switch to a target and burn it down better? One bummer is the fact that you still have to have a flame shock on a target to buff your lava burst damage. So that is one wasted gcd to do normalized damage on a target that needs to die ASAP. Also it didn't read that lava burst is an auto crit. But looks like we guessed it right old mastery is back. No more floating pebble that breaks cc. Overall I'm not impressed especially when reading about other class changes. Was hoping for a major overhaul cause I feel that ele needs something more. Who knows maybe once I play said spec I might change my mind with talent tree changes and me actually playing the spec. One thing that would make the spec feel more active is if the maelstrom spells where not on the gcd i think that would make the spec feel more busy to me. Anyways my 2 cents but I'm just a humble wow player hoping for a better shammy experience than what I got in WOD.</div></div><hr />

Why would we want maelstrom for resto? Better yet, why would they consider it? They removed holy power already. It looks as though they're stepping away from this route. Will know for sure when monk class preview comes out but it appears to be going the way of the dodo bird and becoming extinct.</div></div><hr />

Based on what I asked, it'll be much like flame shock's 0-20 feature, so you can heal more powerful heals, or have infinite smaller heals. That means the button never goes dark. If you ask me, that's a good design. The question now isn't design (in my opinion), it's &quot;how strong will the costed heal be&quot;, because trade off for damage with a resource system isn't bad, in fact, it's good. But, that pay off needs to be noticeable.<br />
<br />
____<br />
<br />
Beyond that, this chat is ridiculous. It's the same crap every preview &quot;what about this, what about that&quot;. &quot;Where's the totems?!&quot; Come on now. Obviously they didn't reduce all specs to 5-6 buttons and that's it... Use your brains. This is a very basic preview of how classes will play and how they're shaping their fantasy. Expect that there is OBVIOUSLY more to it than what you're reading. It doesn't take a genius to figure out. &quot;Where's the wolves?!&quot; God...<br />
<br />
Also about the PVP stuff, beyond what I said above, it's common knowledge at this point that they're adding an ENTIRE talent system for PVP. A tiny bit of logic will tell you that if there are great PVP changes to come for the Shaman, that'd be a good place to look, so you're probably just going to have to practice patience, but I can pretty much bet that a new layer of pvp oriented talents will be able to shake up the meta.<br />
<br />
And beyond that, the base-talents are being reworked in many areas. We already know the entire totem line is gone, and something has to go there, and beyond that they're trying to diversify talents more through the specs. Simply put, reading 6 skills leaves you 'actually' knowing nothing about how anything is going to play out, so please for the sake of sanity (and credibility) stop with the dooms-day rambling. It COULD be bad, i won't say it can't be. I'm not defending anyone. But please, at least think before you speak.<br />
<br />
But wait, there's more!<br />
<br />
About this Maelstrom stuff. Yes, admittedly, it's kind of a rage bar... But who cares? There's no difference. Your auto attacks before had a &quot;chance&quot; to grant you 20% of your rage bar before (in terms of Maelstrom Weapon), and the skills were better based on how much you used it with. This new system is very little different mechanically than tracking a buff. All resource bars are are a streamlined and cleaner way of handling class mechanics, and if you peel back the pretty ui, you'll realize, they're pretty much the same damn thing with some slight tweaks (in this case, making Maelstrom use less RNG and more predictable).<br />
<br />
Enough ranting, that should be enough food for thought to satisfy the rage-heads. x.x<br />
<br />
Edit: I guess I should say this isn't an outside-looking-in perspective. I've been a shaman since Vanilla, and I'm thrilled I no longer have to play the CD-mash dance or sit still to cast a LB on occasion, and have 50 moves that all barely do anything. I have a lot of hope for these changes. There's nothing wrong with them, at this point the ball is in their court to make it work.</div></div><hr />

Actually, I didn't say &quot;it's beta&quot;. Because even that would be false. People simply have no clue on how anything is going to turn out. People haven't even seen all of the PVP talents or reworked talents (as far as I know?). So no, it's not a &quot;wait and see, things could get better&quot;.

They've had it rough. I DO play shaman. But that isn't my point. You might as well go make a thread &quot;Shaman has always sucked, boohoo!&quot; because as it stands, you still have no idea what will happen in the expansion. It COULD suck, but there's no direct indicators of that with SO MUCH (new) information that isn't even available yet. PVP talents alone can make/break/change absolutely everything about a class placement in PVP...<br />
<br />
Like I said, we're not even at the point of &quot;wait and see and hope it gets better&quot;, people are bitching about 5 skills previewed and abolutely '0' context on what it could mean with a massive amount of accompanying changes. It's pathetic and serves no purpose.<br />
<br />
Quick example, the heal thing that just happened. &quot;Oh god, we only have our heal with resource, no more healing out of combat, we're dead!&quot;<br />
<br />
I hop on twitter and within 5 minutes get a reply telling me it'll work with or without resources and scale. Well that's good news and changes everything about the context of the argument.<br />

No, there's a difference, to me, with realizing in Beta something isn't wrong. I'm not saying prior complaining wasn't warranted... I'm saying THIS QQ is pointless. If you cry all the time, no one will know when to take you seriously, they'll just assume you're always unhappy no matter what.

HardlyWaken is spot on in terms of keeping calm until we actually have ALL of the information rather than a PREVIEW, which is pretty much nothing more than an example, a peek, an overall idea.<br />
<br />
From an enh perspective, I'm incredibly excited about two things: 1) Fuck you totems and your ridiculous limitations/uses; amen totems with reticules from the off. Adios searing totem, you ridiculous thing, and thank the elements -- our elementals don't come from totems anymore! 2) A base rotation that includes abilities that don't have CDs. Rockbiter = no CD + no cost. Lava lash = no CD. And our Stormfury passive, when it procs, gives us TWO Stormstrikes without CDs (immediate reset + next use doesn't trigger CD).<br />

We get zero changes as Elemental, zero changes. We even get something back that they weren't happy with from the beginning. Nothing new. So if you don't play a Shaman or never have, please, stop baiting people here.</div></div><hr />

The fuck are you talking about? Yeah, marks has arcane shot that has no cost and no cd to generate focus. Rockbiter is identical. So much for class identity being the focus of Legion.<br />
<br />
And my issue is that they felt the need to change absolutely everything about the way that Enhancement has worked for years. I proposed something that would be a little bit more in the middle, if they absolutely have to introduce a fucking rage bar. I don't want heroic strike (Lava lash), I don't want arcane shot. If I wanted to play a different class, I'd play a different class. There's no fucking reason they had to overhaul Enhancement when there's nothing with a remotely similar playstyle for those who liked it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At least this is a valid argument. You can be upset that your class is mechanically changing, and sure, that can be frustrating. I guess only time will tell if its a good or bad change in those regards.<br />
<br />
It is important, though, to realize whether you're looking at your Lightning shield buff or a separate bar, in terms of Elementalist, not a lot has really changed. It's just kind of more nicely laid out.<br />
<br />
Enhancement, it's a bit more different, but you're still waiting on one resource versus another for your stronger attack whether it be 5 Maelstrom procs (more RNG) or filling up a bar (less RNG), the end result is similar.<br />
<br />
I think people should at least understand the mechanical differences between the two before deciding to turn up their noses because it's just a &quot;rage bar&quot;, and realize the end result just isn't that much different. If they still don't like it after being educated, they're entitled to that opinion.<br />
<br />
I for one am happy about the loss of the mana bar (free heals ftw! If you don't have any Maelstrom power, anyways). And I like that this new system allows for harder hitting skills as opposed to many skills that don't feel impactful enough. As long as the tuning is right and the PVP talents are good, I think I'll remain happy and optimistic.<br />
<br />

<br />
We get zero changes as Elemental, zero changes. We even get something back that they weren't happy with from the beginning. Nothing new. So if you don't play a Shaman or never have, please, stop baiting people here.<br />
<br />
You have very little changes ROTATIONALLY. That means very little. PVP talents ARE changes (as well as base talents), in which you have no clue about. That's the part that is a problem. you're looking at 5 basic damage spells and pretend you have any clue about how they'll turn out in ANYTHING. You really don't... I've played Shaman since Vanilla. Up until this point PVP talents havent been a thing, so logic tells me, wait and see what happens before I say nothing has changed...<br />

Yeah, marks has arcane shot that has no cost and no cd to generate focus. Rockbiter is identical. So much for class identity being the focus of Legion.<br />
<br />
This response is precisely why I said have a cupcake and a nap. You're not thinking clearly. By this &quot;logic,&quot; then EVERY instant ability in the game is exactly the same shit with a different name. Except it isn't. Or wait, maybe they're turning MM and Enh to the current destro lock. After all, conflagrate is instant and builds burning embers. Unless you're suggesting the GIANT difference there is that conflag costs 1% mana to build embers? Well in that case, destro locks are identical to WW monks, because WWs have jab, an instant ability that costs some energy to build chi.<br />
<br />
Really, you're being ridiculous.<br />
<br />
<br />
And my issue is that they felt the need to change absolutely everything about the way that Enhancement has worked for years. I proposed something that would be a little bit more in the middle, if they absolutely have to introduce a fucking rage bar. I don't want heroic strike (Lava lash), I don't want arcane shot. If I wanted to play a different class, I'd play a different class. There's no fucking reason they had to overhaul Enhancement when there's nothing with a remotely similar playstyle for those who liked it.<br />
<br />
Now you're making no sense at all. Lava Lash isn't new so how is it only NOW that it's heroic strike? Because your resource changed? Are you even hearing your own thoughts before you type them out? Seems you're just pissed off that it's being changed at all because you enjoyed it as it was. That's totally fair, but if that's the case, just say THAT instead of flinging utterly nonsensical &quot;complaints&quot; at the wall.</div></div><hr />

If that is the case this is a good change enhance has needed for a while. With the new resource it's now more of managing that resource to prevent capping and pool it for times of needed burst instead of just smashing whatever ability is off cooldown. Also a good change if that is indeed the case. Healing surge costing maelstrom is a concern with no more maelstrom weapon stacks. Something like what paladins have with selfless healer and judgement they could work into shaman with perhaps lava lash.<br />
<br />
For elemental I have some concerns. Lava Burst still tied to flameshock affects target switching and damage. Mobility is still a concern as well as the issues with EQ still present from the looks of it. Obviously we still have to see if all this is addressed with talents, glyps, other abilities.<br />
<br />
Resto I'm on the fence about I like the healing style but the mastery leaves a lot to be desired in PvE content as everyone gets better gear but also if they do indeed tone down shield absorbs this might not be as big an issue.<br />
<br />
Also both enhance and ele need to be less squishy in pvp maybe the new pvp talent system will address some of that.</div></div><hr />

??? Lava lash is now heroic strike because it's only a rage dump now, it even costs the same amount as heroic strike. It used to have a cooldown, now it has none. It is functionally identical to how heroic strike and maul work.<br />
<br />
The point is that Enhancement has never been about pooling a resource to spend. It's the only spec that you don't have to deal with that garbage. And now for people that like that gameplay, there's no option. No longer supported. Complete bullshit and unfair.</div></div><hr />

Again, by that logic, then any abilities that are &quot;functionally identical&quot; means the classes/specs are identical. We've got lots of identical classes in WoW then. Hell, there are lots of identical classes in a whole load of games in that case. When you peel back the layers of animations, visual effects, damage done, and affects on rotation, pretty much every ability/spell of every class or spec can be compared to another in that way. <br />

Now this I can understand as a gripe, even if I personally disagree with it. That said, given the build/spend mechanic applies to pretty much everyone (at least DPS-wise), I'm not sure it should come as a shock that Enh has been moved to this as well. Unique snowflake blah blah. <br />
<br />
Personally, it makes a lot more sense to me for a variety of reasons than having some seemingly endless supply of an otherwise meaningless resource. How does that even make sense? Resource management, when tuned correctly, can play a big role in class complexity and the gap between button mashers and skilled players, at least IMO. I also find it far more satisfying to be &quot;working toward&quot; some awesome abilities, particularly when that has to be managed around fight mechanics and important DPS targets/burst requirements.<br />
<br />
That said, you're entitled not to like it on principle, but as of now, for all you know, you may end up loving the playstyle when all is said and done (since we currently know very little).</div></div><hr />

It's true. Shamans really will whine about anything. Been playing the class for 9 years, lived through Bus Shock and a new icon as a class feature one patch, but I never really believed we are that big of a bunch of whining babies. Our first real redo since TBC, taking out all the chaff, giving us clear simple play from the ablities we've seen, and there's whining we may be too much like warriors - a class that way, way beats us out in representation and DPS.<br />

It's a shock because they claim that they're trying to make all the classes and specs feel different, but then turn around and give everybody a slight variation of the same energy bar resource system. Uniqueness like the eclipse bar and DK runes? Removed/homogenized. Hell, I hated holy power because I hate combo points/chi, and I'm glad it's going away for prot for that reason, but that's still indicative of cutting down class flavor. The only DPS spec in the game that I like to play that's left is Enhancement after they ruined Arms, and now Enhancement gets butchered too. Enhancement has always been fun as shit to me not worrying about building and spending jack shit and just focusing on proper GCD usage with a priority system with a bunch of hard hitting skills, straight to the point. Good thing I'm a guardian druid, but come tomorrow I'll probably just want to punch a baby after reading the inevitable unnecessary changes.</div></div><hr />

With an attack speed of 2.6 reduced by haste (make no mistake that this class will be haste &gt; mastery stacking) and 5 Maelstrom per white hit you won't be pooling. You'll be trying all you can to spend it before it caps.</div></div><hr />

Holy power sucked, but it gave the class something unique. Even though I didn't like it, it felt different enough from combo points to warrant it's existence, and it just meant that I didn't enjoy paladin, but others did so they kept the system in place for Ret. Maelstrom however, is literally Rage.<br />
<br />

There is no extra resource here. Maelstrom is replacing mana. It isn't the exact same as rage and it doesn't regenerate like energy or focus. Maelstrom is like a mix between rage and runic power from what I can see. You have builders, a buff to maintain, 5 Maelstrom per white hit, and spenders to keep you from capping. Rage spikes with crits, where Maelstrom is meant to be smooth and controlled. The only time Maelstrom should spike is when flurry procs.<br />

<br />
The resource type/system doesn't make class flavor to me, but I can understand if it does to you. Sorta lol. Class flavor, to me, is much more about rotation mechanics, the interplay/synergy of our abilities/spells, how those abilities/spells look and feel (anims, effects, etc.), and the utilities we have. I honestly could give two fucks if we all have &quot;energy&quot; bars. I care about how that energy is used, not that it's a thing.<br />
<br />
For example, Shamans have totems. Shamans manipulate nature. Shamans call on elementals to aid them in battle. Enh shamans use that manipulation of nature to empower their weapons to smash and slash your face off, to call upon the winds or electricity to shut you the fuck up, etc. etc., you get my drift. On that basis, ele and enh shamans having mana made the sum total of fuck all sense to me from a class fantasy perspective. In that &quot;class flavor,&quot; it makes perfect sense that Shamans would have to build up a &quot;maelstrom&quot; to use their most powerful abilities.<br />
<br />
But again, I realize that opinions differ on this sort of thing. What I care about is how all of our abilities and talents will FEEL as we're playing. Do they work well together in a sensible way? Do they feel/look cool? Can we avoid stupid herp-a-derp downtime? When I'm really pissed off and swing this doomhammer at your face, is it gonna truly smash your jaw into your brain or just love tap you on the cheek? THAT's the shit that matters IMO.<br />

Yes, maelstrom is replacing mana, the resource that functionally did not exist. So yes, it is in fact an extra resource. Yes, you have builders, a buff to maintain, bla bla bla all the shit you listed, I can read the blog too. And that's not even close to how Enhancement currently plays. That's the fucking problem.<br />
<br />
I didn't play a paladin until after holy power was introduced, so maybe they were really similar, I can't attest to that. In fact.. that would make sense, considering they were exclusive to each faction originally.<br />
<br />
And yes, I specifically said that holy power is staying for Ret in the post you quoted. I know that.</div></div><hr />

I said lots of Shamans and Druids would disagree with you, and you're blatantly disregarding their opinions and connection to the class/spec simply because you disagree with them. It's not changing it just to change it if enough people who play the class/spec think it needs changing. <br />
<br />

<br />
They aren't just changing things to change them. Enh had a fair amount of clunk and dead spots in the priority prior to this. I agreed with Blizzard's assessment of Enh in that it had a good base to work with and a strong fantasy, but the direction the spec was headed made it feel like a close range Ele Shaman.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, maelstrom is replacing mana, the resource that functionally did not exist. So yes, it is in fact an extra resource. Yes, you have builders, a buff to maintain, bla bla bla all the shit you listed, I can read the blog too. And that's not even close to how Enhancement currently plays. That's the fucking problem.<br />
<br />
I didn't play a paladin until after holy power was introduced, so maybe they were really similar, I can't attest to that. In fact.. that would make sense, considering they were exclusive to each faction originally.<br />
<br />
And yes, I specifically said that holy power is staying for Ret in the post you quoted. I know that.<br />
<br />
Ret and Enh weren't viable until WotLK. So your supposition has no bearing on how the 2 were designed. I love what they have shown for Shamans. I'm amazed at how many people hate the preview tbh.</div></div><hr />

That doesn't make any sense. If people don't like how something plays, they themselves should play something that suits their needs. Specs don't need to change. Why do they have to remove or redesign playstyles instead of add new ones?</div></div><hr />

<br />
They redesigned the playstyle of Enh slightly over time. They felt it was too complex in WotLK so they pruned this spec a bit going into MoP. I feel that the base they showed us has the potential to have the fast paced elemental torrent it once had. I don't think the style is going to feel much different, but the method will be.</div></div><hr />

So what you're saying then is that nothing about ANY class/spec should've been changed, updated, or redesigned since Vanilla release. Gotchya.</div></div><hr />

Once they were all relatively balanced to one another and class representation was relatively equal? Nope.<br />

I'd have absolutely no problem if the specs hadn't changed since Wotlk/cata era. In fact almost all of them were better back then.</div></div><hr />

What I like about Wow is the fact that we can become powerful, solo old raids, go to old zone just for pure story purposes and go through it fast and easy as we are way higher level. If level scaling was a must (not just an option to lvl with a friend when you decide that) then it would feel like we never become really powerful, like in GW2. I remember playing some classes like priest being weaker than others (try compare priest doing solo group quest or hunter doing it) during leveling and then it was nice to have some extra levels when doing a zone, going back later for some harder things. If zones were always scaled to player then such priest would be always weak. Besides it feels discouraging to go to lvl 10 area with full set of epics and be just a little stronger than the actual lvl 10 mobs and players. Just meh. <br />
Yet I think that zone scaling may be nice just and specifically in new expansion as it is only a few zones and it was always boring having to do them in specific order, not having many alternatives to chooose from.</div></div><hr />

This. This all day. I'm so sick of the slow draining mana fights with healers. They should just give healers something like energy, or destro's mana. Runs out quick, comes back fast.

Once again, that's in your opinion. And once again, various people would disagree. And most importantly, since you've been around that long, you should be well aware that Blizz always, always, ALWAYS changes things. If they didn't, shit would get mind-numbingly boring. You expecting them NOT to change shit is a bit like expecting the grass not to grow. <br />

Sorry that you enjoy enh in its current iteration, genuinely, but if I had to play the same iteration of ANY class for 7 years ... well, I wouldn't. I'd rather take a doomhammer to the face. Repeatedly.</div></div><hr />

Yep all of that judgment off a handful of abilities, despite 7 rows of completely redesigned and new talents that we haven't seen yet, many of which devs said will have an &quot;active&quot; talent you can choose to fill up your bars with shit to do if you like that; never mind the artifact weapons with a whole other set of new talents that can drastically modify your playstyle, which we haven't seen yet either.<br />

Yeah, marks has arcane shot that has no cost and no cd to generate focus. Rockbiter is identical. So much for class identity being the focus of Legion.<br />
<br />
And my issue is that they felt the need to change absolutely everything about the way that Enhancement has worked for years. I proposed something that would be a little bit more in the middle, if they absolutely have to introduce a fucking rage bar. I don't want heroic strike (Lava lash), I don't want arcane shot. If I wanted to play a different class, I'd play a different class. There's no fucking reason they had to overhaul Enhancement when there's nothing with a remotely similar playstyle for those who liked it.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, right... Rockbiter also debuffs your target to unlock other abilities, you get RNG single ability dmg burst based on ability usage. Yep, totally melee marks... Srsly? I can understand being skeptical, but this is just generic bitching for the sake of bitching...</div></div><hr />

Your logic is so fucking backwards. They basically remove Survival and replace it with something completely different, plenty of surv players are upset, but at least they gave marks some of survival's mechanics in their talents and such so if you liked survival gameplay it can be preserved in some way. People who like Enhancement? Fuck em, apparently. Guess every melee class has to use a bar and have &quot;builders and spenders&quot; now even if they don't want them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so yeh until we see shamans being wanted in raids, shamans having utility, shamans bringing something powerful and unique, we will sit on our fence with angry faces throwing rocks at blizzard until our trust is earned back.<br />
<br />
I agree with you but shamans do bring utility (try xhul mythic without shamans and grounding totems), shamans do bring something powerfull and unique (bloodlust) but blizzard tried the last two expansions so soften the unique in all classes so that raids bring the players and not the classes.<br />
Of course they fucked up in many things in WoD, changing the uniqueness of our spec (enhance) to be a melee moonkin instead of a single dps legacy we were supposed to be all those expansions..I still miss ToT days..<br />
<br />
The resource change is really really disappointing. I have been playing shaman enhance since it started being viable in raids (TBC) and i never liked resource management classes (rogues warriors) although i was ok with protection warrior.<br />
Now they change the single thing that i had ease of mind in my game. the resource management exists.<br />
So tell me now all of you<br />
<br />
We will have to think about our dps cds (Ascendance, feral spirits, fire elemental) plus! the maelstrom resource. Now i don't even want to think how bad it will be to play mythic progress , keep all this in check plus worry about weird trinkets (soul capacitor and image one) while trying to survive.<br />

I see your point, but I disagree with the premise. First of all, how do YOU define play style? If you're suggesting that the resource-management mechanic is the single defining factor in DPS spec play style, then there is no X, Y, and Z in WoD. There's everyone else and shamans. Some have build/spends in the form secondaries, some have build/regen/spend primaries, some of have burn/conserve primaries, some have more of a ramp-up-type primary, and so on. So is the issue that some people who main Shamans considered them the last of the playable classes because &quot;AAAAAHHH I dun wanna manage a resource!&quot;?</div></div><hr />

O.o removing cooldown from shocks means we finally get to target switch too, that alone is a huge improvement to the class. Mobility still sucks, I agree, but let's see what talents will bring to the table - maybe can enhance ghost wolf to leap to some location, wolves do that! What's the problem with Earthquake (genuine question)? It seems to work just fine since they gave it a visual, no cast time and reduced to 3 targets the max-buff... As for survivability, Astral Shift and Shamanistic Rage are pretty good survivability cooldowns in raid/istances, unless you mean specifically for pvp.</div></div><hr />

See, now that I get. My point is that what you described is a &quot;how the resource mechanic plays&quot; problem (i.e., dev execution on game play) rather than the choice of resource itself. And that's the reason that I think it's PRE-premature to draw conclusions. The only way to decided whether a class or spec has truly been ruined for you is to play it, but to judge it on chosen resource and a handful of base abilities with the plethora of talents yet to be revealed is not even close to reasoned judgment. Until beta and its iterations, any &quot;conclusions&quot; are baseless speculation. And who knows, maybe you won't like Enh anymore but will fall in love with DH or a different redesigned spec. Again, no way of knowing until you play them.</div></div><hr />

Mobility still sucks, I agree, but let's see what talents will bring to the table - maybe can enhance ghost wolf to leap to some location, wolves do that! What's the problem with Earthquake (genuine question)? It seems to work just fine since they gave it a visual, no cast time and reduced to 3 targets the max-buff... As for survivability, Astral Shift and Shamanistic Rage are pretty good survivability cooldowns in raid/istances, unless you mean specifically for pvp.<br />
<br />
On the paper earthquake has an interesting interaction with CL, but it's quite useless if there aren't enough mobs around. Reducing the number to 3 mobs might help, but it's still no real and intuitive cleave mechanic, because you have to manually target the area of effect. <br />
<br />
Not to forget that you will also have &quot;interrupts&quot; in your rotation while placing the new totems strategically on the battlefield.<br />
<br />
I believe these changes will make Shaman's playstyle more stressful and interruptive than ever.<br />
<br />
<br />
While I was reading the class introduction I really hoped for Elemental Shamans to become a pet class for elements like the Beast Master for animals or Demonology Warlock for Demons. :-(</div></div><hr />

<br />
funny, i'm pretty sure it's the other way arround. before, 50% of the specs felt the same. now they change a lot of the spec, so there is now options A - Z, yet of the 5 specs that where playstyle X before, 4 of them now complain that they are now A, B, C or D instead. While they can still reroll to the spec/class with playstyle X if they want to keep that playstyle.</div></div><hr />

Thank you! Somebody gets what I'm trying to say.<br />
<br />
<br />
I see your point, but I disagree with the premise. First of all, how do YOU define play style? If you're suggesting that the resource-management mechanic is the single defining factor in DPS spec play style, then there is no X, Y, and Z in WoD. There's everyone else and shamans. Some have build/spends in the form secondaries, some have build/regen/spend primaries, some of have burn/conserve primaries, some have more of a ramp-up-type primary, and so on. So is the issue that some people who main Shamans considered them the last of the playable classes because &quot;AAAAAHHH I dun wanna manage a resource!&quot;?<br />
<br />
That's WoD. Going into Legion, from what we've seen, there very much is XYZ but it's more like just Y. They're homogenizing a LOT. And yes, partially; people should have at least ONE option of not having to manage a resource and instead focus on GCDs.<br />
<br />
<br />
You know, it's starting to become more and more clear that Blizzard has absolutely no fucking idea what they want to do with Enhancement. Every expansion brings some drastic change that makes absolutely no sense, is clunky as hell, and the playerbase loathes it. Legion is apparently no different.

Word. If I was a developer I would rip my hair off in frustration. Here they are, trying to share their thinking and constructively explaining their reasonings for the changes.

We all know that the system that Blizzard always loved the most was the combo point system (they've said that years ago, they have pride on developing it) and they've tried to put it into other classes (like paladin's holy power). Nowadays they're more and more trying to bring the Diablo 3 &quot;generator/spender&quot; system (the warrior's rage system was adapted to basically be like it sometime ago and now other classes like Shamans are receiving this D3 system) to WoW, plus tons of Heroes of the Storm spells...</div></div><hr />

It has been this way for years now. The new talent system destroyed your &quot;several options&quot; theory. And if you really want to be clear, you'll note that there was always a best practice. Vanilla through Legion, there has always been (and likely always will be) a best practice. Simply put, to get diversity in the tiny amount of talents we have, there are bigger trade-offs (high dps talent/no utility, high utility/no dps, medium utility/medium dps, as an example). This has never not been the case and choices were further eliminated nigh 6 years ago with Cataclysm's release.</div></div><hr />

lots of ways to address this. Can get an ability on cooldown or OOC-only that only boosts maelstrom by a lot; use mana always but reduce cost or cast time or both with maelstrom; add a heal or whatever that is maelstrom only in addition to other heals that use mana, albeit probably less efficiently than now; etc. Analogues for these options already exist in other classes.

Fun twitter convo I had last year about this issue after the change to WW monks<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is being GCD capped worse than being resources capped? More actions per minute = more fun for me&quot;<br />
<br />
Celestalon ‏@Celestalon 26 May 2014<br />
Because it removes timing from the gameplay choices you can make, for the most part. Pooling is a great form of gameplay for some.<br />
That's why we try to provide a mix of different playstyles; some GCD-capped, some not. Something for everyone, hopefully.<br />
<br />
I guess they didn't try very hard</div></div><hr />

They're removing mana for ele and enh. If i go into a fight and i don't have the choice of healing instead of damaging someone, why am i playing a hybrid to begin with?

The problem is the WoW developers have a history of completely ignoring Shaman issues.<br />
<br />
During WoD beta the player feedback was, overwhelmingly, that Shaman was going to have a gigantic DPS issue, and were in need of buffs. The developer response was essentially telling the beta testers that they didn't know how to play their class. The result was Shamans being excluded from groups at the expansion launch because of extreme DPS issues, followed by multiple attempts by Blizzard to buff them.<br />
<br />
So no, I for one have absolutely zero faith in Blizzard anymore when it comes to Shamans. The class has been ignored for years, with band-aid after band-aid applied in attempts to fix it. WoD launch was the final slap in the face for many Shaman players.</div></div><hr />

If you actually do get a stormfury proc and want to put it back on the cooldown, you'd need to hit rockbiter SIX times for both the first cast at a halved cost and the second cast at full cost.<br />
<br />
You guys are welcome to disagree, but I'd take whack-a-mole + the current maelstrom system over this rockbiter-mashing nonsense any day of the week. Honestly strikes me as a clunkier, more awkward version of marksman hunters that's limited to fighting in melee.<br />

You still have the passive which generates 5 Maelstrom per Melee attack, Windfury probably generates Maelstrom as well.<br />
<br />
And there are probably talents which also increase Maelstrom generation.<br />

No offense but that just sounds really jaded/burnt out, I had to take a break for a year for a similar reason.<br />
<br />
There's gonna be weaving between SS resets and whatever talents they're going to add, it sounds like we'll have a lot more control over the rotation compared to MoP/WoD talents.<br />
<br />
Also worth noting is that they (the devs) are pretty sure we're going to have a lot of MP coming in if we're on the target, making note that the challenge is not to overflow. I really don't think we're going to suddenly be swinging it's 2 handed autoattacks at level 5. We don't even know if the MW gain from RB stacks with the maelstrom weapon passive so it could be 20 from RB and 5 from FT before possible passive talents. I don't think we're going to be mashing 1 that much.</div></div><hr />

If dps will be strong there will be no complain whatsoever I'm almost confident about that, enha gameplay was fun for me but not topping dps on single target fights was smthing that used to make me unhappy sometimes only because I felt I had so many things to manage in order to be as close as possible to the &quot;perfect&quot; rotation while most others have 2-3 buttons to spam and some cd...

My only concern since WotLK is the long time we need to pop our CD, IMO should either make some of them off GC either extend duration or lower CD (ascendance) that would solve some problems</div></div><hr />

Can get an ability on cooldown or OOC-only that only boosts maelstrom by a lot; use mana always but reduce cost or cast time or both with maelstrom; add a heal or whatever that is maelstrom only in addition to other heals that use mana, albeit probably less efficiently than now; etc. Analogues for these options already exist in other classes. Fair to assume something equivalent will exist for elem/enhc<br />
<br />
from what i read healing will work without resources to, it will be really weak then tho and get stronger when you spend some maelstrom on it, something similiar to flame shock duration for elementals, also for enh it may be instant but time will show :)</div></div><hr />
