Dev Watercooler – Stat Updates for Warlords of Draenor<br />
In this Dev Watercooler, we’d like to give an update on secondary and minor stats in Warlords of Draenor. A lot has changed since we first revealed our plans at BlizzCon, so this blog will not only cover the latest developments related to what we’ve already discussed, but also go into detail on some new changes we’ve got in the pipe.<br />
<br />
Secondary Stats<br />
<br />
Existing Secondary Stats: Hit, Expertise, Dodge, Parry, Crit, Mastery, Haste, Spirit<br />
As we announced at BlizzCon, we’re retiring Hit, Expertise, Dodge, and Parry. Hit and Expertise weren’t really providing very interesting gameplay, and Dodge and Parry are being replaced with Bonus Armor. Check out the Patch Notes for further discussion on why we removed these stats.<br />
<br />
The other secondary stats—Crit, Mastery, Haste, and Spirit—work well and will be sticking around. One important note is that Spirit will only appear on items for specific slots (fingers, neck, back, and trinkets) and will give a much stronger benefit than it does today. Healers will prefer items with Spirit for those slots, but otherwise will use similar gear to everyone else.<br />
<br />
New Stat: Multistrike<br />
A new stat in Warlords of Draenor, Multistrike (http://beta.wowdb.com/items?filter-multistrike-val=0&amp;filter-multistrike-op=1) grants your spells, abilities, and auto-attacks additional chances to activate. If you’ve been following along since BlizzCon, you may remember that in our early plans, your Multistrike chance would split between two rolls and effectively have a 200% cap. We’ve since changed that to make it more clear and intuitive: the full chance is given to both rolls, with a 100% cap.<br />
<br />
Now Multistrike grants your spells, abilities, and auto-attacks the chance to activate up to two extra times at 30% of normal effectiveness. For example, if you have 55% Multistrike and cast a Fireball that does 1000–1100 damage, you’ll have two separate 55% chances to automatically follow with another smaller Fireball that does 300–330 damage. That means every time you cast Fireball, you have a chance to see one big-damage Fireball, and then two smaller-damage Fireballs leave your hands in quick succession.<br />
<br />
New Stat: Bonus Armor<br />
Throughout the game’s history, some items have had bonus armor on them, which made them more attractive to tanks. After we removed Dodge and Parry, we wanted to replace these stats with a new tank-specific stat, and Bonus Armor fit the bill nicely. As with Spirit, it’ll only show up on rings, necklaces, cloaks, and trinkets. It’s clearly valuable to all tanks, and will be tuned to be much stronger than other secondary stats. Tanks will want to use items with Bonus Armor for those slots.<br />
<br />
Retiring Stat: Amplify<br />
We tried out Amplify on trinkets in Siege of Orgrimmar, and at BlizzCon we announced that it’d be a stat in Warlords of Draenor. The intent of Amplify was to multiply the effects of your other secondary stats. However, as we continued development, we found that Amplify had some design problems. In particular, we determined that it would quickly become the absolute best stat for everyone. On top of that, even if we were to apply heavy diminishing returns, the stat still wouldn’t have an interesting effect on your gameplay. For those reasons, it’s no longer going to be a stat in Warlords of Draenor.<br />
<br />
Retiring Stat: Readiness<br />
Readiness was another stat that we tried out on Siege of Orgrimmar trinkets. This one looked solid at first. Cooldown reduction is a great concept, the idea was well received, and although there were some balance issues, they seemed solvable. However, as we continued development, we hit a snag. Readiness works great in small quantities on the scale of a trinket or two, like in Siege of Orgrimmar. However, when we expand that to a point where you could potentially have Readiness on all of your character’s gear, problems arise. <br />
<br />
Using a damage-dealing (DPS) class as an example, most of the stat’s value comes in letting you use your temporary burst-damage cooldowns (Arcane Power, Vendetta, Recklessness, Dark Soul, etc.) more often. Most of those cooldowns increase damage by 20%–30% while active, which is substantial for a temporary burst ability, but doesn’t compare well against secondary stats. If you stack a lot of Crit and can reach 30% Crit from gear, that’s more or less a 30% passive increase to damage. If secondary stats are equal, you should be able to stack Readiness instead, and get a damage increase that’s similar (or at least close). But how do we give you a 30% damage increase from letting you use a +20% damage cooldown more often? And once you get to 100% uptime, then what? <br />
<br />
We experimented with many potential design changes but never found a version of Readiness that really felt good, so we’re going to shelve it for now, at least as a common secondary stat. You may still see it pop up occasionally in small quantities, such as on a trinket.<br />
<br />
New Stat: Versatility<br />
The removal of Readiness left some space in our itemization plans and room for another stat to take its place. It’s important to offer players plenty of different secondary stats so that you have a wide variety of interesting and compelling gear to choose from. To that end, we’ve been working on a new secondary stat called Versatility. Versatility is pretty simple: 1% Versatility grants a 1% increase to your damage, healing, and absorbs, and reduces the damage you take by 0.5%. It’s a straightforward, obvious upgrade to your primary role’s performance, but also gives significant boosts to secondary role performance and survivability. The healing increase it provides does work on self-heals, such as Recuperate, for example. We won’t be tuning it to be anyone’s highest throughput secondary stat, but it’ll be close, and it’ll give you a nice boost to how versatile your character is in the process. It’ll be especially attractive to hybrids who want to feel more “hybridy.”<br />
<br />
Minor Stats<br />
Most gear that drops in Warlords of Draenor has a chance to have a random bonus in addition to its normal stats. We call these “minor stats,” and they provide a small but useful bonus to your character.<br />
<br />
New Minor Stat: Movement Speed<br />
The first of our minor stats is Movement Speed, which, as you can probably guess, increases the speed that you move by a small amount. Previously, movement speed increases came from enchants and various class abilities, but otherwise never directly came from gear. The Movement Speed minor stat will stack with all other sources of movement speed, but we’ll be keeping the maximum benefit you can get from it fairly low—we want it to feel like a fun bonus when you get it, but not a large increase to character power.<br />
<br />
New Minor Stat: Avoidance<br />
Another minor stat, Avoidance, has previously only ever been used for a few prominent class pets. It reduces the damage you take from area-of-effect (AoE) attacks, though compared to the pet version, the Avoidance minor stat will come in much smaller quantities. The goal is to soften the blow of AoE attacks a bit, but not allow you to just stand in the fire.<br />
<br />
New Minor Stat: Indestructible (previously Sturdiness)<br />
We called this one Sturdiness (http://beta.wowdb.com/items?filter-sturdiness-val=0&amp;filter-sturdiness-op=1) when we announced it at BlizzCon, and its original effect reduced durability damage that you take by a small amount across your whole character. Since then, we’ve renamed it Indestructible, and changed it to cause that specific item to not take any durability damage. We think the change will make the stat more intuitive while providing a similar overall benefit.<br />
<br />
New Minor Stat: Leech (previously Lifesteel)<br />
Lifesteal (http://beta.wowdb.com/items?filter-lifesteal-val=0&amp;filter-lifesteal-op=1) is another minor stat that has been renamed and slightly redesigned since BlizzCon. Our original plan was for it to convert a percentage of your damage done to self-healing. We’ve extended it to work for healers as well, causing an extra percentage of all of the healing you do to heal you as well. With that change, the name was no longer fitting, so we’re renaming it Leech.<br />
<br />
Proposed Minor Stat: Cleave<br />
We announced Cleave (http://beta.wowdb.com/items?filter-cleave-val=0&amp;filter-cleave-op=1) as a minor stat at BlizzCon, but have since run into some problems with it. Most importantly, it was of situational value to DPS classes, always valuable to healers, and had very little value to tanks. As a result, we were concerned it would cause items that would otherwise be equally appropriate for a healer and a DPS class to be viewed as “healer gear,” which isn’t our intent. We’ve shelved it for now, though we have some ideas about how it might show up occasionally in specific cases.<br />
<br />
The Complete List<br />
<br />
In summary, here’s a complete list of our planned secondary and minor stats in Warlords of Draenor:<br />
<br />
<br />
Secondary Stats<br />
<br />
Haste: (Unchanged) Increases attack speed, spell casting speed, and some resource generation<br />
Critical Strike: (Unchanged) Increases your chance to critically strike, dealing double damage<br />
Mastery: (Unchanged) Increases the effectiveness of your specialization-specific Mastery<br />
Multistrike: (New) Grants two chances for your damage and healing effects to fire an additional time, each at 30% effectiveness<br />
Versatility: (New) Increases damage and healing, and reduces damage taken<br />
Spirit: (Unchanged, healer-only) Increases mana regeneration rate<br />
Bonus Armor: (New, tank-only) Increases your armor<br />
<br />
<br />
Minor Stats<br />
<br />
Movement Speed: (New) Increases your movement speed<br />
Indestructible: (New) Causes the item to not take durability damage<br />
Leech: (New) Causes you to be healed for a portion of all damage and healing done<br />
Avoidance: (New) Reduces your damage taken from area-of-effect attacks.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As you can see, we have a lot of exciting changes and additions in the works designed to give you a variety of intuitive and interesting gearing options. We’ll be keeping a close eye on how these are playing out in our alpha and beta testing, and we’ll continue to refine and adjust as needed. As always, we look forward to hearing your constructive feedback!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am however sad to see readiness go, popping cooldowns faster is great in pve but not when people in pvp use it on me :( i guess it's for the best.<br />
<br />
Versatility seems awfully straightforward though, I wonder which spec will treat it as the best secondary stat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Movement Speed: - &quot;we’ll be keeping the maximum benefit you can get from it fairly low—we want it to feel like a fun bonus when you get it, but not a large increase to character power.&quot;<br />
<br />
Avoidance - &quot;soften the blow of AoE attacks a bit, but not allow you to just stand in the fire.&quot;<br />
<br />
So at least 2 of the 4 are going to be arbitrarily limited in their power. I read these as &quot;they're on gear but it really won't make much difference to how you play, nor will you notice the benefit all that much.&quot; <br />
<br />
Why bother?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's almost like they were to play a minor part on gear and a nice bonus if there, but not a big deal if they arent there. That seems fitting for a Minor Stat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It'll add up eventually. If these stats were allowed to be too powerful (like increasing your movement by 15% per piece, or decreasing aoe damage taken by a similar amount), these would seriously screw with the Mythic race and there would be a massive outcry about them being unfair *and* mandatory. But if these are relatively weak, less progressed guilds will gather these minor stats throughout the tier and in the end they'll add up and help with healing checks etc.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">femur68</div><div class="date">2014-06-04, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Versatility sounds terribly boring. Honestly what they should do instead is let versatility be converted into any secondary stat you choose. So if you have 500 versatility and your class likes crit, you can turn it into crit to bolster yourself. Kind of like reforging, but in a stat instead of a vendor. It's not too much more exciting than blizzs idea of versatility, but it's still better than a flat % increase across the board imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The straightforward increase to my primary role is indeed pretty boring, but when i thought about it, it increases your secondary roles too and i found that already more interesting. They could easily tweak the stats to tip the favor toward the secondary roles too. I can see Versatility being very very welcome as a stat that reduces incoming damage for a mage trying to solo old raids for example. Since we dont generally have the offhealing properties that allows us to withstands a boss damage output. <br />
<br />
In that regard, Versatility does something that other secondary stats dont do.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Schwert</div><div class="date">2014-06-04, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Movement speed needs to be scrapped for PvP.<br />
No matter how &quot;minor&quot; they make it ranged are most likely going to be compelled to stack it as much as possible to kite melee and melee in turn need to stack it in order to keep on them.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the night elf racial.<br />
At least that would have been fine if it didn't stack with the boot enchant.<br />
<br />
All these additions seem like they're doing additions for the sake of having them: Which is why they're doing an ability prune in the first place.<br />
These aren't needed and aren't going to do any good.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sierra85</div><div class="date">2014-06-04, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">looks really good.<br />

i think movement in pvp needs to be balanced.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bonus armor feels lame, losing amplify sucks but I can deal. Really sad about readiness going though, that's a real shame they couldn't get it to work.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">YumYum</div><div class="date">2014-06-04, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems like it will be a neutered version of the D3 itemization.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I figured that they would at least have that stuff squared away.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bisso</div><div class="date">2014-06-04, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They always have trouble with some stats scaling to a troubling level, like readiness. Yet they never think about putting them on a static value, like Indestructible is. Basically if you don't want readiness to become too strong, why don't you make these stats on a static pool, no matter the ilvl. So that if you can only have 10% readiness from all the gear slots in the first raid tier, that 10% cap remains by the end of the expansion, and just make it minor.</div></div><hr />

I was thinking the same thing. A couple of them are right out of D3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I fail to see how they COULD make them more interesting without adding silly effects to attacks like unicorns damaging your targets for this and that much or crap like that. <br />
Either way, I'm not bothered. Would've been just as happy with the old stat system, but I bet it being revamped can give the &quot;This game used to be HARD!!&quot;-crowd something new to spout.</div></div><hr />

Not sure how to feel about all this to be honest, Amplify feels like it could've been a stat akin to bonus armor and spirit to me i.e only on rings, necks and the like as opposed to just a trinket as a viable second choice for all 3 roles.<br />
<br />
Also sad to see readiness shelved for now. Think there's a bit too much class diversity to make it an easy to play with stat though. It's literally good for every spec and hard to put it somewhere in small enough quantities so it doesn't make you super overpowered. Maybe make it a consumable/enchant option instead would be ok? Flask of Readiness would be lurvly.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tradu</div><div class="date">2014-06-04, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Versatility sounds incredibly boring. If it's the best DPS stat, you just get free damage reduction on top. If it's not, you take more damage than classes who do have it as their best stat. And of course a stat that's just a direct % damage increase isn't very fun. Same problem with mastery for lots of classes already, which is basically the same as what Versatility is going to do. Examples of masteries that are basically the same as Versatility without the damage mitigation:<br />
Emberstorm(destruction)<br />

Granted, most of those only affect a major part of the specs damage and not all of it, but they're all boring % damage increases(there's other ones as well) to some/most of the stuff the spec does.<br />
<br />
I really hope the minor stats are VERY minor in terms of numbers, because otherwise they won't feel like bonuses but just like thunder/warforged on live, like the BiS and anything other than a trifecta of combat-infuencing(so not Indestructible) minor stats sort of sucks. And no, they're not &quot;just bonuses&quot; when they influence combat in a meaningful way, just like dailies at the start of MoP weren't &quot;bonuses&quot;.<br />
<br />
^^ same thing I posted on the official website. I really hope they just get rid of Versatility just like they did with Amplify.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I'm guessing it'll be far easier to control without reforging or gemming allowing people to just stack Versatility, so they can make sure that there isn't enough of it available on gear to become a problem.</div></div><hr />

Really, Blizzard? Super. Let's have all classes do everything! This will not be unbalanced in PvP, at all. Nope. *shakes head*<br />

Honestly what they should do instead is let versatility be converted into any secondary stat you choose. So if you have 500 versatility and your class likes crit, you can turn it into crit to bolster yourself. Kind of like reforging, but in a stat instead of a vendor. It's not too much more exciting than blizzs idea of versatility, but it's still better than a flat % increase across the board imo.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is actually a brilliant idea! Wish they would do that instead!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think most people are forgetting that you won't be able to reforge in WoD, and sockets are going to be rarer, so the ability to stack a specific stat is going to be a lot less than it is now. How much we all get to stack will depend mostly on what is on the gear we have available, so they can limit how much each class has access to by controlling how many different pieces in a tier have that.<br />
<br />
I agree with the people who say versatility should be removed though, I don't really see the point to it. Everything they've said about secondary stats and why they are removing things like hit/expertise is because they are boring and then they add in versatility which is literally just a passive bonus. Of course you get passive bonuses from other stats but at least with things like haste and crit you have breakpoints to aim for or whatever. There is some interaction with those stats and how you play, while there is none with versatility. Just seems to go against everything they've said and seems likely to be there just because they are set on having 5 secondary stats (probably because they've already budgeted and started balancing with that in mind).</div></div><hr />

<br />
seems like it will create more problems: lets say you luck out and your raid gets a bunch of versatility gear.<br />
<br />
this means 1) your tanks can take a lot more damage, 2) your healers can do a lot more healing, and 3) your raid does more damage while taking less damage (or requiring less healing).<br />
<br />
so odds are, it will allow you to drop more healers since the healing requirement will be lower (your dps take less damage, and your healers do more healing with versatility). cant see this stat working if it benefits you offensively AND defensively.</div></div><hr />

Nothing odd about it. Some gear is supposed to be tank gear, some gear is supposed to be healer gear, some gear is supposed to be dps gear, the rest is supposed to be universal. They didn't want Cleave to make some of the &quot;universal&quot; gear suddenly turn into healer gear - cleave is *always* useful for healers, but only useful for dps and tanks in certain situations. Imagine the cleave trinkets in SoO - if they were turned to be universal, no dps would ever take them but all healers would want them.</div></div><hr />

While I agree with the Leech naming thing, kinda odd, Avoidance is not really gonna be a tank stat. Tanks normally aren't scared at all of AoE effects except in some very specific cases.

<br />
I'd also like to add that having minor stats either be on gear or not be on gear just adds to the RNG of loot even further, similar to D3. Every piece of gear should have at LEAST one minor stat, and be rolled randomly. We shouldn't be rolling for the number of our affixes on gear, because this isn't bloody Diablo.</div></div><hr />

I've been railing against the shit stats since they were announced. Cleave just makes it hard to get gear as a rogue. Go into instance, rogue who takes healer gear blows your damage away. &quot;What's wrong noob? Get a real loot system that lets you take away passive +heals so you can deal area damage, just like me! I'm pro!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Super to not reward that. Best news.<br />
<br />
<br />
Readiness was always awful. Scaling back cooldowns and then also making a stat that just boosts cooldowns? But it doesn't boost the magnitude of cooldowns, it JUST reduces the duration. What's that? Moonkin have Celestial Alignment and that's it? Ok, I guess they were going to:<br />
<br />
1)- Make every class get similar magnitude out of cooldowns, such that readiness could boost it.<br />
2)- Remove EVERY tier that gives you a choice between a cooldown and a passive for all classes -OR- make sure readiness never boosted that cooldown. <br />
3)- Make the game all about cooldowns in the same patch that they delete a bunch of cooldowns?<br />
4)- Scale to an end tier with full cooldown uptime?<br />
<br />
<br />
SO GLAD for these derpstat deletions. They were always abortions, good to know they are flushed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The new stat looks interesting, but I suspect its presence on gear will mean &quot;this piece is for hybrids&quot;. Maybe I'm wrong about that, we'll see. Still, that's not inherently bad or anything.<br />
<br />
<br />

Considering they eliminated dodge and parry for being boring.. then they add versatility and bonus armor<br />

Honestly, all of this feels a lot like ´resilience and pvp power´.. where the devs talk themselves in circles, waste a lot of time, and end up with a system that just keeps getting changed constantly without ever getting much better. How many times have they adjusted base resilience?<br />

How about this devs.. forget everything else. Eliminate hit and expertise, add multistrike and your minor stats.<br />

The minor stats will be pitifully weak and not worth accounting for. Tanks might value them a bit more though (so personally i'd funnel leech and avoidance to tanks).

<br />
more damage done = bigger death strikes = bigger shields. at the same time, you take less damage. so you are essentially &quot;double dipping&quot; on a stat.<br />
<br />
more damage for a prot paladin is essentially useless, as far as survivability goes. only the less damage taken benefit helps them.<br />
<br />
so how do you balance a stat like this which is really good for some people, but not as good for others?<br />
<br />
More damage done does not equal bigger Death Strike heals or shields. Death Strike healing is based on damage taken. Death Knights won't double dip. And I'm sure they will make it so only the Death Strike heal is buffed by Versatility and then the shield is increased via that. Again, no double dipping. See Watcher's tweet:<br />
<br />
@Celestalon @WatcherDev Will dps-&gt;healing conversions (atonement, leeching poison, etc.) double dip from versatility stat?<br />
<br />
@Fierydemise @Celestalon They shouldn't, no. We already have safeguards in place for other damage/healing bonuses. (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/474232019790991361)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
How will multistrike work for DoTs?<br />
<br />
Is there a chance for someone to have 3 corruptions up on a target at once? Or does it take that bonus damage and divide it evenly among the original cast's ticks?<br />
<br />
Each tick has a chance to multistrike. Same idea as the Shadow Priest mastery on live servers or the multistrike trinkets on live. You won't have 3 debuffs up.<br />
<br />
<br />
DK tanks are essentially going to be triple dipping into versatility... More Dmg = bigger DS = Bigger shields, More healing = bigger DS heals = bigger shields, .5% less damage. I see DK tanks stacking this stat as much as possible.<br />
<br />
Damage done doesn't increase Death Strike healing anyway... see my response above<br />
<br />
<br />
Versatility makes me facepalm.... it's like the thing they swore to remove, back and improved!<br />
<br />
The difference is that this stat scales on its own, not off of other secondaries.<br />
<br />
It's still boring, but the scaling issue isn't present and it won't require awkward diminishing returns.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dear Blizzard employee, you have to be kidding!<br />
Removing the interesting (probably gameplay changing) stats and replacing them with something like Versatility AND calling this change an &quot;exciting&quot; one. Which idiot had the idea to implement such a boring stat? April fools?<br />
<br />
HAHA<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baldmonki</div><div class="date">2014-06-04, 08:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a very important question as a resto shaman since end of Wrath (when I began healing and really paying close attention to stats like haste cap, mastery cap, crit for mana etc.). With the addition of these new secondary stats, how many amount of secondary stats will be be available on each piece of gear. Will we get additional rows of stats or will something like haste be replaced by multistrike? I know that they say spirit will be on off pieces - does that mean we will only get ONE other possible stat?<br />
<br />
For example Legs (total of 4 rows of stats)<br />
+Stamina<br />
+Intellect<br />
+Critical Strike<br />
+Haste<br />
<br />
For example Ring (total of 4 rows of stats)<br />
+Stamina<br />
+Intellect<br />
+Spirit<br />
+ ANY SECONDARY STAT<br />
<br />
IDEALLY, I would love 5 rows of stats. Anyone can help clarify? Thoughts?<br />
<br />
Haste: (Unchanged) Increases attack speed, spell casting speed, and some resource generation<br />
Critical Strike: (Unchanged) Increases your chance to critically strike, dealing double damage<br />
Mastery: (Unchanged) Increases the effectiveness of your specialization-specific Mastery<br />
Multistrike: (New) Grants two chances for your damage and healing effects to fire an additional time, each at 30% effectiveness<br />
Versatility: (New) Increases damage and healing, and reduces damage taken<br />
Spirit: (Unchanged, healer-only) Increases mana regeneration rate<br />
Bonus Armor: (New, tank-only) Increases your armor</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demeia</div><div class="date">2014-06-04, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow... 4 minor stats? I find these new stats incredibly underwhelming. <br />
<br />
Also, look at these qualifiers:<br />
<br />
Movement Speed: - &quot;we’ll be keeping the maximum benefit you can get from it fairly low—we want it to feel like a fun bonus when you get it, but not a large increase to character power.&quot;<br />
<br />
Avoidance - &quot;soften the blow of AoE attacks a bit, but not allow you to just stand in the fire.&quot;<br />
<br />
So at least 2 of the 4 are going to be arbitrarily limited in their power. I read these as &quot;they're on gear but it really won't make much difference to how you play, nor will you notice the benefit all that much.&quot; <br />
<br />
Why bother?<br />
<br />
This whole mine they were digging collapsed on them. &quot;We'll give you a bonus to make you happy you're still collecting gear!&quot; Because I'm going to rush out and pay for these new expensive gems along with expensive enchants to change &quot;gearpiece 1&quot; to &quot;indestructible gearpiece1&quot;! (sarcasm) They will get no ore out of this tunnel, that's for sure. <br />
<br />
To be clear: these tertiary stats are intended as bonuses that make us happy (OK, less miserable) that we are farming the same content and over and over. But they have to be worth gemming and enchanting, right? The upgrade system seems to me to have been a categorical success (I admit the devs might see rampant i-level climb as more destructive; perhaps it will be gone). Am I going to have to upgrade my &quot;indestructible chestpice1&quot; so that it equals my &quot;chestpiece1&quot;? <br />
<br />
The only stat they had that actually made a difference to how you play, readiness, has evaporated. I am not being critical about that, per se, it's just that it seems their ideas have just crashed horrifically and they might have been better off leaving things alone.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">digesspliff</div><div class="date">2014-06-04, 08:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Versatility sounds terribly boring. Honestly what they should do instead is let versatility be converted into any secondary stat you choose. So if you have 500 versatility and your class likes crit, you can turn it into crit to bolster yourself. Kind of like reforging, but in a stat instead of a vendor. It's not too much more exciting than blizzs idea of versatility, but it's still better than a flat % increase across the board imo.<br />
<br />
Yep.. it sounds absolutely lackluster. Your idea already looks better...<br />
<br />
Still dont quite understand where theyre going with the stat changes, removal of reforging etc, dont fix it if its not broken?</div></div><hr />

I am however sad to see readiness go, popping cooldowns faster is great in pve but not when people in pvp use it on me :( i guess it's for the best.<br />
<br />
Versatility seems awfully straightforward though, I wonder which spec will treat it as the best secondary stat.<br />

Classes that scale poorly with gear, such as hunters and deathknights</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stats have always had different weights for different classes. Why is it suddenly an issue with Versatility but not with all the other ones?<br />
<br />
Why should every stat have the exact same weight for every single spec? That'd be boring and it'd make fighting over specific pieces of gear even worse. Letting some specs love Versatility while others want haste or crit more allows for raids to distribute gear more efficiently.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Either Versatility and/or Multistrike are totally becoming OP, or totally worthless, in comparison to crit and possibly haste. Simply because crit stands for the slow-strong dps/healing, and haste for fast-weak (yet equal) dps/healing. What exactly would Versatility or Multristrike add? Average-average dps/healing? What's the use for that? Multristrike, Versatility and Crit look like huge competitors of each other in terms of slow-strong output. Haste will probably remain just as valuable as it's now, simply because it's a super reliable and 'fast' stat. <br />
<br />
As for the minor stats, why would you pick Indestructible over any of the other stats? :p It's valuable in gold-terms, but not in any raiding-term, unless I'm missing something :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
What you are missing is that minor stats are rare, and not something you are going to pick or choose between. They are just going to be very rare things tagged onto the bottom of an items stats. They aren´t secondary stats. Like maybe there is a 10% chance that an item will have a minor stat, and then it will be random which one. You will probably have maybe 3-4 minor stats TOTAL on your character at any given time... but maybe towards the end of a tier you will ´upgrade´ to a better minor stat if you get really lucky with a gear slot.</div></div><hr />

Crit / Mastery / Haste (useful for everyone)<br />
Bonus Amor (tank stats)<br />
Spirit (Healer stats)<br />

Movement speed (this kinda change combat)<br />
Indestructible (this only affect gold, doesn't change combat)<br />
<br />
I don't see the points of multistrike, avoidance, versatility, Leech etc. They change the game play / combat in the same way some class abilities or talents already does. <br />
I like how they remove hit, expertise, parry, dodge from gear in WoD and streamline the stats.<br />
But why add more stats that is even more complicated and confusing?</div></div><hr />

Prot Paladin will get increased self heals... and doesn't look like healing &quot;extra&quot; effects (like from DS) will be increased the same way.<br />
<br />

Ideally it should be balanced so it's not the optimal stat for anyone progression wise.<br />
It could however be the best when doing other things such as soloing or actually playing as a true hybrid. Healing and dps'ing as a Moonkin for example (for fun, not optimal progression).<br />
It could become very powerful in PvP yes, but now that PvP gear will be the best for PvP again people should choose PvP gear for PvP. <br />
It will be very easy to limit this stat on PvP gear as there aren't that many different pieces to choose from.</div></div><hr />
