I don't 100% how a hunter should gear up, but since he's usually within the top 3 on damagemeters in one of the best guilds (with one or two rogues over him), I don't really think you are better. :)</div></div><hr />

Funny to see a MM specced hunter these days. Or is Silence Shot crucial for certain encounters in SWP. But when it comes to dps, i think you'll better off with BM. The Trueshotaura buff isnt really 'teh bomb' these days because it doesnt scale (just a silly 'low' amount of AP)<br />

o well, or he respecced to MM for fun after the raid, or he's BM or SV (allthough i doubt the last one because he's lacking agi on certain gem slots..)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Barrage and Improved Barrage, etc give far more burst potential on a more regular basis that TBW. <br />
<br />
That would be my thoughts, but i've not had time to watch the video and check his role yet.</div></div><hr />

IF u have ever checked his spec u would see that it's a pure PVP SPEC and he may wanted to do some arenas with the bow ?!<br />
And about saying it goes to MM hunter i want to ask u if u ever heard for respecing or something ?! he can be every spec he wants.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally it's all about the Agility whereas he prefers the Crit. Could even be his offspec PvP gear with Crit, who knows, but there is nothing bad on his character sheet by any means.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LoL bad! Why in gods name would you want shivering felspine over a shiv of exanguination(SP?)? Additional haste will only mess his rotations up when stuff like dst and quick shots proc etc.<br />
<br />
And Berserker's call?! /facepalm Granted he might want to think about using the Exhalted ashtongue trinket, but other than that his gemming choices are a bit iffy but ah well, why gem for anything other than agility if you dont have to to meet meta requirements? agi scales with kings, provides both ap and cirt and is more dps per gem than gemming for ap/crit.<br />

Looks like that you know much more then he does, of course ::). Ye and where is your own Thori'dal? I think that he is much more skilled than the most of people who commented this. And if you really think the opposite, then you're just silly and stupid imo. :-X<br />
<br />
Stefang walks into the bar, shakes his hands, puts on his Thori'dal and says: &quot;Who said several months ago that all hunters are retards?&quot; Everybody stares at him for a moment with dead silence. :o Massive \kneel and \beg spam in the chat</div></div><hr />

<br />
BM Hunter puts out 3.1k dps on Brutallus<br />
<br />
This is pretty amazing.. I do believe this is the highest DPS of any class recorded w/o any external buffs. I think the best rogue one is at 3k.<br />
<br />

it is not possible to respecc, and he has only 1 set of gear, since for every new pice u have to get rid of the last item u replaced :3<br />
