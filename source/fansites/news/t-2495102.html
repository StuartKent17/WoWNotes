<br />
Resolved an issue that prevented Sap (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/6770-sap) from breaking when specific spells were cast on affected targets such as Concentrated Flame (Essence) (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/302564-concentrated-flame).<br />
The debuff from Crucible of Flame (Essence) (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/298605-the-crucible-of-flame) no longer removes Rogues from stealth.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Companions<br />
<br />
<br />
Players now retain the buffs provided by Neri Sharpfin if they log out and back in during its duration.<br />
<br />
<br />
Creatures and NPCs<br />
<br />
<br />
Increased the health scaling and base health of all the lowest-health rare spawns in Nazjatar and Mechagon.<br />
<br />
Developers’ note: With this change more players will have a chance to engage these rare spawns before they are eliminated.<br />
<br />
<br />
Vengeful Highborne’s fear ability channel reduced to 3 seconds (was 4 seconds) and its duration reduced to 4 seconds (was 5 seconds).<br />
Flight Master Gizzik Kelpears now defends against hostile creatures.<br />
Reduced the spawn chance for Enforcer KX-T57.<br />
The Dopple Gang now spawns when players use the item Pressure Relief Valve (https://www.wowdb.com/items/169470-pressure-relief-valve).<br />
Shirakess Overseer no longer spawns inside rocks.<br />

<br />
<br />
Resolved an issue that caused Memory of Lucid Dreams (Essence) (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/303412-memory-of-lucid-dreams) to break the user’s stealth when refunding resources.<br />
Memory of Lucid Dreams’ (Essence) (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/303412-memory-of-lucid-dreams) Major Power now correctly lasts the full duration for Fire Mages, Frost Mages, and Protection Paladins.<br />
<br />
Developers’ note: The Minor Power on Memory of Lucid Dreams has a custom implementation for Fire Mages and how it interacts with Fire Blast charges. However, this wound up being too strong relative to other Essences’ Minor Powers. As such we’re reducing its proc rate by 33% for Fire Mages, which should keep this as a very strong option to use in the Minor Slot, but much closer to the potency of other Minor Powers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Crucible of Flames’ (Essence) (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/298605-the-crucible-of-flame) Minor Power no longer procs when casting abilities that apply crowd control to a target.<br />

The damage and healing granted from Omnipotence (Azerite Trait) (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/303212-omnipotence) now resets at the beginning of encounters and Arena matches.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fixed a bug that caused the Highborne Compendium of Sundering’s (https://www.wowdb.com/items/169321-highborne-compendium-of-sundering) proc chance to increase if an allied player also had the trinket equipped.<br />
Prismatic Crystals (https://www.wowdb.com/items/167893-prismatic-crystal)[ now stack to 200.<br />
Shaman can now activate Anti-Gravity Packs (https://www.wowdb.com/items/169868-anti-gravity-pack) in Ghost Wolf (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/2645-ghost-wolf) form.<br />
Benthic gear now displays the correct amount of Prismatic Manapearls needed for upgrades.<br />
The Volatile Blaster (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/300892-volatile-blaster) now can be used by Druids in Cat or Bear form.<br />
Harbinger’s Inscrutable Will (https://www.wowdb.com/items/167867-harbingers-inscrutable-will) now pacifies enemies struck by its projectile effect (was a silence).<br />
Druids can use Anti-Gravity Packs (https://www.wowdb.com/items/169868-anti-gravity-pack) in all shapeshift forms, except Travel Form. Flap those wings, Moonkin!<br />
<br />

The &quot;Battle for Nazjatar&quot; (https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/13568-for-nazjatar) event is now active when there are similar numbers of players from both factions with War Mode activated in Nazjatar. When that is not the case, &quot;Azshara's Elite Commanders&quot; —a new event—becomes active and also rewards Battle for Nazjatar Commendations.<br />
The &quot;Battle for Nazjatar&quot; no longer ends prematurely.<br />

Kronus’ and Fangraal's health and damage have been increased in the Ashran Epic Battleground.<br />

The power coils have powered-up, and are now ready to zap shy arena players within the Robodrome starting area who linger too long.<br />
