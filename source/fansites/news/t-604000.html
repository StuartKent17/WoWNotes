Today's news is the first part of the &quot;World of Warcraft 2008&quot; news, during the next few days I'll post compilations of all the things you can expect for 2008, and will most likely go with this schedule :<br />
28 December - Patch 2.3.2<br />
29 December - Patch 2.4<br />
30 December - Wrath of the Lich King<br />
<br />
I might split the Wrath of the Lich King post in 2 parts over two days, because I'm still unsure of how big it will be. Also, the year might end with an &quot;important&quot; announcement, stay tuned !<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft 2008 - Patch 2.3.2<br />
<br />
Patch 2.3.2 will be the first patch of 2008 and will be shortly followed by a minor bugfix patch (2.3.3). Even if it's not a major patch there are a few interesting changes here, and some interesting class balancing. (And this also give me one more day to work on the 2.4 and WotLK posts *cough*)<br />
<br />
Schedule<br />
PTR release - It's already here ! <br />
Live release - Most likely during January<br />
<br />
General<br />
Boat and zeppelin vendors and NPCs are are back on duty.<br />
Reduced network latency by disabling the Nagle algorithm.<br />
/timetest is a command that can be run to provide information on game performance. /timetest 0 turns the command off. When the command is issued, the next time a player uses a flight master to travel, certain statistics will be measured and displayed at the end of that flight. All weather effects and spawns are shutdown during the test.<br />
Effects triggered from being critically hit: Many abilities and talents were changed in 2.3.0 to allow them to trigger from critical strikes that occurred while the player benefitting from them was sitting.<br />
Quest givers with blue question marks no longer show up on the minimap.<br />
NPC's who you have completed a quest for will display a question mark on mouseover rather than an exclamation point.<br />
The bank controls for the guildmaster level of a guild is now grayed out. A guildmaster always has full access to a guild bank and this cannot be changed.<br />
A &quot;Withdraw-Repair Only&quot; button has been added to the guild bank controls. If this is set for a guild rank, then that rank cannot actually withdraw funds from the guild bank, but they can still use that daily amount of money for repairs.<br />
You will now automatically stand up when attacked, even if the attack doesn’t land.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Warmasters/marshals in Alterac Valley now increase each other’s maximum health and damage by 20%. This is a stacking effect.<br />

<br />
<br />
even though the damage is different, the newer damage range is just narrower. The average of 128-193 is the same as the average of 160-161<br />
so even though before the dps could be higher, it could also be lower than the new change but the average hit is what Blizz uses to determine the dps.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brasko</div><div class="date">2007-12-28, 11:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't really feel inclined to copy to the PTR to test... does arcane shot 1-5 gaining bonuses on attack power mean once again that using rank 1 of Arcane Shot is going to be the most efficient way to go? Vanilla, before they removed the bonus, you could get your rank 1 arcane shot to crit for about 750, expending only 22 mana. With T5/6 + equivalent pieces and the massive amounts of RAP you can stack, surely there must be a scale involved.</div></div><hr />
