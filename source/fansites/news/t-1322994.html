Warcraft Movie Teaser at Comic-Con<br />
Fans that were at Comic-Con this weekend got a treat in the form of a Warcraft movie teaser. It was a short clip that featured a human in the desert with a sword who comes across the skeleton of a solider. He takes a drink and then picks up the shield, which has the Alliance insignia on it. An orc then shows up and charges the human, with the clip ending there. <br />
<br />
Duncan Jones also mentioned that filming would begin early next year, so this was just a test shot for Comic-Con. Unfortunately, no recordings have shown up yet, and there are no plans to release the footage...<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
Do you ever get worried about classes being too similar or blurring the lines between what makes every class unique?<br />
Constantly! It's one of the hardest problems for us to solve b/c nobody wants to feel weak in the name of class differentiation. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356134052501262336))<br />
<br />
Can you explain the move back to mana regen scaling with spi/gear? MoP took away mana regen scaling with int, why this then?<br />
The problem with Int was it provided two bonuses for one stat. Spirit is only regen. It comes at the expense of other stats. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357519567788060672)<br />
<br />
Healing is becoming a spam/dps like activity instead of making choices. Changes coming next expansion? Water cooler topic?<br />
It often comes down to mana IMO. The challenge is we get a lot of pressure to buff regen instead of healers having to make choices. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357510089344679936))<br />
As I've said before, the encounters are balanced around class output, not vice versa. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357510262896607232))<br />
But when someone struggles with a fight, the inclination is to ask for class buffs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357510359776628736))<br />
<br />
in fact correct me if i'm wrong GC but didn't you say people have too many buttons to push already?<br />
I highly suspect DS is already on your action bar. It's more about how big those action bars are. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357380902411706368))<br />
Not sure it's a triumph of game design that players feel like they need 4+ bars to bind all of their abilities. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357381055990345729))<br />
<br />
with the constant nerfs to prep/readiness/alter time, maybe it's time you stopped putting cd reset abilities into the game<br />
We agree. I'm not sure that design angle has payed out well. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357145147483504640))<br />
<br />
That is because you design encounters that though out tons of AoE damage. You can't single target heal that.<br />
We actually balance the encounters around the AE healing that groups can do. If we nerfed healing, the other would follow. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356932596581662721))<br />
How about speeding up ST cast time comparatively? So fast ST heals win for 2 targets but AE output wins for 4?<br />
There is logic in that approach since one of the benefits of AEs is the GCD savings. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356940377690865664))<br />
To continue, we don't want every paladin playing like a Resto druid, and honestly neither should you paladins. EF shouldn't be mandatory. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355861121716076545))<br />
so if you dont want us blanketing the raid with hots and shields. Give us back burst healing. What exactly is our &quot;niche&quot;<br />
What do you think you are missing for burst healing? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356133261174513664))<br />
stronger LoD/increased target cap would lead to less EF usage. 3 hp LoD is less effective than 1 hp EF.<br />
But does it lead to priests, monks and druids wanting their AE heals uncapped as well b/c now they're left out? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356164302056591361))<br />
Sanctuary should be getting the HR treatment; 12(?) cap in 25's. 1-2k ticks with 25 ppl in it is sad.<br />
It is extremely unlikely we will change the cap for any other heal as we did for Healing Rain unless it is a raid CD. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356934719553810433))<br />
<br />
Why compare one boring bonus to another?<br />
T16 at least requires you to do something. The T15 could have said &quot;You do 5% more damage.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356934013816012800))<br />
<br />
some time ago single-targets big heals on tanks didnt make healers to feel weak.<br />
I think ST heals on tanks feels like it always has. I think ST heals on non tanks feels like a waste vs PoH, HR etc. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356172163532853251))<br />
Shaman have a strong mechanic to encourage weaving in ST heals to buff AE heals. Maybe others (e.g. Serendipity) need buffs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356172340624760832))<br />
<br />
why have sheilds become the new version of HoTs, in every situation a sheild will be the better option then any type of HoT.<br />
That has always been the case and isn't a design problem. The shields have become too cheap and easy to apply though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356167158713159681))<br />
<br />
Now that we're approaching the end of MoP. What class/classes do you think need a big overhaul in 6.0?<br />
None. We will likely work to make the 3 hunter and rogue specs play a little more differently from each other. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356169971937722369))<br />

Any insight on what you may be doing with Glyph of Efflorescence? Haven't seen it in any builds and it isn't marked NYI.<br />
Not sure yet, but we'd like to try it on the PTR at least. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356174759823802368))<br />

since u nerfed sp survival so much and disperse can be locked is it possible to fix the activation lag&amp;make it work like block<br />
Not sure why there should be unusual lag. Usually that comes from procs. Can look at it though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357515675545239553))<br />
<br />
Stampede buff was a PVE compensation for Readiness removal. Where are the buffs making Hunters coequal to Mages, Wls, Rogues?<br />
We haven't done 5.4 tuning yet. In 5.3 we think mages and locks were often too high. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356173370817134596))<br />
<br />
Just wondering what plans are there to rework hunters BEFORE 5.4, taking readiness away is big, signature shots are quite meh.<br />
In PvE, Readiness just makes opening rotations needlessly complex IMO. Not convinced there is a ton of depth or skill there. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356171023860768770))<br />
<br />
more hunter changes to come? Removing deterrence and adding charges to 2 abilities doesn't seem like an adequate compensation.<br />
We aren't necessarily trying to compensate them defensively. We think PvP hunters need nerfs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356166768953262082))<br />
<br />
3m Deterrence w/2 charges is worse than 2m w/Readiness. This is a big nerf to PVE AND PVP survivability. Intended?<br />
It's 2 every 3 min rather than 1 every 2 min with 2 every 2 min once every 5 min. If that makes sense.... (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356135042688364544))<br />
<br />
Could you please clarify on the deterrence change? Is it generating a charge every 1:30 or one every 3:00 etc?<br />
ATM (which could change) we increased the cooldown and added charges. Works just like Roll or DK runes charging. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356134533592137728))<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/272-Mage) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/mage) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#g))<br />
As a Fire mage -and only when playing Fire- I feel like I need the PoM talent. Will this be &quot;fixed&quot; (if you think it should)?<br />
No promises, but I wish there was room for instant Pyros (Fire?) and say PoM poly (talent?). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357518025219510275))<br />
<br />
why make PoM unaffected by AT? I am assuming it is a pvp change. If that is the case you need to find a new way to balance.<br />
We fear Alter Time makes PoM a mandatory talent for Fire. We're not 100% sold on the change though TBH. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356895986662113283))<br />
<br />
it fair to assume that mages are considered in a good place? I notice they're rarely rebalanced or have talent changes.<br />
Still working on Frost mastery and making sure we don't nerf undergeared Fire mages because of overgeared Fire mages. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356170785175519232))<br />
Overgeared. Is something that should NEVER be said in current content. If that's the case, it's a #designflaw<br />
It was shorthand. Heroic raid balance obviously matters, but very few players have that gear so it's not fair to nerf all. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356889790274207745))<br />

Been meaning to ask. When a Brewmaster Tiger palms there is a gcd delay before the buff to Guard is active. Is that intended?<br />
Procs are sometimes slow. We might be able to rebuild it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356173764121210880))<br />
<br />
what are your feelings and opinions/hopes on the ww mastery changes? Anything to compensate for dps loss?<br />
Yes, we will compensate for the DPS loss. We don't want a trinket to be a 15% DPS gain though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356133139501953025))<br />

Plz allow Holy Pallies to judge friendly targets - will at least make SH more viable<br />
Just so you don't have to switch targets? It's weird to Judge an ally, unless it healed them, which is a bigger change. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357511633561587712))<br />
<br />
SoB is explicitly scaling with melee haste. In practice, spell haste will always be higher for us.<br />
But the point was to make it scale, which it does. Making it use spell haste is just a buff on top of that. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357382347823386624))<br />
<br />
Divine Plea doesn't return enough mana if it doesn't include short duration bonuses. I don't know how much pure spirit u want<br />
Nobody's mana return should scale with trinket procs. I don't think you'd really want this overall. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356896236600700928))<br />
Any time you didn't game the procs like a pro, your mana would suffer a lot. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356896303093002240))<br />
I read that as &quot;if you didn't game the procs like a pro, your mama would suffer a lot&quot;<br />
I like that one better. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357374662293987328))<br />
<br />
Saw a change where Crusader Strike applies Weakened Blows. HotR going away, CS going away or incomplete change? Or wrong data?<br />
Both apply WB. We originally wanted HotR to in the ST rotation rather than just being AE CS, but eventually caved. #acronyms (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356894736591761408))<br />
<br />
I know this is datamining. But Holy should have their version of Sanctity of B. tied to spell haste rather than melee haste.<br />
The only difference really is the raid buff. If we were just trying to buff HS, we could just lower the base CD. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356893787248795650))<br />
(By which I mean haste on gear affects SoB either way, which was the real goal.) (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356893857876688896))<br />
<br />
Datamining shows SoB affecting Holy Shock for all three pally specs. Are we all getting it or is it just a datamining thing?<br />
We are trying it as a way to make haste a little more interesting for Holy. Too early to say if it will be an official change. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356893490619228160))<br />
<br />
Unless this glyph becomes a buff to DP, there is nothing with new DP to motivate glyphing the spell. Delete it.<br />
The Glyph of Divine Plea will have to be redesigned. Considering a glyph to cut CD and mana returned by 50%. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356892853038891008))<br />
<br />
EF is simply easier to use and more effective, SS and SH both require maintenance without worthwhile benefit.<br />
Yep. Which is why we're nerfing it. The synergy with mastery is just way too good given its other bonuses. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356173045292990465))<br />
The periodic of Eternal Flame still should not proc Holy paladin mastery on PTR. If it is, that is a bug. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/355860869407711234))<br />
Just give up on Holy Paladins already. Everyone else with any sense has. #nofun #neverwillbe<br />
If we had done that every times players asked, I think we'd have one spec left in the game. Maybe. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356134179450261506))<br />
Well paladins are pretty useless at this point. No point in bringing them.<br />
They are the most common healer in 25 and second to Disc in 10s. Clearly someone is bringing them. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356172770733867008))<br />
Maybe the EF nerf sends them from hero to zero but I sort of doubt it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356172895686361088))<br />
<br />
This point is simply because EF can handle mutliple targets at once. SS and SH are single-target abilities.<br />
We could make EF limit one again but I don't think that would be very fun. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356171536203390977))<br />
<br />
If you dont want EF to be so &quot;mandatory&quot; why not buff Sacred Shield so it looks more attractive?<br />
We'd like to. What do you feel it needs to compete? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356135114176073728))<br />
SS is already verging towards OP for Protection, It's haste scaling is a big part of why prot stacks haste,<br />
it's possible to buff SS for Holy without making it even better for Prot though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356168965124390912))<br />
<br />
Small throughput buffs are not what paladins need. We need a rework. Mastery is the only thing making us look competitive.<br />
TBH, we hear this too often from every class in the game. The paladin healing toolkit is mostly fine. EF is a crutch. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356132913441542144))<br />
Now paladins aren't perfect. No class is. But they aren't horribly off the rails either as the forums would have you believe. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356133003770085376))<br />
Raid testing proved how bad paladin throughput is, not the forums. 25m raid testing will prove it even further.<br />
Is this proof somewhere we can see and analyze? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356163651234824192))<br />
<br />
Can you give us any insight as to what the current ideas/plans are for Guardian of the Ancients Kings (Holy)?<br />
We want it to key off of AE heals in addition to ST heals. Less use these days in that much ST healing on one target. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356134376460926976))<br />
<br />
can you clarify new selfless healer change? Judgment already gives a HP for all specs. With this talent will it now give 2?<br />
Holy does not get J-&gt;HoPo baseline. With SH, they do. No change for Prot or Ret. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356891022363598848))<br />
<br />
Crit as a possible gearing strat sounds cool. But so does a viable Glyph of Illumination.<br />
We'd be fine buffing Illumination. It's just a short ride from there to mandatory though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356169668433686529))<br />

To even out with an unskilled disc(are there any skilled???) using 8 Raptures, DP needs to return 1200% spirit,not 405.<br />
Rapture isn't really a mana return mechanic. It's a way of getting PW:S cost from cooldown level to rotation level. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356895235336437760))<br />
Honestly, can't imagine any raiding classes running OOM regularly these days unless they (or their groups) are doing something odd. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356895738925559809))<br />
It's very hard to just look at mana %s and make class comparisons. Time to zero mana under a variety of scenarios is more relevant. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356895386151043072))<br />
Then please compare how other healers drop spirit. MW Monks running 7k spirit and finish 100% mana is broken.<br />
We agree that MW and Disc are eschewing Spirit (at high ilevels) that other healers can't afford to do. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357376039086862339))<br />

Still the plan. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357384699624173569))<br />
<br />
Every resto shaman uses HTT, make it baseline. Every holy paladin uses EF, nerf it!<br />
The difference is we think healing totems fit the shaman kit. We do not think hots fit the paladin kit. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356132566580985856))<br />
If some paladins take EF, then that's cool. That's character differentiation. When they all have it, that's homogenization. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356132682004049920))<br />
I repeat, &quot;Every resto shaman uses HTT, make it baseline. Every holy paladin uses EF, nerf it!&quot; Same thing, different result.<br />
I repeat: We want every shaman to use totems. We do not want every paladin to use hots. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356169364417953792))<br />
<br />
Purification once again increases healing done by all water totems. 5.4 notes, I dont understand this one, nothing changed?<br />
Originally we wanted to make HTT less mandatory by having it not do bonus healing for Resto. Concluded that would never work. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356133805649690624))<br />

what brought about the many changes to aff (love them btw)? low pvp rep, considering past seasons?<br />
PvP was part of it but overall we were concerned everything was too dependent on MG. Cool spell but a bit too dominant. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357383681918242818))<br />
<br />
is the new soul link 3% of your dmg split between pet/caster (1.5% each) or 3% on both pet/caster (6% dmg to healing total)<br />
6% total. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356891159932579841))<br />

Thoughts on letting crit rating scale crit block ~ half value of mastery, for prot warriors. ?<br />
We are paranoid about block or crit block chance getting capped. How close are you? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357510910279024641))<br />
<br />
How about making slam consume TFB stacks like OP? That would help arms not have to spam OP all the time.<br />
But what do you then cast if you want to get the stacks to stack instead of consuming them? Heroic Strike? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356889563454648320))<br />
<br />
Any buffs for Arms? Lowest dps spec in the game by a very large marging and under performs in pvp<br />
You are comparing 22k Fury parses with 800 Arms parses. Fury might beat Arms, but you can't compare those means. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356166560374722560))<br />

Weekly News Recap<br />
This was a busy week, with two PTR builds, Proving Grounds, and Timeless Isle, so catch up on all the news!<br />
<br />
<br />
July 14<br />
<br />
We looked at the Season 14 Mage Armor Set (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3307-Season-14-Mage-Armor-Set-Patch-5-4-PTR-Notes-Update-Class-Blue-Tweets-News-Recap).<br />
Death Knight and Druid teleport spells now return the caster to where they came from when cast again<br />
<br />
July 15<br />
<br />
There was another PTR build (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3308-Patch-5-4-PTR-Build-17191-and-Proving-Grounds-Preview) with lots of class changes and new items.<br />
We looked at Proving Grounds, with a preview of the DPS (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i94mzpQirfs&amp;feature=player_embedded), Tanking (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnMjT1_xSt0&amp;feature=player_embedded), and Healing (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3desG5HyFA&amp;feature=player_embedded) version.<br />
<br />
Items are scaled to item level 463, but gems are not scaled down. Set bonuses don't work.<br />
Flasks and food buffs are allowed, but potions are not. You also get a full set of raid buffs.<br />
The UI elements (timers and wave counters) and audio were not in in the videos below.<br />
The DPS video below just shows Gold for DPS, stopping a few waves before the end. This is a somewhat older version of Gold, the current version on the PTR is significantly easier. <br />
<br />
<br />
July 16<br />
<br />
We looked at the Tier 16 Monk Armor Set (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3309-Tier-16-Monk-Set-Moderator-Recruitment-Blue-Posts-25-DK-Mogu-shan-Vaults).<br />
A texture (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3309-Tier-16-Monk-Set-Moderator-Recruitment-Blue-Posts-25-DK-Mogu-shan-Vaults) that might be from the next expansion appeared in a PTR build.<br />
25 Death Knights (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3309-Tier-16-Monk-Set-Moderator-Recruitment-Blue-Posts-25-DK-Mogu-shan-Vaults) cleared Mogu'shan Vaults.<br />
<br />
July 17<br />
<br />
New Cosmetic Helms (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3310-Cosmetic-Armor-Pieces-Now-Available-on-Blizzard-Store-Giveaway) were put on the Blizzard Store for $15 / €12. <br />

<br />
<br />
July 17<br />
<br />
There was a new PTR build (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3311-Patch-5-4-PTR-Build-17205) with lots of changes.<br />
Legendary cloak procs (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3311-Patch-5-4-PTR-Build-17205) were updated.<br />
Siege of Orgrimmar loot (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-build=17205&amp;filter-quality=16) was added.<br />
http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/103649.jpg Xal'atoh, Desecrated Image of Gorehowl (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/103649-xalatoh-desecrated-image-of-gorehowl) was added!<br />
<br />
July 18<br />
<br />
We took a very quick look at Timeless Isle (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3312-Patch-5-4-Timeless-Isle-Patch-5-5-SoO-Raid-Testing-5-4-Notes-Update-Blue-Posts), which has no flying mounts.<br />
<br />
Most NPCs, objects, and gathering nodes scattered around the isle drop Timeless Coins (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/777-timeless-coin), as well as the pet battle (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/33222-little-tommy-newcomer) and lore daily quests (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/33211-a-timeless-question). <br />
Timeless Coins (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/777-timeless-coin) are used to purchase Timeless Caches (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-patch=3388&amp;filter-search=cache&amp;filter-ilvl-min=496&amp;filter-ilvl-max=496&amp;filter-quality=16) for 7500 x Timeless Coin (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/777-timeless-coin), which reward item level 496 gear (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/armor?filter-patch=3388&amp;filter-ilvl-min=496&amp;filter-ilvl-max=496&amp;filter-quality=16), similar to Battlefield: Barrens. You can also buy Mogu Runes (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/752-mogu-rune-of-fate) for 2500 x Timeless Coin (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/777-timeless-coin).<br />
You can also buy http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/101538.jpg Kukuru's Cache Key (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/101538-kukurus-cache-key) for 500 x Timeless Coin (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/777-timeless-coin), which will open any chest in Master Kukuru's cave. These chests contain Timeless Coins and other minor loot. <br />
<br />
The official PTR notes were updated (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3312-Patch-5-4-Timeless-Isle-Patch-5-5-SoO-Raid-Testing-5-4-Notes-Update-Blue-Posts) with lots of new glyphs.<br />
Alts will be able to access Ordos as long as one character on your account has the new legendary cloaks (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-patch=3388&amp;filter-quality=32).<br />
<br />
July 19<br />
<br />
We looked at the new Frost Mage Mastery (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3313-5-4-Mastery-Icicles-Arena-Tournament-Flex-Raid-and-Proving-Grounds-25-Warlock-HoF).<br />
There was a developer post explaining why Flex difficulty has a 540 item level (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/264766-540-item-level-flex-mode-gear-on-ptr/), as well as another that touched on Proving Grounds (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/264700-flex-raidings-poison-pill/).<br />
25 Warlocks were able to clear Heart of Fear (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uhc_7pTR0hg&amp;feature=player_embedded)!</div></div><hr />

can you clarify new selfless healer change? Judgment already gives a HP for all specs. With this talent will it now give 2?<br />
Holy does not get J-&gt;HoPo baseline. With SH, they do. No change for Prot or Ret.<br />
<br />
Crit as a possible gearing strat sounds cool. But so does a viable Glyph of Illumination.<br />
We'd be fine buffing Illumination. It's just a short ride from there to mandatory though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mm.. Opinions differ, what would be your favourite? I think during this expansion the only remotely interesting tier sets have been the Druid ones. I think the colours and design of T3 were spot on, and most of the recoloured ones where the colour differed greatly from the original, were awful. Not all of T1 was great, but they got it right with T2. Theres been the odd decent set since, but a majority have been lazy.</div></div><hr />

But gear has looked like shit consecutively even before transmog.</div></div><hr />

It reminds me of the SWP gear. Why does MMO champ showcase them on male humans though? All sets look bad of them. They look like they are pooping their pants when they run, but even in combat.</div></div><hr />

A lot of people call rogues pussies. So Blizzard decided to give them a glowing vagina.</div></div><hr />

Even if it's only half-helms, I would think the head is a vital part of a person and I don't think I would want it standing out without any protection.<br />
<br />
I'm so glad to be able to hide helms or transmog to something I would prefer instead of showing these helms (past and present, none of them look good if they only half cover our head).</div></div><hr />

I wish I could talk that fast and not mangle words. Sadly the faster I talk, the more I sound like Bloodlust going off or a drunken Murloc</div></div><hr />

None of these sets are really even relevant to the class, they're all bland except priest it's pretty poor imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not just the rogues. Everyone's got a glowing belt of some sort, some more unfortunately placed than others.<br />
The druid set has a glowing leaf-shaped merkin, the warrior set is just a giant arc reactor looking erection with horns. <br />
Am I projecting? XD</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it would help if when showing these new tiers, we see them on other races. It's always Humans. I mean you can click and see more on other page but it's first impression and humans are rather ugly as a race, if I may. That presenter on the other hand.. She is very fine!</div></div><hr />

Not sure why there should be unusual lag. Usually that comes from procs. Can look at it though. (Source)<br />
