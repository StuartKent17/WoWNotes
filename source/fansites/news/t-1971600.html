<br />
We’re pleased to announce a new collaboration with Scholastic, the world’s largest publisher and distributor of children’s books on a new book series for kids ages 8-12 —World of Warcraft: Traveler!<br />
<br />
This epic action-adventure series features a young cast of Warcraft characters discovering the mysteries and majesty of the world around them. Written by celebrated comic book author and animator Greg Weisman, the first book will include full-page illustrations and sketches created by Blizzard artist Samwise Didier, along with a full-color cover illustration by Blizzard artist Stephane Belin.<br />
<br />
The first hardcover book is scheduled for release in November of 2016. Read the full press release here (http://mediaroom.scholastic.com/press-release/scholastic-blizzard-entertainment-announce-world-warcraft-traveler-new-book-series-bas).<br />
<br />
About World of Warcraft: Traveler<br />
It’s been years since twelve-year-old Aramar Thorne, a clever boy who is never without his precious sketch book, has seen his father. So when Captain Greydon Thorne comes ashore and asks his son to join him at sea, it feels as if someone has redrawn Aram’s entire world. Before he knows it, Aram is aboard the Wavestrider with Lakeshire fading to a distant dot on the horizon. But the thrill of adventure quickly fades, as Greydon relentlessly schools Aram on how to handle his cutlass and how to relate with the strange and diverse creatures of Azeroth. In addition, Aram struggles to get along with the Wavestrider’s crew—especially second mate Makasa, a tough teenaged girl who has been reluctantly placed in charge of him. Just as Aram starts to get his head above water, a band of vicious pirates attack the Wavestrider, turning his world upside down once again. As Aram tries to find his way home with his father’s compass in hand, he’ll travel across Azeroth’s beautiful and hostile terrain, encountering creatures both terrible and wondrous. He’ll seek to understand Azeroth’s denizens as he draws them in his sketchbook, forming unlikely friendships along the way. But the journey is hindered by Greydon’s compass, which never points north. If the compass isn't leading Aram and Makasa home--to safety--to what destiny is it leading them?<br />
<br />
About Greg Weisman<br />
Greg Weisman has been a storyteller all his life. He’s best known as the creator of Disney’s Gargoyles and as a writer-producer on multiple animated series, including Young Justice, Star Wars Rebels, and W.I.T.C.H., and Marvel’s The Spectacular Spider-Man. He’s written multiple comic book series and two young adult novels, Rain of the Ghosts and Spirits of Ash and Foam. Greg lives in Los Angeles, California.<br />
<br />
Between this, Snow Fight, and Pearl of Pandaria, Blizz is growing quite a library of kid's books. I enjoyed the others though, so I'll probably get these ones. Will there be new lore in them or is it a more personal story?<br />
I'm not sure about new lore but it seems it could happen incidentally along the way. It's definitely more of an adventure/personal story from a very different perspective.<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
PvP<br />
Will rated arenas and rated battlegrounds reward honor in Legion? (count towards the new honor system)<br />
Yes, rated arenas and battlegrounds in #Legion will award honor - a bit more than their unrated counterparts. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/713082407700664322))<br />
<br />
What's the point of honor when gear is normalized? What's the incentive to grind?<br />
Honor Points contribute to your Honor Level. Each level will unlock more Honor Talents, etc. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/713118492824698881))<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
listening to? Where do you get your feedback, and what makes it more valid than the &quot;vocal minority&quot;<br />
You do see that phenomenon sometimes. Reddit says X but when you talk to more players it turns out to be Y. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/713045488027611136))<br />
But I would not then just dismiss X. It's rarely a binary X or Y decision and the details are quite valuable information. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/713045635411279873))<br />
<br />
The problem is with that statement is every other company bought by a large publisher says otherwise when its over<br />
Well, I've been through this three times now. I felt Microsoft's presence pretty quickly. Not so with Activision or Tencent. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/713045245986865154))<br />

You call that naked? All you see is a belly button, not even a hint of boobs or nether regions (pretty sure she's even wearing a (skimpy) skirt, seeing that fold on her left hip (right to us)). <br />
<br />
Besides, the Tracer pose is removed because it doesn't suit her, not because it's sexy (did you see the pose of Widowmaker? no problems there, because it suits her, the sexy bitch).</div></div><hr />

It's &quot;too much&quot; because there's absolutely no reason to sexualize a character that's in a game about killing people aside from tingling the nethers of teenaged boys and desperate men.<br />

Why would we be? It's not as if they remove cool transmogs or anything.<br />
<br />
The ring is merely an invisible stat buff that won't work at level 110 anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am, but everything that had to be said about this was said back in MoP when they did exactly the same thing... and well... they didn't change a thing and are still doing the same crap again. <br />
<br />
It was a bad move back then and is a bad move now. It's never a good idea to remove content. Trying to justify this as a way to reward players who played during the expansion it's simply stupid. We already have plenty of rewarding stuff that comes from that legendary questline that only has relevance now, including the ring itself. <br />
<br />
Why deny the chance to future players to enjoy the lore and have a bit of fun while they get some irrelevant rewards completing an old questline? Personally i had a blast playing through the scepter of the shifting sands questline when i was lvl80, just as many of us did while enjoying parts of the game that we didn't get to experience because we started playing later.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is dumb. A game and genre that is shrinking and they remove things/timesinks people can do by themselves or with friends on off nights. Surely the primary &quot;reward&quot; for players who played during the expansion is the fact they got to experience it with the majority of the playerbase when it was current?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think its dumb, just as I thought it was dumb back when they removed the cape questline.<br />
<br />
I don't care if they remove the ring itself, but they should have kept the chain itself, just remove ring reward and grinding for components out of it. its just so damn sad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For those of you who don't know, Weisman created and wrote most of Gargoyles, probably the richest, most well-written cartoon of the 90s. This is going to be a lot more than 'some kids book' if he's at the helm.</div></div><hr />

Shall we put pants on a deer? I see no boobs, plus when I was little I had a poster of fairies, some of them were topless young girls (too young for breasts but with flowery coverage, similar to this) all modeled after flowers with little wings. Like a cherub. Just because it's a girl wit no top on doesn't mean it's sexual. <br />
<br />
All the pervs nowdays see sex everywhere, and the people that think there's sex involved are just as bad. <br />
<br />
I think it's really pretty, plus you know, she's not real either. And...with a little deer body...<br />
<br />
People just need to CTFO. It's like Blaziken in Pokken Tournement and all these mothers think he has a penis showing, when all it is is chicken fluff by the crotch which it's always had, even the females..people will complain about anything :P</div></div><hr />

Why do angry neckbeards keep posting complaints about Ghostcrawler when it's obvious MMO-C is perfectly fine posting his comments?<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
I am, but everything that had to be said about this was said back in MoP when they did exactly the same thing... and well... they didn't change a thing and are still doing the same crap again. <br />
<br />
It was a bad move back then and is a bad move now. It's never a good idea to remove content. Trying to justify this as a way to reward players who played during the expansion it's simply stupid. We already have plenty of rewarding stuff that comes from that legendary questline that only has relevance now, including the ring itself. <br />
<br />
Why deny the chance to future players to enjoy the lore and have a bit of fun while they get some irrelevant rewards completing an old questline? Personally i had a blast playing through the scepter of the shifting sands questline when i was lvl80, just as many of us did while enjoying parts of the game that we didn't get to experience because we started playing later.<br />
<br />
This is why I was disappointed they removed the cloak quest arc in MoP - it's a compelling part of the story, and and important one, and it guts the story line. The same for WOD. <br />
<br />
But they've always been like that, once an expansion is done, they walk away from it and don't seem to care about the player's experience, unless it's the current game. The entire ride, from level one starting zone through all the expansions is a hell of a ride - and complete, until you get to MoP. So at least they can learn the lore and story that way, until MOP. <br />
<br />
Players have more reverence and respect for previous content than the devs do, which has always been kind of disappointing to me.<br />
<br />

I wonder what the response would be if someone said I want to feel like *everyone* and be strong and heroic in our community. The last thing I want is to be made to feel uncomfortable, under-appreciated or misrepresented by the quest lines being removed when Legion hits....</div></div><hr />

The ring is merely an invisible stat buff that won't work at level 110 anyway.<br />

Wasn't the ring supposed to make the players hand glimmer or have some cosmetic effect? Eh whatever, just another things removed from the filler expansion.</div></div><hr />

You're the one who's building strawman arguments about something you wish so very hard that I'd said, but didn't. I never said that anything about everyone having to conform to my standards - you said that. I never said anything about &quot;sexy characters are unable to kill other people&quot; - you said that. I never said I was campaigning to have anything changed with the game - you assumed that.<br />
<br />
The only thing I did, was explain to someone why the butt pose is viewed as &quot;too much&quot;, per his own verbiage.<br />
<br />
Also, look up the definition of what an internet troll is. Fits you rather perfectly.<br />
<br />
<br />
In Internet slang, a troll (/ˈtroʊl/, /ˈtrɒl/) is a person who sows discord on the Internet by starting arguments or upsetting people, by posting inflammatory, [1] extraneous, or off-topic messages in an online community (such as a newsgroup, forum, chat room, or blog) with the deliberate intent of provoking readers into an emotional response [2] or of otherwise disrupting normal on-topic discussion, [3] often for their own amusement.<br />

<br />
It's &quot;too much&quot; because there's absolutely no reason to sexualize a character that's in a game about killing people aside from tingling the nethers of teenaged boys and desperate men.<br />
<br />
Give us a shot of Winston's bulging crotch if Overwatch is really just about T&amp;A, otherwise it has no place in the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If there's no need to sexualize characters in fighting / killing games then characters like Widowmaker wouldn't exist, hell even Tracers skin tight pants wouldn't exist</div></div><hr />

And you'll continue to wait, since your whole supposition of &quot;being sexy but unable to kill things&quot; is entirely of your own manufacture and has precisely zero associative relevance to anything I've said or claimed. In this particular instance you alone are capable of answering your question.</div></div><hr />
