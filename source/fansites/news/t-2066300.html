We have a sort of a running joke in our guild. Whenever someone asks why something works this way and not another we reply &quot;Because Blizzard don't want you to have fun and enjoy yourself in the game!&quot; This very clearly applies to this toy nerf.</div></div><hr />

Tearing up the charts doesn't necessarily mean it's fun game play. Or fluid game play. It's not about the numbers. Yeah you can do big numbers, but if it isn't fun doing so, what's the point?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ElDoorO</div><div class="date">2016-09-09, 07:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ion went to the Warlock forums on many occasions to read about what Warlocks are upset about, but 95% of the posts aren't constructive feedback and makes it harder to figure out what is the issue. There is also lots of conflicting feedback, where people are unhappy for different and conflicting reasons.<br />
<br />
Even if it's not constructive -- they failed. When you have an unusually high amount of complaints you acknowledge it to them. They took the &quot;let's wait and see&quot; and it blew up in their face. <br />
<br />
<br />
The team appreciates the Warlock feedback and understands that people are unhappy, but it isn't constructive to communicate this through spamming up threads or starting petitions.<br />
<br />
Cry me a river and I'll swim in your tears. If that many people are unhappy -- you fucked up. Not even the Ret community is this bad. You had plenty of time in the pre-patch to address these things and failed. You have earned their ire.<br />
<br />
People are giving you a chance to fix the fuck up that was WoD and, for some, you're letting them down - and they are being vocal about it. If you require people be constructive then you need a new team to figure out what's going on because the current one isn't worth their salary.<br />
<br />
I've been in those shoes and one of the quickest things you do is to publicly acknowledge the issue and inform people that you're looking into it. Not just &quot;we're looking into warlock problems&quot; -- more like &quot;we're looking into affliction due to... and destro due to.. and demo due to ramp up slowness&quot; or whatever. You also announce progress so people don't feel forgotten.<br />
<br />
The current forum is complete shit and designed by fools. The bug system, for instance, is piss poor at communicating something has been acknowledged leading to many &quot;me too&quot; or additional spammy post. The class forum is a single-thread post echo chamber for circle jerking. This doesn't mean forums aren't bad -- it just means that everything in there shouldn't be a simple 1990's forum. Let's use a well known bug: Monk roll and fsk.<br />
<br />
It's not in the &quot;known bugs&quot; list. Why? I'm sure there's tons other but all this does is breed more spammy threads and shit communication.<br />
<br />
I hope this doesn't turn into another WoD-like failure and they give up next patch in favor of the next expansion 2 years later.<br />
<br />
tl;dr: It sounds like Ion and his team wants a one-way street with communication.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The main complaints with warlocks are not number based for the most part other than the randomness of destro mastery. The problems are mechanical as in the rotations of all 3 specs feel clunky, slow, and unrewarding, especially demonology.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is certainly possible. Let's examine this though.<br />
<br />
You have an unusually high amount of people complaining -- an amount not normal consistent with something being wrong. Something. We don't know what. It could be a bug, it could be stats, it could be gear, it could be the player sucks, it could be anything.<br />
<br />
You mentioned two parts: Undergeared and underskilled. Let's ignore the other possibilities and talk about these two.<br />
<br />
How is one supposed to know if they are undergeared? What mechanism in the game tells you &quot;hey, you really have a shit trinket and that weapon isn't progressed very far and those relics, buddy, are shit -- this is going to suck to be you&quot; -- there isn't one. That's not cool. Should a warlock need to be 840 when my havoc DH needs to be 830? How can a player know it's their gear?<br />
<br />
Underskilled: How does a player know they aren't playing right? Let's use demo as an example. Without going to Icy Veins, Noxxic, or any other third party website beyond Blizzard's forums and the game itself -- how do you know what you're supposed to do?<br />
<br />
Yes, I know Noxxic is shit -- but too many people don't know that and Blizzard doesn't endorse any of them. So how will Jim Bob know he should use IV instead of Noxxic? Or even be aware IV exists at all? Or even Noxxic?<br />
<br />
None of those tell you about interrupts either. My Vengeance DH has three methods of silencing folks plus one AoE fear. How many DH's think to use the belf ability or Sigil of Misery to buy their healer some time? I say all this to really mean: The WoW dev team is complete and utter shit and explaining to players how they are supposed to play their character &quot;properly&quot;. For players just coming back and giving WoW another shot -- that's kind of a big deal.<br />
<br />
Why is it so hard for Blizzard to articulate how a class is supposed to be played?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binko</div><div class="date">2016-09-09, 07:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What an smug and self-serving ass this guy is. He says that people were unhappy for different and conflicting reasons so he just couldn't figure out the problems and therefore they did nothing. What a crock. If a huge swath of the community is unhappy for a bunch of different reasons then you have a big problem you have to start working to solve, starting with some back and forth communication. This guy should never be allowed to communicate with the press or public.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">elvor0</div><div class="date">2016-09-09, 07:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I asked the guy how he was liking it so far and he said it was fun.

That's just one person though. There's also a few people that like new ret, but the general consensus(shared by myself) is that it's spammy, unrewarding and too simplistic.</div></div><hr />

This feedback on the glacial pace of Nightfallen rep was given to Ion in beta and he stubbornly trudged ahead with it. His comments here clearly show that he doesn't even play the game he helps create at this point.<br />
<br />
The amount of time you spend actually doing the Suramar storyline pales in comparison to the amount of time you spend waiting on World Quests to pop, or praying you get that extra Withered Army training so you can push that bar forward just a bit more. I very much doubt most players are even going to bother going further than Revered once raids are out, and the casuals aren't even going to bother with that since they'll have LFR as a gear source. I'd venture to say the majority of the playerbase as it is, is never going to run either dungeon or finish that questline.<br />
<br />

I don't mind it too much really. It really isn't too bad if you think about it. I unlocked it the other day, a little over a week after launch, and I didn't do anything special. I just did the world quests in Suramar when they popped up, and the scenario when it showed up every few days (which I messed up pretty hard once).<br />
<br />
People are just making the grind look harder than it actually is.</div></div><hr />

I agree 100%. It was bad enough they had to throw CRZ into the older zones, making it hard to get anything done rarewise, but now they're going to try to force CRZ on us in the new content? It's bullshit. It also makes the Hungering questline so much harder, orb 6 is near impossible right now, between the people griefing it. I'm interested in seeing what they do with the multitap orb, if it'll have a period of time where everyone can use it, but the easiest fix would be to just disable CRZ in that area.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Got 15 alts (lvl 100), leveled 3 to 110 then the quests became boring, geared 2 of those to around ilvl 825, then on both (dps classes) hit a brick wall doing HC's, not kidding did 10 HC's in a row, 1 single item dropped which had the worst possible stats, and was a lower ilvl item than what i had, there is just zero nada zilch bad luck protection it seems. (No i dont expect gear to be thrown everywhere, but i do expect at least something useful to drop in 10 HC's), and at the same time seeing guildmembers getting drops non stop, most of them being warforged etc, just killed any my mood completely.<br />
<br />
Both guildmembers and PUGs are demanding 835-840 ilvl to get in to mythics, so that's not viable.<br />
<br />
Add on top of that, that every clear of the new dungs are taking significantly longer than in wod (30-45min on my server), and the fact that i don't really enjoy any of the new dungeons at all, it's just not fun anymore, so can't really see myself ever doing them again on whatever difficulty.<br />
<br />
Yeah there is WQ which are dropping current ilvl-5 for all of them, so you need even more luck getting it to proc warforged, and yeah there is the class hall pieces with sub optimal stats on 3/4 pieces.<br />
<br />
Will probably get back when the raids release, hopefully they will be better, as the loot progression at least is somewhat determistic (as in stuff _will_ drop).</div></div><hr />

I'm halfway through Honored with all the reps at this point, and it's been 10 days. I'd say that's pretty decent pacing. And I'm not even doing all the world quests, just the ones I feel like. Most of my time is spent in Suramar because it's a fun zone.</div></div><hr />

Maybe if you don't like traversing the environment the way it was intended to be you should play a different game. F-ing flying has spoiled everyone to no end. I like having to find trails and getting stuck and backtracking adds to the feel of exploration.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have an unusually high amount of people complaining -- an amount not normal consistent with something being wrong. Something. We don't know what. It could be a bug, it could be stats, it could be gear, it could be the player sucks, it could be anything.<br />
<br />
You mentioned two parts: Undergeared and underskilled. Let's ignore the other possibilities and talk about these two.<br />
<br />
How is one supposed to know if they are undergeared? What mechanism in the game tells you &quot;hey, you really have a shit trinket and that weapon isn't progressed very far and those relics, buddy, are shit -- this is going to suck to be you&quot; -- there isn't one. That's not cool. Should a warlock need to be 840 when my havoc DH needs to be 830? How can a player know it's their gear?<br />
<br />
Underskilled: How does a player know they aren't playing right? Let's use demo as an example. Without going to Icy Veins, Noxxic, or any other third party website beyond Blizzard's forums and the game itself -- how do you know what you're supposed to do?<br />
<br />
Yes, I know Noxxic is shit -- but too many people don't know that and Blizzard doesn't endorse any of them. So how will Jim Bob know he should use IV instead of Noxxic? Or even be aware IV exists at all? Or even Noxxic?<br />
<br />
None of those tell you about interrupts either. My Vengeance DH has three methods of silencing folks plus one AoE fear. How many DH's think to use the belf ability or Sigil of Misery to buy their healer some time? I say all this to really mean: The WoW dev team is complete and utter shit and explaining to players how they are supposed to play their character &quot;properly&quot;. For players just coming back and giving WoW another shot -- that's kind of a big deal.<br />
<br />
Why is it so hard for Blizzard to articulate how a class is supposed to be played?<br />
<br />
<br />
Because there isn't one way a class is &quot;suppose&quot; to be played. The right way according to everyone here is just what does &quot;max dps&quot; and that only matters to people who raid which is the minority of players. The average player only cares about if stuff dies while they are questing that's it. If hitting one button over and over kills it they will do that.</div></div><hr />

They haven't &quot;done&quot; anything for warlocks.<br />
<br />
Just to be clear, most of the issues with warlocks are about the way the specs feel to play compared to previous implementations, not necessarily balance or tuning.<br />
<br />
The biggest offenders are things like removing mobility, adding a cast time and shard cost to Rain of Fire, and removing unique resource mechanics like Burning Embers and Chaotic Energy in favor of Soul Shards and Life Tap, which has caused the class to feel more clunky and less rewarding, while also removing unique class fantasy for each of the specs.<br />
<br />
Other big issues are the ramp up times for the specs and the general clunkiness and whack-a-mole feeling of Demonology, which makes you feel very weak and useless outside of single target situations.<br />
<br />
And, as a minor side note, the pet AI was significantly dumbed down in 7.0, as well, which also affects the class's fun factor.<br />
<br />
<br />
All of this coupled with the fact that the class has really only been nerfed for the last two expansions (lots removed, very little added), and rarely gets attention in hot fixes or patch notes, has contributed to the overall discontent of warlock players.</div></div><hr />

There is a whistle on a five-minute cooldown that takes you to the nearest flight path, a 20-minute hearth to Dalaran (HS used to be 60m originally, IIRC) and you can buy goblin glider kits or make them if you have the profession. Also some classes have ports to their CH.<br />
<br />
Reputation gains are the easiest they've ever been in this game; no idea why people are complaining about that, either. Why do you think it's okay to blow through all the game's content in a week? Is it so you can get back to complaining about lack of content?<br />
<br />
And if you don't like certain things about a class, say what they are and why and how they affect you rather than just whining about X class being broken or getting &quot;rekt&quot; and not being specific. People can't help you or make the game better if you aren't specific about your criticisms. To say, &quot;Well, obviously there's a problem, so fix it,&quot; or, &quot;Obviously, Xs are broken,&quot; doesn't do anything for anyone AND doesn't get you what you want, a fixed class.

I enjoyed my demo warlock doing LFR and invasion stuff but The ramp up time issue is a noticeable problem when they are soloing. It takes a pretty large number of casts to get your basic level of dogs+Imps out and empowered for solo PVE leveling where you are constantly having to start back at square one or just feel unimpressive.<br />
<br />
Starting at 3 shards is probably a good option it either gives you one cast for a full hand of gul'dan cast or lets you get your dogs out and if you take the improved one that gives you two dogs and two imps for 2 shards open with that and then empower gets you going pretty well right off the bat and really does not do much that would long term over power them.</div></div><hr />

The problem though is the kite made it through and out of beta.

Mixed signals are frustrating as was the nature of the nerf itself; going from a 3m to a 15m CD was way too knee-jerky and really removes the choice in using it in the first place.

They seem fine to me.<br />
You're looking at Demo based solely on its output, and not what the player is doing to produce that output.<br />
<br />
Demo excels at patchwork-style fights (single target, longish to even out the ramp-up time, and little movement required to accommodate a spell arsenal that's overflowing with cast times) because its a very &quot;spammy&quot; style of play that promotes tunnel vision. While that may produce good results on certain encounters, its not a particularly fun or engaging spec even on the encounters where its strongest. The complaints about Demo's output have more to do with its sub-par AoE and cleave.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem isn't persay the actual reputation gain for Nightfallen (the other reps are fine BTW).<br />
<br />
The problem is that 20% of this game's dungeon content, at launch, is gated behind a rep to a point where it takes 10 days for most characters, at a *minimum* to unlock. That's doing every possible WQ, leyline, getting top score in WA training (which isn't possible flat out for some class/spec combos) and grinding through the story.<br />
<br />
Sure, that's fine for one character. Now imagine doing that atrocious escort quest with the little Nightborne girl on your fifth alt. <br />
<br />
The fact is, some people enjoy questing. Some people enjoy dailies. Some people enjoy running mythic dungeons. Some people enjoy all of it. The problem lies when the group that only enjoys doing the one thing is forced to do the other things for days at a time, consecutively. That's shitty design that shouldn't be in the game anymore.</div></div><hr />

I think either you misunderstood what I was applying the mixed signal to, or I could have phrased it better; I'm talking about the nature of the change. Going from 3m to 15m clearly sends a &quot;we don't want you to use this&quot; message, but there's a little bit of effort in gathering all four pieces so you'd think that it was meant to be used.<br />

I honestly think class design should be decoupled at this point from the expansion/patch schedule, and just worked on by a team all the time. &quot;Balance&quot; the way they work now is a total unicorn. They spent a long time on classes in Legion, and I think it's showing it was just too much to handle in that time period. Classes should evolve when ready, not by artifcial gates like an expansion or patch. Yet again, there was a massive mountain of feedback from players, and yet again, the devs are unsure what to do. I don't know what the problem is. Is it how they work internally? Is their &quot;design by committee&quot; method keeping them back? <br />
<br />
I understand what they were attempting with this revamp - it's like classes were a painting, and by the end of WOD that painting was so overpainted and changed so often it was muddy and unsalvageable, so this time they scraped the paint off and started over. But they had too many paintings to do, in too short a time. And they seem to be very reluctant to go too far, they're being very minimalist now. <br />
<br />
Or, they should just throw their hands up in the air, say &quot;Look, classes are hard. There will never be &quot;balance&quot;. Abilities will change when we change them. Just go play the damn game.&quot; and be done with the hand wringing and over-thinking of it all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nighthold is supposed to release early in 2017. It's part of the 7.0.3 content, it just isn't unlocked yet, similar to Blackrock Foundry in WoD (except hopefully handled better). If they are sticking to the Mists content release as a guideline, then I suspect that the 7.2 content will be something that adds to the story, but potentially in a way we were both expecting and not expecting- similar to Throne of Thunder or Ulduar. Meaning, not necessarily Legion-centric (although this could be filled by the Stormheim miniraid in 7.1, who knows).</div></div><hr />

<br />
short time? You mean YEARS?<br />
<br />
and why should they abandon class balance when they literally fixed it with PvE and PvP division? Its not that its hard, there are companies out there with far more complex stuff to balance out and do it just fine by fine-tuning regularly. Its blizzards own decision not to fine-tune, they are used to &quot;good-ol-days&quot; when any change made huge impact on everything so they invented extremely rare but also extremely powerful nerfhammer. They just forgot that times change. They always did it in WoW and they keep doing that in hearthstone as well. One problematic card? Okay, wait about 6-12 months and then nerf it to the ground, making it totally unplayable.<br />
<br />
As they did in WoD, nerfed demo locks to the ground and openly said &quot;Fuck off, we dont want you to play demo only.&quot; Is that fine? At that time yeah, now when they can tune PvE and PvP separately? Hell no. When shit is standardized in PvP I see no reason to wait with PvP template fixes and there are huge problems (from tanks being useless in BGs to healers dying in seconds to stunlocks', this is rly not going to change with better gear or whatever. Also if a certain spec just sucks balls in dungeons and nobody wants to take it its unlikely that will change on its own as well</div></div><hr />

The right way according to everyone here is just what does &quot;max dps&quot; and that only matters to people who raid which is the minority of players. The average player only cares about if stuff dies while they are questing that's it. If hitting one button over and over kills it they will do that.<br />
<br />
I'm doing to have to disagree with you. Brewmasters are an excellent example of a very binary way to play. You are either super squishy or somewhat competitive. Brewmasters aren't an in ideal place right now but I think they get the point across. Demo warlocks -- if you aren't buffing your pets every time then you are missing out on dps (which is kind of the point of being a dps, yes?).<br />
<br />
If you use Essence Font as a monk as your primary heal -- you're Going To Have A Bad Time (TM).<br />
<br />
If you don't use Fel Rush and Vengeful retreat as a DH simply because you don't those -- you're not going to be competitive.<br />
<br />
So yes, there absolutely is a way a class is supposed to be played -- and in some cases the basics aren't intuitive and in fewer cases the ideal way is not intuitive.<br />
<br />
I had all 13 classes at max level before Legion hit. I play on having all 13 before Legion is over, most likely.<br />
<br />
I can assure you -- every class and spec has a way it's &quot;supposed&quot; to be played.<br />
<br />
What study are you using to cite what the &quot;average&quot; person is? I'd also guess what in your undefined &quot;average&quot; -- that same person probably would like to not spend 10 minutes on a mob when it cam be killed in one. They'll get frustrated rather quickly.<br />
<br />
My guess is most people will grep over the talents quickly and pick what feels like the &quot;right&quot; choice or what's easier. Sometimes the &quot;right&quot; choice is hard to know because they aren't going to sit down and do the math.<br />
<br />
But, ok, I'll give you an inch. Let's assume the &quot;average&quot; (whatever your undefined meaning is) player just wants to quest and win through questing. The devs are doing them a disservice by not making things intuitive --or-- not showing them how it's ideally supposed to be done. <br />
<br />
Further, if that person is in a dungeon and decides to try their hand at tanking -- the difference between, say, Brewmaster and Vengeance is huge.</div></div><hr />

Then the people talking about pacing and burnout when there's someone who already has 3 level 110s geared up to 825 and the expansion hasn't even been out for two weeks yet! Some of you should really just stop playing the game, it's obvious you don't enjoy it anymore. Half of the time I think people are just making shit up to justify their complaints... saying nobody will take certain classes or people sub 835 ilvl when I started pugging mythics at 824 ilvl. <br />
<br />
I haven't enjoyed this game as much as I am right now since Wrath, and Legion so far is shaping up to be better than that even. I'm loving these Q&amp;A's too, Ion seems like a really cool dude and it's clear he cares about the game. Almost everything that was discussed in the Q&amp;A is from topics I've seen on this very forum.

that because of 1 reason - mythic crybabies - if it wasnt for that crowd we would have mythic + dungeons already on launch , rep vendors would have gear equal to hc raiding just like they did in past , world bosses would be out , proffesions wouldnt be pointless - but because of mythic crybabies eveyrthing has some artificial cellign of 850 itlv for 3 weeks for no reason whatsoever <br />

We have had a 25 quests cap for what, over 11 years now? They have added thousands upon thousands of quests since then and there are plenty of quests that can not be done in a single day, so you are stuck with a bunch of quests that fill up the Quest Log. That in turn makes it hard to justify having such a low cap. <br />
<br />
Seriously, they could easily double the cap to 50, and it would not affect the effectiveness of the Quest Log in a negative way. This is not 2004 where you had to read the quest text to keep track on where you needed to go. You have markers on your map that track the locations of all your quests fairly accurately, which makes keeping a check on your Quest Log very, very easy. The 25 quests cap make little sense with the way the game is currently designed and only poses an annoyance when trying to deal with more than one daily quest hub, especially when you are trying to do old and new content.</div></div><hr />

You could forgive the playerbase thinking &quot;Blizzard must be okay with this then&quot; and incorporating it into their play, only to then log in a few days later and see that the CD was gutted. Mixed signals are frustrating as was the nature of the nerf itself; going from a 3m to a 15m CD was way too knee-jerky and really removes the choice in using it in the first place. A 5m CD would have been far more reasonable -or- make the kite into Aviana's Feather 2.0 and keep the 15m CD.<br />
<br />
Oh I don't agree with the amount they nerfed it but I agree with the nerf itself, I mean they could make it 5 minutes that seems more reasonable and then reduce the CD on the Goblin Glider to 2 mins.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redecle</div><div class="date">2016-09-10, 01:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hopefully the tier set comment is not restricting the fact that the team thinks<br />
Emerald Nightmare is tier 1, when it's tier 0,5, cause the actual tier items are in Nighthold.<br />
Tomb of Sargeras is kind of given thing to be the final raid, doof.. <br />
Currently the whole Broken Shore just screams final patch progressive daily quest area, much like Isle of Quel'danas. Full of way too powerful demon bosses and elites, no current quests.<br />
But is that going to be tier 2 in Legion?<br />
And 7.1 is supposed to come before Nighthold is opened, that's what was said earlier. Cause the Trial of Valor was to serve as a small mid raid in between EM and Nighthold.<br />
So if EM is tier 0, Trial of Valor is 0,5, Nighthold is tier 1, hopefully Tomb of Sargeras is at least tier 3.<br />
And if the Ulduar and Throne of Thunder model is continued, which i do believe it is as mid expansion raid tier.<br />
Which this time is not legion centric and going to another scenery. <br />
My guess looking at certain zone, certain villain in this expansion making appearance, the fact that Emerald Nightmare has been known to possibly have some links, the location of the Isles and the amount of underwater mounts being handed out all combined. It doesn't take a genius to figure out where this is all going and what is a change from all the demons. We are going to Ny'alotha in tier 2 for Queen Azshara and N'zoth. We are in the middle of the ocean already and some maps (there are variations) show that the sunken city is not that far off from the Tomb. Who knows there might already be something in the surrounding ocean floor in the current map, it's not like a lot of people have probably gone diving around the sea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and why should they abandon class balance when they literally fixed it with PvE and PvP division? Its not that its hard, there are companies out there with far more complex stuff to balance out and do it just fine by fine-tuning regularly. Its blizzards own decision not to fine-tune, they are used to &quot;good-ol-days&quot; when any change made huge impact on everything so they invented extremely rare but also extremely powerful nerfhammer. They just forgot that times change. They always did it in WoW and they keep doing that in hearthstone as well. One problematic card? Okay, wait about 6-12 months and then nerf it to the ground, making it totally unplayable.<br />
<br />
As they did in WoD, nerfed demo locks to the ground and openly said &quot;Fuck off, we dont want you to play demo only.&quot; Is that fine? At that time yeah, now when they can tune PvE and PvP separately? Hell no. When shit is standardized in PvP I see no reason to wait with PvP template fixes and there are huge problems (from tanks being useless in BGs to healers dying in seconds to stunlocks', this is rly not going to change with better gear or whatever. Also if a certain spec just sucks balls in dungeons and nobody wants to take it its unlikely that will change on its own as well<br />
<br />
Why should they abandon balance? Because they've never been in balance, and never will be. And, the entire WoW community spends an inordinate amount of time wringing their hands about it, and ranting, like you just did. In fact, you proved part of my point, thanks.

1st of all, it is not just about DPS output, but how spec feels like. Now I cant say, that any of specs is nejoyable.<br />

what rant? are you blind? Balance does not mean 0 difference, 5-10% is doable no problem, the problem is there are 20-30% differences and the reason, as you wrote, they never adressed that, was it would create problems either in PvP or PvE, which is no longer the case.

All DPS specs are pure DPS - especially now. Mages, rogues etc should not automatically be better than Druids, Paladins etc.<br />
<br />
A monk only has one DPS spec and so do pallies. They shouldn't be gimped just because you think &quot;pures&quot; should be better. The hybrid tax never really existed and hasn't for a long time.</div></div><hr />

When the only DPS spec available to monks was WWer. It's not like shaman where they can go enhancement if they wanted to. There was only one choice and right after MOP it was destroyed and left many people stuck having to reroll because no one wanted to play it because of these changes. This was a character that was brand new to the game and it was a failure for 2 years. Still goes on to state that casters were always top and melee fell somewhere in between mages, warlocks and moonkin and their shittiest version of those classes. At least it was acknowledged that your class is boned. I know many hunters who hate how their class plays but they play it. Ride out the storm like most other classes have... but classes that are used to being good don't know how to handle not being good for a little while.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So from your POV is smaller problem that PURE DPS class sux overall in doing damage, than HYBRID class sux in doing damage, when it have still two other specs which if I remember correctly were very good at least in WoD. Also melee sucked? Melee were very often top DPS classes, combats are now splitted into anti-melee abilities and anti-caster abilities so movement necessary is very similar for both of them. DK, Paladin also Warriors were very good DPS last few datadiscs (again I cant say same about another pure DPS - Rogue). Hunters are very good for long time, how I know it? Well... most of guilds had like 2-3 hunters in raid, same with mages (they were literally good in every situation and enjoyable to play). I cant tell same about locks for example. Plenty of guilds had none or one.</div></div><hr />

It really isn't too bad if you think about it. I unlocked it the other day, a little over a week after launch, and I didn't do anything special. I just did the world quests in Suramar when they popped up, and the scenario when it showed up every few days (which I messed up pretty hard once).<br />
<br />
People are just making the grind look harder than it actually is.<br />
<br />
Agreed in that I'm finding the grind isn't overly bad, though I can see why people might feel disheartened at first. It's kinda a letdown when you do your first few world quests and only end up getting 50-100 rep per quest. I wish they'd added more ways to influence your reputation such as gaining some small amount of rep points from giving mana to afflicted citizens in the city. Small things that you can busy yourself with between world quests to make it go a little faster like they did with the Netherwing. God knows I'm perpetually capped on mana anyways so I could use a damn sink.<br />
<br />
Maybe that's already a thing and I've just missed it but, alas, I've found not much.<br />
<br />
So far I think the biggest gripe I have is that reputations seem like a lot of work for very little gain right now. WoD had a lot of faults but at least the reputations gave transmog gear, mounts and titles where as in Legion the only thing you can really expect to get at Exalted is a lousy tabard. I'll probably get the Nightfallen to revered and that's about it. Tabards are nice but the time investment just isn't worth the end payment of a relatively meaningless transmog piece that can only be used on that one character anyways.</div></div><hr />

Why not just portals taking you from spot A to spot B? Surely that's about as immersive?<br />
<br />
Flight at some point or other renders content (yes, getting intercepted by mobs is content - encounters are the very definition of content, lack of encounters is what made WOD so...memorable...) irrelevant thus it might as well not be there. This is fine if you have some means to ensure that all experience this content (which you put in place because you believed it would make the game better overall) before finally taking to the skies to skip it, if so desired.<br />
<br />
If you put in place the means to skip from the get-go then you might as well not bother having any ground content, and rather dispense with those resources and instead just provide portals from starting point to where the quest should take place.<br />
<br />
I went ahead and got Pathfinder in WoD myself and I will certainly do the same in Legion, I believe flight is a good thing. But I also think it's good to keep it restricted both insofar as waiting with releasing it as well as making it take some effort before it's unlocked, precisely because you otherwise dispense with the need to create any story lines or living environments in the world, removing the whole point of world content.<br />
<br />
Now, if you could somehow make the air considerably more hazardous and make a realistic call where flight is viable but in some cases may be slower or more hazardous than ground travel then having flight from the start could work out just fine, but I suspect this is something they'd struggle to deliver, or it'd be in the game already.<br />

Have they even tried to play an affliction warlock in a dungeon while leveling? You're literally the definition of the third wheel.

<br />
First of all, let me thank you for being more civil than other people who responded to my remarks.<br />
<br />
Immersion is a subjective thing. I find myself more immersed in the world when I can fly above it, appreciate the landscapes and the views from the air. It gives me a better perspective and is more enjoyable. You can't just tell someone &quot;But you need to use a ground mount, it's more immersive for you!&quot; However, it increasingly feels like Blizzard are deciding for their player what they will enjoy.<br />
<br />
I may be a little more jaded than you are, because I see being knocked off my mount as a deliberate nuisance, an inconvenience, a way to stretch the time played to the maximum by making things take longer to do than necessary. I would experience this &quot;content&quot; all the same, because I like to do all quests in all zones, so I'd get to kill those enemies all the same, but it would happen when I decided to do it, not when the game forces me to. Especially in Legion when the zones are so crammed with mobs that stopping to pick a herb forces me to decrease the local moose population by half (yes, I am exaggerating on purpose, but it sure feels like you can't blow your nose in Legion without aggroing a bunch of enemies).</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't like raiding, ergo &quot;who cares if it doesn't work properly and isn't fun for the people who go in there? I don't like raiders, so they shouldn't have fun!&quot; Flawless logic there mate. Absolutely flawless. Two wrongs don't make a right. Look, raiding has been the major path of progression since Vanilla, it has not been &quot;destroying the game for years now&quot;. If it had, it never would've reached the 12m sub count that it did in the early days of Wrath, quite some time before the game ever became more approachable and friendly to the non-raider. It's just a boogyman bitter, unthinking players roll out to use as a scapegoat. It's why a bunch of the player base blamed Raiders for WoD when it was actually the damn garrison depriving everyone of stuff to do, casual and hardcore alike. <br />
<br />
I am quite, quite happy to have alternative progression paths for the non raider, in fact Mythic + is a really cool addition as far as I'm concerned, it lets the more casual player seek a challenge without the large team or massive amount of time invested if they dislike that or don't have the time, and rewards them for it, it keeps 5 mans relevant and gives a new progression path for people. I fully intend to jump in there just for the fun factor. And if you truly intend to go through the mythic + progression path, then you need to...go through the progression path. Which means gearing up in mythic plus, not outgearing it before you go in there, you just need to be patient, it's not like raiders are all running around getting the best gear right now either.<br />
<br />
But you need to step back and realize there's a reason you aren't calling the shots here and why things aren't the way you want them to be. You just see short term, blinded by bitter jealousy. You want gear NOW. &quot;I WANT MY EPIC GEAR NOW&quot; you cry, without considering what effect that would have on game balance. You just want it NOW. Gimme, gimme, gimme! And all you can muster up in response to your short sightedness is &quot;who cares if it breaks balance?&quot; &quot;I'd get mine, who cares about anyone who isn't me?&quot;<br />
<br />
I would presume you'd shit bricks if a bunch of raiders said &quot;who cares&quot; to your complaints, right? Oh but they're raiders, so it's okay to belittle their issues because they're the enemy, a bunch of scheming individuals who constantly try to keep those damn casuals down! Again, a scapegoat so that you can just wheel out as an excuse to not even think about the implication of your suggestion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mind boggling crazy comments on balance though. Seriously, WoW balance team has a memory of a gold fish. For 1, they were still balancing up until less than a week before launch, begs the question, did they finish or did they run out of time. Second, they said they were going to continuously actively balance, here they are pretty much saying they wont. They were meant to have the tools to &quot;tweek&quot; skills and specs as required, yet here they say they just want to to major patch changes. <br />
<br />
Lastly, they say they don't want to fix things till AFTER the content that people want shit fixed by is released &gt;.&lt; WTF In the past they have also said, they want to make as little changes as possible during raid tiers as to not throw guild progression and tactics out of whack. <br />
<br />
So with all these factors counter in, we are probably not going to see a balance update until 7.1 in mid November to late.<br />

But maybe I should be more specific, I meant BM hunters losing all the fun aspects of what was it tobe a hunter such as traps etc. The rotation is boring as hell, I don't want to play with tons of dire beasts, I would rather play with Dire Frenzy but it's so poor, it's not possible, pet AI is all but non existent (I don't mean the change to assist, that just takes a bit of getting use to), you almost have to use a turtle or some pet with a tank CD to take on more than 2 or 3 mobs.<br />
<br />
If you're happy with your hunter, then I'm happy for you, but all the negative feedback over the course of teh beta seemed to fall on deaf ears. I would just like a section that explains what their thinking was in the say way Warlocks just got</div></div><hr />

There is massive discontent in the Warlock community, and I assure you that it's more than the numbers. The rotation, especially for Demonology, is extremely awkward and clunky. A lot of what made a warlock a warlock was taken from the class and spread around (metamorphosis given to Demon Hunters, verdant spheres given to mages, etc.) while we got mechanics that other classes loathed (mages' Prismatic Crystal was dumped on warlocks in the form of Soul Effigy, maintenance buffs were deemed outdated but warlocks have to Lifetap or we quickly run out of mana, etc.). Dreadsteed/Felsteed mount animations are broken. And the list goes on.</div></div><hr />

You want to say, that having two golden traits that trigger on-kill is not a problem with mechanic? It had sense when aff artifact spawned killable souls and it is seen that artifact is balanced around that fact.

<br />
<br />
The champion limit allows the team to make you choose which missions you want to do. If the limit was increased, more missions would have to be offered and it would creep closer to the Garrison system where there are constant missions and it is a large feature.<br />
<br />
Then just don't offer more missions. The limit is frustrating. Yet another artificial min/max feature I have to go online to figure out what to keep. This is exactly one of the problems with Garrisons, I had to choose 25 from 299, now it's 5 from 8. Just give us all 8 champions and the same amount of missions.<br />
<br />
<br />
The concern with raising the limit is how it will become hard to keep track of all of the quests you have.<br />
<br />
That's not a concern at all. It's babysitting. How many quests you have doesn't change your ability to do them. If a new player is just picking up quests and not doing them, that is a completely different issue unrelated to the quest limit. There's not really anything you can do to save a player like that. A limit harms thousands more players just to help the handful of players that would do that. Just raise the limit. 50 should be fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those are not in the main story line as you need to go pick them up out in the world. The main story line is the quest lines that send you out from that place underground(forgot the name of the place).<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
The team originally wasn't sure players would figure it out, but the community worked together to figure it out!<br />
Yeah, the community of like 10-30 players or so. 99,9999999999999999999999etc% didn't know shit nor did they care.<br />
<br />
There are still tons of people out there farming Kosumoth hoping the mount is just going to drop.<br />
I joined a raid to kill it, saying the mount would drop for me 100% sure. It dropped, and I told people to follow if they wanted to see it. Only two people did, and they got to know how to get it instead of wasting time farming the fucking mob that won't drop it.<br />
<br />
<br />
The concern with raising the limit is how it will become hard to keep track of all of the quests you have.<br />
Only mentally challenged people will have a problem with this, and these type of things shouldn't be designed around their disabilities.<br />
It's easier to keep track of quests in your quest log rather than leaving them out in the world somewhere to pick up later.<br />

The Auction House UI is pretty unacceptable at this point and past due for a revamp.<br />

<br />
You don't like raiding, ergo &quot;who cares if it doesn't work properly and isn't fun for the people who go in there? I don't like raiders, so they shouldn't have fun!&quot; Flawless logic there mate. Absolutely flawless. Two wrongs don't make a right. Look, raiding has been the major path of progression since Vanilla, it has not been &quot;destroying the game for years now&quot;. If it had, it never would've reached the 12m sub count that it did in the early days of Wrath, quite some time before the game ever became more approachable and friendly to the non-raider. It's just a boogyman bitter, unthinking players roll out to use as a scapegoat. It's why a bunch of the player base blamed Raiders for WoD when it was actually the damn garrison depriving everyone of stuff to do, casual and hardcore alike. <br />
<br />
I am quite, quite happy to have alternative progression paths for the non raider, in fact Mythic + is a really cool addition as far as I'm concerned, it lets the more casual player seek a challenge without the large team or massive amount of time invested if they dislike that or don't have the time, and rewards them for it, it keeps 5 mans relevant and gives a new progression path for people. I fully intend to jump in there just for the fun factor. And if you truly intend to go through the mythic + progression path, then you need to...go through the progression path. Which means gearing up in mythic plus, not outgearing it before you go in there, you just need to be patient, it's not like raiders are all running around getting the best gear right now either.<br />
<br />
But you need to step back and realize there's a reason you aren't calling the shots here and why things aren't the way you want them to be. You just see short term, blinded by bitter jealousy. You want gear NOW. &quot;I WANT MY EPIC GEAR NOW&quot; you cry, without considering what effect that would have on game balance. You just want it NOW. Gimme, gimme, gimme! And all you can muster up in response to your short sightedness is &quot;who cares if it breaks balance?&quot; &quot;I'd get mine, who cares about anyone who isn't me?&quot;<br />
<br />
I would presume you'd shit bricks if a bunch of raiders said &quot;who cares&quot; to your complaints, right? Oh but they're raiders, so it's okay to belittle their issues because they're the enemy, a bunch of scheming individuals who constantly try to keep those damn casuals down! Again, a scapegoat so that you can just wheel out as an excuse to not even think about the implication of your suggestion.<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem is not raiding itself nor that raiders get stuff non-raiders won't get. I don't raid, and I think raiding should reward items non-raiders can't get.<br />
The problem is that this min/max bullshit and time/effort shit is spreading out and effecting all the other content in the game, which shouldn't be the case.<br />
Raiding and exclusive items to raiders is fine - players that only play for rewards and doing the most they can for the least effort and the least amount of time possible is not.</div></div><hr />

Because they refuse to communicate in the class forums so it takes a full blown outrage to get their attention. It's unfortunate it takes this but that's what it takes. I remember them doing the same thing with Brewmasters in WoD when they did the guard nerf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Got 15 alts (lvl 100), leveled 3 to 110 then the quests became boring, geared 2 of those to around ilvl 825, then on both (dps classes) hit a brick wall doing HC's, not kidding did 10 HC's in a row, 1 single item dropped which had the worst possible stats, and was a lower ilvl item than what i had, there is just zero nada zilch bad luck protection it seems. (No i dont expect gear to be thrown everywhere, but i do expect at least something useful to drop in 10 HC's), and at the same time seeing guildmembers getting drops non stop, most of them being warforged etc, just killed any my mood completely.<br />
<br />
Both guildmembers and PUGs are demanding 835-840 ilvl to get in to mythics, so that's not viable.<br />
<br />
Add on top of that, that every clear of the new dungs are taking significantly longer than in wod (30-45min on my server), and the fact that i don't really enjoy any of the new dungeons at all, it's just not fun anymore, so can't really see myself ever doing them again on whatever difficulty.<br />
<br />
Yeah there is WQ which are dropping current ilvl-5 for all of them, so you need even more luck getting it to proc warforged, and yeah there is the class hall pieces with sub optimal stats on 3/4 pieces.<br />
<br />
Will probably get back when the raids release, hopefully they will be better, as the loot progression at least is somewhat determistic (as in stuff _will_ drop).<br />
<br />
First off, sorry for the luck you've had but i guess it cant be helped :/. I just wanna address the pugs and guild ilvl requirments, most mythic pugs need 825-830 (which you are in range of) few need 820 and if you are anything above 840 you will probably be insta accepted, now pugs have always had stupid requirements because they aren't organised and have no comms or such, so better gear helps clear faster. Now about your guild needing 835-840, I can only advice you to leave a guild like that, the whole point of a guild is to help each other progress through content, anything above 805 is acceptable for a guild mythic run, mythics really aren't that hard when you are organised. This is of course assuming you asked to join given that you are lower ilvl and wasn't accepted. If you do sub back again tho, try making the grp yourself or something of the sort, it'll increases your chances of getting into mythics for sure. And about that luck of yours, your luck may be piling up for that legendary ;P</div></div><hr />

They're okeiiiish dps-wise on normals, heros and mythics, but due to mechanical problems aren't gonna be used in mythics+.<br />
Destro has some deep talent problems (while other classes have aoe rows and st rows, warlock have 3-4 rows of &quot;st, aoe or mediocre both&quot;.<br />
Demo has ramp up time in his ramp up time, so has problem with burst and target changing.<br />
Affli... is only good for fights with lots of adds. It was very used on mythics+ on beta because of the insane burst dps they could manage to do through heavy aoe specialization, resulting in very poor st damage (which is low even in st talents, as sims show. This, in fact, is one of the only 90% accurate sims - Single target.<br />
<br />
BUT, they're good outside of heavy harcore use. The problem we face now is double: Lack of famous representation (for example, Serenity has stated they're gonna have 0-1 locks on their rooster) and heavy doomsayers saying that locks are utter garbage in the game, as a general term, when they're not; those two combined make what is now happening: locks not invited to, or kicked, from parties. Not because any reasonable metric, but just because the trending is saying that &quot;locks suck&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Ion should take his own advice.<br />
<br />
Anyone who's familiar with his past behaviour during WoD will be furious that he hasn't changed ONE BIT in the intervening couple of years, despite massive criticism of his demonstrably poor performance.<br />
<br />
Specifically, he seems utterly incapable of parsing any negative feedback from any community source into broad populist vectors, let alone into narrowed feature support. If the faults and complaints are not transcribed into concise bullet-point form, it's all beyond his comprehension, and he dismisses it as &quot;non-constructive&quot;. Amazingly enough, he can fully comprehend positive feedback no matter how rambling, ambiguous and incoherent it is. Funny that, eh?<br />
<br />
Also, and what I was alluding to with the quote: Keep It Simple, Stupid! How many times have we had to endure some expansive round of crushing nerfs or wholesale mechanic changes where a simple tweak to the offending feature would do the trick? We're all familiar with it: &quot;Bliz can't balance so they remove&quot;. That's Ion, right there. Great at implementing imperfection, USELESS at evolving perfection.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Flight at some point or other renders content (yes, getting intercepted by mobs is content - encounters are the very definition of content, lack of encounters is what made WOD so...memorable...) irrelevant thus it might as well not be there. This is fine if you have some means to ensure that all experience this content (which you put in place because you believed it would make the game better overall) before finally taking to the skies to skip it, if so desired.<br />
<br />
If you put in place the means to skip from the get-go then you might as well not bother having any ground content, and rather dispense with those resources and instead just provide portals from starting point to where the quest should take place.<br />
<br />
I went ahead and got Pathfinder in WoD myself and I will certainly do the same in Legion, I believe flight is a good thing. But I also think it's good to keep it restricted both insofar as waiting with releasing it as well as making it take some effort before it's unlocked, precisely because you otherwise dispense with the need to create any story lines or living environments in the world, removing the whole point of world content.<br />
<br />
Now, if you could somehow make the air considerably more hazardous and make a realistic call where flight is viable but in some cases may be slower or more hazardous than ground travel then having flight from the start could work out just fine, but I suspect this is something they'd struggle to deliver, or it'd be in the game already.<br />

Well I don't really see how the non-raid content is any more min/max than it has been in the past outside of mythic+. Yeah mythic+ will require min maxing at higher levels, but if you have the kind of player who's not interested in doing higher difficulty levels of content, then he doesn't need to min max because he's not doing content that requires min maxing. I mean...mythic plus is exactly what more time restricted players asked for and I think it's a great idea for the reasons I said above.

It got to the point that the GM said he was letting the forums &quot;cool down&quot; over the weekend. If that many people are outraged, I don't think it is about bad players or wrong rotations. Something is definintely wrong with locks and I play frost DK which has been dead last in all the DPS meters I've seen. I don't like the &quot;Lets let the classes bake for awhile before we change anything&quot; attitude they have, its fucking ridiculous.

Look how many other classes get punched in the balls constantly and left useless and unwanted in groups and raids. WW monks in WoD were pure trash. You needed machine level perfect play for mediocre results. Who wants to play like that?! Elemental Shaman were completely useless in Cata for a while there and really there was ZERO reason to have one when they did half of everyone else's damage. Melee specs were rarely in the top 3 DPS in as long as I can remember back. People complained but never threw a pissy fit because they weren't top DPS. They changed classes for a while til their class regained it's strength again.<br />
<br />
This may be hard to grasp for you but people playing now scarcely care about what the class has been like historically. It is up to the developers to ensure that balance NOW is acceptable, not go on people's perceived grievances about how warlocks USED to be powerful. Being top of meters is a relative thing and always changing, but this is not what is being complained about. It's the fact that the class is so terrible, in so many ways.</div></div><hr />

I don't really have much to add beyond saying yeah, I raid because it's fun, not because I want the numbers. The loot is nice and a means to an end, but I do it for the journey. Having fun should be the primary reason anyone should play. I mean I suppose I can't really tell people how they should have fun, but I don't really see why people care so much about the items for the content they enjoy doing. It very does feel like people want them just because, not because they have a reason.</div></div><hr />

They've been insanely good for how long? Forever!? They may have had a bout where they weren't top dog in 11 years but they were always in the top 3 of the best DPS classes.Where do people actually get this perception? Warlocks were not in the top 3 for every MoP tier except 5.4, they weren't near the in the first tier of WoD, they weren't at the top 3 in any tier in Cataclysm at all except the one where casters reigned (and even then, if you include mage specs we actually still were not if I recall correctly) and they sure as hell suffered through most of WotLK and as far as I remember didn't even earn a top 3 spot in ICC, which was our best tier.<br />
<br />
But even if we were to pretend even for a second that that statement wasn't just pulled out of your ass, what does previous class balance matter in the current scope of game design? Sure warlocks have had times when they're awesome in the past, but even if mages sucked ass right now they'd be perfectly validated in saying &quot;Hey, you fucked up our class and gave our 'fantasy' to three different classes, if you can't fix your mess of a class design then at least make us decent DPS.&quot; It doesn't matter who's saying it or how good or not good their class is in the past.</div></div><hr />

Ret Paladins on the other hand, have a much bigger problem that is related to their mechanics, which according to the majority of our community, is abysmal.<br />
<br />
Would you like to stop talking out of your ass for a moment? Warlocks are NOT only bad numbers wise. In fact, Id argue the numbers are potentially there thought it takes A HELL of alot of work to do so. The ISSUE we currently have is the way all three specs feel gameplay wise. <br />
<br />
TLDR, you have no idea what you're talking about.</div></div><hr />

You're right, I don't. I was speaking out of emotion. But it keeps intriguing me how he only goes into detail for warlocks. Us rets have been giving negative feedback since beta, and we have NEVER gotten a response, or a detailed post like this. We have had glaring gameplay issues since beta, and all we had addressed was mobility because more people than usual were complaining. Why can't he just learn from Jeff Kaplan and only give relevant information, in this format:<br />
<br />
&quot;We hear you guys and are currently looking at these classes, we're potentially changing X because of Y&quot;<br />
<br />
Now it just feels like he gives one class more attention than the other.</div></div><hr />

Get the fuck over it. I loved the kite but come the fuck on, it's a goddamn toy not a core mechanic of the game. Then the people talking about pacing and burnout when there's someone who already has 3 level 110s geared up to 825 and the expansion hasn't even been out for two weeks yet! Some of you should really just stop playing the game, it's obvious you don't enjoy it anymore. Half of the time I think people are just making shit up to justify their complaints... saying nobody will take certain classes or people sub 835 ilvl when I started pugging mythics at 824 ilvl. <br />
<br />
I haven't enjoyed this game as much as I am right now since Wrath, and Legion so far is shaping up to be better than that even. I'm loving these Q&amp;A's too, Ion seems like a really cool dude and it's clear he cares about the game. Almost everything that was discussed in the Q&amp;A is from topics I've seen on this very forum. I have really high hopes for this expansion and I'll maintain that mindset until it's no longer true at which point I'll play something else until there's more content that I want to see.<br />

On topic, some good feedback from Ion there, sounds like they are on top of this expansion in a big way. Can only be good for us.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoceb1073a651</div><div class="date">2016-09-12, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, sorry for the luck you've had but i guess it cant be helped :/. I just wanna address the pugs and guild ilvl requirments, most mythic pugs need 825-830 (which you are in range of) few need 820 and if you are anything above 840 you will probably be insta accepted, now pugs have always had stupid requirements because they aren't organised and have no comms or such, so better gear helps clear faster. Now about your guild needing 835-840, I can only advice you to leave a guild like that, the whole point of a guild is to help each other progress through content, anything above 805 is acceptable for a guild mythic run, mythics really aren't that hard when you are organised. This is of course assuming you asked to join given that you are lower ilvl and wasn't accepted. If you do sub back again tho, try making the grp yourself or something of the sort, it'll increases your chances of getting into mythics for sure. And about that luck of yours, your luck may be piling up for that legendary ;P<br />

I have the same problem with gear drops. The only heroic itemlevel items I got come from my order hall set and some world quests. In dungeons, I almost never get anything besides artefact power and BoS, while everyone else gets at least one item per run. And in the one case where someone was generous and wanted to give an item to another because he had a better one, I could not use it either, because I already got a 840 level item from a world quest. So, I am stuck between the obliterium forge quest in terms of progressing crafted upgrades, and bad luck in dungeon drops (which is a state for me in WoW for a very long time, I have very bad luck).</div></div><hr />

I'm 849ilvl on my Outlaw Rogue and I'm literally destroying everything, instantly. I mean I'm pulling like 600k+ on packs with more than 5-6 mobs, solo mobs is a guaranteed 200k+ and they literally just fall on the ground dead. I really enjoy actually using a bit of thought and effort while questing, not just steamrolling content. This is only going to get worse in a weeks time with the release of raids :(</div></div><hr />

My main is skinner/leatherworker, so both of those result in probably a dozen or more quests that take you to every zone. Some people feel the need to accept every quest they come across, so when you are told to go to a zone you haven't been to yet, it turns out to provide with even more quests. Adding in things like Ashran quests, and boom, you are at cap.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmocc90fcf6aa1</div><div class="date">2016-09-14, 07:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is massive discontent in the Warlock community, and I assure you that it's more than the numbers. The rotation, especially for Demonology, is extremely awkward and clunky. A lot of what made a warlock a warlock was taken from the class and spread around (metamorphosis given to Demon Hunters, verdant spheres given to mages, etc.) while we got mechanics that other classes loathed (mages' Prismatic Crystal was dumped on warlocks in the form of Soul Effigy, maintenance buffs were deemed outdated but warlocks have to Lifetap or we quickly run out of mana, etc.). Dreadsteed/Felsteed mount animations are broken. And the list goes on.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Can you stop with this verdant spheres thing? Verdant spheres were part of Kael'Thas style long before your green warlock ball during MOP.<br />
<br />
If there is one true thing is that you warlocks did take this idea from mages,not the other way around. Seems to me that Kael Thas is much closer to the mage archetype than warlock. So your point?<br />
<br />
And metamorphosis never made sense for a warlock, a warlock does not want to become a demon, he wants to control them. Even for demon hunters its a weird thing lore wise since only Illidan transformed into a demon because of Guldan's skull. Conveniently in warcraft 3 all demon hunters had this metamorphosis but it did not made any sense as this transformation was acquired for Illidan specifically in the story and then retconed for this expansion<br />

<br />
Why did they give Locks such special attention, but ignored all other classes and their concerns thats been on going since early beta? Ret Paladin for example.<br />
<br />
I have a Lock.. they're fine imo.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Because warlocks whined like babies and flooded the forums with their &quot;my class is so special it deserves special treatment&quot; over all other issues. I mean its not like elemental shamans, ret paladins and hunters don't have more pressing issues than fucking damage or shard generation for the precious warlock community that wants to be broken like MOP again</div></div><hr />
