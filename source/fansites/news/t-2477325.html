<br />
Ooooor they want to show all content controlled. PTR is still an unfinished product and they feel they need to thread carefully. And as the forums are now, one bug will sound like a showstopper, and overshadow the new content.<br />
I guess they'll show us the content, then release the patch and un-encrypt the files. Personally think it's a smart move, not just for damage controll, but to show what will come, not just so far on PRT :)</div></div><hr />

I take it as a good sign because generally the PTR should get released on the heels of a preview like this as they are going to want to get their word out before the data miners start mining.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree. Context is very important to get a proper message across - especially if you show a in-development patch that may not be fully complete yet.<br />
<br />
If you don't want to watch it, then don't, the PTR should follow shortly after (latest next week, I reckon, maybe even the same day as the stream), but then don't come here spreading half-truths because you didn't know what was said about the plans for it.</div></div><hr />

Not exactly - they’ll probably just want to go over the main features and what will be available for testing first. It’s going to be a large content patch, if not probably one of the biggest. Thus, the amount of data mining that’ll be appearing will clearly need explaining before hand.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It won't be like Vashj'ir. It'll probably just be an underwater biome style zone to allow flying mounts.<br />
<br />
Although this means if there's zones intended for 8.3 we sure as hell ain't flying in them.</div></div><hr />

Indeed. He always looks tired and as if he doesn't give a crap. Should probably not stream GTA until the early hours of the morning &amp; actually try and care about his job instead. <br />

<br />
Flying under water is just called &quot;Swimming&quot;. :)<br />
The Sea Horse mounts in Vashj'ir were actually pretty fast.<br />
<br />
But in any case, they have said that it won't be a full underwater zone. And I expect flying to only unlock there once you have completed some sort of content achievement on it.</div></div><hr />

Set up outposts as you fight against the forces of time/weekly reset being so far away as you do 3-5 storyquests every tues/wednesday. Meanwhile, gather resources by doing Naga-themed WQs, mixed with &quot;PvP&quot; objectives that doesn't change anything substantial. Maybe you get a +10% hp and damage boost, so that you can run out of faceroll-y world content that much faster.<br />
These can be used to buy armor tokens that are useless to your main and still somehow irrelevant to your new 120 as well. If you gather about 50 hours worth of WQ resources you can buy... A MOUNT AND A TOY!! :D MUCH EXCITE<br />
Venture into Mechagon and do the same thing, but with more exciting gnome-themed toys!<br />
<br />
Are you tired of Battle of Dazar'alor yet? We sure are! If it wasn't introduced in the latest patch/season it shouldn't be part of the game. Time to jump straight to the newest season with the Azshara raid. Maybe there's some BoD trinket someone in your roster wants but we'll make sure to tune down those if too many people start having the idea of running an old raid (*shiver*), why look backwards when you can look forward?<br />
Oh and regular heroic dungeons drop 390 now. We also nerfed the enemies in IEs and Warfronts because they were taking a bit too long to win.<br />
<br />
We've also received some teeny tiny minor feedback about things like &quot;lack of progression, my 120 has less buttons than and feels weaker than my 110, no new abilities/talents and no motivation to grind the HoA&quot;. That is true to a fraction of our diverse playerbase but as a wise man once said when it comes to MMORPGs: <br />
You can never, ever have too many cooks and the one who tries to please everyone will be the star after the party! <br />

It's sadly obvious Blizzard would need an entire new expansion to get WoW back to a proper state.You can already tell how the new content will work. They say sandboxy and you're still mostly getting an island with new WQs doing the same thing you've forced yourself to do through 8.0 and 8.1. The new azerite trait system will not be fleshed out enough.<br />
It doesn't properly adress the underlying issues that makes people no longer care about progressing their characters. You can play all non-raid/m+ content without azerite or even rare quality gear. Everything other than premade content is designed so that you win by default. You don't foster a wanting to become more powerful by making people win per default and then say &quot;but imagine how fun it'd be to do this content again, but on a higher difficulty!&quot;</div></div><hr />

I damn sure get my monies worth and yes, I know things could be better. But it's not awful.... and unplayable... have you seen some of these other games out there? lol especially MMOs</div></div><hr />

Having said that, I'm still enjoying it :P <br />
<br />
When will the next expansion reveal be? Blizzcon in November or Gamescom in August?</div></div><hr />

I look forward to it actually, I know saying so makes me a whiteknight and a fanboi, but I guess I'd rather be those things than be some insane delusional fuck with a severe case of ex-girlfriend syndrome who just can't let go, and keeps complaining, &quot;I Swear it's her fault, not mine!&quot; in every fucking thread that comes up for years on end. <br />
<br />
Those guys are such pathetic losers...move on with your life, maybe, do you think?<br />
<br />
that example is the perfect phrase for these haters honestly. Not talking about actual players but the ones that havent played in years that constantly shit on the game for no reason. really annoying honestly</div></div><hr />

Best comment ever on this forum and very true.. Unfortunately they can't let go, as they have to have some sort of meaning in what I can gather are their miserable lives.. Heck there is one on here who keeps harping on about that other MMO that is supposed to be the best ever..<br />

Anthem E3 2017 trailer should tell you how much you should trust these companies when they sugarcoat their marketing.<br />
<br />
There is little credibility to any of their sphiel if the PTR isn't up right after the stream.<br />
<br />
I would trust Blizzard way more than EA/Bioware and the trainwreck that is Anthem..</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately I have to agree here. Blizzard is not acting like BFA is just failing and earning its place next to WoD as the 2nd worst expansion they have ever released. They are so casual about how they are responding to this disaster.<br />
<br />
Never seen a company so laid back as subscribers are leaving in droves. This expansion has done severe damage to Blizzards reputation and cost them major Twitch/Youtube contributors who are all off playing other MMO's or games.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. They don't have to trash the product lol and Ion going around blaming the players for the faults of BFA isn't helping.<br />
<br />
They do however need to just admit it has faults. No game is perfect.</div></div><hr />

I'm actually hopeful but you can't let people on this site know that<br />
<br />
Awesome post and very true indeed, I often wonder how many on this site live their lives, when you see them go on their daily tirades on this forum.. On the positive versus negative threads/posts on this forum, the negative beats the ever living crap out of the positive on these forums..<br />
<br />
Me as well am hoping for a good patch, but am not going to let it send me over the edge into angry land if it isn't, as it is just not worth it..</div></div><hr />

oh yes because they should act as the sky is falling? no lol theyre taking steps to remedy it. Most people just dont understand how hard it is to steer a massive ship though and expect things to be remedied immediately</div></div><hr />
